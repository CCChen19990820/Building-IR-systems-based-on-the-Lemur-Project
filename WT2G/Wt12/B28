<center><h2>THE DeSILVER SOCIETY</h2></center>

The ACLU has established a new society to honor those who support our civil liberties work 
through estate and charitable financial plan.  It is named after ACLU founding member Albert 
DeSilver (1888-1924), the first person to leave the ACLU a financial legacy.  Continuing a 
75-year tradition of giving for the future of civil liberties, hundreds of supporters are 
now recognized as charter members of The DeSilver Society.
<P>
Harrison DeSilver, an architect and the oldest son of Albert, recently visited the national 
office to reminisce about his father, who descended from conservative businesspeople, and 
mother Margaret, the daughter of Quakers. "My father was a superstar," said Harrison. "I 
don't know how he got interested in civil liberties -- my mother almost certainly influenced 
him."
<P>
A New Yorker and the product of Ivy League schools, Albert volunteered with the National 
Civil Liberties Bureau while practicing law.  But in 1918, he left his prestigious firm to 
engage in civil liberties work full time.  When the Bureau became the ACLU, Albert was its 
first associate director and largest financial contributor until his untimely, accidental 
death.  Margaret continued her husband's generosity and served on the national ACLU board 
for many years.
<P>
Harrison inherited his parents' social awareness, registering as a conscientious objector in 
World War II and working with Roger Baldwin on the ACLU's National Committee on Conscientious 
Objectors.
<P>
The ACLU is grateful that Albert, whom his son described as having "very high 
standards," set the standard for stewardship of our nation's constitutional heritage -- now 
recognized through The DeSilver Society.

<P><BR> Students, listen up:
</P>
<P>
An important part of our education is learning how to participate fully in the
life of this nation.  In order to participate, we need to keep in mind two very
important things.  First, the Constitution is the highest law of this land. 
Second, the Constitution has a Bill of Rights that protects the freedom of each
and every American.  That includes you and me, the young people of this country.
 So my message to you is KNOW YOUR RIGHTS and EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS.

<TITLE>ACLU - Sybil on Privacy</TITLE>
</HEAD>


<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<img src="/graphics/studenthdr.gif">
<Center><h1>Sybil on Privacy</h1></center>

In a lot of our public schools, drugs and violence are serious problems that
make it hard for teachers to teach, and for us to learn.  Coming up with
effective solutions to these problems is a tough assignment for even the best
school administrators.  Unfortunately, some school officials adopt
"solutions" that abuse students' constitutional rights.  For example, they
search us, install video cameras in our classrooms, or plant undercover cops
in the hallways and washrooms to spy on us.  Such measures treat us more
like prisoners than students.
 <P>
Remember: The Fourth Amendment guarantees you a right to privacy and the
right not to have your privacy invaded by "unreasonable searches and
seizures." It also protects your freedom to make certain decisions about your
body and your life in private, without interference from the government.<P>
<DL><DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">   <P>
<STRONG>Q: Sybil, what if I'm just hanging out in the hall and a teacher tells me to
empty out my pockets.  Do I have to do it?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: Your teacher is supposed to follow the student search guidelines
established by the United States Supreme Court in 1985, in a case called New
Jersey v. T.L.O.  The Court said that although school officials don't have
to get a search warrant before searching you, your teacher or the principal
can't search you without having a specific, good reason to suspect that you,
in particular -- not just "someone" -- broke a law or a school rule.  That
principle is known as "individualized suspicion."  AND... they must conduct
the search in a "reasonable" way, based on your age and what they're looking
for.  For example, if a teacher thinks he saw you selling drugs to another
student, he can stop you, pat you down, empty your pockets and search your
knapsack or your car -- if it's parked on school grounds.
<P> 
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: You mean teachers can't search every student in a class because they think
some of us have drugs?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: No, no and no.  Just because school officials have information that
*some* students have drugs doesn't give them the authority to search all
students.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: What about a strip search?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: Strip searching of public school students by school officials is
illegal in many states, and in others it's allowed but only under certain
conditions -- like when there's a solid reason to suspect a particular
student of having committed a *very* serious crime.
<P>                                                                                             <DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: What about the police -- can they search me on the school grounds?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: Yes, but police are held to an even higher standard than your teacher
or principal: They have to go to court and get a search warrant from a judge.
<P>
So if the cops want to search you, you tell them "no way" unless they either
<i>arrest</i> you or show you a warrant.  The warrant has to have your name or an
accurate description of you on it, and it has to state what evidence the
police are looking for and where they think they're going to find it.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Can my locker be searched?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: In some states, courts have ruled that your locker belongs to the
school, not to you, so the school can search it.  But courts in other states
have said school officials must have "reasonable suspicion" that you're
hiding something illegal before they can search your locker.  Check with your
local ACLU to find out what the law is in your state.  And give yourself a
break: Don't keep anything in your locker that you don't want other people to
see. 
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Can my school make me take a blood or urine test to find out if I use
drugs, or a breathalyzer test for alcohol?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: A drug or alcohol test is a search, but it depends what state you live
in whether the officials in your school have to have "reasonable suspicion"
that you're a user before they can make you take a test.
<P>
The ACLU has a problem with random testing programs, where officials test a
few individuals or force a whole class to be tested just because they suspect
that someone -- but nobody, in particular -- is doing drugs.  Students all
over the country have challenged such programs, and while the courts in some
states have found them unconstitutional, they've said they're okay in others.
<P>
Your local ACLU can give you the word on school drug testing in your state.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Can my school use metal detectors to check for weapons?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: In many states, yes, because requiring someone to pass through a metal
detector is regarded as less an invasion of privacy than frisks or other
kinds of searches.  Still, some states recommend that school officials follow
certain guidelines to protect students' rights.  California, for example,
allows metal detectors in its schools, but it says they can't be used
selectively   just on certain students.  That would be discrimination.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Sybil, you said my right to privacy includes the freedom to make certain
decisions about my body -- like deciding whether to have sex or have babies.
Can you tell me where to go for a pregnancy test, medical care if I'm
pregnant or an abortion? </STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: You go to the nearest family planning clinic.  If you can't find a
clinic, call your local ACLU to get the name of one.  Family planning clinics
will give you birth control information, counseling and a pregnancy test, and
some clinics also perform abortions and provide prenatal care.  If the clinic
you go to doesn't have one or more of the services you want, ask them to
refer you to a place that does.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Can I get birth control supplies without my parents being told?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD> SYBIL: What you do or don't do with your body is nobody's business but yours.
But you should be aware that although a doctor can legally write you a
prescription for birth control, he or she doesn't have to.  Also, a doctor
has the choice of telling or not telling your parents, so you should ask what
his or her policy is.  Your school may provide birth control supplies.  Check
it out.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Would my parents and boyfriend have to be told if I decided to get an
abortion?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: First of all, it's your constitutional right to have an abortion -- be
clear about that.  <i>No</i> state requires you to seek your boyfriend's approval,
but some states have laws that require young women under the age of 18 to get
permission from their parents, or to tell their parents about the abortion. 
If you <I>can't</i> tell your parents, you may be able to go to court and ask the
judge to drop the parental notification requirement in your particular case. 
Your local ACLU office can refer you to a family planning counselor who will
help you.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Suppose I want to be tested for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  Can I
get  tested without my parents knowing?  Does <i>anyone</i> have to know?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: Some states require that your parents be notified before you get
tested or get treatment.  Your local ACLU can inform you about how the laws
in your state apply to HIV testing of minors, and where you can get tested
without anyone knowing.  By the way: If your school or employer is trying to
<EM>force</EM>you to be tested for HIV, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE.
<P>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%"> 
<P>
</dl>
Your local ACLU office can answer any questions you may have about your right
to privacy in school and your other constitutional rights.

<Center><h1>Sybil on Due Process</h1></center>

<dl>
<center><EM>"The Fourteenth Amendment protects the citizen
against the state itself <br>and all of its
creatures -- Boards of Education not excepted."</EM> <BR>
<STRONG>U.S. Supreme Court <BR>
West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette (1943)</STRONG><BR></center>
<P>
The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees everyone in the United States -- young
people included -- the right to "due process of law."  This means you have
the right to be treated fairly by people who are in positions of authority, such
as teachers, school administrators or the police.  For example, if a teacher
or school official accuses you of having done something wrong and wants to
suspend you, you have the right to a hearing so you can tell your side of the
story.  This right was recognized in 1975 by a U.S. Supreme Court decision in
a case called Goss v. Lopez, which involved some high school students who
had been suspended without a hearing.
<P>
Your right to due process also means that if you're found guilty of
something, the punishment can't be more serious than the misconduct was.  In
other words, you can't be expelled for a minor violation, or for doing
something for which other kids just got detention.
<P>
Keep in mind that if you go to a private school, your due process rights may
be different since private schools have a lot more freedom to make their own
rules.  Also, remember that the laws in your state may give you other
protections in addition to what the federal Constitution provides.  You can
find out about your state's laws from your local ACLU office.
<P>      <IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<dt>
<STRONG>Q: What are my rights if I'm about to be suspended?</STRONG>
 <P>
<DD>SYBIL: If you're facing a suspension of any length of time, you have the
right to notice of the charges against you.  "Notice" means being told
exactly what you did that was wrong.  You also have a right to a hearing
before a person or people who're impartial -- they don't have any kind of
attitude toward you, one way or the other.  If you're facing serious
punishment, like suspension for more than 10 days, then you have the right to
be represented by a lawyer, who can call witnesses; to question or cross-
examine your accusers and the witnesses against you, and to have a record
made of everything that happens at the hearing for you to use if you want to
appeal the decision.
<P>         <IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%"> 
<P><dt>
<STRONG>Q: Do I have the right to a hearing every time my principal or teacher wants
to  punish me?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: No, not every time.  The general rule is that you have the right to a
hearing for serious punishments but not for minor ones.  For example, if your
teacher makes you sit at the back of the class for being noisy, you're not
entitled to a hearing.  But you are entitled to one if your teacher
recommends suspending you. 
<P>        
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%"> 
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Doesn't the school have to let me know what I've been accused of before
suspending or expelling me?</STRONG>
 <P>
<DD>SYBIL: It sure does.  As I said before, you have the right to a hearing for
any serious punishment.  At the very least, the school has to give you
written or oral notice of the charges against you.  If you deny the charges,
they have to tell you what evidence they have and give you a chance to tell
your side of the story.  The only way they can suspend or expel you without
notice or a hearing is if they think you are a danger to other students or to
school property.  But even in that case, they should give you notice or a
hearing as soon as possible after they have kicked you out.
<P>    
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%"> 
<P>
<STRONG>Q: What can I be suspended for, anyway?</STRONG>
 <P>
<DD>SYBIL: It really depends on what state you live in, since each state has its
own laws about a public school's authority to suspend students.  Most school
officials regard suspension as an extreme punishment and use it only as a
last resort.  Often, they don't suspend unless a student does something
illegal, dangerous or disruptive.  The same goes for expulsion, although in
a lot of states expulsion is illegal based on the principle that everyone has
the right to an education.
 <P>       
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%"> 
<P>
<STRONG>Q: What if a cop or a teacher starts grilling me in school -- do I have to
answer their questions?</STRONG>
 <P>
<DD>SYBIL: No you don't.  Even in school, "you have the right to remain
silent...."  Sometimes there's nothing wrong with your answering a few
questions just to clear up something, but in general my advice to is this: If
you get the impression that the teacher or the cop suspects you of having
committed a crime, don't explain, don't lie, don't confess.  Tell them you're
not going to talk until you speak with your parents or a lawyer.
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%"> 
<P>
<STRONG>Q: What if I'm stopped by the police outside of school?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: If a cop stops you on the street and tells you that you're a suspect
in a crime, tell him or her immediately that you want a lawyer.  Never, never
try to talk your way out of whatever it is. Always ask for an attorney, and
don't give any information except your I.D.  It's legal for the cop to frisk
you for weapons.  If the cop asks to search you and/or your car, don't resist
the search but make it clear that you're not consenting to it.
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%"> 
<P>
<STRONG>Q: I'm under 18. What happens if I'm arrested?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: In most states, young people under 18 are treated as "juveniles";
they're not handled through the regular criminal justice system.  This means
you have the right to get in touch with a parent or guardian as soon as
you're arrested.  And in most states, you can be released into the custody of
your parents, a guardian or a probation officer instead of being held at a
detention center.  In most states, you would get a hearing in juvenile court
rather than in adult criminal court, although in some states -- New York, for
example -- you have to be under 16 to go to juvenile court.  If you're
charged, given a hearing and convicted of a crime, you could be sentenced to
a probation period, an educational or rehab program or time in a juvenile
prison.  Also, your school will be told if you were arrested for a violent or
drug-related crime.
 <P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%"> 
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Isn't it illegal for a teacher to hit me?</STRONG>
 <P>
<DD>SYBIL: In at least 21 states, corporal punishment -- that's what it's called
when teachers punish kids by hitting them -- is totally banned.  Some states
allow it in their school systems, but only under certain circumstances and
only if the physical punishment isn't "unreasonable and unnecessary" or
"excessive."  A teacher is certainly not supposed to hurt you, so if one does
then contact your local ACLU.
<P>
A lot of adults have sense enough to know that hitting students is harmful
and definitely not the way to make us learn, and there's an organized
movement to ban corporal punishment nationwide.
<P>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">

</dL>
Your local ACLU can answer any questions you may have about your right to due
process in school and your other constitutional rights.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<Center><h1>Sybil on Students Rights</h1></center>
<P>
<P>
Our public education system exists to provide an education to <b>all</b> students,
equally.  This principle was established as the law of the land by the 1954
U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case called Brown v. Board of Education.
The Constitution guarantees your right not to be discriminated against in
school based on your race, ethnic background, religion or sex, and regardless
of whether your family is rich or poor.
<P>
In addition to that constitutional protection, lots of federal, state and
local laws also protect students against discrimination based on disability,
pregnancy and sexual orientation.
<P><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<DL>
<DT><b>Q: Sybil, the coach wouldn't let me join the soccer team just because I'm a
girl.  Can he do that?</b>
<P><DD>
SYBIL:Sports programs in public schools aren't allowed to discriminate
against girls or boys, which means that a sports activity can't be offered
only to boys or only to girls.  Some schools make exceptions for contact
sports like football, or where students have to compete with each other on
the basis of skill for places on a particular team.  In most places, a school
can set up separate teams for girls and boys as long as the sport is offered
to both sexes.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<B>Q: I'm gay and I want to bring a guy, as my date, to the senior prom.  Can
school officials say no to that?</b>
<DD><P>
SYBIL: They might, although in the one case where this issue came before a
court, the court ruled that preventing a gay student from bringing his male
date to a school dance violated his rights.  Whether you're lesbian, gay or
straight, as a public school student you're entitled to the same privileges
as any other student, and school officials aren't supposed to violate your
rights just because they may not like your sexual orientation.
<BR>
Unfortunately, while a small (though increasing) number of states and
municipalities have passed laws that forbid discrimination based on sexual
orientation, public high schools have been slow to establish their own
anti-bias codes and slow to respond to incidents of harassment and
discrimination against lesbian and gay students.  So even though, in theory,
you can take a guy to the prom, join or help form a gay group at school or
write an article about lesbian/gay issues for the school paper, in practice
gay students still have to fight hard to have their rights respected.
<BR>
If you feel you're being mistreated by students, teachers or the school
administration because you're gay, your local ACLU can tell you how to fight
back.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<B>Q: What if I'm pregnant, Sybil?  Can I be kept out of school?</b>
<P><DD>
SYBIL: No. School officials are not allowed to keep you from attending
classes, graduation ceremonies, extracurricular activities or any other
school activity -- except maybe a strenuous sport.  There's a federal law
called Title IX (9) of the Education Amendments of 1972 that bans schools
from discriminating against
married or pregnant students.  You have as much right to a high school
education as any other student.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<B>Q: I truly believe my teacher gives me a hard time just because I'm a person
of color.  Is there anything I can do to change that?</B>
<P><DD>
SYBIL: Yes there is, and you *should* do something.  The federal
Constitution, state constitutions *and* various federal and state laws all
forbid the personnel and administrators at your school from discriminating
against you because of your race, the country you or your family came from
originally or your religion.  If you feel that you or someone you know is
being discriminated against, speak up: Talk to a teacher, the principal, the
head of a community organization or a lawyer so they can investigate the
situation.  If necessary, you can take legal action.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<B>Q: I tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  Do I have the
right to be treated the same as other students?</b>
<P><DD>
SYBIL: Yes!  The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) protects people with
HIV disease against discrimination in schools and in many other "public
accommodations," such as stores, museums and
hotels.  This means you have the right to go to school like any other
student.
<BR>
It's a medical fact that the AIDS virus can't be spread through casual
contact.  That's why the ADA, as well as other federal and local laws, forbid
discrimination against people like yourself.  You're not a threat to other
people's health just by having HIV or AIDS.  If you think your school is
discriminating against you because you're HIV-positive, contact your local
ACLU for information about what legal action you should take.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<B>Q: My school uses a tracking system, and most of the kids in the bottom
tracks are from poor and minority families.  Isn't that discrimination?</b>
<DD><P>
SYBIL: It sure looks that way, doesn't it?  Almost all public schools have
tracking systems that're supposed to separate students according to learning
ability, but studies have revealed that factors other than learning ability
may be determining which of us get placed in which tracks.
<BR>
The standards and tests school officials use in deciding on track placements
are often based on racial and class prejudices and stereotypes, rather than
on our real abilities and learning potential.  As a result, it's usually the
white, middle-class kids who end up in the college prep classes, while poor
and non-white students, and kids whose first language isn't English, end up
in "slow" tracks and vocational-training classes.  And often, the lower the
track you're in, the less you're taught.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<B>Q: Can I challenge my placement in a particular track?</b>
<P><DD>
SYBIL: If it's not the track you want to be in, you should.  All the tracks
are supposed to give the same courses -- the higher tracks on a more advanced
level, the lower tracks on a less advanced level but, basically, the same
education.  If the track they put you in gives you a completely different
education than you would get in the highest track, then make an issue of it.
<BR>
Even if you have low grades or nobody in your family ever went to college, if
you want to go to college then you should demand the type of education you
need to realize your dreams.  And your guidance counselor should help you get
it!  Your local ACLU can tell you the details of how to go about challenging
your track placement.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<b>Q: I'm not an American citizen.  Do I have the same constitutional rights
citizens have?</b>
<DD><P>
Sybil: Yes!  If you're a permanent resident -- that is, a "green card" holder
-- or even if you're in the U.S. illegally, you're still entitled to the same
constitutional protections an American citizen receives.  All of the rights
set forth in the Constitution's Bill of Rights are guaranteed to *all* people
living in this country, regardless of their nationality or citizenship
status.  And even if you're not a citizen, you have the right to a free
public education -- which means the administrators of your school can't treat
you any differently from any other student.
<P>
<DT><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
Your local ACLU office can answer other questions you have about your right
to equal treatment in school and your other constitutional rights.

<TITLE>ACLU - Sybil on Religion</TITLE>
</HEAD>


<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<img src="/graphics/studenthdr.gif">
<Center><h1>Sybil on Religion</h1></center>

Religious liberty -- the right of each and every American to practice his or
her own religion, or no religion at all -- is among the most fundamental of
the freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.  The principle of religious
liberty, because it is built into our Constitution, has kept the United
States relatively free of the kind of religious conflict that has torn many
nations apart.  The founders of this country, who were themselves of
different religious beliefs and backgrounds, thought that the best way to
protect religious liberty in their new nation was to keep the government out
of religion.  That's why they created the First Amendment.  In addition to
guaranteeing free speech and a free press, the First Amendment says that the
government   <EM> "... shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . ."</EM>
<P>
Both parts of this guarantee of religious liberty, the Establishment Clause
and the Free Exercise Clause, apply to public schools since public schools
are part of the government (they don't apply to private and parochial
schools).
<P>
The Establishment Clause guarantees the separation of church and state by
prohibiting the government from supporting or promoting religion in any way.
The government can't "establish" Christianity or any other religion as the
official religion of the United States; it can't provide financial support
for any religion, and it can't promote or endorse any religious beliefs or
practices.  The Free Exercise Clause means that you are free to worship as
you choose, and that the government can't penalize you because of your
religious beliefs.
<P>
In a series of decisions dating back to the early 1960s, the courts have
created the following constitutional standards that public schools are
supposed to respect when it comes to religion: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Schools cannot plan or sponsor religious observances or prayers.
<LI> Schools can teach about the roles and influences of religion in history,
literature and philsophy, but they cannot promote religious beliefs or
practices as part of the curriculum.
<LI> Students are free to pray on their own or otherwise express their
religious beliefs in school, so long as they don't cause a disruption in
class.
<LI> Students can be excused from some school activities -- but not from
academic courses -- if those activities conflict with their religious
beliefs.  For example, if you're a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses, who
oppose saluting the flag, then you can't be forced to salute the flag.
</ul>
<P>    
<dl>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P> 
<dt><STRONG>Q: Sybil, Can teachers start off the school day with a prayer, a reading from
the scriptures or a moment of silence?</STRONG>
<P>
<dd>Sybil: No, they can't.  The Supreme Court has ruled that prayers, scriptural
readings and even moments of silence are unconstitutional in public schools
because they amount to government promotion of a religious belief or
practice.  Even if the school has described the prayer as
"non-denominational," the government is still promoting religion in violation
of the First Amendment.
<P>       
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P> 
<STRONG>Q: Can my school invite a member of the clergy to give a nonsectarian prayer
at graduation?</STRONG>
<P>
<dd>Sybil: Prayers at graduations used to be common, but in 1992 the Supreme
Court ruled that the practice violates the Establishment Clause because it
forces all graduating students, including non-believers, to participate in a
government-sponsored religious exercise.  This important ruling came in a
case called Lee v. Weisman.  The Court explained that including a prayer in
the graduation ceremony, whether the prayer was led by a minister, a priest
or a rabbi, would give any student who objected "a reasonable perception that
she is being forced by the State to pray in a manner her conscience will not
allow."  That's exactly what the First Amendment is supposed to prevent.
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P> 
<STRONG>Q: Is it constitutional if students vote to have a student-led  prayer at
graduation?</STRONG>
<P>
<dd>Sybil: No, it isn't. Think about it: Letting students make the decision to
have a student deliver a prayer doesn't make the graduation ceremony any less
a school-sponsored event, does it?  And while a majority of students may vote
to pray in a certain way, the minority of students who hold different
beliefs, or no religious beliefs at all, will feel excluded from their own
graduation exercises.  The thing to understand is that where fundamental
freedoms, like freedom of speech and freedom of religion, are concerned, the
principle of "majority rule" doesn't apply.  Those freedoms belong to each of
us no matter what -- they cannot be voted away.
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P> 
<STRONG>Q: Could my school hold a separate graduation event, like a baccalaureate,
for students who want to pray?</STRONG>
 <P>
<dd>Sybil: The school itself could not sponsor such an alternative event, but
student, parent or church groups could -- off of school grounds.
<P>        
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P> 
<STRONG>Q: Is it ever okay to pray in school?</STRONG>
<P>
<dd>Sybil: Sure. Individual students have the right to pray whenever they want
to, as long as they don't disrupt classroom instruction or other educational
activities.  For example, a student can say grace before eating lunch or pray
before taking an exam.  If a school official has told you that you can't pray
at all during the school day, then your free speech and free exercise rights
are being violated and you should contact your local ACLU for help.
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P> 
<b>Q: Other than the standards you mentioned before, is there anything else
school officials can turn to for constitutional guidance regarding religion?</b>
<P>
<dd>Sybil: Actually, there is. In instances where school officials aren't quite
sure about a policy they have adopted or are considering, they can give it
the "Lemon Test," which takes its name from a 1971 Supreme Court decision in
a case called Lemon v. Kurtzman.  A public school policy that fails any one
of the following three parts of the Lemon Test is unconstitutional.
<P>
1. The policy must have a non-religious purpose.  Example: In 1985, the U.S.
Supreme Court struck down Alabama's moment-of-silence law because the whole
point of the law was to encourage prayer, which is a clearly religious
practice.
<P>
2. The policy must not have the effect of promoting or favoring any set of
religious beliefs.  For example, putting up a Christmas display in school
that includes such religious symbols as a creche sends a message that the
school prefers students whose religions celebrate Christmas over other
students.
<P>
3. The policy must not overly "entangle" the school with religion.  Suppose
some graduating seniors and their parents decided to hold a religious
baccalaureate service before graduation exercises at a local church, and the
school principal took it upon him or herself to review the content of the
service ahead of time.  That would "excessively entangle" the school with
religious matters beyond what the constitution allows.
<P>     
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%"> <dt>
<P> 
<STRONG>Q: My school often holds holiday parties.  Is that constitutional?</STRONG>
 <P>
<dd>Sybil: It depends. A holiday event that includes making Christmas stockings,
Easter eggs or valentines is probably okay because, while those activities
used to be associated with a religious tradition, over the years they've
become secular customs that young people of many different backgrounds enjoy.
But  a Nativity pageant, which is full of religious meaning, or a school concert
that featured only religious music would be unconstitutional.
<P>   
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P> 
<STRONG>Q: Some people distribute Bibles at my school every year.  Is that
constitutional?</STRONG>
<P>
<dd>Sybil: No. The distribution of Bibles during the school day definitely
violates the Establishment Clause.  Even if teachers don't actually
participate in handing out the Bibles, and even if the Bibles are not used as
part of the school's educational program, the public school building or
grounds are still being used to spread a religious doctrine at a time when
students are required to be there.
<P>    
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P> 
<STRONG>Q: Can I organize a Bible club at school?</STRONG>
<P>
<dd>Sybil: Yes, the Supreme Court has ruled that student-organized Bible clubs
are allowed if several conditions are met.  First, the activity must take
place during non-school hours; Bible club or prayer meetings during regular
school hours would violate the Establishment Clause.  Second, the school must
make its facilities available to all student groups on an equal basis.  If
your Bible club is the only group allowed to have access to the school
grounds, then that violates the Establishment Clause.  Vice versa, if the
school lets other student groups use the building for meetings and events but
won't grant your Bible club the same privilege, then your right to free
speech is being violated.  Third, school officials cannot have anything to do
with organizing or running the Bible club.

<center><i>"It can hardly be argued that either students or<br>
teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom<br>
of speech . . . at the schoolhouse gates." </i><br>
<STRONG>U.S. Supreme Court <BR>
Tinker v. Des Moines (1969)</STRONG>  </center>
<P>
The First Amendment guarantees our right to free expression and free
association, which means we have the right to think what we like, say what we
like and write what we like; we can form clubs and organizations, and take
part in demonstrations and rallies.  We have the right to do all of that, not
only in our homes or on the street, but also in school.  Keep in mind,
though, that private schools have more leeway to set their own rules on free
expression than public schools do.
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Sybil, you mean I can speak my mind <i>in school</I>?</STRONG>
<P>
<dd>SYBIL: Yes you can.  You have a constitutional right to express your opinions
and beliefs in school, as long as you do so in a way that doesn't disrupt
classes or other school activities.  If you hold a protest on the school
steps and block the entrance to the building, then school officials can stop
you.  They can also stop you from using language that they think is "vulgar
or obscene," so you'll have an easier time if you can say what you have to
say without using "bad" words or sexual references.  The main point is that
your right to free speech is <i>absolute</I> unless the principal can prove that
you are "materially and substantially" disrupting the work and routine of the
school. 
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Some friends of mine and I want to hand out copies of a newspaper we put
together -- our own paper.  Can we do that?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL:You sure can.  You have a right to hand out your paper, even if it
contains some unpopular viewpoints, without interference from the principal
or teachers.  Again, the only reason school officials would be justified in
stopping you is if you're disrupting school activities in a serious way.  I
have to tell you, though, dealing with controversial topics in the official
school paper can be sticky.
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: You mean if I wanted to publish an article in the school paper that calls
for sex education and condom distribution, or an article on drug abuse, I might
have a problem?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: Right.  Even though your article discusses something important that a
lot of people are talking about, you might have a problem because of a
decision the U.S. Supreme Court handed down in 1988.  The Court ruled, in a
case called Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, that public school
administrators can censor student speech in official school activities --
like a school play, art exhibit, newspaper or yearbook -- if the
administrators think what the students are saying is "inappropriate" or
"harmful." 
<P>
Of course, you have a right to that "inappropriate" or "harmful" viewpoint
and you *can* express it, but only through unofficial channels that aren't
paid for by the school -- like your own paper, leaflets or buttons that you
created and paid for.  As long as your expression doesn't involve school
money or cause a disruption, it's okay.
<P>
Fortunately, some states -- including Colorado, California, Iowa, Kansas and
Massachusetts -- have "High School Free Expression" laws that protect
students' free speech rights.  Check with your local ACLU to find out if your
state has such a law. 
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Suppose one of my teachers is always late to class; he makes insulting 
remarks to us; he's halfhearted about his work, and I don't like it.  Can 
I write about him in the school paper?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: Definitely.  It's your right to criticize how the people who run your
school do their jobs.  But your criticism has to be responsible and not
"libelous."  If you print something about your teacher that you know isn't
true just to make him or her look bad, that's *libel* and you could get in
trouble.
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Can I wear buttons or other non-verbal symbols in school to express
what I think?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: Yes, you can wear buttons or T-shirts with messages on them as long as
they're not disruptive -- and by the way, just because someone doesn't like
the message doesn't mean you're being disruptive.  This right was recognized
by the Supreme Court in 1969 in a case called Tinker v. Des Moines
Independent Community School District.  In that case, the Court ruled that
high school students could wear black arm bands to school to protest the
Vietnam War.
<P>
More recently, in 1992, a federal court ruled in favor of three California
high school seniors represented by the ACLU who were suspended for wearing
gang symbols while they were being photographed for the school yearbook.  The
court said wearing the symbols didn't cause a major disruption and was
protected by the First Amendment.
 <P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Can I dress or wear my hair any way I want when I'm at school?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: That depends on the laws in your state.  In some states, courts have
ruled that students can wear their hair however they want as long as the
hairstyle isn't a safety hazard (for example, if your hair is very long you'd
have to tie it back during a science experiment).  Courts in other states
have allowed schools to impose hair codes, and where hair codes are
permitted, so are dress codes.  Some schools say they need these codes to
prevent gang activity and violence.  Check with your local ACLU about the
laws in your state.
<P>
If your school has hair and dress codes you think are unfair and you want to
challenge them, just be aware that a court probably won't overturn the codes
unless the judge finds that they're really unreasonable, or that they
discriminate against certain students.
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Can I be forced to say the Pledge of Allegiance?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: No.  Some people don't want to say the Pledge on religious grounds,
because they disagree with the words in some way or as a silent protest
against our government's foreign or domestic policies.  You have the right to
sit or stand silently during the Pledge if you choose.
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: Can I pray in school?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL: Absolutely. You can pray on the school grounds as a private activity
-- for example, in a classroom between classes or in the cafeteria before you
eat lunch.  But the Constitution forbids school officials from imposing *any*
religion on students by dictating when and where they can pray, or by making
prayer a part of the school curriculum.
<P>
<dt><IMG SRC="/graphics/redline.gif" width="100%">
<P>
<STRONG>Q: My school library doesn't have certain books because my principal thinks
they're "inappropriate" for us.  Is that censorship?</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>SYBIL:  It's censorship if the principal's reasons for not allowing the books
are "narrowly partisan or political," meaning he just doesn't agree with the
authors' viewpoints.  In a 1982 case called Board of Education, Island Trees
Union Free School District No. 26 v. Pico, the Supreme Court ruled that the
members of a school board couldn't remove books from a school library just
because they didn't agree with their content.  But in many communities around
the country, school administrators and librarians are under heavy pressure
from religious groups to censor what we read and study.
<P>
I say: No one has any business deciding what we can and cannot read.  You,
your teachers and the school librarian can challenge book censorship at your
school in court.  The freedom to read is the freedom to think.  That's
something worth fighting for!
<P>

<CENTER><H2>ACLU Client - Deborah Weisman</H2></CENTER>
<img src="/graphics/dweisman.jpg" align=left><blockquote><br>
<font size=4>Hi, I'm Deborah Weisman.  My involvement with the issue of church/state
separation began in 1986 when my older sister, Merith, was graduating from
junior high in Providence, Rhode Island.  I'll never forget how uncomfortable
I felt when a Baptist minister led us in a prayer at the ceremony.  I had
always felt that religion is important and has its place, but I didn't think
a public school was that place.  My parents sent the school a letter that was
never answered.
<P></blockquote><br clear=all><br> 
Three years later, just before my own eighth grade graduation, my parents
called the school to bring up the prayer issue again.  A teacher told them,
"We got you a rabbi."  They thought we objected to the minister just because
we're Jewish!  But a rabbi wouldn't have made it any better: Prayer in public
school was what we objected to.  The school board told us that graduation
prayer was a tradition.  If we had a problem with the practice, they said, we
could sue.  And that's just what we did. The ACLU of Rhode Island  assigned
us a lawyer, who asked the federal court to order the school board to stop
having graduation prayers.  The court ruled in our favor, the school board
appealed,  we won again, and the school board appealed again -- this time to
the U.S. Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court hears less than 5 percent of the
cases brought before it, so we were surprised when the Justices agreed to
hear our case.
<P>
Almost three years after my eighth grade graduation and nine days after my
high school commencement (where there was no prayer), we won: When a public
school sponsors a prayer of any faith, the Supreme Court said, it violates
the First Amendment.
<P>
Throughout the years of waiting for a ruling, we were harassed by hate mail
and even death threats, and the media attention often bothered me.  But I was
encouraged by the support we received from friends, and at no time did I
regret having taken our case to court.  What amazes me is that it only took
me and my family to make a difference.</font>
<P>

<CENTER><H2>ACLU Client - James Acton</H2></CENTER>
<font size=4>
<img src="/graphics/acton.jpg" align=left><blockquote>Hi. My name is James Acton and I am challenging my school district's drug
testing policy because I believe in the right guaranteed to me by the Fourth
Amendment of the United States Constitution. Its says we have the right &quot;to
be secure in our persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable
searches.&quot;
<p>This right prevents our houses from being searched against our will without a
search warrant.  Just as the government should not be allowed to search our
house without a warrant, finding things we may wish to be private, the
government should not be allowed to search our bodies either. This would say
that our bodies are less private than our homes.</blockquote><br clear=all>
<p>
Making kids take a drug test without any proof that they are taking drugs is
just like searching a house without a warrant or proof of something wrong.
<p>The Vernonia School District in Oregon, where I live, had no reason to think
I was taking drugs. I wanted to play sports and I was one of the smartest
kids in the class. I never even got a referral to the principal's office. I
thought that was proof enough that I wasn't taking drugs. So I refused to
take the test.
<p>I think what I did has been made into a big deal. But I think I did the right
thing and other people should also stand up for their beliefs. The government
has no business searching our bodies, or our houses, without a warrant. This
is part of our Constitution, which is an important part of our nation.
<p>It may seem a little difficult to believe that a 12-year-old thought of this
all by himself. But its not too difficult to understand the right to privacy.
I think everybody should be taught that they have that right, before its
taken away.

<CENTER><H2>ACLU Client - Josh Berger</H2></CENTER>
<font size=4>
<img src="/graphics/berger.gif" align=left> <blockquote><br>Josh Berger is my name.  I'm from Rensselaer, Indiana.  When I was ten and in
the fifth grade, my dad wrote a letter to my school complaining about the
fact that the Gideon Society distributed Bibles in the school every year. The
Gideons are very up front about wanting to convert people to their type of
Christianity.  My family is an interfaith family -- my dad is Jewish and my
mother is Protestant -- so they're very particular about the kind of
religious teaching they want for me and my sister.  Although I usually go
with my mom to the church where she's an elder, religion is a personal matter
in our house.
<P></blockquote><br clear=all>
My dad expected that his complaint would settle things.  He never thought he
would have to go to court.  But when the school responded in a hostile way,
he went to the ACLU for help in filing suit.  At the trial, the school
superintendent testified that the school wasn't really pushing any type of
religion by letting the Gideons distribute their Bibles because, she said,
anyone could walk into the school and pass out religious materials if they
wanted to.  My mom, who's a teacher in the school district, knew that wasn't
true.  She knew the school officials would not have allowed any other kinds
of religious materials to be distributed.  Two older kids who are friends of
mine testified for our side.
<P>
Even though our town is a rural place where people don't like to make waves,
many of the neighbors, teachers and churchpeople supported us.  None of the
kids stopped being friends with me, even though some of their parents
disagreed with us.
<P>
We won our lawsuit.  After the federal district court ruled in favor of the
school, the appellate court overturned that ruling and agreed with us that
the Bible distribution was unconstitutional.  Since the U.S. Supreme Court
refused the school's request to review the case, our victory stands.

<img src="/graphics/courthdr.gif">
<CENTER><H2>ACLU Clients - Jeff and Jon Pyle</H2></CENTER>
<font size=4>
<img src="/graphics/pyle.jpg" align=left><blockquote> Jeff and Jon Pyle are from South Hadley, Massachusetts.  In May of 1993
they sued their high school in federal court over the censorship of message
T-shirts.
<P>
The case started when Jeff wore a T-shirt to gym class which read, "Coed
Naked Band -- Do It To the Rhythm."  Halfway through the class his gym
</blockquote><br clear=all>
teacher told him he would not be allowed to wear the shirt again because it
created an "emotionally unhealthy environment" in her class.  When he wore it
again to assert his First Amendment right to freedom of expression, he was
sent to the office for insubordination.
<P>
Jeff appealed the charge to the school committee, which responded by
introducing the most restrictive dress code in the state of Massachusetts.
The code banned all messages which the committee found to be "obscene, lewd
or vulgar," any message which "demean[ed]" individuals or groups on the basis
of race, sex, color, national origin or sexual orientation, and messages
which advertised alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs. 
<P>
Jeff argued before the committee that the proposed code was
unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, but to no avail.
The committee passed it.  When Jeff realized that the school committee would
not take his arguments seriously he and his brother sued in federal court. 
 <P>
During this time, the Pyle brothers wore several other T-shirts to
school to protest the censorship and test out the new code.  Jon was allowed
to wear a shirt reading, "Coed Naked Gerbils -- Some People Will Censor
Anything."  But he was sent home for wearing a shirt saying, "See Dick Drink,
See Dick Drive, See Dick Die, Don't Be a Dick."  Jeff wore a shirt which had
a picture of two men kissing on it and the words "Read My Lips." No one
objected.  But he was thrown out of school for wearing a shirt reading "Coed
Naked Civil Liberties -- Do It To the Amendments."  
<P>
In court, the Pyles persuaded the judge to overturn the part of the
dress code banning all "demeaning" messages.  This was the first time a "hate
speech" code had been struck down at the high school level.  But the judge
upheld the part of the code banning "lewd, profane or vulgar" speech, saying
that school committees, as elected officials, reflect the moral fiber of
their community and can decide what is and is not "vulgar" for other people's
children.
<P>
The Pyles, like Justice Harlan, believe that "one man's vulgarity is
another's lyric," and that school officials have no business censoring
whatever they find offensive.  They appealed the unfavorable part of the
district court's decision to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  But
the First Circuit, instead of deciding the case, certified a question to the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts asking for an interpretation of a
Massachusetts state law which protects student free expression.
<P>
The Supreme Court of Massachusetts must decide if under the law,
T-shirts which could reasonably be considered vulgar," but which cause no
disruption or disorder can be banned in schools.  This is where the case is now.</font>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">ACLU Fact Sheet on the Juvenile Justice System</H1>
<P>A movement has taken hold nationally to undermine the juvenile justice 
system, and erase any distinction between young offenders and adult criminals. 
In the past two years, almost all 50 states have overhauled their juvenile
justice laws, allowing more youths to be tried as adults and scrapping long-time
protections to help rehabilitate delinquent kids and prevent future crimes.</P>
<P>On the federal level, members of Congress have proposed legislation designed
to gut crime prevention programs and use the expiration of the Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 this September as an opportunity to
dismantle the preventive and rehabilitative goals of the nation's juvenile
justice system.  </P>
<P>The juvenile justice system has its roots in the beginning of the century,
when the mistreatment of juveniles became a focus of the Progressive Movement. 
By 1925, nearly every state had adopted laws providing for separate juvenile
proceedings that centered on prevention and rehabilitation, rather than
retribution and punishment.  </P>
<P>Now federal and state lawmakers are rushing to turn the juvenile justice
system completely upside down.   If this backward trend isn't halted, the
consequences will be disastrous -- not only for an entire generation of our
nation's youth who will be condemned to prison, but for all of us who will be
left with  a more violent society.  </P>
<P>The current debate over juvenile crime is being dominated by two voices:
elected officials seizing on quick-fix solutions, and a media more intent on
reporting violent crimes than successful prevention efforts.  Below are some
little-known, but basic facts on juvenile crime:</P>
<H2>What Ever Happened to Prevention?</H2>
<P>Crime prevention programs work and are cost-effective.  They have been shown
to reduce crime substantially when compared to imprisonment after crimes have
been committed.</P>
<UL>
<LI> The most comprehensive study done in this area recently concluded that
crime prevention costs less than imprisonment.  Early intervention programs that
try to steer young people from wrongdoing -- modest graduation incentives, for
example, or intense delinquent supervision -- can prevent as much 250 crimes per
$1 million spent.  In contrast, the report said investing the same amount in
prisons would prevent only 60 crimes a year.  <I>(Greenwood, Peter, et al.,
Diverting Children from a Life of Crime, Measuring Costs and Benefits, RAND
Corporation, (1996)).</I>
</LI>
<LI> Dozens of crime prevention programs across the country have been held up
as successful models.  Recently, Connecticut commissioned the first state-wide
evaluation of its alternative to sentencing program for juveniles.  The report
concluded that young offenders sentenced to alternative programs have a
significantly lower rate of rearrest than juveniles sentenced to adult
correctional facilities. <I> (Longitudinal Study: Alternatives to Incarceration
Sentencing Evaluation, Year 2, Full Report, State of Connecticut, Judicial
Branch, at 84, 89-91 (April 1996)).</I>
</LI></UL>
<P>Yet, we are spending more and more on corrections, and less on prevention
efforts:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Both California and Florida currently spend more on corrections than they
spend on higher education.  Other states are not far behind.
</LI>
<LI> Average cost of incarcerating a juvenile for one year is between $35,000
to $64,000.  In contrast, the current cost of Head Start's intervention program
is $4,300 per child a year, and the annual tuition cost of attending Harvard is
under $30,000 per student.    
</LI>

<LI> The combined local, state and federal budget to maintain the prison
population was $24.9 billion in 1990 and reportedly reached $31.2 billion in
1992. The entire budget for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention (OJJDP), which coordinates the Federal response to juvenile crime, is
$144 million.<I>  (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1990; &quot;As Spending Soars,
So Do the Profits,&quot; USA Today, Dec. 13, 1994).</I>
</LI></UL>
<H2>&quot;Lock Em Up&quot; Will Backfire </H2>
<P>The most recent studies demonstrate that putting young offenders in adult
prisons leads to more crime, higher prison costs, and increased violence.</P>
<UL>
<LI> One study, comparing New York and New Jersey juvenile offenders, shows
that the rearrest rate for children sentenced in juvenile court was 29% lower
than the rearrest rate for juveniles sentenced in the adult criminal court. <I>(Jeffrey
Fagan, The Comparative Advantage of Juvenile Versus Criminal Court Sanctions on
Recidivism Among Adolescent Felony Offenders 1, 21, 27 (1996) (unpublished
manuscript on file with the ACLU).</I>
</LI>

<LI> A recent Florida study compared the recidivism rate of juveniles who were

transferred to criminal court versus those who were retained in the juvenile
system, and concluded that juveniles who were transferred recidivated at a
higher rate than the non-transfer group.  Furthermore, the rate of re-offending
in the transfer group was significantly higher than the non-transfer group, as
was the likelihood that the transfer group would commit subsequent felony
offenses.<I>  (Donna M. Bishop et al., The Transfer of Juveniles to Criminal
Court: Does It Make a Difference?, 42 Crime and Delinq. 171, 183 (1996).</I></LI></UL>
<P>Incarcerating youth offenders in adult prisons also places juveniles in real
danger.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Children in adult institutions are 500% more likely to be sexually
assaulted, 200% more likely to be beaten by staff, and 50% more likely to be
attacked with a weapon than juveniles confined in a juvenile facility.  <I>(Jeffrey
Fagan et al., Youth in Prisons and Training Schools: Perceptions and
Consequences of the Treatment-Custody Dichotomy, 40 Juv. &amp; Fam. Ct. J. 1
(1989); Eisikovitz &amp; Baizerman, Doin' Time: Violent Youth in a Juvenile
Facility and in an Adult Prison, 6 J. Offender Counseling, Services &amp;
Rehabilitation 5 (1983).</I>
</LI></UL>
<P><B>Defusing the Myth of the &quot;Ticking Teenage Time Bomb</B>&quot;</P>
<P>Predictions on juvenile crime are greatly exaggerated.  While some headlines
have irresponsibly suggested that a &quot;ticking time bomb&quot; of so-called &quot;superpredator
children&quot; is waiting to explode, the studies show it is more a &quot;cyclical
time bulge.&quot;</P>
<UL>
<LI> Crime level indicators show that the male &quot;at risk&quot; population
(those ages 15-24) will rise over the next decade, but the levels are far from
an &quot;explosion.&quot;  In fact, the levels are lower than those reached in
1980, when the &quot;at risk&quot; population last peaked.<I>  (Austin &amp;
Cohen, Why are Crime Rates Declining An NCCD Briefing Report, National Council
on Crime and Delinquency, March 1994). </I>
</LI>
<LI> From 1982 to 1992, the percentage of young people arrested for violent
crimes increased by less than half of one percent. <I>(Synder &amp; Sickmund,
Juvenile Offenders and Victims: 1996 Update on Violence, OJJDP, Justice
Department (Aug. 1995)).</I>
</LI></UL>
<P>The public also holds greatly inflated perceptions about the prevalence and
severity of juvenile crime.   </P>
<UL>
<LI> Only 6% of juveniles were arrested in 1994, the majority of whom only come
 in contact with the juvenile justice system once. And the overwhelming majority
of those arrests have nothing to do with violence. <I> (Synder &amp; Sickmund,
Juvenile Offenders and Victims: A National Report, OJJDP, Justice Dept. (Aug.
1995)). </I>
</LI>
<LI> Contrary to public perception, the percentage of violent crimes committed
by juveniles is low.  According to one estimate, only 13% of violent crimes are
committed by young people.<I>  (Gallup Poll Monthly, Sept. 1994)</I>.
</LI>
<LI> A recent government survey shows that less than half of one percent of
juveniles commit the most serious violent crimes, rape and murder.  In fact
murders comprised of less than two-tenths of 1% of all juvenile arrests.  <I>(&quot;Crime
Time Bomb,&quot; U.S. News &amp; World Report, March 25, 1996; Synder &amp;
Sickmund, Juvenile Offenders and Victims: 1996 Update on Violence, OJJDP,

The <b>American Civil Liberties Union</b> urges you to contact the members of the
U.S. Senate Commerce Committee and your own Senators to ask them to oppose
the efforts to turn online communications into the most heavily censored
form of American media. 
<P>
In a clumsy effort to purge sexual expression from the Internet and other
online networks, the self-described <a href="../library/bill1.html">
"Communications Decency Act of 1995"</a>
(S.314, introduced by Senator Exon on 2/2/95) would make ALL
telecommunications service providers liable for every message, file, or
other content carried on their networks.  Senator Exon is planning to
attach the bill to Senator Pressler's new telecommunications legislation,
which is targeted for action in early March. 
<P>
The Exon proposal would severely restrict the flow of online information
by requiring service providers to act as private censors of e-mail
messages, public forums, mailing lists, and archives to avoid criminal
liability.  The ACLU believes that online users should be the only censors
of the content of the information they receive. 
<P>
The Exon proposal broadens existing law by subjecting service providers,
as well as the individuals who actually send messages, to criminal
liability for any "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" message
transmitted over their networks.  <a href="/action/action1a.html"><i>(CONT'D)</i></a>

<img src="/graphics/actionhdr.gif">
<center>
<h1>Axe The Exon Bill (cont'd)</h1></center><hr>
If enacted into law, this vague and overly broad legislation could have
the following draconian effects: 
<UL>
<li>The Exon proposal would prohibit communications with sexual
content through private e-mail between consenting adults, and would
inhibit people from making comments that might or might not be prohibited. 
<P><li>
Under the Exon proposal, service providers would pay up to
$100,000 or spend up to 2 years in jail for prohibited content produced by
subscribers on other networks, over which they had no control. 
<P><li>
The Exon proposal would expand current restrictions on telephone
access by minors to dial-a-porn services to include online access to
indecent material, requiring service providers to purge "indecent"
material from public bulletin boards and discussion groups to avoid
accidental viewing by a minor. 
<P><li>
In effect, online providers would be forced to offer to adults only that
content that is "suitable for minors." 
</uL>
<P>
S. 314 is nearly identical to an amendment Senator Exon successfully
attached to last year's Senate version of the telecommunications law
overhaul.  Last year's bill died for unrelated reasons, but the Senate
Commerce Committee is determined to pass new telecommunications
legislation this year that could easily include the Exon proposal. 
<P>
The ACLU opposes the restrictions on speech imposed by this legislation
because they violate the First Amendment's guarantee of free expression. 
Forcing carriers to pre-screen content violates the Constitution and
threatens the free and robust expression that is the promise of the Net. 
The Constitution requires that any abridgement of speech use the least
restrictive means available -- the language of the Exon proposal is
clearly the most restrictive because it sweeps broadly against a wide
array of protected material involving sexual expression. 
<P>
Stop the information superhighway from becoming the most censored segment
of communications media!

<title>Preview of 1995 Court Term</title>
<body>
<body bgcolor=#FFFFFF>

<img src="/graphics/courthdr.gif"><br>
<font size=+2>Preview of 1995 Court Term --</font>
  <font size=+1>Criminal Justice</font><br>
<font size=-1><b><i>Vivian Berger, ACLU General Counsel</i></b></font>
<p>
<b>September 27, 1995</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p> As in September 1994, the Supreme Court has surely not yet filled its docket of
     criminal, habeas and capital cases. In light of past years' trends, however, one can make some reasonable
     judgments about the subjects that interest the Court, which are likely to surface in matters granted certiorari
     when the 1995 Term opens, and about the probable disposition of some of the matters already pending. 
</p>
<p>     At this point, the Justices have agreed to hear two death penalty habeas cases; both raise significant
     questions. In Thompson v. Keohane, the Court will decide whether a state court's determination that a
     defendant was not in &quot;custody&quot; for purposes of Miranda's protections poses a legal or a factual issue. 
</p>
<p>     If upheld, the Ninth Circuit's characterization of the issue as factual would largely insulate findings on
     custody from federal review since the habeas statute accords a presumption of correctness to state court
     findings of fact in most situations. By contrast, purely legal questions and mixed questions of law and fact
     have traditionally received de novo examination in habeas. Decisions of the past decade declining to pin the
     &quot;fact&quot; label on such critical determinations as the voluntariness of a confession suggest that the Court may
     hold the line against this latest attempt to curtail federal scrutiny of state convictions. 
</p>
<p>     Lonchar v. Thomas, the other capital appeal on the docket, involves an Eleventh Circuit holding vacating a
     stay because the petitioner had engaged in abusive conduct by consistently waiting until the eleventh hour to
     seek judicial relief. The primary legal issue presented is whether a first habeas petition, as opposed to a
     subsequent filing, may be rejected for this reason. 
</p>
<p>     The prisoner's apparent mental illness complicates matters, as does the fact that he has admittedly asserted
     his claims solely in order to delay execution long enough for the legislature to consider replacing
     electrocution by lethal injection -- so that the might donate his organs after death. Lonchar's idiosyncratic
     motive may well dispose the Court against him. On the merits, however, he ought to win since no decision
     has ever blocked an initial petition on the grounds of misuse of the writ. 
</p>
<p>     Whatever the results in Thompson and Lonchar, it is fair to say that the Rehnquist Court has recently
     softened its generally implacable stance toward habeas. Last Term, for example, the justices ruled in O'Neal
     v. McAninch that a habeas court in &quot;grave doubt&quot; whether a trial error was harmless must grant the writ,
     thereby placing the burden of proof on the state to establish lack of prejudice. 
</p>
<p>     Notably, Justice Breyer's opinion elevated the role of habeas in avoiding imprisonment of the innocent over
     the usually emphasized interest in ensuring the finality of convictions. The same concern animated two other
     1994 Term decisions: Schlup v. Delo, which rejected the state's effort to create a very stringent standard of
     miscarriage of justice, sufficient to surmount procedural barriers to habeas review, and Kyles v. Whitley,
     which granted the writ in a fact-bound case where the prisoner may very well have been framed. 
</p>
<p>     Ironically, the Court is becoming more receptive to habeas just when the new Republican Congress seeks
     to cripple it once and for all. The House and Senate bills passed this spring contain provisions calling for
     very strong deference to determinations by state courts of pure or mixed questions of law. 
</p>
<p>     If enacted, such legislation would essentially moot the Thomas question since it would render unimportant
     the distinction between legal and factual issues. More significant, it would overrule Brown v. Allen (1953),
     the landmark decision which established the principle that habeas courts must independently determine and
     apply federal constitutional standards. And it would do so notwithstanding the Court's refusal, twice during
     the last three years (in Wright v. West (1992) and Withrow v. Williams (1993), to abandon Brown. 
</p>
<p>     A third case that implicates civil liberties concerns is Rutledge v. United States. It poses the question
     whether the double jeopardy clause bars entering judgments of conviction and concurrent sentences on two
     counts -- engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) and conspiring to possess with intent to
     distribute a controlled substance -- where the conduct underlying the conspiracy constitutes a necessary
     element of the CCE charge. 
</p>
<p>     Rutledge is important less in itself than as a sign that the Court has not relinquished its interest in double
     jeopardy. The last decade has produced numerous decisions in the area, some protective of defendants'
     rights and others not. 
</p>
<p>     Additional fields that have recently occupied the Court's attention include both search and seizure and mens
     rea requirements in federal crimes. Although the justices have not agreed to hear any such cases thus far,
     they are likely to do so later this Term. 
</p>
<p>     And if historical trends persist, the Fourth Amendment will continue to shrivel -- as it did last Term, when
     the Court sustained suspicionless drug tests of high-school athletes (Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton
     (1995)) and held that the exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence seized on account of a warrant that
     had been quashed and remained in the computer because of an error by court employees (Arizona v. Evans
     (1995)). By contrast, in any future decisions on criminal intent, the Court will probably reject the notion of
     strict liability -- as it has done in a number of decisions in the past few years.

<h2>What Is The Truth About Violent Crime In America?</h2>
<p>
	By Malcolm C. Young and Marc Mauer
<p>
A recent report released by the newly-formed Council on Crime in America
contends that broader use of incarceration is the solution to the problem of
violent crime.  The report, "The State of Violent Crime in America," (January
1996) purports to be a comprehensive approach to the problem by an
organization that "seeks to provide rigorous, factual information."  The
Council is co-chaired by Griffin Bell and William Bennett, and news reports
have stated that the report was written by Council member John DiIulio.
<p>
For policymakers concerned with crime policy, the report purports to offer
guidance.  Persons seriously interested in addressing this problem, though,
should consider whether the report provides the "rigorous, factual
information" it advertises.  In fact, it provides a highly selective, and at
times, deceptive use of available government data.  Following are some
examples taken from the "Ten Highlights" of the report.
<p>
"One out of four criminal victimizations in America today is violent."  True,
but nearly half of the 10.9 million violent victimizations annually are
simple assaults without injury (5.2 million), such as a barroom or schoolyard
fight.  These are problems, of course, but not the murders, rapes, and
robberies that most concern us.
<p>
"Over half of convicted violent felons are not even sentenced to prison."
 Wrong.  The Council's report itself provides documentation that demonstrates
that more than half of violent felons are sentenced to prison.  Bureau of
Justice Statistics data for 1992 (the most recent year for which data are
available) show that 60% of offenders convicted of violent offenses were
sentenced to prison and an additional 21% were sentenced to jail terms.  In
total, four out of five persons convicted of violent offenses are sentenced
to incarceration.  Those who are not tend to be those convicted of less
serious assaults; many of the people in this category, such as battered
spouses, are not violent under ordinary circumstances.
<p>
"The justice system imprisons barely one criminal for every 100 violent
crimes."  True, but misleading for reasons that are well known to the
Council's members.  Half of all violent crimes are never even reported to the
police; less than half of those that are reported result in an arrest, and
ultimately, only about 2% of the total crimes result in a conviction.  As
noted, above, a large majority of those who are convicted are incarcerated.
 Enacting harsher sentencing policies will have no impact on those who are
never apprehended or convicted.  This statistic also inadvertently points out
one problem with the Council's approach.  That is, the criminal justice
system is a reactive system that comes into play after the harm has been
done.  Preventing violence in the first place should therefore be an equally
important objective for policymakers.
<p>
"About one in three violent crimes are committed by persons 'under
supervision' in the community."  True, but misleading again.  Here's why.
 Suppose that County X has 1000 people on pretrial supervision and has 3
murders a year, one of which is committed by a pretrial defendant.
 Therefore, "one in three" murders has been committed by a pretrial defendant
but only "one in a thousand" pretrial defendants has committed a murder.
<p>
In fact, Justice Department data indicate that about 8% of probationers are
rearrested for a violent offense, as are 2% of those on pretrial release.(1)
 Any rearrests for violent offenses are cause for concern, of course, but
clearly the numbers are far less than the "one-third" figure suggests.  These
numbers point out another problem with the Council's approach:  it is easy to
look back and determine that 2% of pretrial defendants were rearrested for a
violent offense.  It is far more difficult to predict in advance which two of
one hundred defendants released will be subsequently arrested.
<p>
"Since 1974 over 90 percent of all state prisoners have been violent
offenders or recidivists."  This shorthand statement draws on statistics that
lump together Charles Manson (violent) with a check forger who was once
convicted of a juvenile joyriding (recidivist).  Overall, 38% of those in
prison have never been convicted of a violent offense, and more than half of
inmates are serving time for a nonviolent property or drug offense.  Further,
the proportion of violent offenders in prison has been declining in the past
decade due to a surge of inmates incarcerated for drug offenses.
<p>
"The average quantity of drugs involved in federal cocaine trafficking cases
is 183 pounds."  A first semester statistics student would know that a few
major drug kingpins importing planeloads of drugs will greatly distort the
"average" quantity of drugs involved in overall drug trafficking cases.  In
fact, Justice Department data show that the median (mid-range) amount of
drugs involved in cocaine trafficking was less than 2% of the average.  A
1994 Justice Department report also concluded that one-third of federal drug
offenders were "low-level" offenders.  Further, federal prosecutors generally
select higher level drug offenses for prosecution, and let state prosecutors
handle lower level offenses.  Therefore, state inmates incarcerated for drug
offenses are likely to include significant numbers of low-level offenders as
well.
<p>
"Most violent prisoners serve less than half their time in prison before
being released."  Members of the Council, all of whom have extensive criminal
justice experience, know that judges impose sentences based on their
calculations of how much time a person will serve in prison.  If a given
state releases most inmates at half their maximum sentence, then a judge will
impose a ten-year sentence if he or she thinks the inmate should serve five
years.  There is nothing deceptive about this.  In fact, parole has long been
recognized as the most important positive reward that prison wardens can hold
out for good behavior.
<p>
Perhaps the most disingenuous aspect of this report is its failure to
acknowledge that criminal justice professionals -- judges, prosecutors,
parole officials, and others -- are making decisions every day regarding
community safety.  While human judgement is not infallible, these officials
are using the information and resources at hand to attempt to provide justice
and contribute to community safety.
<p>
Responsible officials and policymakers understand that criminal justice
policy should be based on accurate data and analysis.  Ideologues are more
easily satisfied with misrepresentative displays of admittedly complex data.
 Unfortunately, the Council on Crime in America has published a report that
will serve the interests of ideologues more than it will policymakers.
<p>      
FOOTNOTE
<p>
No national data exist for parolees, although a Justice Department study found that 22% of released prisoners were
arrested for a violent offense (generally assault) within three years of
release.  Since some of these offenders had completed parole supervision, the
proportion of parolees arrested for a violent offense is less than the 22%
figure.  The same study also found that increasing the time served in prison
by offenders did not generally lead to reductions in recidivism.

<P><I>by Ira Glasser, ACLU Executive Director</I></P>
<P>August 11, 1996</P>
<H2>Memo to Congress: The Constitution Will Still be Standing When You Return</H2>
<P>As those of you who have read my last column know, &quot;Visions of Liberty&quot;
went on a brief hiatus in July while I was on vacation.  But as I said in that
column, you can't take a vacation from the fight for freedom.  </P>
<P>That's a point I always make to the ACLU national staff in my annual
vacation memo that's become something of a tradition. In it, I tell them,
half-jokingly, &quot;If the Constitution's not standing when I get back, I'll
know who to blame.&quot;  </P>
<P>But what Congress has wrought in the days before breaking for its own summer
recess is no joke: the House passed the Defense of Marriage Act, which would
deny recognition of marriages between same-sex couples; and English-Only
legislation that will legitimize and encourage discrimination against Americans
not fluent in English; both Houses signed off on a health care bill that
includes provisions destructive of our medical privacy.  There was also a bill,
which for the moment we defeated, that would have expanded the already

unprecedented scope of federal wiretapping authority.  (We expect a revival of
the wiretapping legislation when Congress gets back to business as usual after
Labor Day.)  </P>
<P>Who, indeed, is to blame for all this unconstitutional,  unprincipled
legislation?  Some of it is old-fashioned special- interest politics.  The
medical privacy legislation, for example, was passed without much public
awareness and in effect catered to the interests of companies who make money by
buying and selling personal information.  But most of the legislation violating
important civil liberties principles reflected election-year politics, the
frenzied and unprincipled attempt by politicians to pander to the fears,
resentments and prejudices of the majority.</P>
<P>James Madison, one of the fathers of the Bill of Rights, recognized this
special danger to liberty.  In a democracy, he argued, the ultimate source of
power lies with the majority of the people.  Therefore, the invasion of
individual rights, he thought, was likely to come not from a legislature that
was out of step with its constituents, but from a legislature acting in accord
with the majority.  </P>
<P>Madison was a skeptic, and with good reason.  He had seen &quot;overbearing
majorities&quot; in every state violate their own state bills of rights.  In his
home state of Virginia, he saw the Virginia Declaration of Rights &quot;violated
in every instance where it has been opposed to a popular current.&quot; </P>
<P>In fact, initially Madison didn't have much faith in the Bill of Rights to
restrain the tyranny of a majority in a democracy, and for that reason was not
in favor of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution.  It was Thomas
Jefferson, writing from Paris, who convinced Madison with this argument: once
established, a bill of rights would provide the legal basis for an independent
judiciary to strike down majoritarian excesses by ruling unconstitutional any
legislative or executive act that violated individual rights as defined in the
Constitution.</P>
<P>Madison came to understand that, if enforced by the courts,  the Bill of
Rights would be more than a &quot;parchment barrier;&quot; it would become an &quot;impenetrable
bulwark&quot; against every assumption of unconstitutional power by either
Congress or the President, even if committed in response to majority opinion.  
</P>
<P>So why, you might ask, is the ACLU fighting so hard against these myriad
unconstitutional proposals when we have this impenetrable bulwark to keep the
government from violating our rights?  Why not just go to court?  </P>
<P>Well, we do.  Last spring, for example, after Congress passed and the
President signed a law imposing censorship on the Internet, we went into court
and got the law struck down.  But that doesn't always work.  Too often, when
constitutional rights are at stake, the courts reflect popular sentiments
instead of curbing them: in 1857, for example, slavery was held by the U.S.
Supreme Court to be constitutionally acceptable.  Similar examples are plentiful
throughout our history.  </P>
<P>The fact is, once laws that violate civil liberties are in place, it can be
extraordinarily difficult and sometimes impossible to persuade a court to strike
them down.  Jefferson was right in principle, but Madison turns out to have been
prescient: too often the Bill of Rights has proved to be merely a parchment
barrier.  During moments of frenzy or fear, it is not hard for politicians to
manipulate citizens.</P>
<P>The continuing push for expanded federal wiretapping is one example of how
constitutional principles can get washed away in a &quot;popular current.&quot; 
Spurred by the recent tragedies of the TWA Flight 800 explosion and the bombing
at the Atlanta Olympics, President Clinton quickly revived legislation, rejected
by Congress earlier this year, calling for expansion of the FBI's wiretapping
authority. </P>
<P>Hard to go against public sentiment on that one, right?  Who in his right
mind would speak out against this law if it will help catch terrorists? </P>
<P>The problem is, this law won't do anything more to help us catch terrorists,
but will do a lot to make innocent people less free.</P>
<P>The FBI already has all the authority it needs to investigate these heinous
crimes.  Current law allows the FBI to obtain wiretaps for a host of crimes,
including arson, bombs, nuclear weapons, assassinations, hostage-taking, and
other crimes that place people in danger of death or physical injury.  If these
acts don't constitute terrorism, what does?</P>
<P>Moreover, for crimes that threaten national security or place people in
imminent physical danger, the FBI is allowed to wiretap for 48 hours without a
warrant.  And they can even obtain court orders to allow them to tap multiple
phones not belonging to the suspect if they can show that the suspect is
probably using the phones to avoid the tap.  These are called &quot;roving
wiretaps&quot; and they are especially dangerous because they target phones
primarily used by innocent people.  That is why the FBI is required under
current law to obtain a warrant for these kinds of taps.  And courts virtually
never deny warrants.  Since 1988, no application for a criminal wiretapping
warrant has been denied.  What more does the FBI want or need?    </P>
<P>What the FBI wanted -- and what the proposed legislation would have given
them -- was the expanded discretion to place these dangerous roving wiretaps
without having to convince a court that they were necessary to prevent a suspect
from thwarting the tap.  </P>
<P>Requiring exacting court scrutiny, as the current law does, is important in
light of the FBI's sorry history of illegitimately tapping innocent people.  But
bombs have exploded and people have been killed.  We are all fearful, and the
FBI, pandering to those fears, saw its chance to dilute the scope of court
supervision over its wiretapping authority.</P>
<P>The irony is that wiretapping isn't very effective against random terrorist
acts.  In fact, the government doesn't use it much.  Out of 9,553 electronic
surveillance applications filed by federal and state authorities in the past ten
years, only 19 -- less than 0.02% -- were for arson, bombing or firearms. 
Seventy percent of all wiretaps are for narcotics investigations and another 18
percent are for illegal gambling and racketeering.   The protection of liberty
-- always vulnerable -- requires something more than faith in the decent
intentions and benevolent instincts of public officials or a concerned majority.
 In the words of the historian Leonard Levy, liberty requires that &quot;the
state must be bitted and bridled by a Bill of Rights...its protections not to be
the playthings of momentary majorities or of those in power.&quot;</P>
<P>So, I've got another memo I'm thinking about right now, a memo to the
members of the 104th Congress: The Constitution will still be standing when you
return.  And the ACLU will still be standing behind it. </P>

<H2>No Vacation for Civil Liberties</H2><IMG
SRC="/graphics/lib.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" WIDTH="318" HEIGHT="227">
<P>The summer of 1996 may be the brightest yet for the lesbian and gay rights
movement, and for women as well.  In May, a 6-3 majority of the Supreme Court
invalidated Amendment 2, a ballot measure that would have prohibited all legal
protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation.  And this week
the Supreme Court voted 7-1 to overturn the Virginia Military Institute's policy
of excluding all women, declaring that Virginia's daughters must be served as
well as her sons.  	</P>
<P>With these two historic decisions, it may seem safe to entrust our rights to
the Supreme Court.  Maybe now all those people out there fighting for justice
can just turn off their phones and fax machines, put away their protest banners,
and enjoy a well-deserved vacation.  I, for one, will be away from the office
for a little while, putting this column on a brief hiatus.  But the ACLU office
will keep humming.  After all, you  can't take a vacation from the fight for
freedom. 	 	</P>
<P>As any student of American history will tell you, the Supreme Court has
rarely been in the vanguard of protecting our civil liberties.  Indeed, for most
of its history, instead of challenging prevailing stereotypes, the Supreme Court
relied on them to uphold restrictions on people's rights.    	</P>
<P>The 1857 Dred Scott decision was a tragic case in point.  Six Justices used
the case brought by Scott, a freed slave from Missouri, to uphold the
constitutionality of Southern slavery and advance the notion that blacks were
inferior.  	</P>
<P>In language that offends our contemporary sensibilities, Chief Justice Roger
Taney wrote that blacks are &quot;a subordinate and inferior class of beings&quot;
who were &quot;unfit to associate with the white race.&quot;  The Constitution
not only provided no relief, according to Taney, it permanently excluded blacks
from national citizenship and established them legally as less than human. 
Blacks therefore had &quot;no rights which the white man was bound to respect.&quot;
    	</P>
<P>It would take a bloody Civil War to put African Americans on the road to
full equality.  But even after the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments were adopted
in the period immediately following the war, legally ending slavery and
guaranteeing equal rights, the nation soon entered into a 100-year reign of
terror against black Americans with the full support and complicity of the
Supreme Court.  	</P>
<P>In the end, it was the civil-rights movement itself that forced the Court
and other institutions of power to apply the Bill of Rights equally.  Only after
years of boycotts, picket lines, demonstrations, and only after thousands of
beatings, arrests and jailings, did the Supreme Court do its duty and begin to
fulfill its obligations under the Constitution.  	</P>
<P>Women's rights, at first, fared just as badly.  In 1873, for example, the
Court denied an Illinois woman, Myra Bradwell, a license to practice law. Women
were not suited to practice law, the Court said.  Again, the language is
astonishing by today's standards: &quot;Man is, or should be, woman's protector
and defender,&quot; wrote Justice Joseph Bradley.  A woman's &quot;natural and
proper timidity and delicacy&quot; makes her unfit for civil life, he added in
denying her entrance into the bar.  (Sounds a lot like the arguments the
Virginia Military Institute made against admitting women!)  	</P>
<P>Then, in 1971, nearly a century later, the Supreme Court dramatically
departed from its unbroken tradition of upholding sex distinctions in the law. 
An Idaho law gave men preference over women in deciding who should be the
administrator of an estate.  Sally Reed, represented by Ruth Bader Ginsberg, now
a Justice of the Supreme Court but then the Director of the ACLU's brand-new 
Women's Rights Project, challenged the law and the Court struck it down --
unanimously.  But this came after much struggle, and more than 50 years after
women won the right to vote.  And it came in the midst of a new feminist
movement that challenged the most entrenched stereotypes about women's &quot;proper&quot;
role in American society.  	</P>
<P>History serves as a painful reminder for those of us fighting for gay
rights, or women's rights, or any kind of civil rights, who might now be tempted
to rest on our laurels and rely on the Supreme Court to decide fairly the
struggles brought to its door.   Remember that only 10 years ago, in its very
first gay rights ruling, the Court upheld Georgia's sodomy statute in a decision
that relied on the &quot;ancient roots&quot; of &quot;Judeo-Christian moral and
ethical standards&quot; to justify the government's place in our bedrooms.  That
decision has never been overruled.  And in the past several years, the Court has
retreated from its commitment to equality for black Americans by rendering
decisions in the areas of voting rights and affirmative action that turn back 
the clock.  	</P>
<P>It is always profoundly gratifying when decisions like Amendment 2 or VMI
let a little more light, a little more liberty, into our lives. But history has
taught us, perhaps too well, that we cannot depend on the nine Justices alone to
safeguard our constitutional rights.      	</P>
<P>This Supreme Court term will be winding up in the next day or so.  But the
struggle for civil liberties will continue.  I'll be back in this space next
month with more from the frontlines.

<P><I>by Ira Glasser, ACLU Executive Director</I></P>
<P>August 18, 1996</P>
<H2>Election Year Politics</H2><IMG SRC="/graphics/vis818.gif">
<P>A few days ago, a friend and devoted supporter of civil liberties asked me
why he should make an extra contribution to the ACLU now when it seems more
important to contribute to the electoral defeat of zealous opponents of civil
liberties, like Senator Jesse Helms.</P>
<P>Indeed, he added, after watching the Republican convention, he was persuaded
that nothing would protect civil liberties more than defeating Bob Dole.  So he
was inclined to contribute his money toward that end, rather than give it to the
ACLU.</P>
<P>Well, I watched the Republican convention, too.  More importantly, I read
the Republican platform.  It was a nightmare for civil liberties.  It favored a
constitutional amendment that would destroy religious liberty by allowing the
government to impose someone else's prayers on your children.  It favored a
constitutional amendment to take away the guarantee of citizenship for children
born in this country to parents here on temporary visas or whose visas had
expired or who had entered without visas.  It favored a constitutional amendment
 to allow the government to imprison people for using the American flag to
express dissent.  And it favored yet another constitutional amendment to outlaw
abortions under all circumstances, including rape and incest.  It also expressed
enduring hostility to civil rights for gay men and lesbians.  And it opposed all
affirmative action remedies for racial and gender discrimination.  Not a pretty
picture.</P>
<P>But the Democrats are no civil liberties bargain, either.  Clinton has sold
out the rights of needy children by his willingness to sign a welfare bill
reminiscent of the English Poor Laws at the dawn of industrialization.  Then, as
now, structural changes in the economy left many without jobs.  Then, as now,
government decided to force the unemployed to work by making their lives and
their children's lives as wretched as possible, in the vain hope that they would
then have no choice but to work.  But there weren't enough jobs, and the only
result was an unprecedented increase in sustained misery.  The same result is
likely now.</P>
<P>Clinton has also supported expanded wiretapping, the erosion of federal
courts' authority to review the constitutionality of state trials, the expansion
of the death penalty, and curfew laws that would make being a young a crime even
if teenagers were out at a concert with their parents' permission.</P>
<P>Clinton also signed a law subsequently ruled unconstitutional by a
three-judge federal court, that imposed broad censorship on the Internet, with
heavy criminal penalties for posting material on the net that would be perfectly
legal to print in a book, newspaper or magazine.  When asked by an ACLU staff 
member why the Clinton Administration was being so hostile to civil liberties, a
presidential adviser admitted it was &quot;good politics.&quot;</P>
<P>So, this is what we face:  a Republican party that has been captured by
religious zealots and the forces of intolerance and a Democratic president who
seems only too willing to abandon civil liberties principles in order to get
elected.</P>
<P>As a result, civil liberties are caught in a political crossfire.  The plain
truth is that many of our most fundamental freedoms will continue to be in
danger no matter how the elections come out in November because both parties are
locked in a competition to see who can sacrifice more liberties.</P>
<P>None of this is especially new.  The people who founded this country and
wrote the Bill of rights knew that even in a democracy liberty would be 
threatened by momentary passions, misguided fears and the readiness of
politicians to pander to these forces.  That is why they created a legal system
to bridle majoritarian excesses.</P>
<P>But the legal system our founders created depends on citizens willing to
stand of for their rights -- no matter which party is in office -- and it
requires organizations to support these citizens when they do stand up -- to
represent them in court and to fight for them in Congress and in the forums of
public opinion.</P>
<P>For 76 years, the ACLU has been doing that.  We never support or oppose any
electoral candidate because we know that no matter who is in office, we will
sooner or later have to sue them to enforce the Bill of Rights.  That doesn't
mean one candidate wouldn't be better for civil liberties than another.  It
means that the outcome of the struggle to defend the Bill of Rights for all
Americans depends more on citizens and on organizations like the ACLU than on
elected officials.</P>
<P>Denizens of the Internet know this because a few months ago, a
Republican-controlled Congress passed a law censoring the Internet and a
Democratic president signed it.  When it comes to protecting freedom of speech
in this new medium, neither party proved reliable.  Instead, the censorship law
was struck down by citizens who stepped forward to resist it and by the ACLU,
which represented those citizens.</P>
<P>And that's why I told my friend to support the candidate of his choice but
to continue supporting the ACLU as well -- especially in an election year when
politicians have a tendency to sacrifice any liberty if they think it will help
them get elected.</P>
<P>As our entire history demonstrates, liberty depends not on those who oppose
it or sell it out when it becomes inconvenient, but on those willing to fight
for it and provide support for those who defend it.</P>

<TITLE> The ACLU on Abortion Clinics </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>
<blockquote>
<img src="/graphics/libraryhdr.gif">
<CENTER><H1>Abortion Clinic Access Law</H1></CENTER>
<P>
        <EM> <CENTER>"Doesn't the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act<BR>
            infringe upon free speech and religious freedom?"</CENTER></EM>
<P>
<STRONG>BACKGROUND</STRONG>
<br>
The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or FACE, was signed into
law by President Clinton on May 26, 1994. It was intended to stem the
well-documented and increasing violence against those who obtain and
provide abortions. The law provides criminal and civil penalities against
the use of force, threats of force, physical obstruction or property
damage aimed at interfering with those obtaining or providing reproductive
health services. 
<P>
On the same day the law was signed, various anti-choice groups filed suit
in federal courts in Virginia, Arizona and the District of Columbia to
block enforcement of the law on the grounds that, as written, it infringed
First Amendment and statutory rights to freedom of speech and of religion. 
<P>
The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia was the first
to render an opinion. On June 16, the District Court dismissed the case,
concluding that Congress had the constitutional authority to enact FACE
and that the law as drafted infringed no First Amendment freedoms. An
appeal is expected. 
<P>
Additional legal challenges to the constitutionality of FACE are expected
throughout 1994. 
<P>
Following the first three lawsuits, cases were filed in federal courts in
California, Florida, Virginia (a second case in that state) and Louisiana.
In addition, the first criminal complaint against an anti-abortion
blockader under the statute has been filed by the U.S. Attorney in
Milwaukee. 
<P>
Having worked during the legislative process to assure that First
Amendment rights were not infringed by the Act, the ACLU believes the new
law, as it is written, does not violate the First Amendment. Wherever
feasible, we will file friend-of-the-court briefs supporting the
constitutionality of the law. 
<P>
<STRONG>IN BRIEF</STRONG>
<br>
<UL>
<LI>As the nation's preeminent defender of the Constitution and the Bill of
Rights, the ACLU ardently defends the right of all -- including
anti-abortion activists -- to communicate their message by speaking,
praying, chanting, singing and demonstrating. The ACLU has worked to make
sure FACE protects the First Amendment rights of protesters. We have also
defended anti-abortion activists from police abuse. 
<P>
<LI>What the First Amendment does not protect is criminal acts of violence
-- shooting doctors, kidnapping clinic staff, spraying butyric acid on
clinic property, destroying medical equipment or making death threats. The
Constitution does not -- and never has -- provided immunity to vigilantes. 
<P>
<LI>Blockades -- physical obstruction that interferes with another person's
rights -- are not protected by the First Amendment, even when used as a
tactic of political protest. A protester is protected when she sets up a
table on a sidewalk and offers literature or distributes leaflets from the
middle of a sidewalk. But the First Amendment does not protect a group of
people when they link arms and prevent others from passing on the sidewalk
or from entering or exiting a building. 
<P>
<LI>The claim that FACE discriminates on the basis of content or viewpoint
is groundless. This charge simply does not apply when violence and
physical obstruction, as opposed to expression, are the targets of the
restriction. 
<P>
<LI>It does not matter whether those who violate the Act are motivated by
religious belief or secular objection to abortion; intentional violent or
obstructive interference is simply forbidden. FACE does not single out any
religion or religious belief for discrimination. 
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>ACLU POLICY</STRONG>
<br>
Protection of the First Amendment is part of the ACLU's "common law." 
Likewise, the ACLU has supported a woman's right to choose abortion since
before Roe v. Wade, and in recent years has argued the key cases opposing
restrictions that deny women access to reproductive health care. Policy
263 states: "The ACLU holds that every woman, as a matter of her right to
the enjoyment of life, liberty, and privacy, should be free to determine
whether and when to bear children." 
<P>
The ACLU has long distinguished between violence and non-violent protest.
Policy 41 (section b) on picketing is illustrative: "Picketing is an
expression of the rights of free speech and assembly protected by the
First Amendment. The ACLU supports the right to picket in any
circumstances, by any method, in any numbers. Neither the merits of the
controversy nor the views expressed limit the right to picket. The right
to picket does not, however, protect acts of violence, or the physical
obstruction of persons and places." 
<P>
<STRONG>ARGUMENTS, FACTS, QUOTES</STRONG>
<br>
Congress has a dual obligation to protect women exercising their
constitutional right to choose abortion and the medical providers who
assist them, as well as to protect the First Amendment rights of
anti-abortion activists.  The new federal law, patterned after existing
civil rights legislation, fulfills that dual obligation. It provides
urgently needed protection for the constitutional rights of abortion
clinic patients and providers, while still permitting protesters to
express their views peacefully as guaranteed by the First Amendment. 
<P>
FACE is aimed at punishing illegal conduct. From 1977 through April of
1993, reproductive health clinics and providers were the targets of an
escalating epidemic of violence, with 36 bombings, 81 arsons, 84 assaults,
two kidnappings, 327 clinic invasions and one murder. These are not
activities protected by the First Amendment. 
<P>
The law punishes:  [whoever] by force or threat of force or by physical
obstruction, intentionally injures, intimidates or interferes with or
attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person .... obtaining
or providing reproductive health services .... 
<P>
From the outset, the ACLU vigorously scrutinized the bill and worked
with members of Congress to avoid infringement of expression protected by
the First Amendment.  The Act explicitly states: 
<P>
<dl>
<dd><EM>Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any expressive
conduct (including peaceful picketing or other peaceful demonstration)
protected from legal prohibition by the First Amendment to the
Constitution. </EM></dl>
<P>
Long-standing First Amendment law distinguishes between aggressive
expression, on the one hand, and behavior that prevents others from
exercising their rights, on the other. Anti-abortion activists, like all
citizens espousing any cause, are properly protected by the First
Amendment when they speak, march, demonstrate, pray or associate with
others in these activities. Their expression may be harsh, vigorous,
unsettling, and unpleasant and still be protected by the First Amendment. 
But protesters may not physically obstruct others from exercising their
rights, nor break the bounds of peaceful expression and assembly. 
<P>
Because FACE does not penalize expressive activities, claims of content
or viewpoint discrimination fail.  Just as Congress was free during the
civil rights struggles of the 1960s to provide special protection for
polling places, voters, and those assisting others to exercise their right
to vote, Congress is free now to respond to violence at reproductive
health facilities by protecting these facilities, their staffs and their
patients. 
<P>
Finally, guarantees of religious freedom are not shields for violence
against or physical obstruction of those exercising protected rights. FACE
does not target any religious practice or belief for discrimination; it
punishes violations of its terms regardless of whether the perpetrators
are motivated by religious belief or secular dogma. 
<P>
Because all laws are susceptible to overreach by police or prosecutors,
however, the ACLU plans to carefully monitor enforcement of the law. 
Should local authorities misinterpret the statute and apply it improperly,
the ACLU will act to protect the constitutional rights of anti-abortion
protesters. 
<P>

<TITLE> The ACLU on Violence Chip </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>

<img src="/graphics/libraryhdr.gif">
<CENTER><H1>Violence Chip</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><EM>"Why Does the ACLU Oppose the V-Chip Legislation<BR> 
Currently Pending In Congress?"</EM></CENTER>

<STRONG>BACKGROUND</STRONG><BR>
Culminating a protracted campaign against TV violence, both Houses of
Congress have passed legislation requiring that new televisions be equipped
with the so-called v-chip -- a computerized chip capable of detecting program
ratings and blocking adversely rated programs from view.  The v-chip
provisions appear in each House's version of the telecommunications bill. The
Senate bill orders the television industry to "voluntarily" establish within
one year a rating system for violence and "other objectionable content."  If
the industry fails to comply, the legislation authorizes the President to
appoint a  federal ratings agency.  The House version would establish a
government advisory committee to set guidelines for the rating of
"programming that contains sexual, violent, or other indecent material about
which parents should be informed before it is displayed to children." 
 <P>
The legislation is now headed for conference committee to resolve differences
in the House and Senate bills. The ACLU will actively lobby against its
passage.
<P>
<STRONG>IN BRIEF</STRONG>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> A media ratings system mandated by the government under threat of the
formation of a federal rating agency should private industry fail is not a
"voluntary" system.  It is a form of censorship clearly forbidden by the
First Amendment.  
<P>
<LI> The courts have repeatedly held that depictions of violence in books and
films are protected by the First Amendment from government regulation or
restriction.  The government may not even prohibit speech that advocates the
use of force or violence unless it is intended to incite or produce such
action and is likely to do so.  
<P>
<LI>Although its supporters claim the v-chip gives parents control over their
children's viewing habits, in fact it will function as a governmental
usurpation of parental control.  Under the legislation, it is the government
(either directly or by coercing private industry), and not the parents, that
will determine how programs will be rated.  If a parent activates the v-chip,
all programs with a "violent" rating will be blocked.  What kind of violence
will be censored?  Football games?  War movies?  News reports?  
<P>
<LI> Various devices that enable parents to control their children's TV watching
without any government involvement or interference are already on the market.
These include a channel  "lockbox" for cable TV, built-in channel guards that
allow parents to block certain channels for specified periods of time, and
new products such as The TeleCommander and the TV Guardian that allow parents
to choose what their children will be able to watch on TV.  The v-chip is
therefore unnecessary.
</ul>
<STRONG>ACLU POLICY</STRONG><BR>
Protection of the rights enshrined in the First Amendment is part of the
ACLU's "common law."  The organization has historically opposed laws or
practices that restrict, in any way, freedom of the press and freedom of
expression.  This includes media depictions of violence.
<P>
<STRONG>ARGUMENTS, FACTS, QUOTES</STRONG><BR>
TV violence has been blamed for various social ills since 1952, when
Congress held its first hearings on the subject.  Four decades and many
studies later, a causal relationship between exposure to violent imagery and
violent behavior has still not been proven.  In 1972, the Surgeon General
issued a report on Television and Social Behavior.  The report noted only a
"preliminary and tentative indication" of a causal relation and said:
<P>
  "The effect is small compared with many other possible causes, such as
parental attitudes or knowledge of and experience with the real violence of
our society...evidence does not warrant the conclusion that televised
violence has a uniformly adverse effect...or an adverse effect on the
majority of children."
<P>
Subsequent research findings are just as "tentative," and distract attention
from the real causes of crime and violence:  poverty, inadequate educational
and job opportunities, domestic abuse.
<P>
Although the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the TV violence issue, its
1968 decision in Interstate Circuit v. Dallas is relevant.  In that decision
the Court struck down as unconstitutionally vague an ordinance authorizing
the classification of certain films as "not suitable for young persons" where
the standard was defined as:  "describing or portraying brutality, criminal
violence or depravity in such a manner as to...incite or encourage crime or
delinquency on the part of young persons."  Other federal courts have ruled
that laws regulating "excessive violence" on TV are unconstitutionally vague
because they fail to put anyone on notice of what exactly is banned.
<P>
A uniform TV rating system is unworkable.  In some major markets, viewers
will soon be able to choose from 100 different channels, representing about
2,400 hours of programming each day.  Both telecommunication bills give
private industry one year to come with a "voluntary" rating system, but given
the massive volume of programs and the fact that TV offerings constantly
change, it is unlikely the industry would be able to meet the deadline.  A
huge government bureaucracy with the power to preview, rate and block TV
programs will be the inevitable result of the v-chip legislation.

<P>September 1, 1996</P>
<H2>Translating Liberties: Letter from Russia</H2>
<P>The ACLU normally doesn't become involved in civil liberties cases abroad,
unless an American citizen or the U.S. government is involved.  But on a recent
trip to Russia to attend a human rights meeting there, I learned of a case that
should be of interest to the entire community of people concerned about
fundamental rights.</P>
<P>I was in Russia -- St. Petersburg, to be specific -- to help evaluate a
project of a civil liberties group there called Citizens Watch.  The project
included the publication, in Russian, of ACLU handbooks on various rights.  We
had agreed to be the American partner in the project, and the first publication
they undertook was to translate and publish the ACLU's &quot;Your Right to
Government Information.&quot;  It was strange to see our handbook in the
Cyrillic alphabet, but thrilling to know that our efforts here were being used
there as a model.  </P>
<P>In any event, while sitting in the offices of Citizens Watch shortly after I
arrived, still groggy from crossing several time zones without much sleep, their
fax machine began to whir and out of it came a bulletin about their latest case.
 </P>
<P>The case involves a retired Russian naval officer named Alexander Nikitin,
who contracted with the Bellona Foundation, a Norwegian environmental group, to
prepare a public report on the potential hazard posed by Russian radioactive
waste dumping at sea.</P>
<P>There was nothing secret about this work.  Nikitin worked openly, and he
utilized material previously published and available.  The report itself was
prepared by the Bellona Foundation for a meeting in Moscow last April; and the
text of the report was published in three languages and posted on the Internet. 
It has now led to a joint project between Russia and Norway on utilizing nuclear
waste.</P>
<P>Despite this completely open process, Nikitin has been charged with treason
by the Russian government and imprisoned without a trial since early February. 
According to his wife, who saw him on August 21st, his health and physical
condition has badly deteriorated in recent weeks, indicating mistreatment or at
least negligence with respect to the conditions of his detention.</P>
<P>The pre-trial detention itself has now been extended until October 8th,
which would be eight months after Nikitin was arrested.</P>
<P>The case against Nikitin seems utterly without any foundation.  The treason
charge is based on an accusation that he gave the Bellona Foundation secret data
on the dumping of Russian radioactive waste at sea, yet the practice had
previously been detailed in a publicly available report by President Boris
Yeltsin's own ecological adviser.  Both Nikitin and the Bellona Foundation
insist that all the information provided in the report was taken from publicly
available sources.  Furthermore, all the information in the report is strictly
related to environmental conditions and threats to human life and health.  Such
information cannot be classified as secret under Article 7 of the Russian Law on
State Secrets.</P>
<P>The role of the Federal Security Bureau (FSB) in this case is especially
ominous.  The FSB is the successor agency to the old Soviet KGB, the secret
police which for decades functioned as an engine of political repression in a

lawless state.</P>
<P>The FSB subjected Nikitin to surveillance from the first days of his work
with the Bellona Foundation.  They therefore had every opportunity to impede the
delivery of information to Bellona if their purpose was to prevent the
transmission of legitimate state secrets.  Instead, they permitted the delivery
of the draft report and then embarked upon creating a fabricated espionage case.</P>
<P>The charge against Nikitin is based on an investigation by military experts
appointed by the prosecutor.  They concluded that six of the eight chapters of
the Bellona report contained state secrets.  But they conceded that they had
failed to investigate whether the so-called secrets had in fact been derived
from publicly available sources.  Nikitin's lawyer, Yuri Schmidt, in applying
for a re-examination of this question, attached copies of previously published
articles and books upon which Nikitin relied.  The investigatory authorities
were forced to concede that their initial conclusion, classifying the data used
in the report as secret, was hardly correct.  But the second investigation has
been similarly unresponsive to the question of public sources, and meanwhile
Nikitin remains in prison.</P>
<P>Procedurally, Nikitin's rights have been grossly violated.  He was initially
refused counsel of his choice and instead assigned a lawyer employed by the
policy agency that arrested him.  The lawyer of his choice was denied security
clearance and then asked to submit to wiretaps and mail surveillance as a
condition of representing Nikitin.  Eventually, this was overturned by Russia's
new Constitutional Court, but in the meantime the defendant was effectively
excluded from the legal proceedings.  The two-month extension of Nikitin's
pre-trial detention was granted on August 6th, ostensibly to allow more time to
reinvestigate the question of whether he relied solely upon public sources.  But
as of August 18th, no investigative acts involving Nikitin have taken place. 
And the appeal of his extended detention, required by Russian law to be
considered by the court within four days, has gone unaddressed for over two
weeks.</P>
<P>Substantively, Nikitin appears to have been arrested and detained without
trial for perfectly legal activities.  According to Boris Pustintsev, a longtime
human rights activist in St. Petersburg, if Nikitin is convicted, &quot;any
Russian citizen collaborating in any way with a foreign organization or company
could find himself in danger.&quot;  This case, Pustintsev believes, &quot;brings
us back to the totalitarian Soviet times.&quot;</P>
<P>Russia has a new Constitution, he says, which is not being enforced, and has
joined the Council of Europe and signed all existing international agreements on
human rights, which are in this case being ignored.  He believes that the
pressure of international public opinion can make a difference.</P>
<P>So does Amnesty International, which has called for Nikitin's immediate
release and urged all human rights activists to make their views known to
Russian officials.  For further information about where and to whom to write,
you can e-mail Amnesty International, United States Section at
<A HREF="mailto:admin-us@aiusa.usa.com">admin-us@aiusa.usa.com</A> or visit
their main web page at <A HREF="http://www.amnesty.org/">www.amnesty.org</A>.</P>
<P>The case itself illustrates the problems civil liberties advocates face in a
place like Russia.  There are no traditions of governance through law, no
traditions of independent courts enforcing laws against government excess, no
traditions of organizations outside of government acting as a restraint on
government.  There are few journalists who are familiar with the law or whose
beat includes the world of law.  And citizens generally are unaware of what
their rights are, of how to enforce their rights, or of what their rights could
be. </P>
<P>In a situation like this, organizations like the ACLU act not only as a
source of information but also as a beacon of hope and possibility to the
relative handful of heroes who struggle with few resources and at significant
personal risk to bring fundamental rights to their country.  </P>

<P>The outcome of the Nikitin case may well become a pivotal moment in that
ongoing struggle.  Certainly, that is how the activists I met in St. Petersburg
felt.</P>

<p>During the ending days of the 104th Congress, both the House and Senate passed legislation that would ban so-called &quotpartial-birth abortions,&quot but President Clinton, listening to the experiences of women from around the country, vetoed the measure and an override attempt failed in the Senate.

<img src = "/graphics/redstar.gif">While nearly 90 percent of all abortions take place in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy, D&X is one of the safest methods available to preserve a woman's life, health and fertility of those women who need abortions later in pregnancy.

<img src = "/graphics/redstar.gif">Many of these women who need D&X make heart-wrenching decisions to end their pregnancies because of health risks to themselves or because of  fetal anomalies, some so serious that the fetus has no chance to survive outside of the womb.  Other women who have abortions after the first twelve weeks tend to be poor or young or both.  Their abortions are often delayed by funding bans or other legal barriers enacted by the same abortion opponents who are now callously trying to ban a safe, medically necessary procedure.    



<p>

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE HOUSE TERRORISM BILL, H.R. 2768
</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote><img src="/graphics/legishdr.gif">
<p>	
<b>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE HOUSE TERRORISM BILL, H.R. 2768</b>
<p>
February 9, 1996  
<p>
This is an Executive Summary of the ACLU's objections to H.R. 2768, the "Effective Death Penalty Antiterrorism Act of 1995."  The House Judiciary Committee approved a similar bill on June 20 despite bi-partisan opposition from four Republicans and eight Democrats: Bob Barr (R-GA), Steve Chabot (R-OH), Bob Inglis (R-SC), F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr. (R-WI), Xavier Becerra (D-CA), John Bryant (D-TX), John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), Robert Scott (D-VA), Patricia Schroeder (D-CO), Jose Serrano (D-NY), and Melvin Watt (D-NC).  H.R. 2768 represents an agreement, following the Judiciary Committees  vote,  between Bob Barr and Henry Hyde.  It  is scheduled to be considered by the full House of Representatives on March 11.  The ACLU urges members of the House to oppose the bill for reasons stated below:
<p>
In Brief:  H.R. 2768 will ultimately have its greatest impact on American citizens who will suffer grave invasions of privacy in the name of national security.  Coming to the House floor in the wake of hearings on Waco and Ruby Ridge, the bill marks a dramatic expansion in the power of federal law enforcement.  The bill contains no provision for law enforcement accountability, but includes provisions about habeas corpus that will virtually strip the federal courts of their ability to remedy law enforcement abuse that results in unconstitutional incarceration.  The bill will have a chilling effect on domestic groups who are critical of U.S. foreign policies.  It will give the Executive the authority to blacklist certain groups by designating them terrorist organizations.  It will prevent Americans from inviting dissenting voices from other nations to speak or to visit the United States.  It will allow the deportation of individuals without giving them the opportunity to know why they are being deported.  It will give expanded powers to the FBI to obtain personal phone and travel records without a criminal predicate.  It will invite more illegal law enforcement wiretaps.  
<p>
<b>1.  Broad Terrorism Definition Risks Selective Prosecution</b>
<p>
H.R. 2768 defines "terrorism" as state and federal law crimes such as kidnaping, killing, serious assaults, and illegal property damage that creates a substantial risk of serious bodily injury when such crimes: (I) involve conduct in both the United States and abroad; (ii) meet a jurisdictional base; and (iii) are certified by the Attorney General as "terrorism" because the crime is calculated to retaliate against the government, or influence government conduct by intimidation or coercion, and is a violation of one of a number of federal criminal statutes.  Under this broad definition, virtually every serious crime involving conduct both within and outside of the United States is a federal crime of "terrorism" when the Attorney General says it is.  The "terrorism" label triggers severe penalties.  Despite efforts to narrow the definition of terrorism, this provision raises a substantial risk of arbitrary and discriminatory application because so much conduct (already a crime under federal or state law) triggers application of the section, and because the political motivation of the actor is presumed by the Attorney General, not found by a judge or jury.  The Attorney Generals certification is not subject to review by a court, and may be influenced by political considerations and pressures.
<p>
<b>2.  More Illegal Wiretaps and Less Judicial Control Will  Threaten Privacy	</b>
<p>
H.R. 2768 would dramatically reduce privacy rights in the United States because it would invite significantly more illegal law enforcement wiretaps with less judicial control, resulting in a significant increase in the number of entirely innocent conversations intercepted by law enforcement officials.  Already, too many innocent conversations -- nearly two million in 1994 alone -- are intercepted by federal and local law enforcement wiretaps.  In fact, every time a wiretap or other form of electronic surveillance is placed, nearly 1,800 innocent conversations are intercepted.  The FBI already has authority to conduct a wiretap to prevent the crimes which the public associates with terrorism.  The bill would strip judges of the power to order the FBI to periodically justify continuation of the wiretap.  It would also authorize courtroom use of evidence gathered in an illegal wiretap when law enforcement officers acted illegally, but in "good faith."  The Supreme Court has recognized that barring from court the fruits of an illegal search (such as a wiretap) is the only effective means of deterring such illegal searches.
<p>
<b>3.  Expansion of Counterintelligence and Terrorism Investigations Threatens Privacy</b>
<p>
The FBI would be handed additional access in counterintelligence investigations to complete records about the airline flights people in the U.S. have taken, the cars they have rented, and the hotels in which they have stayed, all without evidence establishing probable cause that such a person has been involved in criminal activity.  It could obtain this information merely by secretly (in an ex parte proceeding) showing a judge that it wanted the information for a foreign intelligence investigation and that there are facts giving reason to believe that the person to whom the records pertain is a "foreign power" or an agent of a foreign power engaged in "international terrorism" or "clandestine intelligence activities" that may involve a violation of federal criminal law.  It would also be given access, without any judicial intervention at all, to a persons name, address and local and long distance toll billing records merely by writing a letter to a phone company certifying that the information is "relevant" to an international terrorism investigation.
<p>
<b>4.  The Executive Would Decide Which Foreign Organizations Americans Could Support</b>
<p>
The bill would give the Secretary of State the authority to make criminal the provision of "material support" for the legal, non-violent, even charitable activity of foreign organizations the Secretary of State designates as "terrorist."  Because current law already prohibits the giving of material support for terrorist activities, the new law would prohibit material support for legal activities of organizations the Secretary of State disfavors for political reasons.  Had this bill been law a few years ago, it would have been illegal for human rights groups, relief organizations, and church-related groups to go to Central America and provide anything but medicine and religious materials through any organization the Secretary of State, for political reasons, declared a "terrorist" organization.  In addition, the bill would remove the statutory proscription on FBI investigation of First Amendment activities when the FBI is investigating support for "terrorist" activities.
<p>
<b>5.  Secret Evidence Would Be Used In Deportation Proceedings</b>
<p>
The bill would permit the government to deport aliens based on evidence kept secret from the alien, in violation of the alien's right to due process.  Secret evidence, in the form of classified information, could be used to deport any alien, whether a permanent resident or a visitor, accused of terrorism.  The bill would even effectively prohibit permanent resident aliens from choosing the lawyer who would review the secret evidence on their behalf because their choice would be limited to a handful of lawyers approved by the court.  The right to choose one's own attorney is a fundamental due process right.
<p>
<b>6.  Foreign Dissidents Would Be Barred From the United States</b>
<p>
The bill would prevent Americans from inviting controversial foreigners who dissent from government policies to visit the United States to speak because it would bar members of designated "terrorist" organizations from entering the country.  Current law already bars from the United States aliens who have, or might, engage in terrorist activity.  The bill is not aimed at these individuals.  Instead, the bill would bar members of groups selected by the Executive for foreign policy reasons.  Those groups most likely to be designated are the groups that dissent from U.S. foreign policy, or oppose the governing party of a U.S. ally.  Even those members who oppose violence, and have risked their lives to oppose those who would commit violent acts, would be barred if regarded as members of an organization designated by the Secretary of State.  They would be barred even absent any evidence giving reason to believe that they had, or would after entry, engage in any terrorist activity at all.  This provision of the bill would resurrect in principle the McCarthy-era McCarran-Walter Act.
<p>
<b>7.  Federal Courts Would Virtually Lose The Power To Correct Unconstitutional Incarceration</b>
<p>
The bill would require federal courts to ignore unconstitutional state court convictions and sentences unless the state court decision, though wrong as a constitutional matter, was "unreasonably" wrong.  The risk that innocent persons would be held in prison in violation of the constitution --or even executed--would increase dramatically because the bill imposes unreasonably short time limits for filing a claim for habeas corpus relief, limits almost all petitioners to one only round of federal review, and requires that the petitioner meet an extremely high "clear and convincing" burden of proof in order to secure relief.  For the first time, a time limit would be placed on the exercise of an important constitutional right:  "use it now or lose it" might be appropriate for vacation time, but not for prison time, particularly for a death-row prisoner when a life is at stake.
<p>
<b>8.  Aliens Are Equated With Terrorists</b>
<p>
Much of the bill has nothing to do with terrorism and everything to do with immigrant-bashing.  The FBI's investigation of the Oklahoma City bombing suggests that aliens had nothing to do with the bombing.  Nonetheless, this bill, touted as a response to the bombing, purports to strip aliens who are alleged to have entered without inspection by INS of their constitutional right to due process in deportation proceedings, open to the probing eyes of law enforcement immigration files submitted on a confidential basis, bar from the United States aliens who arrive without adequate travel documents and could not prove, in the airport upon arrival, a "credible" fear of persecution in their homeland, and render deportable long-time legal permanent residents convicted of minor crimes, even if they are the sole supporters of their family members who are U.S. citizen children.  The Oklahoma City bombing should not be used as an excuse to bash aliens or to enact restrictive immigration laws.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The ACLU opposes H.R. 2768 and urges members of the House to oppose the bill.  A detailed analysis of the bill is available from the ACLU.  For additional information, please contact Gregory T. Nojeim, Legislative Counsel, at the ACLU (202) 544-1681.

<TITLE>7-11-96 -- Defense of Marriage Act - S. 1740 </TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="/graphics/gay.gif"></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Testimony Regarding S. 1740 - Defense of Marriage Act</H1>
<P>Senate Judiciary Committee</P>
<P>July 11, 1996</P>
<P>Submitted by</P>
<P>Laura W. Murphy, Director, Washington Office</P>
<P>Matthew Coles, Director, Gay &amp; Lesbian Rights Project H. Alexander
Robinson, Legislative Representative</P>
<P><B>A. INTRODUCTION</B></P>
<P>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) appreciates the opportunity to
provide this testimony.  The ACLU is a private, nonprofit organization of more
than 275,000 members, dedicated to the preservation of civil liberties enshrined
in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. The American Civil Liberties Union
believes that S. 1740, the Defense of Marriage Act, is unconstitutional, and
that it is bad public policy.</P>
<P>The ACLU supports legal recognition of lesbian and gay relationships, and it
believes lesbians and gay men should have the right to marry.  Nothing else
would accord complete legal equality to lesbians, gay men and bisexuals.</P>
<P>Civil marriage is the way our society defines one's most intimate, committed
relationships; it is the only vehicle our society has for recognizing the
existence of primary relationships not defined by blood.  That has powerful
emotional consequences, and powerful practical consequences as well.  Our
society uses marriage to identify our partners for everything from retirement
programs, to critical medical decisions, to the simple right to be together in
crisis situations, like hospital emergency rooms.</P>
<P>While S. 1740 does not itself deny lesbians and gay men the right to marry,
it would for the first time deny federal recognition to state licenced
marriages. Clearly, this legislation is designed to be a preemptive strike to
nullify the rights that may be conferred by Hawaii and other states to same sex
couples.</P>
<P>S. 1740 would also for the first time make it federal policy that a state is
free to disregard some marriages of some couples who were legally married in
another state.  This could have very unfair, and in some cases tragic
consequences for couples who travel across the country, because their jobs are
transferred to other states, or because of the desire to be near relatives, or
for any number of legitimate reasons.  Among the consequences of S. 1740 would
be to deny federal recognition of a state sanctioned marriage and the rights to:
take bereavement or sick leave to care for a partner or  a partner's child;
qualify for pension or social security continuation when a partner dies; keep a
jointly owned home if a partner goes on Medicaid; file joint tax returns and
quality for spousal exemptions on income and estate taxes; qualify for veterans'
discounts on medical care, education and home loans based on partner's service;
apply for immigration and residency for partners from other countries.</P>
<P>We also believe that it is extremely unwise to proceed with this legislation
without the benefit of additional hearings.  This legislation raises complex
legal questions that should be fully considered by Members of Congress before
they are compelled to cast their vote.</P>
<P><B>B. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES RAISED BY S. 1740</B></P>
<P>1. Full Faith and Credit -- Equal Protection.</P>
<P>S. 1740 is unconstitutional because it constitutes discrimination against
lesbians and gay men under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and
because it violates Article IV section 1 of the Constitution (the &quot;Full
Faith and Credit clause&quot;).</P>
<P>a.  Full Faith and Credit.</P>
<P>First, S. 1740 violates the Article IV, Section 1 of the Constitution (the &quot;Full
Faith and Credit&quot; clause).  Article IV says</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts,
records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.  And the Congress may by
general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records and proceedings
shall be proved, and the effect thereof.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Section 2 of S. 1740 would allow state courts to ignore judgments from
courts in other states &quot;respecting&quot; marriages between two persons of
the same sex.  Among the judgments which typically involve marriage are
judgments of divorce, judgments awarding support or dividing property in
connection with a divorce or separation, and judgements about obligations
incurred because of marriage, like loan obligations, and obligations to vendors
like hospitals, health care providers.</P>
<P>The United States Supreme Court has ruled again and again that the Full
Faith and Credit clause obligates every state to respect the judgments of other
state courts, including judgments of divorce.  See, e.g. Williams v. North
Carolina 317 U.S. 287, 294 (1947);  Sherrer v. Sherrer 334 U.S. 343, 354-356
(1948).</P>
<P>The court has allowed two limited exceptions to that rule. First, a forum
state does not have to respect the judgement of a sister state that purports to
transfer title to real estate within the forum state.  Second, a state does not
have to respect &quot;penal&quot; judgments from other state courts. See, e.g.,
Fall v. Eastin 215 U.S. 1 (1909) and Huntington v. Attrill 146 U.S. 657 (1892).
Neither of those exceptions could remotely be stretched to fit S. 1740. 
Moreover, there is no &quot;policy&quot; exception. States which disagree with
the policy behind a law on which a judgment is based must enforce the judgement
nonetheless.  See, e.g., Williams v. North Carolina, supra, 317 U.S. at 294;
Sherrer v. Sherrer, supra, 334 U.S. at 354-356; and see Fauntleroy v. Lum 210
U.S. 230, 237 (1908).</P>
<P>While the Supreme Court has never decided what it means to say that one
state must accord Full Faith and Credit to a state created &quot;status&quot;
like a marriage outside the context of a judgment, it seems clear that at a
minimum, states are not free to completely ignore them.  The Commerce Clause and
the right to travel from state to state, even without Article IV, would seem to
prevent states from ignoring marriages in interstate commercial transactions, or
when the people of one state travel to another.  See, e.g., Shapiro v. Thompson 
394 U.S. 618, 629 (1969).</P>

<P>Moreover, while Article IV doubtless gives Congress the power to decide how
the judgments and acts of one state are to be proven in another, that power does
not extend to nullifying Article IV's basic requirement of Full Faith and
Credit.  Congress can not, under the guise of deciding what effect to give to 
judgements and acts which have been proven under a mechanism it has created,
decide that no Faith and Credit need be given at all.  See, e.g., Powell v.
McCormack 395 U.S. 486, 550 (1969)(Congress has the power to decide if its
members have the qualifications set out in the Constitution, but it may not, in
the guise of doing so, manufacture additional qualifications). See also, Thomas
v. Washington Gas Light Co., 448 U.S. 261, 272 n.18 (1980).  That, however, is
precisely what the bill purports to do.</P>
<P>b. Equal Protection.</P>
<P>Second, this entire bill violates the equal protection guarantee of the Due
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The third section of the bill creates a
definition of marriage for all federal purposes.  The definition says that a
marriage means &quot;only a legal union between one man and one woman....&quot; 
Just as the law struck down in Loving v. Virginia 388 U.S. 1 (1967)
discriminated on the basis of race because it made one's ability to marry depend
on one's race, this bill discriminates on the basis of sex because it makes
one's ability to marry depend on one's gender.  It matters not that neither men
nor women are unequally disadvantaged by the ban; whites and blacks were
punished alike for violating the law in Loving as well.  Loving v.</P>

<P>Virginia 388 U.S. at 11.  The right to equality is a personal right, not a
group right.  See, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke 438 U.S.
265, 289-290 (1978).</P>
<P>Classifications which discriminate on the basis of gender must be
substantially related to some important government purpose.  Craig v. Boren 429
U.S. 190, 204 (1976).  The only justification for the classification that
appears from the proponents of the bill is that it would preserve what they
regard as the &quot;traditional&quot; understanding of marriage.  See, Senator
Don Nickles &quot;The Defense of Marriage Act.&quot;  Quite apart from the fact
that this ignores a 200 year tradition of allowing each state to define
marriage, and using those definitions for federal purposes, tradition by itself
is not an important government purpose.  If it were, sex discrimination would be
the quite permissible; discrimination against women has a pedigree in tradition
at least as long and time honored as that of discrimination against same sex
couples in marriage.  See, e.g. Bradwell v. State 83 U.S. 130, 141
(1873)(Bradley, J., concurring); and see Stanton v. Stanton 421 U.S. 7, 14-15
(1975).</P>
<P>Furthermore, to the extent that S. 1740 was intended to disadvantage
lesbians and gay men it is constitutionally suspect for that reason as well. 
This bill disenfranchises lesbians and gay men in their efforts to gain
recognition for their most intimate relationship.  In our view, sexual
orientation classifications should be treated as suspect, like race and, we
believe, gender classifications.  See Watkins v. U.S. Army 837 F.2d 1428, affd.
on other grounds, 875 F.2d 699</P>
<P>(9th Cir. 1989); contra High Tech Gays v. D.I.S.C.O. 895 F.2d 563 (9th Cir.
1990).  But regardless of whether Courts treat classifications which
disadvantage lesbians and gay men as suspect, it is clear that like all other
classifications, they must serve some legitimate governmental purpose.  A mere
desire to harm the group which is disadvantaged is not a legitimate purpose. 
United States Department of Agriculture v. Moreno 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973); 
Romer v. Evans, U.S. , 64 U.S.L.W. 4353, 4356-4357 (1996).  Yet S. 1740 rests on
nothing more.  Saying that discrimination is nothing new and that one would like
to keep it up does not come close to explaining what legitimate interest a
classification serves.</P>
<P>As Justice Holmes put it,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that it was
so laid down in the time of Henry IV.  It is still more revolting if the grounds
upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply
persists from blind imitation of the past.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>O.W. Holmes, Collected Legal Papers, (Boston, A. Harcourt, 1920), p. 187.</P>
<P><B>C. PUBLIC POLICY</B></P>
<P>Finally, the bill is very bad policy.  We are a nation governed by one
Constitution.  We a not a collection of small nations with contiguous borders.
It does not make sense to say to Americans that the existence of their marriages
depends on which states they travel through on vacation, or which states their
employer transfers them.  Americans have a right to go from state to state,
without having to surrender their most intimate relationship as a price of
traveling or relocating.  Moreover, this bill would create a complex set of
legal and logistical problems which have not been fully examined.  Since
Congress has never sought to do anything of this kind questions about estates,
taxes, securities and exchange laws, joint property and shared liability for
debt have not been addressed by any of the relevant committees or sponsors of
this bill.</P>
<P>As noted above, civil marriage is the way our society defines a person's
committed relationships.  If one can not marry his or her partner, the two can
be legally ignored and discriminated against  in ways, great and small, that
would not be tolerated for a moment by the courts if they were married.  For
example, an unmarried partner can be excluded from the other partner's bedside
when crucial medical decisions are made, and even at death.  The lack of legal
standing may preclude any authority to carry out the partners wishes.</P>
<P>Marriage is the device our society uses to identify partners for virtually
every practical situation in which it is important to identify the person who is
closest to you.  To that end the Supreme Court has held that marriage is a
fundamental right.  See Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978) (holding that
the freedom to marry is a fundamental liberty protected by the Due Process
Clause).</P>
<P>The fact that a state allows same-sex couples to marry would not require any
religious institution to recognize or perform such marriages.  State marriage
laws are entirely separate from religious practices in our country.  The
granting of civil marriage to same-sex couples would not impose any requirements
on religious groups, but rather would ensure equal access to the complex
structure of rights and responsibilities that civil marriage has become.</P>
<P>Marriage is not premised on procreation.  See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381
U.S. 479 (1965) (right of marital privacy prohibits government from interfering
with efforts to actively avoid procreation).  In any event, many different-sex
couples do not choose or are unable to have children and many same-sex couples
do have children.</P>
<P>While marriage has traditionally been defined as a union between people of
different sexes, it was also traditionally defined as between people of the same
race.  As recently as 1967 state governments denied interracial couples the
right to marry.  Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967).  Marriage was also
traditionally understood to involve a man owning a woman as property.  We've
recognized that these traditions had to be abandoned because they were unfair.</P>
<P>We live in a society which attaches enormous civil, legal consequences to
marriage.  For example, a person's ability to keep the home she or he has shared
with a partner for 20, 30 or more years will depend on their marriage status,
especially if they are Medicaid recipients or die intestate.  A person's ability
to care for a sick or dying partner in most health care facilities depends on
whether they are married.  Most state laws treat partners who have not married
as strangers.  It is fundamentally unfair to say on the one hand that you must
marry to be treated as next of kin, and then to tell an entire class of
Americans who are next of kin in every real sense that they may not marry.</P>
<P><B>D. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P>This bill is bad constitutional law and bad policy.  For 200 years, Congress
has left it to the states to decide who they will marry, and to courts to make
sure they respect each other's decisions on that.  That is a fine tradition,
which ought to be respected.  This bill throws it on the trash heap and
belittles the relationships of lesbian and gay citizens.  Apart from being an
unmistakable violation of the Constitution, it is a deplorable act of hostility
unworthy of the support.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">CONGRESS UNDERMINES THE POWER OF THE JUDICIARY</H1>
<H2>An ACLU Special Report<BR>June 1996</H2>
<HR>
<H1>COURT STRIPPING: Congress' Campaign to Undermine the Power of the Judiciary</H1>
<P>After withstanding more than 200 years of recurrent attacks by the two other
branches of government,  the federal judiciary took a series of debilitating
blows this Spring when Congress passed a series of restrictions on the
independence, scope and power of the nation's federal courts.  They are:</P>
<UL>
<LI> The Prison Reform Litigation Act (enacted April 1996);
</LI>
<LI> Restrictions on the Legal Services Corporation (adopted April 1996);
</LI>
<LI> The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (enacted April 1996);
</LI>
<LI> Immigration legislation (approved by both Houses of Congress and now
pending in a Senate- House conference committee).
</LI></UL>
<P>These restrictions slam the courthouse door on   society's most vulnerable
members. And, by stripping the federal courts of a wide range of procedural and
substantive powers, they threaten what James Madison called &quot;an
impenetrable bulwark&quot; of American liberty:  a system of independent courts
with the power to strike down as unconstitutional all legislative or executive
acts that violate the Bill of Rights.</P>
<P>Ever since the Supreme Court established its role as the final arbiter of
constitutional rights in <I>Marbury v. Madison</I> in 1803, both the executive
and legislative branches have attempted to encroach upon the judiciary's
independence.   In fact, the current court stripping effort is unusual only in
that it has  succeeded where others have failed.</P>
<P>The impact of these Congressional actions is already being felt. Taking
advantage of the new Prison Litigation Reform Act, which weakens federal court
oversight of unconstitutional prison conditions, the District of Columbia filed
a brief on May 17th with the D.C. Court of Appeals arguing that an extensive
remedial plan ordered by a Federal District Judge be dismantled.  The plan
remedied unconstitutional conditions for women inmates at three D.C.
correctional institutions, including rampant sexual harassment and sub-standard
health care.</P>
<P>And on June 3rd, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in <I>Felker
v. Turpin</I>, a death penalty case from Georgia, and the first constitutional
test of the new restrictions on federal habeas corpus contained in the
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. </P>
<P>We issue this special report out of our grave concern that an independent
judiciary, which our nation's founders deemed essential to our constitutional
form of government, and which one eminent  scholar has called, &quot;America's
most distinctive contribution to constitutionalism (1) is now in jeopardy. </P>
<P>And we call upon both the Department of Justice, and on and Congress, 
particularly Members of the Judiciary Committees of  both Houses, to live up to
their responsibility to ensure that the federal judiciary is able to fulfill its
role as protector of constitutional rights -- a responsibility that they have,
in recent months, abdicated.</P>
<H2>The Courts Under Attack</H2>
<P>Although the federal courts have long been a target of politicians of every
stripe, a series of public and unusually vituperative attacks on individual
judges and on the federal bench as an institution has served as cover for
Congress' unprecedented power grab. In this highly politicized election year,
the federal judiciary emerged in the early pre-election campaign period as a
scapegoat for crime and a range of other social ills.</P>
<P>In February,  candidate Pat Buchanan called federal judges &quot;little
dictators in black robes,&quot; and advocated an end to life tenure on the
federal bench. The fire was fueled when Judge Harold Baer, a federal district
judge from New York, threw out evidence which he decided had been illegally
seized in a highly publicized drug case.  Amid a chorus of demands for Judge
Baer's resignation or impeachment,  Senator Bob Dole charged that one of &quot;the
root causes of the crime explosion&quot; was &quot;liberal&quot; judges
appointed by President Clinton. Dole went on to attack the American Bar
Association's role in evaluating judicial nominees, calling the ABA &quot;nothing
more than another blatantly partisan liberal advocacy group.&quot;  The Clinton
Administration responded with its own list of Reagan and Bush appointees who
have made decisions that it said could be deemed &quot;pro- defendant&quot;.
</P>
<P>All this  created a climate in which justice became politicized and judges
intimidated. And, as this special report demonstrates, it enabled Members of
Congress with an anti-civil liberties agenda to push through a series of laws
and restrictions that will have long lasting and profound consequences for the
independence and integrity of the federal courts.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>THE TROUBLESOME  &quot;EXCEPTIONS CLAUSE&quot;  </H2>
<P><B> </B>In 1981, Justice Potter Stewart, discussing his retirement,
answered a reporter's question about various proposals then pending in Congress
to strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over certain categories of cases. &quot;There
is nothing new about having such bills in Congress,&quot; Justice Stewart said. 
&quot;I think there have been such bills in Congress ever since I've been here,
in fact long before that.&quot;  But, Justice Potter went on to say that &quot;if
any such bills were enacted, it would present immediately very difficult
Constitutional questions.&quot;</P>
<P>The Constitutional questions Justice Potter referred to revolve around the
meaning of the Exceptions Clause under Article III of the Constitution.  </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other Public Ministers and
consuls, and those in which  a State shall be Party, the Supreme Court shall
have original Jurisdiction.  In all the other   Cases before mentioned, the
Supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law  and Fact,<I>with
such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall  make.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Supreme Court in<I>  Felker
v. Turpin</I>, we observe that, &quot;The extent to which this almost casually
adopted, last minute addition to Article III was meant to leave the role of the
Supreme Court as the ultimate arbiter of the Constitution at the whim of the
national legislature has been hotly debated by constitutional scholars for many
years.&quot;    </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<H1>THE PRISON LITIGATION REFORM ACT:  Stripping the Courts Power to Reform
Prisons</H1>
<P>The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) was swept into law as a virtual
footnote to the appropriations bill. It strips the federal courts of much of
their power to correct even the most egregious  prison conditions.   It does
this  by altering the basic rules which have always governed prison reform
litigation:</P>
<P><B>&#183; The PLRA makes it impossible to settle prison cases by consent
decree, and jeopardizes virtually every existing consent decree. </B>  </P>
<P>Many prison lawsuits are resolved by consent decree:  prison officials agree
to make changes in unconstitutional prison conditions, before trial and without
acknowledging any guilt.  The federal trial court then monitors the decree to
ensure full compliance within a reasonable amount of time.   This is the most
effective, efficient, and inexpensive method of achieving meaningful prison
reform.   It is clear from past experience that without the threat of court
intervention, state prison systems drag their feet and unconstitutional

conditions persist.</P>
<P>The new law forces prison officials to admit that they violated inmates'
constitutional rights before they can enter into a consent decree, opening
themselves up to personal liability.  The inevitable result is that most prison
litigation will now go to trial -- a hugely expensive and time consuming
proposition. Furthermore, existing consent decrees can be challenged under PLRA
as well, potentially sending every one of the cases upon which those decrees are
based back to court.   The magnitude of this change will be enormous since
two-thirds of the country's state prison systems have one or more facility
currently operating under a court order. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Inevitably, most prison litigation will now go to trial -- a hugely
expensive and time consuming proposition.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>&#183; The PLRA  limits the lifespan  of any  court judgment or consent
decree resulting from prison reform litigation to two years.  </B></P>
<P>History has shown that two years is an unreasonably short period of time in
which to effect meaningful change in the way a prison is run or to cure
seriously  substandard conditions<B>.</B>  Even if  no remedial action is taken
and conditions remain exactly as they were, the PLRA lets the government  off
the hook after two years, unless the court holds a new trial and finds that
conditions still fall short of what the Constitution requires.  In the same
vein, preliminary injunctions, which are issued in emergency cases sometimes
involving life and death situations,  have been given a 90-day shelf life unless
a trial is held and permanent relief granted during that time.  </P>
<P>In addition, the PLRA severely limits the longstanding practice and 
authority of the federal courts to assign Special Masters to oversee the reform
process. Still another provision drastically limits  attorneys' fee awards,
defunding lawyers who now handle prison cases, and discouraging others from
doing so in the future. </P>
<P>Politicians hostile to prison reform have long accused federal judges of
meddling in the day- to-day running of corrections institutions and entertaining
frivolous lawsuits initiated by inmates and their advocates.   But as Justice
William F. Brennan has observed, &quot;Judicial opinions in this area do not
make pleasant reading&quot; (concurrence in<I> Rhodes v. Chapman</I>, 1981).  
All of the deplorable conditions described below were remedied as a result of
prison reform litigation, followed by  federal court oversight.  The PLRA places
every one of the consent decrees in immediate jeopardy.(2)</P>
<P><B>Rape and sexual abuse</B> </P>
<UL>
<LI>In Washington D.C., prison guards sexually assaulted female prisoners on a
routine basis. One officer raped a prisoner while she was sick in the infirmary.
</LI>
<LI>In Georgia, dozens of women inmates were forced to have sex with prison
guards, maintenance workers and a prison chaplain. Many become pregnant and were
then pressured into having abortions.
</LI>
<LI>In Louisiana, female prisoners were forced to have sex with prison staff,
and with male inmates brought in by prison guards. 
</LI></UL>
<P><B>Physical abuse</B> </P>
<UL>

<LI>In a California prison, prisoners in restraints were severely beaten by
guards. They were kicked, hit with batons, and burned with scalding water. 
Their heads were bashed, their teeth knocked out, their jaws fractured and their
limbs broken.
</LI>
<LI>In Idaho, a 17-year-old boy in jail for failing to pay $73 in traffic fines
was tortured for 14 hours and finally murdered in his cell by other prisoners.
</LI>
<LI>In South Carolina, several suicidal juvenile inmates were transferred to

the state mental hospital where, naked or in paper gowns, their hands and feet
were bound to a bed and they were forcibly injected with psychotropic drugs.
</LI></UL>
<P><B>Squalid conditions and lack of medical care</B></P>
<UL>
<LI>In the U.S. Virgin Islands, one-man cells infested with rats housed four or
five prisoners. Mattresses on the floor were soaked by overflowing toilets, and
the drinking water was contaminated with sewage.
</LI>
<LI>In Pennsylvania, prison officials failed to implement basic tuberculosis
prevention procedures despite warnings by the Commissioner of Health.  As a
result of a federal court order, over 450 prisoners infected with TB were
identified in a single prison.
</LI>
<LI>In California, female prisoners received almost no pre-natal care and one
prisoner gave birth on the floor of the jail without medical assistance three
hours after telling prison staff that she was in active labor.

<H1>THE ANTITERRORISM AND EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT: Crippling Federal Habeas
Corpus</H1>
<P>Tucked away in the recently enacted anti-terrorism legislation is a
provision that will not combat terrorism, but will destroy what Alexander
Hamilton once described as the greatest liberty of all:  the Writ of Habeas
Corpus.  &quot;The Great Writ&quot; has been  a central part of the American
system of justice since Congress passed the first Judiciary Act in 1789.  After
the Civil War, the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 extended the right to the states. 
Under the law, convicted offenders serving state sentences have the right to
challenge the constitutionality of their conviction and sentence in federal
court.   For more than forty years, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly held
that federal courts are <I>required</I> to exercise independent judgment of
state prisoners' constitutional claims.  Now, in the name of fighting terrorism,
the federal courts have been stripped of their traditional power to assure that
state criminal convictions and sentences are constitutional.(3)</P>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1>FROM THE ACLU'S BRIEF</H1>
<P>in <B><I>Felker v. Turpin, </I>urging the Court to not to reach the
Exceptions Clause issue, or to find the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act unconstitutional</B></P>
<P>&quot;The question of whether, and to what extent, Congress can limit this
Court's appellate jurisdiction by invoking the Exceptions Clause has
implications that extend far beyond the narrow context of successive habeas
petitions.  In the early 1980s, literally scores of bills were introduced in
Congress to strip this Court (and often the lower federal courts, as well) of
jurisdiction to hear cases involving school prayer, school busing, and abortion.
 Fifteen years ago Congress wisely stepped back from the precipice by defeating
each of these assaults on the Court's jurisdiction.  But given the current
political climate, there is every reason to believe that these or similar bills
would be resurrected were this Court to adopt a view of the Exceptions Clause
that left Congress free to impose whatever limitations it chose on this Court's
appellate jurisdiction.</P>
<P>&quot;What may be conceivable in theory would be devastating in practice to
the real world system of checks and balances that has enabled our constitutional
system to function for 200 years.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>&#183;<B> Federal courts are now required to defer to state court decisions
even when those decisions are clearly wrong.</B>  </P>
<P>Under the new law, the federal judiciary cannot grant a writ of habeas
corpus unless a state court decision upholding the prisoner's conviction is &quot;unreasonably&quot;
wrong, or flatly contradicts clearly established Supreme Court rulings.  This
heightened standard makes it all but impossible for federal judges to review the
evidence and come to their own independent conclusions.  It elevates process
over results:    a person  convicted because of constitutional error, such as
the failure to disclose evidence establishing innocence, may well be foreclosed
from federal habeas relief as long as the state court allowed him to present his
arguments, even if the state court came to the wrong conclusion.  As one
prominent expert on habeas law said, &quot;It will be easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle than for a constitutional claim to get into federal

court in habeas.&quot;</P>
<P>The law's title, &quot;The Antiterrorism and <I> Effective Death Penalty</I>
Act,&quot; is chillingly apropos.   More than 40 percent of state-imposed death
sentences reviewed by federal appellate courts since the reinstatement of the
death penalty have contained reversible constitutional  errors.  Since 1973,
fifty-four people sentenced to death have been released from prison after
evidence of their innocence was uncovered.  Many of these miscarriages of
justice were avoided because of the availability of federal habeas review.  They
include cases in which defendants were victims of racism at trial, received
inadequate legal counsel, or were found guilty because the prosecution withheld
exculpatory  evidence.  Many, if not most, of these cases, would be unreviewable
under the new law.</P>
<P>&#183;<B> Prisoners are given an unreasonably short time limit for filing
federal habeas petitions.</B></P>
<P><B> </B>For the first time, a statute of limitations has been imposed on
the filing of habeas corpus petitions.  The new law limits the time span for
filing a habeas petition to one year from the time the conviction became final. 
If the state provides counsel for any post-conviction proceeding, however,  then
a state prisoner sentenced to death will have only six months to file a
petition. These time limits are exceptionally harsh and difficult to meet.  Six
months is not enough time for even the most diligent and skilled attorney to
reinvestigate the legal and factual issues involved in a death penalty case.  
</P>
<P>Had the Effective Death Penalty and Public Safety Act been the law of the
land in the past, Shabaka Waglini, Ricardo Guerra and Henry Drake, all innocent
men,  would not be alive today:</P>
<H2>Lives Saved by Habeas Corpus</H2>
<UL>
<LI><B>Shabaka Waglini</B> was convicted of first degree murder in 1974 and
sentenced to death in Florida. He came within 13 hours of execution when a
federal court granted his habeas corpus petition and ordered a new trial. It was
found that the prosecutor concealed FBI evidence proving that the fatal bullet
could not have come from Waglini's gun; allowed the only witness against Waglini
to lie in exchange for lenient treatment in another case; and misled the jury in
closing arguments. Waglini was ultimately released after spending 14 years on
death row for a crime he did not commit. 
</LI>
<LI><B>Ricardo Guerra</B> was convicted of murder by a Texas court and
sentenced to die in 1982. Every state court affirmed the conviction. But in
1993, in a federal habeas review, the court found that the prosecutor threatened
and intimidated witnesses, most of whom were children who spoke little English;
failed to disclose evidence that proved Guerra innocent; and knowingly presented
false evidence to the jury. The judge said that the prosecutors' &quot;misconduct
was designed to obtain a conviction and another 'notch in their guns' despite
the overwhelming evidence that (another man) was the killer and the lack of
evidence pointing to Guerra.&quot; 
</LI>
<LI><B>Henry Drake</B> was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in
Georgia in 1976.  The actual murderer, who was the star prosecution witness at
Drake's trial, admitted his guilt in an affidavit which he gave to his own
lawyer.  The lawyer was ethically bound by the attorney-client privilege not to
reveal the information.  Finally, after the real murderer died in 1982, the
lawyer made the evidence available to Drake, and he was released from prison. 
Under the new law's time limits, Henry Drake would have been foreclosed from
federal habeas review, and he would, in all likelihood, have been executed.

<HR>
<H1>NEW LEGAL SERVICES RESTRICTIONS</H1>
<P>The recently adopted appropriations bill not only slashes the funding for
the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) by a devastating one-third, but contains
crippling restrictions that effectively prevent the federal courts from
addressing and remedying constitutional violations of the rights of  poor
Americans.   </P>
<P>For more than two decades, the LSC has delivered quality legal services to
poor people throughout the U.S. who would otherwise have no access to justice. 
LSC-funded lawyers represent the poor, including the elderly and the disabled, 
in matters involving  health care, disability benefits,  domestic violence,
divorce, child abuse, neglect and custody, housing and employment.   LSC-funded
backup centers provided technical assistance and legal expertise.  Other
LSC-funded offices specialize in providing assistance to migrant workers, Native
Americans and other  groups historically excluded from the legal system.  But
Congress has carved out sweeping categories of cases that LSC may no longer
bring, even with non-LSC funds.</P>
<P>&#183;<B> The LSC may no longer  bring class action lawsuits or participate

in litigation to &quot;reform&quot; the welfare system.</B></P>
<P>The class action lawsuit, an enormously useful procedural device for
addressing and remedying systemic violations affecting large numbers of people,
gathers together all the claims of &quot;similarly situated individuals&quot; so
that they can be tried in a single lawsuit.  Without the class action, it would
have been virtually impossible for the federal courts to desegregate the South's
public schools, or to remedy the horrific conditions that existed in state-run
mental institutions throughout the country.  But today, the class action is
effectively off-limits to the needy.  The new regulations prohibit LSC-funded
attorneys from bringing class action suits, from participating in litigation to
&quot;reform&quot; the welfare system, or from challenging any existing welfare
law.</P>
<P>Had these regulations been in place before, the following small but typical
sampling of class action lawsuits could not have been brought and won by LSC
lawyers:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>On behalf of disabled people:</B>  In 1983, LSC lawyers brought a
successful class action lawsuit on behalf of tens of thousands of disabled
people who had been improperly denied disability benefits by the Social Security
Administration.  The court found that some members of the class had already died
or suffered further illness as a result of the government's actions.  Without a
class action, only those relatively few disabled recipients able to retain
lawyers could have won the restoration of their benefits.  The rest would have
been out in the cold.
</LI>
<LI><B>On behalf of former homeowners:  </B>In the early 1990s, LSC assisted
Georgia homeowners who had lost their homes because their lending institution
had engaged in fraudulent and deceptive practices.  A class action was brought,
and more than 20,000 defrauded customers were eventually compensated for their
losses.
</LI>
<LI><B>On behalf of poor children:</B>  In the early 1970s, schools were
closed in California wine country so that students could help harvest the
grapes.  The country welfare officials said that all AFDC (Aid to Dependent
Children) recipients ten years old or over had to work in the fields or lose
their benefits.  Families, including children, were forced to work in fields
with no toilets and unsanitary drinking water.  LSC brought a successful class
action and stopped the county from violating state child labor and AFDC laws.
</LI>
<LI><B>On behalf of the elderly:</B>  In the early 1990s, thousands of elderly
people were  cut off from Illinois' Community Care Program, which provides home
and community- based services to those who would otherwise require nursing home
care, without notice or a hearing.  LSC brought a class action and won a
settlement reinstating all those who had been improperly removed from the
program, and establishing due process standards.

<HR>
<H1>THE ANTITERRORISM LAW AND PENDING IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION:  No Due Process
for Immigrants</H1>
<P>The anti-terrorism law, and immigration legislation that is currently
pending in conference, contain significant court stripping provisions which
compromise the due process rights of all  immigrants, including long-term
permanent residents, regardless of the strength of their legal claims.</P>
<P><B>&#183; The legislation eliminates due process safeguards for allegedly
undocumented aliens, including political refugees </B></P>
<P>One extreme court stripping provision, originally included in the House's
immigration proposal, was tacked onto the new anti-terrorism law and enacted in
April.  It radically changes the immigration adjudication process by shielding
decisions made by Immigration and Naturalization Service employees from any
administrative or judicial review.  Anyone arriving in the U.S. without proper
documentation, or anyone already in the U.S. who is believed to have crossed the
border without presenting proper documentation, <I>even if such a person has
been residing in this country for many years, </I>can be &quot;summarily
excluded,&quot; i.e., instantly deported, to his or her country of origin.  </P>
<P>The new law will have its most devastating impact on legitimate refugees
forced to flee their country without valid travel documents.  Upon arrival, they
will have to persuade an INS official  that they have a legitimate fear of
persecution  on account of their political opinion, race, religion, national
origin, or membership in a particular social group.  Should they fail to
convince the INS in the airport, immediately upon arrival, that they can prove
their asylum case, they will no longer have the right to a hearing before an
immigration judge or the right to  federal judicial review.  Instead of a
federal judge being the final arbiter of a political asylum claim -- a decision
that may be of life or death proportions -- that responsibility now resides with
the INS.  There is no appeal.  The equivalent in a criminal case would be having
the police and prosecutor determine guilt or innocence at the scene of the
crime, instead of leaving this determination to a judge or a jury at a hearing.</P>
<H2>Tragedy Averted</H2>
<P>Had summary exclusion been the law of the land in December 1994, Fauziya
Kasinga might have been returned to Togo:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Fauziya Kasinga</B> is a young woman who fled her homeland in order to
escape genital mutilation, a traditional practice in portions of Africa and the
Middle East, and arrived in the U.S. with fraudulent papers necessary for her
escape.   After languishing in an INS detention facility for more than a year
while her political asylum claim was pending, Ms. Kasinga was released only
after her story was made public.  Her claim is being considered by the Board of 
Immigration Appeals and if it is rejected, she will have the right to federal
court review.  But if the new law had been in place, it is more than likely that
she would have been excluded immediately upon her arrival in this country and
sent back to Togo.   Genital mutilation has only recently been asserted as
grounds for refugee status, and the law in this area is still evolving.  Would
the INS employee who initially interviewed her have made the right decision?
</LI></UL>
<P><B>&#183; The pending immigration bill  strips from the federal courts the
power to make remedial orders to correct large scale constitutional violations
of immigrants' rights</B></P>
<P>The House version of the pending legislation eliminates all &quot;pattern
and practice&quot; class action challenges to immigration policies and
practices.  This litigation tool has made it possible  for the federal courts to
address and remedy serious INS abuses against classes of immigrants, including
coercive arrest and deportation practices; abominable conditions of detention;
and discrimination against Haitians, Salvadorans and other nationalities. 
Robbed of the ability to entertain pattern and practice lawsuits, it will be
almost impossible for the federal judiciary to  rein in an agency that is
notoriously overworked, inefficient and often discriminatory.  </P>
<H2>Corrupt Asylum Process Reformed</H2>
<H4>If the pending legislation passes, this kind of litigation will become a
thing of the past</H4>
<UL>
<LI><I>American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh</I> is the name of a class
action lawsuit brought by the ACLU and other groups in 1985.   It charged the
INS with systematic discrimination against political refugees from El Salvador
and Guatemala. Though they faced clear persecution and even death at home, where
ferocious civil wars were raging, these refugees were routinely denied political
asylum because the American government supported the repressive Salvadoran and
Guatemalan regimes. Nicaraguans, on the other hand, were just as routinely
granted asylum because of U.S. opposition to the ruling Sandinistas.  A 1990
settlement  ruled that foreign policy considerations could not be the
determining factor in asylum decisions, and ordered  new hearings for many of
the 240,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans in the U.S.  This single, pattern and
practice lawsuit brought about the reform of the entire asylum process.
</LI></UL>
<P><B>&#183; Federal courts are precluded from reviewing certain deportation
orders</B></P>
<P>The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which was enacted in
April, prohibits any court from reviewing a final order of deportation entered
against a long-time legal permanent resident if the immigrant has committed even
a minor criminal offense (one for which the sentence that could have been
imposed is one year of imprisonment).  This means that such minor, nonviolent
offenses as theft of cable TV services , for example, deprives a legal permanent
resident of <I>any</I> opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of his
deportation.</P>
<P>The Senate version of the pending immigration bill contains an even broader
provision that prohibits judicial review of <I>any</I> denial of discretionary
relief by an immigration judge.  That means that if the immigration judge abuses
his discretion, no court may review the decision.</P>
<P> <B>&#183; The pending immigration bill places insuperable procedural
obstacles in the path of aliens seeking judicial review of INS decisions  </B></P>
<UL>
<LI>The Senate version says that aliens have a right to legal counsel only so
long as it does not &quot;unreasonably delay&quot; the proceedings. Currently,
new arrivals have at least 14 days to secure an attorney before an
administrative hearing can be held. The House version reduces the time to ten
days; the Senate version to only three.
</LI>
<LI>Both Senate and House bills would delete a statutory requirement that
notices of deportation grounds be written in both English and Spanish.  As a
result, even if an alien is entitled to a hearing to assert his or her legal
rights, they will in effect forfeit their right because they do not understand
the charging document.
</LI>
<LI>Under current law, when an alien files a petition for judicial review, any
deportation order against that alien is automatically stayed until the court
renders a decision.    Under the Senate bill, the stay is no longer automatic;
the alien must affirmatively seek a stay of deportation from the INS or from the
court.  This greatly increases the likelihood that aliens with good legal claims
will be deported before a court can even consider them.
</LI></UL>
<H1>CONCLUSION</H1>
<P>An independent federal judiciary is essential to preserve and enforce
fundamental rights.  This does not mean that the courts or individual judges
should be immune from popular or academic criticism.  But by disabling the
federal courts in advance from executing their constitutionally mandated duty
and responsibility to safeguard individual rights, Congress  threatens the
delicate balance between majoritarian rule and respect for the rights of
individuals.  The first victims of court stripping -- immigrants, prisoners, the
poor -- will not be the last.  The most unpopular and vulnerable members of
society are all too often the first targets of government repression.  But once
the federal courthouse door has been slammed shut to one group, it won't be long
before others are similarly excluded.  </P>
<P>The only question is, who will be next?  </P>

<CENTER><H1>Immigrants and the Economy</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><EM>"Is it true that immigrants take jobs away from Americans<BR> 
and are a drain on the economy?"</EM></CENTER>
<P>
<STRONG>BACKGROUND</STRONG>
<br>
Blaming immigrants for the nation's woes has long been an American
pastime, especially in hard economic times like today.  Recently, there
has been an upsurge in anti-immigrant sentiment, particularly in areas of
the country that host large number of immigrants.  Public opinion surveys
indicate that the public does draw a distinction between legal and
undocumented immigrants, and that the public regards undocumented
immigrants with increasing disfavor. 
<P>
One of the most well-entrenched myths about immigrants is that they steal
jobs from American workers, collect an excess of government benefits and
in general represent a drain on the economy. According to an August 1993
Field Poll of Californians, 39 percent of respondents agreed that illegal
immigrants are "taking jobs away from Californians." But these are all
myths that must be refuted to create a more hospitable environment for
immigrants' rights. 
<P>
<STRONG>IN BRIEF</STRONG>
<br>
<UL>
<LI>Contrary to popular belief, immigrants do not take away jobs from
American workers. Instead, they create new jobs by forming new businesses,
spending their incomes on American goods and services, paying taxes and
raising the productivity of U.S. businesses.  Immigrants are good for the
economy, not the other way around. 
<P>
<LI>A U.S. Department of Labor study prepared by the Bush Administration
noted that the perception that immigrants take jobs away from American
workers is "the most persistent fallacy about immigration in popular
thought" because it is based on the mistaken assumption that there is only
a fixed number of jobs in the economy. 
<P>
<LI>Experts note that immigrants are blamed for unemployment because
Americans can see the jobs immigrants fill but not the jobs they create
through productivity, capital formation and demand for goods and services. 
<P>
<LI>Immigrants pay more than $90 billion in taxes every year and receive
only $5 billion in welfare. Without their contributions to the public
treasury, the economy would suffer enormous losses. 
</ul>
<P>
<STRONG>ACLU POLICY</STRONG>
<br>
The ACLU recognizes that the U.S., like every country, has the right to
control who enters the country and to enforce the integrity of its
internationally recognized borders.  It also has the right to deport
persons in the country who are not authorized to be here.  However, the
ACLU also believes that the power to exclude and deport must be exercised
fairly, humanely and consistent with the constitutional norms of due
process and non-discrimination, and believes that the government must
comply with the legal and humanitarian principles of international law
that bind the United States. 
<P>
<STRONG>ARGUMENTS, FACTS, QUOTES</STRONG>
<br>
In a 1990 American Immigration Institute Survey of prominent economists,
four out of five said that immigrants had a favorable impact on economic
growth.  None said that immigrants had an adverse impact on economic
growth. 
<P>
A 1994 study of unemployment and immigration by Richard Vedder and
Lowell Galloway of Ohio University spanning 100 years (from 1891 to 1991)
found that higher rates of foreign-born population historically have
corresponded to lower unemployment rates.  The study found that immigrants
expand total output and the demand for labor, tend to be highly productive
and promote capital formation through high savings rates. 
<P>
According to a L.A. Times analysis summarizing the best available
research, "Immigrants contribute mightily to the economy, by paying
billions in annual taxes, by filling low-wage jobs that keep domestic
industry competitive, and by spurring investment and job-creation,
revitalizing once-decaying communities.  Many social scientists conclude
that the newcomers, rather than drain government treasuries, contribute
overall far more than they utilize in services." (January 6, 1992). 
<P>
Studies by the Rand Corporation, the University of Maryland, the Council
of Economic Advisors, the National Research Council and the Urban
Institute all show that immigrants do not have a negative effect on the
earnings and employment opportunities of native-born Americans.  A 1989
Department of Labor study found that neither U.S. workers in complementary
jobs, nor most minority workers, appear to be adversely affected by
immigration. 
<P>
<CENTER><EM>"The truth is that the challenges we face as a nation have not been<BR>
imported by our immigrants, nor would they disappear if we could only<BR>
succeed in sealing our borders for good -- even if that were possible.  In<BR>
fact, there is good reason to believe that some of the problems we should<BR>
take most seriously as a people -- from the decline in our economic<BR>
competititiveness to the decay of our community values -- are problems<BR>
that the new immigrants can help us solve."  <BR></EM>

"Immigration is Source of our Strength," USA Today, July 19, 1993.</STRONG> </CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The fact that individuals define themselves in a significant  way
through their intimate sexual relationships with others suggests, in  a Nation
as diverse as ours, that there may be many right ways of conducting  those
relationships,   and that much of the richness of a relationship will come from
the freedom  an individual has to choose the form and nature of these intensely

</P>
<P>Gay and Lesbian rights have moved to the center of the American stage.  At 
no time  in our nation's history have gay men and lesbians been more visible,
fighting  for their  rights in Congress, in the courts, in workplaces, in the
community.   Much has changed since the gay rights movement began in the late
1960's:  sodomy laws have been repealed or struck down in most states; nine
states  and many cities  ban discrimination based on sexual orientation; and &quot;domestic
partnerships&quot;  are now recognized by growing numbers of corporations and
universities.   At the same time, anti-gay hostility has become more open and
virulent, posing  formidable challenges to gay rights advocates.

<P>The struggle for legal equality for lesbians and gay men rests on several 
fundamental constitutional principles.  Equal protection of the law is
guaranteed  by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. &nbsp;Freedom of speech and
association,  including the right to form social  and political organizations,
to socialize, to produce works of art with gay  and lesbian&nbsp;themes, and to
speak out,  is guaranteed by the First Amendment.

<TITLE>06/16/96: Visions of Liberty, The Fire This Time</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="/graphics/vision.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P><I>by Ira Glasser, ACLU Executive Director</I></P>
<H1>The Fire This Time</H1>
<P>Like a nightmare from my childhood, the stories and photos about black
churches burning throughout the deep South make me shiver with fear, evoking
memories of a time when terror against people of color was a routine feature of
Southern life and an essential ingredient of a system of racial subjugation.</P>
<P>Why now, after all these years, has this nightmare sprung to life again?
Jesse Jackson offers an answer.  &quot;It seems that the blue suits are engaging
in anti-civil rights propaganda and legislation in Congress, and the black robes
are handing out restrictive rulings in the courts, and the white sheets are
doing the burning,&quot; Jackson said.  &quot;There is a kinship among these
things.&quot;</P>
<P>Is there?  Not literally, perhaps.  Certainly, the criminals who set fire to
black churches did not conspire with the leaders of Congress who have proposed a
bill to end affirmative action remedies, nor with those Supreme Court justices
who have decided voting rights cases in a way that will lead to a purge of black
legislators -- just this week the Court declared unconstitutional four more
majority black districts.</P>
<P>But there may indeed be a kinship nonetheless.</P>
<P>Back in 1963, on the day after four young black girls in Birmingham, Alabama
were killed when a bomb exploded in their church during Sunday services, a young
lawyer named Charles Morgan, Jr. made a similar point.  The blame, he said, did
not fall only on those who planted the bombs, but also upon the &quot;good
people&quot; of Birmingham, who by their silence and their acceptance of the
subjugation of blacks had created a climate in which the bomb throwers felt
justified.  The good people violated no law but they did commit a crime of

another kind: it was called complicity.</P>
<P>As Morgan was right in 1963, so Jackson is right today.  There is a kinship
among these things, and it is our obligation to explore it.</P>
<P>For fifteen years now, many of our political leaders have called for an end
to remedies for racial discrimination.  In the face of overwhelming evidence of
suffocating racial disparities, politicians have declared the disease of racism
cured, and the playing field level.  Any remaining racial differences -- in
employment, in housing, in education, in political representation, in prison
populations -- must be the fault of blacks themselves, they have implied,
because they could not possibly be attributable any longer to the enduring
effects of racial subjugation.</P>
<P>These relentless lies have poisoned the moral air in America.  They have
defused the passion to remedy the effects of racism and instead encouraged
resentment against its victims.  And the Supreme Court, which from 1954 on had
played such an important role in setting the nation's moral tone, today echoes
the politicians' lies by steadily eroding the ability of black candidates to
find equal opportunity at the ballot box.</P>
<P>Those who breathe this poisoned air -- who are too young to have breathed
any other air -- direct their anger and their resentment not against racism but
against its victims.  And a few of them, demented to be sure, act out that
resentment and somehow come to feel comfortable enough to burn black churches.</P>
<P>Yes, there is a kinship among these things and it is a kinship we had better
address.  For this is not the first time we have seen such kinship in America. 
After the Civil War, unprecedented and sweeping civil rights legislation was
passed to guarantee equal rights regardless of race and to prohibit racial
discrimination in voting, public accommodations and the criminal justice system.
 In addition, Congress set up special economic programs and facilitated a
massive voter registration effort.  By 1867, there were -- incredibly -- 735,000
blacks and 635,000 whites registered to vote in the ten states of the Old South.
 It appeared as if a remarkable reconstruction might take place.</P>
<P>And then it crumbled.  Angry white groups willing to use terror and violence
became widespread.  Throughout the South, Republicans committed to ending the
enduring effects of slavery were gradually replaced by Democrats committed to
the subjugation of blacks.  And after the 1874 elections, Congress was also
transformed:  a 110-vote Republican majority became a 60-vote Democratic
majority.  Two years later, in order to win the presidency, the Republican
candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, agreed to renounce the use of federal power to
protect the rights of Southern blacks.  And in 1873 the Supreme Court joined the
retreat by interpreting the newly-minted Fourteenth Amendment to allow states
the authority to decide which rights their citizens should have.</P>
<P>Once the definition and enforcement of civil rights were left to state and
local governments, blacks were once again at the mercy of their oppressors.</P>
<P>Nearly a hundred years of violent terror followed, relieved only by the
civil rights movement of the sixties and the consequent resolve of Congress and
the courts to address again the persistent effects of centuries of racial
subjugation.</P>
<P>It is no exaggeration to say that the political and judicial retreat during
the 1870s paved the way for the Ku Klux Klan's long reign of terror.  So, too,
it is legitimate to suggest that the burning of black churches today is related
to the current political and judicial retreat: &quot;There is a kinship among
these things.&quot;</P>
<P>Consider, too, General Colin Powell -- certainly no radical -- who recently
commented upon the retreat from affirmative action remedies by saying that &quot;the
progress achieved over the past generation must be continued if we wish to bless
future generations....  We must fight misguided government efforts to shut it
all down.&quot;</P>
<P>Either that, or more nightmares.</P>

<P><I>by Ira Glasser, ACLU Executive Director</I></P>
<H2>Storm Warning</H2>
<P>New York, June 23 -- Taking their cue from the blockbuster movie &quot;Twister,&quot;
politicians are warning us about an impending storm -- a storm of  &quot;youth
violence.&quot;</P>
<P>Over the next 15 years, according to a recent fact sheet produced by the
House Subcommittee on Crime, &quot;the number of teenagers will soar to the
highest level in American history.&quot;  Brace yourself, we are warned, for the
&quot;coming storm of violent juvenile crime.&quot;</P>
<P>The image of an army of sociopathic teen &quot;super-predators&quot; ready
to rise up against the citizenry is the product of some fancy special effects,
even fancier than those found in &quot;Twister.&quot;  But a storm of youth
violence isn't brewing on the horizon any more than the actors up on the movie
screen were fleeing a real tornado.</P>
<P>Contrary to the Subcommittee's &quot;facts,&quot; scientific population
projections show that while the number of young people between 15 and 24 --  the
crime-prone years -- will increase in the next decade, this increase will not
exceed that for 1980.  In other words, there will be a bulge, not a &quot;storm&quot;
or even a high wind, and it won't be unprecedented.</P>
<P>But that hasn't stopped Congress from considering the &quot;Violent Youth
Predator Act of 1996,&quot; slated for hearings and action later this week.  The
Act would mandate automatic adult prosecution of children as young as 13,
encourage states to hold parents criminally responsible for their children's
acts, open up juvenile arrest records to the public, and, for the first time,
allow for children to be housed with adult prisoners.</P>
<P>These measures sound tough indeed, at a time when competition for who can
sound toughest on crime is practically an Olympic sport.  But what does it mean
to be &quot;tough&quot; on crime?  If being tough means being effective, few
politicians have been tough.  If it means sounding tough but being ineffective,
they've all been tough.</P>
<P>Take the &quot;get tough&quot; proposal to throw children as young as 13 in
jail with adults.   Recent studies, cited on &quot;Nightline&quot; and
elsewhere, show that juvenile offenders who serve time in adult prisons have a
higher recidivism rate than those who serve time in juvenile facilities geared
towards prevention.  But scapegoating children leads to public policies that
have everything to do with placating an anxious public, and nothing to do with
reality.</P>
<P>The sponsors of this act know what the real problem is.   Only days before
this legislation was announced with great fanfare, the results of the non-profit
Luxembourg Income Study were released: the United States has the highest child
poverty rate in the developed world -- 26 percent.   This is the real problem
that our elected leaders are shrinking from confronting.</P>
<P>Instead, they're turning children, or more accurately, poor  children, into
America's latest scapegoats.  Children are politically defenseless: they can't
vote, and they are now being blamed for everything from crime to the breakdown
of the family.  Ignoring social and economic causes, their circumstances are
blamed on individual moral failure.  Poor teenagers, we are told over and over

again, are uneducated, lazy, irresponsible, crime-prone and violent. (Where have
we heard that before?)</P>
<P>Add &quot;illegitimate&quot; to the list, too.  According to the so-called
family values crowd, &quot;illegitimate&quot; children are more numerous than
ever.  What's more, if they are born female, they grow up to be unwed teenage
mothers who have more &quot;illegitimate&quot; children.   And if they are born
male, they grow up to be -- you guessed it -- super-predators.</P>
<P>It should surprise no one that the current demonization of children is based
on  exaggeration, not fact.   The rate of babies born to unwed black teenagers
is the same today as it was in 1970:  80 per 1,000 unmarried teenagers.    And
the crime rate is, and always has been, affected mainly by the proportion of the
population that is young and male -- and bereft of hope or a stake in the
future.</P>
<P>It should surprise no one, either, that it's all been said before.  In 1872,
during an earlier period of rapid economic and social change, one commentator
described the same ineluctable process:  &quot;All the neglect and bad education
and evil example of a poor class tend to form others, who, as they mature, swell
the ranks of ruffians and criminals.  So, at length, a great multitude of
ignorant, untrained, passionate, irreligious boys and young men are formed...&quot;</P>
<P>The government's reflexive response to such &quot;evil,&quot; then as now,
is to punish rather than address the underlying problems.    Especially in this
election year, politicians are falling all over themselves to come up with &quot;tougher&quot;
(read: ineffective) measures -- like the &quot;Violent Youth Predator Act&quot;
-- for dealing with today's &quot;ignorant, untrained and passionate&quot; kids.</P>
<P>In a recent speech on &quot;basic values,&quot; Bob Dole referred to the &quot;plague
of illegitimacy&quot; that he says is sweeping the country.   Dole also supports
uniforms and curfews, plus locking up juvenile offenders in adult prisons and
punishing unwed teenage mothers by cutting off  their welfare benefits.  Bill
Clinton, posturing as the stern-but-fair First Daddy, goes out of his way to
endorse school uniforms and curfews.    And it's still early in the campaign.</P>
<P>Scapegoats serve a purpose.  They are potent symbols used to divert an
anxious public's attention away from real problems.  They are also an occasion
to pass all kinds of repressive laws that threaten everybody's rights.  Curfews,
for instance, are applied to all teenagers, not just the handful that commit
crimes.  Politicians, anxious to be re-elected,  create a diversion to appear
tough, but let the real problems fester.  They aren't interested in long-term
solutions, just quick fixes.</P>
<P>When you strip away the &quot;special effects&quot; -- the inflamed
rhetoric, the skewed statistics, and the ineffective &quot;solutions&quot; --
what you are left with is an empty sound stage.  Not much of a show, is it?</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="/graphics/vision.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P><I>by Ira Glasser, ACLU Executive Director</I></P>
<P>Those Weren't the Days, My Friend</P>
<P>Pick up any newspaper or turn on the TV and you'll find there's a 50's
revival going on.  I'm not talking about the Broadway musical &quot;Grease&quot;
playing down the block here in Times Square.  I'm talking about the new
merchants of virtue, whose theme song seems to be &quot;those were the days.&quot;
</P>
<P>We hear it from Jesse Helms, who has become an art critic, and from members
of Congress and even presidential candidates, who have become film and movie
critics. We hear it from William Bennett, author of <I>The Book of Virtues</I>,
and from Gertrude Himmelfarb and Newt Gingrich, who talk to us about the need to
revive Victorian morality.  We hear it from Rush Limbaugh, who tells us about
the ways things ought to be, when he's really talking about the way things used
to be.  </P>
<P>Why is it, I wonder, that those who yearn for the good old days have so much

in common with good ole boys?  </P>
<P>Over and over again we see headlines and polls telling us that we are a
nation in moral decline, that something terrible happened in the sixties that
loosened the wonderful moral bonds of the fifties.  </P>
<P>Recent news stories have even suggested that the disturbed behavior of
Theodore Kaczynski, the accused Unabomber, was somehow caused by the protest
movements of the sixties. </P>
<P>Shortly after Kaczynski was apprehended, The New York Times wrote that &quot;Mr.
Kaczynski's sharp turn away from society occurred after he spent several years
in the 1960s on two college campuses -- Ann Arbor, Michigan and Berkeley,
California -- that were seedbeds of a counterculture that reacted profoundly
against not only the war in Vietnam, but against materialism and many of
society's standards as well.&quot;   And a story last week in The New York Times
quoted one observer as saying that Kaczynski was &quot;a product of what was in
the air.&quot;</P>
<P>But what was in the air was not nihilism or a rejection of society but its
opposite: a reaction against social injustice and a growing, passionate movement
to remedy it.  The sixties were in fact a time of moral rejuvenation, of
rebellion against many injustices, a time of optimism and belief in the capacity
of politics and protest to right civil wrongs.</P>
<P>Many of us who were young during that time were transformed by it.  I myself
was also a graduate mathematics student with a bright future in that field, and
taught mathematics at several colleges.  Driven by my passion for social justice
and the magnetic attractions of an opportunity to do something about it, I, too,
was one of those who left mathematics and chose a radically different course. 
So did many others.  </P>
<P>Very few of us ended up as hermits and virtually none of us as mad bombers. 
Theodore Kaczynski was a disturbed person and perhaps the context of his life
led him to act out that disturbance in particular ways.  But it oversimplifies
and demeans the alchemy of that time to suggest that the turmoil of the sixties
somehow produced demented behavior.  </P>
<P>For most of us, it produced instead precisely the opposite: constructive
lives devoted to human rights and social justice, and real changes that have
made today's America a more moral place than the country we grew up in during
the 1950s.</P>
<P>Abolishing the gross abuses of individual rights in so short a time as we
did was arguably the greatest moral advance this nation or any other nation has
ever experienced.  </P>
<P>Think about it: during the fifties, racial segregation and subjugation was
the permissible law of the land, enforced by state-sanctioned terror. 
Throughout the South, people of darker skin color, for that reason alone, were
not permitted to vote, serve on juries, enjoy public accommodations like
restaurants, movie theaters, hotels and swimming pools, enroll in &quot;white&quot;
public schools or even use &quot;white&quot; public toilets.  And they were not
infrequently beaten or killed if they tried.  While all this was going on,
children prayed every day in Southern schools.  Was that a model of morality?</P>
<P>During the fifties, throughout the country, women were largely limited to
the role of wife and mother, denied equal opportunity in education and
employment and often forced to risk degradation and death to terminate a
pregnancy: it was not until 1965 that laws prohibiting even married couples from
obtaining contraceptives were struck down by the Supreme Court.  Women
everywhere, including conservative women, benefitted from that decision, and it
was an advance for morality, not a retreat.</P>
<P>During the fifties, gay men and lesbians lived secret lives, terrorized by
the fear of revelation; their most intimate, personal relationships criminalized
in more than half the states.  And the disabled were hidden away, their physical
disabilities compounded by imposed social and economic restrictions.</P>
<P>And free speech wasn't so free either in the fifties: loyalty oaths
prevailed, the Attorney General kept a list of disapproved political
organizations, the FBI infiltrated and harassed people whose views J. Edgar

Hoover didn't like, and congressional committees summoned citizens to account
for their political beliefs and associations and rat on their friends. Those who
refused often lost their jobs and some even went to jail.  </P>
<P>Yes, those certainly were the days.  But they were not moral days.  The
sixties, above all else, were a time of civic virtue, and the credit for
confronting immoral situations and changing  them belongs to the protest
movements of that time.  Those who pretend differently are revising history.</P>

<H2>More Reefer Madness
</H2><P>	Even though I've been in the "business" of protecting civil liberties
against the abuses of government for almost 30 years (I joined the staff
of the New York Civil Liberties Union in 1967!), I am still amazed at how
often public policies that affect the lives of millions of people, sometimes
very adversely, are based on pure myth.  There are hundreds of examples:
<P>	Myth:	Poor women have babies so that they can increase their monthly
welfare checks.
<P>	Political solution:  Pass "family cap" laws that deny additional benefits
to any additional children.
<P>	The truth:  There is no evidence that women have more children in order
to get more money from the government, no evidence that punishing women (and
their children) will, 	in fact, deter them from having more babies, and anyway,
women on welfare have fewer children than women who are not on welfare.	
<P>	Myth:  We are experiencing an "unprecedented crime wave" caused by a
"ticking time bomb" of "superpredator" juveniles hell bent on killing, maiming
and robbing us.
<P>	Political solution:  We must protect ourselves by getting rid of the
juvenile justice system which "coddles" young criminals, and lock them up
for longer periods of time in adult prisons.
<P>	The truth:  Juvenile crime levels are lower than they were in 1980, juveniles
commit only a handful of the violent crimes in this country (13%), and recent
studies show that locking young offenders up with adults leads to higher,
not lower re-arrest rates.
<P>	But the granddaddy of all myths has to be the myth of reefer madness.
 For the past 70- plus years, the government has tried, over and over again,
to convince us that marijuana must remain illegal because it poses an
unacceptable danger to the health and well-being of the nation.  Marijuana
kills brain cells; it causes formerly happy and industrious children to become
alienated, under-achieving teenagers; it's the gateway drug to cocaine, heroin,
and terrible, mind-bending drugs that underground chemists haven't even thought
of yet.  And to those parents who, based on their own youthful experimentation,
don't think marijuana is such a big deal, the government warns that the pot
they smoked in the 60's and 70's is nothing like the weed their kids are
smoking today.  It's ten, twenty, one hundred times more potent, we are told.
<P>	This week, marijuana became a campaign issue.  The Department of Health
and Human Resources released the results of its annual National Household
Drug Survey and evidently recent marijuana use among teens in on the rise,
from 5.3%  in 1992, to 10.9% in 1995.
<P>	The responses were predictable.  Administration officials wrung their
hands, "admitted" they had not done enough to fight teenage drug use, and
promised to do more -- much more.  Bob Dole blamed President Clinton for
this "national tragedy" and promised he would "make the drug war priority
No. 1 again."  In the meantime, Congress is waiting in the wings with more
anti- drug bills, as if we don't have enough repressive and ineffective laws
on the books already.
<P>	The truth may not matter to our political leaders, especially in an election
year.  But it should matter to the rest of us.  It should matter that, contrary
to what both Clinton and Dole are saying, the government's war on marijuana
has never been more vigorous.  Since 1992, when Clinton first took office,
there have been more than 1 million marijuana arrests, mostly for possession
-- the most marijuana arrests of any administration ever.  This Administration
has aggressively opposed legalizing marijuana for medical purposes, even
though the idea enjoys broad popular support.  It has pumped vast sums of
money into interdiction and eradication efforts, and supported such anti-civil
liberties measures as civil forfeiture and mandatory minimum sentencing laws.
 
<P>	Dole's accusation that Clinton has not done enough, and Clinton's mea
culpa, are fradulent -- a political sideshow.
<P>	And so, it turns out, are the scarey things the candidates say about
marijuana.  In November, the Lindesmith Center, a drug policy think tank
in New York, is publishing a new, 55- page book called "Marijuana Myths,
Marijuana Facts" by two scholars, John P. Morgan, M.D. and sociologist Lynn
Zimmer.   Morgan and Zimmer have painstakingly reviewed all of the scientific
literature about marijuana, and their book pokes huge holes in eighteen separate
marijuana myths.  For example:
<P>	Myth:  Marijuana is much more potent now than it used to be.
<P>	The truth:  In 1993, the last year for which figures were available,
the average percentage of THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) in
government-seized marijuana was 3.32 percent.  In 1975, samples of marijuana
tested by a large independent laboratory ranged in THC content from 2 to
5 percent, with some as high as 14%.
<P>	Myth:  Marijuana causes brain damage.
<P>	The truth:  This claim is based on a 20-year-old study in which two rhesus
monkeys were exposed to continuous massive doses of THC -- up to 200 times
the psychoactive dose for humans.  It has never been replicated, and there
is no evidence anywhere that marijuana users suffer brain damage.
<P>	Myth:  Marijuana is a "gateway" to the use of harder drugs.
<P>	The Truth:  It's true that most users of heroin, LSD and cocaine have
used marijuana (and alcohol, and tobacco).  But the vast majority of marijuana
users never use any other illegal drug.  In fact, as marijuana use increased
in the 60's and 70's, heroin use markedly declined.
<P>The truth?  Marijuana is a rather benign drug that isn't addictive and
causes no significant harm to even to long term users.  And kids know it,
even though more of them have been exposed to drug education programs than
at any other time in U.S. history.  
<P>	Why should we care if the government is lying to us about marijuana?
 
<P>	Because the lie sets the stage for a chain of  destructive events that
tear away at our most fundemental liberties.  It is used to justify criminal
prohibition and to lock people up for unconcionably long sentences for using
the "wrong" drug.  The lie is used to justify the seizure of people's homes,
cars and other personal property.  It is used to deny sick people legal access
to a drug which has recognized medicinal value.  And, of course, it is used
to get politicians elected.
<P>	So, as the election campaign heats up, be prepared for a major escalation
in anti-marijuana rhetoric and remember that most, if not all, of what is
said is pure bunk.

<TITLE> The ACLU on National Identification Cards</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>
<blockquote>
<img src="/graphics/libraryhdr.gif">
<CENTER><H1>National Identification Cards</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><EM>"Why Does the ACLU Oppose a <BR>
National I.D. Card System?"</EM></CENTER>
<P>
<STRONG>BACKGROUND</STRONG>
<BR>
Over the past decade various proposals for a tamper-proof national
identifier have cropped up repeatedly, usually in the context of
immigration policy. The notion of using some form of national
identification card has also surfaced in discussions of gun control and
health care reform. 
<P>
Proponents suggest that a tamper-proof worker identification card would
solve the problem of fraudulent work authorization documents. Some claim
an I.D. card would deter illegal immigration and halt job discrimination
resulting from the passage of the employer sanctions section of the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. 
<P>
This September, the Commission on Immigration Reform, headed by former
congresswoman Barbara Jordan, made recommendations to Congress on the U.S.
immigration system. One of the commission's proposals was a universal
national employee number, that would be linked to a national database. The
number would be required of all citizens and residents. 
<P>
The ACLU has vigorously opposed the creation of a national employee I.D.
number and/or card. It is a misplaced, superficial "quick fix" that poses
serious threats to our civil liberties and civil rights. 
<P>
<STRONG>IN BRIEF</STRONG>

<BR>This is an impractical and ineffective proposal that would only threaten
our right to privacy and foster new forms of discrimination. A national
I.D. card would be no more reliable than the documents a person would show
to obtain it and the cost to the American taxpayers just to issue the
cards would be at least $2.5 billion, according to the Social Security
Administration. 
<P>
The continuing recession in California has fueled the widespread tendency
for politicians to blame immigrants for our economic woes. The call for a
national I.D. card is just another example of tryingto sell a "quick fix"
for much more complex social and economic problems. Regardless of one's
views on immigration, a national identity card, with all its dangers, is
not the answer. 
<P>
Just as the original restrictions on the use of the Social Security card
have been all but eliminated, limits on a national I.D. number or card
would be ignored or legislated away. There would be an irresistible
temptation to use the data for purposes for which it was never intended,
including government surveillance. Former Senator Alan Cranston has
described the national I.D. card as "a primary tool of totalitarian
governments to restrict the freedom of their citizens." 
<P>
<STRONG>ACLU POLICY</STRONG>
<BR>
"The ACLU .... opposes the use of Social Security cards and other
governmentally issued documents as a condition of employment. Such a
practice, in effect, creates an `employment passport,' which results in a
universal identifier of all persons in the United States."   -- Policy #329
 <P>

<STRONG>ARGUMENTS, FACTS, QUOTES</STRONG>
 <BR>
The ACLU does not object to efforts to make current documents more fraud
or tamper-resistant as long as individual privacy is protected. The ACLU
has, however, consistently opposed proposals that would establish a single
document that serves as the sole form of employment identification for
citizens and residents. 
 <P>
Many Americans have an almost visceral reaction against the use -- and
abuse -- of technology for intrusive purposes. A national I.D. card poses
a grave threat to the civil liberties of all by creating a powerful tool
for abuse of privacy rights. The system could not work without a national
governmental database of every person in the U.S., with identifying
information subject to continual updating. The linkage of government
databases with corporate databases increases the likelihood that intimate
personal information -- credit histories, spending habits, unlisted
telephone numbers, voting, medical and employment histories -- could be
easily accessed without a person's knowledge. 
 <P>
A national I.D. card would essentially serve as an internal passport. It
would create an easy new tool for government surveillance and could be
used to target critics of the government, as has happened periodically
throughout our nation's history. While the Social Security Act originally
contained strict prohibitions against use of the Social Security card for
unrelated purposes, over the past 50 years those prohibitions have been
ignored or legislated into oblivion and restrictions on a national I.D.
card would follow the same path. In his seminal book, Databanks in a Free
Society, author Alan Westin wrote that "many dissenting and minority
groups in [American] society ... view the establishment of such an
identifier ... as a giant step toward tightening government control over
the citizen for repressive purposes." 
 <P>
The General Accounting Office (GAO) concluded in 1990 that employer
sanctions had resulted in widespread employment discrimination against
U.S. citizens and legal residents, with almost 20 percent of employers
found to be engaging in such practices. Rather than eliminating
discrimination, a national I.D. card would foster new forms of
disrimination and harassment of anyone perceived as looking or sounding
"foreign." Latinos, Asians, Caribbeans and other minorities would be the
likely targets of status and identity checks from police, banks,
merchants, landlords and others. Latino U.S. citizens are already
subjected to random searches at border checkpoints. Failure to carry a
national I.D. card would likely be viewed as a reason for search,
detention or arrest of minorities.  The stigma and humiliation of
constantly proving lawful status is unacceptable. 
<P>

<center><img align="right" src ="/graphics/actnow.gif"><font face="Arial" size="+2" color="#000080">Taxpayer Subsidies For Religious Schools</font></center>
<blockquote><font size = +2>T</font>
 he very first bill offered by Senate Republicans in the 105th Congress is S. 1, the so-called "Safe and Affordable Schools Act." At its core is a school voucher scheme that would use taxpayer dollars to fund religious schools. These vouchers, which are also at the top of the Christian Coalition's new legislative agenda, are being touted as "Hope and Opportunity Scholarships."</blockquote>
<center><font face="Arial" size="+2" color="#000080">Oppose This Legislation</font></center>
<p>
<img src = "/graphics/redstar.gif">At its very core, the school voucher scheme would force federal taxpayers to support religious beliefs and practices with which they may strongly disagree. At the heart of this proposal is the Christian Coalition's goal of merging government and religion and having public funds diverted to private and parochial schools.
<p>
<img src = "/graphics/redstar.gif">This legislation purports to help underprivileged youth in substandard public schools. But in reality, this proposal would abandon our local public schools. That's why groups that have traditionally advocated for improvement of public schools, such as the NAACP and the national PTA, oppose vouchers for parochial and private schools as do 61 percent of Americans surveyed in a recent Gallup poll.
<p>
<img src = "/graphics/redstar.gif">The proposed amount for vouchers in the last Congress was $3,000 per student. The median cost for a private school is $10,300 per year, meaning that private schools would still be out of reach of the poor. Thus, under the pretense of aiding the poor, voucher proponents are paving the way for their ultimate goal to subsidize religious education for wealthier families and leave poor students with no hope and no opportunity.

<P>November 17, 1996</P>
<H2>SCAPEGOATING IMMIGRANTS -- AGAIN</H2>
<P>Between 1890 and 1924, millions of people came to America from Eastern and
Southern Europe in search of a better life economically and a freer life
politically.  Most of them found what they sought, after much struggle and hard
work, or lived to see their children find it.  Today, tens of millions of
American citizens, perhaps even approaching a majority, are descendants of those
immigrants.  And so much of what we now regard as uniquely American -- our
music, our art, our theater, our films, our literature, our science, our Nobel
Prizes and our business success stories -- were produced by those immigrants and
their children and grandchildren.</P>
<P>But back in the 1920s, the majority didn't see it that way.  Immigrants from
Eastern and Southern Europe were seen as alien races -- yes, races -- and a
threat to what it meant to be American.  Many were said to be criminals seeking
to feed off hardworking Americans.  Almost no one saw the achievements that lay
ahead.</P>
<P>The government reflected this prejudice.  Between 1910 and 1920, the Palmer
Raids (named after U.S. Attorney General Mitchell Palmer) were responsible for
the deportation of thousands of immigrants -- seized suddenly from their beds or
jobs and deported without hearings, based on little more than prejudice and fear
of people who looked and sounded different.  And in 1924, Congress passed and
the President signed the National Origins Quota Act of 1924, which by design and
operation virtually eliminated immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe.</P>
<P>The conceded purpose of the Act was to preserve the racial and ethnic makeup
of the United States as it had existed in 1890.  There was no attempt to deny
this purpose or to sugarcoat it.  The day the Act became law, The New York Times
announced it with the following headline:  &quot;Chief aim . . . is to preserve
racial type as it exists here today.&quot;</P>
<P>The Act accomplished its goals by setting annual immigration quotas for each
country based on the percentage of the American population from that country in
the 1890 census.  The result in effect limited future immigration to people from
Northwestern Europe.  Not until 1965 -- in the midst of the civil rights
movement -- was a new immigration law passed that overturned the 1924 Act.</P>
<P>The 1924 Act passed because people were blinded by their prejudice and could
not see the richness and productivity that the early 20th century immigrants
would bring to American life and culture.  Racism prevailed, and the
Constitution was ignored.  People were denied entry based on their national
origin and those that were here were subjected to illegal treatment and
deportation without recourse to the courts.</P>
<P>Today, we are in the midst of another wave of anti-immigrant hysteria. 
Though today's prejudices are more subtle than the explicit racism of the 1920s,
many of the arguments heard now are similar to the ones that prevailed then:
that new immigrants are not as industrious as the old immigrants; that they are
not assimilating as well; that they will change the essential character of the
country; that they are coming in overwhelming numbers (actually, as a percentage
of the population, there are far fewer immigrants today than there were then);
that they are often criminals; and that they are unjustly benefitting from the
country's generosity.  At a time of unsettling and rapid social change mixed
with economic uncertainty and fear for the future, such arguments find receptive
ears, then as now.</P>
<P>Although we hear much talk about illegal immigrants, only about 150,000
immigrants actually enter the United States illegally each year.  Given the huge
perimeter of our national borders and the size of our population, that is not an
overwhelming amount, and the problem, if it is a problem, does not justify the
political hysteria it has generated.  But what really reveals the animus of our
elected officials in Washington are the laws they have recently passed that
punish and violate the rights of legal immigrants and their families, including
the children who have been born here and are, therefore, citizens.  Consider
three laws passed this year:</P>
<P>1.  The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act was passed by
Congress and signed by President Clinton this past April.  This law was
ballyhooed by leaders of both parties as a response to the Oklahoma City bombing
in 1995.  But much of this law had absolutely nothing to do with combatting
terrorism, a fact consciously kept from the public.</P>
<P>For example, this law included a provision that imposed mandatory detention
and deportation on longtime permanent legal residents if they had been convicted
of any drug offense at any time in the past.  This included convictions for
simple possession of marijuana (except in very small amounts).  Thus, a person
who may have arrived here legally as a child many years ago, married a citizen
and who has several citizen children, and who has worked and paid taxes for 20
years, can be summarily arrested, detained and deported for a marijuana
possession bust 25 years ago.  Moreover, all this can be done without any
opportunity to challenge the deportation in court because the law conveniently
included a provision eliminating the right to judicial review.  People have
already been caught in this web of cruelty.  What this sort of law has to do
with combatting terrorism, or reducing illegal immigration, we have not been
told.  Perhaps those of you who are Republicans ought to ask Mr. Dole and Mr.
Gingrich why they pushed this law through Congress, and those of you who are
Democrats might want to ask Mr. Clinton why he signed it.</P>
<P>2.  The Welfare Reform Act was passed and signed by President Clinton this
past September.  It categorically eliminated both Supplemental Social Security
Income and Aid to Families for Dependent Children for all legal permanent
residents.  Under this law, an estimated 500,000 elderly and disabled
immigrants, who entered the country legally, never violated any law or
immigration requirement, who worked for years and paid taxes, contributed to the
economy and in every respect played by the rules, will now have their essential,
life-sustaining benefits taken away.  Not content with this piece of designer
cruelty, the new law also authorizes the states to enact local laws denying
state-funded benefits to legal permanent residents.</P>
<P>Again, you might want to ask the politicians you voted for why they would
want to do such things in your name.</P>
<P>3.  Finally, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act
was buried in a comprehensive budget bill and enacted on September 30 with
little public attention and virtually no public debate.  Yet this Act amounts to
one of the most sweeping revisions of the law governing the powers of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to determine admissions,
deportations and detention.  This law not only reiterated the authority to
deport longtime legal residents for minor crimes, it also restricted
humanitarian relief and virtually eliminated the opportunity to apply for asylum
for persons arriving here without papers (a common and understandable phenomenon
when one flees a persecutorial government).  Worst of all, this bill enacted
unprecedented restrictions on the power of federal courts to review the legality
of individual deportation orders, to issue injunctions against illegal INS
policies or practices and to determine the constitutionality of INS actions. 
Aside from what this law does to legal immigrants, it represents an attack upon
the rule of law itself and the principle of independent courts.</P>
<P>Were the politicians you voted for acting in your interest when they enacted
such a law?</P>
<P>Immigration policies during the 1920s are now universally regarded as a
descent into hysteria, prejudice, unconstitutionality and cruelty.  The
politicians responsible for those policies and practices are a blot on
fundamental American principles of fairness and equality under the law. 
Someday, someday soon I hope, today's politicians will be similarly seen by the
majority of American citizens.</P>

<TITLE>Visions of Liberty #18: REFLECTIONS ON SKIN COLOR AND THE PERSISTENCE OF
RACIAL DISADVANTAGE</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="/graphics/vision.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P><I>by Ira Glasser, ACLU Executive Director</I></P>
<P>December 8, 1996</P>
<H2>HOW LONG?  VERY LONG: REFLECTIONS ON SKIN COLOR AND THE PERSISTENCE OF
RACIAL DISADVANTAGE</H2>
<P>Last month, the voters of California approved an initiative ending all forms
of affirmative action.  A few weeks later, a coalition of civil rights groups,
including the American Civil Liberties Union, obtained a preliminary injunction
in federal court blocking the implementation of the ban.  At this writing, the
case is still pending and its ultimate disposition unknown.  Meanwhile, the
debate over the persistence of racial disadvantage and the need to remedy it
continues.</P>
<P>Those who support at least some forms of affirmative action do so because
they believe that drastic remedies are still required to provide equal
opportunity and to overcome the substantial disadvantage, including outright
prejudice, still suffered by Americans of darker skin color.</P>
<P>Those who oppose all forms of affirmative action do so because they believe
that such remedies are no longer required, that the playing field is now level
and that disadvantages based on skin color, created and embedded in our laws and
customs for over two centuries, have been largely eliminated during the past
four decades.  This attitude was best reflected in a poll of delegates to the
Republican convention in San Diego last summer, which revealed that 60 percent
of those delegates believed that equal opportunity was now a fact and that civil
rights laws prohibiting racial discrimination in employment, education and
housing were no longer necessary and could be safely repealed.</P>
<P>Who is right?</P>
<P>Certainly, much progress has been made in the last forty years.  The
formalities of racial bias have been eliminated.  Jim Crow laws have been
abolished.  Segregation is no longer legally permitted, and civil rights laws,
enforced by the courts, have in fact opened up avenues of access to jobs,
education and housing that were unimaginable back in the fifties.</P>
<P>But it is also true that many of those avenues of opportunity remain narrow
and constricted, available in fact only to the relatively few.  The persistence
of prejudice based on skin color remains and, even beyond outright prejudice,
the profound disadvantages created by centuries of slavery, terror and legalized
subjugation have proved to be more difficult to erase than many of us imagined
during the hopeful sixties.</P>
<P>Redemption for two hundred years of social sins will, it appears, require
more than forty years and more than the abolition of formal inequality, which
was the great accomplishment of the civil rights movement of the fifties and
sixties.</P>
<P>What does the evidence tell us?</P>
<UL>
<LI> In November, shortly after Californians voted to end affirmative action
remedies, a tape recording of an executive meeting at Texaco revealed senior
managers engaged in crude and overtly racist conversations regarding their black
employees.  What was remarkable about this tape recording was that it became
publicly available and was widely reported.   Was the Texaco incident
aberrational?  Almost certainly not.  There is ample reason to believe that
similar &quot;private&quot; conversations take place unrecorded and unrevealed
throughout corporate America.  Indeed, at about the same time, similar attitudes
and conversations were revealed to have taken place at the Shell Oil Company. 
These attitudes and the persistence of bias they reflect, help explain why so
many blacks employed by such companies are repeatedly passed over for promotion
and advancement, despite excellent work records.  Bias does, in fact, persist,
though it is less obvious and open than it was 40 years ago.
</LI>
<LI> During the same period, two articles appeared in medical journals
documenting the severe health disadvantages suffered by American blacks.  The
first, in the October issue of the American Journal of Public Health, studied
blood pressure differences between 4,000 black and white young adults in four
cities.  It has long been known that blacks generally are more susceptible to
high blood pressure, a silent and deadly disease, but this new study suggested
that at least some African-American blood pressure problems are related to the
stress caused by discrimination rather than to diet or genetic factors. 
Although this study is more suggestive than definitive, it is consistent with
other, similar studies.
</LI></UL>
<P>The second recent study was published by The New England Journal of
Medicine, one of the oldest and most respected journals in the field.  This
study found dramatic differences in life expectancy.  Fifteen-year-old
African-American boys in Harlem, for example, have less chance of reaching the
age of 45 than white boys do of reaching 65.  And a survey of mortality rates
for men and women between 15 and 64 in 16 different regions found excessive
numbers of premature deaths among blacks as compared to whites.  Even when death
due to homicide and AIDS, both of which occur disproportionately among blacks,
are removed, there was still a &quot;tremendous excess of premature mortality&quot;
among blacks, according to the lead researcher.</P>
<P>The leading causes of such premature deaths is cardiovascular disease and,

secondarily, cancer.  Persistent and severe stress related to the circumstances
of life in what Kenneth Clark once called the dark ghettos of our inner cities,
was suggested by the lead researcher as an explanation.  Inadequate and late

treatment of disease, once it develops, compounds the problem.  The result is
early disability and death, leaving dependents adrift and in trouble.  And so
the cycle continues.</P>
<P>These findings, combined with the often invisible persistence of bias,
require a remedial policy response if we mean finally to have justice, fairness
and equal opportunity in this country.  What we did to African-Americans for
more than two centuries has not yet yielded to the remedies invented and
implemented in recent decades.  More is required.  Yet less seems to be the
order of the day.</P>
<P>Poor people are being cut off from minimal income support without any
serious effort being made to create jobs, train people to perform them and
provide day care to make it possible for them to take jobs.  And the movement to
abolish civil rights remedies for discrimination is growing, despite the
evidence provided by the Texaco and Shell Oil revelations.</P>
<P>The civil rights movement of the sixties depended on the courage of
African-Americans who organized resistance to racial disadvantages and upon
whites of good will who were morally committed to redemptive remedies.</P>
<P>We need that combination again, badly.</P>

"Express Yourself: The First Amendment," a unique interactive
software program for use on Macintosh compatible computers,
explores First Amendment issues as they relate to students today. 
The educational software is a tool to enable and empower young
people to learn more about their rights and then use them.  A
diverse team of students, teachers, activists, lawyers, and
constitutional scholars, brought together by the American Civil
Liberties Union of Northern California, shaped the program.  Red
Dot Interactive, a San Francisco-based team of interactive
software designers, utilized video, animation, music, graphics,
and text to bring this lively and innovative learning tool to
life.
<p>
The program was created by the ACLU-NC's Howard A. Friedman
First Amendment Education Project, a special five-year effort
focusing on student's rights.  The goal of the Friedman Project
is to work with high school students and teachers on issues
involving freedom of expression; freedom of the press; rights to
associate, assemble and petition the government; and freedom of
religion.  The project organizes special conferences, develops
materials and sends speakers into school classrooms in Northern
California.
<p>
"Express Yourself: The First Amendment," is available for download 
and is also distributed on a 3 1/2" diskette for
a cost of $10.00. Express Yourself is FREE to students only.  To order or

<P>December 15, 1996</P>
<H2>Which Morality? Freedom versus Authority</H2>
<P>Today, a struggle between two competing visions of morality is taking place
in America -- one based on freedom, the other on authoritarianism.  A recent
edition of The New York Times carried two articles that, when read together, are
poignant and graphic reminders of just how different these moral compasses are.
 </P>
<P>The first, entitled &quot;Love at the Top ...&quot;, told the sweet story of
a late-in-life love affair between Nelson Mandela, the president of South
Africa, and Gra&ccedil;a Machel, the widow of President Samora M. Machel of
Mozambique.  &quot;I thought that part of my life was over&quot;, said Mrs.
Machel, &quot;and here I am in love.&quot;  </P>
<P>The couple, however, does not plan to marry.  They will spend two weeks a
month together, but continue their life work:  Mandela in South Africa, creating
a society based on democracy, justice and racial reconciliation to South Africa,
and Machel in Mozambique, heading a U.N. study on the impact of war on children.
 The decision not to marry, said Mandela, was hers.  &quot;I like being called
Mrs. Machel,&quot; she has said.  &quot;It is my way of keeping my husband
alive.&quot;</P>
<P>Some would consider living together without benefit of marriage an immoral
act.  But in my view, Mandela and Machel's central roles in establishing civic
virtue in their troubled lands is what defines their morality, not the decisions
they make in the context of their personal life together.</P>
<P>The second article appeared just a few pages later. Entitled &quot;Stoning
of Afghan Adulterers,&quot; the story told of two people in Afghanistan who,
like Mr. Mandela and Mrs. Machel, were in love, living together, and unmarried. 
When they were discovered by the ruling Taliban religious movement, they were
arrested and publicly stoned  to death.  The story was not pretty:  the man and
woman were buried vertically up to their chests and then people threw  stones at
their heads from close range until they were dead.   According to the article,

one died in ten minutes; the other suffered for considerably longer.</P>
<P>The authorities were chillingly unapologetic about the incident.  Mohammed
Wali, the Muslim cleric who led the investigation that resulted in the stoning,
said: &quot;When I see this kind of thing, I am very happy, because it means
that the rule of Islam is being implemented.&quot;  Mullah Mohammed Hassan, one
of the most powerful clerics in Afghanistan, said that the threat of severe
punishment would end sinful activities like homosexuality just as it had ended
adultery in the village where the offending couple were murdered. If Mandela and
Machel had been living in Afghanistan, would they too have been stoned to death?
 Very possibly.</P>
<P>How should public morality be defined?  By the degree of democracy, fairness
and racial justice  reflected in the laws and processes of a government?  Or by
the intensely personal, consensual behavior of individuals?  </P>
<P>In theocracies like Afghanistan, public morality has nothing to do with
democracy or the protection of personal freedom.  Instead, it is defined by the
extent to which personal behavior conforms to a rigidly imposed religious code. 
 And transgressors are severely punished if caught. </P>
<P>In America, the Constitution protects, or should protect, such personal
decisions from government interference or punishment. In America, public
morality means what it now means in South Africa:  democracy, freedom, justice
and fairness.  Freedom means that the state may not enforce my personal
standards on you.  And religious freedom means that the beliefs of some may not
be imposed through law on others who do not share them. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, this vision of morality based on freedom is not shared by
everyone in America.   We have our share of merchants of virtue, bent on forcing
their beliefs on everyone else.  Take Jesse Helms.  He is sponsoring a
constitutional amendment to restore government-sponsored prayers in public
schools because he thinks it will enhance his authoritarian brand of public
morality.  </P>
<P>During the 1950s, of course,  many states did impose daily prayers in public
schools, and the states that did so the most were in the deep South.  In
Mississippi, a larger proportion of schoolchildren were praying every day than
in any other state.  Was Mississippi a moral state in those days?  </P>
<P>I don't think so.  Racial segregation and subjugation were enforced, often
by brutal, state-sanctioned violence and terror.  This was the state where
14-year old Emmett Till was lynched for looking at a white woman; where three
civil rights workers -- James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner --
were murdered by a sheriff  and buried in a ditch because they helped black
citizens register to vote.  And Mississippi was the state where James Meredith
was shot because he was the first black to attend the University of Mississippi.</P>
<P>Jesse Helms preaches from the Senate floor about public morality.  But in
the early 1960s, when Helms was a disc jockey in North Carolina, he regularly
attacked the lunch counter sit-ins that were the vanguard of the civil rights
movement.  The movement for racial justice was the greatest moral struggle of
this generation.  But where was Senator Helms in that moral struggle?  And who
is he to preach to us now about morality?</P>
<P>If the 1950s were years of public immorality, the 1960s changed much of
that.  Racial segregation was vanquished, at least formally.  The seeds of
women's equality were planted.  The First Amendment triumphed over McCarthyism. 
And, in 1969, the gay rights movement was born.  The 1960s were, in fact, years
of moral redemption. Those who never lifted a finger to oppose the public
immorality of the 1950s do not have the moral standing today to tell us how to
live our lives.</P>
<P>As between South Africa and Afghanistan, I'll take South Africa -- and the
vision of morality reflected in the American Bill of Rights.</P>

<P>October 20, 1996</P>
<H1>Two Nations, One Justice </H1>
<P>On October 11, Magnus Malan, South Africa's former Minister of Defense and
15 co-defendants were found not guilty of murder by the presiding judge.  They
were accused of plotting to arm and train the assassination squad that attacked
the home of an African National Congress member in 1987 and killed 13 people,
most of them women and children. </P>
<P>Following the acquittal, President Nelson Mandela said he &quot;fully
accepted&quot; the judgment of the court.  If South Africa wished to build a
democracy, Mr. Mandela said, &quot;then we must respect the institutions of
government, and the judiciary is a very important arm of government.&quot;</P>
<P>This defense by Mr. Mandela of the independence of the courts stands in
sharp contrast to the sniping at judges which has become the bipartisan
political sport of the moment in America.  </P>
<P>Last spring, President Clinton attacked a federal trial judge in New York
for a ruling he had made on a motion involving the legality of a search; Bob
Dole soon joined in the fun.  Weeks later, New York's Mayor Giuliani and
Governor Pataki attacked a state court judge who had made a decision that they
didn't like.</P>
<P>Nelson Mandela had more reason than most to find the acquittal of Malan and
his co-defendants excruciating.  After all, he spent most of his adult life in
prison at the hands of the apartheid regime and was the head of the African
National Congress, whose sympathizers were slaughtered in that incident. </P>
<P>President Mandela's searing personal experiences might understandably have
led him to attack the court when he learned that his tormentors had been
acquitted.  But as a man of principle, he rose above that impulse and defended
the importance of independent courts in a democracy.</P>
<P>I wish I could say the same of political leadership here in the United
States, where the idea of independent courts was established when America was
invented over 200 years ago.  But at the same time that we are witnessing the
profoundly moving birth and evolution of democracy in South Africa, we are also
witnessing unprecedented attacks on the 205-year-old tradition of independence,

scope and power of America's federal courts -- the bedrock of our constitutional

form of government. </P>
<P>In 1996 alone, Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, a series of
laws that reduced or eliminated the ability of federal courts to remedy
violations of legal rights. </P>
<P>The first of these was swept into law as a virtual footnote to a huge
appropriations bill, the so-called Prison Litigation Reform Act.  The Act
stripped the federal courts of much of their power to correct even the most
egregious prison conditions and prohibited prison officials from settling
lawsuits by agreeing to make changes in unconstitutional prison conditions.
There was so little opposition to the Act that it never went through hearings or
faced separate votes in either the House or the Senate. </P>
<P>That action set the stage for the crippling of the &quot;Great Writ of
Liberty,&quot; the right of habeas corpus.  This ancient procedure, first
established in England in the 17th Century and later included in Article I,
Section 9 of the American Constitution, was designed to allow people convicted
in state courts to seek federal court review of the constitutionality of their
convictions.</P>
<P>Under the new law, federal courts are required to defer to state court
decisions <I>even when those decisions are clearly wrong</I>. And all too
often, they are.  Since 1973, 54 people sentenced to death have been released
from prison after evidence of their innocence was uncovered.  None of these 54
people would be alive today if they didn't have the right to habeas corpus
review.   </P>
<P>President Clinton also signed several laws that bar or dilute judicial
review in cases involving immigrants, including long-term legal residents and
political refugees, and undocumented aliens fleeing persecution and seeking
asylum.</P>
<P>Had these laws been in effect in 1994, for example, a young woman fleeing
genital mutilation in Togo and seeking asylum here could have been deported --
to face torture -- without independent court review of an immigration employee's
denial of her claim of asylum.</P>
<P>And just hours after the new immigration law went into effect, Attorney
General Janet Reno was in court, attempting to use wording in the law to dismiss
major class-action lawsuits by thousands of undocumented immigrants who say they
were wrongly disqualified from a 1980's-era INS amnesty program. </P>
<P>Another new law strips Legal Services lawyers who receive any federal
funding of their authority to represent poor people in cases involving abortion,
immigration and prisoners' rights, even if they use private funds.  The law also
explicitly bars Legal Services lawyers from challenging the constitutionality of
any aspect of the new welfare law.  Thus, those directly injured by the welfare
bill are in effect banned from challenging its constitutionality.</P>
<P>Because this interference with the independence of the courts targets
unpopular and politically powerless groups -- immigrants, prisoners, welfare
recipients and the poor and disabled -- few cared when these laws were enacted.</P>
<P>But it is important for us all to understand that what Congress and the
President did to our society's most vulnerable can be done to the rest of us. 
If the right to challenge constitutional violations can be removed from anyone,
it can be removed from everyone.</P>
<P>As Judge Learned Hand, one of the leading American judges of the 20th
Century, known for his judicial restraint, once said: &quot;Liberty lies in the
hearts of men and women.  When it dies there, no Constitution, no law, no court
can save it.&quot;</P>
<P>Nelson Mandela kept liberty in his heart when he was confined on Robbins
Island by a repressive government regime, and he kept it in his heart when the
judiciary of his own democratic government acquitted some of his oppressors.</P>
<P>These two countries, the United States and South Africa, today share common
ideals of a democratic nation founded on principles of justice for all.  But as
one nation comes into being, the other seems to be allowing serious erosions in
one of democracy's most important features -- access to independent courts.</P>

<P>October 13, 1996</P>

<H3>ENDING DEMOCRACY AS WE KNEW IT: A RADICAL PROPOSAL FROM CLINTON AND
DOLE</H3>

<P>The current presidential and vice presidential debates, and the exclusion
of Ross Perot and his vice presidential candidate from those debates, brings
other campaigns to mind, and sets me to wondering what is becoming of our
democracy.</P>

<P>In 1968, the two leading candidates for president were Richard Nixon
and Hubert Humphrey. But there was a third candidate that year named George
Wallace, who charged that there wasn't &quot;a dime's worth of difference&quot;
between Nixon and Humphrey. He may or may not have been right, but millions
of Americans agreed with him. Wallace, a longtime governor of Alabama and
a major political figure, wanted the chance to convince other Americans.
After all, isn't that what elections in a democracy are all about?</P>

<P>Not everyone thought so. When Wallace came to New York City and tried
to rent Shea Stadium for a political rally, Mayor John Lindsay barred him
from doing so, because his views were not shared by most New Yorkers. The
First Amendment guaranteed Wallace the right to speak, but Mayor Lindsay
arranged things so that not many would hear him.</P>

<P>The New York Civil Liberties Union thought that was unconstitutional,
and sued in Wallace's behalf. We won, and Wallace got to speak in Shea
Stadium. He got a lot of votes that year, including some in New York, but
he didn't persuade enough people and finished a poor third in the election.</P>

<P>Still, his ideas received a wide hearing, which is one of the purposes
of an election in a democracy. Elections are not only a vehicle for choosing
our temporary leaders; they are also an important vehicle for conducting
great public debates about policies and practices that affect our lives.
Although such debates take place at all times, it is during election periods
that those debates are most focused and when citizens pay the most attention.</P>

<P>Often, ideas voiced by candidates who don't initially attract enough
adherents are able to triumph in subsequent elections. That is why it is
important to allow many views to compete during an election campaign and
not limit the debate to those views that happen to be dominant at the time.
In Wallace's case, his views eventually formed the basis of Nixon's famous
Southern Strategy, which transformed politics in this country by delivering
the South to the Republicans, something thought to be impossible 30 years
ago.</P>

<P>In similar fashion, the many unsuccessful presidential campaigns of
the Socialist Norman Thomas gave voice to many programmatic ideas that
found their way into the New Deal programs of Franklin Delano Roosevelt
and, in some cases -- social security, for instance -- into the unalterable
fabric of American life.</P>

<P>And in 1948, the arguments of four candidates -- Harry Truman, Thomas
E. Dewey, Henry Wallace and Strom Thurmond -- foreshadowed major developments
in today's political landscape even though neither Wallace nor Thurmond
stood much chance of winning at the time.</P>

<P>Below the presidential level, the rise of the Conservative Party about
a quarter-century ago and its willingness to run candidates to the right
of the Republican Party attracted enough adherents over time to transform
the Republican Party into its conservative image, even though Conservative
Party candidates virtually never won elections.</P>

<P>All of this comes to mind when I consider the implications of excluding
Ross Perot from the presidential debates. Mr. Perot has the right to speak,
and the money to buy microphones. But the two major candidates and their
political parties, aided and abetted by the Federal Election Commission
and the Internal Revenue Service, have conspired to keep Perot away from
his most relevant audience. Perot, like third-party candidates before him,
thinks there isn't that much difference between Clinton and Dole. On many
issues, he is right.</P>

<P>Clinton and Dole have much the same policy on drugs -- not a dime's
worth of difference there. And they represent much the same policy on crime
control, the death penalty, immigration policy, welfare policy and foreign
policy. I am not suggesting that despite these essential similarities,
there are not good reasons to choose one candidate over the other. (Abortion
rights and tax policy provide two examples where there are sharp differences,
for example). But I am suggesting that these two candidates essentially
agree on many important issues and that elections ought to provide the
opportunity for alternative ideas to surface and be discussed.</P>

<P>If alternative ideas are not given a fair opportunity to compete, how
can citizens make up their minds and determine for themselves what policies
are in their best interests?</P>

<P>Now I do not know if Ross Perot has anything different to offer on these
important issues. But that, of course, is the point. </P>

<P>Yes, the two leading candidates are free to decide that they want to
debate each other without the discomfort of confronting other viewpoints.
They have a right to do that. But they don't have a right to do it with
public funds or with the active complicity of government agencies. And
that is exactly what has happened.</P>

<P>Under our campaign finance laws, corporations are forbidden from making
financial contributions to federal campaigns. But the Federal Election
Commission -- a government agency -- has granted an exemption from this
prohibition and allowed electoral debates to be financed by tax- exempt
not-for-profit organizations that conduct debates in a nonpartisan manner.</P>

<P>So the Democrats and Republicans got together and created such a not-for-profit
corporation called the Commission on Presidential Debates. They applied
to the Internal Revenue Service for a tax-exemption, claiming to be a nonpartisan
voter education organization, and the IRS granted it. Then, bypassing the
normal ban on corporate contributions to federal election campaigns, they
successfully solicited corporate contributions to finance the debates.
Moreover, these corporate contributions were now tax-deductible, which
meant that all American citizens helped pay for them. </P>

<P>The key rationale for this end run around the campaign finance law is
that the Commission on Presidential Debates is nonpartisan. But it isn't.
It's bipartisan. Nonpartisan means the absence of any favoritism to any
candidate. Bipartisan means favoritism to two candidates at the expense
of all others. This distinction -- an important one -- is the basis of
Perot's lawsuit against the Commission on Presidential Debates.</P>

<P>The basis on which the Commission has excluded Perot is a dangerous
one. It would be legitimate, in my view, for the Commission to say that
only bona fide candidates will be included in the debate. Who is a bona
fide candidate would be determined by reasonable, objective criteria. For
example, only candidates who have satisfied the ballot requirements in
all 50 states would be included. This would eliminate truly fringe candidates
and require that the price of admission was a viable candidacy nationwide.
But that is not what the Commission has done. If that criterion were used,
then Perot would have been included and the Commission would have been
operating in the nonpartisan way it said it would when it applied to the
IRS.</P>

<P>Instead, the Commission excluded Perot on the ground that he had no
reasonable chance to win. This is a curious criterion in a democracy. It
means that people with different ideas that have not yet gained wide support
will be denied the opportunity to gain that support by being denied access
to the relevant audience. Applied years ago, it would have excluded all
minor-party candidates and robbed America of many policies they first voiced
and which only later gained wide acceptance. In fact, the two leading candidates
have conspired to rig the debate in order to insure their dominance and
have falsely claimed to be nonpartisan in order to gain access to money
to which they are not by law entitled.</P>

<P>Utilizing the same criterion applied to Perot -- the polls show he can't
win so let's not allow Americans to listen to him -- we might as well exclude
Dole too. After all, the polls show he can't win either. Should Clinton,
therefore, be allowed to exclude Dole and speak alone? Similarly, should
Lyndon Johnson have been allowed to exclude Barry Goldwater? Could Richard
Nixon have excluded George McGovern? Could Ronald Reagan have excluded
Walter Mondale? Why bother with debate when the polls have settled the
issue?</P>

<P>This, of course, is the opposite of democracy. Americans would in fact
be outraged if government agencies gave favored status to only one leading
candidate. We would say we were becoming a one-party state. We should be
equally upset at the prospect of becoming a two-party state, where only
those who currently wield power are allowed to speak broadly.</P>

<P>There is more at stake here than who wins the next election.</P>

<CENTER><H1>Constitutional Amendment on School Prayer or Moment of Silence</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<STRONG>BACKGROUND</STRONG>
<br>
Surprising even his staunchest supporters with the swiftness of his
action, the House Speaker-elect, Newt Gingrich, this week announced his
intention to push immediately for adoption of his proposal to amend the
U.S. Constitution "relating to voluntary school prayer."  The Gingrich
proposal states: 
<P>
    "Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to prohibit
individual or group prayer in public schools or other public institutions. 
No person shall be required by the United States or by any State to
participate in prayer.  Neither the United States nor any State shall
compose the words of any prayer to be said in public schools." 
<P>
In spite of the caveats in the last two sentences, if adopted the
amendment would allow public officials, including teachers, to dictate
how, when and where school children and others should pray, thus
undermining one of the core values of the First Amendment: the complete
freedom of religious conscience through the nonestablishment of religion. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly said that officially organized
prayer is coercive in a school environment, even when designated as
"voluntary." 
<P>
A constitutional amendment requires the approval of two-thirds majorities
in both houses of Congress and then of the legislatures of three-quarters
of the states.  Gingrich has announced his plans to hold public hearings
around the country this winter and spring -- presumably in locations
thought to be most receptive to the idea. He hopes to have a vote on the
issue by July 1. 
<P>
President Clinton, apparently concluding from the election results that he
must appease the new Republican majority, caved in almost immediately. 
First, he announced that he was open to working with Congressional
Republicans on a school prayer amendment.  The next day, the
Administration said the President had been misunderstood, and that what he
had in mind was a federal statute permitting "moments of silence" in the
schools.  Such a statute would, however, be susceptible to constitutional
challenge.  At best, it is unnecessary since teachers already have the
authority to ask their students to be quiet.  At worst, it is organized
prayer by stealth, as recognized by the Supreme Court in its decision in
Wallace v. Jaffree (1985) in which the Court struck down Alabama's moment
of silence law. 
<P>
The mindless notion that serious social problems can be solved by prayer
in schoolrooms, instead of by thoughtful analysis and sufficient
resources, appeals to no one but the radical religious right.  Should it
actually pass, a constitutional amendment on school prayer would mark the
first time in our nation's history that the original Bill of Rights would
be amended -- a striking departure from traditional American values that
would set a dangerous precedent. 
<P>
<STRONG>IN BRIEF</STRONG>
<br>
<UL>
<LI>Newt Gingrich is playing politics with something sacrosanct: each
American's right to decide whether, when, where, how and with whom to
pray. 
<P>
<LI>We do not need a school prayer amendment. Every child in the United
States already has the right to pray in school on a voluntary basis --
it's called the First Amendment.  For more than 200 years, it has worked
so well that in spite of tremendous religious diversity, we have more
religious liberty in this country than anywhere else on earth.  That
diversity would be endangered, not enhanced, by an amendment that would
promote organized school prayer. 
<P>
<li>Why are conservatives, who say they want to get the government off our
backs, trying to interfere with something as personal and private as
religious conviction? The truly traditional American value is the freedom
to pursue any religion, or no religion, without government interference or
coercion. 
<P>
<LI>This proposal is already creating just the kind of divisiveness that the
framers of the Constitution were seeking to prevent when they adopted the
First Amendment. 
<P>
<LI>Leave the Bill of Rights alone. If the school prayer amendment is
adopted, it will be the first time in our history that the original Bill
of Rights has been altered.  The Bill of Rights is supposed to protect our
fundamental liberties from political winds. It reflects our deepest values
and most traditional beliefs.  Once we start playing politics with the
Constitution, there's no telling where it will stop. 
</uL>
<P>
<STRONG>ACLU POLICY</STRONG>
<br>
Opposition to school-sponsored prayer is a bedrock principle for the
American Civil Liiberties Union.  As national board policy #81(a) states
in part: "The ACLU believes that any program of religious indoctrination
-- direct or indirect -- in the public schools or by use of public
resources is a violation of the constitutional principle of separation of
church and state and must be opposed." 
<P>
The policy states further (#81(b)) that the ACLU "opposes the infusion of
other types of religious practices and standards into the public schools.
These include such practices as baccalaureate exercises in the form of
religious services, prayer meetings at athletic events, the taking of a
religious census of pupils ... and the profession of religious observance
or belief as a consideration in the evaluation and promotion of teachers."
[1932, 1962]
<P>
<STRONG>ARGUMENTS, FACTS, QUOTES</STRONG>
<br>
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof."  With these words, the framers of
the Constitution established one of the central principles of American
government -- that religious liberty can flourish only when the state
leaves religion alone. 
<P>
Under the Gingrich amendment, public officials would be authorized to
indoctrinate impressionable young people into an officially endorsed
religion.  What is tyranny, if not that?  Children, who are required to
attend school by law, should not be placed in the position of having to
choose between pressures from their teachers and peers and their parents'
instructions on religious practice.  Where official school prayer has been
permitted, the result has not been pretty: Documentation is abundant of
non-conforming students being called "little athiests" by their teachers,
being beaten up or subjected to taunts and classroom jokes.  This
amendment would breed religious intolerance. 
<P>
Fifty years of Supreme Court jurisprudence has maintained this "wall of
separation between Church and State" so that the United States is a model
of religious freedom for the world. The fundamental principle behind the
Supreme Court's rulings has been that public schools may not take sides in
matters of religion and may not endorse a particular religious perspective
or any religion at all. 
<P>
As the Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette
in 1943: 
<P>
<dl>
<dd><EM>"The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects
from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the
reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal
principles to be applied by the courts.<P> 
One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free
press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may
not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections." </EM>
</dl>
<P>
The framers made it difficult to amend the Constitution precisely because
of our "checks and balances" form of government. Should the Bill of Rights
actually be amended, it will be the first time in American history. And
unlike the effort to pass an Equal Rights Amendment, which we supported,
the school prayer amendment would remove an existing right, rather than
confer a right on an unprotected group. 
<P>
Proponents of a school prayer amendment claim reintroducing prayer will
check the country's" declining moral values." Some, like former Secretary
of Education William Bennett blame the 1962 decision, Engel v. Vitale,
banning official prayer from public schools, for everything from low SAT
scores to high teenage pregnancy rates. But many educators and other
experts tell us that these problems flow from the enormous and increasing
gulf in wealth and opportunity and education, between the richest and
poorest people in our society.  A one-minute prayer or moment of silence
in school everyday will do nothing to change that.
<P>

<P><I>by Ira Glasser, Executive Director, American Civil Liberties Union</I>
</P>
<P>September 22, 1996</P>
<H2>A Tale of Two Centuries</H2>
<P>A few months ago, a Republican-dominated Congress combined with a Democratic
president to fulfill a 1992 campaign promise &quot;to end welfare as we know it.&quot;
 The opponents of this legislation bitterly attacked it.  Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, a nationally-recognized expert on social welfare policy, denounced the
new law in especially strong terms:  &quot;...we are doing mad things.  The
premise of this legislation is that the behavior of certain adults can be
changed by making the lives of their children as wretched as possible....  We
are putting those children at risk with absolutely no evidence that this radical
idea has even the slightest chance of success.&quot;</P>
<P>But those who supported the law claimed that it would help poor people. 
Poor people, they argued, had been weakened by the habits of dependency, had
lost their incentive to work and had become uncompetitive in  the labor market. 
The welfare system itself, it was argued, had become a cause of poverty.  Remove
the crutches of public support and the lame will learn how to walk again.  They
will regain the incentive to work, restore their own vitality and with it the
nation's economic strength.  </P>
<P>Those who opposed this legislation were all for the idea that most welfare
recipients who are able to work would be better off if they had decent jobs. 
But they do not believe that enough decent jobs exist.  They point out that
large economic changes have occurred that have basically created surplus labor
that the American economy no longer needs.  (Moreover, even to the extent that
such jobs are available, women with dependent children would require both job
training and child care in order to be able to take available jobs; however,
neither job training nor child care is provided by the new law.)  </P>
<P>New technological developments have created growing needs for highly
skilled, highly educated workers.  At the same time, the sharp decline of
manufacturing jobs has reduced the need for workers with less education and few
skills.  This trend has been accelerated by the expansion of a global economy
across national borders, as manufacturers increasingly seek lower labor costs by
shifting their plants to underdeveloped countries.  Thus, for example, the boom
in expensive sneakers has been fueled by American manufacturers shifting their
operations to underdeveloped Asian economies where they can increase their
profit margins by utilizing workers who can be paid a fraction of what it would
cost to pay American workers.</P>
<P>These trends have created huge wage disparities in America between highly
educated and less educated Americans.  In 1979, for example, young white males
with at least a college education earned, on the average, 30 percent more than
young, white males with only a high school education.  By 1989, that gap had
dramatically widened to 79 percent, while the cost of housing, education and
medical care soared.  The result has been a steep decline in the standard of
living for many less educated Americans because the American economy no longer
has a need for what they are qualified to do.</P>
<P>Even for those families who have managed to keep up, they have done so only
because of the combined wages of husband and wife.  A dominant economic reality
today is that for many families two wage earners are now required to earn what
not too long ago one could earn, in terms of purchasing power.</P>
<P>Few Americans blame themselves for these changes in the American economy. 
They know something has gone wrong, and they know it isn't their fault:  they
are working as hard as they can, but seem to be falling further and further
behind.  And for the first time since the end of World War II, public opinion
polls a couple of years ago showed that a majority of Americans had become
pessimistic and believed that their children would be worse off economically
than their parents.</P>
<P>Welfare recipients suffer even more from these structural economic changes. 
They generally are the least educated and have the fewest skills.  The evidence
shows pretty clearly that even for those welfare recipients who are able to work
-- and most are children and the women who care for them -- the jobs they are
qualified to do are few and declining, and not very well paid.  </P>
<P>So how will cutting off welfare for such people help?  Without assuring that
there are enough decent jobs actually available, cutting off welfare will do
little except increase misery and attendant social pathologies.  That's why
Senator Moynihan denounced the welfare bill in such strong terms.</P>
<P>Moynihan is an established scholar in the field and he knows that something
very much like what we are experiencing now happened in England two centuries
ago, at the dawn of industrialization.  </P>
<P>During most of the 18th century, nearly all English citizens were
agricultural workers dependent on wages.  But there was also a welfare system. 
People were entitled to relief if they were temporarily unemployed, or if they
were old, disabled, infirm or orphaned.</P>

<P>Although like the modern American welfare system, the English system was
often inadequate, it kept the economic and social life of rural villages fairly
stable and intact.  But toward the end of the 18th century, in the years just
before the beginning of Queen Victoria's long reign, something began to happen
that shattered the stability of this system.  Poverty -- what they then called
pauperism -- began to rise steeply.  Moreover, much of it seemed to be
permanent, that is, a surplus of labor for which the market had no need became a
permanent feature of the economic landscape.  Ironically, this was accompanied
by a national rise in trade, what today we might call economic growth.  So while
the economy was growing as a whole, a large portion of the population was
excluded from that growth.  These developments were unprecedented, and due to
major changes in the political economy - including the dawn of the industrial
age -- that few could see or understand at the time.</P>
<P>The traditional English relief system began to crack under pressures it was
not designed to absorb.  As unemployment increased and became more permanent,
poverty became very expensive to relieve.  Not understanding the macro-economic
forces that were causing these dislocations, they began to attribute the problem
-- as we have today -- to the welfare system itself.  Local governments were
given increased responsibility to find work for the able-bodied, but then as now
there was little work to be found for those whose skills and labor the market no
longer required.  </P>
<P>At first, the cost of welfare went up, but then the cost became politically
unbearable, and subsistence subsidies were cut.  Between 1815 and 1834, poor law
expenditures decreased precipitously -- about 30 percent per capita and 50
percent as a percentage of national income.  The minimum level of subsistence --
not generous to begin with in 1795 -- declined to levels that assured misery.</P>
<P>The industrialization of rural England brought further economic
dislocations.  The power loom replaced handweaving and forever changed the
economy of English villages.  Manufacturing shifted to large-scale factories,
leaving entire cottage industries permanently destroyed, and the people who had
earned a living from them permanently unemployed.  A relief system intended
temporarily to help the unlucky working poor become transformed into a system
that permanently maintained the dependency of those whom the economy no longer
needed.  Demoralization among the poor became widespread, and the poor
themselves became a social problem.  Then, as now, some people began to imagine

that relief programs themselves were  the problem, and that if they were ended,
the poor would raise themselves up.  </P>
<P>At the turn of the 19th century, Thomas Malthus, the most blunt opponent of
government support for the poor, argued that the only way to solve the problem
of the dependent poor was to abolish government relief programs.  Malthus
opposed public relief programs because he believed, like some in Congress today,
they did no good and merely debilitated those they intended to help.  His
solution was to abolish such support entirely.  If all relief were denied,
Malthus argued, nature would take its course.  Some perhaps would die, but those
who survived would be stronger; they would learn virtue; independence,
self-reliance, sexual restraint, what some today are calling Victorian morals.</P>
<P>As it turned out, an undiluted dose of Malthusian medicine proved too harsh
then, as it has now.  But Malthus created the framework for debate, and set the
stage for other unbelievably harsh proposals, which seemed reasonable by
comparison.  Thus did a shift occur, as it has today, toward public immorality,
the capacity of decent, personally virtuous citizens who believe themselves to
be concerned about others to support policies that are incredibly cruel,
coercive, callous and shameful, all the while using the language of personal
morality and private virtue.</P>
<P>Malthus was followed by Jeremy Bentham, who opposed the complete abolition
of relief.  He was, perhaps, the first advocate of workfare in a world that no
longer seemed able to provide real jobs.  He proposed to build 500 large
workhouses, systematically distributed so that no one would be far from one. 
People would be assigned geographically; infants would be branded at birth to
assure proper assignment.  Everyone would work, even the blind. Child labor was
an integral part of his plan.  </P>
<P>Bentham's master plan was also eventually rejected by Parliament, but like
Malthus' proposal, it moved the center of debate and rendered acceptable what
might otherwise have been seen as unacceptable.  Bentham's central idea
survived:  relief should be available but the conditions of relief should be
made so horrible, so humiliating, so punitive, so harsh that no one short of
starvation would choose to be a recipient.  In 1834, the new Poor Law was
passed, essentially reflecting this idea.</P>
<P>There would be no entitlement to relief.  Support would be provided only in
exchange for work.  But since no real jobs were available to the poor (that,
after all, was the problem), workhouses would be established and people who
chose public support would have to enter the workhouse, a place deliberately
designed to impose shame and stigma.  </P>
<P>As many have pointed out, no English legislation was ever so hated.  Those
who had no choice but to enter the world of the workhouse were in effect

banished form civil society and forced to exchange all dignity and independence
for the means of support.  Those who refused such a bargain and chose to be
independent, were forced to make their way in a world that had no use for them. 
Where once they had been degraded by their dependency on public support, now
they were degraded even more by the illusion of independence.  They were forced
to be responsible for themselves at a moment in time when for them that was not
possible.</P>
<P>Independence and social abandonment in a political economy that could not
absorb their surplus labor and had less and less need for their skills resulted
not in any moral uplifting or fresh incentive to work but rather in severe
suffering, misery and degradation -- not only of the able-bodied adult worker,
but also and depravedly of children, old people and the disabled.  This is the
world chronicled in Charles Dickens' novels.</P>
<P>Are there lessons in all this for America in 1996?  It has, of course,
become fashionable lately to celebrate Victorian values, to applaud the English
Poor Law that, as Gertrude Himmelfarb has written, &quot;would promote the moral
as well as the material well-being of the recipients of relief by providing
incentives to go off relief rather than remain on, and by encouraging those
virtues of self-reliance, self-respect and self-discipline that would transform
paupers into self-supporting workers.&quot;  What Himmelfarb doesn't tell us is
what exactly those incentives to avoid relief were, and what misery they
produced.  Nor does she tell us that they were spectacularly unsuccessful in
transforming paupers into self-supporting workers because the fundamental
problem was not a lack of individual virtue or self- respect or self-reliance
but rather an epic change in the political economy that made adequate wage-based
support virtually impossible for large numbers of people.</P>
<P>Eventually, pauperism in England declined.  But it was not because paupers
became, as individuals, more virtuous.  It was because economic expansion raised
real wages by 50 percent between 1850 and 1885, and by another 40 percent
between 1885 and 1900.  Poverty was reduced by the same thing that had expanded
it: large economic forces.  What transformed paupers into self- supporting
workers was not institutionalized cruelty, Malthusian jungle economics or moral
lectures from Queen Victoria.  What reduced poverty was the greater availability
of real jobs at decent wages.  </P>
<P>The problem of poverty during a time of economic dislocation and transition
is what to do in the meantime, and how to help those who are left out.  This
cannot be accomplished through moral exhortations from people who do not need to
worry about paying their rent, and it is despicable -- yes, shameful, to use a
good Victorian word -- to repeat the failed experiment of designed cruelty as an

incentive to force people into a labor market that has no use for them.</P>
<P>The problem we face today is not &quot;welfare&quot; nor the immorality of
individuals who are poor and unemployed.  The problem we face is the political
economy, now as in 1834.  The notion that we can save those left out of the
economy by abandoning them is truly perverse.  It is also immoral, for those who
care about values.</P>

</P>
<P>September 8, 1996
</P>
<H2>School Vouchers and False Promises</H2>
<P>	The new look in educational fashion this season is &quot;choice.&quot;
</P>
<P>A powerful movement has developed to push the idea that parents ought to be
able to send their children to any school they choose -- public or private --
and that the government ought to pay for that choice by giving parents vouchers
worth, say, $3,000, which they can use to pay tuition at any school they choose.
</P>
<P>Thus if parents choose to send their child to a private school, the
government would be obligated to pay part of the tuition.  This would constitute
a new and huge government expenditure.  Where will this money come from at a
time when government spending is being cut and candidates everywhere are
proposing to lower taxes and reduce aid to education?  There is only one place
it can come from: the existing public school budget.
</P>
<P>Government support for parents who pay private school tuition inescapably
means less government money for the already-struggling public schools.  There is
little question that the growing movement to have the government pay for private
school tuitions will result in weakening the public school system.  And once it
is weakened, the flight from public schools will accelerate, assisted by
government dollars, until the public school system itself is mortally wounded.
</P>
<P>So what, some say.  Supporters of vouchers and the shift toward private
schools argue that the competition to attract students, and therefore government
dollars, among schools both public and private will improve education and result
in improved academic performance, particularly for poor, minority students who
currently attend inner-city schools.  Such students will be better off, so the
argument goes, if they can go to the same private schools where wealthy parents
send their children.
</P>
<P>There are some factual problems with this argument:
</P>
<P>1.   There is no credible evidence to support the belief that poor children,
given public money to go to private schools, actually do better in math and
reading than comparable children in public school.   An experiment to test
precisely this proposition has been going on in Milwaukee, Wisconsin since 1990.
  The study's conclusion shows no difference, so far, in math and reading
scores.   (A second study by a different team of researchers recently concluded
the opposite -- that the children in private schools did better than those in
public schools.  But the study failed to take account of differences in family
background, a critical methodological error.  There is no way to measure the
difference a school makes if you don't compare children with similar advantages
or disadvantages.)
</P>
<P>2.   Unlike public schools, private schools are not required to accept
everyone.  Therefore they tend to avoid students with the most problems, a
luxury public schools do not have.   If you pick your students right, your
school's results will look good.  Moreover, the notion that under a voucher
system, parents will be able to choose &quot;the best school&quot; for their
child is a fantasy if &quot;the best school&quot; can refuse to admit the child.
 That is precisely what will happen to many parents, thereby making the reality
of choice something less than promised.  If the voucher system is supposed to
benefit the most disadvantaged children, how will that happen if those children
are denied admission by &quot;the best schools?&quot;
</P>
<P>3.   No voucher system that has been passed or proposed pays the entire
tuition at private schools.  The bill that passed the House of Representatives
in late 1995 provided vouchers worth $3,000.  But according to the National
Association of Independent Schools, the median tuition bill for their schools
was $10,300 in 1995; that means half the schools charged more than $10,300.  In
New York and New Jersey, the median tuition was $12,500.  Even in the Southeast,
it was $7,200.  So in order to be able to use the $3,000 government voucher, a
parent would have to come up with the rest -- in New York that would mean $9,500
more; nationally it would mean $7,300 more.
</P>
<P>Where will poor, inner-city parents get that money?  Indeed, where will the
average middle-class parent get $7,300 per child per year to supplement the
$3,000 government voucher?
</P>
<P>The fact is that if such a $3,000 voucher were available, it would primarily
provide assistance to the affluent and the wealthy, to parents who already send
their children to private schools or to parents who could afford $7,000 but not
$10,000.
</P>
<P>The voucher plan cannot help those it is intended to help -- poor, minority,
inner-city children.  They will be left behind in the public schools while
wealthier children flee.  And those public schools will have less money because
part of their budgets will have been skimmed off to pay for private school
tuition of more affluent children.  The public schools will deteriorate further,
leaving the children who most need the schools trapped there.
</P>
<P>The voucher plan is a scam designed to benefit the wealthy and destroy
public education.  It holds out hope for inner-city children -- poor minority
kids in Washington, D.C. should be able to go to the same private school where
President Clinton sends his daugher, so the argument goes -- but the reality is
that practically no poor, inner-city parent will be able to use the voucher
because they won't be able to come up with the difference between the value of
the voucher and the tuition actually charged.
</P>
<P>4.  Religious schools normally charge less than non-sectarian private
schools.  Thus a major consequence of a $3,000 voucher plan will be to direct
tax-raised government money away from public schools and into church schools. 
This raises severe constitutional questions.  If a major and foreseeable
consequence of voucher plans it to funnel most of the money into church schools
because the value of the voucher is set to coincide with what church schools
charge, then this is precisely what the founders of this country sought to
avoid: money raised from everyone's taxes used to support sectarian religious
institutions.
</P>
<P>The idea of choice sounds good to parents who naturally want the best for
their child.  And the idea that goverment would give parents vouchers to use at
the school of their choice sounds attractive.  But unless government is willing
to pay the entire tuition bill and require private schools to admit students on
the same basis as public schools, there will be no choice, certainly not for
parents of modest means.
</P>
<P>The voucher movement promises choice but cannot deliver it.  The idea sounds
good, until you look at the actual bills being proposed and think carefully
about how it would actually work.  Then you see the voucher movement for what it
is: a cynical attempt to grab tax dollars for the relatively wealthy and for
church schools at the expense of public school budgets.
</P>
<P>No fair-minded American should support these voucher bills.  And most poor
and middle-class Americans will not benefit from them.  To be certain, the
public school system that has been an engine of opportunity for generations of
poor and middle-class Americans will be destroyed, and with it the promise of
economic mobility for those who need it most.

<P><I>Guest Columnist, Loren Siegel, ACLU Public Education Director</I>
</P>
<P>September 15, 1996
</P>
<H2>Reflections on Lethal Injection</H2>
<P>There is a new occupation in New York State for which the faint of heart
need not apply.  It's called &quot;execution technician.&quot;  This is the
person who will mix and administer the toxic combination of drugs necessary to
carry out execution by lethal injection.  The position is still vacant, since
New York State only reinstated capital punishment last year and its death row is
still untenanted.  But eventually, unless the state's highest court declares the
statute unconstitutional, someone is going to have to fill those shoes.</P>
<P>Since January 1996, 30 human beings have been executed in this country, 26
of them by lethal injection.  At this rate, 1996 will be the peak year for
executions since 1976, when the Supreme Court's decision in <I>Gregg v. Georgia</I>
reinstated the death penalty after a four year hiatus.  It's almost as though
the availability of this no-fuss, no-mess method of extermination is driving the
dramatic escalation in the number of people put to death.  In 1982 there were
only 2 executions nationwide.  By 1993, there were 38.  And by 1995, the number
had spiked to 56.</P>
<P>Lethal injection has become the method of choice for executioner states 
because it  is perceived as a painless, hygienic medical procedure.  No more
contorted limbs, popped out eyeballs or scorched flesh from an excess of
electric current  (n.b. that electrocution was believed to be far more humane
than hanging when it was introduced in 1890).  As one of its first proponents
once put it, &quot;Being a former farmer and horse raiser, I know what it's like
to try to eliminate an injured horse by shooting him.  Now you call the
veterinarian and the vet gives it a shot and the horse goes to sleep -- that's
it.&quot;  (Gov. Ronald Reagan, 1973).</P>
<P>But is that really &quot;it&quot;?  Of course no one has lived to tell the
tale, but lethal injection, while much kinder to the onlookers, is clearly not a
painless experience for the person to whom it is being administered.  In fact,
electrocution is much faster and less painful than lethal injection, and
beheading is less painful still.  So, if we were really concerned about the
condemned person's comfort level, we would be bringing back the guillotine.</P>
<P>Here's how lethal injection works.  First you are strapped down on a gurney,
arms extended and wrists bound in place.  Then the execution technician (who
cannot be a doctor or a nurse because the AMA's Code of Ethics forbids medical
professionals from participating in executions) inserts the intravenous line
into your arm (but only after swabbing the arm with alcohol -- to prevent
infection...)  Sometimes the needle is inserted only after lengthy and painful
probing to find a viable vein.  Then sodium pentothal is injected to render you
unconscious.  Then pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride are introduced
into your vein, the first to paralyze your diaphragm and stop your breathing,
and the second to cause your heart to stop beating.</P>
<P>Sometimes things go wrong.  In Texas, there have been a number of botched
executions since lethal injection was introduced.  In one, it took 24 minutes to
kill a man, after the tube attached to the needle in his arm leaked and sprayed
toxic chemicals in the direction of witnesses.  In another, the initial dose of
chemicals was too weak, causing the &quot;patient&quot; to choke and heave for
several minutes before death came.</P>
<P>Why am I going into such gruesome detail?  Because there are more than 3,000
human beings on death row today, and if we are going to condemn most of them to
death by lethal injection, we ought to at least know what it is we are
perpetrating.  Also because I, like Justice Thurgood Marshall, have enough faith
in the American people to believe, as he did, that &quot;fully informed of the
purposes of the death penalty and its liabilities&quot; they will &quot;reject
it as morally unacceptable.&quot;</P>
<P>Obviously, we abolitionists have an uphill struggle ahead of  us.  Support
for capital punishment has never been stronger.  According to a 1995 Gallup
poll, 77% of Americans favor the death penalty for murder, and only 13% oppose
it (the rest are undecided).   This is in spite of the fact that the public
knows, or should know, that the death penalty is not a deterrent, that it is
applied disproportionately to poor people, that it is applied in a racially
discriminatory way, and that sometimes innocent people are mistakenly executed. 
These facts have been reported in the media many many times. </P>
<P>So, what do Americans need in order to be, in the words of Justice Marshall,
&quot;fully informed&quot; about the death penalty?   Perhaps they need to see
the consequences of their support.  Forty years ago Albert Camus, the French
writer, philosopher and abolitionist, published his essay<I> Reflections on the
Guillotine.</I>  In it, he argued passionately that executions ought to be made
public:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;[Society] must show the executioner's hands each time and force
everyone to look at them -- the over-delicate citizens and all those who had any
responsibility in bringing the executioner into being.  Otherwise, society
admits that it kills without knowing what it is saying or doing.&quot;  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What would happen if instead of being performed in secrecy, every single
execution were televised live during prime time, including the botched up ones? 
  Would support for the death penalty  drop off?  You bet it would.  If people
found the sanitized Hollywood version of lethal injection shown in <I>Dead Man
Walking</I> distressing, they will find a real live execution absolutely gut
wrenching.  And maybe that's what it will take. </P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="/graphics/vision.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P><I>by Ira Glasser, ACLU Executive Director</I></P>
<H2>How To Celebrate the Constitution</H2>
<P><FONT SIZE="-2">This essay appeared in an ACLU brochure printed in 1991 in
observance of the 200th Anniversary of the Bill of Rights.</FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">200</FONT> years ago</B>, the founders of this country
brought forth a remarkable, if flawed,  document.  The Constitution, with the
Bill of Rights added to it, established an unprecedented legal and political
framework for the protection of liberty and democracy.  From Montesquieu, it
took the structural idea of separation of powers, establishing a legislature to
make the laws, an executive branch to implement them and an independent

judiciary to check them both, and to settle disputes involving interpretations

of the law.       </P>
<P>From the philosophes of the enlightenment, it took the substantive
principles of individual liberty and codified those principles in the Bill of
Rights.  Understanding that even a majoritarian democracy required strict legal
limits on governmental power, the founders established such limits by adding the
first ten amendments to the fledgling Constitution.       </P>
<P>It is worth remembering, of course, that even this bright beginning required
political struggle.  The Bill of Rights was not part of the Constitution as it
was drafted on September 17, 1787.  Nor was it part of the Constitution
submitted to the 13 states for ratification.  Rather, it was extracted as the
price of ratification after intense political struggle and because the
anti-federalists had enough votes to block ratification of the unamended
Constitution.       When we celebrate the Constitution as we know it today, we
celebrate not only those who labored and debated during the summer of 1787, but
also those who found their product wanting, and during the months following the
summer of 1787, fought to improve it.  At its birth, the Constitution was not
only the product of learned debate among delegates to the Constitutional
Convention, but also of those whose vision of liberty was more insistent, and
who were prepared to fight for that vision, even if it meant rejecting the
Convention's work.       </P>
<P>But even with the Bill of Rights added to it, the Constitution was a deeply
flawed document.  It legitimized slavery and racial discrimination; indeed, that
legitimization was the price of the new Federal system.  Slavery was this
country's original sin, infecting the Constitution at its conception.  And for
the first 78 years of the Bicentennial we celebrate today, the Constitution
protected racial slavery and legalized racial discrimination. Certainly, it is
not that Constitution we celebrate today.       </P>
<P>The Constitution we celebrate today -- a document that guarantees equality
before the law -- required years of struggle and a bloody civil war before
additional amendments were passed, intended to bring African Americans within
the Constitution and to apply the Bill of Rights to state and local governments.
      </P>
<P>But even after the Civil War amendments were passed, liberty and equality
did not follow automatically or easily from the text.  Within a short period of
time, the hopes and aspirations of black people were snuffed out, white hegemony
was restored, and the promise of the 14th and 15th amendments almost completely
frustrated.       </P>
<P>It would take another century, before the struggles of black people began
even minimally to redeem the promise of the Civil War amendments.  During that
time, racial discrimination became deeply embedded in our laws, our political

institutions and our culture. Racial violence was common, and black people --
especially and tragically the young -- learned to limit their aspirations.  Most
whites accepted this, and nearly all whites benefited from it.  And until 1954,
the United States Supreme Court legitimized it.       </P>
<P>For 165 years of the Bicentennial we celebrate today, the Constitution
permitted racial discrimination and legitimized the suffocation of black hopes
for equal opportunity.  Certainly, it is not that Constitution we celebrate
today.       </P>
<P>What we celebrate today is not only the paper on which our rights were
written, but also the struggles of those who fought, and died, to make those
rights a reality, to bring those &quot;parchment&quot; rights to life.      
</P>
<P>We celebrate Frederick Douglass, who told a white audience on July 5, 1852: 
         </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence,
bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you, not me.  The sunlight that brought
light and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me.  This fourth of
July is yours, not mine.  You may rejoice, I must mourn.&quot;       </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We celebrate Jackie Robinson, who stood alone in the world of baseball in
1947, breaking the racial barrier to what had cynically been called &quot;the
national pastime.&quot;  And we celebrate Branch Rickey, a white man in a
position of authority, who helped him.       </P>
<P>We celebrate Oliver Brown, who a few years later bravely walked his daughter
Linda to their neighborhood school, which was by law limited to white children. 
     </P>
<P>We celebrate Rosa Parks, who sat down on a Montgomery bus, and Martin Luther
King, Jr., who stood up to finish what she began.       </P>
<P>We celebrate the children at Central High School in Little Rock, and Medgar
Evers, and Viola Liuzzo and the three young men whose bodies ended up in a
Mississippi dam in the summer of 1964.       </P>
<P>It was more than 175 years after the Constitution was written -- nearly 90
percent of the period from ratification to the present -- before the civil
rights laws were passed outlawing racial discrimination in employment, housing,
public accommodations, and voting.  And even now, 25 years after those laws were
passed, that effort is far from over.       </P>
<P>Indeed, if we can pause in the midst of our struggle to celebrate how far we
have come in approaching liberty, then we must recognize that it is the entire
200-year period we must celebrate, and not just its beginning.  It is the people
who fought and died to realize our rights who deserve our recognition and our
praise, not just those who first conceived of those rights and wrote them down. 
     </P>
<P>A proper celebration of past struggles must include a commitment to future
struggles.  For the path to liberty and equality does not end neatly on
anniversaries.  It goes on.  Although the civil rights movement struck down the
crudest legal barriers, it could not strike down the effects of centuries.  It
did not strike down the economic disadvantages that still fell
disproportionately on African American people.  It did not strike down what
W.E.B. DuBois once called &quot;centuries of instinct, habit and thought.&quot; 
     </P>
<P>In many ways, we still live in what the Kerner Commission described two
decades ago as &quot;two societies, one black, one white - - separate and
unequal.&quot;  Much work remains to be done.  The stain of slavery is not
easily removed.  We live in a time when housing segregation is increasing, when
public schools are increasingly segregated and deteriorating in quality and when
alarming numbers of African American youngsters are growing up without hope or a
stake in the future of this society.  And yet this is also the time when the
enforcement of civil rights laws has been intentionally diminished, when special
efforts to remedy centuries of discrimination are being resisted, and when
racial violence and hostility are on the rise.       </P>
<P>Any celebration of what has been accomplished during our first two centuries
also requires a commitment to what remains to be done during the third century. 
And what is true about the history of the struggle for racial equality is also
true about the struggle for other liberties.       </P>
<P>At its birth, for example, the Constitution tolerated the subjugation of
women.  It was not until 1920, 133 years after the Constitution was drafted,
that the 19th amendment was ratified, finally giving women the elementary right
to vote.  The realization of this right was not due to the wisdom or courage of
the founders, but to the struggle that followed.  And it would be over 40 years
after the right to vote was established before the United States Supreme Court
would strike down a Connecticut law prohibiting the sale of contraceptives, thus
ushering in a legal movement for reproductive freedom.  It was not until 1973
that the right of a women to have an abortion was established, a right that has
required continued intense struggle ever since to maintain.       </P>
<P>If the Constitution knowingly left out African Americans and women, it
didn't even think about others: For nearly all of the last 200 years, lesbians
and gay men, children, students, prisoners, the mentally ill, soldiers, the
physically disabled, welfare recipients and others were largely unprotected by
the Constitution.  One by one, beginning in the 1960's they went into the
streets and into the courts and into the legislatures with a simple but
revolutionary question:  Does the Bill of Rights apply to us?  And slowly,
partially, grudgingly, came the answer: &quot;yes,&quot; but only after much

struggle.       </P>
<P>A proper celebration of the Bill of Rights today must include, therefore, a
celebration of these profound efforts, along with a commitment to continue them
into the Constitution's third century.  Such efforts are necessary because the
Bill of Rights is not self-enforcing.  Indeed, the securing of each and every
liberty will continue to require dedication to the preservation of freedom by
all Americans, as well as the vision and perseverance of those few men and women
who, in every era, are willing to step forward -- even in the face of scorn or
hopelessness -- and press the fight for their rights.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

</font><P><P>
A number of sites have been created to help Internet users take advantage of 
resources unique to the on-line world.  Some sites, ranging from listings of available 
electronic versions of books and magazines to information on newsgroups, 
attempt to index and explain the sometimes confusing array of Internet resources by focusing on one particular type of resource.
<P>
Other resources attempt to catalog as many Internet sites as possible, irregardless of subject matter.  Known as 'search engines,' these resources vary in their thoroughness of coverage, speed of query return, and detail of results. 
<P>
 Below, the ACLU has attempted to make sense of the rapidly growing array of Internet research tools.  If you know of a particularly helpful resource that you think should be included in this listing, be sure to use our <a href="http://www.aclu.org/feedback.html">feedback form</a> to let us know.

fact that a human being categorizes each new entry cuts down on

the number of irrelevent retrievals.

Gopher servers are text-based sites organized in outline form;

many are in the process of being replaced by web sites. However,

gopher sites often provide lengthy and unfilitered documents,

making them a good place to look for comprehensive information

on a topic.  The name is either: 1) a reference to the nickname

of the University of Minnesota, where the concept was first developed;

or 2) a variation on the slang term 'go-fer,' as in 'go for some

coffee.'

<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/archie.html">Archie</A>
<P>
<DD>
The Archie system searches a database of files available via

anonymous File Transfer Protocol (ftp). Search terms are not subject-oriented;

they are file name-oriented. Thus, a search for 'liberty' will

only pull up those sites with file names containing the word 'liberty'.

  This site contains a form-based interface that allows the user

to choose the number of hits returned, the type of search performed,

and the country-location of the server used.

servers also covered.  The

<DD>
There are a number of valuable resources available through this telnet site created 
by the Triangle Research Libraries Network (Duke, North Carolina State,  and the 
University of North Carolina.  Item #1 on the main menu allows for searches of 
the respective school library catalogs (options #1-3), and government documents(#4).  
<P>
Option #5, Other Library Catalogs, allows users access to a listing that is 
alphabetical by name (#1, Hytelnet) or by state (#2, LIBS).  Hytelnet is designed 
to help keep track of the libraries that are accessible via telnet.  It can also 
be used via its <a href="http://www.cc.ukans.edu/hytelnet_html/START.TXT.html">web site</a>.
Users choose commands and move the cursor around the screen by using the arrow keys.  Hitting 
return while on the Library catalogs line brings you to various menus where you can 
choose the geographic location of libraries to look for.  Once you decide on a particular
library to visit, Hytelnet gives you information on how to login and exit, then 
asks if you want to be connected.  Once you do, you leave Hytelnet and enter that 
particular library's on-line catalog system.  When you exit, you return directly to 
Hytelnet. 
<P>
 Aside from library catalog systems, Hytelnet also indexes some Other resources 
avalable via Telnet.  Subcategories include databases and bibliographies, distributed 
file servers (gopher/WAIS/WWW), and Fee-based Services.    
 
        

Choosing item #2 on the main menu, Journal Articles Indexes, and then option #1, UnCover, brings you (after a short wait and 
a screen where you identify the type of terminal you are using) to a menu presenting 
the CARL Corporation's "shopping list of databases."  This database is also available independently,
by telnetting to <A HREF="telnet://database.carl.org">telnet://database.carl.org</a>.   The Uncover database, option #1,
 indexes journals and their table of contents, adding citations on 
a daily basis.  The user-friendly interface allows you to search by key word, 

or specific journal title; for a fee, fax copies of articles can be obtained.  
<P>The 
Journal Graphics database, option #7, indexes television and radio transcripts and can be 
searched by key word or name.  Actual copies of the transcripts are available for 
a fee.  Also under option #7 is the British Library Document Supply Centre, which in 
addition to indexing 54,000 current journals also contains articles from 170,000 journals that 
have ceased publications; hard copies of articles are available for a fee.  Also 
under option #7 is the Federal Domestic Assistance Catalog.  Typing in key words pulls 
up extremely detailed information on over 1300 government programs that provide 
grants, loans, and technical assistance.  Full contact information is provided for 
each program.  Finally, under option #7 there is an interesting service named 
KnowledgeOne that promises, for a fee, to answer any question or request for information.

<h2>HABEAS CORPUS AT RISK</h2>
<p>
Congress continues to threaten the Writ of Habeas Corpus.  
The Senate terrorism bill, passed in June by a vote of 91-8, 
included a provision that would make it virtually impossible 
for a federal court to correct a constitutionally erroneous state 
court decision.  It could do so only if the state court's decision 
was "unreasonably wrong."
<p>
The House proposal on terrorism originally did not contain a 
habeas corpus measure.  A later "compromise" version contains 
one  similar to that passed by the Senate.
<p>
The House leadership threatened to bring this new terrorism + 
habeas bill (HR 2768, "The "Effective Death Penalty and 
Antiterrorism Act of 1995") up for a vote just before the Christmas 
recess.  However, opposition to the inclusion of the habeas 
provisions, and problems on the part of conservative Republican 
freshmen denied the leadership the margin of votes needed to
bring the bill to the floor for a vote.  We are now told that the House 
leadership will seek a vote on this bill sometime in late January or 
early February. 
  <p>
The Congressional leadership machinations make it difficult to keep 
track of the content and numerical identification of this legislation.  
On December 19, a joint letter expressing opposition to HR 2703 
(the predecessor of HR 2768) was sent to House Speaker Gingrich 
and Minority Leader Gephardt by the ACLU, the Citizens Committee 
for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, the Gun Owners of America, 
the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Second 
Amendment Foundation and Ross and Green.  
<p>
In part the letter stated "The Federal courts must remain open and 
able to review the legality of convictions and sentences to ensure
that when the government seeks the liberty or life of an individual, 
it acts within the law. ... [This measure] would prevent the federal 
courts from performing their essential function of assuring that 
convictions and sentences comport with the basic requirements 
 of the United States Constitution.  [It] would too greatly hamper 
 the federal courts in carrying out that function, among other things 
by requiring extraordinary deference to constitutionally erroneous 
state court decisions and imposing arbitrarily rigid time limits on 
the filing of habeas petitions for the first time in the nation's history."
<p>

A very useful article by Leslie Hagin, of the National Association of 
Criminal Defense Lawyers, discussing habeas "reform" legislation
appeared in the December 15, 1995 issue of Gun Week.  
<p>
Abolitionists and others opposed to the evisceration of federal 
habeas corpus relief must express their opposition to the inclusion
of limitations on habeas in the already draconian terrorism bill.  
They must urge Representatives not to give in to pressure to pass
a terrorism bill, especially one that includes habeas "reform."  
Details and arguments are discussed in the last two issues of The
ACLU Abolitionist.  Call Travia for a copy of the joint letter sent to 
House leaders, for ACLU's analysis of the Terrorism Act, or a copy 
of the Gun Week article.  You can also get these documents from 
ACLU's Constitution Hall on AOL.

<blockquote>
<h2>THE FEDERAL DEATH PENALTY </h2>
<p>
While the death penalty has been left primarily to the states, 
recent imposition of federal death sentences on two men in Texas
shows the federal government intends to rival the states in its 
expanded use.  Between 1963 and 1994 the federal government
imposed death on 6 persons.  All were sentenced under the 1988 
Anti-Drug Abuse Act, signed into law by President Bush.  It allows 
the death penalty for a defendant who intentionally kills in the course 
of committing a felony drug offense.
<p>
     But the 1988 law can't hold a candle to the Federal Death Penalty 
Act (FDPA) signed into law by President Clinton in September 1994, 
which allows the death penalty for about 60 offenses.  Twenty two 
capital prosecutions have been authorized under this law since its 
enactment, with the first two death sentences announced last month. 
In the same time frame another 8 cases were prosecuted under the 
1988 law.  While the scope of federal death prosecutions is still far 
smaller than that in the states, only the tip of the iceberg may be 
visible as yet, for the FDPA authorizes the death penalty for just 
about any murder. 
<p>
     The intent of the federal hangmen is signalled by the implementation 
of the FDPA, the increase in prosecution under the Act, and the attempt 
in this Congressional session to provide statutory authority for a 
centralized federal death row in Terre Haute, Indiana.  The latter was 
(so far!) halted, in part through the efforts of the ACLU, the National 
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and others.  For an analysis 
of the FDPA, call Travia.

<blockquote><h2>POST-CONVICTION DEFENDER ORGANIZATIONS </h2>
<P>
The almost-inevitable closing of the Post-Conviction Defender Organizations, 
formerly known as Death Penalty Resource Centers, has been delayed by 
the federal budget debate.  The legislation defunding the 20 PCDOs was 
part of the Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary Appropriations bill which 
President Clinton vetoed December 19.     
<P>
In 20 states, Post Conviction Defense Organizations (PCDOs) conduct the 
appeals of indigent death-sentenced prisoners. PCDOs represent some 
defendants, train lawyers in the critically important and arcane details of 
providing effective appeals in capital cases, assist in finding expert 
consultants, and enable networking among advocates for appellants on 
death row.  
<P>
In fiscal year 1995 PCDOs received $19.8 million in federal funds.  As 
discussed above, the precise details regarding the date on which funding 
will end depends on current negotiations surrounding the budget and the 
appropriations bill funding the judiciary.  The Florida and Tennessee PCDOs 
have already closed their doors.  The future of the other 18 centers is 
uncertain.  It is expected that Congress will provide funds for a six month 
phase-out period.

   <h2>SUPREME COURT WATCH</h2>
<p>
On January 9 the Court will hear arguments in Loving v. United States, 
which focuses on the military death penalty.  The issue in Loving is 
whether the President has the constitutional power to prescribe death 
eligible crimes under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  The ACLU 
filed an amicus brief in the case.  
<p>
Other cases before the court include Lonchar v. Thomas (argued 
December 4). and Cooper v. Oklahoma (scheduled for January 16).  A 
description of these cases and the Court's decision will be discussed 
in upcoming issues.

<blockquote><h2> CONVERSATION WITH AN ABOLITIONIST</h2>
<p>
In the 1960's she was a philosopher, an activist in the fight for civil
rights and against the war in Viet Nam.  In the early 70's DENISE 
Le BOEUF settled in New Orleans were she got a chance to reflect, 
pursue other interests and to travel.
<p>
Work in civil rights had sensitized her to issues of criminal justice, and 
in time, feeling this was the most concrete way to help, she entered 
Tulane's School of Law.  There, she soon got a chance to test her resolve, 
for Tulane has an active law clinic:  Denise was a member of a team, led 
by the clinic's director, which defended two persons charged with homicide.
<p>
After graduation she clerked for a judge on the Louisiana Supreme Court -- 
and had to argue her very first capital appeal to that same bench!  Her 
first post-conviction case came in 1989, working with the Loyola Death 
Penalty Resource Center in New Orleans.  In 1992, she joined the 
Center's staff.  Denny also is a valuable member of the Advisory Board 
of the Capital Punishment Project.  
<p>
Based on her first-hand experiences with its victims, Denny is increasingly 
convinced that the death penalty machine is fueled by problems of poverty, 
race and civil rights, compounded by child abuse and the use of drugs.  
Many aspects of her work with death row inmates are gut-wrenching, 
but they are also uplifting, for the courage and moral fiber of many of her 
clients and their families are inspiring.  
<p>
"I'm very lucky to have a job that enables me to work for a cause I strongly 
believe in, and in the course of which I meet so many inspiring people" 
says Denny.  "The defense, even of those who committed a heinous 
crime is not a personal dilemma.  Many of my clients have done terrible 
things; most were so profoundly disabled by problems of mental health 
or family history that they cannot function in society.  But some overcame 
such a situation.  One of our clients, for instance, was a drug user who 
committed armed robbery (his co-defendant was the actual killer).  During 
13 years on Louisiana's death row he was a friend of almost all those
executed there during that time.  In the process he's become a fine human 
being."  But this surely is not the way to rehabilitate someone! 
<p>
Representation of a death row inmate is all-involving.  There's too much to 
do, with too little help, and uneven and undependable resources.  Denny's 
opponent, the State of Louisiana, has infinitely more resources - 
investigative, forensic, scientific and mental health experts, researchers, 
etc.  However, some help is available for the community of dedicated 
volunteers, e.g., experts willing to work at reduced rate, and fellow 
attorneys with whom to consult.  Many more volunteers are needed, 
she says, from paralegal, counselors, mitigation investigators, to people 
willing to do office work and raise funds. 
<p>
"The loss of funds for Resource Centers is a catastrophe for those on death 
row.  Many now have no lawyer - period!  Defense lawyers are trying to fill 
the gap as best they can.  Most states have some, but inadequate funding 
for direct appeals to state courts.  But for state post-conviction petitions,
lawyers representing death row inmates have to scramble for funds.  The 
struggle for funds, the lack of professional coordination, the loss of pooled
resources for expertise is incredibly wasteful.  It will end up significantly
increasing the costs and decreasing the efficiency of the death machine.  
<p>
How best to work for Abolition?  "My clients' inability to function in
society is almost always a result of child abuse.  Drug and alcohol 
abuse is common, it's an attempt to self-medicate their agony.  Often 
it's also a precipitating factor for the crime.  The root problem of child 
abuse is compounded by the drug use, and by the problems of our society, 
such as unemployment, violence, fear, racism, vengefulness, etc.  To a 
large extent these are compounded by the death penalty itself."
<p>
"We must improve our abolitionist message, and our way to put it across.  
We must address the sensible people in our society, those who care 
about fairness.  Somehow we must bypass the din of politicians with a 
vested interest in the death penalty.  Abolition is a civil and
constitutional rights issue, strongly tied to issues of poverty, prejudice 
and race.  The ACLU must treat it as such, and give it center stage."

<P>
<blockquote>
<h2>THE DEATH PENALTY IN THE STATES</h2>
<p>
A search of the Congressional Quarterly data base, which tracks legislation 
in 50 states showed that 151 bills relating to the death penalty were 
submitted to state legislatures.  Seventeen were submitted in TN alone, 
13 in NY and 8 in IL.  In most instances duplicate bills were simultaneously 
submitted in both houses.  Bill duplication in the same chamber makes it 
obvious that some legislators are playing to the grandstands.  
<p>
The bills embody a variety of tactics to enlarge the reach of the death
penalty and speed executions.  Several affiliates informed us how the 
death penalty fared in their state: 
<p><blockquote>
<b>AR: </b> A bill that would require that death sentences be carried out by 
electrocution rather than lethal injection was withdrawn.  "Thank goodness 
the legislature only meets every other year!" says Rita Spellinger.
<p>
<b>CA: </b> According to Francisco Lobaco, The legislature provided that, in March 
1996, California voters will be asked to approve two capital punishment 
measures.  One applies the death penalty to murder in the course of a 
drive-by shooting, carjacking, or the killing of a juror.  In addition, death
penalty-related legislation introduced in the last session will again be 
considered in 1996.  They include death penalty sentencing for murder 
of a social worker or child abuse worker engaged in the performance of 
their duties; one setting time limits for appeals from a death sentence.  
"I expect to see many more death penalty related bills next year" says 
Francisco.   
<p>

<b>FL:</b>  An act was passed which defines a "career criminal" (someone 
convicted three times of certain crimes), and mandates various convictions, 
including the death penalty).  Death penalty-related bills (6 in the senate,
4 in the House) have been pre-filed for the 1996 session.  They would 
reform the Habeas Corpus petition process and add aggravating factors.  
Larry Helm Spalding says the Affiliate is monitoring and/or lobbying on 
these and related crime bills.  
<p>
<b>IL:</b>  Seven death penalty bills were filed (1 in the Senate, 6 in the House).
Mary Dixon  advises that all were sent to the Rules committees- 
presumably to resurrected in the next session.
<p>
<b>LA:</b>  A bill imposing the death penalty for rape of a victim under 12 became 
law in June.  A bill providing the time within which the state's supreme
court must decide a case where the death penalty has been imposed, and one 
providing the death penalty for rape of a victim over 65 will be on the next 
legislative calendar.
<p>
<b>MA:</b>  Abolitionists defeated yet another attempt to bring back the death 
penalty in MA.  The Affiliate was a pivotal part of the 20-member coalition 
that conducted a well-organized  grassroots and lobbying campaign.  
Norma Shapiro says the coalition found concerned allies, among 
religious organizations, lawyers (the Bar Association, the National 
Lawyers Guild), the MA criminal defense lawyers, sociologists, 
criminologists, Mds, etc.  
<p>
The MA coalition developed excellent lobbying materials, such as fact 
sheets based on conditions in Massachusetts, an excellent abolitionist 
booklet prepared by Chief Justice Hennessey (Retired), and made good 
use of a new poll by Northeastern University on the death penalty views 
of Massachusetts citizens.  The poll had found that few legislators or the 
public knew that the state has a provision for a sentence of life in prison 
without possibility of parole (LWOP).  [Call Travia for the above materials.]
<p>

The coalition's successful strategy principally targeted newly-elected 
legislators, and those who were uncommitted, and addressed the 
specific concerns of each.    
<p>
Norma notes that the abolitionist margin of victory dwindled from 16 
(last time) to 10.  Since 5 open seats will be filled this November, she is 
understandably cautious about claiming victory in advance on indubitable 
future attempts to revive the capital punishment statutes in Massachusetts.
<p>

<b>MN:</b>  The state abolished the death penalty in 1911; its last execution was 
in 1906.  The first week in December, the state Judiciary Committee held 
a hearing on a proposal to put the death penalty on the ballot in 1996. 
MN CLU's Kathleen Milner and other abolitionists helped plan the hearing.  
Former Mississippi prison warden Donald Cabana was among those who
testified in opposition to the death penalty.  Acording to a 1992 survey by 
the University of Minnesota, 70% of Minnesotans polled favor LWOP plus 
restitution of prison wages to a victim's family, to a sentence of death.  
<p>
During its 1995 session, the Minnesota House voted 96-37 against a crime 
bill amendment that would have reinstated the death penalty.  Recognizing 
that pro-death penalty forces are likely to try again, the abolitionist
coalition plans to work on a public education program aimed at raising 
opposition to the death penalty.  
<p>
<b>NY:</b>  The state's DP law took effect September 1. It applies to those
convicted of murdering a police officer, a prison guard or a judge, serial 
killing, murder committed with other felonies, like rape, and slaying by 
terrorists. The Act established a "Capital Defender Office" (CDO).  
Funded at $3.2 million this year, it conducts capital murder defenses in 
primary trials and state court appeals.  
<p>
By the end of October 31, 1995, the CDO had been notified of 102 murder 
cases that potentially qualify for the death sentence.  Of these, it has
taken on 8 cases; 7 were referred to outside lawyers.  The other 87 
accused may not face death:  the Bronx District Attorney appended notes 
to the 22 murder cases he referred to the CDO, stating he would not seek 
capital punishment because of his opposition thereto.  And in Manhattan, 
D.A. Morgenthau appointed a commission to help him make a decision on 
such a prosecution.  Thus, those who commit murder are death-eligible in 
one N.Y. county, not in another, starkly illustrating the capriciousness of 
death penalty yet again.
<p>
The N.Y. Times (12/14/95) reported that N.Y. Attorney General Dennis Vacco 
(who, at the time was in need of some good press) called for changing the 
law to render subject to execution someone caught with the raw materials 
for a nuclear bomb (ingredients yet to be determined!) -- a solution in
search of a problem?    
<p>
<b>TX:</b>  A bill mandating that a prosecutor must seek the death penalty for 
someone convicted of "an act of terror" passed the Senate unanimously, 
but did not pass the House, perhaps because it was submitted late in the 
session.  As did similar bills in several other states, the bill referred to
the Oklahoma City bombing.  According to Susan Maldonado, the TX 
legislature meets for 180 days every two years.  Thus the bill may be 
re-introduced in 1997.

<blockquote><h2>PROJECT ACTIVITIES</h2>
<p>
    The Project receives many letters requesting information or help from 
Death Row inmates.  The increasing population of death row and the 
de-funding of the PCDOs has increased the number of such letters.  
Most concern legal representation, the legal system, or conditions of 
imprisonment.  Some come from prisoners; some are forwarded from 
other organizations.  This year we received and answered more than 200.  
Some are answered by the Project's Legal Fellow, Hunter Labovitz.  Most 
do not require a technical legal answer, and are answered by Bob Vandivier.  
<p>
The Project tries to respond in timely fashion to each letter, drawing on 
regional legal resources as indicated, and to tailor the response to the 
individual request.  While the Project cannot provide legal representation, 
it often is able to learn enough through local inquiries to reassure the 
prisoner that his/her legal representation is doing what reasonably can 
be expected.  When the Project's inquiries suggest otherwise, 
sometimes our inquiry stimulates attention on the part of local resources. 
<p>
Readers are encouraged to help us keep track:  Please let us know of 
changes in requests for legal assistance in your state.
Bob Vandivier
<p>
  RESTORATIVE JUSTICE:  During the past year the Project's Phyllis 
Turner laid the basis for a conference that will discuss how victim 
restoration may impact criminal sentencing.  Several polls show that the 
possibility of making restoration to a victim's family on the part of a 
defendant decreases support for capital punishment.  In the long term 
this approach might enhance alternatives to death sentencing.  Despite 
Phyllis' departure (see below), ACLU will continue to participate in this 
project.  
<p>
     It is painful to announce that two colleagues are leaving the Project 
for greener fields!  Hunter Labovitz has accepted a position as staff 
attorney in Florida's Office of the Capital Collateral Representative (CCR).
<p>
This state-funded office provides direct representation in state and federal 
post-conviction proceedings to persons sentenced to death in Florida.  
We'll sorely miss Hunter's legal skills, his enthusiasm, his idealism, 
and his unflagging energy in the pursuit of civil rights in general, and 
abolitionist goals in particular.  We'll miss him, but our sense of loss is 
mitigated by the knowledge that his talents will be used to help the 
many Florida Death Row prisoners who so sorely need help.
<p>
Phyllis Turner has left us for a position with the National Organization for 
Victim Assistance.  Phyllis is a long-standing advocate of offender 
rehabilitation, and of victims' rights.  Her strong convictions, her 
enthusiasm, and her unexcelled networking abilities will be of great use 
to NOVA.  In her new position Phyllis will also continue her involvement 
with aspects of Restorative Justice relating to capital punishment.  We'll 
miss you, Phyllis!
<p>
There is good news as well:  Theresa Fuentas, a law student at George 
Washington University National Law Center has joined the Project as a 
part-time volunteer.  Before entering law school Theresa worked on civil 
liberties issues in New Jersey.  For us, Theresa will research and write 
on several issues relating to capital punishment.

<h2>FACTS AND SOURCES</h2>
  <p>
     Dick Dieter has done it again!  His Death Penalty Information Center 
has published yet another wonderful report.  A 35-page report with 93 
references,  With Justice for Few; The Growing Crisis in Death Penalty 
Representation spells out the reasons for the assertion that "[f]ar too
often, people are given the death penalty not for committing the worst 
crimes, but for having the worst lawyers."  With the increasing use of the 
death penalty,reduced opportunities of appeals, and severely reduced 
support for PCDOs this problem is becoming ever more acute.  DPIC's 
Justice for Few report provides timely and valuable ammunition.
  <p>
     Crime and Justice Policy Preferences, reports on a survey of
legislators' attitudes conducted by students of the College of 
Justice of Northeastern University.  Conducted in part to inform 
legislators considering reinstatement of the death penalty in 
Massachusetts, the students analyzed the legislators' thinking about 
the purposes of criminal punishment and appropriate punishment for 
first degree murder, including capital punishment and its alternatives. 
These were compared with those of Massachusetts citizens  (a 
different report).   The 115 legislators who participated in the survey 
represent a 58% participation rate.  Almost all felt that the seriousness 
of the crime and the offender's prior record should determine the severity of
the punishment.   74% of citizens and 45% of the legislators favored the
death penalty (i.e., they accepted, but did not necessarily favor it).
Legislators, like citizens, prefer Life in Prison without Parole (LWOP) to 
the death penalty.  When restitution is added, their support for capital 
punishment drops further from 37% to 26% of legislators (and from 
38% to 23% of citizens).
  <p>
Policy Preferences is an excellent and useful analysis of well-researched 
material.  For a copy, please call Travia.
  <p>
     Circumstantial Evidence by Pete Earley; published by Bantam Books, 
N.Y.; 1995.  describes Walter McMillian's road to Alabama's death row -- 
and his ultimate vindication with the help of Bryan Stevenson and the 
Alabama Resource Center.  Largely by-passed by the civil rights 
struggles of the early 60's, Monroeville was the setting for Harper 
Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, a fictional tale of
black-defendant-accused-of-murdering-female-white-teenager.
Mr. McMillian's ordeal bears an uncanny resemblance to the fictional tale.  
Monroeville is a town where whites see no race problem at all.  
African-Americans, facing racism every day, know better.  The racism that 
caused Mr. McMillian's conviction despite his innocence, was fueled by a 
vengeful erstwhile white lover, corrupt officials, who manufactured evidence 
and witness' statements, withheld evidence, and refused to give credence to 
the testimony of Mr. McMillian's friends and relatives who said he was at a 
party at his home at the time of the murder.  The racism is shown almost 
incidentally, but it's unmistakable.  Circumstantial Evidence is one of the
best books showing that racism fuels the machine of death, and the 
terrible possibility of killing the innocent.  Earley is an excellent writer;
this book reads like a murder mystery.  Each person is alive, and unique.  
Give it to acquaintances who need convincing that the death penalty must 
be abandoned.
  <p>
       The Death Penalty in the Nineties, An Examination of the Modern 
System of Capital Punishment, by Welsh S White, The University of 
ichigan Press, Ann Arbor, MI, 1987, 1991.  223 pp.  Provides an updated 
overview of the Supreme Court in the post-Furman era.  Many topics of 
importance to abolitionists are discussed.  Among these: miscarriage 
of justice; the continued racism; plea bargaining, the penalty phase of 
capital trials; defendants who elect execution; and the "death-qualified" 
jury.
  <p>
The author says the present system of capital punishment does not meet 
"reasonable standards of fairness," but presents information to enable 
readers to form their own judgment.
  <p>
An extensive critical review of this book was written by Deborah W. Denno 
(83 Crim. L. & Criminology 437 (Summer, 1992)).  After citing several more 
positive reviews, and stating that "White's scholarship and experience are 
unassailable," she provides a critique that includes an informative and 
provocative "fill in" and update.  For example, Ms. Denno expands on, and 
adds thoughtful analysis to White's treatment of the Supreme Court's 
"twisting" and reversal of the "death is different" doctrine. 
  <p>                                                                       
                                                        --- <i>Robert Vandivier</i>

  <h2>DEAD MAN WALKING</h2>
<P>
The movie, adapted from the book by abolitionist Sister Helen Prejean, 
has opened in Los Angeles and New York, and may be coming to a 
theater near you very soon.  The film's subject is likely to increase the 
public's focus on the death penalty, and thus provides an opportunity to 
do some public education on the need for abolition.  We've discussed 
how best to do this, and have developed some ideas:
<P>
       Arrange a pre- or post-movie discussion of the death penalty -- a
nearby library or restaurant might be the perfect spot.
<P>
      Arrange to have literature on the death penalty available for
distribution before and/or after the movie.  Live volunteers would probably 
be most effective, but even an "un-manned" literature table will do if need 
be.  
<P>
        When the movie is released on video, arrange for community showings 
and a discussion of the movie.  Have literature available, of course. 
<P>
      Review the movie for smaller, local or community papers and encourage 
people seeking more information to contact you or the Project.
<P>
      Comment on the movie in internet chat room conversations, alt. act. 
newsrooms, etc.  (We'll soon have something on ACLU's Constitution Hall 
on AOL).
<P>
We'd love to have some feedback from you to share with our readers in the 
next issue of the Abolitionist.  Let us know what you did,  and how it turned
out.  And of course, if you need materials, call Travia.  We have copies of
the briefing paper on the death penalty, the Double Justice video, and fact
sheets on innocence, and on general statistics.

<blockquote>
Even before the Democratic 103rd Congress turned into a 104th Congress
dominated by radical conservatives, the ACLU had been confronting a Capitol
Hill climate of growing hostility to civil liberties. And when the election
results of last November finished rolling in, the climate of hostility had
shifted to the dawning of an era marked by leaders who evince open contempt
for the Bill of Rights. 
<P>
The continued disdain and contempt for the Constitution and Bill of Rights
are quite amazing. When one Congressman attempted during debate last Spring
to insert the exact language of the Fourth Amendment into pending crime
legislation, his efforts were overwhelmingly rejected by the House.
Republicans and some Democrats seemed to fall lockstep behind the House
Speaker and his reactionary agenda, many elements of which passed without
hearings.
<P>
Legislators elected by voters to push through economic reforms are using
their newly found power to make the Constitution unenforceable, a result we
do not believe the electorate intended last November. For example, proposed
Constitutional amendments on flag "desecration" and religious expression
would reverse years of free speech victories and violate the separation of
church and state. As we come into the final stretch of the first session of
the 104th Congress, we have reason for strong concerns. In addition to the
assaults on the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment
and the independence and integrity of the federal judiciary are at risk.
<P>
Conservative representatives and senators are trying to use the
appropriations process -- funding bills which, according to House and Senate
rules, are to be free of social legislation -- to push forward their
anti-liberty agenda. One appropriations bill would force HUD to stop
investigating and prosecuting insurance redlining. Another appropriations
bill would devastate affirmative action programs. They have called for -- and
in many cases approved -- laws that would permit and encourage warrantless
searches and seizures, deny women the right to choose abortion, and deny
incarcerated juveniles, women and men whose rights have been violated
effective access to court remedies.
<P>
It is this political environment, in which we face new legislative and
constitutional crises each day, which "welcomes" you to the Legislative section of the site.
The prospect for reform may seem insurmountable.  But there are cracks in the
leadership's armor and civil libertarians have had small victories to build
upon.  At this crucial time in the legislative agenda, committed civil
libertarians like you can help us make a clear difference -- by reminding
Senators and Representatives of the constitutional principles at stake in the
bills they are addressing, by influencing "moderate" Members of Congress who
have not yet staked out positions on pending civil liberties legislation, and
by reinforcing the leadership of the remaining civil libertarians in
Congress.
<P>
To help you prepare for
this fight we have put together a series of
background briefings on several of the most important issues facing the civil
liberties community today. There are many more civil liberties issues we
could discuss, but we've chosen matters that will be most pertinent during
the near term. 
<P>
On behalf of the entire national office of the ACLU, let me say that we, as always,
thank you for your crucial support.

<br>Director, Washington National Office

<blockquote>
<P>
     Members of Congress rarely hear from their constituents on
most issues. Sometimes hearing from a handful of concerned citizens
will cause a Senator or Representative to pay attention to a
particular issue and encourage him or her to vote the right way.
<P>
     In general the more personal your lobbying contact is, the
more effective it will be. While a personal discussion with a
Member of Congress is most effective, a meeting or telephone
conversation with one of his or her assistants is almost as good.
A personal letter or email is much more effective than a form letter or
postcard.
<P>
     You do not need to be an expert on the issue to call or write
your Member of Congress' office. All you need to communicate is
that you want the Member to support or oppose a particular measure.
When you call a Member's office give your name and address and ask
whomever takes your call to let the Member of Congress know that
you favor or oppose something.
<P>
     It is very important that you lobby both Members of Congress
who may support your views AND those who may not. Lobbying can
change votes so it is critically important that you lobby those who
disagree with you. Lobbying supporters provides them with evidence
of support for their position and allows them to be more active in
support of that position.

<B><A NAME="tour">Courtroom Internet Tour In First Challenge to State Cyber-Censorship Law</A></B>

<P>
On Thursday, January 30 a courtroom hearing on the first-ever challenge to a
state Internet censorship statute, included a live tour of the Internet for a
federal district judge.
</P>

<P>
Hans Klein, a professor of technology and public policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology, presented a guided tour of the Internet to Judge Marvin Shoob of the Northern District Court of Georgia. Prof. Klein testifies on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union, which along with Electronic Frontiers Georgia (EFGA), Georgia State Representative Mitchell Kaye and others, filed a challenge to a Georgia law criminalizing free speech in cyberspace.
</P>

<P>
The law, which was passed by the Georgia General Assembly last year and became
effective on July 1, 1996, provides criminal sanctions of up to 12 months in
jail and/or up to a $1,000 fine for violations.
</P>

<P>
Today marks only the third time that an evidentiary hearing has included an
online tour in a case challenging an Internet censorship law. The first such
"cyber-tour" was conducted before a three-judge panel in federal district court
in Philadelphia during ACLU v. Reno, the challenge to the federal Internet
censorship law now scheduled for Supreme Court review in March. A second case
challenging the same law in a New York court, Shea v. Reno, included a similar
Internet tour.

"Despite the explosive growth of the Internet, many people still have not been
online and do not fully understand the extraordinarily positive features of this
new medium," said Christopher Hansen, an ACLU national staff attorney.
</P>

<P>
"When courts are called upon to decide the rules for what one judge called 'the
most participatory form of mass speech yet developed,' it is especially
important that they formulate a clear understanding of the nature of that
medium," he added.

<B><A NAME="OECD">OECD Crypto Policy Not As Good As Expected</A></B>
</P>

<P>
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) crypto policy
is not as good as civil libertarians, privacy advocates and other
pro-cryptography groups had expected, according to a report obtained by Reuters.
While the OECD did not fully accept the Clinton Administration key escrow and
key recovery proposals, they also did not oppose government access to keys.
Governments instead are told to weigh the costs and benefits of key recovery. 
</P>

<P>
Earlier draft policies had stronger privacy recommendations in place.
</P>

<P>
"We are very troubled that the OECD panel has apparently weakened its privacy
principles under pressure from the US government. The Clinton Administration
should end its shameful policy of forcing key escrow on the world while our own
political and industry leaders are rejecting it at home." said ACLU Associate
Director Barry Steinhardt.

<B><A NAME="karn">Karn Crypto Case Sent Back to Lower Court</A></B>
</P>

<P>
On January 21, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded the
appeal of Phil Karn back to the lower court. The case started after the State
Department denied Karn's application for an export licence. He wanted to export
a disk to accompany Bruce Schneier's Applied Cryptography text. The disk
contained verbatim electronic copies of the source code from the book, but the
same material that can be exported in printed form was barred from being
exported in electronic form. 
</P>

<P>
The earlier decision was based on  State Department cryptography regulations,
but the Executive Branch recently issued new regulations moving the
adminstration of cryptography export from State to the Commerce Department.
Rather than hear the case now, the Appeals Court asked the lower court to rule
on the case under the new regulations.
</P>

<P>
The ACLU submitted an amicus brief in the Karn appeal, in conjunction with EPIC,
ISOC and USACM. The brief can be found at

<B><A NAME="baker">6th Circuit Affirms Dismissal of Charges Against Jake Baker</A></B>

<P>
Jake Baker, the first person to be criminally charged for Internet writings, was
vindicated Wednesday by a federal court ruling that his communications were
constitutionally protected free speech, the Detroit Free Press reports.
</P>

<P>
The former University of Michigan student wrote on the Internet about raping,
torturing and murdering women. But he didn't threaten them, the Court ruled
Wednesday. 
</P>

<P>
In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Cincinnati
upheld a June 1995 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Avern Cohn in Detroit
dismissing charges against Baker. Cohn had said the writings were
constitutionally protected free speech.
</P>

<P>
Civil libertarians, who feared unconstitutional regulation of the vast reaches
of cyberspace, cheered the ruling. 
</P>

<P>
 "The values of the First Amendment must be protected even in cyberspace,"
Howard Simon, executive director of the Michigan American Civil Liberties Union,
told the Free Press.
</P>

<P>
 "The court's ruling reinforces the distinction between fantasies and threats.
Fantasies --- even sick fantasies -- are free speech, threats are criminal
behavior," Simon said. "That's the crucial distinction upheld by the Court of
Appeals in affirming the federal court's earlier decision."
</P>

<P>
 The ACLU of Michigan filed briefs urging that charges by dropped against Baker
with the U.S. District Court in Detroit and the appeals court in Cincinnati.

<A NAME="ok"><B>Oklahoma Professor Loses Suit to Lift Restrictions on University Computers
</B></A><P>
Professor Bill Loving took the University of Oklahoma to court after they
blocked usenet's alt.sex hierarchy. While the University claimed to be concerned
about violating an Oklahoma stat law, Loving argued that this restriction was a
form of censorship, and constituted a prior restraint on speech.
</P>

<P>
But last week U.S. District Judge Wayne Alley held that Loving's constitutional
rights had not been violated when the server access was shut off, and that
Oklahoma had the same rights as a private actor would to control its property,
and could make decisions to block this kind of use. 
</P>

<P>
The University has now established two servers, and does provide unlimited
Internet access on one of them. However, access to that server is restricted to
people over the age of 18 who can prove they have an academic reason for needing
the expanded access. "Without reaching any conclusions about the action of the
defendant, the court determines that, the plaintiff has not shown that his
constitutional rights were violated," Alley stated in the verdict.
</P>

<P>
The University's policy limiting full access to people over 18 with an "academic
need" for it is troublesome said ACLU Staff Attorney Ann Beeson. "Historically
the university has been a place of robust debate and discussion even outside the
classroom. The policy's requirement that internet access  be restricted to
academic research would stifle online  discussion of the sort that takes place
every day on college campuses," she said.
</P>

<P>
Loving plans to appeal the verdict.

<B><A NAME="MD">Maryland Bill Would Make it illegal to Send Annoying or Embarrassing Email
</A></B><P>
Representative Samuel Rosenberg has once again introduced a bill into the
Maryland State Legislature that would make it illegal to send email that would
"annoy" or "embarrass" the recipients, among other things. When the same bill
was introduced in the last session of the legislature it went nowhere, but
Rosenberg and others are attempting to play on public fears about the Internet,
and are hoping to successfully get it through the legislature.
</P>

<P>
Connecticut has already passed a similar piece of legislation, and there are
concerns that this issue may arise in other states as well.
</P>

<P>
The last time this bill was introduced, the ACLU of Maryland sent a letter to
members of the legislature urging them to vote against it. They are considering
the best way to address the reintroduction of the  legislation.

<P>
The ACLU said that the annoy.com case will not affect the ACLU challenge to the
CDA, but that they welcomed all efforts to protect free speech on the Internet.
Oral arguments  before the Supreme Court in Reno v. ACLU are scheduled for March
19.

<A name="reno"><H3> Reno v. ACLU Update: Government's Brief Asserts Unprecedented
  Powers to criminalize Online Speech</h3></A>
<P>
	After reviewing the Justice Department's brief on the Communications Decency Act filed late yesterday with the U.S. Supreme Court, the ACLU said that the government is seeking unprecedented powers to criminalize speech on the Internet.
<P>
	The ACLU said that the government's 55-page brief in Reno v. ACLU is "at odds with the extensive factual findings of the trial court," which ruled last June that censorship provisions of the CDA unconstitutionally restricted free speech. 
<P>
	"The government's arguments, if adopted, would justify blanket censorship not just on the Internet, but in traditional forums such as libraries and bookstores," said Christopher Hansen, an ACLU national staff attorney on the Reno v. ACLU legal team. 
<P>
	Further, he noted that the government's brief makes the astounding claim that it is protecting the First Amendment by censoring free speech on the Internet, asserting that a fear of encountering "indecency" online could deter potential users from exercising their First Amendment interest in accessing the new medium.
<P>
	"It is supremely ironic that the government now says it is protecting the First Amendment rights of Americans by threatening people with jail for engaging in constitutionally protected speech," Hansen said. 
<P>
	The kind of "indecency" identified by government witnesses in the lower court included words and images displayed online by organizations such as the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, Stop Prisoner Rape, Human Rights Watch and Critical Path AIDS Project, all plaintiffs in Reno v. ACLU, Hansen  said. 
<P>
	The Supreme Court announced today that it would hear oral argument in the case on Wednesday,  March 19, at 10:00 a.m.   Each side will be given a half-hour to present their arguments.  According to the briefing schedule set by the Court, plaintiff's answering briefs are due on February 20. The government's final, or reply brief, is due on March 7.    
<P>
	In addition to the government's brief, three sets of plaintiff groups filed friend-of-the-court briefs on Tuesday in support of the government's position: Enough is Enough (along with eight other plaintiffs), Morality in Media, and a group of members of Congress led by former Senator J. James Exon (D-Neb.), who sponsored the Communications Decency Act.
<P>

	Complete information on the ACLU's challenge to the CDA, including a chronology, trial briefs, affidavits, courtroom transcripts, and a backgrounder on Supreme Court procedures in the case, are available online at the ACLUs website (http://www.aclu.org) and America Online site (keyword: ACLU).

<H3><A name="ala">ACLU Files Suit against New York State Internet Censorship Law</h3>

	The American Civil Liberties Union, the New York Civil Liberties Union, the American Library Association and others last week  filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction against a New York statute criminalizing free speech in cyberspace.
<P>
 	At an interactive news conference, the groups said they were filing suit because the law, aimed at shielding minors from "indecency," is an unconstitutional content-based restriction on free speech that would reduce adult communications to levels acceptable for a six-year-old.
<P>
 	The ACLU said that the New York law is similar to the federal Communications Decency Act, which the ACLU, the ALA and others successfully challenged in federal district court in Philadelphia after it became law last February. In addition, a separate three-judge panel in New York found the CDA unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds. The Philadelphia case, Reno v. ACLU, is currently under review by the Supreme Court, and the New York case is pending in the Supreme Court.
<P>
 	Section 235.21(3) of the New York Penal Law, which became effective on November 1, 1996, makes it a crime to disseminate "indecent" materials that are "harmful to minors" through any computer communications network.
 <P>
 "Like the federal CDA, the New York law is technically and economically infeasible to enforce, it blocks speech that has value to a great many people, and it ignores effective alternatives available both to protect children and to protect free speech," said Ann Beeson, an ACLU national staff attorney and member of the Reno v. ACLU litigation team. The ACLU is also lead counsel in ALA v. Pataki.
<P>
      "Anyone who thinks children will be protected by this law is sadly mistaken," Beeson said. "Experts estimate that at least 40 per cent of information on the Internet originates from non-U.S. sites, which minors will still be able to access. The only group this law really protects is politicians, who can claim they are passing 'tough' legislation. Everyone else is out in the cold."
<P>
 	Today's lawsuit is the second such challenge to a state cybercensorship law, according to the ACLU. The first was filed by the ACLU and others in September against a statute in Georgia, now scheduled to go to trial in late January. The ACLU said it has been monitoring state regulation of the Internet and that currently, over 20 states have considered such laws.
<P>
	Plaintiffs in the case are the American Library Association, the Freedom to Read Foundation, the New York Library Association, the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, Westchester Library System, BiblioBytes, Association of American Publishers, Interactive Digital Software Association, Magazine Publishers of America, Public Access Networks Corp. (PANIX), ECHO, NYC Net, Art on the Net, Peacefire and the American Civil Liberties Union.

<A name="ga"><H3> Georgia Internet Case Update</H3>
</A>

	An evidentiary hearing is scheduled for January 30 in  ACLU v. Miller, the ACLU challenge to a Georgia Internet law. The Georgia law makes it a crime to use a name that "falsely identifies" a speaker on the Internet, without distinguishing whether the person communicating had any intent to deceive or defraud or simply wanted to keep his or her identity unknown. 
<P>
	The complaint also states that the law may prohibit web links by making it a crime to publish information "using" trade names, logos or other symbols, again without regard to the nature of the use, and without any definition of what constitutes "use" on a computer network. 
<P>
	At the January 30 hearing an expert witness for the ACLU is scheduled to demonstrate the Internet to the court.

<h3><a name="NWU"> Northwestern University Defends Free Speech on the Internet</a></h3>
<P>
	The ACLU congratulates Northwestern University for its stance in support of free speech. Recently, controversy arose around the web page of Associate Professor Arthur R. Butz, who had posted Holocaust revisionist opinions to his page on the university's servers. Despite numerous complaints, the University declined to ask the professor to remove the web page, and when pushed on the topic referred to campus policy on intellectual freedom as it relates to computer usage:
<blockquote>
	Intellectual Freedom: The network is a free and open forum
 	for the expression of ideas, including viewpoints that are strange,
	unorthodox, or unpopular. The network administrators place no 
	official sanctions upon the expression of personal opinion on 
	the network. However, such opinions may not be represented as 
	views of Northwestern University. 
</blockquote>
As the University stated, Professor Butz made it clear that he was presenting his own views and in no way representing the views of the University, and any censorship was therefore inappropriate. The ACLU supports such free speech codes for university computers.

<H3><A NAME="crypto">Encryption Decision Overturns Clinton Rules</A></H3>

<P>
	Adding what the Los Angeles Times called a "new twist to the battle over
government restrictions on data-scrambling technology," a federal judge has
ruled that government regulations barring the export of encryption software
are an unconstitutional violation of free speech.
</P>

<P>
	Ruling in favor of Daniel Bernstein, an Illinois math professor who attempted to publish his encryption codes on the Internet, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in San Francisco recently struck down the government regulations as a "paradigm of standardless discretion" that failed to protect First Amendment rights. 
</P>

<P>
	While saying it is still analyzing the Bernstein decision, the ACLU welcomed it as "extraordinarily important for its holding that computer source code is protected speech and for the Judge's willingness to look beyond the
government's claim that export controls were justified by 'national security.'"
</P>

<P>
	In its report on the decision, the Washington Post said that encryption software -- which allows people to turn their telephone conversations and data into virtually uncrackable code -- has been at the heart of one of the hardest-fought technology controversies for the Clinton administration. Despite protests from the computer industry, the government restricts its export on the grounds that it could aid criminals and terrorists.
</P>

<P>
	The government is likely to appeal the Bernstein decision to the Federal Court of Appeals and, if it does, the ACLU said that it would once again file a friend-of-the-court brief on Bernstein's behalf. The ACLU has already appeared as a friend-of-the-court in a parallel case, Karn v. US, which will be argued early next year in the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

<H3><A NAME="sd">South Dakota Governor Blocks E-Mail Petitions</A></H3>
</P>

<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union is poised to take action against the state of South Dakota,  charging that it violated the U.S. Constitution when it blocked e-mail from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) whose customer was sending mass mailings.
</P>

<P>
	The controversy arose early in December when a Michigan woman found that the petitions she was e-mailing to officials in South Dakota were being bounced back to her.  The reason her petitions were blocked, said the press secretary for Governor Bill Janklow of South Dakota, was that they were protesting phantom legislation that had never been proposed.
</P>

<P>
	The woman, Linda LeMonde, is an American Indian activist who became alarmed about what she thought was a proposal to prohibit Native American ceremonies on state forest land in South Dakota and to limit the number of American Indians who could assemble at gatherings.  According to the Governor's office, no such legislation was under consideration.
</P>

<P>
	But when South Dakota blocked all e-mail coming from Technology Dimensions because a customer of the ISP was forwarding mass e-mail petitions to government employees, it violated the Constitution, ACLU attorney Ann Beeson told C/Net News.  
</P>

<P>
	"We believe that South Dakota's efforts to restrict e-mail access to government officials is a violation of the First Amendment and citizens' rights to petition their government," she said.
</P>

<P>
	In a December 18 letter to Governor Janklow, the ACLU strongly urged the Governor to lift the block and provide full access to all citizens seeking to communicate by e-mail.  
</P>

<P>
	According to the letter, the e-mail block, "if accurately reported, implicate[s] both the right to free speech and the right to petition the government."   The letter was signed by ACLU national staff attorneys Ann Beeson and Steve Pevar. 
</P>

<P>
	Jim Soyer, spokesman for Governor Janklow, defended the state's move, telling C/Net News that government employees were being flooded with petitions filled with inaccuracies.  
</P>

<P>
	But in its letter, the ACLU pointed out that such a block is content-based discrimination: "As the [Supreme] Court has repeatedly held, the government may not censor speech solely because it believes the speech to be inaccurate," the ACLU noted. 
</P>

<P>
	According to Beeson, to date the ACLU has received no meaningful response from the Governor's office and legal action is still an option.    
</P>

<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="cybersitter"> CYBERsitter blocks Peacefire.org</A></H3>
</P>

<P>
	Commercially available blocking software is designed to prevent access to web sites that are deemed inappropriate, but just what is inappropriate? Bennett Haselton, a student at Vanderbilt University who also runs the Peacefire.org web site, installed a copy of CYBERsitter, and was surprised at some of the sites it blocked. CYBERsitter blocked, among other sites, the National Organization for Women, and all web pages on large ISP's such as Echo and the WELL. When Bennett complained, CYBERsitter blocked his site as well. 

</P>	
<P>
	Peacefire.org is a civil liberties membership organization for young people. They are now blocked by CYBERsitter presumably because Bennett brought them so much negative publicity. 
</P>

<P>
	CYBERsitter will not release a list of the sites it blocks, and just recently it released a revised version of the guidelines it follows in deciding what to censor. The guideline are vague enough that CYBERsitter can essentially censor whatever it wants. While as a private company CYBERsitter can block what it chooses, the ACLU believes it should provide clear information about what it blocks and why, so consumers can make informed decisions about whether to use the product.
</P>

<P>
	Bennett is continuing to bring publicity to these issues. He, and Peacefire, will be plaintiffs in the ACLU's upcoming challenge to the New York State version of the CDA. His web site can be found at http://www.peacefire.org
</P>

<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="fla"> ACLU of Florida looks at Library Use of Blocking Software</A></H3>
</P>

<P>
	In another incident regarding blocking software and its application, the ACLU of Florida is looking into complaints against the Orange County, Florida, Library system. The Library system has about 70 terminals that have web access. The library administrators were concerned because the terminals were used, among other things, to view pornography.
</P>

<P>
	In an attempt to deal with this situation the library installed a web blocking program called WebSense on their machines. Unlike CYBERsitter, WebSense is designed for corporate, rather than home use. Also unlike CYBERsitter, WebSense divides the sites it filters into 28 broad categories, and allows the person controlling the program to decide which categories to block. But the library does not allow adult patrons, or minors with parental permission, to modify or switch off the program while surfing the web.
</P>

<P>
	The ACLU does not object to the use of blocking software on public library terminals, as long as the software can be turned off at adult patrons' request.
</P>

<P>
	Andy Kayton, Legal Director of the ACLU of FLorida, has been in touch with the library in the hopes of resolving the situation. However if the library refuses to give citizens uncensored access to the internet, litigation is an option, he said.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="OECD"> OECD Expert Group Finalizes Cryptography Guidelines</A></H3>
</P>

<P>
	An Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) expert group, created to draft cryptography guidelines has finished its work. The guidelines focus on eight principles for cryptography policy: 
<UL>
		<LI> Trust in cryptographic methods 
		<LI> Choice of cryptographic methods 
		<LI> Market driven development of cryptographic methods 
		<LI> Standards for cryptographic methods 
		<LI> Protection of privacy and personal data 
		<LI> Lawful access
		<LI> Liability 
		<LI> International co-operation
</UL>
	These guidelines will be forwarded to the Council of the OECD in spring 1997 for approval as a formal Recommendation of the OECD. GILC and the ACLU held a conference in Paris in September during the OECD group's gathering which contributed to a favorable climate for the guidelines.

<P>
I am going to be travelling in December, and will be unable to publish a Cyber-Liberties Update on December 11. If there is major breaking news while I am away, Lynn Decker of the ACLU Public Education Department will send email to this list about it. Otherwise, the next Update will be just after Christmas.
</P>

<P>
Once again I would like to encourage all of you to take a look at our New York State Chill Page. It contains information about the New York State version of the CDA, and includes a form where you can tell us how the New York State law is effecting your speech online. It can be found at http://www.aclu.org/action/nychill.html

<A NAME="ga"><H3> Plaintiffs File Reply Brief in Georgia Internet Case</H3></A>

<P>
The Georgia Internet case -- which challenges a Georgia law that bans online
pseudonyms and prohibits certain links on the Web -- is proceeding apace.
On November 26, 1996, Plaintiffs filed reply briefs in response to the
State's earlier briefs.  The State had exhibited a fundamental
misunderstanding of both cyberspace and the First Amendment -- for example,
they argued that casual speech in chat rooms on the Internet was not
protected speech.  Plaintiffs' briefs also explained the fatal flaws in the
State's attempt to radically re-write the statute to apply only to
intentional fraud and deception.
</P>

<P>
To clarify some of the factual disputes about the nature of cyberspace,
Plaintiffs have asked the Court to hold an evidentiary hearing on their
motion for a preliminary injunction against the Georgia Act.  The hearing
would probably be set for early next year.
</P>

<P>
The lawsuit was filed in late September on behalf of 13 plaintiffs,
including the ACLU of Georgia, Electronic Frontiers Georgia, Representative
Mitchell Kaye, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  The recent briefs
and other case documents are available at:

<H3><A NAME="cato"> Cato Study Says Internet Cannot Be Constitutionally Regulated</A></H3>

<P>
In the first study to look beyond the pending ACLU court challenge to censorship on the Internet, the Cato Institute has published a study that examines and rejects as unconstitutional many remaining proposals for government controls on cyberspace.
</P>

<P>
The study, Beyond the Communications Decency Act: Constitutional Lessons of the Internet, was prepared by Solveig Bernstein, assistant director of telecommunications and technology studies at Cato. "No regulation of computer network indecency should pass constitutional scrutiny," Bernstein concludes.
</P>

<P>
The ACLUs National Washington Office welcomed the Cato study, saying that there is already discussion among some members of Congress about legislative attempts to censor the Internet should the Supreme Court strike down the so-called Communications Decency Act.
</P>

<P>
Moments after the CDA was signed by President Clinton last year, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against it in federal district court in Philadelphia. A three-judge panel overturned the law, but the Clinton Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to review that decision. A decision from the Justices on whether they will review Reno v. ACLU is expected soon.
</P>

<P>
"We must all be wary of future efforts to hijack free-speech supporters into backing new censorship schemes," said Donald Haines, an ACLU Legislative Counsel who works on privacy and Internet regulation. "We need to tell Congress that true friends of the Net are not interested in a "better" way to censor it. We oppose Net censorship because it's wrong and unnecessary." 
</P>

<P>
Specifically, the Cato study rejects as unconstitutional legislation that would ban speech deemed "harmful to minors" and proposals to force content providers to label and rate their sites for content. 
</P>

<P>
"For spontaneous computer speech," Bernstein says, mandatory labeling would be "the equivalent of requiring the labeling of conversations around a backyard barbecue."
</P>

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="EO"> White House Issues New Executive Order on Cryptography</A></H3>

<P>
On November 15, the White House released a new Executive Order regulating cryptography exports. The new policy, temporarily relaxing the export restrictions on encryption technology, was first announced by Vice President Al Gore on October 1. It only relaxes the export policy for companies taking steps to make the keys available to the government.
</P>

<P>
This EO moves export determinations on most cryptography products from the State Department to the Commerce Department. While it does not specifically state what Commerce will licence, Gore's earlier announcement indicated that Commerce will allow exports of cryptography products using keys up to 56 bits in length (up from the current 40 bit limit). To get these licenses, companies must agree to work to develop key recovery programs.
</P>

<P>
Key recovery describes an arrangement in which the government can get access to the keys needed to break the encryption. Copies of the keys, or enough information to determine the keys, are stored with the government or with third parties. This means the government can get the keys, and therefore can decrypt any data they protect.
</P>

<P>
Additionally, while authority is being transferred from State to Commerce, the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, Justice  and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency will have the opportunity to review export licence applications. These agencies, especially Justice, have never been friendly towards cryptography.
</P>

<P>
This new policy is insidious. It creates a great deal of pressure for large technology companies to work towards developing key recovery systems. If they work towards that goal they will be able to produce one version of their software for both domestic and international use. If they are not granted export licenses they will either have to produce different software for the different markets, or eliminate the cryptography functions in their domestic products so they can export them. The EO states that this is all for national security, and to limit the international spread of crypto, but the Commerce department is barred from considering whether the same technology, or crypto technology of an equal strength, is already available overseas, in its normal review process. 
</P>

<P>
At the same time as issuing the new EO, Clinton also designated Ambassador David L. Aaron as the new "Special Envoy for Cryptography." While Congress will not pass key escrow legislation, the establishment of a "crypto czar" is part of the campaign to enshrine key escrow into law through bilateral and multinational treaties.
</P>

<P>
The ACLU opposes this latest Administration policy, and is very concerned about the potential for privacy abuses when the government can access the keys to decrypt protected data.
</P>

					Cyberpromo v. AOL
				</A>
			</H3>
			</P>
			<P>
			A District Court in Pennsylvania has ruled that AOL is not a state actor subject to the First Amendment, and therefore can block unsolicited commercial e-mail (spam). 
			</P>
			<P>
			Cyber Promotions, Inc. (Cyberpromo) had been sending literally millions of pieces of unsolicited e-mail to AOL users at their AOL addresses. When AOL began blocking all e-mail sent from Cyberpromo's domains, the company filed suit in the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Judge Charles Weiner initially issued a temporary restraining order barring AOL from blocking Cyberpromo. 
			</P>
			<P>
			After the issues were briefed Judge Weiner found that there were no disputes over the facts of the case, and issued a summary judgment opinion. He held that AOL is not a state actor, and is not working in conjunction with the government. As a wholly private actor, AOL is not required to open its network to Cyberpromo, and is therefore within its rights to block e-mail from the Cyberpromo's domains. Additionally, Judge Weiner stressed that there are other ways for Cyberpromo to reach the same audience, including through traditional marketing methods such as postal mail, and that this ruling does not close off all means of communication. 
			</P>
			<P>
			Even before the decision, AOL switched gears and created PreferredMail -- a filter that blocks mail from Cyber Promotions and several other sites that regularly send out unsolicited commercial mail. Users can turn off the filter if they want to receive it.
			</P>
			<P>
			Cyberpromo may have lost its First Amendment case, but it hasn't given up yet. The company has now filed a new motion alleging that the PreferredMail filter violates federal anti-trust laws. They have not decided whether to appeal the decision.

				<A NAME="webtv">
					Web TV -- A Web Browser or a Munition?
				</A>
			</H3>
			</P>
			<P>
			The latest victim in the U.S. government's push to control encryption technology is Web TV -- a set-top box that allows people to browse the Internet using their TV sets. In order to protect the privacy of the users, and to enable secure online transactions, the boxes encode the information that moves between the users and the Web TV server. 
			</P>
			<P>
			Building in security and privacy is great, but has unfortunately created a problem for the manufacturers. The government classifies strong encryption technology as a munition, and bars its export. The Clinton Administration's latest proposal will allow the export of encryption products with a key up to 56 bits as long as the exporting company agrees to build in "key recovery systems" -- back doors for the government to access encoded data. 
			</P>
			<P>
			Web TV uses a 128 bit key, which is much more secure than the 56 bit keys for which the government will grant export licenses. It may look like a harmless TV adapter, but the Clinton Administration considers it a dangerous munition, and is highly unlikely to grant an export license.
			</P>
			<P>
			The companies that manufacture the set-top boxes had planned to export them to Europe and Japan next year, but are now unlikely to do so. The U.S. cryptography export regulations create strong incentives against incorporating cryptography into products built in the U.S., and may well encourage companies to move overseas to develop products that require security and privacy.

					Japan Tightens Cryptography Export Regulations
				</A>
			</H3>
			</P>
			<P>
			In what could be a major setback for privacy and free speech online, the Japanese government has greatly tightened its export controls on cryptographic products.
			</P>
			<P>
			The U.S. government's longstanding hostility towards cryptography is well known, from its oft aborted clipper proposals, to the current block on the export of Web TV (see story above). 
			</P>
			<P>
			Civil libertarians and others who support the use of cryptography have often thought that the export limitations issue would become moot with regard to international availability of cryptography, although they would continue to create problems for U.S. businesses and block them from participating in foreign markets. 
			</P>
			<P>
			The problem is that now Japan -- at the urging of the U.S. -- is also limiting export of encryption technology. Increased limits overseas make it even more important to work domestically towards a removal of the ban on encryption exports.
			</P>

				<A NAME="ga">
					Government's Reply in Georgia
				</A>
			</H3>
			</P>
			<P>
			On November 8, the State of Georgia filed its reply brief in the Internet lawsuit brought by the ACLU, Electronic Frontiers Georgia, and other groups. The suit challenges a law making it a crime to "falsely identify" oneself online, among other things. (see story in the Cyber-Liberties Update from October 3, on the web at http://www.aclu.org/issues/cyber/updates/)
			</P>
			<P>
			The Government's argues that the statute is not as broad as it seems, and merely eliminates intentional fraud and misrepresentation online. But the language in the statute actually goes way beyond eliminating fraud and misrepresentation -- it also bars anonymous use of the internet, or the use of a pseudonym. The language of the statute also would make it illegal to link to a corporate web page using the corporation's logo, whether that use has "intentionally" related to fraud, or not.
			</P>
			<P>
			The ACLU also argues that since the Internet inherently functions across state lines, and is fundamentally interstate commerce, state governments are constitutionally barred from regulating it by the Commerce Clause. Georgia argues that they have the power to regulate criminal activity that affects their citizens within the state borders, and that doing so does not violate the Commerce Clause.
			</P>
			<P>
			Arguments in the case may be scheduled as early as December, but are more likely to happen early next year.

 Room 2705<BR>
 Washington, D.C. 20230.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
<B>Comments on Interim Rule on Encryption Items Transferred From the U.S.
Munitions List to the Commerce Control List<BR>
</B> <BR>
The ACLU is a nonpartisan organization with 275,000 members nationwide and affiliates in every
state, whose sole purpose is to defend and enhance the principles of freedom and liberty embodied
in the United States Constitution.  Supporting the First Amendment right of free speech is a crucial
part of our mission.<BR>
 <BR>
 We believe the new Interim Rule on Encryption Items Transferred From the U.S. Munitions List
to the Commerce Control List (December 30, 1996, 61 FR 68572) to be an irreparable
infringement on First Amendment rights.  Export  restrictions on cryptography are a prior restraint
on protected speech, and  are a content based gag on Constitutionally protected speech. Prior
restraints on speech and attempts to regulate speech based  on content are anathema to the
Constitution, and thus we urge the removal of  encryption products from the export restrictions
altogether.<BR>
 <BR>
The new regulations are functionally equivalent to the prior regulatory scheme which was held to
be unconstitutional on December 16, 1996, in <U>Bernstein v. Department of State </U> in the District
Court for the Northern District of California in a ruling by Judge Marilyn Hall Patel.<BR>
 <BR>
With respect to cryptography, Judge Patel found the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
(ITAR) to be "... a paradigm of standardless discretion".<P>
The rules under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are no better. There are still no
adequate controls on the licensors - rather they are to review the materials on a "case-by case basis.
While EAR does have procedural safeguards that were lacking under ITAR, cryptography is
exempted from most of them. The same "lack of constraints on approving or denying a license" the
Federal Court cited still  apply.<BR>
 <BR>
While there are national security concerns raised by the government, those concerns are not
sufficient to create grounds for a prior restraint on speech. The decision of the Federal<BR>
Court stressed that the holdings in the Pentagon Papers case are applicable to cryptography. The
Supreme Court has set an extremely exacting standard for determining when national security can
be a valid reason for lifting the constitutional bar on prior restraints, and the court found ITAR's
vague national security language to be "clearly insufficient." That holding applies directly to the
national security concerns behind the new regulation as well.<BR>
 <BR>
 In referring to the Snuffle encryption algorithm, the decision of the Federal<BR>
Court stated that:<BR>
 <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Software relating to encryption is simply a topic of speech employed by some
scientists involved in applied research. Hence, Snuffle is speech afforded the full
protection of the First Amendment not because it enables encryption, but because it
is itself speech.
</BLOCKQUOTE> <P>
The Free Speech Guarantee of the United States Constitution, with or without the stunningly clear
Federal Court ruling, provides encryption the same protection as other speech. The proposed
regulations restrict that speech and are unconstitutional.  To  contort legislative authority in an
unrelated subject area in order to violate the nation's fundamental law is never acceptable, but to do
so on the heels of the Federal Court decision affirming constitutional protections for encryption is
both authoritarian and utterly lawless.<BR>
 <BR>
In 1991 the Supreme Court reaffirmed its 1984 declaration that "[r]egulations which permit the
Government to discriminate on the basis of the content of the message cannot be tolerated under the
First Amendment."Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State Crime Victims
Board, 112 S.Ct. 501 (1991).  While bans on encryption exports have been called content neutral,
they do in fact  block speech due to its cryptographic content. The Federal Court's decision stated
that "the very nature of the technology blurs the distinction between these two ways of
understanding the constitutionality of a regulation," noting that the stronger an encryption scheme
is the more noteworthy it is as academic speech.<BR>
 <BR>
The Federal Court's decision stresses the expressive value of cryptography, and the
unconstitutionality of the licensing scheme applied to this speech. While the ruling applies to the
prior cryptography licensing scheme, the First Amendment issues are not significantly altered
under the new arrangement. The provisions requiring the prior licensing of speech remain as
unconstitutional with the Commerce Department as the licensing authority as they did when the
State Department made licensing decisions.<BR>
 <BR>
The ACLU urges that the cryptography export licensing rules be rescinded. Modification of the
scheme is not sufficient to remove the First Amendment infringements. Encryption is speech, and
as such is entitled to protection. The licensing regulations are unconstitutional, and need to be
removed.<BR>

          With the exception of the proceedings in the district
court, this case has not been before this or any other court. 
Legal issues similar to the issues raised in this appeal have been
raised in a case pending before Judge Patel in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California, <U>Bernstein</U>
v. <U>Department of State</U>, C 95-00582 MHP, and in another case
pending before Judge Nugent in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Ohio, <U>Junger</U> v. <U>Christopher</U>, Case No.
96 CV 1723. <BR>
<B>INTERESTS OF THE <I>AMICI CURIAE</I><BR>
</B><BR>
          The Electronic Privacy Information Center ("EPIC") is a
non-profit, public interest research center in Washington, D.C.,
that was established in 1994 to focus public attention on emerging
civil liberties issues in the field of electronic information. 
EPIC is sponsored by the Fund for Constitutional Government, a
non-profit organization established in 1974 to protect privacy,
the First Amendment, and other constitutional rights.<P>
            EPIC monitors and disseminates information about court
decisions and government policies that affect electronic privacy. 
EPIC has developed an expertise in the legal issues in this area,
as well as a technical expertise in encryption that helps to
illuminate the practical aspects of the issues currently before
the Court.  EPIC is concerned that the district court's ruling, if
allowed to stand, would unnecessarily restrain the development of
encryption techniques, an emerging communications technology that
already has proven essential to the global communications network.<P>
          The American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, National
Headquarters ("ACLU"), is a nationwide, nonpartisan organization
of nearly 300,000 members dedicated to defending the principles of
liberty and equality embodied in the Bill of Rights.  Throughout
its 75 year history, the ACLU has been particularly concerned with
any abridgement of the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment. 
The ACLU has worked to ensure that First Amendment protections are
extended to each new communications technology -- the telephone,
radio, television, cable, and now online communications.  The ACLU
has, therefore, appeared before the Supreme Court and the Courts
of Appeals in numerous cases involving the First Amendment, both
as direct counsel and as <I>amicus curiae</I>.  The ACLU is concerned
that the district court's ruling, if allowed to stand, would set a
harmful precedent that could allow government to infringe too
easily on the speech rights of those using electronic media.<P>
     The Internet Society (ISOC) is a non-governmental
international organization for worldwide coordination and
collaboration of Internet standards, issues and education for the
Internet and its internetworking technologies and applications. 
The Internet Society has over 7,500 members, currently
representing 108 countries of the world and comprised of
commercial companies, governmental agencies, foundations, and
individuals.  ISOC serves to assure the beneficial, open evolution
of the global Internet and its related internetworking

<P>
<U><B>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</B></U><P>
          Appellant Philip R. Karn brings this appeal to challenge
the constitutionality of the Arms Export Control Act ("AECA" or
"Act"), 22 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2751-2796d (1994), and the regulations that
implement it, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
("ITAR" or "Regulations"), 22 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 120-130 (1996).<P>
          Under AECA, the President is authorized, <U>inter</U> <U>alia</U>, to
control the import and export of "defense articles" and "defense
services," 22 U.S.C. &#167; 2778(a)(1), by placing such items on the
"United States Munitions List."  22 C.F.R. &#167; 121.1.  The category
of the United States Munitions List at issue in this case includes
software containing cryptographic algorithms.  <U>See</U> 22 C.F.R. &#167;
121.1(XIII)(b)(1).  <P>
     To determine whether the United States Munitions List
includes a particular item (and thus whether the item is subject
to restrictions on its dissemination), an individual is required
to file a written "Commodity Jurisdiction Request" with the Office
of Defense Trade Controls ("ODTC").  <U>See</U> 22 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 120.4,
120.4(d) (setting forth factors considered by ODTC in making its
licensing determination).  The ODTC's decisions regarding the
United States Munitions List are not subject to judicial review. 
<U>See</U> 22 U.S.C. &#167; 2778(h) ("The designation by the President (or by
an official to whom the President's functions . . . have been duly
delegated) in regulations issued under this section of items as
defense articles or defense services for purposes of this section
shall not be subject to judicial review.").  If an item is on the
United States Munitions List, an individual must secure a license
from the ODTC before publishing or disseminating the item.  <U>See</U> 22
C.F.R. &#167; 123.1.  Failure to secure the requisite license subjects
the item being published or disseminated to seizure and the
publisher to criminal liability.  <U>See</U> 22 C.F.R. &#167; 127.6.  <P>
In order to further dialogue among mathematicians and computer
scientists concerning cryptography and to fulfill his interest in
the dissemination of information about cryptography, Appellant
Karn, a software engineer involved in developing cryptographic
computer programs, sought to publish and disseminate text written
in C programming language that embodied cryptographic algorithms
and was stored on a computer diskette.  In accordance with the
Regulations, on March 9, 1994, Karn submitted a Commodity
Jurisdiction Request for a determination of whether this text was
subject to export licensing requirements.  Sixty-three days later,
on May 11, 1994, the Office of Defense Trade Controls ruled that
the source code constituted a "defense article" under Category
XIII(b)(1) of the United States Munitions List and was therefore
subject to export licensing requirements.  Karn unsuccessfully
appealed the ODTC's determination to the Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for Export Controls, and then to the Assistant
Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs.  Having
exhausted his administrative remedies, Karn brought this suit
against the Department of State and the Assistant Secretary,
Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, to secure a declaratory
judgment holding, <U>inter</U> <U>alia</U>, that the licensing determination
provisions of the Regulations violate the First Amendment.  The
district court granted Defendants' motions to dismiss and for
summary judgment, <U>Karn</U> v. <U>United States Dep't of State</U>, 925 F.
Supp. 8 (D.D.C. 1996), and this appeal followed.<U><BR>
</U><BR>
<U><B>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT</B></U><P>
The Arms Export Control Act and its implementing Regulations
impose an unconstitutional prior restraint on text written in a
programming language -- which is protected expression under the
First Amendment.  Because the Act and Regulations require
individuals to submit textual materials to prepublication
governmental review, the Regulations vest undue discretion in the
government licensor, and the prior restraint effected does not
fall within the extremely narrow exception to the First
Amendment's ban on prior restraints, the Act must be found
unconstitutional.  Furthermore, because the licensing scheme
embodied in the Act does not provide the procedural safeguards
necessary to render prior restraints constitutional, the Act
violates the First Amendment.  The Act is an impermissible
regulation aimed at the suppression of expression and fails strict
scrutiny.  The judgment of the district court should therefore be
reversed.  <P>
<U><B>STATEMENT ON CRYPTOGRAPHY</B></U><P>
 I.<U>Cryptography and the protections to privacy interests it
provides are vital components of emerging global
communications technologies.</U><P>
<BR>
Emerging computer and communications technologies are  radically
altering the ways in which we communicate and exchange 
information.  Along with the speed, efficiency, and cost-saving 
benefits of the "digital revolution" come new challenges to the 
security and privacy of communications and information traversing
the global communications infrastructure.  As one commentator has
observed, "the ease with which electronic mail messages can be
intercepted by third parties means that communicating by public
electronic mail systems, like the Internet, is becoming almost as
insecure as talking in a crowded restaurant."  A. Michael
Froomkin, <U>The Metaphor is the Key: Cryptography, the Clipper Chip,
and the Constitution</U>, 143 U. Pa. L. Rev. 709, 724 (1995) (footnote
omitted).  As the National Research Council's Committee to Study
Cryptography Policy ("NRC Committee") recently noted, the threat
to personal privacy is substantial:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>     Increasing reliance on electronic commerce and the use
     of networked communication for all manner of activities 
     suggest that more information about more people will be 
     stored in network-accessible systems and will be
     communicated more broadly and more often, thus raising
     questions about the security of that information.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>National Research Council, <U>Cryptography's Role in Securing the 
Information Society</U>, &#167; 1.5 (May 30, 1996) [hereinafter <U>NRC
Report</U>].  Likewise, in a 1993 report to Congress, the General 
Accounting Office warned that "[t]he increased use of computer and
communications systems by industry has increased the risk of theft
of proprietary information."  GAO, <U>Communications Privacy-
- Federal Policy and Actions</U>, No. GAO/OSI-94-2, app. Sec. I:1
(1993).<P>
In response to these challenges, the security mechanisms of
traditional paper-based communications media -- envelopes and
locked filing cabinets -- are being replaced by cryptographic
security techniques.  Through the use of cryptography,
communication and information stored and transmitted by computers
can be protected against interception to a very high degree.  <U>See</U>,
<U>e.g.</U>, <U>id.</U> ("[E]ncryption is a primary method of protecting
valuable electronic information").  Until recently, there was
little demand for encryption capabilities outside of the
government.  Modern encryption technology -- a mathematical
process involving the use of formulas (or algorithms) -- was
traditionally deployed most widely to protect the confidentiality
of military and diplomatic communications.  With the advent of the
computer revolution, and recent innovations in the science of
encryption, a new market for cryptographic products has developed. 
Electronic communications  are now widely used in the civilian
sector and have become an integral component of the global
economy.  Computers store and exchange an ever-increasing amount
of highly personal information, including medical and financial
data.  In this electronic environment, the need for
privacy-enhancing technologies is apparent.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, David
Chaum, <U>Achieving Electronic Privacy</U>, Scientific American, Aug.
1992, at 96.  <P>
Communications applications such as electronic mail and electronic
fund transfers require secure means of encryption and
authentication -- features that can only be provided if
cryptographic know-how is widely available and unencumbered by
government regulation.<P>
          Although the technical details of cryptographic systems are
quite complex, the underlying concepts can be easily grasped. 
Cryptography provides a means of accomplishing two crucial
functions -- encryption and authentication.  Encryption is the
process of encoding or "scrambling" the contents of any data or
voice communication with an algorithm (a mathematical formula) and
a randomly selected variable associated with the algorithm, known
as a "key."  Only the intended recipient of the communication, who
holds the key, can decrypt and access the information.  The key is
a string of numbers; the longer the string, the stronger the
security.  For example, the standard bank ATM personal
identification number of four numbers would be more difficult to
guess if it contained eight numbers.  Each number that is added to
a key dramatically increases the possible combinations.  As such,
more computing time and power are required to break the security
of the encoded information.<P>
The authentication capabilities of cryptographic systems involve
the use of "digital signatures."  A digital signature is a
cryptographically-based assurance that a particular file or
message was created or transmitted by a given person.  <U>See</U>
<U>generally</U> ABA Science & Technology Section, <U>Digital Signature
Guidelines</U> (1996).  It thus provides a means of authenticating the
integrity of electronically transmitted data and the identity of
the sender, much as a handwritten signature verifies the
authenticity of a paper record.  Digital signatures also provide
for the "non-repudiation" of electronic data -- the inability to
deny the authenticity of the transmitted information.  As we move
toward increased reliance on electronic communications -- and the
electronic filing of court pleadings -- the importance of such
capabilities is apparent. <P>
     A.<U>Cryptography is a prerequisite for electronic commerce;
export controls impede its development both domestically
and globally.</U><P>
<BR>
Cryptographic technology is an essential component of the secure
communications infrastructure required for meaningful electronic
commerce and continued economic development.  As CommerceNet, a
consortium of firms encouraging the development and use of
electronic commerce over the Internet, noted in a recent report,
"U.S. companies, competing internationally, must be able to
provide strong encryption in environments such as electronic
commerce where security concerns are paramount." CommerceNet
Network Services Working Group, <U>Toward Enabling Secure Electronic
Commerce: The Need for a Revised U.S. Cryptographic Policy</U> 1 (June
26, 1995) [hereinafter <U>Cryptographic Policy</U>] (article available
through CommerceNet).  The consortium concluded that<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>[u]nless [Internet] security problems are fixed, companies   
whose survival may depend on proprietary trade secrets and   
closely guarded cost and price information, and financial    
institutions required to provide a payments infrastructure,  
will not participate [in electronic commerce].  Without the  
support of financial institutions, it will not be possible   
to gather the critical density of businesses necessary for   
a healthy marketplace to develop.
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<U>Cryptographic Policy</U>, <U>supra</U> at 3.  Likewise, the Internet
Architecture Board ("IAB") and the Internet Engineering Steering
Group ("IESG"), the bodies which oversee architecture and
standards for the Internet, recently observed that:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[a]s more and more companies connect to the Internet, and as
more and more commerce takes place there, security is
becoming more and more critical.  Cryptography is the most   
powerful single tool that users can use to secure the
Internet. Knowingly making that tool weaker threatens their  
ability to do so, and has no proven benefit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<U>IAB and IESG Statement on Cryptographic Technology and the
Internet</U> 4 (July 24, 1996) ("<U>IAB and IESG Statement</U>") (available
on the Internet at ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1984.txt).<P>
Governmental restrictions on the export of encryption software --
and the draconian manner in which they are applied -- impede the
development of the secure global infrastructure that electronic
commerce requires.  Less apparent is the effect of these
restrictions on the domestic development and use of
privacy-enhancing cryptographic technologies, to the detriment of
individual rights and commercial concerns within the United
States.  This domestic impact occurs as a result of the global
nature of computer technology and networked communications.  A
global communications infrastructure requires "interoperability"
-- the ability of a user in the United States to communicate with
a European user through systems that employ common technological
standards.  In the context of encryption technology, this requires
information to be encrypted and/or authenticated using the same
cryptographic system.  As long as a user outside of the United
States cannot decrypt a message encrypted by a system that may
legally be sold only in the United States, the functionality of
that system -- and its marketability -- is substantially limited.<P>
          The problem of interoperability, coupled with U.S. export
restrictions on encryption software, has led U.S. software
manufacturers to produce relatively weak security products that 
can be sold both at home and abroad.  This is particularly true of
"integrated" products, such as word processing and spreadsheet
programs that contain cryptographic capabilities.  As the NRC 
Committee found,<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>     U.S. export controls have had a negative impact on the 
     cryptographic strength of many integrated products with 
     encryption capabilities available in the United States.  
     Export controls tend to drive major vendors to a "least 
     common denominator" cryptographic solution that will pass 
     export review as well as sell in the United States.  . . . 
     [E]xport controls have had some impact on the availability 
     of cryptographic authentication capabilities around the 
     world.  Export controls distort the global market for 
     cryptography, and the product decisions of vendors that 
     might be made in one way in the absence of export controls 
     may well be made another way in their presence.
</BLOCKQUOTE><U>NRC Report</U>, <U>supra</U>, &#167; 4.3.1 (footnote omitted).<P>
<BR>
For a quarter of a century, the United States has led the world in
the development of computer and communications 
technology.  That leadership position is being threatened,
however, by the anachronistic controls on cryptography at issue in
this case.  As noted, a global communications infrastructure has
emerged (largely as a result of U.S. innovation), requiring
sophisticated techniques for the security and privacy of
communications.  Individuals will increasingly demand that their
personal privacy be preserved in the new information environment,
and commercial entities will require the highest level of
protection for valuable financial and proprietary data.  In short,
future leadership in the field of information technology will
depend upon leadership in the field of information security. The
demand for security must be met, if not by U.S. engineers and
software developers, then by others.  In its 1993 report, the
General Accounting Office described such a scenario:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An example of a product type for which export controls affect
U.S. global competitiveness is software with encryption
capabilities used in international commercial networks.  As
an example of less stringent foreign controls, a German
company contracts with a Japanese company to manufacture a
high-speed encryption chip for export to Germany.  In
contrast, U.S. export controls prevent U.S. companies from
exporting such a chip to the German company.
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
GAO, <U>supra</U>, pt. 5.<P>
<BR>
Although controls on the export of encryption software are
maintained in the name of national security, "[t]he development of
foreign competitors in the information technology industry could
have a number of disadvantageous consequences from the standpoint
of U.S. national security interests."  <U>NRC Report</U>, <U>supra</U>, &#167; 4.4.2.<P>
<P>
The export restrictions on encryption software at issue in this
case have had, and will continue to have, a substantial 
detrimental effect on the U.S. computer and communications 
industries.  Because these export restrictions require U.S. 
software manufacturers to market only products with weak and 
insufficient security features, the restrictions hobble U.S. 
software manufacturers and severely endanger their future world 
leadership.  Counterintuitively, the export restrictions also 
endanger U.S. national security interests by allowing foreign 
encryption technology to flourish, while stunting the development
of U.S. encryption technology.
<DL>
<DD>B.<U>Restrictions on the dissemination of cryptographic
information infringe upon individual privacy rights.</U></DL>
<BR>
     Governmental regulation of the free flow of information 
concerning cryptographic security techniques endangers personal
privacy as well as commerce.  These two aspects of cryptographic 
regulation were cited in the recent IAB and IESG Statement, <U>supra</U>,
which noted that the oversight bodies "are concerned by the need
for increased protection of international commercial transactions
on the Internet, and by the need to offer all Internet users an
adequate degree of privacy."  IAB and IESG Statement, <U>supra</U>, at 1.
Indeed, cryptographic technology is becoming an increasingly vital
tool for human rights activists, political dissidents, and
whistle-blowers throughout the world to facilitate confidential
communications free from intrusion.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, 1 David Banisar, <U>A
Primer on Electronic Surveillance for Human Rights Organizations</U>,
International Privacy Bulletin 3 (July 1993).  <P>

The fundamental right to communications privacy has been
recognized by the Supreme Court in several landmark cases.  Thus,
for example, the Court held in <U>Katz</U> v. <U>United States</U>, 389 U.S.
347, 353 (1967), that "[t]he Government's activities in
electronically listening to and recording the petitioner's words
violated the privacy upon which he justifiably relied."  <U>See</U> <U>also</U>
<U>United States</U> v. <U>United States District Court</U>, 407 U.S. 297, 321
(1972) (recognizing importance of requirement that government
obtain judicial warrant before conducting domestic security
wiretap, and noting warrant requirement's reassuring effect on
public).  In today's electronic communications infrastructure,
cryptography protects the individual privacy interest repeatedly
recognized by the Court -- the privacy of one's communications. 
Cryptography may, in fact, provide the only effective defense
against "indiscriminate wiretapping" in the emerging global
network.  <U>Id</U>.
<P>
Cryptographic techniques can also provide confidentiality of
personal records, such as medical information, personal financial
data, and electronic mail.  In a networked environment, such
information is increasingly at risk of theft or misuse.  Indeed,
almost twenty years ago the Supreme Court recognized the risks to
personal privacy created by unwarranted disclosures of information
maintained by the government itself:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are not unaware of the threat to privacy implicit in the
accumulation of vast amounts of personal information in
computerized data banks or other massive government files . .
. . much of which is personal in character and potentially
embarrassing or harmful if disclosed.  
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<U>Whalen</U> v. <U>Roe</U>, 429 U.S. 589, 605 (1977) (footnote omitted).  These
risks have increased substantially as virtually all vital records,
both public and private, are now maintained electronically.<P>
The privacy interests facilitated by cryptography are recognized
internationally, as well as in the United States.  Fifteen
international human rights and civil liberties organizations,
including <I>amici</I> EPIC and ACLU, recently endorsed a "Resolution in
Support of the Freedom to Use Cryptography."  The resolution notes
that "the use of cryptography implicates human rights and matters
of personal liberty that affect individuals around the world," and
that "the privacy of communication is explicitly protected by
Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article
17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
and national law."  <U>See</U> <U>Resolution in Support of the Freedom to
Use Cryptography</U>, Sept. 25, 1996 (available on the Internet at
<A HREF="http://www.gilc.org/gilc/">http://www.gilc.org/gilc/</A>
resolution.html).<P>
In sum, the governmental regulations at issue not only hobble the
development of electronic commerce, but jeopardize personal
privacy interests as well.

I.<U>The text at issue is protected expression under the First
Amendment.</U><P>
In an effort to communicate his ideas regarding encryption,
Appellant Karn sought a governmental determination that text
written in C programming language embodying cryptographic
algorithms stored on a computer diskette was not subject to the
export licensing jurisdiction of the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations, which request was refused.  Although it erred in that
it applied the wrong First Amendment standard, the district court
correctly determined that "[a]s a threshold matter . . . the
protection of the First Amendment extends to the source code and
the comments on the plaintiff's diskette," <U>Karn</U>, 925 F.Supp. at 9,
and that First Amendment protection is "provided for the
communication of scientific or mathematical information" as
conveyed via the source code and comments at issue, <U>id.</U> at 9 n.20;
<U>see</U> <U>also</U> <U>Bernstein</U> v. <U>U.S. Dep't of State</U>, 922 F. Supp. 1426, 1439
(N.D. Cal. 1996) (expressly holding that source code is speech for
purposes of the First Amendment); <U>United States</U> v. <U>Mendelsohn</U>, 896
F.2d 1183, 1186 (9th Cir. 1990) (recognizing that computer
programs may warrant First Amendment protection).  This court
should uphold that determination.

<P>
Source code, such as that stored on the diskette at issue, is
essentially text written in a "high-level" language, <U>i.e.</U>, a form
of language closer syntactically and semantically to natural
languages like English or Spanish than to the "low-level"
languages that actually direct the functioning of a computer.  <U>See</U>

Information Processing</U> 1-32 (1980).  An important function of
source code, and of English-language "comments" embedded in source

While <U>object</U> code is designed specifically to be read and

explained:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Just as a mathematics text or written music communicates
to a specially trained group of readers, a computer
program communicates to its own group of readers.  When
seen in this light, the First Amendment implications of
computer programs are no different from those of many
other copyrightable texts.

Source code written in a high-level programming language such as C

The series of C programming language statements set forth above

at issue in the instant case expresses ideas in a structured form
to a specialized audience.  This communication of ideas, whether
emanating from an 18th Century printing press or from a 20th
Century source code editor, warrants the protection of the First
Amendment.  <P>
Copyright law also supports, by analogy, the extension of the
First Amendment to encompass source code.  <U>See</U> <U>Bernstein</U>, 922 F.
Supp. at 1436.  The copyright statute contemplates that authors
will use computer programs as a vehicle for expressing their
ideas, and the protection of copyright law in fact extends to the
expression of ideas embodied in computer programs.  <U>See</U> H.R. Rep.
No. 94-1476 at 54 (1976), <U>reprinted</U> <U>in</U> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659,
5667; <U>see</U> <U>also</U> 17 U.S.C. &#167; 101, at 878 (1994) (granting copyright
protection to works "expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal
or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the
material objects, such as books, . . . tapes, disks, or cards, in
which they are embodied"); 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a)(1) (1994); <U>Apple
Computer, Inc.</U> v. <U>Franklin Computer Corp.</U>, 714 F.2d 1240, 1249 (3d
Cir. 1983) (extending copyright protection to source code as a
"literary work"), <U>cert.</U> <U>dismissed</U>, 464 U.S. 1033 (1984). 
Furthermore, the Supreme Court has explained that the Copyright
Act's protection of the expression of ideas embodies the core
values of the First Amendment.  <U>See</U> <U>Harper & Row Publishers, Inc.</U>
v. <U>Nation Enter.</U>, 471 U.S. 539 (1985); <U>see</U> <U>also</U> Note, <U>Clarifying
the Copyright Misuse Defense: The Role of Antitrust Standards and
First Amendment Values</U>, 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1289 (1991) (the
fundamental goal of copyright law -- to foster the creation and
the dissemination of ideas and information -- is rooted in the
First Amendment); <U>United States</U> v. <U>LaMacchia</U>, 871 F. Supp. 535,
537 (D. Mass. 1994) (noting, in case involving copyrighted
computer software, that objective of copyright law is to promote
First Amendment concern for the free dissemination of ideas). 
Because copyright law protects expression, including text written
in a programming language, the First Amendment protection of
expression naturally extends to encompass text written in
programming languages as well.<P>

 For the reasons stated above, this Court should conclude that the
district court was correct in its threshold determination that
"the protection of the First Amendment extends to the source code
and the comments on the plaintiff's diskette," <U>Karn</U>, 925 F. Supp.
at 9, and that First Amendment protection is "provided for the
communication of scientific or mathematical information" as
conveyed via plaintiff's source code and comments, <U>id.</U> at 9 n.20.<BR>

<DD>A.<U>The Act and Regulations as applied to expression

     </DL>
<BR>
Because the Arms Export Control Act and its implementing
Regulations require an individual to secure a government-issued
license before the publication or dissemination of protected
expression, they embody a classic form of prior restraint on
expression.  <U>See</U> <U>Bernstein</U>, 922 F. Supp. at 1438 (on defendant's
motion to dismiss for lack of justiciability, court finds
colorable plaintiff's claim that the Arms Export Control Act
effects an unconstitutional prior restraint on protected
expression, <U>viz</U>., source code with cryptographic content).  The
Supreme Court has repeatedly held that <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[a statute which] makes the peaceful enjoyment of freedoms
which the Constitution guarantees contingent upon the
uncontrolled will of an official -- as by requiring a permit
or license which may be granted or withheld in the discretion
of such official -- is an unconstitutional censorship or
prior restraint upon the enjoyment of those freedoms. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<U>Shuttlesworth</U> v. <U>Birmingham</U>, 394 U.S. 147, 150-51 (1969).  As the
Supreme Court explained early in this century, "it has been
generally, if not universally, considered that it is the chief
purpose of the guarantee [of freedom of expression] to prevent
previous restraints upon publication," as prior restraints are
"the essence of censorship."  <U>Near</U> v. <U>Minnesota</U>, 283 U.S. 697, 713
(1931); <U>see</U> <U>also</U> <U>id.</U> at 713-15 (describing our Nation's centuries
old history of repugnance toward prior restraints).  Accordingly,
"[a]ny system of prior restraints of expression comes to [the]
Court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional
validity." <U>Bantam Books, Inc.</U> v. <U>Sullivan</U>, 372 U.S. 58, 70 (1963);
<U>New York Times Co.</U> v. <U>United States</U>, 403 U.S. 713, 714 (1971) (per
curiam). <P>
The circumstances of this case present precisely the type of
"grave dangers of a censorship system" that the Supreme Court has
repeatedly condemned in its discussion of prior restraints.  <U>See</U>
<U>FW/PBS, Inc.</U> v. <U>Dallas</U>, 493 U.S. 215, 228 (1990).  The
government's interest in this case rests clearly and explicitly on
the desire to suppress expression that it deems undesirable.  The
Act and Regulations embody an outright <U>prohibition</U> on the
dissemination of expression that the government considers harmful
-- not a mere regulation of that expression.  <U>Cf.</U> <U>Cox</U> v. <U>New
Hampshire</U>, 312 U.S. 569 (1941) (parade permit licensing scheme
found constitutional where licensing official was not allowed to
suppress expression and licensing scheme merely facilitated
regulation of street usage to assure police protection and avoid
overlapping parades).  Furthermore, the instant case does not
involve a licensing scheme intended to distinguish between
protected and unprotected expression, which might call for the
application of a less stringent constitutional standard.  <U>See</U>
<U>Near</U>, 283 U.S. at 714-16 (describing separate treatment, for
purposes of prior restraint analysis, of statutes whose purpose is
to distinguish between speech that is protected by the First
Amendment and speech that is outside First Amendment protection,
such as obscene publications or fighting words). <P>
In any case involving a prior restraint on protected expression,
such as that embodied in the Act and Regulations, the government
"carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the
imposition of such a restraint."  <U>New York Times</U>, 403 U.S. at 714. 
The First Amendment's ban on prior restraints may be overridden
only where the government conclusively establishes that the
regulation falls within the one recognized exception to the ban on
prior restraints applicable in cases involving national security
concerns.  This exception to the rule against prior restraints has
been construed very narrowly:  it is met only where "[publication]
will surely result in direct, immediate, and irreparable damage to
our Nation or its people," <U>id.</U> at 730 (Stewart, J., joined by
White, J., concurring), or where there is "governmental allegation
and proof that publication must inevitably, directly, and
immediately cause the occurrence of an event kindred to imperiling
the safety of a transport already at sea," <U>id.</U> at 726-27 (Brennan,
J., concurring); <U>see</U> <U>also</U> <U>Near</U>, 283 U.S. at 716.  <P>
This extremely narrow exception to the prohibition on prior
restraints "refers to the fact that, as a matter of procedural
safeguards and burden of proof, prior restraints even within a
recognized exception to the rule against prior restraints will be
extremely difficult to justify."  <U>See</U> <U>Nebraska Press Ass'n</U> v.
<U>Stuart</U>, 427 U.S. 539, 592 (1976) (Brennan, J., joined by Stewart,
J., and Marshall, J., concurring).  Within the sole possible
exception to the prohibition against prior restraints, therefore,
the government's burden is "formidable," and indeed "almost
insuperable."  <U>Id</U>. at 593-94.  Thus, for example, even in the face
of the government's assertion that the publication of a classified
Defense Department study would interfere with national security,
produce the death of military personnel, and prolong the Vietnam
War, the Supreme Court refused to uphold a prior restraint imposed
on publication, holding that the government failed to meet its
"'heavy burden of showing justification for the imposition of such
a [prior] restraint.'" <U>New York Times</U>, 403 U.S. at 714 (Brennan,
J., concurring).<P>
In the instant case, the government does not even contend that the
publication or dissemination of the text at issue will cause
"direct, immediate, and irreparable damage to the Nation or its
people."  <U>Id.</U> at 730 (Stewart, J., joined by White, J.,
concurring).  Under the Regulations, the government may ban the
dissemination of source code if it determines that the source code
text is designed or adaptable "for a military application, and has
significant military or intelligence applicability such that
control under this [Regulation] is necessary."  <U>See</U> 22 C.F.R. &#167;
120.3(b); <U>see</U> <U>also</U> <U>id.</U> &#167; 120.4(d) (describing variety of factors
to be weighed by licensor).  Notably, the government has weighed
these factors and determined that even an academic paper setting
forth a professor's scientific research in the area of
cryptography was subject to restriction on its publication.  <U>See</U>
<U>Bernstein</U>, 922 F. Supp. at 1434.  This sort of discretionary,
standardless prepublication review of protected expression
embodied in the Regulations fails to satisfy the standard set
forth in <U>New York Times</U> and poses the grave dangers of a
censorship system that the Supreme Court has repeatedly condemned. 
<U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, <U>Niemotko</U> v. <U>Maryland</U>, 340 U.S. 268 (1951).       <P>
With one exception -- which is readily distinguishable from the
instant case -- <I>amici</I> are aware of no Supreme Court case that has
ever upheld a government licensing system, such as the one
embodied in the Act and Regulations, that requires authors to
submit their texts to a prepublication governmental review and
permit process.  In <U>Snepp</U> v. <U>United States</U>, 444 U.S. 507 (1980)
(per curiam), the Supreme Court upheld an order requiring a former
CIA agent to submit his CIA-related writings to prepublication
review by the Agency.  However, the Court expressly rested its
decision on the fact that the former CIA agent had, as an express
condition of his employment with the CIA, executed an agreement
promising that he would not publish any information relating to
the CIA either during or after the term of his employment without
specific prior approval of the Agency.  Because no such
governmental employment relationship or agreement is involved in
this case, <U>Snepp</U>'s countenance of a prepublication license scheme
is readily distinguishable.<P>
Because the Act and Regulations embody a paradigm form of prior
restraint on protected expression in which undue discretion is
vested in the government licensor, <U>see</U> <U>Shuttlesworth</U>, 394 U.S.
147; <U>Niemotko</U>, 340 U.S. 268, and which does not comply with the
standard of <U>New York Times</U>, the Act's licensing scheme must be
found unconstitutional.<BR>
<DL>
<DD>B.<U>The prior restraint embodied in the Act and Regulations
is also unconstitutional because it fails to provide
necessary procedural safeguards.</U></DL>
<P>
The Act and Regulations embody a prior restraint that is
unconstitutional for a second, independent reason:  here, as in
<U>FW/PBS</U>, the statutory scheme lacks the fundamental procedural
safeguards that the Supreme Court has repeatedly identified as
essential to a government licensing scheme -- even one designed to
separate protected from unprotected speech.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, <U>Freedman</U>
v. <U>Maryland</U>, 380 U.S. 51 (1965).<P>
To pass constitutional muster, even an otherwise valid prior
restraint on protected expression must provide at least the
following two procedural safeguards:<BR>
<DL>
<DL>
<DD>- Definite and reasonable limitations on the time within
which the licensor must decide whether to issue the
license; and<P>
<DD>- Expeditious judicial review of the licensing decision
must be available.</DL>
</DL>
<BR>
  <U><BR>
See</U> <U>Freedman</U>, 380 U.S. at 58-59; <U>Bantam Books</U>, 372 U.S. at 70;
<U>FW/PBS</U>, 493 U.S. at 227-230.<P>
The First Amendment guarantee of freedom of expression is abridged
whenever the government conditions the enjoyment of protected
expression upon prior permission from the government without
adequate procedural safeguards on the permit process.  <U>See</U> <U>FW/PBS</U>,
493 U.S. at 223-27.  Notably, even otherwise <U>valid</U> restrictions on
speech that constitute prior restraints are unconstitutional if
they fail to provide the <U>Freedman</U> procedural safeguards.  <U>See</U>
<U>11126 Baltimore Boulevard, Inc.</U> v. <U>Prince George's County, Md.</U>, 58
F.3d 988, 995 (4th Cir.), <U>cert.</U> <U>denied</U>, 116 S. Ct. 567 (1995).<P>
The Act and Regulations fail to provide the required procedural
safeguards for prior restraints, first, because they fail to
impose time limits on the government's commodity jurisdiction or
export licensing determinations.  "A prior restraint on speech
that imposes no time limitations on the decision-making process
plainly fails to satisfy the first requirement set forth in
<U>Freedman</U>."  <U>Baltimore Boulevard</U>, 58 F.3d at 997; <U>see</U> <U>also</U> <U>FW/PBS</U>,
493 U.S. at 227.  Although the reasonableness of the time period
of the licensor's decision-making process may vary in different
contexts depending on the type of judgments involved in the
licensing determination, an open-ended time frame such as that
permitted under the Regulations clearly lacks this requisite
procedural safeguard.  <U>See</U> <U>United States v. Thirty-Seven
Photographs</U>, 402 U.S. 363, 374 (1971); <U>Baltimore Boulevard</U>, 58
F.3d at 997; <U>see</U> <U>also</U> <U>Teitel Film Corp. v. Cusack</U>, 390 U.S. 139,
141-142 (1968) (per curiam) (finding that 50-57 day period for
obtaining an administrative decision in film censorship context
did not amount to a "specified brief period" for purposes of the
<U>Freedman</U> analysis).  Indeed, the 63-day period for obtaining an
administrative decision in the instant case demonstrates that the
Act and Regulations fail to provide this necessary procedural
safeguard. <P>
Second, the Act and Regulations fail to provide for prompt
judicial review of the government's licensing decision.  The
Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of the
availability of expeditious judicial review of licensing
determinations in the prior restraint context.  <U>See</U> <U>Freedman</U>, 380
U.S. at 58-59; <U>Thirty-Seven Photographs</U>, 402 U.S. at 368; <U>see</U> <U>also</U>
<U>United States</U> v. <U>Pryba</U>, 502 F.2d 391, 405 (D.C. Cir. 1974)
("[B]ecause only a judicial determination in an adversary
proceeding ensures the necessary sensitivity to freedom of
expression, only a procedure requiring a judicial determination
suffices to impose a valid final [prior] restraint.").  <I>Amici</I> are
aware of no case in which a federal court has upheld a regulation
imposing a prior restraint on protected expression where judicial
review of the licensor's decision was expressly unavailable, as
the government contends is the case under the Act and the
Regulations, and as the lower court so held.  <U>See</U> <U>Baltimore
Boulevard</U>, 58 F.3d at 1000-01 (collecting cases).  <P>
Even assuming the licensing decision required under the Act was
judicially reviewable -- contrary to the district court's
conclusion -- the 127-day time period between the date judicial
review was sought and the date a final decision was rendered in
this case would not constitute "prompt judicial review."  <U>Compare</U>
<U>Thirty-Seven Photographs</U>, 402 U.S. at 372-73 (holding that delays
in judicial determination as long as three months cannot be
sanctioned) <U>and</U> <U>East Brooks Books, Inc.</U> v. <U>City of Memphis</U>, 48
F.3d 220, 225 (6th Cir.) (holding that potential delay of over
five months before judicial hearing is impermissible), <U>cert.</U>
<U>denied</U>, 116 S. Ct. 277 (1995) <U>and</U> <U>Baltimore Boulevard</U>, 58 F.3d at
1001 (holding that delay of 103 days prior to obtaining judicial
ruling on licensing decision is impermissible) <U>with</U> <U>Interstate
Circuit, Inc.</U> v. <U>City of Dallas</U>, 390 U.S. 676, 690 n.22 (1968)
(holding that prompt judicial review was assured by provision
requiring judicial determination within nine days of
administrative decision) <U>and</U> <U>Thirty-Seven Photographs</U>, 402 U.S. at
372-74 (construing statute to require a judicial decision within
60 days to uphold constitutionality of statutorily imposed prior
restraint).  Furthermore, if the government and the lower court
are correct in their conclusion that judicial review of the
government's licensing determination is <U>expressly</U> <U>prohibited</U> under
the Act, <U>see</U> <U>Karn</U>, 925 F. Supp. at 6, then the Act would clearly
embody a prior restraint wholly deficient as regards the "prompt
judicial review" procedural safeguard.<P>
In sum, the Act and the Regulations impose a prior restraint on
protected expression that does not satisfy the requirements of <U>New
York Times</U> and vests undue discretion with the government
licensing official.  Even if the Act embodied an otherwise valid
licensing scheme, it is unconstitutional because it fails to
provide definite and reasonable limitations on the time within
which the government must issue its licensing determinations and
fails to provide for -- indeed, as the government and the lower
court contend, expressly prohibits -- prompt judicial review of
licensing determinations.  Thus, the Act and the Regulations
constitute a system of unconstitutional prior restraint of
protected expression in violation of the First Amendment.  <BR>
III.<U>The Act is squarely aimed at the suppression of expression
and fails strict scrutiny.</U><P>
Under the Act and Regulations, the government seeks to restrict
the dissemination of certain text because it considers such
expression to be too dangerous to export.  Thus, even if not
analyzed as a prior restraint, the licensing scheme is
constitutionally suspect because it is squarely aimed at the
suppression of allegedly dangerous or harmful expression.  If the
diskette contained source code embodying word processing
applications, for example, instead of source code embodying
encryption algorithms, the government would no longer have an
interest in restricting its dissemination.  The licensing scheme
therefore embodies a content-based regulation aimed at the
suppression of expression.<P>
As discussed above, text written in a programming language
constitutes protected expression for First Amendment purposes. 
Because the Arms Export Control Act regulates expression itself --
not expressive conduct or symbolic speech --the district court
erred by applying the analysis set forth in <U>United States</U> v.
<U>O'Brien</U>, 391 U.S. 367 (1968).  Contrary to the government's
assertion, the "functional" nature of a text written in
programming language neither renders it unprotected by the First
Amendment nor reduces the level of protection granted to such
expression under the First Amendment.  Different types of
functional written expression -- such as directives, instructions,
recipes, and how-to manuals -- all qualify as protected speech
under the First Amendment.  <U>See</U> <U>Bernstein</U>, 922 F. Supp. at 1435;
<U>Progressive</U>, 467 F. Supp. 990.  The more lenient First Amendment
analysis set forth in <U>O'Brien</U> is not applicable to determine the
protection granted to <U>written or spoken language</U> -- even if such
language is functional in nature.  <U>See</U> <U>Texas</U> v. <U>Johnson</U>, 491 U.S.
at 402-04.   Furthermore, the fact that a speaker expresses
himself or herself in a language other than English does not
render such language "conduct" instead of "speech" for purposes of
First Amendment analysis.  <U>See</U> <U>Yniguez</U>, 69 F.3d at 934-36 (holding
that governmental regulation of languages other than English
implicates pure speech, not mere expressive conduct).<P>
Moreover, the fact that the text at issue is stored on a computer
diskette, instead of on paper or some other traditional medium of
expression, does not render it unprotected by the First Amendment. 
On the contrary, throughout this century the First Amendment
gradually has been extended to encompass expression via new media,
to the point where today, "[t]o an increasing degree, the more
significant interchanges of ideas [occur] in electronic media." 
<U>See</U> <U>Denver Area Educ. Telecomm. Consortium, Inc.</U> v. <U>FCC</U>, 116 S.
Ct. 2374, 2414 (1996) (Kennedy, J., joined by Ginsburg, J.,
concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting
in part).  It is undisputed that the First Amendment applies to
expression communicated via such new technologies as computer
bulletin boards, computer networks, and the Internet.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>,
<U>American Civil Liberties Union</U> v. <U>Reno</U>, 929 F. Supp. 824 (E.D. Pa.
1996);  <U>see</U> <U>also</U> <U>Symposium: Emerging Media Technology and the
First Amendment</U>, 104 Yale L.J. 1613 (1995).  Thus, notwithstanding
the fact that the text at issue is stored on a computer diskette
instead of on paper, the text nonetheless constitutes protected
expression under the First Amendment.<P>
Because the Act regulates expression based on content --<BR>
 and does not merely impose a content-neutral regulation on the
time, place, or manner of such expression -- the Act is subject to
heightened First Amendment scrutiny.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, <U>Perry Educ. Ass'n</U>
v. <U>Perry Local Educators' Ass'n</U>, 460 U.S. 37 (1983); <U>Police Dep't
of Chicago</U> v. <U>Mosley</U>, 408 U.S. 92 (1972).  As the Supreme Court
explained in <U>Mosley</U>, a government regulation that is aimed at the
suppression of expression and that delineates permissible and
impermissible expression in terms of its subject matter is
unconstitutional, absent a compelling governmental interest and
narrow tailoring of means to end:<BR>
<DL>
<DD>[A]bove all else, the First Amendment means that government
has no power to restrict expression because of its message,
its ideas, its subject matter, or its content. . . . The
essence of this forbidden censorship is content control.  Any
restriction on expressive activity because of its content
would completely undercut the profound national commitment to
the principle that debate on public issues should be
uninhibited, robust, and wide open.</DL>
<U>Id.</U> at 95-96 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Such content
based regulations of expression may be upheld only if the court is
persuaded that the regulation is necessary to serve a compelling
government interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end. 
<U>See</U> <U>Perry</U>, 460 U.S. at 45; <U>Capitol Square Review & Advisory Bd.</U> v.
<U>Pinette</U>, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 2446 (1995).  <P>
The government asserts that the restrictions it imposes on the
dissemination of source code text containing cryptographic
algorithms is premised upon national security concerns.  Once
subjected to scrutiny, however, the government's national security
rationale evaporates, for the very text at issue may be downloaded
from the Internet from almost any point in the world.  <U>See</U> First
Karn Declaration, Exh. A.  Furthermore, under the Regulations, the
exact text at issue may be published without restriction when
printed on the pages of a book.  <U>See</U> <U>supra</U> at 2-3 n.2.  The means
the government has chosen cannot achieve its asserted national
security ends so long as individuals can access the very same,
allegedly dangerous text via the Internet or by reading a book. 
Because the government's means of regulating source code with
cryptographic content is not narrowly tailored to achieve its
asserted national security purpose, the Act and Regulations fail
to withstand the strict constitutional scrutiny applicable to
content-based regulations, and they should therefore be struck
down under the First Amendment.<BR>

			Remarks of Barry Steinhardt Associate Director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
			</P>
			<P>
			Security and Freedom Through Encryption (SAFE) Forum on July 1, 1996 at Stanford University.
			</P>
			<P>
			First, let me thank Jerry Berman and his staff at CDT for organizing this important forum. I also want to salute the members of Congress and Industry representative who participated in the forum and who have supported legislative actions to ensure the rights of Americans to engage in private and secure communications using encryption.
			</P>
			<P>
			There are disadvantages to being on the last panel of the day. Virtually every argument that can be made against government restrictions on encryption technology has already been made. In truth, speakers like Phil Zimmerman, Matt Blaze, Whitfield Diffie, who have been pioneers in the development of encryption technology, are far more qualified than me to explain the very practical problems with the export controls and the various iterations of Clipper.
			</P>
			<P>
			But there is also an advantage to being last. Now that all of the facts and public policy arguements are out on the table, I can engage in the luxury of attempting to put this issue in a broader political and historical perspective.
			</P>
			<P>
			The debate over encryption policy needs to be seen as part of a larger set of issues about the power and authority government in the digital age.
			</P>
			<P>
			From a civil liberties perspective, computer mediated communications are very much adouble edged sword. On the one side, the vast and detailed information flowing across the world, in a form that can be easily stored, intercepted and correlated, poses grave threats to individual privacy and autonomy. On the other side, the technology itself offers solutions ,like encryption, which create new opportunities to protect the privacy of our communications and most initmate information.
			</P>
			<P>
			The double edge of this sword has not gone unnoticed by law enforcement and the intelligence agencies. The Clinton Administration's has been especially vigorous in efforts to expand the power of the Federal Government to snoop on private communications and data -- both by taking advantage of new technology and by seeking government control of the technologies which might thwart the new surveillance.
			</P>
			<P>
			The White House has not simply given us Clipper versions 1 through 3. The Administration pushed for sweeping expansions of FBI wiretapping authority in numerous bills, including the recently passed anti-terrorism legislation..
			</P>
			<P>
			Most prominently, In 1995, the Justice Department and the intelligence agencies persuaded Congress to pass the digital telephony legislation that -- for the first time in our history -- endorsed the radical notion that the government could require an entire industry to alter its technology so the government could continue to snoop. The digital telephony legislation is akin to requiring contractors to place listening devices in the walls of the new homes they build so the bugs could be turned on one day if the government wants to listen in. As a follow up to the legislation, the Administration is proposing to require the nation's phone companies to provide it with sufficient access to enable the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to intercept communications, i.e. wiretap, 1 out of every 100 telephone lines in the nation's largest cities and other, undefined prime target areas.
			</P>
			<P>
			This is a capacity that is believed to be greater than anything the KGB ever commanded in the Soviet Union.
			</P>
			<P>
			To date, the Congress has wisely resisted the Administration's request for $500 million dollars to fund this program.
			</P>
			<P>
			All of this legislative activity has taken place against a backdrop of increased use of existing surveillance powers. The Clinton administration set a record for most crime related wiretaps in a year and , for the most wiretaps placed for intelligence purposes.The latter does not even require the same probable cause showing.
			</P>
			<P>
			Wiretapping is extraordinarily destructive of individual privacy. It is the worse sort of general search, which necessarily captures not only the communications of its specific targets, but those of countless others who happen to come in contact with the targets or use the same lines.
			</P>
			<P>
			Indeed, while the number of wiretaps has been increasing in recent years, their efficiency has been plummeting. According to the government's own figures, the proportion of incriminating conversations snared by a wiretap (as opposed to so-called innocent or irrelevant conversations) nosedived from 25 percent to 17 percent in the decade between 1984 and 1994. In the early 1970's, the government says, the proportion of incriminating conversations snagged by wiretaps was approximately 50 percent -- nearly three times the efficiency rating the government earns today.
			</P>
			<P>
			Another way of looking at it shows that, on average today, each time a law enforcement wiretap is placed, 83 percent of the conversations the government eavesdrops on will be innocent or non-incriminating even by its own reckoning.
			</P>
			<P>
			This 17 percent efficiency rating is simply unacceptable from a privacy perspective. Would we as a society accept such a low rating on physical searches? Consider the following analogy: If you lived on a block with six houses, and the police had probable cause to believe that drugs are in one of the houses, under the 17 percent efficiency standard it would be perfectly acceptable for them to search your house and the houses of four of your innocent neighbors to find the drugs that might be in the sixth house.
			</P>
			<P>
			This kind of indiscriminate physical search would, of course, be completely unacceptable and no court would ever permit it. Yet, the FBI seems to think that efficiency standard is just fine when it comes to eavesdropping on our conversations.
			</P>
			<P>
			Moreover, although the FBI would have us believe that more wiretapping is needed to save the country from terrorists and prevent another Oklahoma City, the numbers simply do not support the agency. Wiretapping is almost never used to investigate bombings, arson or firearms violations. Indeed, the last time a wiretap was requested by a law enforcement agency to investigate one of these crimes was in 1988. In the past 11 years, fewer than 0.2 percent of all law enforcement wiretap requests were made in connection with such crimes. Instead 83 percent of all electronic surveillance intercepts are used to investigate gambling and drug offenses..
			</P>
			<P>
			To assuage the American public, already jittery from federal law enforcement abuses at Waco and Ruby Ridge and now Filegate, the FBI assures us that it will still have to go to court and demonstrate probable cause to a judge before it is allowed to engage in electronic surveillance. What it neglects to mention, however, is that its requests for wiretaps are almost never turned down by the courts: no request for a &quot;Title III&quot; intercept has been rejected since 1988; no request for a foreign intelligence intercept has been turned down since 1979.
			</P>
			<P>
			The encryption issue is directly related to the government's desire to continue and increase its wiretapping. In many respects, government control of encryption technology, through restrictions on the its strength and the introduction of a key escrow system available to the government, are the lynch pin of the new era of wiretapping.
			</P>
			<P>
			Much of the recent debate over encryption has focused on issues related to stored data. It is plain, however, that from the perspective of the Administration, that they are equally -- I would venture to say perhaps more -- preoccupied with the interception of real time communications or, in more old fashioned terms, wiretapping.
			</P>
			<P>
			The Attorney General, The FBI and the NSA know well that any expansion of their authority to wiretap could easily be frustrated by the increased use of strong encryption.
			</P>
			<P>
			This emphasis has been plain, not only, in the Administration's desire to expand its wiretapping capacity and pass the digital telephony law, but from the comments of key administration figures. The day after the Digital Telephony law passed FBI Director Freeh publicly worried that the law might not work if without additional measures to restrict encryption.
			</P>
			<P>
			Only 10 days ago, Attorney General Janet Reno spoke here in Northern California to the Commonwealth Club of California on then topic of &quot; Law Enforcement in Cyberspace&quot;. The Attorney General identified the &quot; widespread use of encryption&quot; as the first among four major challenges to law enforcement in Information Age.
			</P>
			<P>
			The Attorney General said:
			</P>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>
				&quot; Encryption, as a practical matter, diminishes the power of law enforcement to do its job ... . The consequences of our losing the ability to wiretap would be enormous.&quot;
				</P>
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>
			The combination of the increasingly voracious appetite of the Federal police and intelligence agencies for wiretapping and other forms of intrusive and general surveillance makes this a particularly propitious time for the friends of liberty on and off the Internet to make a stand.
			</P>
			<P>
			We now seem to have the political momentum, but we must be careful not to ask too little from the Congress.
			</P>
			<P>
			It is undeniably important that the export controls be lifted. But we must also resist calls for key escrow schemes that will begin as voluntary measures, but inevitably end with a push for mandating government access to the keys to decryption.
			</P>
			<P>
			&quot;Voluntary&quot; key escrow is a Trojan horse. The only chance such schemes have of working is if they are mandatory and the Intelligence community knows that. At last week's Senate hearing the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) cited a number of documents it had obtained under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) which make this point plain.
			</P>
			<P>
			One briefing document obtained by EPIC and titled &quot;Encryption: The Threat, Applications and Potential Solutions,&quot; and sent to the National Security Council in February 1993, the FBI, NSA and DO concluded that:
			</P>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>
				Technical solutions, such as they are, will only work if they are incorporated into all encryption products. To ensure that this occurs, legislation mandating the use of Government-approved encryption products or adherence to Government encryption criteria is required.
				</P>
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>
			Another undated FBI report titled &quot;Impact of Emerging Telecommunications Technologies on Law Enforcement&quot; observes that &quot;[although the export of encryption products by the United States is controlled, domestic use is not regulated.&quot; The report concludes that &quot;a national policy embodied in legislation is needed.&quot; Such a policy, according to the FBI, must ensure &quot;real-time decryption by law enforcement&quot; and &quot;prohibit cryptography that cannot meet the Government standard.
			</P>
			<P>
			We are now at a historic crossroads. We can use emerging technologies to protect our personal privacy or we can allow law enforcement agencies to use scare tactics about terrorism to con us into a further erosion of our Constitutional rights against unwarranted and generalized searches that have little law enforcement value.

			I. Introduction 
			<P>
			The age of information is a double-edged sword when it comes to civil liberties. On the one hand, the Internet is a true "marketplace of ideas," in which individuals around the globe come together to organize, debate, and share information unrestricted by geographic distances or national borders. It is perhaps the most democratizing medium yet created, as ordinary citizens -- not just large media conglomerates -- have an inexpensive platform for communicating with millions of persons at once with the simple click of a mouse. The Internet has contributed to the spread of democratic values, as online users become active producers of information rather than passive consumers, and netizens with common interests organize to influence public policy and increase oversight of government affairs. On the other hand, the same technology that promotes the First Amendment values of free speech, association, and access to information also poses a serious threat to another fundamental constitutional value -- the right to privacy. 
			<P>
			Technology in the age of information has brought with it a whole new level of privacy concerns. Online communication is fluid, and much of the personal information we send into cyberspace in the form of e-mail messages and postings is easily tracked and stored by others -- including the government. An e-mail message addressed to one individual can be immediately forwarded to thousands. It is impossible to know who might be lurking on mailing lists and chat rooms. Do you have a reasonable expectation of privacy when communicating by private e-mail or through other private online fora? Against whom -- other users, the government, your Internet Service Provider, your boss? Are transmissions to and from mailing lists, Usenet newsgroups, chat rooms, and the web protected from unwanted intrusion? Can the police seize your entire computer system if they suspect you of transmitting illegal material? Do they need a warrant? Can they intercept and monitor your e-mail during transmission? Do you have any recourse if your service provider reveals your private messages to the world? 
			<P>
			There has so far been little legal guidance regarding the right to privacy in the emerging world of online communication. With the exception of a panic-inspired rush to impose strict content regulations on the Internet, legislators have been slow to react to the information age. Courts are struggling to apply old privacy concepts to the new medium of cyberspace, and have not yet resolved many ambiguities in new electronic privacy laws. The following paper is an attempt to summarize the current status of privacy rights in the online world, and to offer a few suggestions for increasing online privacy protections.
			<P>
			II. A Brief History of Privacy Law 
			<P>
			A. Courts 
			<P>
			A brief review of the history of privacy rights in the United States will assist the discussion of the threat to privacy posed by the online world. Although the importance of privacy is deeply ingrained in our political heritage and social psyche, the right is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. But the Bill of Rights is a broad affirmation of personal privacy because it limits the government's power to interfere with individual liberty. For example, the First Amendment recognizes the right to personal autonomy ("the right to be left alone") by guaranteeing the privacy of personal beliefs and associations. The Fourth Amendment imposes limits on government interference with personal autonomy by protecting "persons, houses, papers, and effects" from unreasonable search and seizure. The Fifth Amendment's protection against self incrimination also implicates privacy concerns, prohibiting the government from coercing an individual to reveal private matters. It is only in this century, though, that the courts began to recognize a constitutional right to privacy. 
			<P>
			Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis are credited as the forefathers of privacy law in the United States because of an influential article they wrote in the Harvard Law Review in 1890. They constructed the first legal concept of privacy out of property doctrine, tort law, copyright law, and damage principles. As one commentator noted, "Warren and Brandeis presented the idea of privacy as it should be understood: as deeply entrenched in culture, evolving over time, fundamental to the wholeness of the individual, and reflecting the social environment in which people exist." 
			<P>
			Thus, a number of different principles comprise the modern understanding of the "right to privacy." Initially, the right to privacy was interpreted to include only "protection against tangible intrusions resulting in measurable injury." The common law torts of invasion of privacy, casting another in a bad public light, and physical intrusion into a person's home or solitude are examples of this approach to the right of privacy. Then, in a series of cases in the early part of this century, the Supreme Court began to formulate the constitutional right to privacy. In 
			<U>
				Meyer v. Nebraska
			</U>
			, the Court invalidated a state law prohibiting the teaching of a language other than English because it interfered with personal autonomy. In 
			<U>
				Pierce v. Society of Sisters
			</U>
			, the Court struck down a law requiring all children to attend public schools, recognizing that "the fundamental theory of liberty . . . excludes any general power of the state". Faced with what might be dubbed the first "cyberspace" privacy case, though, the Court was constrained by the property-based notion of privacy; in 
			<U>
				Olmstead v. United States
			</U>
			, the Court held that phone wiretapping did not require a warrant because no physical intrusion was involved. Justice Brandeis wrote a strong dissent, recognizing that "the right to be left alone" was "the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men." 
			<P>
			In 
			<U>
				NAACP v. Alabama
			</U>
			, the Court recognized a First Amendment associational privacy right by refusing to allow a state to compel the disclosure of organization membership lists, articulating the "right of the members to pursue their lawful private interest privately and to associate freely with others" without "the deterrent effect . . . which disclosure of membership lists is likely to have." In 
			<U>
				Griswold v. Connecticut
			</U>
			, the Court held that the Bill of Rights created "zones of privacy" within a "penumbra," striking down a Connecticut statute prohibiting married couples from using contraceptives because the law impermissibly intruded on the marital relationship. The "zone of privacy" surrounding the home led the Court in 
			<U>
				Stanley v. Georgia
			</U>
			to hold that an individual could not be arrested for mere possession of obscene materials in his home. Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote, "If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State cannot tell a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch." The "zone of privacy" reasoning was extended to include a woman's right to choose to have an abortion in 
			<U>
				Roe v. Wade
			</U>
			. 
			<P>
			In 
			<U>
				Katz v. United States
			</U>
			, the Court reversed the 
			<U>
				Olmstead
			</U>
			holding and declared that warrantless wiretapping was unconstitutional. In doing so, the Court articulated a new balancing test that would guide future considerations of the right to privacy. The test weighs the government's interest in a search against the individual's expectation of privacy. Important for discussions of privacy in the online world is 
			<U>
				Katz
			</U>
			's recognition that the right to privacy included not only tangible property but also "an individual's communications, personality, politics, and thoughts." 
			<P>
			Unfortunately, the Supreme Court then began a restrictive trend regarding the right to privacy. In 
			<U>
				Terry v. Ohio
			</U>
			, the Court used its new sliding scale approach to privacy to uphold a police frisk in the absence of probable cause, reasoning that the level of suspicion required should be tailored to the intrusiveness of the search. The anti-privacy trend was also reflected in a series of cases regarding personal information stored on institutional computers. Acknowledging the reluctance of courts to extend privacy protections, privacy advocates turned to Congress. 
			<P>
			B. Legislation 
			<P>
			In the 1970s, Congress passed the Privacy Act, granting individuals the right to see, copy, and correct their federal agency records, and to restrict disclosures of the information without their consent. Congress also created the Privacy Protection Study Commission (PPSC), which concluded after two years that a range of new laws were required to provide legal safeguards for personal records. Unfortunately, very few of the PPSC recommendations have been enacted into law. 
			<P>
			In 1980, Congress passed the Privacy Protection Act (PPA), which provides: 
			<P>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
				Notwithstanding any other law, it shall be unlawful for a government officer or employee, in connection with the investigation . . . of a criminal offense, to search for or seize any work product materials possessed by a person reasonably believed to have a purpose to disseminate to the public a newspaper, book, broadcast or other similar form of public communication.
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>
			The PPA prohibits law enforcement from searching or seizing "work product" and "documentary" materials from journalists and publishers unless they have "probable cause" to believe the person possessing the materials is involved in a crime, and the materials sought are evidence of the crime. Congress enacted the PPA to lessen the chilling effect of intrusive searches on those engaged in activities protected by the First Amendment. 
			<P>
			In 1986, Congress revamped The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), legislation originally enacted in 1968 to prevent telephone wiretapping. ECPA was amended to cover all forms of digital communications (including private e mail), to prevent private entities in addition to the government from unauthorized access, and to prevent unauthorized access to stored messages as well as interception of messages. Unfortunately, the complexity of ECPA is not mirrored by the level of privacy it offers online users. Most significantly, ECPA provides only a set of default rules, all of which can be abrogated by contract between the provider and user or with the consent of the user. III. User Privacy in the Online World 
			<P>
			A. Public versus Private Online Fora 
			<P>
			Several factors affect the level of privacy that online users can expect. First, privacy will vary depending on the forum in which the user is communicating. Generally, only private e-mail and private simultaneous chat is protected. While many online users may think of their postings on Usenet newsgroups and public message boards as "private" because the communications take place in the comfort and safety of their own living room, in fact these fora are the "town halls of cyberspace" -- they are by nature public and are thus entitled to no protection. Law enforcement can roam these public online spaces without a warrant, listening in on conversations and looking for criminal activity. Even mailing lists with limited subscribers (often referred to as "mail exploders" or "listservs") are only as private as the person on the list with the least degree of privacy protection. Thus, if one person or member of a mailing list has a contract with a service provider negating their privacy rights, none of the postings on the list will be considered "private." 
			<P>
			B. Stored Messages versus Messages in Transmission 
			<P>
			Second, the level of privacy protection will vary depending on whether the message is in the process of transmission or is being stored. For example, ECPA provides a much higher level of protection for messages during the process of transmission than for stored communications. Title I of ECPA imposes strong civil and criminal penalties against the government, providers and third parties who intercept electronic messages in live or real-time transmission between users; it also requires a "super-warrant" for law enforcement who wish to intercept electronic messages for the purposes of a criminal investigation. Title II of ECPA, which governs unauthorized access to stored messages, protects only against third party and government access and 
			<U>
				not
			</U>
			against access by the service provider. Penalties for violations of Title II are lighter, and there is no "super-warrant" required before the government can gain access to stored messages during a criminal investigation. "Stored messages" may include messages in the addressee's mailbox waiting to be picked up by the addressee, and records of private online discussions between users. 
			<P>
			C. The Identify of the Intruder 
			<P>
			Third, online privacy rights vary tremendously depending on the identity of the potential intruder. The section below reviews online privacy rights in relation to employers, Internet Service Providers, third parties, and the government. Generally, users have the least privacy protection in relation to their employers (for communications over networks provided by the employer), and the most privacy protection in relation to the government's ability to intrude on non-criminal communications. 
			<P>
			1. Employers 
			<P>
			Many people are first exposed to online communications when their employer provides them with a personal e-mail account. Because electronic mail is a very economical way to communicate and share information and files with clients and business colleagues, especially across long distances, businesses are putting their employees online in increasing numbers. Many employees don't realize that the law recognizes little if any privacy protection in electronic mail sent or received by an employee on their work accounts -- even if the mail is personal and not work-related. While the "Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968" prohibits employers from eavesdropping on the private phone conversations of their employees at work, there is no similar protection of electronic mail communications. The law is still in its infancy, but "most lawyers agree that under current laws, workers do not have privacy rights on in-house company systems unless their employers give them those rights." 
			<P>
			Courts have yet to rule on whether ECPA prevents employers from accessing employee e-mail, but employers are probably exempt from ECPA as applied to company e-mail systems under the "business extension rule" routinely applied to allow employers to monitor company voice mail systems. In addition, &#167;2511(2)(a)(I) of ECPA provides that: 
			<P>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
				It shall not be unlawful . . . for . . . a provider of wire or electronic communication service, whose facilities are used in the transmission of a wire communication, to intercept, disclose, or use that communication in the normal course of his employment while engaged in any activity which is a necessary incident to the rendition of his service or 
				<U>
					to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service
				</U>
				, except that a provider of wire communication service to the public shall not utilize service observing or random monitoring except for mechanical or service quality control checks. [emphasis added]
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
			The exception could be interpreted to allow an employer to access employee e-mail if necessary for "the protection of the [employer's] rights or property." While ECPA may still pose some limitations to an employer's right to monitor or access employee e-mail, these limitations will have to be determined by the courts. 
			<P>
			Electronic privacy rights in the workplace have been considered in a handful of cases, all of which concluded that an employee has no expectation of privacy in her e mail. In 
			<U>
				Shoars v. Epson
			</U>
			, an employee was fired for refusing to participate in her supervisors' monitoring of employee e-mail. She sued for wrongful termination, relying on a California state law that prohibits electronic surveillance. The court held that the statute's protections did not extend to e-mail. In another California case,
			<U>
				Bourke v. Nissan Motors Corp
			</U>
			, the company fired an employee for sending personal messages (some containing sexual content) through the company e-mail system. Bourke sued for wrongful termination, claiming invasion of privacy. That court denied the claim also. It reasoned that Bourke had no reasonable expectation of privacy in her e-mail because she had signed an agreement with the employer that restricted use of the system to company business and because she knew that the employer sometimes monitored electronic messages. 
			<P>
			In 
			<U>
				Smyth v. The Pillsbury Co.
			</U>
			, a federal district court in Philadelphia recently dismissed another wrongful discharge claim from an employee who was fired after the company intercepted "inappropriate and unprofessional comments" that the employee had made to his supervisor over the company e-mail system. The Pillsbury Company had repeatedly assured its employees that all e-mail communications would remain confidential and privileged, and that it would not intercept e-mail or use it as grounds for termination. Smyth argued that his termination was "in violation of public policy which precludes an employer from terminating an employee in violation of the employee's right to privacy as embodied in Pennsylvania common law." Despite the employee's reliance on the company's assurances, the Court held that there was no "reasonable expectation of privacy in e-mail communications voluntarily made by an employee to his supervisor over the company e-mail system. . . . Once plaintiff communicated the alleged unprofessional comments to a second person (his supervisor) over an e-mail system which was apparently utilized by the entire company, any reasonable expectation of privacy was lost." The case sets a disturbing precedent regarding the enforceability of agreements that employers will not monitor employee e-mail. 
			<P>
			2. Internet Service Providers 
			<P>
			Users disturbed by the lack of privacy provided by their company e-mail may decide to purchase their own access to the Internet, either through one of the large commercial service providers like America Online or CompuServe or through a local Internet Service Provider. Almost all service providers have "online service agreements" that may restrict user privacy otherwise protected under ECPA. Unfortunately, most users do not realize they are signing away privacy rights when they go online through a service provider, because most service agreements are "take-it-or-leave-it" contracts. 
			<P>
			In the absence of an agreement, ECPA provides a set of default rules that limit the extent to which service providers may intercept or access the private communications of their users. Title I of ECPA prohibits system operators from intercepting e-mail or private real-time chat messages during transmission. Title II of ECPA allows system operators to look through stored messages, but prevents them from disclosing the messages to third parties (including the government) unless an ECPA exception applies. But because many systems are configured to store all messages that pass through it, "the ability to review stored messages effectively gives the operator the ability to review all messages passing through the system." 
			<P>
			ECPA provides civil remedies for users whose privacy has been violated by their service provider. However, providers who cooperate with law enforcement who present proper warrants or subpoenas are not subject to later action by users. ECPA provides a complex set of rules for the proper disclosure of information by the service provider to law enforcement. Service providers may not provide basic information about users to law enforcement without an administrative subpoena; that information includes user name, billing address, how long the user has used the service, and which features were used. Service providers may not disclose the content of messages less than 180 days old to law enforcement without a warrant. (Neither the government nor the provider are required to inform the subscriber.) Service providers may not disclose the content of messages more than 180 days old to law enforcement without a warrant, or government notice to the subscriber and an administrative subpoena or court order. Service providers may reveal any stored message to law enforcement if the provider accidentally comes across the message. (Law enforcement are required to obtain a warrant to intercept future messages or conduct further review on their own.) 
			<P>
			Service providers are also forbidden from disclosing the transactional records of a user to law enforcement without a warrant, a court order, or the consent of the user. However, ECPA explicitly allows service providers to disclose the transactional records of users to "any person other than a governmental entity." 
			<P>
			3. Third Parties and Hackers 
			<P>
			Cyberculture is notorious for its hackers -- net savvy youth who like to show off their skills by cracking and invading computer systems. Although the damage from these intrusions is often minimal, the privacy violation is not. The law imposes criminal penalties on third parties who intercept private communications or stored messages without the user's consent. Title I of ECPA (intercepted messages) provides for fines and/or imprisonment up to five years. Title II of ECPA (stored messages) provides for a fine of up to $5000, or imprisonment for up to six months, or both. If the offense is committed "for purposes of commercial advantage, malicious destruction or damage, or private commercial gain," Title II provides for a fine of up to $250,000 or imprisonment up to two years, or both. Hackers can also be prosecuted under the federal wire fraud statute, theft of government property, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Users damaged by the activities of hackers may also seek civil damages under ECPA. 
			<P>
			4. Government and Law Enforcement 
			<P>
			a. The Fourth Amendment in Cyberspace 
			<P>
			When dealing with the government, online users enjoy constitutional privacy protections in addition to statutory ones. The Fourth Amendment forbids unreasonable searches and seizures and requires that warrants issue only with probable cause. Under prevailing law, any interception or access to private electronic communications -- regardless of whether the police listen in on your e-mail conversations, ask your service provider for past messages, or knock down your door and seize your entire computer system -- constitutes a "seizure" under the Fourth Amendment. However, users must remember that the Fourth Amendment does not protect against police who "go undercover online" to gather evidence in 
			<I>
				public
			</I>
			areas of online systems, because there is no expectation of privacy in such areas. 
			<P>
			Law enforcement may attempt to seize computer systems if (1) the system itself is suspected of criminal activity; (2) law enforcement believe that evidence of a crime committed by others is available through the system. Although the normal warrant rules apply, many questions regarding warrants for computer evidence have not yet been answered. For example, may law enforcement seize an entire computer system, including all the files on the hard drive, if it suspects that one illegal e-mail message has been transmitted on the computer? Or must law enforcement specify with particularity the illegal files they seek, and limit their search only to those files? 
			<P>
			Users whose systems have been subjected to seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment may seek redress under a Section 1983 action. If criminal charges are brought against the user based on an illegal seizure, the user may seek to exclude the tainted evidence. In addition, state constitutional claims may be asserted. So far, ten states have amended their Constitutions to include an explicit right to privacy: Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, South Carolina, and Washington. 
			<P>
			b. Statutory Rights 
			<P>
			i. ECPA 
			<P>
			Under ECPA, law enforcement must meet much higher standards than required for an ordinary warrant in order to intercept private e-mail. Users may recover civil damages against law enforcement who violate ECPA. However, law enforcement may assert as a defense a "good faith reliance" on a warrant or court order. To search and seize stored messages from a user's personal computer, law enforcement need only meet the regular warrant requirements. ECPA provides lighter standards for standards for law enforcement to obtain access to some stored messages from the user's service provider. 
			<P>
			The distinction between a "stored message" and a "transmitted message" may affect an online user's privacy rights in relation to law enforcement. In 
			<U>
				Steve Jackson Games v. U.S.
			</U>
			, a federal court held that unread e-mail was a "stored communication" rather than a "transmission," which entitled it to lesser protections under ECPA. This interpretation provides a dangerous loophole that may allow law enforcement to bypass the strict warrant requirements for interception of e-mail messages. Rather than comply with the strict interception requirements, law enforcement can go to the suspect's service provider, sometimes with a mere administrative subpoena, and get access to stored e-mail communications. Hopefully, future courts will realize the abrogation of privacy rights inherent in an interpretation that unread e-mail qualifies only as a "stored message" under ECPA, and will hold instead that law enforcement must meet the interception warrant requirements whenever they seek access to unread e-mail. 
			<P>
			i. Privacy Protection Act 
			<P>
			Online systems and their users are protected by the PPA "to the extent they act as publishers and maintain publishing-related materials on the system." Electronic newsletters, e-mail, web pages, and other electronic databases, if not available publicly, may all be protected under the PPA. PPA provides for civil damages against the government and individual agents. As a defense, agents may assert a "reasonable good faith belief" that their conduct was lawful. In 
			<U>
				Steve Jackson Games
			</U>
			, the Court appeared to accept as a "good faith" defense an agent's assertion that he did not know that the PPA applied to online systems, a ruling that will hopefully not be replicated in other jurisdictions. 
			<P>
			c. 
			<U>
				Steve Jackson Games
			</U>
			<P>
			One of the most dramatic examples of an overbroad search and seizure of an online system is the case of 
			<U>
				Steve Jackson Games v. US
			</U>
			. Steve Jackson Games was a small company that designed online role-playing games; it had a computer bulletin board for customer support. Federal agents were after a hacker group known as the "Legion of Doom," and one of the suspected members worked for Steve Jackson Games. The agents raided the company, seizing the online system computer, many extraneous computer parts, printers, and other equipment unrelated to the daily operation of any online system. They had only an unsigned photocopy of a warrant. They also seized a book under development called "GURPS Cyberpunk," a role playing game that described various exotic ways to break into computer systems in an imaginary future world. The agents thought they had come upon a real hacker handbook, but computer experts say that anyone with even limited knowledge of online technology would have known immediately that the handbook was entirely fictional. Law enforcement failed to return any of the equipment for several months, resulting in much damage to the business. Neither Steve Jackson Games nor any other person was ever criminally charged as a result of the raid. Steve Jackson Games sued under ECPA and PPA, and won damages; individual users of the system were also awarded damages.
			<P>
			IV. Conclusion: Negotiating for Increased Privacy 
			<P>
			The above review reveals the limitations of current privacy protections for online communications. Most significantly, statutory protections can be reduced or negated through private agreement. But private agreements can also be used to 
			<I>
				increase
			</I>
			user privacy. Users may negotiate for stronger privacy protections with two of the four potential privacy intruders -- employers and service providers. In addition, such agreements, and the level of system security they require, may limit the ability of law enforcement and third parties to gain access to the user's communications. 
			<P>
			Currently, the trend in service agreements, both with employers and service providers, has been for lessened privacy protection. Many system operators who fear liability for the illegal actions of their users require all users to sign contracts that authorize the system operator to snoop at will, completely negating the ECPA privacy rights. This is a bad business decision for two reasons. First, virtually all crimes contain a "knowledge" requirement. Providers who routinely review e-mail messages are more likely to be seen as "knowing" the contents of those messages, and thus to expose themselves to criminal liability, than providers who never review messages. 
			<P>
			Second, the higher the level of privacy granted by the provider to its users, the higher the level of protection against government seizure of the entire online system. The privacy rights of the online system are based largely on the privacy rights of its users. A contract provision that allows providers to snoop in e-mail means that there are no private messages on the system. Thus, by definition, everyone has equal authority to look at the messages, including law enforcement. Law enforcement agents could seize and then roam through the entire system, reading random e-mail even of persons not directly associated with the initial investigation. Conversely, if the online system gives strong privacy rights to its users, law enforcement must tailor their warrant very narrowly to specific messages between those users suspected of criminal activity. 
			<P>
			Online users can use these arguments to lobby for strong privacy protections for e-mail at work; the Electronic Mail Association has provided useful sample agreements. The same arguments can be used to persuade Internet Service Providers to change their online service agreements to provide for stronger privacy protections for their customers. Of course, citizens, privacy advocates, and civil rights lawyers should also work to increase online privacy protections through new legislation and case law. There remains much to be done to secure the fundamental right of privacy in the new sphere of cyberspace.

is vital to the both the growth of electronic commerce and to the Internet as a
means of mass and democratic communication.  	</P>
<P>The United States Government currently prohibits the export of strong
cryptography. It treats encryption software as an armament to be controlled by
the government. The export ban has discouraged U.S. software companies, who must
 compete in a global market, from including strong cryptography even in products
for the domestic market.   	</P>
<P>Even more ominously, the Clinton Administration has proposed a series of
measures, which began with the infamous Clipper Chip to be built into
communications hardware, that would enable the government to easily obtain the
keys to decrypt private communications.  Clipper II and III are schemes for the
&quot;voluntary escrow&quot; of private keys that would all too quickely turn
into a manditory program.</P>
<P>Senate Bill 1726 Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era sponsored
by Senator Burns of Montana (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996, would: 
</P>
<P>- Allow for the unrestricted export of &quot;mass-market&quot; or &quot;public-domain&quot;
encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy and popular
World Wide Web browsers. 
</P>
<P>- Require the Secretary of Commerce to allow the unrestricted export of
other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are generally
available outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>- Prohibit the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow
encryption policies on the domestic market and limit the authority of the
Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products.   	</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote>
<i>"Cyberspace must be free!"</i><p>

The U.S. is in the midst of a communications revolution brought about by the remarkable capabilities of new interactive technologies.  Cyberspace is probably the richest source of creative, diverse, empowering and democratizing communication ever developed.  It is, perhaps, the world's first true "mass media" because it allows anyone with a few simple tools to communicate their ideas to thousands of people at once at practically no cost.
<p>
In the past year, an unprecendented wave of censorship and overzealous law enforcement has swept through the online world.  State and federal legislators proposed and passed legislation to criminalize online speech.  Police raided community bulletin boards and seized entire systems, based on evidence that a minuscule portion of files might be legally obscene.  The privacy rights of online users were threatened by indiscriminate snooping and interference by government and industry in private e-mail.  And California BBS operators were convicted under the community standards of Memphis, Tennessee.
<p>
All the innovation and citizen empowerment inspired by online communications will be lost if civil liberties don't apply in cyberspace.

Issue Summary -- Death Penalty 
</TITLE>

<P>
<blockquote>
<I>"There will be no lasting peace either in the heart of individuals or in social customs until death is outlawed."</I><BR>
<b>Albert Camus, Reflections on the Guillotine</b>
<P>
The death penalty, outlawed in most of Europe, Canada, Australia, and most other countries in the world, is still practiced in almost forty states, and currently enjoys broad public support.  This was not always the case.  In the 60's and 70's, a bare majority of Americans favored capital punishment.  But mounting fear of crime, and the cynical manipulation of the death penalty issue by many politicians for their own political gain, led to a shift upwards.
<P>
The ACLU and other death penalty opponents, including many religious groups and individuals, and a growing number of prison wardens, maintain that capital punishment constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Killing, whether carried out by an individual or the state, is immoral and ought not to be condoned.  Furthermore, the death penalty as practiced in the U.S. is  arbitrary and racially biased.  It has no proven deterrent value.  And many miscarriages of justice have been documented over the years in which people have been put to death for crimes they did not commit.
<P>
Today, there are more than 3,000 people on death row.  Executions -- by hanging, electrocution, lethal injection, and even by firing squad -- have become almost commonplace.  Regardless of which method is used, the death penalty is a barbaric anachronism and should be abolished.
<P>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">ACLU POSITION STATEMENT ON PRENATAL AND NEWBORN HIV TESTING</H1>
<P>The American Civil Liberties Union opposes mandatory, non-consensual HIV
testing of pregnant women and newborns.  We all have the right, protected by the
Constitution, to be free of unnecessary government control.  To take any
compulsory medical action -- such as forced HIV testing -- the government must
prove that there is no less intrusive means of achieving its goal of promoting
public health.  In the case of pregnant women and newborns, the facts do not
justify mandatory HIV testing but rather show that counseling and voluntary
testing is a less intrusive way of promoting health.  Indeed, counseling and
voluntary testing are more effective than forced testing because they encourage
women to receive ongoing medical care for themselves and their babies, instead
of driving them away from health care services.  The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), the government's own medical experts, have recommended
counseling and voluntary testing, as opposed to mandatory testing.  (CDC Draft
Guidelines for HIV Counseling and Voluntary Testing for Pregnant Women, February
21, 1995, 60 Fed. Reg. 36 at 10086 (Feb. 23, 1995)).  Opponents of testing
without consent also include the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the
American College of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (ACOG) and the March of Dimes.</P>
<H3>CDC HIV-Testing of Newborns. </H3>
<P>The CDC currently tests unidentified blood samples of newborns in order to
better understand the nature and extent of HIV in this country.  Because the CDC
testing is done not for the purpose of diagnosis but for statistical tracking,
the samples are not name-labelled, nor are they collected or tested in the
manner in which a sample would be if it were to be tested for diagnostic
purposes.  The CDC's mission is not to provide diagnostic laboratory testing,
and the CDC may very well consider a testing program that had to be redesigned
to accommodate diagnostic as well as epidemiological uses to be excessively
compromised.  Thus, &quot;unblinding&quot; of the CDC study could result in no
universal newborn HIV screening for any purpose.</P>
<H3>Newborn Testing Cannot Prevent Prenatal HIV Transmission.</H3>
<P>The results of HIV tests of newborns indicate not whether the newborn is
HIV-infected, but whether maternal HIV antibodies are present.  (Kenneth
McIntosh, Sandra K. Burchett, Clearance of HIV-Lessons From Newborns, 332 New
Eng. J. Med. 883 (1995)).  If a newborn tests positive, we learn that the mother
has HIV and that the odds are roughly one in four that the infant itself is HIV
positive.  (McIntosh et al.).  Unfortunately, there is no post-birth treatment
at this time to reduce these odds -- AZT or other anti-retroviral drugs do not
prevent sero-conversion in the infant.  The primary treatment is antibiotics
administered prophylactically several times a day to ward off PCP (an
AIDS-induced pneumonia that is particularly virulent in infants) and to wait for
a period of several weeks, after which it is possible to determine an infant's
own HIV status by further laboratory tests.</P>
<P>However, before and during birth, steps can be taken to reduce the risk of
maternal-infant transmission.  One study suggests that AZT given after the
fourteenth week of pregnancy, continued during delivery and given to the new
infant for the first six weeks of life can reduce the risk of infection to the
infant by as much as two-thirds, from approximately 25% (one in four) to 8% (one
in twelve).  (Edward M. Connor, et al., Reduction of Maternal-Infant
Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 with Zidovudine Treatment,
331 N. Eng. J. Med. 1173, November 4, 1994).</P>
<P>Any opportunity for prevention of in utero HIV infection makes bringing
women into prenatal care crucial.  Not only does prenatal care decrease the risk
of prematurity with its markedly increased mortality, it also provides the
opportunity for the woman to learn about her HIV status and the benefits and
risks of AZT treatment as a prevention for infecting her infant.  Additionally,
knowledge of maternal HIV status before birth makes possible a decision to
deliver by caesarian section, which is believed to further reduce the risk of
infecting the infant.   Another reason for early detection of HIV infection in
pregnancy is to advise the infected mother not to breast feed.  Although this
has not been a major problem in the United States because so few women at higher
risk of HIV infection breast feed, proponents of mandatory HIV testing of
newborns cite protection against infection from breastfeeding as one of the
benefits of such testing.  They ignore the critical fact that breastfeeding must
begin shortly after birth, several days before existing tests can be completed
to determine the presence of maternal HIV antibodies.  In fact, colostrum, the
breast secretion during the first early days after birth, may pose a greater
threat of infection to the infant than milk produced thereafter.  These facts
provide further support for the importance of prenatal care, including
counseling and voluntary testing, as opposed to mandatory newborn testing.</P>
<H3>Counseling and Voluntary Testing Are More Effective Than Mandatory Testing 
                                     </H3>
<P>As the CDC has recently confirmed, counseling and voluntary testing of
pregnant women for HIV is more effective than mandatory testing.  (CDC Draft
Guidelines, February 21, 1995).  Mandatory testing of pregnant women and
newborns would have detrimental public health consequences, most significantly
by deterring women, especially low income women, from seeking prenatal care at
all.  Whenever mandatory testing has been imposed people have been frightened
away.  For example, during the two years that the state of Illinois required
HIV-antibody testing of people seeking marriage licenses, approximately 40,000
people left the state to get married elsewhere.  (Endstad, AIDS Test Has 40,000
Fleeing State to Wed, Chicago Tribune, January 4, 1989, at C1).</P>
<P>By frightening women away from health care providers both during and after
pregnancy, some HIV-infected children will neither be identified nor treated. 
Mandatory testing of a recalcitrant patient will accomplish only ascertainment
of HIV status -- it does not get either the mother or her child into treatment. 
Any type of effective medical treatment for children requires the participation
and cooperation of their caretakers.  Proper management of chronic, infectious,
incurable disease in a family requires a tremendous amount of effort -- and
mother and doctor teamwork -- over time, particularly when both mother and child
are afflicted.  Medicines must be given regularly, procedures must be developed
and followed, regular doctor's visits are critical.  Without trust there is
rarely compliance, especially when a woman is confronting not only the
possibility that her child has an incurable disease but the certainty that she
does as well.</P>

<P>Another fact which would drive women away from health care providers who
forcibly test them or their children is that these women are susceptible to the
same kinds of discrimination faced by others if it becomes known that they are
infected with HIV.  The possible losses of custody of their children, of their
jobs, health insurance, apartments, and other harms, including the risk of
broader disclosure and dissemination of their HIV status, are all very real
concerns.  In addition, many African-American and Latina women may fear
mandatory testing and the disclosure of the results based on past histories of
discrimination and also due to past negative experiences with health care
providers.</P>
<P>In other situations where there is undisputed medical value in learning test
results, the sensitivity of the issues involved and the nature of the personal
decisions they engender has led to a recognition that such tests should be done
only when the patient consents.  For example, amniocentesis testing for
chromosomal abnormalities and hereditary diseases is recommended for pregnant
women over age 35 -- but it is not mandated by law.  Screening for Downs'
syndrome and sickle cell diseases are treated similarly.  While syphilis testing
for pregnant women is mandatory, syphilis can be safely and effectively cured
and mandatory syphilis testing does not drive women away from health care
providers.</P>
<P>Currently there is no requirement that pregnant women be routinely educated
about HIV and possible treatments to reduce the risk of infecting their babies,
or given the opportunity to be tested for HIV.  Yet such counseling at the
beginning of pregnancy makes the most sense in terms of the parent's
decision-making ability about health consequences for the child.  Routine
non-coercive counseling regarding the benefits and burdens of testing and
treatment ensures that rational choices are made by the prospective parents at
the most appropriate time.  Linking testing to the provision of services has
been shown to increase the rate of voluntary consent for testing.  Experience
indicates that under these circumstances most women will probably agree to be
tested, and they can then make informed decisions about the use of AZT,
antibiotics and other treatments while pregnant or after birth.  For example, at
Harlem Hospital in New York City, over 90% of counseled women consent to
testing.  (Report of the Subcommittee on Newborn HIV Screening of the New York
State AIDS Advisory Council, February 10, 1994 at 32).  Similar proportions have
been reported at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, at Grady
Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia and elsewhere.  (Michael K. Lindsay, et al.,
Determinants of Acceptance of Routine Voluntary Human Immunodeficiency Virus
Testing in an Inner-City Prenatal Population, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Vol.
78, No. 4, October 1991 at 678 (acceptance of testing rate was 97%); Michael K.
Lindsay, et al., Routine Antepartum Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection
Screening in an Inner-City Population, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Vol. 74, No.
3, Part 1, September 1989 at 289 (acceptance of testing rate was 96%)).  If,
after counseling, women do not get tested for HIV, they will have the knowledge
to make reasoned choices about breast-feeding, caesarean sections and
termination of the pregnancy.</P>
<P>A non-coercive health care environment, ongoing care, and access to services
are what will bring women and children to health care services -- mandatory HIV
testing will drive them away.</P>
<H3>Mandatory Testing of Pregnant Women and Newborns Is Unconstitutional       
                           </H3>
<P>Counseling and voluntary HIV testing are a constitutionally required less
intrusive alternative to mandatory testing of pregnant women and newborns. 
Non-consensual testing implicates a broad range of constitutional protections. 
Pregnant women and mothers of newborns, like everyone else in this country, have
the right to decision-making about their own bodies; the right to control over
medical information; the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures
by the government; and the right to direct the course of their medical treatment
and the medical treatment of their children.  They also have the right to equal
protection of the law, which is called into question by testing provisions which
single out pregnant women, but not men considering having children, as well as
by disproportionately affecting women of color.</P>
<P>When these rights are intruded upon, the Constitution requires that the
government act in the least intrusive way that will further its goal.  The goal
of HIV-testing programs is the promotion of health.  Counseling and voluntary
testing are far less intrusive measures than mandatory, non-consensual testing,
and experience strongly indicates that counseling and voluntary testing will
more effectively further the goal of promoting health than forced testing would.</P>
<H3>Recommendation</H3>
<P>More than a decade into the AIDS epidemic in this country we have learned
that the spread of HIV is most effectively controlled by voluntary, rather than
coercive, measures.  If we are truly concerned with the health of women and
children then this principle must not be forgotten.  To advance the health of
women and children and to comply with the constitutional imperative of least
intrusive alternatives, counseling and voluntary testing and treatment programs
for pregnant women and newborns should be implemented to encourage them to
receive ongoing medical care.</P>

Issue Summary -- Racial Equality

<blockquote>


<P>
<i>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."</i><br><b> The Declaration of Independence</b><p>
The legal barriers to racial equality have been torn down, and racial exclusion from the benefits of society and the rights of citizenship is no longer nearly total, as it once was.  But discrimination still limits the opportunities and stifles the hopes of many black Americans and other minorities.  In the realms of housing, employment, medical care, education and the administration of the criminal justice system, we are still, as the 1968 Kerner Commission Report on civil disorders warned, two separate Americas.  
<p>
At this moment in our nations history, it is critical that we move definitively forward in remedying the effects of discrimination.  But tragically, the most successful civil rights remedies have come under attack from conservative politicians and pundits.  Affirmative action, for example, which is to be credited with the creation of an increasingly diverse workforce, has come under intense criticism.  Voting rights laws, which have begun to integrate the halls of Congress and state legislatures, are also under attack. 
<p>
As long as our society is ridden with race-based problems, we will need  race-based remedies.  And while we have come a long way, we still have a long way to go.

Issue Summary -- Worker's Rights

<P>
<blockquote>
<i>"Every time I passed through those plant gates to go to work, I left America, and my rights as a free man.  I spent nine hours in there, in prison, and then came out into my country again."</i>
<p>
The Constitution does not apply to the private sector.  In the 18th Century, when the Constitution was ratified, only the government was seen as a major threat to individual rights.  Today, many if not most Americans are more vulnerable to violations of their rights by employers than the early Americans were by the government.   Although some forms of discrimination are prohibited by state and federal laws, most other rights are not protected.  Private sector employees, and especially those who do not belong to a union, can be fired for any reason, without due process.  They can be compelled to submit to urine drug tests on pain of losing their job.  They can be punished for their political views.  And they can be subjected to secret computer and telephone monitoring.  
<p>
People should not have to hang up the Bill of Rights at the time clock or the office door.  Employees are not pieces of equipment.  Treating them with dignity and fairness is not inconsistent with good, competitive, management.  

<P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">It Can Happen to You!<BR>Stories of Employment Discrimination
</H2><P>All too often people who perform their job well are fired simply
because
they are gay. They seldom have any recourse to fight this blatant
discrimination. The stories below demonstrate that just how much ENDA is
needed.
<P><IMG SRC="/graphics/cf.gif">In her her first four years as a reporter
for a Los Angeles weekly
newspaper, Cynthia Frazier received glowing reviews, won numerous awards
for her
writing, and quickly advanced from news editor and writer to associate editor.
But after her supervisor noticed vacation photos on Frazier's desk of her
and
her partner hugging, the atmosphere changed. Frazier was constantly harassed
and
reprimanded at work and eventually fired for insubordination. Frazier filed
suit
in 1994 arguing she had been fired for being gay. The case is now on appeal.
<P><IMG SRC="/graphics/sm.gif">After participating in a parade protesting
Oregon's 1992 anti-gay
initiative, Fireman Steve Morrison found himself systematically shunned and
harassed at work. His co-workers caught a glimpse of him on the local news'
coverage of the event and falsely assumed he was gay. Steve received hate
mail,
was charged with incompetence, and was eventually taken off driver "rotation"
-- a career threatening blot on his record. After lengthy administrative
proceedings Steve was able to get the trumped-up charges removed from his
record
and transferred to another station.
<P>After landing a dream job in the Georgia Attorney General's office Robin
Shahar decided to seal the commitment she had made to the woman she had been
sharing a home with since 1988. Several weeks before the big day, Robin was
called into the Attorney General's office for an impromptu meeting. She thought
she would be hearing about her first assignment, but instead was handed a
pink
slip. The AG had learned of her wedding plans and decided to rescind the
job
offer.
<P>Daniel Miller, an accountant from Pennsylvania, was fired when his employer
of more than five years evoked a clause in his job contract that barred gays
from the company. Unable to file suit because Pennsylvania does not protect
against discrimination based on sexual orientation, Daniel established his
own
accounting firm. Many of his former clients followed him. His former boss
then
took him to court and won a $172,000 award because the clients had switched.
<P>In 1991, Cracker Barrel restaurants adopted a policy refusing to employ
anyone "whose sexual preferences fail to demonstrate normal heterosexual
values." When Cheryl Summerville, a cook at an Atlanta suburbs franchise,
learned that management had fired certain gay employees, she told her manager
she was a lesbian. Reluctantly, her manager gave her an official separation
notice reading "This employee is being terminated due to violation of
company policy. The employee is gay."
<P>In 1994, Mark Sension was hired by the University of Denver to be the
Associate Director for Operation of the Ricks Center for Gifted Children,
a
private school run by the University. About a month later, his supervisor
learned that he is gay. Soon after, Mark was fired without warning and escorted
from the building by university security personnel. He was told his firing
was
an "issue of trust" because he did not make his sexual orientation
clear during the hiring interview.
<P>Jeffrey Blain was hired in January 1993 to work in sales for a Golden
State
Container, a Phoenix-area manufacturer. He had a good work record, receiving
a
37.5 percent raise during his first six months. But several months later,
the
company fired him for no reason. Blain took Golden State to court, claiming
that
he was fired because he is a gay man. The judge instructed the jury that
"an
employee is not wrongfully terminated if he is fired for being homosexual."
Blain lost his case when the Arizona Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's
ruling saying that discriminating against a worker on his or her sexual
orientation violates no laws or public policy.

<p>
The HIV epidemic is a health crisis.  But since it began in the U.S. in the early 1980's, the collateral social consequences of the epidemic have also been catastrophic.  Over and over again, people with HIV disease were -- without medical justification --  denied access to employment, housing, schools, health care and other basic social rights, and the search for a cure was joined by a struggle for basic civil rights.  AIDS forces American society to confront the conflict between individual and community interests in the formulation of public policy.
<p>
In dealing with the AIDS crisis, the government must be guided by three principles:  (1) that public policy must be based on medical facts and realities, not ignorance and prejudice; (2) that the AIDS crisis must not become a pretext for unjustified violations of individual rights; and (3) that the least restrictive measures possible must be used to achieve public health goals.

<center><h1>Transcript of Substantive Plenary VI<br>
Rights of Gays and Lesbians</h1></center>
<blockquote>
              MS. FELDBLUM:  It really is the best of
    times and the worst of times for people who care
    about gay and lesbian, bisexual civil rights.  In
    one respect we're in a better position than we have
    been for a very long time.  I have worked on this
    issue fewer years than some of the other people
    that you will hear from.  But even in the last 0
    years that I've worked on this in Washington, I
    feel that there are qualitatively different
   feelings towards working on this issue.  It is, in
   that sense, the best of times.<p>
              And what I will talk about in my piece,
   is where we are going in terms of getting civil
   rights protections, both legislatively and
   judicially, both on the federal level and on state
   and local levels.  And much of the story around
   that is around the best of times.  It is also, in
   some respect the best of times in other areas, such
   as marriage and family.  And Tom Stoddard will be
   talking about the initiatives that have occurred in
   those areas.                                       <p>
              It is also the worst of times.  There
   are new and different obstacles that have now come
   up against people who are striving to achieve these
   rights.  And Matt Coles will talk about some of
     those obstacles that we face in the legal arena,
    things like Amendment  in Colorado.  And Urvashi
    Vaid will talk about how to deal with some of those
    obstacles in an organizational fashion.                                           <p>
               I'm going to start with -- we decided,
    unlike some things, we were going to start with the
    best of times.  Although you will see in each of
    our presentations, we each have an understanding
    and an acknowledgement of this list in each
   respect. <p>
              But I am going to start with the effort
   to achieve civil rights protection on the basis of
   sexual orientation in areas like employment, public
   accommodation, housing, governmental services.  <p>
              Okay, just to sort of lay the ground for
   where we're at -- I know some of this is known, but
   I want to make sure we're all working with the same
   info -- as most of you know, private actor
   discrimination, that is discrimination undertaken
   by private actors, a private employer that fires me
   because I'm a lesbian, a private landlord that
   kicks me out of my apartment because I'm a lesbian,
   a restaurant that kicks me and my lover out of the
   restaurant because we're holding hands, okay?  Any
   discrimination on the part of a private actor is
    not illegal under federal law.  There is no
    redress.  You can't even think of going into court,
    there's no federal law.      <p>
               There are eight states around the
    country that do have laws that prohibit such
    discrimination --                  <p>
               AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Nine.           <p>
               MS. FELDBLUM:  -- nine, that's right.
    I'm sorry, Rhode Island.  Yeah.             <p>
              I forgot.  It's been too long a day, I
   can tell, which is good.  It's like when I used to
   talk about the ADA after it was passed, and I kept
   saying, the bill, the bill.  And I'd have to go:
   It's a law now.  It's a law.<p>
               -- nine states and a number of
   localities.  But clearly, if you don't live in one
   of those nine states or any one of those
   localities, there is no protection.<p>
              If a public actor discriminates against
   me, if a public university that I'm teaching at
   would fire me or public housing, I can
   theoretically go into court under the
   Constitution.  Under the Constitution you get equal
   protection of the laws and I can say this denies me
   the equal protection of the laws.  The key point
    there will be under what standard the court
    evaluates my challenge, whether essentially they
    treat me like an optometrist or they treat me like
    a women or a racial minority. <p>
               In other words, will they have a very
    lenient standard of review -- what's called the
    rational basis standard of review, in which case
    the act of discrimination will probably go
    unchallenged, that is it will be upheld -- or if
   they impose a strict standard of review. <p>
              Now, I will not go into the intricacies
   of those standards of review here.  This is just to
   say that in the judicial arena, which only applies
   against public actors, we, as gay people, have not
   tended to fair very well.  We have tended to get
   the lowest standard of review.  And now that you
   have, through the ACLU's America Online, with the
   ACLU being online, those of you who are
   particularly interested in that issue, there should
   be next week, online, the brief that I wrote on
   behalf of a number of gay groups and women's
   groups, with a lot of input from other people on
   this panel, that dealt specifically with the
   standard of review.  And you should feel free to
   download the whole 30 pages, and Phil Gutis will be
    so excited that he can write more numbers of people
    who are downloading.    <p>
               So, we can get protection through a
    statutory protection for private actors, which is
    the key, and we could get that through a federal
    law in the way that exists on the basis of race,
    gender, religion, disability -- there is now a
    federal law prohibiting such discrimination -- or
    we can get it through state and local laws.<p>
              Here is where I think that we are in the
   best of times, in the sense that the landscape has
   changed significantly, in terms of the effort
   towards getting such laws on the local, state and
   federal level. <p>
              When I started working at the ACLU, I
   was there from '88 to '92.  I was fortunate enough
   to be there at the culmination of the disabilities
   community's efforts to have the civil rights
   community at large understand that disability
   rights were civil rights.  And it was because the
   Leadership Conference on Civil Rights made the
   Americans with Disabilities Act a legislative
   priority that that bill was able to become a law in
   the two years that it took.  There was no doubt
   that it was that coalition effort that made the
     difference. <p>
               I remember saying in 1990, turning to
    Mort Halperin, who was then my boss at the
    Washington office, at an LCCR dinner where they
    were talking about the ADA's passage, and I said:
    "This will never happen for gay men and lesbians.
    We will never be a legislative priority for the
    LCCR, it won't happen."  Because the sense I got
    working with wonderful people in lots of
   organizations, was that they were not happy to make
   lesbian and gay rights a legislative priority.  And
   Mort said to me:  "I think you're wrong.  I think
   they will."     <p>
              And in fact, the landscape changed in
   Washington, D.C. dramatically in the fall of 1991.
   No press release, no major hoopla, but the ground
   moved, because in the fall of 1991 the executive
   committee of the Leadership Conference on Civil
   Rights voted to make a gay and lesbian civil rights
   bill something that the coalition would potentially
   endorse.  I was just a first step.  It was just
   giving the mandate to a drafting group to work on a
   bill, but it was key.  And it was the efforts of
   people like Mort and Ralph Neas and Pat Wright and
   other of our colleagues in the other civil rights
   organizations that made that possible.<p>
               Well, from 1991, from that time until
    now, it took two years to draft the Employment
    Non-Discrimination Act which was introduced in the
    last Congress and was introduced again in this
    Congress.  And the key thing I want to say about
    that bill, in terms of work by a group like the
    ACLU, is the following:  No. , the bill was
    intentionally crafted to be pragmatic.  That is,
   the bill just covers employment.  It doesn't cover
   anything, it just covers employment.  And there
   were compromises that were made in terms of not
   mandating benefits for domestic partners within the
   federal bill, having the relatively broad religious
   exemption, excluding transgender folks from
   coverage under that law.  <p>
              There were changes -- there were
   decisions made in that bill to make it pragmatic.
   However, none of those decisions affected the core
   protection of that bill, which is to say that an
   employer cannot use sexual orientation as a basis
   for employment discrimination, and sexual
   orientation harassment on the job is covered, just
   like gender harassment or racial harassment.  <p>
              Now, the question is, can this bill
     pass?  And this is, in my mind, still within the
    context of this is the best of times.  I believe
    this law can pass.  And I believe that the process
    that will occur in order to make it pass will
    itself be essential toward changing attitudes in
    this country and thereby changing the lives of
    lesbian and gay men in this country.  <p>
               No. , I believe it will pass, because
    there is an effort to make this a bipartisan bill,
   and that was apparent in the introduction of this
   bill just two weeks ago, when it was introduced.
   That Republicans stood up and said: "This is a good
   bill, because no one should be discriminated
   against."  And the fact is that when you look at
   public opinion -- and the ACLU just ran a great ad
   in The New York Times about this -- most Americans
   believe that it's wrong for someone to be denied a
   job just because they're gay.  Now, most of these
   people also think such a law already exists.  But,
   you know, if you can get to the member and say,
   look, public opinions says that they think this is
   okay.       <p>
              But that's not enough.  It's not enough
   to just have the poll, the public opinion poll that
   says people don't think that they should be fired
   from a job just because they're gay, because the
    member is still afraid.  The member of Congress is
    still afraid to vote yes because the 30-second
    spot. <p>
               So I believe that one of the key things
    to make this work is not just from the top down.
    The bill has to exist at the top, so there is
    something to work toward.  But the work comes from
    the bottom, from across the country.  That is,
   No. , the best thing that will make this law pass,
   is if there are more local and state laws that
   prohibit discrimination.  Governor Weld of
   Massachusetts, Governor Whitman from New Jersey
   have both come out in favor of ENDA.  Guess what,
   Massachusetts already has such a law, New Jersey
   already has such a law.  It is much easier for
   someone to come out in support of the federal law
   if there's already a state law.  <p>
              And it is much easier to get a state law
   if you have localities within the state that have
   such a law.  The way to make this law pass on the
   federal level is to build the protections from the
   local level and the state levels.  And what that
   will mean, is that in the 0 to 5 states that we
   will never get such a law -- unfortunately, but we
   will not -- the other 30 states having laws will
    help pass the federal law and then we'll in fact
    have complete protection.<p>
               The second reason why passing state and
    local laws are so important, is not just to create
    the comfort zone for the members of Congress, but
    the process that you go through when you work in a
    coalition on such a bill is key in terms of
    changing attitudes, which is ultimately what we
   need.  A law cannot change people's thoughts.  <p>
              I know that when I worked on the
   Americans with Disabilities Act, I knew nothing
   about disability, really, before I started.  I knew
   stuff about AIDS, that's how I came to it.  But it
   was working on the ADA for two years, where I met
   people with disabilities, that opened my eyes to
   the range of issues affecting disabilities.  The
   same happens when you work in coalition on gay and
   lesbian issues.  I've seen it happen in the last
   three years in Washington.  It absolutely happens
   in every area where there is such a coalition
   effort.  And I believe that the ACLU is a key group
   for, in fact, helping to make those coalitions
   happen on the state and local level.      <p>
              And the third thing, is as you are
  working on the state and local level, the ACLU has
    a great structure for feeding you in toward the
    federal level in terms of phone calls, et cetera.
    But that really is not as important, in my mind, as
    the fact of having the efforts on the state and
    local level.         <p>
               I do believe that ENDA will pass.  And I
    used to be not sure if it would pass in my
    lifetime.  I am positive it will pass in my
   lifetime, and I'm not planning on killing myself,
   so...       <p>
              But the hard part will be whether all
   the other laws that affect public accommodations
   and housing, et cetera, when those will come.  That
   is the good news, I believe the best of times in
   terms of civil rights protections. <p>
              I believe that in terms of the efforts
   in the courts, the one area where it is going
   through the courts at the moment is in the
   military.  That is, in terms of discrimination by
   public employers, which is where constitutional
   challenges could arise, the main discrimination
   occurs in the military, those are the cases that
   are coming to the courts.  We have traditionally
   lost in those areas.  We are no longer consistently
    losing.  In fact, we are wining now as many cases
    as we are losing and many of those cases are
    brought by the ACLU Lesbian and Gay Rights
    Project.            <p>
               [ APPLAUSE ].     <p>
               Let me finally say that besides the
    America Online access -- which I think is
    excellent, in terms of you being able to get input
    here -- you should know that Matt Coles has a book
   coming out by the New Press, specifically on
   working on state and local initiatives, civil
   rights laws.  It's called "Try This At Home."  And
   in terms of general law, Bill Rubinstein, Matt
   Coles' predecessor at the project, has written a
   book called Lesbians, Gay Men And The Law, which is
   a great sourcebook, and I'm sure you can get
   information about that.            <p>
              There really is a lot that we can do.  I
   believe that this is the moment in history, and
   that we are seeing history being made as we live. <p>
              Thank you.                <p>
              [ APPLAUSE ].     <p>
              MR. STODDARD:  Good afternoon.  It's a
   pleasure, a great pleasure to be here among my
   friends and family.           <p>
               Ira Glasser, yesterday morning, invited
    us to take the long view in this year of our 75th
    anniversary, and he was certainly right about
    that.  If the long view is appropriate and helpful
    for us to take as civil libertarians, it is
    especially appropriate and especially moving to
    think about the long view in connection with this
    particular set of issues.  75 years ago there was
    no lesbian and gay rights movement.  There was
   maybe a twinkle in the eyes of a few dozen men and
   women, but that was it.                        <p>
              The modern day lesbian and gay civil
   rights movement is only 6 years old, if one uses
   Stonewall as the marker.  And the advances are,
   frankly, stunning, absolutely stunning, as Chai's
   introductory remarks have already suggested.  <p>
              The ACLU has also come a long way.  I'm
   going to deviate from what I'm supposed to be doing
   for just a moment to say something about that.  But
   if a gay person can't deviate, who can.             <p>
              [ LAUGHTER ].    <p>
              This morning I went into my historical
   file and I found a letter sent by an unnamed
   employee of the American Civil Liberties Union in
   957 to the public relations director of the
    Mattachine Society, which at the time was the most
    visible gay rights organization, dated November
    9th, 957.  It reads as follows.  It's quite
    short.  "Thank you for your letter of November
    st.  We are glad to learn of your interests in
    the Union's work and activity.  While we appreciate
    your kind invitation to address your group, we must
    deline.  The civil liberties aspects of the
    question of sexual deviation is so small that we do
   not devote major attention to this issue.  None of
   our staff is expert in this question and could
   hardly offer your group the kind of intensive
   discussion it would desire and deserves.  The
   meeting might very well begin with a general
   discussion of civil liberties, but the main
   interest of your organization would, in our
   opinion, veer into your special field" -- I love to
   veer -- "where we lack the competency to
   intelligently discuss the issue."               <p>
              Ira Glasser would never write that
   letter.                            <p>
              [ APPLAUSE ].   <p>
              AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Who did?  <p>
              MR. STODDARD:  The ACLU has come a long
   way and we should all take great pride in the
   extraordinary, precedent-setting work of the AIDS
    Project and the Gay and Lesbian Civil Rights
    Project.  This organization is one of the two or
    three leading groups in the country, perhaps even
    the world, on these subjects.  And I, as a civil
    libertarian, am very proud of that.     <p>
               Okay, now I'll do what I'm supposed to
    do.  I'm supposed to talk about family issues.     <p>
               In the seventies, as the modern day
   lesbian civil rights movement was trying to define
   its priorities and begin its work, issues tended to
   be centered on the rights of the individual as an
   individual, which was of course not universal, but
   the emphasis tended to be different, perhaps
   because the movement in those days was especially
   dominated by men.  Issues tended to be civil rights
   protections, generally, statutes analogous to the
   civil rights act of 964, for example, and the
   repeal of sodomy statutes.    <p>
              In the eighties and into the nineties
   the priorities established in the seventies
   shifted, changed in large, moved on to include
   family and lesbians and gay men in the context of
   family.  It's those issues that I'm going to talk
   about for just a moment.  <p>
             Over the past 0 years the lesbian and
    gay rights movement has come to embrace the concept
    of individuals in the general context of their
    families.  Individuals as parents, as children, as
    spousees, as households.  And now there is a
    flowering of work to establish the rights of
    lesbians and gay men, and all people in this
    country -- because, of course, this movement is
    ultimately about the rights of all people -- to be
   part of their own chosen context, to be part of the
   loving and concerned networks in which we all
   operate.             <p>
              I can see at least six different
   categories in which this work proceeds, and this
   is, I think, the most challenging and the most
   difficult of the work into the future.  <p>
              No. 1, marriage, something I'm
   particularly obsessed with.  I'm sorry I'm not here
   to introduce my spouse.  The personal is the
   political, after all.   <p>
              The Supreme Court of Hawaii ruled, two
   years ago, that the denial of a license to two
   women or two men to get married, is presumptively
   violative of the Hawaiian state constitution.  The
   court ruled on the basis of the state's equal
    rights amendment, the gender discrimination portion
    of the state constitution.  The argument being a
    very simple, and I think compelling one, that the
    state should not be able to say to a woman that she
    can only marry a man and not marry a woman, even
    though their relationship has all of the other
    aspects of the close and loving relationship we
    associate with spouses.<p>
               This is a startling and scary
   development.  This is the first court to make such
   a ruling.  The ruling will probably be, to a
   subsequent ruling by the Hawaii Supreme Court,
   stating that the denial of a marriage license to
   two women or two men definitively violates the
  Hawaii State Constitution and therefore, same sex
   couples may, for the first time -- not only in the
   United States, but in the world -- get a marriage
   license.     <p>
              That may sound like a small thing.
   Hawaii is a small state and a distant state,
   although a very wonderful state --      <p>
              [ LAUGHTER ].  <p>
               -- and a state that many people would
   like to visit for all sorts of reasons.  How
   convenient.   <p>
               But here is the legal catch:  In
    general, states are supposed to give regard to the
    legal act of their brother and sister states.  What
    happens if two men get a marriage license in
    Hawaii, then happen to move to Utah, for example, a
    state that comes to mind, and wish to receive the
    recognition for their marriage that traditionally
    Utah gives to marriages from New York or Florida or
    Washington State or anywhere else.  That will
   happen, and it will happen not only in Utah but in
   every state.  Lesbians and gay men will go to
   Hawaii to seek a marriage license.  I don't know
   the residency requirements of Hawaii, but some
   certainly will be able to qualify in some fashion,
   then they'll go back and seek recognition elsewhere
   for personal reasons and also for political
   reasons.   <p>
              And what will happen?  Well, I don't
   know.  This is an issue that the far right will
   really love, really love.  And it will be, it will
   be something that all of you as activists and civil
   libertarians will have to face in some fashion in
   your states.   <p>
              Utah -- actually, I lied a little bit, I
   didn't just choose Utah at random -- the Utah state
     legislature, in anticipation of this development,
    voted just a few weeks ago to declare that marriage
    is a heterosexual institution in Utah and that same
    sex couples, in essence, cannot enter into a
    marriage, as a statement of public policy.      <p>
               The phrase "public policy" is critical
    here, because under the laws of every state,
    although a state is required to give general legal
    effect under the full faith and credit clause of
   the Constitution, to what other states do there is
   an exception for violation of public policy.  And
   if legislatures across the country express their
   view that the public policy of Utah or Idaho
   requires heterosexual marriage to be limited to
   heterosexuals, you've got a problem.  And I don't
   know exactly what's going to happen, but I suspect
   we're going to see referenda and initiatives that
   are more dangerous politically, as well as
   frightening legally, than we've seen with regard to
   civil rights statutes.  This is an issue the far
   right loves. <p>
              There's an irony that should be added as
   a footnote.  There is a certain paradox on the
   issue of marriage.  To the far right, the radical
   right -- I have to remember to keep using the right
     phrases -- to the radical right marriage seems to
    be the most radical and dangerous proposition
    offered up by the lesbian and gay rights movement,
    because in their minds it seems to threaten their
    traditional ideas of family and spouses.        <p>
               Within the gay rights movement the view
    is very much different from that, as you might
    imagine, but in a way that you might not be fully
    aware of.  Many lesbians and gay men say:  "Look,
   marriage has been oppressive, especially not
   tolerant to women.  And the gay rights movement
   should not be seeking to spread out the oppression,
   to share the oppression with new couples."  So what
   is, what seems very radical and dangerous to the
   radical right, people outside of the movement, on
   the other side of it don't like it; seems
   conservative and dangerously traditional to people
   within the lesbian and gay rights movement.  And
   there is a little bit of truth on all sides of this
   I suspect.         <p>
              Okay, there's marriage, that's the
   issue, the large issue looming in the future that
   will be used as an organizing tactic by the radical
   right.                <p>
              No. 2 , domestic partnership.  As an
     alternative to traditional spousal recognition,
    activists throughout the country, some lesbians and
    gays, some not, have offered a new legal form
    called domestic partnership, which is a legal
    species by which a same sex couple or a
    heterosexual couple may register with a
    governmental agency, declaring that they have a
    close and loving relationship, leaving open the
    question of what flows from that.  Many cities
   around the country have now adopted some form of
   domestic partnership, including Los Angeles, San
   Francisco, Seattle, New York, Washington, D.C..
   Here's the problem, though, from a legal
   perspective:  By and large, cities do not have
   jurisdiction over family law and what they do
   doesn't matter very much.       <p>
              What the cities have done is therefore
   almost entirely symbolic, except with regard to the
   employment opportunities and benefits offered by
   the government as employer itself.  But I'll tell
   you, as a domestic partnership, or as a domestic
   partner, I find this legal species, even though
   very limited in effect and mostly symbolic,
   extremely useful.  For example, my spouse's law
   firm just decided to open up the group health plan
     to domestic partners, because the species had been
    created by the City of New York and seemed to have
    a certain legitimacy.  They didn't need to worry
    about fraud, as they might have otherwise, or
   issues of proof.  So domestic partnership can be
    quite valuable.  That's the second new development
    and that will continue to bubble up, particularly
    in the state legislatures.<p>
               The third issue, economic benefits.
   Marriage is desirable for many people because of
   the whole network of benefits that attach to
   spousal relationship.  And some claims have been
   made throughout the country, over the past five
   years, that the state and government in general is
   required to give economic benefits to same sex
   couples, or to domestic partners.  Those claims
   have, by and large failed, but there has been
   enormous progress on this issue through day-to-day,
   nonlegal activism within corporations.  It's a
   reminder to those of us who are lawyers, that
   lawyers aren't the only people who make change.
   It's especially important to remember that within
   the ACLU, I think.                        <p>
              Hundreds of corporations in the United
   States now extend benefits, economic benefits from
    group health care to bereavement leave to same sex
    couples or to domestic partners.  And they've done
    it simply by making economic arguments to
    employers, saying, among other things, it will be
    hard to recruit and get really good candidates of
    all kinds into a particular law firm if there is no
    recognition of these special relationships.  That's
    No. 3, mostly a nonlegal development.         <p>
               No. 4 has to be disputes.  Here is an
   example of where the long view gives us a sense of
   hope.  Approximately half of the states in the
   United States have judicial decisions that stand
   for the proposition that a woman or man may not be
   denied custody rights simply because of his or her
   sexual orientation.         <p>
              When you consider that 30 years ago,
   women in particular who were identified as lesbians
   were routinely denied their parental rights this is
   an extraordinary development.  The argument 30
   years ago was that a lesbian mother, was at the
   very least an unapprehended felon.  Someone who
   wanted to violate the sodomy statutes even if she
   hadn't been convicted.  Those are arguments in at
   least half the states, and in the states that are
   most populous, it can no longer be made.  That's a
    very significant development.  And the Bottoms
    case, of which you probably read in the ACLU
    newsletter, in Virginia, will, I think, ultimately
    be overturned, even in the state of Virginia,
    because the trend is wildly against that idea.   <p>
               No. 5, adoption, foster care.  Very
    quickly, two states specifically prohibit lesbians
    and gay men from serving as adoptive parents,
    Florida, thanks to Anita Bryant, and New Hampshire,
   thanks to Michael Dukakis.  I won't go into the
   long explanation of why Dukakis is connected to the
   developments in New Hampshire, but those two states
   statutorily prohibit lesbians and gay men from
   serving as adoptive parents.  This issue also
   arises in foster care.  The state of Nebraska
   recently adopted a regulation that prohibits the
   state from recommending foster care for a lesbian
   or gay man or lesbian or gay couple.                               <p>
              The Supreme Court of Florida recently
   side stepped the issue of whether the exclusion is
   unconstitutional, but this will be an ACLU issue
   for the future as well, especially as the far right
   moves on the family issues.       <p>
              Lastly, a very interesting new legal
   development of which some of you may not be aware,
    second-parent adoptions.  Traditionally under
    adoption law, when an adoption takes place, the
    natural -- the original parents' parental rights
    are severed.  That is to say, when an adoption
    takes place there can't be an adding onto a
    previous parental relationship.  There has to be
    only one parent or one parental connection.      <p>
               Lesbians and gay men have asserted that
    this is improper and disserves the interest of
   children, and have created a new idea, which is to
   say adding on a second parent's adoptive rights for
   the benefit of the child as well as the parents,
   and states -- courts in a number of states have
   accepted that idea, including two high courts.  The
   high court of New York, which is called the Court
   of Appeals, is about to consider this question
   itself and I'm afraid they may go in the wrong
   direction, believing that adoption under existing
   state statute requires a severing of the previous
   adoptive relationship.  But in the end this trend,
   too, is very vocal.  And it means, in connection
   with all of the other developments I've talked
   about very briefly, that lesbians and gay men will
   be entitled to the full and rich family life that
   all Americans deserve.   <p>
           Thank you.               <p>
               MR. COLES:  Tom and Chai are both
    members of the National Board, which is, I think
    another symbol of how far along this organization
    has come.  Since they're members of the National
    Board, they got to tell you about good things we
    see on the horizon.  Since I work for the national
    staff, I got assigned to tell you about some of the
    bad things that we see on the horizon.   <p>
              I'm going to talk quickly about three
   general areas of things that I think you might see
   happening at the affiliates and give you a couple
   of quick ideas about things that I think that you
   can do about them.<p>
              And the first area is anti-gay ballot
   initiatives.  And I think the specific nature of
   what we're going to see over the next five years is
   going to somewhat depend on what happens in the
   Colorado Amendment  case.  I'm sure everyone here
   knows what Colorado's Amendment  is.  It was an
   amendment to the state constitution that deprived
   every form of government in Colorado from ever
   passing any kind of law that would protect
   lesbians, gay men and bisexuals from any form of
   discrimination.  That law was challenged.  The
    challenge is now in the U.S. Supreme Court, which
    will probably hear arguments sometime in October.
    They will probably decide the case, I think, early
    next year.                            <p>
               If we lose that case, and I think we
    could lose that case, I think it's a fair
    assumption that we will see replications of
    Amendment  in virtually every state that has
    initiative and referendum.  We'll see virtually,
   the effects of the Colorado initiative brought back
   again.                                   <p>
              If we win that case, I think we will
   still see initiatives, maybe not as widely.
   They'll be a little bit different.  They'll be
   designed, I think to try and get past the
   Colorado -- the Supreme Court case, if we win it.
   One form which we've actually already seen crop up
   in a few places.  It's an initiative which just
   says:  The state can pass civil rights laws to
   cover these groups and no others, and then lists a
   group of people who can be protected, and low and
   behold, lesbians, gay men and bisexuals are not on
   the list of people who can be protected.  The
   discrimination is taken off the face of the
   initiative.  They're much harder to challenge
    legally.  It would present a different set of legal
    issues than the Colorado issue.   <p>
               The other thing that I think we may see
    is some of the same issues that Tom was talking
    about, issues about marriage, adoption, foster
    parenting and custody put on the ballot in public
    initiatives, and I think these will generate some
    very tough election campaigns.  I'll talk
    specifically about some of the kinds of devices we
   may see in a minute, but first I want to suggest
   what you can do if you see the potential for an
   anti-gay initiative on the ballot coming down the
   pike.      <p>
              And the first thing to do, and I can't
   emphasize this enough, is to find out what all your
   state or local rules on initiatives and referendums
   are.  They are very complicated.  They differ from
   state to state.  But find out how many signatures
   people need, find out when they have to go in, find
   out what the process for title and summary are,
   find out what kind of challenges are possible.  You
   need to know all that stuff to be able to get
   yourselves armed to figure out what an intelligent
   response to a potential anti-gay ballot initiative
   is.<p>
            And then when you've got yourself armed
    with that, think about the following potential
    tactics.  Think about running an anti-qualification
    campaign, a campaign to try and keep the initiative
    from qualifying for the ballot.  There are a number
    of states and localities where the signature
    requirements are quite high.  In cities in North
    Carolina you've got to get 5 percent of the
    registered voters.  It's very possible to beat
   these things in places where the signature
   requirements are quite high.  And even where
   they're not referendums, an initiative was
   successfully kept off the ballot in Arizona last
   year, I think partly because the Republican party
   thought it would be a bad idea to have another --       <p>
              AUDIENCE MEMBER: They never submitted
   any signatures, because they never got any, zero.  <p>
             MR. COLES:  Well, in any event, I know
   they didn't submit signatures at the end of the
   campaign.  I realize that.  I know that.<p>
              AUDIENCE MEMBER:  They never gathered
   any, either.     <p>
              MR. COLES:  Well, that's news to me,
   they never gathered any, but, okay.   <p>
              AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Right.   <p>
                MR. COLES:  In any event, you can run an
    anti-qualification campaign.  There are a series of
    different ways to do that.  You can run various
    sorts of preelection challenges, especially that
    are keyed into those technical requirements of what
    you need in an initiative.  It's very important, if
    you do that, to be in touch with the political
    people.  How a campaign goes on an initiative, you
    can make a difference in 5 or 6 percent of the
   vote, depending on the way the question is stated
   on the ballot.  And you can very often challenge
   the ballot questions when they are originally
   formulated.  And of course, you can run a campaign
   against the initiative itself.  These things are
   winnable.  If you don't believe me, ask Jack
   Van Valkenburgh from the Idaho affiliate of the
   ACLU.  In a year of a Republican sweep --    <p>
              [ APPLAUSE ].             <p>
               -- an anti gay initiative got beaten  
   in Idaho.  These things are winnable in a political
   campaign.  And the project has put out a briefing
   book that reviews the Colorado experience and makes
   a series of what I think are helpful suggestions
   that we did pass on to the folks in Idaho.  If
   you're looking at this, we can help you with that
  as well.                                <p>
               And finally, don't assume just because
    we've loss the Colorado case, if we have loss it,
    that court challenges post amendment are
    impossible.  Depending on the way the state's law
    works on amendments -- again, thinking of Idaho --
    it may well be possible to bring various kinds of
    post election state law challenges.  So don't think
    any doors are necessarily closed.  <p>
              Secondary, where I think you may see
   things over the next couple years is, somewhat as
   Tom gave you a hint of, in the area of marriage and
   family law.  And I think there are three types of
   things that we'll see.  We'll see anti gay marriage
   legislation, laws saying affirmatively that
   lesbians and gay men cannot get married in a given
   state.  We may see laws prohibiting adoption or
   foster parenting or regulations designed to the
   same effect.  And we may see laws forbidding second
   parent adoptions, that Tom was talking about a
   second ago.     <p>
              Litigation in these areas is difficult,
   very difficult.  These kinds of laws and
   regulations are very, very difficult to challenge
   in court, but never dismiss them out of hand.  If
    you've got one coming up, call us at the project
    and talk to us about it.  Because the way some of
    them have been crafted, because of the way state
    law works in various states, some of them can be
    challenged with litigation.  But you should never
    think of litigation as the first course and,
    indeed, once again there are a number of success
    stories on policies like these that have been
    stopped.   <p>
              The grassroots policy that Tom was
   talking about actually hasn't gone, hasn't taken
   final effect as a rule in Nebraska yet.  And while
   it's not clear to me that it will be stopped, it's
   been slowed down considerably, I think by a very,
   very good combination of providing the state social
   services agency with information that most of the
   assumptions they were basing the policy on were
   wrong.  We provided them a couple of powerful
   examples of why this was not a good idea.  And by
   convincing a number of moderate political people in
  the state that it would be good to oppose it.  And
  at least, I think the jury is still out on how
   Nebraska is going to turn out at this point.  But
   it is possible -- it has been slowed down.  It may
   be stopped.  <p>
         South Dakota also comes to mind.  South
  Dakota, like Utah, had a proposal in the
   legislature to ban lesbian/gay marriage and partly
   with the help of Dorothy Davidson in the Mountain
   States Regional Office, that got defeated.  Now, it
   got defeated with an argument that won't work for
   us forever, because one of the main arguments
   against it was, it's completely unnecessary, people
   already can't get married in South Dakota.  And it
   could prove to be very expensive if challenged.
  Once the Hawaii case comes along, it may be tougher
  to use that argument.  But again, South Dakota
   seemed to me to be an unlikely place to stop that
   under any circumstances.  And it is possible to
   stop them.<p>
              The third area in which I think you may
   see things, and this is a very general area:  I
   think as we see increasing visibility of lesbians
   and gay men and increasing visibility of the
   lesbian and gay movement, we're going to see
  increasing discrimination and we're going to see it
  all across the board.  I think we're going to see
   increasing employment discrimination, we're going
   to see increasing discrimination in housing.  We'll
   see attempts to stop lesbian and gay parades from
    going forward.  We'll see attacks on anti
  discrimination laws where they get passed.  <p>
             What you can do about these things is
  pretty obvious.  But I want to point out two areas
  in which I think there are some things that I think
  you can do that are not completely obvious.  And
  the first thing is this:  If you have a
   discrimination case in a state where you don't have
    a nondiscrimination law, unlike Rhode Island and
   the eight other states, and you don't have
   governmental actors, so that you can bring a
   constitutional claim, don't assume that all is
   necessarily lost.  It may well be necessarily lost,
   but don't assume it.  In various circumstances
   there are some creative things you can do.  If you
   get a case like that cropping up, please call us at
   the project at the national office, we'll take a
   look at it and see if we can think of a way to
   approach it anyway. <p>
              Don't automatically assume that all is
  lost in a nondiscrimination case.   <p>
             And second, particularly if you see
   cases that involve things like parades and
   demonstrations, or more particularly, instances of
   people suffering discrimination because they are
   out of the closet or open, and work for
   governments, let me just pass on to you a word
   about what I am beginning to call regularly, the
   great silver lining case of the last 0 years, and
   that is the Boston parade case. <p>
              There are two things in the Boston
   parade case in this general area that I think
   everyone ought to know.  The first thing, and the
   less important one, but still very significant is,
   the Supreme Court went out of its way in the Boston
  parade case to say that the states and the cities
  have the power under the federal constitution to
   pass anti-discrimination laws that protect lesbians
  and gay men from discrimination.  <p>
              Now, that issue wasn't really in front
   of the Court.  So in some sense it's not, you know,
   the greatest bit of holding that you've ever seen.
   On the other hand, it's pretty strong language from
  the Court and I think if you're in a place where
   you have a local non-discrimination law or a state
  non-discrimination law and you have to defend it,
  this is a powerful tool for defending it that
   people shouldn't overlook.  But even more important
   in that case, the Court said, look:  The gay Irish
   contingent in that parade, by marching behind a
  banner that identified the folks in the parade as
  lesbian and gay, was making a political statement.
 It was making a statement that there are lesbians
  and gay men in the Irish community and that they
 are entitled to equal respect as members of that
  community. <p>
              I think -- now, that's a step short of
   saying that being out of the closet on the job or
   coming out of the closet on the job, if you work
 for a governmental employer, is protected political
  speech, but it comes, I think, very close.  And it
  gives us the powerful tools we need to put together
  that kind of an argument.  So if you've got a case
 that involves people being out and suffering any
   kind of retaliation from the government, think
   about the Boston parade case.  I think it's a
   powerful new tool for us. <p>
              And finally, let me repeat my broken
   record at the biennial, which I've been alluding to
   so far, which is this:  We've got a very able staff
   at the National Lesbian/Gay Rights Project.  Mark
   Elovitz and Ruth Harlow are right at the table up
   here.    <p>
              [ APPLAUSE ].<p>
              The project's been around almost 10
  years.  We've got a lot of experience.  If you've
    got a lesbian or gay issue coming up in your
    affiliate, call us right away.  We can save you a
    lot of time.  We can be very helpful in telling you
    whether there's something to do about this, framing
    how to go forward on it and putting you in touch
    with resources.  Please get in touch with us right
    away.   <p>
               The bottom line is, I think there's
   going to be a lot of action in lesbian and gay
   rights in the next five years.  It's going to be
   the kind of action that takes foresight and
   planning to succeed with, especially the stuff that
   doesn't lend itself well to litigation.  And
   they're going to be tough.  These are going to be
  tough political issues, they're going to be tough
   electoral issues and they're going to be tough
   litigation issues.   <p>
              But tough issues, when it's the right
   thing to do, I mean we're the ACLU, that's what we
   do, right?  <p>
              [ APPLAUSE ].    <p>
              MS. VAID:  Hi, my name is Urvashi Vaid.
   And I'm going to -- I'm playing cleanup hitter
   here.  My job is to talk some about the nonlegal
   opportunities that exist for us to organize and
    fight back against the kind of landscape that Matt
    described.  But before I do that, I want to do my
    presentation in two ways:  Suggest to you a
    conceptual shift that I think is confronting the
    gay movement in particular, and it's confronting
    the progressive movement generally, and then talk
    very practically about some of the work that I
    think affiliates can do.<p>
              In the high-tech world of computers, the
   simulation of events and situations produced from
   computer and video technology is called virtual
   reality, right?  It's most commonly used to train
   airline pilots in flight simulation and by the
   Defense Department to play war games.  Virtual
   reality has, until now, been mostly the fascination
   of cyber junkies like me.  I am one.  I'm coming
   out.      <p>
              [ LAUGHTER ].         <p>
              You didn't know that.   <p>
              The technology of this virtual reality
   should probably be as common as headphones or, you
   know, Sony Walkmans and all that stuff.     <p>
              Well, I think that metaphor aptly
   describes in some way the status of gay people,
  only I call it virtual equality.  The irony of
  gay/lesbian progress is that nearly more than 50
   years of activism -- I do include the Mattachine
    movement as part of the modern movement -- more
    than 50 years of organizing and challenging
    homophobia and sexism has yielded us not freedom,
    but virtual equality.  Virtual equality simulates
    genuine equality, but cannot transcend the
    simulation.      <p>
              In this state gay and lesbian people
   possess some of the trappings of full equality, but
   are denied its full benefits.  We proceed as if we
   enjoy real freedom, real acceptance, as if we've
   won lasting changes to the laws of our nation.  And
  some of us even believe that the simulation of
   equality we have won represents the real thing.
   But the real facts of discrimination, the
   conditions which define gay and lesbian life,
   demonstrate that we have won virtual freedom,
   virtual equal treatment under virtually the same
   laws as straight people.   <p>
              I think that, as Chai pointed out at the
   outset, we're at a contradictory juncture.  On the
   one level our movement has been a staggering, yet
   still controversial success.  And yet we remain
 profoundly stigmatized and still struggling against
   the same crisis that gay and lesbian people have
    faced for the last hundreds of years.  We're still
    struggling against violence, against
    discrimination, against the denial of social
    services by government, in health care access, in
    education.  We're still struggling against
    invisibility within our communities, we're still
    struggling against the prejudice of our families,
   against the ostracism of religion and against the
   prejudice in the workplace.     <p>
              Indeed, a vast majority of our people
   still remain closeted, still remain unwilling to
   acknowledge their sexual orientation.       <p>
              I guess I'm the bummer.  I told you I
   was going to be a bit of a bummer.   <p>
              Gay and lesbian participation in the
   cultural, commercial, political, religious and
   civic leaders of our society is, indeed evident
   everywhere.  But in the eyes of so many of our
   straight peers, gay people are still seen as
   immoral, unnatural, and unhealthy.  Now, perhaps
   this state of affairs is merely the inevitable
   consequence of civil rights progress.  As any
   movement succeeds, vestiges of the old ways
  persist. <p>
              Like the other civil rights movements
   which preceded us, and on which we have consciously
   modeled our goals and strategies, I think the gay
    movement has reached a moment of partial
    fulfillment.  The system has adapted to our
    existence, but it still has not changed in
    fundamental ways and nor have we changed it in
    fundamental ways.  We are freer than we were in the
   forties and sixties, the seventies and eighties,
   but we still have failed to realize true
   recognition as moral, healthy, natural, normal
   human beings, which I think is the goal of our
   movement.  At least I claim it as that.  <p>
              The modern black civil rights movement,
   I think began to face a similar dilemma in the
   early sixties soon after the passage of major
   federal civil rights legislation, like the Civil
   Rights Act of 964 and the Voting Rights Act the
   next year.  Laws were changed, people's lives
   improved, but the economic condition of large
   numbers of African Americans remained the same and
   even deteriorated over the next 30 years.  Racial
   prejudice remained in place, even as its age old
  legal operation was dismantled.   <p>
           The women's liberation movement faced
    this moment in the late seventies as its national
    leadership targeted the ERA.  By the mid eighties
    the effort to pass the ERA had failed, the radical
    grassroots women's movement was splintered into
    warring single-issue factions and the term post
    feminism was more popular than feminist.
    Gender-based discrimination, sexism and violence
    persisted, even as women's participation in all
  aspects of cultural life increased. <p>
              I think today the gay and lesbian, our
   sexual transgender movement is in the middle of a
   similarly decisive moment.  And we can choose in
   this moment to follow the path our predecessors
   have paved of pursuing incremental legal and
   legislative reform, of increasing gay visibility,
   of pressing for fair treatment.  I mean, and I
   think we must continue along this path.  But I want
   to suggest that we have to do more.  And I think
  what we have to do more -- what we have to do is
   reach beyond the civil rights framework of
   mainstream integration, beyond the partial equality
   it delivers and imagine -- and reconnect ourselves
   to the different framework, which is:  Genuine
   social change or liberation.<p>
            I think at this contradictory juncture
   it behooves us to re-examine long held assumptions
   about our politics, our identities, our strategies
    and our social agenda and to define a new and
    broader moral vision as a gay and lesbian
    movement.  In other words, instead of asking the
    question that we have chanted for 50 years, "What
    do we want and when do we want it?"  And answering,
    "Gay rights now."  <p>
              I suggest the time has come for us to
   ask and answer:  What do we represent as gay
   people?  For what vision of society do we fight?
   How does a freedom-based movement differ from a
   rights-based movement and what will it mean for us,
   for our nation and for the world to accept
   homosexuality as morally, politically and socially
   equal to heterosexuality?     <p>
              That's a far more threatening question.
   Indeed, that's the question that our enemies ask.
   That's the truth on which they wage the debate, is
   they say we represent a true danger.  And we say,
   oh, no, we're just like you.<p>
              It doesn't work.  We don't respond to
   their argument.    <p>
              So answering these questions, I think
    requires us to examine the whole idea of
    mainstreaming.  Now, I think that the military
   experience of '93 and '94 revealed the inadequacy
   of our mainstreaming.  In that political loss, even
   though it was a cultural win, because the
    conversation about homosexuality took place at the
    kitchen tables of every -- practically every home,
    because we were in the news every day.  So in that
    sense it's a cultural victory, to be talking about
   homosexuality.  But it was undeniably a political
   loss.  In that political loss our movement learned
   that we had neither overcome the negative cultural
   images of homosexuality held by so many, nor had we
   created a powerful movement that could exert its
   muscle in a major domestic policy battle.  <p>
              Please feel free to disagree.     <p>
              Many of us viewed -- I mean, you're not
   shocked, we've had this argument before.  We've had
   this conversation before.  <p>
              Many of us viewed the fight to lift the
  ban as a logical step in our civil rights
  strategy.  Yet despite the years of groundwork by
   gay and lesbian veterans and many of you who have
   brought lawsuits to challenge the policy, despite
   the political work of people like Tom and Chai and
 activism in the military -- you know, the Campaign
    for Military Service, and despite the huge
    visibility of the issue in the '92 campaign or the
    '93 March on Washington, we ran up against the
    most abject stereotypes of gay men and lesbians.
    You know, when soldiers begin talking about showers
    and foxholes, whatever mainstream legitimacy we had
    assumed, whatever straight tolerance we thought we
    had earned vanished.  <p>
              Arguing this undeniably square issue in
   the language of fairness and civil rights, we were
   brought face-to-face with our essential queerness,
   that which is the most marginalized about us still,
   our sexualities.   <p>
              Indeed, the military fight resulted in
   the reaffirmation, not only of the ban on gay
   people in the military, but it added new
   restrictions to anti-gay codes, which will be, I
   think, declared unconstitutional but -- I mean,
   they have been, but -- and I think that -- I hope,
  I pray they will be upheld.      <p>
              Today someone can be kicked out not just
   for being gay or engaging in gay/lesbian sex, but
   for acting gay, declaring they are gay or for being
   perceived to have done so.  So I think we should
   question whether -- in a conceptual sense --
    whether the civil rights paradigm alone is the best
    vehicle to win genuine gay/lesbian freedom.       <p>
               Now, given this audience, I appreciate
    the heresy of what I am proposing, okay?  So don't
    get me wrong.  I am not arguing that we must
    abandon civil rights.  I am arguing that we must
    supplement it.  Absolutely, we cannot abandon the
    work that we have been doing, it is just beginning
   to incrementally succeed.  But I do not believe
  that that civil rights strategy on its own or the
  strategy of political and legislative mainstreaming
   on its own will result in what I think our goals
   should be, which is the true equality of lesbian
   and gay people in every aspect of life. <p>
              This tension between civil rights
   strategy and social change strategies is an old one
   in the queer movement.  I mean, it's old.  It goes
   back; it goes back.  And it's still going on.  So
   I'm just weighing in in its modern day version.        <p>
             That's the general, conceptual
  paradigmatic shift that I think we ought to
   consider and debate.  Unlike gay rights alone,
   liberation stands for a broader set of cultural
   values, like political freedom for all, social
  justice and the rebuilding of community among gay,
    straight and bisexual people.  The struggle against
    racism, it stands -- it incorporates the struggle
    against sexism.  Liberation challenges us to
    articulate different codes of ethics and morality
    and individual responsibility. <p>
               In some ways, what I think we have to do
    as a movement is move from the political much more
    into the cultural.  And that's where I think the
   affiliates and your work in the nonlegal,
  nonpolitical -- extra political, if you will --
  context can be so valuable. <p>
              I want to give you four specific ideas
   about it and then we're going to open it up to your
   questions and comments and reactions.   <p>
              I really value nonlegal work, because I
   guess I'm in some ways a frustrated lawyer.  I
   always identify as an ex-lawyer.  I mean, I made it
   through that whole process and I was proud to work
   at the National Prison Project with an incredible
  legal staff, but I've always enjoyed organizing.
  And organizing is my passion.  The idea of bringing
   people together around an issue, identifying the
   problem and trying to creatively solve the problem
   is organizing.            <p>
            And I think that the affiliates nonlegal
    work on gay and lesbian issues involves four
    things:  Education, organizing, advocacy and
    building power, okay?   <p>
               Education is pretty self-explanatory.
    But I want to reiterate the point that so many
    people within the gay and lesbian community, within
    the progressive communities, liberals as well as
    uninterested or ignorant bystanders, just don't
   understand what gay rights means.  What do we mean
  by "gay and lesbian equality"?  What do we mean by
  "non-discrimination laws"?  What prejudice, what
   violence?  <p>
              That's the kind of basic education we
   still need and each of you has a role you can play
   in that.  Every chapter, every affiliate can
   sponsor talks.  It's just that repetition is the
   only way we're going to get through, you know, and
   that kind of grassroots repetition about this is
   what is going on in our community, this is the kind
  of prejudice people are living with, or the lack of
  protections, and this is what it means in real
   people's lives, will make a tremendous difference.
   The polls show that people just don't know that or
   don't believe it, so that kind of a political
  education is really important. <p>
               Another kind of education that I know
   every affiliate does, is education of the media,
   and that is vitally important.  So we need you very
    much, all the executive directors of the
    affiliates, all the staff members, to speak out
    about gay and lesbian issues whenever you do any
    interviews.  Weave it in, come on, you can do it.
    Even if it's not directly on point, weave it in as
   an issue that the affiliate cares about, that the
  ACLU cares about.  It's a really important,
  practical thing that has an impact. <p>
              On the issue of organizing, I'm
   including coalition building in that organizing,
   and I think that that is one of the most important
   roles that a presumptively straight organization
   like the ACLU -- you know, I mean I'm just joking,
   of course --     <p>
              [ LAUGHTER ].  <p>
               -- that a non-gay identified
  organization like the American Civil Liberties
  Union can take an enormous leadership role.  And
   it's a role that's needed.  When Chai describes how
   recent the LCCR's commitment on lesbian and gay
   rights issues is -- I mean, 1992, we're at 1995 --
 you can see how new it is for non-gay allies to
    step forward and say:  Yeah, this is preposterous.
    You know, we oppose homophobic discrimination,
    period.  <p>
               And we need you to do that.  We need you
    to convene the coalitions.  Because it's one thing
    for me, as a lesbian, to call up all the nonprofit
    organizations in my community and say NAACP, labor,
    you know, women's rights organizations, come on
   over, we're going to get together and talk about
  how we can work together in Massachusetts, where I
  live.    <p>
              Because he's no friend, I'm sorry.  More
   on that in the question and answer period.   <p>
              [ LAUGHTER ].<p>
              I mean, I don't consider a guy who says
   he supports gay rights, but dismantles the rights
   of -- I mean, like destroys the welfare programs in
   the state, destroys education, privatizes
   everything, I don't consider him a champion of gay
  rights.<p>
             [ APPLAUSE ].       <p>
              And that's what I'm talking about, in
   terms of a shift in the way we look at our
   movement.  If what we're about is social change,
 these rights are indivisible, so that's -- I'll
    stop preaching.  <p>
               But the coalition building piece, the
    leadership role that you can play is invaluable.
    It means a lot -- it means something else for the
    Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts to convene
    such a meeting as I was describing.  And it carries
    so much clout, more clout to state legislators, to
    the state's media, and even to your members.  It's
   really important.       <p>
              The third area that I mentioned was
   advocacy.  Now, that is a directly legislative role
   that I really urge you to play more.  Every single
   state legislature has faced AIDS legislation, you
   know it, you've been dealing with it, and it's
   going to be facing more and more gay legislation,
   both pro-active and pro gay, as well as anti gay.
   And Matt's project is the absolute best resource
   you have within the agency to know how to respond
   to that kind of legislative effort.  But we also --
   I mean, just the basic kinds of stuff that you do,
   again, carry the gay and lesbian agenda in with you
   when you walk in to talk with legislators about
   anything, make sure it's included.  Talk about the
   positions -- the realities of gay people.
   Commission surveys to find out, if there's no data
    in the state.  Be a resource for the media and for
    state legislators.  Push politicians, we've got to
    do that at the state level. <p>
               Finally, the whole thing about power.
    June Jordan is a wonderful poet, says "There is
    difference and there is power, and who holds the
    power defines the meaning of the difference."
    Okay?  I'm interested in all of us, as progressive
   people, being much more straightforward about a
  movement for power.  In many ways that is going to
  require an electoral consciousness, if you will.
   We've got to register people to vote.  We've got to
   have, and see ourselves, our membership lists as a
   source of power.  And I'm not so sure that we have
   used those in that way.   <p>
              In every federal gay rights measure that
   I've worked on or seen my colleagues work on, we
   have not been able to generate grassroots support.
   Letters, phone calls, E-mail just haven't been
  flooding in from supporters of lesbian and gay
  rights.  Now, that happens at the same instance
   that we have the official support from
   organizations like the ACLU for these bills, like
   the NAACP, NOW and all these organizations.  There
  is somehow a disjunction between the organization
     support and it getting down to the level of members
    and our communication to those members to say write
    to the federal legislators or the state legislators
    in support of this measure.      <p>
               We've got to use our mailing lists and
    our memberships in a much more concerted way for
    political ends, and not be afraid of that.  What
    are we afraid of?  The Christian right does it all
   the time, their tax status doesn't suffer.  I don't
  know.     <p>
             But I just think the building of power
   is what progressives, frankly, have not been
   doing.  And to do that, I feel, requires a shift in
   all of our ways of thinking about our work.  We are
   an opposition movement.  This organization, in my
   view, represents an opposition to the politics that
   are in power in Washington today.  And I think we
   have to take our role much more consciously as
   leaders and organizers of that opposition.        <p>
             Thank you very much.    <p>
             [ APPLAUSE ]   <p>

Anti-Gay Marriage Bill and Employment Non-Discrimination </TITLE></HEAD>

<H2>ACLU Background Briefing:<BR>Congress Considers Anti-Gay Marriage Bill and
Employment Non-Discrimination Act</H2>
</CENTER>
<P> <B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>August 6, 1996</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>WASHINGTON -- Congress is currently considering legislation that would deny
Federal recognition of marriages between same-sex couples, and allow states to
ignore such marriages performed in any other state.  The American Civil
Liberties Union believes that the so-called Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is
unconstitutional and bad public policy.</P>
<P>DOMA was approved by the House on July 13, and is now pending action by the
full Senate, where an amendment barring workplace bias against lesbian and gay
Americans is likely to be attached when Congress returns from its August recess.
The amendment, known as the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), would
prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in all employment decisions,
such as hiring, termination and promotion.</P>
<P>ENDA addresses the serious problem of employment discrimination against gay
Americans.  Therefore, the ACLU is working to build support for the ENDA
amendment while vigorously continuing to oppose DOMA.  This background briefer
outlines both measures, and explains the ACLU's position in fuller detail.</P>
<H3>I.  THE ANTI-GAY PROPOSAL</H3>
<P>The only reason why the Defense of Marriage Act, S. 1740,  is being debated
now is election-year politics. The proposed legislation goes beyond legislators
saying they are not ready to accept same-sex marriages.  It is an unnecessary
and offensive attempt by anti-gay extremists in Congress to single out lesbian
and gay Americans to score political points.</P>
<P>The issue of gay marriages has arisen, in part, because of a ruling by the
Hawaii Supreme Court in May 1993 that denying marriage licenses to same-sex
couples may violate the state constitution's guarantee of equal protection.  But
a final ruling by the Hawaii courts is not expected for at least two years.  In
the meantime, no state currently recognizes marriages between gay Americans. 
Nonetheless, members of Congress are seeking to preempt such marriages before
any state permits them.</P>
<H3>The &quot;State Law&quot; Part of DOMA</H3>
<P>DOMA raises several serious constitutional and public policy concerns. The
first provision of the bill purports to allow states to ignore each other's
legal marriages.  Section 2 of the bill says:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian
tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial
proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a
relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under
the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or
claim arising from such relationship.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>DOMA Mocks &quot;Full Faith and Credit&quot;</H3>
<P>This provision of DOMA directly violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause of
the Constitution (Article IV, Section 1), which provides that the court
judgments of one state shall be recognized as valid in other states. The Clause
says:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Full Faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts,
records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.  And the Congress may by
general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records and proceedings
shall be proved, and the effect thereof.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Full Faith and Credit clause was designed to ensure that the United
States would operate as one nation, making sure states do not ignore the rights
and obligations imposed by sister states.  Congress has used its power to
enforce the Full Faith and Credit Clause on only four occasions -- and only when
it sought to promote, not diminish,  uniformity among the states.</P>
<P>The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently ruled that the Full Faith and Credit
Clause requires that each state  honor the court judgments of sister states.
Since the court has applied that rule in cases involving divorce, there can be
little question that DOMA violates Full Faith and Credit.</P>
<H3>DOMA Violates the Right To Travel</H3>
<P>The &quot;state law&quot; part of DOMA violates another cornerstone
principle of the Constitution: the right to travel, temporarily or permanently
from state to state.  By allowing states to ignore the legal marriages of
lesbian and gay couples, DOMA would create the absurd scenario of having a
couple's marital status depend on the state in which they happen to be at any
given moment.  It would force people who are transferred for work, or who want
to relocate near family, into the unfair position of having to choose between
their legal marriage and their career or family.  Similarly, DOMA would prevent
lesbian and gay couples from traveling through certain states if they want to
avoid the risk of being treated as strangers in an emergency or a crisis.</P>
<H3>The &quot;Federal Law&quot; Part of DOMA</H3>
<P>The second provision of the bill, Section 3, would define marriage for the
purposes of all federal laws and programs as a &quot;union between one man and
one woman.&quot; The provision states:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling,
regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies
of the United States, the word ?marriage' means only a legal union between one
man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word 'spouse' refers only to a
person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This would be the first time in U.S. history that the Federal government
adopted a definition of marriage of any kind.  Until now, the Federal government
has always accepted state definitions of marriage for Federal law. DOMA  would
have the effect of treating all lesbian and gay couples as strangers under
Federal laws, denying them such basic considerations as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>bereavement or sick leave to take care for a partner or a partner's child;</LI>
<LI>pension or social security continuation when a partner dies;</LI>
<LI>the ability to keep a jointly owned home if a partner goes on Medicaid,
dies, or becomes sick;</LI>
<LI>joint tax returns and exemptions for primary relationships on estate taxes;</LI>
<LI>veteran's discounts on medical care, education, and home loans;</LI>
<LI>immigration and residency for partners from other countries.</LI></UL>
<P>This would create an unworkable set of legal and logistical problems in
determining estates, taxes, securities, property, debt, and insurance -- in
fact, any area that takes marriage into account.</P>
<H3>DOMA Violates Equal Protection</H3>
<P>The entire bill (both the state law and the federal law sections) violates
the Fifth Amendment guarantee of equal protection.  DOMA creates second- class
status for legally married same-sex couples, denying them all the
responsibilities and respect other married couples enjoy, for no reason other
than hostility and disapproval.  There can be little doubt that under Romer v.
Evans -- the 1996 Supreme Court decision striking down Colorado's anti-gay
Amendment 2 -- DOMA is unconstitutional.</P>
<H3>DOMA is Unfair</H3>
<P>Civil marriage is the way our society defines committed emotional
relationship.  Accordingly, we attach a wealth of legal and economic
consequences to it, ranging from visitation rights and parenting
responsibilities, to joint taxes and insurance coverage.  It is also the device
our society uses to identify partners for virtually every practical situation --
whether it be at the hospital, in emergency situations, or the home -- in which
it is important to identify the person who is closest to you.</P>
<P>For example, if you were not legally married to your partner, you could lose
your home despite having lived in it with a partner for 30 years because of
insurance or inheritance problems.  If you were not married, you could be denied
the right to take care of a sick or dying partner in most hospitals.  And in
many cases, you could even lose your children because the government does not
recognize your relationship.</P>
<P>It is fundamentally unfair to say, on the one hand, that you must marry to
be treated as next of kin, and then to deny an entire class of Americans -- who
are, for all practical purposes, each other's next of kin -- the right to marry.</P>
<H3>DOMA is Anti-Relationship</H3>
<P>Marriage is a basic human right that should be available to all Americans.  
Making a commitment to a life-long relationship is a fundamental human need that
should not be denied to anyone.  If two gay people want to get married, and take
responsibility for each other for better or worse, in sickness and in health,
why should the government legislate against their commitment?</P>
<P>While marriage has traditionally been defined as a union between people of
different sexes, it was also traditionally defined as between people of the same
race.  As recently as 1967, more than a dozen states had laws barring
interracial couples from marrying.   Marriage was also traditionally understood
to transform a woman into the property of the man.  But as our society evolved,
those &quot;traditional&quot; elements of marriage changed to reflect our belief
that people should be free to choose their life partner without government
intrusion.</P>
<P>For more than 200 years, Congress has left it to the states to decide who
they will marry, and to the courts to make sure they respect each other's
decisions.  That is a fine tradition that ought to be respected.  The proposed
legislation, however, throws that tradition on the trash heap and belittles the
relationship of lesbian and gay men.</P>
<H3>DOMA Summary</H3>
<P>DOMA is bad constitutional law and bad public policy.  It is an unnecessary
and offensive bill that would violate several core principles of our
Constitution in addition to creating an unworkable patchwork of government rules
and regulations for marriage.  Apart from being an unmistakable violation of the
Constitution, it is a deplorable act of hostility unworthy of support.  The bill
does nothing to &quot;defend&quot; marriages; it only attacks lesbian and gay
Americans.</P>
<H3>II.  A PRO-GAY AMENDMENT</H3>
<P>Most Americans agree that no one should face job discrimination for reasons
unrelated to their performance and ability.  But lesbians and gay men continue
to face severe discrimination in the workplace.   Even worse, there is no
federal law, and only a handful of states laws, that prohibit an employer from
firing someone simply because he or she is gay.</P>
<P>The Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, would address this pressing
concern. Senators Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), and
James Jeffords (R-Vt.) intend to offer ENDA as an amendment to the anti-gay
marriage bill if it reaches the Senate floor.</P>
<P>The amendment would outlaw employment discrimination based on sexual
orientation, in much the same way that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, religion and gender.  The core
section of ENDA is found in Section 2:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A covered entity, in connection with employment or employment opportunities,
shall not --</P>
<P>(1) subject an individual to different standards or treatment on the basis
of sexual orientation;</P>
<P>(2) discriminate against an individual based on the sexual orientation of
persons with whom such an individual is believed to associate or to have
associated; or</P>
<P>(3) otherwise discriminate against an individual on the basis of sexual
orientation</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>ENDA is narrowly tailored to deal only with discrimination in employment
decisions, such as hiring, termination, promotion and compensation. While
extremists have sought to paint ENDA as an affirmative action policy for
lesbians and gay men, the proposed amendment explicitly prohibits preferential
treatment for gay workers. Furthermore, the amendment makes exemptions for the
military and religious organizations.</P>
<P>The definition of &quot;employers&quot; covered under ENDA is the same
definition of &quot;employer&quot; used in Title VII. Small businesses with
fewer than 15 employees are exempt.  Finally, the measure does not require
businesses to provide equal fringe benefits to the partners of lesbian and gay
workers (although hundreds of companies -- including half of the Fortune 500 --
have already done so voluntarily as a good business measure).</P>
<H3>ENDA Addresses Widespread Problem</H3>
<P>Workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation is prevalent throughout
the nation.  Many businesses continue to fire lesbian and gay employees without
apology, and some states even maintain policies that exclude gay people from
certain positions.  Every year, untold numbers of lesbian and gay Americans are
passed over for promotion and are denied equal pay or equal work.</P>
<P>The ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project and its affiliate offices are
involved in more than a dozen workplace bias lawsuits, including:</P>
<P><B>Sension v. University of Denver (Colorado):</B> Mark Sension was hired
in June 1994 by the University of Denver to be  an associate director at a
private school run by the university. About a month later, shortly after he told
his supervisor that he is gay, Sension was fired without warning and escorted
from the university grounds by security personnel.  The supervisor claims that
Sension's firing was &quot;an issue of trust,&quot; since she was not made aware
of his sexual orientation before Sension was hired.</P>
<P><B>Blain v. Golden State Container, Inc. (Arizona):</B> Jeffrey Blain was
hired in January 1993 to work in sales for Golden State Container, a
Phoenix-area manufacturer.  He had a good work record, receiving a 37.5 percent
raise during his first six months.  But several months later, the company fired
him for no reason.  Blain took Golden State to court, claiming that he was fired
because he is a gay man.  The judge instructed the jury that &quot;an employee
is not wrongfully terminated if he is fired for being homosexual.&quot;  Blain
lost his case.</P>
<P><B>Shahar v. Bowers (Georgia):</B> Robin Shahar graduated as an honor
student from Emory Law School in 1991, and accepted a job offer as a staff
attorney with the Georgia Attorney General, Michael Bowers.  But before she
started work, Bowers found out that Shahar had participated in a commitment
ceremony with her lesbian partner, and fired her.  Although Georgia does not
offer job bias protection for gays, the ACLU brought a federal lawsuit claiming
that Shahar's constitutional rights were violated.  The appeal is pending.</P>
<P>These cases, of course, represent only the tip of the iceberg.  Every year ,
the ACLU receives hundreds of phone calls from people who have been
discriminated against because of their sexual orientation -- more than any other
gay-related claim.  The ENDA amendment would confront a serious issue of
unfairness that persists in the American workplace.</P>
<H3>ENDA Provides Much Needed Protection</H3>
<P>As the cases above illustrate, lesbian and gay workers have few legal
protections when they are discriminated against on the job.  Nine states, the
District of Columbia, and about 160 local jurisdictions currently have
non-discrimination laws on the books protecting gays workers: California,
Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island,
Vermont.  While this represents significant progress, this also means that
forty-one states don't have any such laws. In other words, a gay person in those
states (and not in a place with a local law) may be legally fired simply because
of his/her sexual orientation.</P>
<P>In addition, there is no Federal statute protecting lesbians and gay men
from bias in the workplace.  A U.S. postal worker, for example, can be
terminated anywhere in this country without cause if his or her supervisor
decided that a gay person should not be delivering mail.</P>

<P>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides basic legal protections
against employment discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion,
national origin, or disability, but not sexual orientation.  Using Title VII as
a template, the ENDA amendment would prohibit discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation, proving basic protection to ensure fairness in the workplace
for Americans who are currently denied equal protection under the law.</P>
<H3>ENDA Enjoys Broad Support</H3>
<P>ENDA is supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans.  According to a
recent Newsweek poll, 84 percent of Americans who voted last year also support
equal rights for lesbians and gay men in the workplace.</P>
<P>Furthermore, ENDA currently has 137 co-sponsors in the House and 30
co-sponsors in the Senate. ENDA also has the endorsement of President Clinton,
who said in October 1995 that the bill would provide much needed legal
protection, as well as ensure that &quot;all Americans, regardless of their
sexual orientation, can find and keep their jobs based on their ability to work
and the quality of their work.&quot; Other notable supporters include Coretta
Scott King, New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, and former Senator Barry
Goldwater.</P>
<P>Although only nine states have laws barring workplace discrimination based
on sexual orientation, such laws have been adopted by cities and counties --
small and large -- across the country.  Beginning with East Lansing, Michigan in
1972, more than 160 local jurisdictions today have recognized this problem and
passed legislation to include gays and lesbians in their laws against workplace
discrimination.</P>
<P>Recognizing that job discrimination also leads to bad business, more than
1,000 U.S. companies have adopted non-discrimination policies that include
sexual orientation.  A report released by the Human Rights Campaign, a national
gay rights group, found that more than half of the nation's Fortune 500
companies have already adopted similar non-discrimination policies.  ENDA also
has the endorsement of more than two dozen leading U.S. corporations, including
AT&amp;T, Eastman Kodak, Merrill Lynch, Microsoft, RJR Nabisco and Xerox.</P>
<P>Finally, numerous labor unions, religious organizations, civil rights
organizations and newspaper editorials have endorsed ENDA, and it is among the
top legislative priorities of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.</P>
<H3>ENDA Conclusion</H3>
<P>All Americans have a right to be treated equally and fairly at the
workplace, regardless of their sexual orientation.  The ENDA amendment offers
basic civil rights protections for lesbian and gay Americans, and provides
much-needed recourse when they are discriminated against at their jobs.  It is a
reasoned and balanced approach to remedying a serious workplace problem. 
Congress should act immediately to ensure that gay Americans are judged by their
ability and performance on the job, and not by the prejudices of some employers.</P>

<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
<P>DOMA is a divisive and offensive attempt to vilify the relationships of
lesbian and gay American in order to manufacture a political wedge issue. 
Moreover, DOMA is bad law and even worse public policy.  It flouts several basic
constitutional guarantees that hold our nation together and keep the promise of
equality alive for all Americans.  The ACLU considers DOMA to be one of the
worst and most hostile attacks on gay Americans by any Congress in American
history.  Therefore, the ACLU has placed defeating the bill among its top
legislative priorities for 1996, and is urging Congress in the strongest
possible terms to abandon it.</P>
<P>For those in Congress who insist on supporting DOMA, ENDA addresses a
widespread problem in the workplace, and provides basic legal protection for
employees who are currently denied equal protection under the law.  While DOMA
serves to further discriminate against a group of Americans, ENDA ensures that
all Americans are treated fairly and equally on the job regardless of sexual
orientation.  Therefore, the ACLU is urging Congress to attach ENDA to the
anti-gay marriage bill, and outlaw a pervasive problem in the nation's
workplace.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ACLU Fact Sheet: Employment Non-Discrimination Act</H2>
<P>The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) would include sexual
orientation among the Federal employment discrimination protections currently
provided to Americans based on race, religion, gender, national origin, age and
disability.  The ACLU believes that ENDA is an important step towards ensuring
fairness in the workplace, and continues our nation's tradition of judging
employees by their ability and performance.</P>
<UL>
<LI>ENDA prohibits employers from using an individual's sexual orientation in
all aspects of employment, including hiring, firing, promotion, compensation,
and most terms and conditions of employment.</LI>
<LI>ENDA's ban on workplace discrimination protects heterosexuals as well as
lesbians and gay men.  It protects workers who are discriminated against because
they associate with gay and lesbian co-workers, or are perceived to be gay.  It
also shields workers who oppose anti-gay discrimination from retaliation.</LI>
<LI>With few exceptions, several of which are noted below, ENDA provides for
the same protections as existing civil rights laws barring discrimination in the
workplace, including enforcement, remedies, notification procedures, and its
definitions.</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Disparate impact&quot; claims cannot be made under ENDA.  (Under Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, disparate impact claims can be made if an
individual can demonstrate how an employment policy</P>
<P>negatively disadvantages a protected group -- even if the terms of the
policy do not explicitly discriminate, and there is no proof of an intent to
discriminate.)  Therefore, neutral policies which may disproportionately impact
lesbian and gay workers are not covered by ENDA.</P>
<P>ENDA forbids the use of quotas and preferential treatment of any kind based
on sexual orientation.</P>
<P>ENDA exempts religious organizations, including schools and institutions or
higher learning owned or operated by a religious organization.</P>
<P>ENDA has no effect on the armed services.  It does not apply to current
military policies concerning lesbian and gay service members, nor does it apply
to special veterans benefits.</P>
<P>ENDA does not require employers to provide benefits to the partners of
employees.  It neither requires or forbids &quot;domestic partnership&quot;
plans that provide such benefits.</P>
<P>ENDA exempts smaller businesses with fewer than fifteen employees, as do
existing civil rights protections.</P>
<P>ENDA does not apply retroactively.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">American Civil Liberties Union<BR>Testimony On the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act -- H.R. 1863<BR>Submitted to the Subcommittee
on Government Programs of the House Committee on Small Business<BR>July 17,
1996</H2>
<HR>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>The American Civil Liberties Union is a nationwide, nonpartisan organization
dedicated to defending the principles embodied in the Constitution and the Bill
of Rights.  The organization began in 1920 and today is 270,000 members strong.</P>
<P>The American Civil Liberties Union supports the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA).  We believe that in America, the ability to get
and keep a job should depend on ability and willingness to work.  The basic
governing principle ought to be merit, and that same principle should govern
housing and service in public accommodations.  Over the last fifty years, we as
a society have recognized that sometimes the merit system does not work, that
some Americans are denied employment, housing and service for reasons that are
arbitrary and unfair, reasons like race, religion and gender.  When that
happens, our response has been to pass laws aimed at restoring the merit system
by making sure that arbitrary considerations do not govern access to employment,
housing and public accommodations.  These laws, we believe, are an essential
component of making the 14th Amendment's promise of equal protection of the law
real.</P>
<P>The time has come for America to recognize that lesbians, gay men and
bisexuals should be protected from discrimination in the workplace, in housing
and in public accommodations.  ENDA is an important, but in some ways modest
step in that direction.  Congress should pass it without delay.</P>
<H3>The Case For Civil Rights Protection</H3>
<P>Although all arbitrary discrimination is wrong, workplace discrimination is
especially egregious.  In most circumstances in America today, employment is
essential to any kind of a decent life, and it can be essential to survival.  To
deprive anyone of employment is to deprive them of sustenance.</P>
<P>Congress knows how pervasive employment discrimination against gays and
lesbians has been and is.  And case studies about how many gay men and lesbians
have lost or been denied jobs or promotions vastly understate the problem.  The
threat of discrimination is a very real presence in most American workplaces. 
For example, a 1987 Wall Street Journal poll of Fortune 500 executives showed
66% would hesitate to give a management job to a lesbian or a gay man.   Most
gay men and lesbians attempt</P>
<P>to protect themselves against the threat of discrimination by hiding their
identity.   But hiding one's identity is no simple task.  It requires carefully
policing even the most causal conversations, and banishing almost any
acknowledgment of family and friends from the workplace (those who doubt it
should try to see how far they can get through a single day without referring to
a spouse or companion).  In addition to being difficult to do, hiding one's
identity is harmful; it hurts the workplace, building walls between co-workers
and it can impose a terrible psychological toll on those forced to do the
hiding.</P>
<P>It also appears from the best evidence available today that employment
discrimination takes a toll at the most basic level: income.  Although opponents
of civil rights claim that lesbians and gay men are well heeled, the only thing
close to a representative survey suggests that lesbians and gay men generally
earn less than their heterosexual counterparts.</P>
<P>And it is plain today beyond any doubt that discrimination against lesbians
and gay men in the workplace is arbitrary.  Claims that lesbians and gay men are
mentally ill, or that they harm the efficiency of the workplace have been shown
up as baseless myths.  And as Congress discovered just two years ago, the
evidence is now overwhelming that even in the context of the military, lesbians
and gay men are every bit as capable as heterosexuals.</P>
<P>Finally, popular belief to the contrary, lesbians and gay men are not
protected by civil rights laws in most of the United States.  Only nine states
comprehensively prohibit employment discrimination.    Courts have consistently
ruled that sexual orientation is not covered under Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act.</P>
<H3>ENDA: The Response</H3>
<P>Attached to this testimony is a section by section analysis explaining just
what each part of ENDA will do.  In brief, ENDA would ban discrimination based
on sexual orientation in all aspects of employment, including hiring, firing,

promotion, compensation, and most terms and conditions of employment.  Sexual
orientation could no longer be a basis for employment decisions.  ENDA's ban on

discrimination will protect heterosexuals as well as lesbians and gay men, and

it will protect workers who associate with gay and lesbian co-workers.  It will
also protect workers who support it from retaliation.</P>
<P>But as noted above, ENDA is modest.  It applies only to discrimination in
employment, not to housing and public accommodations, and only to employers with
15 or more employees.  ENDA explicitly does not require that fringe benefits be
provided to the partners of lesbian and gay workers.  ENDA explicitly forbids
the uses of quotas or preferential treatment of any kind, and it explicitly does
not permit &quot;disparate impact&quot; claims (see section 4 of the  section by
section analysis for an explanation of disparate impact and ENDA's ban on such
claims).  ENDA does not apply to service in the armed forces and it will have no
effect on veteran's preference programs.  ENDA does not apply to religious
organizations except to the extent that they engage in commercial businesses so
divorced from their religious functions that they are subject to federal income
taxes.  The exemption explicitly includes religious schools and hospitals.</P>
<P>In its basic structure, ENDA parallels Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act, the law which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, religion
and gender.  It provides exactly the same procedures and remedies that Title VII
provides.</P>
<H3>There Are No Convincing Arguments Against ENDA</H3>
<P>ENDA forbids employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, nothing
more and nothing less.  As the Supreme Court recently observed in Evans v.
Romer, anti-discrimination laws are not &quot;special rights.&quot;  To most of
us, the right to have and keep a job, as the court observed, is taken for
granted, either because we are already protected against discrimination or
because we do not face discrimination.  But to those who do face discrimination,
there is noting &quot;special&quot; about a law aimed at preserving your ability
to work--the most essential aspect of ordinary day to day life in America.  See,
Evans v. Romer    U.S.   (May 20, 1996).</P>
<P>The claim that lesbians and gay men as a group represent a threat to
children is untrue, as is the claim that lesbians and gay men have negative
effects on children when they are parents or function as role models, and those
who make those arguments have no respectable scientific support whatsoever.</P>
<P>Finally, the argument that we should deny civil rights protection to
lesbians and gay men to discourage people from being gay is ridiculous. 
Whatever~er the sources of sexual orientation may be, it is very clear that is
not a casual choice, subject to simple change in the face of government
incentive.  More important, in workplace terms there simply is nothing wrong
with being gay.  Lesbians and gay men are capable, neither better nor worse as
employees.  In a pluralistic society in which work is essential to survival, we
can not allow one person's opinions of about the worth, job performance aside,
of another to determine if that other person is able to work.  Perhaps even more
important, in that kind of pluralistic society, we should not use discrimination
in the workplace to try to change the most fundamental aspects of people's
lives.  That is why we ban discrimination based on religion, and why we ban most
forms of marital status discrimination as well.</P>
<H3>ENDA Enjoys Broad Support</H3>
<P>ENDA enjoys broad-based support.   Poll after poll has shown that the
majority of Americans feel that gays and lesbians should have protection from
employment discrimination.  A recent Newsweek poll showed that 84% of the
American public supports ending workplace discrimination against gay men and
lesbians.  ENDA has been endorsed by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights
and is one of LCCR's legislative priorities for the 104th Congress.  In
addition, major corporations -- AT&amp;T, Eastman Kodak, Microsoft, RJR Nabisco,
Quaker Oats, and Xerox -- specifically endorse ENDA.  Numerous religious groups
also support ENDA: National Council of Churches, National Catholic Conference
for Interracial Justice, Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the Union
of American Hebrew Congregations.</P>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>At one time, most of America accepted employment discrimination based on
race and gender.  Both were justified &quot;pragmatically&quot;-- with common
wisdom, later proved false, that women and African Americans, for example, were
not able employees.  Both were also justified &quot;morally&quot;--with the
pious certainty that Italians and Irish, for example, were morally inferior and
that god had ordained that women not work in the home.  Many Americans still
hold such views, but we look back at the days when those views held sway in the
workplace with shame and embarrassment.</P>

<P>It is as plain as it could be that in the not too distant future, we will
look back with shame and embarrassment at an era in which discrimination against

lesbians, gay men and bisexuals was justified with myths about gay people and
the certainty that god approved.  Leaders should lead.  It is time for Congress

to begin the process of putting an end to discrimination based on sexual
orientation.</P>

<H3><A NAME="introduction"></A>INTRODUCTION 
</H3>
<P>As Reconstruction drew to a close more than 100 years ago, the several 
hundred African Americans elected to serve in Southern state legislatures and 
in Congress had dwindled to a handful, and the enactment and enforcement of a 
range of discriminatory laws that excluded black people from the mainstream  of
life -- the system known as &quot;Jim Crow&quot; -- had become pervasive.  
</P>
<P>       Reversing this pattern of exclusion has taken most of the 20th 
century.  In the present decade alone, thanks to districting changes made  after
the 1990 census, progress has been astonishing.  Today, Congress has a  critical
mass of 40 black members who comprise the influential Congressional  Black
Caucus, and nearly 5,000 African Americans hold elective office across  the
South. 
</P>
<P>         This sea change is the direct result of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965, probably the most effective civil rights law ever enacted.  The Act 
immediately outlawed the worst Jim Crow laws, such as literacy tests and  other
devices that kept African Americans out of the voting booth.  Through  active
federal enforcement and the persistent efforts of civil rights groups, 
including the ACLU, the Act has begun to meaningfully empower racial 
minorities.  And gradually, through court decisions and Congressional 
amendments, it has become a weapon against the more subtle schemes that have 
rendered minority votes all but meaningless.  
</P>
<P>          The most common of these schemes is the at-large election, which 
effectively drowns the will of minority voters in a sea of white majority 
voices.  When, as has usually been the case, the white majority votes as a 
racial bloc that is hostile to all minority candidates, none of the latter  can
be elected.  To counter that situation, the Voting Rights Act has been  used to
compel the creation of multiple districts within a jurisdiction, with 
minorities being the majority of voters in some of those districts.  It is 
these predominantly minority districts that almost exclusively elect  minorities
to office.The right to choose one's representatives in the voting  booth is the
linchpin of a free society, without which it is often impossible  to exercise
other rights.  But just as the doors to the halls of government  have begun to
open, whites across the South, abetted by the United States  Supreme Court, are
rushing to close them again.  If they succeed, this  century will end as it
began: with the demise of a second &quot;Reconstruction,&quot;  and a return to
the days of all-white government. 
</P>
<P>         The tide shifted ominously in 1993 when the Supreme Court, on the 
last day of its term, delivered a decision in the case of Shaw v. Reno that 
enabled white voters to challenge the &quot;bizarre&quot; shape of a
majority/black  Congressional district in North Carolina -- even though oddly
shaped  districts have long been tolerated in nonracial cases (see page 23). 
The  decision was narrow, legally speaking, but devastating in its implications.
 White voters and judges have seized upon Shaw as an invitation to question  the
propriety of all race-conscious districting, on every level of  government. 
Suddenly, the Voting Rights Act and its mandate to create equal  opportunity at
the ballot box face the most serious challenge since 1965. 
</P>
<P>          In this 30th anniversary year of the Voting Rights Act, the nation
 stands at a crossroads.  Two critical cases are jointly before the Supreme 
Court, both of which challenge predominantly minority Congressional  districts,
in Georgia and in Louisiana.  The Court's decisions in these cases  will go a
long way toward determining whether the country turns back the  clock and
disfranchises a whole segment of society once again, or reaffirms  and
strengthens its commitment to building a truly representative democracy,  with
liberty and justice for all.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="history"></A>HISTORY 
</H3>
<P>In the 19th Century, during the early days of Reconstruction, Congress
passed  two amendments to the Constitution: the Fourteenth, which guaranteed
African  Americans equal rights under the law, and the Fifteenth, granting black
men  the right to vote.  During that era, 22 African Americans were elected to 
Congress, including two Senators from Mississippi.  More than 700 served in 
Southern state legislatures, with some Southern states being nominally under 
black control. 
</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, whites found myriad ways to circumvent the 
Constitution's promise of equality in a determined effort to keep power out  of
black hands.  With the complicity of the federal courts, the South rewrote  its
state constitutions to legitimate a host of Jim Crow laws and regulations 
designed to keep blacks out of the voting booth and out of government.  These 
included literacy tests imposed on blacks who had never had access to 
education; poll taxes and grandfather clauses; political gerrymandering, and 
the requirement that a prospective voter present vouchers from two already 
registered voters.  Intimidation and violence reigned, directed against any 
black man who tried to register himself or others.  
</P>
<P>         This display of racist ingenuity was a source of pride to South 
Carolina's infamous Senator &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Ben Tillman, who led one of
the  bloodiest campaigns against black enfranchisement. Said Tillman: &quot;We
have  done our level best.  We have scratched our heads to find out how we could
 eliminate every last one of them. We stuffed ballot boxes. We shot them. We 

are not ashamed of it.&quot; 
</P>
<P>          By 1902, white officials had effectively subverted the Fourteenth 
and Fifteenth Amendments, with the courts' approval.  Virtually no black 
elected officials were left, and so the South largely remained until the  advent
of the civil rights movement.  In 1964, Congress passed the Civil  Rights Act,
but voting discrimination continued.  Finally, public outrage  over the
suppression of nonviolent civil rights protesters precipitated  passage of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965.  
</P>
<P>            The new law was designed to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment.  In
 one stroke, Section 4 of the Act abolished literacy tests and all other such 
devices used to discriminate against minority voters.  Section 5, the  so-called
heart of the Act, mandated that any change in election law --  including
something as small as moving a polling place -- must be precleared,  either
through the U.S. Justice Department or through the federal district  court in
the District of Columbia, to ensure that the change did not abridge  minority
voting rights.  Preclearance applied specifically to jurisdictions  that had
previously used a literacy test or the like, and where less than  half of the
voting age residents were registered or had voted. 
</P>

<P>            The number of black registered voters shot up immediately after 
passage of the Act and continued to rise in subsequent decades.  The most 
dramatic changes occurred in Mississippi, the state with the largest black 
population and one of the worst records of racial bias.  There, black 
registration rose from 6.7 percent in 1964 to 70.8 percent by 1986.  
</P>
<P>            But although the most blatant obstacles to minority 
enfranchisement were removed, more insidious obstacles remained.  Even when 
African Americans could register, vote and have their votes fairly tallied, 
their group voting strength was so diluted by racial gerrymandering and 
obstructive election schemes that it was virtually meaningless. 
</P>
<P>            The at-large election was one of the most common and effective 
means of diluting the black vote.  Unlike single member district voting,  where
each district within a given jurisdiction elects its own  representative,
at-large systems allow all voters to vote for all candidates.  Lumping minority
voters with a hostile white majority virtually ensures the  triumph of
candidates chosen by the white majority and the defeat of  candidates favored by
minority voters.  While minority voters have repeatedly  demonstrated, across
the country, their willingness to support white  candidates, whites have just as
commonly demonstrated a tendency not to  support minority candidates.  As a
result, to this day it is predominantly  minority districts, in which minorities
make up more than half the  population, that elect minority candidates.  
</P>
<P>            In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled in White v. Regester that 
at-large election schemes were unconstitutional, if such schemes diluted 
minority voting strength, and mandated the creation of at least some 
minority-controlled election districts.  With that decision in hand, the ACLU 
and other civil rights groups began the hard work of challenging the at-large 
systems in place on every level of government throughout the South.  Two  years
into that process, Congress amended the Voting Rights Act to extend  protection
to foreign language minorities, including Latinos, Native  Americans, Asian
Americans and Alaska Natives. 
</P>
<P>            However, the Supreme Court soon dealt a substantial blow to 
minority voting rights.  In 1980, the Court brought progress to a screeching 
halt when it ruled in City of Mobile v. Bolden that black voters challenging 
the at-large election of officers to the Mobile, Alabama City Commission had  to
show not only that their voting strength was being diluted, but that the  system
had a racially discriminatory purpose.  Proving intent is always  difficult, if
not impossible.  The origins of longstanding practices may be  shrouded in the
past, while legislators have become savvy in masking their  true motives for
adopting certain recent practices.  Judges, in any event,  are reluctant to
label public officials racist. 
</P>
<P>           The Bolden decision would have been a complete disaster, but when
 key sections of the Voting Rights Act came up for renewal in 1982 the civil 
rights community asked Congress to redress Bolden by amending Section 2 of  the

Act to outlaw any plan that resulted in vote dilution -- whether  intentional or

not, and no matter when or where that plan was established. 
</P>
<P>           The Reagan Administration and its allies in Congress bitterly 
opposed these amendments, claiming that they would impose a quota system for 
voting and &quot;pit race against race.&quot; But Congress found that, in fact,
the  &quot;effects&quot; test established in White v. Regester had a reassuring
track record  that belied all predictions of doom.  According to a Senate
subcommittee,  calling minority-controlled districts the cause of, rather than a
response  to, racial polarization was &quot;like saying that it is the doctor's
thermometer  which causes high fever.&quot; Congress passed the amendments by an
overwhelming  majority. 
</P>
<P>           The impact was extraordinary.  After 1982, hundreds of Southern 
cities, counties and towns switched from at-large systems to district voting, 
many compelled by lawsuits or by the Justice Department, others in  anticipation
of such compulsion.  Predominantly minority districts were,  thus, created.  
</P>

<P>            Minority office holding increased dramatically.  In Georgia, for
 example, vote dilution suits were filed against 40 cities and 57 counties 
between 1974 and 1990.  Almost all were successful.  In Alabama, between 1970 
and 1989, 42 of the 48 cities with populations over 6,000 switched to  district
elections.  
</P>
<P>           Change was accelerated by the Congressional redistricting that 
followed the 1990 census (the census is taken every ten years).  Nationwide, 
the number of majority black and Latino districts went from 29 to 52.  New 

predominantly minority districts were created in nine Southern states, and  each

elected a black representative -- which increased the Southern black  delegation

from five to 17.  The Congressional Black Caucus, now 40 members  strong, had
become a force to reckon with.  
</P>
<P>           In 30 years, the Voting Rights Act had altered the face of 
American government.  In 1965, the South had only 72 African American elected 
officials; by 1976, there were 1,944.  Today there are nearly 5,000 -- 68  times
as many as when the Voting Rights Act was passed.  A study published in  1994,
the most comprehensive and systematic to date on the impact of the  Voting
Rights Act, calls the change a &quot;quiet revolution.&quot; 
</P>
<P>            Then, on the last day of its 1993 term, the Supreme Court
lowered  the boom with its decision in Shaw v. Reno, which called into question
the  constitutionality of remedial race-conscious districting.  For the voting 
rights movement, it was like a train wreck at high speed.  
</P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="shaw"></A>SHAW V. RENO 
</H3>
<P>Since 1901, not a single African American had been elected to Congress from 
North Carolina.  But after the 1990 census, in response to pressure from the 
U.S. Justice Department the state created two majority/black districts to 
comply with the Voting Rights Act.  Both of these districts went on to elect 
black representatives in 1992, Eva Clayton in the 1st and Mel Watt in the  12th.
 
</P>
<P>         Watt's district follows Interstate 85 for 160 miles.  Its
snake-like  shape, not much wider than the highway, was influenced by the desire
to  connect cities with substantial black populations and by the desire to 
protect incumbency.  Five white voters went to court, charging that the  12th's
odd shape violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  The plaintiffs filed  suit not as
injured parties who had been victimized by discrimination, but as  spoilers. 
</P>
<P>           A three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court rejected their 
claim, but on appeal the plaintiffs garnered support from a deeply divided 
Supreme Court.  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, called 
the 12th district &quot;so bizarre on its face that it is `unexplainable on 
grounds other than race'.... It is unsettling how closely the North Carolina 
plan resembles the most egregious racial gerrymanders of the past.&quot; 
Moreover, the plan &quot;bears an uncomfortable resemblance to political 
apartheid.&quot;  Still, O'Connor said the district would be constitutional if
it  furthered a compelling state interest and was narrowly drawn, leaving that 
determination up to the district court.  In legal terms, the decision was 
narrow.  But O'Connor's language had the effect of opening the door to a 
wholesale attack on 30 years of progress toward equal voting rights.  
</P>
<P>             For the Court to call the North Carolina plan &quot;apartheid&quot;
was  semantically, historically and politically inaccurate, if not outrageous. 
No  Justice had ever used the word &quot;apartheid&quot; to describe even the
most extreme  efforts to disfranchise black voters.  Yet apartheid, which is the
total  exclusion of one racial group from participation in government and the
total  domination of one racial group by another, would better describe the
system  that existed in North Carolina before 1992, when all districts were
all-white  and no blacks had been elected to Congress in almost a century.  
</P>
<P>             In contrast, the new districts are designed to include
everyone,  equally, in the democratic process.  Whites still enjoy more than
their fair  share of representation: While blacks constitute 22 percent of North
 Carolina's population, only 2 of 12 districts -- 17 percent -- are 
predominantly minority.  In addition, the 12th district is less segregated,  at
57 percent black and 43 percent white, than any Congressional district 
previously drawn in the state.  To call it segregated, while calling a  district
with the numbers reversed integrated, defies logic.  
</P>
<P>            The racial gerrymandering charge is similarly specious. 
Districting has always been politically driven.  Districts are drawn to  reflect
a community of shared values, to consolidate various kinds of support  or to
protect an incumbent.  And Congress and the courts have explicitly  required the
creation of majority/black districts to remedy the effects of  longstanding
discriminatory exclusion. 
</P>
<P>           &quot;If it is permissible to draw boundaries to provide adequate
 representation for rural voters, for union members, for Hasidic Jews, for 
Polish Americans, or for Republicans,&quot; wrote Justice Stevens in dissent, &quot;it
 necessarily follows that it is permissible to do the same thing for members  of
the very minority group whose history in the United States gave birth to  the
Equal Protection Clause.... A contrary conclusion could only be described  as
perverse.&quot; 
</P>
<P>          Shaw also created a new and subjective cause of action based on 
district shape.  Countless oddly shaped districts exist across the country.  For
example, one fishhook-shaped district in North Carolina was drawn decades  ago
to protect a white incumbent's turf.  The courts have never had any  problem

with such irregular borders.  Wrote Justice White in his dissent in  Shaw, &quot;[a]
regularly shaped district can just as effectively effectuate  racially
discriminatory gerrymandering as an odd-shaped one. By focusing on  looks rather
than impact, the majority immediately casts attention in the  wrong direction --
toward superficialities of shape and size, rather than  toward the political
realities of district composition.&quot; 
</P>
<P>          In August 1994, the district court panel, reviewing the North 
Carolina districting plan under the new standard established by Shaw, upheld  it
as constitutional.  That decision has been appealed back to the Supreme  Court.

</P>
<P>          Meanwhile, opponents of voting rights are questioning the
propriety  of all remedial race-conscious districting.  Predominantly minority 
Congressional districts in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas are now  being
challenged, and state and local governments around the country are  under siege
as well.  Many of these cases bear little resemblance to the  facts in North
Carolina.  In Cincinnati, for example, a city where there are  no predominantly
minority districts, a judge cited Shaw in upholding an  at-large election
system.  Several federal courts have struck down oddly  shaped, predominantly
minority districts while upholding the equally odd,  white districts next door
that were drawn to protect incumbents. 
</P>
<P>          Since Shaw, the Supreme Court has continued to chip away at voting
 rights, handing down two more damaging decisions at the end of its 1994 term. 
In Holder v. Hall, the Court upset an ACLU lower court victory by upholding  the
single commissioner form of government in Bleckley County, Georgia --  despite
solid proof of minority vote dilution.  The Court even noted that  &quot;the
District Judge stated that, having run for public office himself, he  `wouldn't
run if [he] were black in Bleckley County.'&quot;  On the same day, the  Court
ruled against minorities in a Florida redistricting case.  In Johnson  v.
DeGrandy, the Court rejected a Section 2 challenge, despite continuing 
discrimination and white bloc voting on the ground that the number of 
predominantly minority districts was &quot;roughly proportional&quot; to
minorities'  share in the population.  
</P>
<P>            More frightening than the Johnson decision was the position 
staked out by Justices Thomas and Scalia, who argued that Section 2 applied 
only to vote denial, not to vote dilution -- a position that flew in the face 
of established precedent and the legislative history of the Voting Rights  Act. 
Three times, in his dissent, Justice Stevens called their view  &quot;radical.&quot;
If adopted, it would amount to virtual repeal of Section 2 and  would threaten
to erase most of the gains made in minority office holding. 
</P>
<P>            Against this backdrop, the two suits before the Supreme Court 
this term are potentially explosive.  Both challenge majority/black 
Congressional districts created in Georgia and Louisiana after the 1990 
reapportionment, and since Shaw was based on the Fourteenth Amendment, not on 
the Voting Rights Act, Congress will not be able to step in and repair the 
damage as it was able to do with the Bolden disaster of 1982.  This time, the 
Court will have the final word, and if it continues on its present course the 
result could be catastrophic. 
</P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="cases"></A>CURRENT SUPREME COURT CASES 
</H3>
<P>The two Shaw copycat suits before the Supreme Court hold the key to the 
future of voting rights.  Each challenges predominantly minority  Congressional
districts created following the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>            Miller v. Johnson.  This suit targets Georgia's 11th district, 
represented by Cynthia McKinney, the first African American woman sent to 
Congress from Georgia. She is a prominent member of the influential 
Congressional Black Caucus, which supports adoption of a fair reapportionment 
plan. 
</P>
<P>           Georgia officials agreed on a plan that would have increased the 
number of predominantly minority Congressional districts from one to two.  But
when the Justice Department objected to the plan, the state responded by 
creating three such districts, including the 11th. 
</P>
<P>            After McKinney's election, the losing candidate led a small
group  of white voters in challenging the districting plan. Invoking Shaw, the 
plaintiffs claimed that the 11th district was unconstitutional because its  &quot;bizarre&quot;
shape could only be explained &quot;as an expression of racial  gerrymandering.&quot;
 But the district court found that, in redistricting, the  legislature &quot;contended
with numerous factors -- racial, political, economic,  and personal.&quot;  In
other words, the state plan &quot;reflected many influences.&quot;  In fact, the
11th district is no more strangely shaped than other districts  drawn in
Georgia.  Moreover, 83 percent of its territory consists of whole  counties --
much higher than the average. 
</P>
<P>           Like everywhere else, the designs of all of Georgia's districts 
are, in large part, political.  The 11th, for example, has an irregular  border
at one point, not to include more blacks but because the chair of the  Senate
reapportionment committee wanted to make sure his son's precinct was  included. 
The 9th district, which is 95 percent white, was designed to bring  together a
distinctive Caucasian community in the state's northern mountains.  Because the
Democratic Speaker of the Georgia House did not want to be  represented by
Republican Newt Gingrich, his entire county was drawn out of  that district,
with other counties being split as a result. 
</P>
<P>          The Speaker himself had this to say about redistricting: &quot;There's
 hundreds of issues because there are hundreds of people wanting their  property
and their county in a different district.&quot; To single out and  challenge
only those districts drawn to consolidate minority votes, in  compliance with
the Voting Rights Act, is particularly indefensible given  Georgia's long
history of disfranchising black voters.  Indeed, racial  discrimination is so
well documented in the state that the court in Johnson  said it did not even
need to hear evidence about it.  
</P>
<P>           To remedy that history, vote dilution suits were filed against 40
 cities and 57 counties in Georgia between 1974 and 1990.  Almost all were 
successful, and every one of the remedial redistricting plans adopted was 
race-conscious.  As the state's Chief Demographer said, &quot;[i]f taking race 
into account were unlawful ... there is not a redistricting plan in the State 
of Georgia that would be valid.&quot;  The predominantly minority districts have
 been overwhelmingly responsible for electing African Americans to state  office
-- only one of the 40 black members of the Georgia general assembly  was elected
from a majority/white district. 
</P>
<P>           The three-judge panel found in Johnson that no one was harmed in 
any way by the new districts, but it still struck down the plan as 
unconstitutional.  The ACLU and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, 
Inc. (LDF), representing a group of black and white voters in appealing to  the
Supreme Court, won a stay allowing the 1994 elections to proceed.  McKinney was
re-elected but will likely lose her seat if the ACLU loses this  suit. 
</P>
<P>           Louisiana v. Hays.  Louisiana's population is 30 percent black. 
Yet it was not until 1990 that the first African American since  Reconstruction
was elected by the state's first predominantly minority  district.  Two years
later, after the Congressional reapportionment, a second  predominantly minority
district was created and a second black, Rep. Cleo  Fields, was elected. 
</P>
<P>           Forty percent of Fields' constituents in the new 4th district
live  in poverty.  Previously, they were represented by white Republicans or by 
white &quot;boll weevil&quot; Democrats who voted against the Civil Rights Act
of 1991  and opposed increasing the minimum wage.  One of Fields' first
proposals in  office was to regulate the fees charged by check-cashing outlets,
whose  customers have no choice but to patronize such outlets because they are
too  poor to maintain bank accounts.  
</P>
<P>          Typically, Louisiana's predominantly minority districts are the 
most diverse and integrated districts in the state.  But a group of four  voters
challenged the redistricting plan and won in district court.  The  three-judge
panel, declaring that &quot;race-conscious redistricting ... is always  subject
to strict scrutiny,&quot; issued its own map for the 1994 elections that 
contained only one predominantly minority district, and that spread the rest  of
the minority population over six districts. 
</P>
<P>           The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted a 
stay that allowed the elections to proceed under the old map.  Fields was 
re-elected.  If Hays is upheld, the constitutionality of all the  Congressional
districting plans -- and almost all the state and local plans  -- currently in
place throughout the South would be in question. 
</P>
<P>            These two cases will be decided together. An adverse ruling
could  cement the direction the Court charted in Shaw and reverse the flow of 
minorities into elected office. 
</P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="districting"></A>RACE-CONSCIOUS DISTRICTING: WHY IT'S NEEDED, WHY
IT WORKS 
</H3>
<P>In a perfect world, remedial race-conscious districting would not be 
necessary.  We would all prefer to live in the color-blind society  hypothesized
by Justice O'Connor in Shaw, but that is simply not reality.  To  claim
otherwise willfully disregards the fact that race has always mattered  in this
society.  Up until the middle of this century, African Americans were  locked
out of the political process and rendered second-class citizens solely  because
of their color.  While literacy tests and poll taxes may have passed  into
history, at-large election schemes, racial polarization and bloc voting  remain
facts of life.  And race-based problems require race-based solutions. 
</P>
<P>Like all such remedies for past discrimination, race-conscious  districting
has always been controversial.  Critics, including some people of  color, charge
that it promotes racial polarization, reinforces stereotypes  and confers
special status on minorities.  These charges do not stand up to  scrutiny.  The
reality is that race-conscious districting works and is the  single most
effective means of remediating the terrible legacy of  discrimination against
minorities.  Districts with predominantly minority  populations increase
minority voter participation, lead to the election of  minority officials and
force government to pay attention to the needs of  previously ignored
communities. 
</P>
<P>But minorities are not the only beneficiaries of such districts.  In the
long run, this remedial strategy has been shown to break down racial 
boundaries, foster diversity in government, benefit communities of all colors 
and strengthen our democracy.  The bottom line is that, without these 
districts, the nation would beat a hasty retreat back to the days of  all-white
government. 
</P>
<P>Districting is political.  Districting is political, by its very  nature. 
As the Supreme Court said in a 1973 decision, &quot;[t]he reality is that 
districting has and is intended to have substantial political consequences.&quot;
 Districts have always been drawn to consolidate communities of shared values 
or heritage -- such as communities of Irish or Polish Americans -- to protect 
incumbents' territory, or to accommodate the personal needs of the  legislators
who do the districting.  

</P>
<P>In the South, districts were a direct product of Jim Crow laws and  racial
gerrymandering.  If the Voting Rights Act did not compel the creation  of
predominantly minority districts, white incumbent legislators would simply 
continue to manipulate district lines to maintain their power base and keep 
minorities out. 
</P>
<P>Predominantly minority districts that are oddly shaped -- often  reflecting
the irregularities of city boundaries -- are in keeping with, not  divergent
from, tradition.  Historically, the courts have approved all kinds  of districts
that were drawn in odd shapes for partisan reasons.  Thus, to  call
predominantly minority districts &quot;apartheid,&quot; as the Supreme Court did
 in Shaw, while accepting without question districts drawn to accommodate,  say,
Irish or Polish Americans, is to apply a discriminatory double standard  in
redistricting.  
</P>
<P>The challenged districting plans have no victims.  One of the  primary
criticisms of the race-conscious remedies mandated under the Voting  Rights Act
is that they violate the rights of white voters.  But the  plaintiffs in Shaw

and subsequent cases did not allege that the remedies  violated their personal
rights in any way.  Instead, they claimed an abstract  injury of being &quot;stigmatized&quot;
by the fact that whites do not have a right to  vote in majority/white
districts, and to elect white representatives. 
</P>
<P>In a 1977 decision, the Supreme Court said that as long as whites  &quot;as
a group, [are] provided with fair representation, we cannot conclude that  there
was a cognizable discrimination against whites or an abridgement of  their right
to vote.&quot;  And representation has always been more than fair:  Whites make
up 70 percent of the population nationwide but dominate 83  percent of the
Congressional districts.  Congress is just over 7 percent  black while the
general population is 12 percent black.  Where is the  discrimination against
whites? 
</P>
<P>Another common criticism is that predominantly minority districts  are
counter-productive because they consolidate and reinforce white,  conservative
voting strength in other districts.  Southern Republicans have  at times
supported redistricting for that very reason.  Most recently, the  1990
Congressional reapportionment has been blamed (or credited, depending on  one's
perspective) for the Republican sweep in 1994.  But the statistics  prove
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>For one thing, districts did not change between 1992, when Democrats  gained
a 41-seat majority, and 1994 when they lost it.  Second, in the nine  states
that drew new predominantly minority districts after the 1990 census,  Democrats
lost 19 percent of their seats in '94; in the 41 other states, they  lost 21
percent.  Even if the Democrats had retained every one of their House  seats in
those nine states -- completely bucking the national trend -- the  Republicans
would still have gained control of the House.  What is true is  that as blacks
have started to play a more active role in the political  process, and
specifically in the Democratic Party, whites have responded by  defecting to the
Republican side.  That development cannot, however, be a  reason to abandon
remedial efforts to achieve equal opportunity in voting. 
</P>
<P>Finally, there is no evidence that race-conscious districting  fosters
racial polarization.  On the contrary, it fosters the gradual  breakdown of
racial barriers -- in voting and in society.  For cross-racial  coalitions to
develop within government, there must first be minority  officials.  And the
creation of an environment in which minorities can be  elected will ultimately
encourage the formation of cross-racial coalitions  outside of government as
well.   
</P>
<P>There are numerous examples of such change in the making.  To name  just
one: When a new black district was created in the Mississippi Delta,  Mike Espy
became the first African American elected to Congress from that  state since
Reconstruction.  In the 1986 election, he got 10 percent of the  white vote and
52 percent overall.  In 1988, he won re-election with 40  percent of the white
vote and 66 percent overall.  This record of minority  achievement bodes well
for the future, notwithstanding Mr. Espy's current troubles. 
</P>
<P>Nonetheless, it will be a long time before color barriers come  tumbling
down.  Our nation is still taking only the first steps toward  integrating
government, and remedial race-conscious districting mandated by  the Voting
Rights Act is still an indispensable tool for dismantling the  structures of
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>A race-based solution to a race-based problem.  At this point, 
predominantly minority districts are virtually the only ones that elect 
minority representatives, owing to the general disinclination of whites to 
support minority candidates.  Of the 17 African Americans elected to Congress 
from the South in 1992 and 1994, all represent predominantly minority 
districts.  Only two blacks have ever been elected from Southern  majority/white
districts, and three elsewhere in the country.  The same  pattern holds true in
state legislatures in the South, where some 90 percent  of African Americans
elected during the 1980s came from majority/black  districts. 
</P>
<P>That is not to say that predominantly minority districts guarantee  the
election of minorities.  In Georgia, for example, in the 1992 House and  Senate
elections such districts chose white candidates to represent them by  25.9
percent.  The point is that, historically, white elected officials have  often
betrayed the interests of minorities and some have been the architects  of
virulent forms of official discrimination.  Justice O'Connor once wrote,  &quot;[t]he
exclusion of minorities from government not only promotes ignorance of  minority
problems ... but also creates mistrust and alienation, and all too  often,
hostility toward the entire process of government.&quot;  
</P>
<P>No completely accurate measure is available to assess the impact  of
empowering minorities in the electoral process, and of having committed 
minority advocates in office.  But evidence does exist to show that while 
minority voting strength most directly benefits minority communities, all 
Americans benefit from the diversity that predominantly minority districts 
produce. 
</P>
<P>The &quot;Profiles&quot; at the end of this report testify dramatically to 
the productive potential of minority electoral empowerment.  Keysville, 
Georgia; Edgefield County, South Carolina, and Georgia's 11th Congressional 
district, in which minority officials were elected, all exemplify the  profound
changes and benefits that predominantly minority districting can  bring to both
black and white communities -- street lights, water supplies,  municipal
employment, fire protection, health care and better schools.  And  all these
areas have seen the development of meaningful communication between  whites and
blacks, where before there was distance, suspicion and hostility. 
</P>
<P>Further evidence of positive results comes from academic studies.  One study
of 10 California cities found that the mere presence of minority  council
members tended to break down polarization and racial stereotyping,  and has &quot;increased
minority access to councils and changed decisionmaking  processes.&quot; The
report also stated that minority political participation was  &quot;associated
with important changes in urban policy,&quot; including the creation  of police
review boards, the appointment of more minorities to commissions,  more jobs for
minority contractors, and a general increase in the number of  programs oriented
to minorities.  Studies in at least four other states,  cited in the Vanderbilt
Law Review, came up with similar results.  
</P>
<P>Increased minority voter influence has also had a positive impact  on the
voting patterns of white officials.  In 1975, for the first time since 
Reconstruction, a majority of the white southern members of Congress voted  for
a major civil rights bill when they supported amendments to the Voting  Rights
Act.  That pattern has continued.  For example, three Southern  senators who
owed their election in large part to black voters were  instrumental in
defeating Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court.  
</P>
<P>Other remedies.  While controversy has raged over race-conscious 
districting in the wake of Shaw, alternative remedies have also received some 
recent attention -- particularly after Lani Guinier's nomination for U.S. 
Attorney General was derailed as a result of her writings on the subject. 
</P>
<P>One discrimination remedy explored by Guinier is the cumulative  system,
whereby voters are allowed a fixed number of votes that they can  choose to
either give to one candidate or distribute among several  candidates.  Another
proposed remedy is limited voting, whereby each voter is  allowed to vote for,
say, 3 out of 5 candidates.  Both of these proposals are  intended to foster the
pooling of minority votes behind a single candidate  and might prove useful in
certain circumstances, such as in local elections  where the minority population
is so dispersed that it cannot be consolidated  in a single district.  However,
an act of Congress would be required to  permit the use of cumulative systems in
Congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>One very successful new tool now being used to remediate  discrimination is
the National Voter Registration Act -- the so-called &quot;Motor  Voter&quot;
law -- which requires states to allow voter registration at motor  vehicle
bureaus, welfare offices and other government agencies, and by mail.  At the
time the Act was passed, an incredible 37 percent of eligible U.S.  citizens --
more than 70 million people -- was unregistered, two-thirds of  that group in
low income households.  
</P>
<P>Since the law took effect on January 1, 1995, after an intensive  lobbying
effort by the ACLU and other civil rights groups, registration rates  have
soared.  In Kentucky, for example, 10,000 voters registered in 10 days,  as
compared to 55,000 throughout 1994.  In Georgia, where 85,000 people  registered
in all of 1994, more than 128,000 had registered by mid-March. 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, considerable resistance to voting reform of all  kinds is
prevalent not only in the South, but throughout the country: 11  states have
refused to comply with the &quot;Motor Voter&quot; law, and lawsuits have  been
filed by the Justice Department and ACLU voting rights advocates in  those
states.  Six bills calling for repeal or suspension of the law are before
Congress. 
</P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="conclusion"></A>CONCLUSION 
</H3>
<P>The Voting Rights Act is arguably the single most successful civil rights
law  ever enacted.  After three decades of enforcement, it has begun to give 
minority populations a voice in government that can be heard in towns,  counties
and states across the nation, and in the halls of Congress.  Partly  due to this
record of success, a growing chorus claims that the law has  outlived its
usefulness, that race-conscious voting remedies are  anachronistic. 
</P>
<P>          In truth, however, such remedies are needed now more than ever. 
The tremendous progress made to date would never have happened if a Voting 
Rights Act had not existed that could be used by the federal government, and  by
groups like the ACLU and the NAACP/LDF, to compel change.  And, as Shaw  and its
offspring demonstrate all too clearly, progress is extremely fragile.  If the
legal scaffolding that supports that progress were suddenly to be  dismantled,
all gains would be lost. 
</P>
<P>          The color-blind society hypothesized in Shaw is still a distant 
dream.  The reality is racial bloc voting, which means not only that  minorities
vote for minorities and whites for whites, but, more  significantly, that whites
vote against minorities.  Minority populations  exceeding 50 percent are still
necessary if those populations are to have any  real chance of choosing their
representatives. 
</P>
<P>Equal representation for minorities also remains a distant dream.  Even with
a record-size Congressional Black Caucus, the proportion of African  Americans
in Congress still falls well below the nation's 12 percent black  population. 
The numbers are even worse in Southern states.  In Georgia, for  example, blacks
make up 25 percent of the voting age population, but only 7.6  percent of
elected officials.  At-large elections and other vote dilution  mechanisms still
abound, especially in small Southern towns that were largely  untouched by the
civil rights movement.  The rights of other minority groups,  such as Native
Americans, are just beginning to be recognized, thanks in  large part to efforts
by the ACLU and other advocates.  
</P>
<P>One entire realm of government -- the judicial system -- has only  recently
begun to feel the reforms made possible by the Voting Rights Act.  Opponents of
voting reform have argued that judges should be exempt from the  Act's
provisions because judges are not meant to represent the population.  In 1991,
the Supreme Court declared that the Voting Rights Act does apply to  the
judiciary, and change is finally underway.  However, some federal courts  have
dismissed voting rights challenges to judicial electoral methods,  despite
evidence of minority vote dilution, on the ground that the state had  a
preclusive interest in maintaining its existing system.  This area of the  law
remains unsettled. 
</P>
<P>Discrimination persists on other levels, around the country: In  New Jersey,
for example, not once but twice during the 1980s the Republican  National
Committee was charged with targeting African American precincts  specifically
with a direct mail campaign that challenged the qualification of  black voters. 
In North Carolina in 1990, the Republican Party sought to  intimidate black
voters by sending them a mailing that contained false  information about voter
residency requirements and alleged criminal penalties  for violating those
requirements.  And in Hartford, Connecticut, a city rule  that disqualifies
voters who fail to report changes of address has led to the  purging of
predominately black and Latino voters from the voting rolls. 
</P>
<P>On this 30th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, we celebrate the  giant
strides taken toward the goal of equal opportunity in the electoral  process. 
At the same time, we call upon the nation to sustain its vigorous  pursuit of
that goal.  Voting is among the most fundamental of rights in a  democracy.
Without a meaningful vote, there can be no equality before the  law, no equal
access, no equal opportunity.  And without an intact Voting  Rights Act, the
threatened return to all-white government will dangerously  polarize our
society.  
</P>
<P>At this moment, the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court are  charged
with a grave responsibility.  In the months ahead, they can either  preserve the
Voting Rights Act or gut it.  In the words of Rep. Cynthia  McKinney, &quot;[t]his
is a turning point in America's history.  We can either  move forward, together,
or we can move back, divided.&quot;

<H3><A NAME="keysville"></A>PROFILES IN EMPOWERMENT :  KEYSVILLE</H3>
<P>&quot;Keysville: the Town Where Everybody's Somebody.&quot;  Those are the 
words that welcome drivers into the 80 percent black hamlet of Keysville, 
Georgia, population: 300.  They are emblazoned on a sparkling white water  tower
that would not exist except for a band of committed townspeople and the  Voting
Rights Act of 1965. 
</P>
<P>What happened in Keysville, 40 miles south of Augusta, is what can  happen
when long-disfranchised minorities finally come into possession of  their right
to vote and determine their own future by exercising that right.  
</P>
<P>Ten years ago, no one could have envisioned the changes that would  take
place in Keysville.  Most residents lived in mobile homes or rundown  shacks,
without bathrooms or running water.  Of the town's 10 wells, many  were
contaminated; only well-off whites could afford to dig new ones.  Many  blacks
caught rainwater in buckets or hauled water from creeks and from  neighboring
towns.  There were no properly paved roads, no streetlights, no  firefighting
equipment, no playgrounds, no clinics or any of the other  services government
customarily provides. 
</P>
<P>For as long as anyone could remember, Keysville had been without a 
municipal government, and the Burke County government simply ignored the  town. 
Frustration boiled over one day in 1984 when a home burned to the  ground
because officials at the county fire station, 18 miles away, said  Keysville was
too far for them to travel to put out a fire. 
</P>
<P>Banding together as the Keysville Concerned Citizens, a group of  residents
went to the county courthouse and discovered that Keysville had  been
incorporated since 1890 and still had a valid city charter.  But in  1933, as
the Great Depression took its toll on the town, whites simply stopped holding
elections.  Determined to reactivate their government, the  Concerned Citizens
posted an unopposed slate of candidates, headed by retired  schoolteacher Emma
Gresham for mayor, and an all-black city council.  Just as  the officials were
about to take office, local whites went to state court to  challenge the
validity of the elections.  They charged that the boundaries of  the town could
not be determined because an old school that had marked the  city limits had
been torn down.</P>
<P>The Concerned Citizens enlisted the support of local state  legislators, and
legal representation from the ACLU and the Christic  Institute.  They found
92-year-old Henry Key, the town's oldest resident and  a descendant of its
founder, who knew exactly where the school had stood.  With Key's  testimony,
the Citizens beat back the election challenge.  However, the white minority went
back to court, citing a new set of  technicalities, and secured a court order
that prevented new elections.</P>
<P>The black citizens' group countered by filing their own lawsuit in  federal
court, charging that the state's failure to preclear the state court  order
violated the Voting Rights Act. &quot;We were talking about our right as  U.S.
citizens living in a democracy,&quot; says Gresham. &quot;[W]e had a right to 
decide what we wanted to do in our own town.&quot; 
</P>
<P>On New Year's Eve in 1988, the Concerned Citizens won their  lawsuit, and on
January 4 new elections were held.  Gresham took office as  mayor (a volunteer
position), and four blacks and one white took seats on the  city council.  The
white challengers continued their legal efforts until a  Supreme Court decision
put an end to the struggle in 1990. 
</P>
<P> Meanwhile, the town underwent nothing short of a revolution.  In  the first
year alone, following the Concerned Citizens' victory, a fire  station was built
just outside of town,  street lights were installed, a city  charter was adopted
and a new post office was established.  The well water  was tested, and five
wells were found to be contaminated.  The town then  secured federal grants to
build a new water system.  
</P>
<P>Change has continued apace.  Paved streets, a new city hall in a  donated
office building, a clinic, a playground and a recreation center have come to
Keysville.  General Education Diploma classes are held regularly,  remedying a

previous lack of educational opportunities.  And for the  children, there are
now a small library, a computer and a van to take them to  cultural and other
events in Augusta.  In addition, the Keysville Junior  Concerned Citizens takes
an active role the town's renaissance.  Presiding  over it all is the shining
symbol of Keysville's pride and joy, a city water  system completed in 1993. 
For the first time, clean water is piped into every home in town. 
</P>
<P>At the same time, blacks and whites in the town have come together  in a way
that had not seemed possible.  &quot;We had to get to know one another,&quot; 
says Gresham.  &quot;You have to love the hell out of people.  You forgive them 
for not knowing any better, and you just go ahead and make life better for 
everybody.  We wanted the white residents to know that what we do for  progress
in Keysville will be yours too.&quot; 
</P>
<P>That message got through.  The new government's principal opponent was the
family that owns the town's most prosperous business, a  convalescent home.  At
first, they wanted no part of the new Keysville and  moved their nursing home
outside the city  limits.  But when the pipes were  being laid for the water
system, they had a change of heart.Recalls Gresham:  &quot;I got a letter
saying, `we want to be a part of what you're doing.  Annex us to the city and
we'll be your best customer.'&quot;  She agreed, securing another  grant to
extend the water pipes into the nursing home.  The grant required that the home
hire area residents, and 12 people got jobs.  &quot;The split,&quot; says 
Gresham, &quot;is over.&quot; 
</P>
<P>As for the man who ran for mayor against Gresham, he gradually  began
stopping by her office &quot;just to talk.&quot;  When a vacancy came up on the 
city council, she urged him to run, and he won. &quot;He is now one of my best 
working city council persons,&quot; she says.  
</P>
<P>Political participation has also skyrocketed in Keysville. Before,  the only
blacks who voted were a few employees of the convalescent home,  whose votes
were controlled by their bosses. Now Keysville has a 95 percent  voter turnout
at every single election.  
</P>
<P>The changes in Keysville have reverberated around the region.  Once
compelled to build a fire station in Keysville, for example, Burke County built
several more.  Now there are fire stations within five to eight miles of every

small town in the county.  
</P>
<P>As for Keysville, plans for the future include updating the sewage  system
and building a school in town so the younger children won't have to be  bused 18
miles.  The most important task of all, says Gresham, is &quot;to keep 
motivating our people. It's so easy to get complacent.&quot; 
</P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="edgefield"></A>PROFILES IN  EMPOWERMENT:  EDGEFIELD COUNTY</H3>
<P>Nowhere was the fight to keep African Americans out of the voting  booth
more bitter and violent than in Edgefield County, South Carolina.  During

Reconstruction, rifle and sabre clubs in virtually every town operated  as a
terrorist wing of the Democratic Party.  Armed whites took control of  polling
places to keep blacks from voting, and provoked riots in which blacks  were
killed. 
</P>
<P>Senator &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Ben Tillman, who went on to become governor, 
simply abolished local elections in order to keep blacks out.  In recent  times,
Edgefield County was home to the late governor, and then senator,  Strom
Thurmond, a longtime opponent of desegregation who fought tooth and  nail
against the Voting Rights Act and all its amendments.  
</P>
<P>In 1974, educator Tom McCain ran for a seat on the County Council,  becoming
the first African American to seek elected office in the county  since
Reconstruction.  McCain won in black districts, but since the elections  were
at-large and whites simply would not vote for blacks, he lost the election and
another in 1976. 
</P>
<P>With the ACLU's help, McCain and a group of African Americans filed  suit,
charging that the county's at-large system violated the Voting Rights  Act.  Ten
years of litigation resulted in a 1984 Supreme Court victory, and  the
establishment of single member district voting.  When elections were  held,
blacks won a 3-2 majority on the council and control of Edgefield  County. 
McCain, who had not run, was appointed by the County Council to the  powerful
position of County Administrator. 
</P>
<P>Between 1984 and today, Edgefield County has seen profound change  --
starting with the delivery of basic services to a chronically ignored  black
community.  For example, &quot;Before blacks held elected office,&quot; McCain 
recalls, &quot;the county always picked up white folks' garbage and sometimes it
 picked up black folks' garbarge.  Now, we just pick up the garbage.&quot;  
</P>
<P>He also recollects: &quot;You could drive through the council chairman's
community and find roads paved through peach orchards. It seems like that's
where the money ended up.&quot;  No more.  Now poor, black communities have
paved  roads too, where there were none before.  McCain claims, however, that
his  government &quot;was not aimed at one community over the other community. 
We  provided service for everybody, without looking at a community to see if it 
was black or white.&quot; 
</P>
<P>Due to the success of a school bond referendum to overhaul and  update the
badly deteriorated school system, two schools were completely  renovated, two
new schools were built and the high school was expanded.  Under a comprehensive
economic development plan, the county attracted new  industries that invested
more than $100 million in the county and generated  1,000 new jobs.  A federal
prison is currently under construction that is  expected to provide even more
jobs. 
</P>
<P>In addition, the entire face of government in the county has  changed.  Once
the white stranglehold on local power was broken, African  Americans ran and won
seats not only on the County Council, but on the school  board, the city
council, the election commission, the registration board --  and in Congress as
well.  And many more blacks have been hired to work in  government offices, and
assume positions of authority. &quot;Black people would go  to these offices to
receive service and they had never seen anybody that  looked like them before,&quot;
remarks McCain.  
</P>
<P>Change has brought about the narrowing of a previously huge gap  between the
living conditions of blacks and whites in Edgefield County. 
</P>
<P>After serving as County Administrator for ten years, Tom McCain  resigned in
1994 to resume his career as an educator.

<H3><A NAME="georgia"></A>PROFILES IN EMPOWERMENT:  GEORGIA, 11TH
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT</H3>
<P>&quot;I don't want to draw any nigger districts,&quot; remarked the chairman
 of the Georgia legislature's Reapportionment Committee in 1981, during that 
state's Congressional redistricting effort.  His words did not prevail. 
Predominantly minority districts were created for Congress (the 5th) and for 
the state legislature.  By 1991, an expanded and empowered black caucus 
occupied Georgia's general assembly.  
</P>
<P>The caucus fought for a new Congressional reapportionment plan that  would
fairly enfranchise the state's 25 percent black population.  The plan  agreed
upon by the legislature included two majority/minority districts.  However, the
U.S. Justice Department rejected the plan because it limited the number of
majority black districts to two and fragmented concentrations of  minorities. 
In response to that objection, the state created a third  majority black
district -- the 11th.  In 1992, Cynthia McKinney ran in the  new district and
won a resounding victory, becoming the first African American woman to ever
represent Georgia in Congress. 
</P>
<P>The white man who lost to McKinney led a small group of white  voters in
filing a lawsuit that claimed the district plan was  unconstitutional under the
Fourteenth Amendment.  The suit prevailed in the  lower court, but the Supreme
Court granted a stay that allowed the 1994  elections to proceed.  McKinney was
re-elected, and the suit challenging her  district is one of the two pivotal
cases currently before the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>McKinney claims that her new administration wasted no time in  tackling long
ignored problems, &quot;the suffering of average, ordinary people --  mostly
black, many white -- who have never had anybody who was disconnected  enough
from the power structure to listen to them.&quot; 
</P>
<P>One low-income community had been so contaminated by industrial  pollutants
for so long that its residents were getting sick and dying.  On  the day of her
swearing in, McKinney sought help from federal agencies in  initiating an
extensive study of the area.  Health screenings and appropriate  medical care
are now being provided, and residents who need to relocate are  getting support
to do so. 
</P>
<P>McKinney also became the first official to challenge a major  industry in
her district that mines most of the nation's reserves of the  clay-like mineral,
kaolin.  Several companies bought up mining rights for  virtually nothing, to
the detriment of small landowners and the area's tax  base.  Two Justice
Department investigations of the industry are now  underway. 
</P>
<P>Its mostly white farmers are among the beneficiaries of the  district's
creation: In the wake of a region-wide drought, the 11th was the  first district
to have one its counties declared a disaster area.  
</P>
<P>McKinney believes that the simple presence in Congress of a  southern
African American woman has a palpable impact, both in Washington and  at home. 
She tells of the time she was stopped by a Capitol Hill elevator  operator from
boarding an elevator reserved for Members of Congress.  &quot;Later  on,&quot;
she recalls, &quot;I found out that this woman grew up in Jefferson County, 
11th district, Georgia.  It never crossed her mind that the person who 
represents her would be a black woman.&quot;  Now, few of her constituents would
 make the same mistake. 
</P>
<P>Since the 1992 elections, when only one black had been elected to  office in
Jenkins County, there are now seven -- &quot;for no other reason,&quot; says 
McKinney, &quot;than that people now feel there's a possibility of winning.&quot;

</P>
<P>McKinney attributes the achievements of her district to the Voting  Rights
Act and the predominantly minority districts it mandated:

enough to find a black person that can look a white person in the eye  and speak
as an equal.  At least as a member of Congress I can look whites in  the eye and
talk about issues that they would never talk about if they were  speaking with a

Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia

<H3>Section 5</H3>
<P>This section was designed to prevent states and other governmental entities
with a history of voting discrimination from continuing to devise  new ways to
discriminate after the abolishment of prior discriminatory  practices.  Section
5 requires certain covered jurisdictions to submit any  proposed voting changes
in their election law or practices, prior to  implementation, for federal
approval by either the Attorney General of the  United States or the Federal
District Court for the District of Columbia.  Covered jurisdictions must
demonstrate that the proposed voting changes do  not have the purpose or the
effect of discriminating against protected racial  or language minorities.  This
process is referred to as the preclearance  process. 
</P>
<P>Minority Language Groups:  The minority language groups covered by the
Voting Rights Act are Native  Americans, Asian Americans, Alaska Natives, and
persons of Spanish heritage. 
</P>
<P>Minority Language Provisions:  The Voting Rights Act was amended in 1975 and
1992 to include political  jurisdictions with language minority groups and
requires such jurisdictions to furnish bi-lingual assistance to language
minority citizens at all stages of the voting process and in all elections.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Facial Challenge to the Military's &quot;Don't Ask, Don't
Tell&quot; </B></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Ban on Lesbian and Gay Servicemembers</H3>
<H4>The Case.</H4>
<P>Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, <I>Able
v. USA</I> challenges the constitutionality of the military's latest ban on open
lesbian and gay service members, which was signed into law by President Clinton
in 1993.</P>
<P>The Lesbian and Gay Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union and
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the national gay legal organization,
represent six lesbian and gay plaintiffs -- two active and four reservist.</P>
<P>The plaintiffs contend that the law is discriminatory and violates their
constitutional rights to equal protection and free speech and the rights of all
lesbian and gay men in the service.  They further contend that the statute and
regulations serve no legitimate military interest, impose punitive rules on
lesbian and gay service members that are unrelated to the ability to serve, and
are solely based on prejudice. In addition, plaintiffs intend to prove at trial
that the statute and regulations unconstitutionally burden and chill the speech
and expression of gay and lesbian service members.  <I>(Able et al v. USA, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 95-9111 (L))</I></P>
<P><B>The Legislation.</B></P>
<P>The &quot;National Defense Authorization Act,&quot; the current statute that
bars lesbians and gay men from openly serving their country, was passed by
Congress on November 17, 1993. The presence of openly gay and lesbian service
members, according to the law's stated rationale, assertedly poses &quot;an
unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline,
and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability....&quot; because
of the discomfort their mere presence supposedly causes heterosexual soldiers
and sailors.</P>
<P>The Act mandates that a service member &quot;shall be separated&quot; if one
or more of three findings is made: (1) that the &quot;member has engaged in, 
attempted to engage in, or solicited another to engage in a homosexual act or
acts,&quot; (2) that the &quot;member has stated that he or she is a homosexual
or bisexual, or words to that effect,&quot; (3) that the &quot;member has
married or attempted to marry a person known to be of the same biological sex.&quot;</P>
<P>Plaintiffs allege that the Act and regulations violate their constitutional
rights in the following ways: (1) they violate the Fifth Amendment, which
provides for equal protection of the law because they intentionally discriminate
against gay and lesbian service members and subject them to different and
punitive treatment, (2) they violate their First Amendment rights of free speech
and free expression because they proscribe, punish and chill all public and
private speech and expressive behavior that would tend to identify them as gay
men or lesbians, and do so on the basis of the content and viewpoint of such
speech and expression, and (3) they violate First and Fifth Amendment right of
expressive association because they punish any associational  activity that
might identify plaintiffs as lesbian or gay service members.</P>
<P>Passage of the statute marked the first time in our nation's history that
the military's anti-gay discrimination had been codified in federal law, making
the armed services, which together are the largest employer in the country, one

of the last bastions of official, governmentally sanctioned discrimination in
America.</P>

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3></CENTER>
<H4>The docket.</H4>
<P>This docket summarizes the work of the American Civil Liberties Union's
National Lesbian and Gay Rights Project and the work of the ACLU's 53 state
affiliates on gay rights issues.  The ACLU works on more lesbian and gay related
litigation and legislation than any other organization.  </P>
<P>The docket focuses primarily on litigation, but it also includes summaries
of some of the legislative advocacy undertaken by the state affiliates.  The
docket is organized by subject, and within each subject by state. It was
compiled during the summer of 1996, with an effective cut-off date of September
15, 1996.</P>
<H4>The staff.</H4>
<P>The Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, based in New York, coordinates the
ACLU's gay-related work nationwide.  <B>Matt Coles</B> is the Director, <B>Michael
Adams</B> and <B>Marc Elovitz</B> are Staff Counsel.  <B>H. Alexander Robinson</B>
is the Project's legislative representative in Washington, D.C.  <B>Denny Lee</B>
handles media relations.<B>  Ben Dinglasan</B> is the Development Associate,
and <B>Jerl Surratt</B> is the Project's Development Consultant.  Three ACLU
affiliates have lawyers who specialize in lesbian and gay rights: <B>Roger
Leishman</B> at the ACLU of Illinois, <B>Kelli Evans</B> at the ACLU of
Northern California, and <B>Taylor Flynn</B> at the ACLU of Southern
California.</P>
<H4>The supporters.</H4>
<P>The Lesbian and Gay Rights Project is largely supported by individuals and a
few Foundations.  We are deeply grateful for the support of the Projects' major
donors, the Friends and Associates.  The ACLU is able to do all the work it does
because of the many lawyers who volunteer their time as cooperating attorneys. 
We have only been able to mention the names of some of the scores of cooperating
attorneys here.  We are deeply grateful to all of them for the time they give
us.</P>
<H4> We Need Your Help</H4>
<P>Like all ACLU special projects, the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project is funded
solely by contributions specifically designated for it.  The ACLU accepts no
government money of any kind; it depends entirely on gifts from individuals and
a small number of foundations.  The Project's ability to work toward equality
depends on your willingness to support it.</P>
<H4>Why Give To the Project</H4>
<P>Because it is a part of the ACLU, the Project brings a unique voice to the
fight for lesbian and gay rights.  The ACLU puts lesbian and gay rights in
context as part of a larger program to preserve and promote basic rights for all
Americans.  Because of its strong national presence and its nationwide affiliate
 network, the ACLU can respond to discrimination whenever it occurs. </P>
<H4>Ways to Help</H4>
<P>Contributions to the ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project are
tax-deductible, and support both national and local work.  The Project has a
FRIENDS group for those who contribute $1,000 or more per year, and an
ASSOCIATES group for those who give $500 or more per year, but every
contribution helps.  We can also provide help with bequests, life income and
other planned gifts which may have unique tax and financial benefits.  </P>

<H2>SPOTLIGHT ON 1996</H2></CENTER>
<H3><A NAME="romer"></A>Our Finest Day In Court:<BR>Romer v.  Evans</H3>
<P>In what is doubtless the most important lesbian and gay rights case ever,
the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Colorado's Amendment 2 in <I>Romer v. Evans</I>.
 Amendment 2, passed by the voters in 1992, would have deprived every branch of
government of the power to protect lesbians and gay men from discrimination. 
When it passed, it was immediately challenged by a coalition of groups including
the National ACLU Lesbian &amp; Gay Rights Project, the ACLU of Colorado, the
ACLU of Northern California, Lambda Legal Defense and a coalition of Colorado
groups.</P>
<P>	After the Colorado Supreme Court twice upheld lower court orders preventing
Amendment 2 from taking effect, the state appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
In a sweeping 6-3 decision, the court struck Amendment 2 down for good.  It gave
two reasons for doing so.  First, it said, devices which take away all of a
state's power to protect any group from discrimination are simply inconsistent 
with the very idea of &quot;equal protection of the law.&quot;  That is good
news indeed.  It means neither gay people nor anyone else will ever have to face
another initiative designed to prevent them from ever being protected by civil
rights laws.</P>
<P>	The Court's second reason for striking down Amendment 2 was that its
different treatment of lesbians, gay men and bisexuals was motivated by
hostility.  Animosity, the court said, is never a legitimate reason for treating
one group of Americans differently.  </P>
<P>	This part of the decision will be very important in all sorts of future

cases involving lesbians and gay men.  For ten years now (since the Supreme
Court decision in <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I> upholding Georgia's sodomy law)
cities, states and the federal government have been allowed to justify
discrimination in everything from child custody to employment by saying that
society disapproves of gay people.  That day is over.  From now on, dislike,
disapproval, etc. will not be enough.  Government will need <I>legitimate</I>
reasons for treating lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans differently.  </P>
<P>	This doesn't mean we will necessarily win all of these cases; the
government will make other arguments that discrimination serves legitimate
purposes, and we will have to fight them.  But the <I>Romer</I> decision does
take away the &quot;slam dunk&quot; defense the government have had up until
now.</P>
<P>	But the tone of the <I>Romer</I> opinion, and what it says about the
movement for lesbian and gay equality, may prove to be the most important part
of the decision.  The court decided to take on the argument that protecting
lesbians and gay men from discrimination is &quot;special rights.&quot;  It gave
the most eloquent answer to that slogan that anyone has given so far.</P>
<P>	The right to be able to work, to have a home, to eat in a restaurant
without fear of being thrown out because of who you are, is, the court said,
taken for granted by most of us.  We either have that right in law, or we have
no need for it because we do not face that kind of discrimination. But to those
who do face it, civil rights laws are the only thing preventing exclusion from
the limitless activities that &quot;constitute ordinary life in a free society.&quot;
 &quot;We find nothing special,&quot; the court said, &quot;in the protections
Amendment 2 withholds.&quot;</P>
<P>	It is important to keep these words in context.  The decision does not say
that lesbians and gay men are now legally protected from discrimination. 
Amendment 2 said neither cities nor the state of Colorado itself would ever have
the power to protect gay people from discrimination.  The Supreme Court ruled
that the power of government to decide that we should be protected can not be
taken away.  Whether we will be protected is up to lower courts, legislatures,
city councils and Congress.  Which means, of course, that it is up to us to
convince them.
</P>
<P>	In effect, the court gave us the &quot;level playing field&quot; we were
asking for.  But it sent us back into the fray with a boost of inestimable
value.  For in addition to its powerful answer to the special rights argument,
the Court gave us a remarkable, deeply stirring statement about the legitimacy
of our case for equality.</P>
<P>	Justice Kennedy began his opinion for the court by invoking the most famous
dissent in American legal history: Justice Harlan's opinion in <I>Plessy v.
Ferguson</I>, the case that upheld racial segregation.  &quot;One century ago,&quot;
Justice Kennedy wrote, &quot;the first Justice Harlan admonished this Court that
the Constitution 'neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.'  <I>Plessy
v. Ferguson</I>, 163 U.S. 537, 559 (1896) (dissenting opinion).&quot;  Although
those words were unheeded at the time, Kennedy wrote, our acceptance of their
wisdom today requires that Amendment 2 be struck down.</P>
<P>	The message could not be much plainer.  The closest thing we have to an
institutional conscience in this country says that discrimination against
lesbians and gay men is wrong, the moral equivalent of race and sex
discrimination.  That is the single most powerful thing any institution has ever
said about our fight for equality.  Now it is up to us to make the most of the
it.</P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="military"></A> &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; --<BR>The
Overall Picture</H3>
<P>The &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; ban on gays in the military has two
parts.  The so-called &quot;statements&quot; part says that gay men and lesbians
may not say or do anything which reveals that they are gay.  The second, the
so-called &quot;conduct&quot; part says that lesbians and gay men may not do
anything affectionate or sexual with each other.  It also says that gay people
who engage in misconduct, like sexual harassment, will be punished more harshly
than heterosexuals who do the same thing.</P>
<P>	Until <B><I>Able v. USA</I></B>, most attacks on anti-gay military
policies focused on the statements ban (the first part), arguing that it was a
violation of due process and freedom of expression to exclude lesbians and gay
men just for being gay or talking about it.  The military responded, with an
argument accepted so far by every federal appeals court, that it was ejecting
gay people because it was reasonable to assume that someone who said he or she
was lesbian or gay was more likely than someone else to violate the conduct
rule.  </P>
<P>	<I>Able</I>, the joint challenge put together by the ACLU Lesbian and Gay
Rights Project and Lambda Legal Defense takes a new approach.  Building on the
Congressional record from the 1994 hearings on &quot;don't ask, don't tell,&quot;
the case maintains that it simply is not correct to say that the military ejects
lesbians and gay men because it believes we will violate the conduct rules.  The
only reason behind the ban (both the conduct and the statements portions), we
argue, is the military's belief that heterosexuals will be so disconcerted if
they <I>know</I> they are serving with lesbians and gay men that they, the
heterosexuals, will be unable to do their jobs.  That means, <I>Able</I>
argues, that the only purpose of the policy is to prevent communication, and it
should fail under the First Amendment for that reason.</P>

<P>	Equally important, the <I>Able</I> case argues, the &quot;conduct&quot;
rules themselves are unconstitutional.  The only reason for having a different
set of rules about affectionate and sexual conduct is that the military believes
that heterosexual troops disapprove of both sex and affection by lesbians and
gay men.  But, we argue, discrimination against one group of Americans can never
be justified on the basis that another group disapproves of them.</P>
<P>	The District Court in Brooklyn accepted the first argument, and struck down
the policy without reaching the second.  In July, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit sent the case back to District Court.  The Second
Circuit accepted as plausible the government's argument that it was using &quot;statements&quot;
to identify people who might violate the conduct rules.  But the court said,
that begged the question of whether the different conduct rules were
constitutional.  The Court sent the case back to the District Court for a
decision on that issue.</P>
<P>	<B><I>Philips v. Perry</I></B>, a case being handled on appeal by the
ACLU Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, only challenges the conduct portion of the
law.  When asked, Petty Officer Philips said that he had been intimate with
other men, although never on board a ship, on duty, or with another service
member.  This case takes the same approach that <I>Able</I> takes.  It was
argued before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in March.</P>
<P>	In <B><I>Thomasson v. Perry</I></B>, the full United States Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the policy in the face of an attack on the
&quot;statements&quot; rule.  The plaintiff has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to
take the case.  The ACLU and Lambda filed a &quot;friend of the court&quot;
brief making arguments similar to those made in <I>Able</I>.  	</P>
<P>	<B><I>Richenberg v. Perry</I></B> is another &quot;statements&quot; case.
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit upheld the policy,
over one dissenting opinion.  The ACLU and Lambda filed a &quot;friend of the
court&quot; brief making arguments similar to those made in <I>Able</I>. </P>
<P>	<B><I>Holmes v. Perry</I></B> and <B><I>Watson v. Perry</I></B> are
pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
Although <I>Holmes</I> is a &quot;statements&quot; case, it takes an approach
similar to that taken in <I>Able</I>.  The trial court treated <I>Watson</I>
as a conduct case much like <I>Philips</I>, although the plaintiff insists that
it is a statements only case.  The ACLU and Lambda filed a &quot;friend of the
court&quot; brief making arguments similar to those made in <I>Able</I>. </P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="marriage"></A> DOMA &amp; ENDA: <BR> Not the Rout It Appeared to
Be</H3>
<P>To many, it looked at first glance like two crushing defeats on the same
day: Congress passed the so-called &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; (DOMA),
designed to minimize recognition of lesbian and gay marriages when Hawaii
permits them, and the Senate failed to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination
Act (ENDA), the law which would have made it illegal to discriminate in
employment on the basis of sexual orientation.  </P>
<P>	But viewed in perspective, the ENDA vote has to be counted a win.  Some
version of the law has been in Congress every session since 1976.  The bill has
never gotten out of committee before.  This time, it was not only considered by
the full Senate, it came within a single vote of passage in a Republican
controlled Congress.  With this vote, there is a good chance that ENDA will move
along further in the next Congress.</P>
<P>	ENDA's strong showing was due in large part to the steadfast advocacy of
Senator Kennedy, support from a broad coalition of civil rights groups, and the
lobbying of the Human Rights Campaign (HRC).  The Project's Washington lobbyist
worked with HRC on passage, and for the first time, we marshaled affiliates in
an effort to lobby Congressmen and Senators on both DOMA and ENDA.  </P>
<P>	The Project's legal staff in New York helped HRC draft the original text,
and worked on amendments into the final days before the vote. The entire text
will be reviewed before the next Congress begins.   At the same time, ACLU
affiliates around the country will continue to work for state and local non-bias
laws in a continued push for ENDA.</P>
<P>	DOMA was a defeat, to be sure -- although there were actually more votes
against it than most people expected.  But the section of the law which purports
to allow states to ignore same-sex marriages performed in other states may not
mean very much.  Indeed, the battles over recognition are likely to turn on
state law and the federal constitution -- not DOMA.  The ACLU has been working
with Lambda Legal Defense to devise a careful, thought out strategy to focus the
gay community's resources on cases and litigation which are most likely to win
wide spread recognition of same-sex marriages.</P>
<P>	The other part of DOMA, under which federal programs do not recognize
same-sex marriages, will also take some time to undo.  But they are also
vulnerable if attacked thoughtfully.  </P>
<P>	So while DOMA was a defeat, the battle is far from over.  The ACLU and
other groups are already implementing a strategy which we think will ultimately
be its undoing.</P>

<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Colorado</H5></CENTER>
<P>(For discussion on<B><I> Romer v.  Evans</I></B>, the historic challenge
to the state's anti-gay Amendment 2 struck down by the Supreme Court, see <I>&quot;Spotlight
on 1996</I>&quot; above.)</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Idaho</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Anti-Gay Initiative</B><BR>	Within eight months of the defeat by Idaho
voters of the 1994 anti-gay initiative, the Idaho Citizens Alliance (the
initiative's sponsors) filed another anti-gay initiative for the 1996 ballot. 
</P>
<P>	The ACLU of Idaho submitted argument to the Attorney General explaining why
the initiative is not constitutional.  Subsequently, the Attorney General issued
a certificate of review in which he noted various constitutional problems with
provisions in the initiative and advised the ICA to delay the initiative until
after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <I>Romer v. Evans</I>.  </P>
<P>	However, the ICA only slightly revised the initiative before circulating it
 for petition signatures.  Working with the statewide coalition opposing the new
anti-gay initiative, the ACLU of Idaho campaigned heavily to persuade Idaho
voters not to sign the initiative.  </P>
<P>	On July 1, 1996, just prior to the signature gathering deadline, the ICA
abandoned the anti-gay initiative.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Kentucky</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Anti-Gay Initiative Bills</B><BR>The ACLU of Kentucky opposed three
bills seeking to make Kentucky an &quot;initiative state&quot; with a Colorado
Amendment 2-type statute.  All died in Committee. 
</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Maine</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Wagner v. Cosby</B><BR>	The Maine Civil Liberties Union and Boston's
Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) brought this pre-election
challenge to an initiative proposed by Concerned Maine Families.  The initiative
would have amended Maine law to say that no locality could pass a law preventing
discrimination based on any characteristic unless the characteristic is one of
those specified in the initiative.  Sexual orientation was not on the
initiative's list.  Although the initiative, entitled, &quot;An Act to Limit
Protected Classes Under Maine Law,&quot; made no specific reference to gays and
lesbians, Concerned Maine Families left little doubt that excluding gays,
lesbians and bisexuals from anti-discrimination protection was the purpose of
the bill.  The bill would have repealed Portland's existing ordinance
prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</P>
<P>	The primary argument in the challenge was that the initiative was a veiled
effort to amend the Maine Constitution (which cannot be done by initiative) on
the ground that it purported to prevent the state legislature from ever adopting
a law protecting lesbians and gay men.  The Maine Law Court held that the
initiative could be interpreted only to prevent cities from passing
anti-discrimination laws, and that so interpreted, it would be constitutional.
In the event of the initiative passing, the MCLU and GLAAD prepared a
post-election challenge.  The initiative was rejected by the voters in November
1995.  The MCLU was assisted by cooperating attorney Patricia Peard.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Ohio</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Equality Foundation v. Cincinnati</B><BR>	On November 2, 1993, the
voters of Cincinnati approved &quot;Issue 3&quot; an amendment to the city
charter which deprives all branches of local government of the power to pass
laws that ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  It also
repealed the existing nondiscrimination law.  The ACLU of Ohio, joined by
attorneys from Lambda Legal Defense Fund, challenged the initiative in Federal
District Court and obtained a landmark ruling striking down the measure as
unconstitutional.</P>
<P>	The City and the initiative's proponents appealed to the Sixth Circuit,
which reversed the District Court's decision concluding that since &quot;homosexual
conduct&quot; may be criminalized without offending the Constitution,
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is not constitutionally
suspicious.  The ACLU and Lambda petitioned the Supreme Court to take the case

<P><B>Doe v. Keisling I</B> and <B>Doe v. Keisling II</B><BR>	The ACLU of
Oregon is spearheading two challenges to an anti-gay ballot initiative slated
for the November 1996 election.  Popularly referred to as &quot;Daughter of 13&quot;
because it most closely resembles Measure 13 from 1994, it is styled by its
promoters the &quot;Child Protection Act.&quot;  See Keisling I and II.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Rooney, et al. v. Keisling I and II</B><BR>	These are two ballot title
challenges to Oregon Citizens Alliance proposed anti-gay constitutional
amendments slated for the November 1996 ballot.  Oral arguments before the
Oregon Supreme Court took place on May 11, 1995.  The OCA withdrew four of its
eight petitions and the Oregon Supreme Court certified ballot titles for the
remaining four.  The certified language adopts some of the language proposed by
the ACLU and does not reflect the wishes of the OCA.  After certification, the
OCA chose the initiative for which it will gather signatures.  After the
decision in <I>Romer</I>, the OCA abandoned the effort.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Boytano v. Klamath Falls</B><BR>	The ACLU of Oregon is providing direct
representation on this appeal of a pre-election challenge to a local OCA
measure.  The challenge argues that HB 3500, which prohibits &quot;enacting&quot;
laws that single out individuals based on sexual orientation, prohibits
elections on OCA anti-gay and lesbian rights initiatives.  The Oregon Supreme
Court accepted review and oral arguments took place May 4, 1995.  The Court
concluded that an initiative measure is &quot;enacted&quot; when an elections
officer tabulates the votes and certifies that a majority of voters approved the
proposed measure, so that elections are not prohibited.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Kinney v. O'Connor, Lake County I</B><BR>	The ACLU of Oregon filed this
pre-election challenge to a local OCA measure.  The challenge incorporates the
arguments against HB 3500 that the ACLU made in <I>Boytano v. Klamath Falls</I>.
 Lake County Circuit Court rejected the challenge, upholding the measure and
certifying it for the ballot.  The ACLU appealed the decision to the Oregon
Court of Appeals; oral arguments took place June 21, 1995.  In December 1995,
the Court of Appeals decided that &quot;[a] measure's potential substantive
invalidity will not prevent it from being placed on a local ballot.&quot;  The
ACLU then filed a motion to reconsider in the Court of Appeals based on the
court's decision in <I>Boytano v. Klamath Falls</I>.  In February 1996, the
Court of Appeals ruled that HB 3500 does not prohibit counting votes.  In May
1996, the Oregon Supreme Court denied the ACLU's petition for review.</P>

<P><B>Ladehoff et al. v. Keisling I and II</B><BR>	The ACLU filed a
pre-election challenge to the anti-gay &quot;Grandson of 9&quot; measure (named
for its resemblance to 1992's Measure 9) which was slated for the 1996 November
general election.  The ACLU argued that the proposed constitutional amendment
did not qualify as a proper subject for the initiative because of the numerous
substantive defects.  The OCA notified the Secretary of State that it did not
intend to pursue action on this proposed initiative.  </P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Rose et al. v. Keisling</B><BR>	The ACLU filed a pre-election challenge
to the eight anti-gay constitutional amendment proposals targeted for the

proper subjects for the initiative because of the numerous substantive defects. 
In October 1995, the trial court judge dismissed the ACLU's complaint because of
Lowe v. Keisling, the ACLU's unsuccessful challenge of Measure 13.  The ACLU
filed an appeal with the Oregon Court of Appeals in December 1995.  The case is

<P><B>Carver et al. v. Marion Co.</B><BR>	The ACLU of Oregon filed a
post-election challenge to Measure 24-5, the anti-gay OCA measure passed by
Marion County voters in March 1994.  The ACLU's complaint included the HB 3500
argument as well as numerous other constitutional claims.  The ACLU requested a
stipulated judgment that the measure would not be enforced.  The County filed a
motion for summary judgment; the ACLU responded with its own motion on September
21, 1995.  On November 6, 1995, Marion County Circuit Court judge Pamela
Abernathy ruled that Measure 24-5 violates the provisions of ORS 659.165 (HB
3500) and is thus null and void.  The judge permanently enjoined Marion County

from enforcing or implementing the measure.  The ACLU was awarded modest
attorney's fees.</P>

violently assaulted by the Los Angeles Police Department in November 1991, at a
demonstration protesting the veto of a bill that would have prohibited
employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in California.  After
Mackler and others were pushed and jabbed with police batons, Mackler (who was
wearing a &quot;National Coming Out Day&quot; T-shirt) asked, &quot;What's his
badge number?&quot;  The officer who was pushing Mackler responded by lifting
his baton above his head and hitting Mackler with the baton, knocking him to the
ground and breaking his eyeglasses.  Mackler was then grabbed by two other
officers who lifted him from the ground and threw him.  The Police left Mackler
lying on the ground injured.  The case is slated for trial in January of 1997.</P>

Governor Wilson's veto of a bill that would have prohibited sexual orientation
employment discrimination in California.  Over 100 police officers on horseback
and on foot, wearing full riot gear, charged the demonstrators, repeatedly
beating and trampling them, finally chasing them through the Century City
shopping center mall, where further police assaults took place.  Throughout,
many officers shouted slurs.  An estimated 60-90 day jury trial has been

were physically attacked without provocation by three Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents after a minor traffic mishap.  Throughout the assault, the
DEA agents called the men faggots and made various other homophobic comments. 
Grubb and Anderson suffered serious injuries.  Anderson was arrested and charged
with resisting arrest and harassment.  Grubb was arrested and charged with
harassment, obstruction of government administration, leaving the scene of an
accident, and operating a vehicle without a license.  All of these charges were
later dropped.  Anderson and Grubb sued the three agents in federal district
court for violation of their constitutional rights.  In April 1995, a jury
convicted the agents and awarded Anderson and Grubb $111,000 in damages.  The
government appealed.  While the appeal was pending, the government agreed to

<P><B>Curran v. Mt. Diablo Council of Boy Scouts</B><BR>	This lawsuit filed
by the ACLU of Southern California challenges the Boy Scouts' policy excluding
gay men and lesbians.  Tim Curran, a former Eagle Scout, charges that the policy
violates the Unruh Civil Rights Act, a California law which prohibits arbitrary
discrimination by businesses.  The complaint was originally dismissed, but the
Court of Appeals reversed and sent the case back for trial.  The Superior Court
held a two-phase trial.  In November 1990, it ruled that the Boy Scouts were

subject to the Unruh Act.  But in May 1991, it found that the Scouts have a
constitutional right to exclude open lesbians and gay men in order to further
its asserted goal of teaching Scouts that homosexuality is immoral.  The Court
of Appeals upheld that decision, 2-to-1, in 1994.  The California Supreme Court
granted the ACLU's petition for review, but the Court deferred briefing pending
decision of <I>Warfield v. Peninsula Golf and Country Club</I>, a gender
discrimination case in which the ACLU of Southern California is also counsel.

Department of Human Rights on behalf of two gay men who wished to serve as scout
leaders, alleging that the Boy Scouts' policy of excluding gay men from serving
as adult leaders violates the D.C. Human Rights Act's prohibition of
discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment and in access to places
of public accommodation.  After lengthy administrative proceedings, the
Department ruled in April, 1995 that it had no jurisdiction over the cases
because the Boy Scouts are not a &quot;place of public accommodation&quot;
covered by the Human Rights Act, and because a volunteer is not an &quot;employee&quot;
within the meaning of the Human Rights Act, and the only paid Boy Scout
employment positions in this area are in Maryland.   We sought reconsideration
of that decision, and in May 1996, the Department agreed to reopen these cases.

<P><B>Dale v. Boy Scouts of America</B><BR>The ACLU of New Jersey and the
Lesbian and Gay Rights Project filed an amicus brief challenging the Boy Scouts'
policy of excluding gay men and youths from membership.  The brief argues that
the Boy Scouts is a public accommodation and that New Jersey's Law Against
Discrimination requires that the Scouts treat all individuals equally, without
regard to sexual orientation.  It also disputes the Boy Scouts' claim that the
constitutional right to freedom of association exempts the Boy Scouts from
compliance with state civil rights laws.</P>
<P>	The Law Division judge granted the Defendant's motion for summary judgment,
 and dismissed all of Dale's claims.  In a disappointing, and homophobic
opinion, the Judge held that the Boy Scouts were not a public accommodation
within the meaning of New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination, and held that
even if they were, application of the LAD to them would violate their free
expression rights, since he believed that they were a private organization
established to express certain &quot;moral&quot; principles which he viewed as
incompatible with homosexuality.</P>
<P>	Dale has appealed to the Appellate Division, and the ACLU-NJ and the

<P><B>Orthodox Presbyterian Church v. Florio</B><BR>	The Orthodox
Presbyterian Church (OPC) is suing the State of New Jersey over provisions of
the Law Against Discrimination (LAD) which bans discrimination based on sexual
orientation.  The OPC argues that prohibiting discrimination against gays and
lesbians in employment and business transactions violates its right to free
exercise of religion and free speech.  In April 1992, the OPC's motion for a
temporary restraining order against enforcement of LAD was denied.  The Third
Circuit affirmed the denial and the State moved to dismiss the complaint,
arguing plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue the challenge in federal court. 
The ACLU of New Jersey submitted a friend of the court brief arguing that,
although the ACLU supports the broadest possible right of access to the courts
for resolution of constitutional claims, under the facts of this case the OPC
did not present a real case or controversy as required by Article III of the
federal Constitution.  </P>
<P>	The District Court dismissed the case, plaintiffs once again appealed and
the Third Circuit upheld the District Court's ruling with regard to the
organizational plaintiffs, but found that the one plaintiff who filed suit in
his individual capacity had standing.  The ACLU submitted a letter brief to the
District Court supporting the constitutionality of the ban on sexual orientation
discrimination.</P>
<P>	On remand, the District Court held that Rev. Cummings, the individual
plaintiff, had abandoned his challenge to much of the statute.  With respect to
the remaining portions, the court held that the challenge to requirement that
covered entities to display notices of individual's rights under the law was not
ripe, because no regulations had been issued, and held that the facial challenge
to the aiding and abetting sections failed because they regulated conduct, not
speech.  Finally, the court abstained from reaching the as-applied challenge, on
the ground that the state law on the issue was unsettled.  The plaintiff had
appealed to the Third Circuit.</P>

Sexual Conduct&quot; statute.  The statute criminalizes any sexual contact
between members of the same sex.  Plaintiffs -- six lesbian and gay Montanans --
brought suit in 1993, claiming that the statute violated their constitutional
privacy, dignity and equal protection rights.  In February of 1996 the trial
court judge ruled in plaintiffs' favor.  On appeal, the State argues that
plaintiffs do not have a sufficient interest in the case and that, in any event,
the statute promotes morality, deters inappropriate sexual conduct and reduces
the spread of AIDS.  The amicus brief explains to the court that lesbians and
gay men have the right to challenge the statute since they are targeted by it
and that the statute violates their right to equal protection of the law since
it is grounded in animosity toward lesbians and gay men.  The amicus brief will
be filed in Fall 1996 and the case set for argument thereafter.</P>

that the law was an unconstitutional violation of the right to privacy as it
applied to heterosexuals.  Cooperating attorney Mark Henricksen argued the case
before the Court of Criminal Appeals in August of 1995 and attempted to convince
the Court that the right to privacy applies to all Oklahomans, regardless of

punishment but is, instead, akin to putting a kid in a candy store, and the
court's decision that the jury could use a 1970 consensual sodomy conviction as
proof of future dangerousness.  Also at issue are allegations that the defense 
attorney slept through important parts of the trial; and that while on death

<P><B>Ross v. Department of Health and Hospitals</B><BR>	Ross was employed by
the City and County of Denver.  When her life partner was injured in an
accident, she took off three days to be with her.  She requested the days be
treated as sick leave under a policy that allows employees to use sick leave to
care for immediate family members.  The City refused to consider a lesbian or
gay life partner an &quot;immediate family member,&quot; despite a personnel
policy that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  Ross
appealed the refusal to the Denver Career Services Board in October of 1991,
where she prevailed.  The Hearing Board reopened the case, however, and reversed
itself.  Ross filed a complaint for review in court.  The trial court ruled in
favor of Ross, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  The Colorado Supreme Court
denied a petition for review.  Ross is currently working with the ACLU in an
attempt to change the agency's definition of &quot;immediate family&quot;

<P><B>American Association of University Professors v. Rutgers University</B><BR>	The

brought this suit against the school and the State Health Benefits Commission. 
The suit challenges the school's refusal to provide domestic partners the
benefits that are given to the spouses of heterosexual employees.  The suit
alleges that this practice violates the New Jersey law against discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation, a state executive order prohibiting
discrimination in the provision of benefits on the basis of sexual orientation,
a similar policy adopted by Rutgers, a provision of the collective bargaining
agreement prohibiting discrimination, and the State Constitution.  In February
1994, the Superior Court ruled that the claims as to the State are in the nature
of an appeal of a state administrative agency's ruling and transferred those 
counts to the Appellate Division.</P>
<P>	This suit is still pending in the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate

<P><B>Housley v. San Diego Lesbian &amp; Gay Pride</B><BR>	San Diego Lesbian
and Gay Pride, Inc. sponsors San Diego's annual Lesbian and Gay Pride Parade and
Festival.  In early 1994, former San Diego mayor Roger Hedgecock and a group of
supporters -- calling themselves the &quot;Normal People&quot; -- declared their
intention to march in the 1994 parade &quot;in political disagreement to the
homosexual agenda.&quot;  Pride rejected &quot;Normal's&quot; application and &quot;Normal&quot;
then filed suit in San Diego Superior Court, alleging that the exclusion was
based on its members' heterosexual orientation -- in violation of San Diego's
Human Dignity Ordinance.  </P>
<P>	The ACLU of San Diego &amp; Imperial Counties, in conjunction with Lambda
Legal Defense and Education Fund, defended Pride.  Pride argued that &quot;Normal
People&quot; was excluded because its message was antithetical to the message of
the Pride parade, not because of sexual orientation, and pointed to the hundreds
of heterosexuals (including the mayor and the police chief) who had been invited
to march.  Pride's First Amendment rights of speech and association would be
violated, we argued, if the Court required that their parade include avowed
opponents who sought to dilute Pride's message.  The Superior Court agreed, and
denied &quot;Normal's&quot; application for an emergency order, and the Parade
went forward as scheduled without &quot;Normal.&quot;  &quot;Normal&quot;

<CENTER>
<H5>California</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Smith v. FEHC</B><BR>	In California, the Fair Employment and Housing
Act expressly prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of marital
status.  Uniformly, courts have held that this prohibition includes a ban on
housing discrimination against unmarried couples.  Nevertheless, a landlord
refused to rent an apartment to an unmarried couple on the basis of her
religious belief that having a sexual relationship outside of marriage was
sinful.  The Fair Employment and Housing Commission found that the landlord had
violated state anti-discrimination laws.  </P>
<P>	The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the free exercise clause of
the state and federal constitutions protected the landlord's refusal to rent. 
On April 9, 1996, the California Supreme Court held that the fair housing law
protected unmarried co-habitating couples from discrimination and that the free
exercise clause did not exempt the landlord from complying with
anti-discrimination laws.  The ACLU and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith filed amicus briefs in support of the unmarried couple in the Court of
Appeals and the California Supreme Court.  </P>

<P><B>Gay and Lesbian Law Students Association v. University of Connecticut 
Law School</B><BR>	In May of 1992, the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project and the
Connecticut Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of the University of
Connecticut Gay and Lesbian Law Students Association against the University
seeking to bar the use of the School's employment recruiting services by
military recruiters.  The complaint alleged that the Law School's failure to bar
military recruiters violates the Connecticut Gay Rights Law, the Law School's
non-discrimination policy (which requires that all recruiters agree not to
discriminate), and a Connecticut law stating that military recruiters shall be
permitted on campus on the same terms as other employers.</P>
<P>	In October 1992, the court granted plaintiff's motion for a preliminary
injunction and barred the school from permitting the military to recruit on
campus.  This ruling marked the first time that a state court had ever barred
the U.S. military from recruiting on the basis that its actions discriminate
against lesbians and gay men.  In 1994, a final hearing was held to determine
the effect of the U.S. military's new policy on the injunction.  At that
hearing, the injunction was made permanent and the University then appealed to
the Connecticut Supreme Court.</P>
<P>	In a three-to-two decision, the Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed the
permanent injunction barring the University of Connecticut Law School from
permitting military recruiters on campus under the state gay rights law.  The
opinion has subsequently been applied by the Attorney General to bar the
military from career services at other state campuses.</P>

partner of five years participated in a private commitment ceremony, conducted
by a rabbi and attended by family and friends.  When the Attorney General found
out about the ceremony, he fired Shahar.</P>
<P>	The National Project, with the ACLU of Georgia and cooperating counsel
Debra Schwartz of Atlanta's Stanford, Fagan &amp; Giolito, sued in federal
court.  The suit argues the firing violates Shahar's rights to freedom of
religion, freedom of association, equal protection, and due process.  In October
of 1993, the district court granted the state's motion for summary judgment,
ruling that it would not have been unconstitutional for the attorney general to
have fired Shahar either for her sexual orientation, or the fact that she went
through the commitment ceremony.  </P>
<P>	In January, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit reversed the
trial court and reinstated Shahar's suit.  Lesbians and gay men, the court
ruled, have a right to intimate association just as others do, and the state may
infringe on the right only in the most compelling circumstances.  The Attorney
General petitioned the entire 11th Circuit court to rehear the case, which it
agreed to do.  The case has been re-briefed, and is awaiting oral argument.</P>

arguing that the D.C. Marriage Act should be interpreted, in light of the
prohibition against sexual orientation discrimination in the D.C. Human Rights
Act, to permit same-sex marriages.  In January, 1995, the Court of Appeals
upheld the trial court.  The court was unanimous in ruling that D.C. law did not
authorize same-sex marriages; one judge dissented from the grant of summary
judgment on the equal protection claim and would have remanded for fact-finding

violated the state constitutional rights to privacy and equal protection.  The
trial judge dismissed the case, ruling that the marriage ban was a valid way to
promote the state's interest in procreation.  On appeal, the Lesbian and Gay
Rights Project and the ACLU of Hawaii with assistance from the ACLU of Northern
California, filed a friend of the court brief in support of the plaintiffs in
the Hawaii Supreme Court.</P>
<P>	In a landmark decision, the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed the trial court
and sent the case back.  Because the law makes one's ability to marry dependent
on gender, the court said, the ban constituted sex discrimination.  Under the
Hawaii constitution, the court said, sex discrimination is as suspicious as race
discrimination.  The state can engage in it only if it has a compelling goal and
there is no other way to achieve the goal.  The high court sent the case back to
the trial court with instructions to the lower court to apply the strictest
constitutional standard in assessing the constitutionality of the ban.</P>
<P>	The case went back to trial in September, 1996, and the trial lasted two
weeks.  The ACLU plans to file a friend of the court brief, and to stay with the
case if, as expected, it returns to the Hawaii Supreme Court.  The bulk of the

<P><B>Various Same-Gender Marriage and Domestic Partnership Bills</B><BR>	Just
before the 1996 legislative session started, the Hawaii Commission on Sexual

found that there was no compelling state interest to deny the right to marry to
same-sex couples and that the denial of same-sex marriage was a violation of
equal protection of the law.  As a result of this finding, the Commission's
majority recommended that the State Legislature amend the law to allow same-sex
marriages or, in the alternative, to enact a statewide and comprehensive
domestic partnership law.  The ACLU publicly supported both of these findings
and recommendations.</P>

College.  Plaintiff brought suit in U.S. District Court against the Secretary of
Defense alleging that her discharge (1) constituted an equal protection
violation under the Fifth Amendment, and (2) violated her right to privacy under
the First, Fourth, and Ninth Amendments.  The U.S. District Court held plaintiff

required the Defendants to reinstate her in the military, and held that the
regulation mandating separation from the service based on homosexual status or
statements was unconstitutional.  The Defendants have appealed.  The ACLU of

<P><B>G.K. &amp; L.J.</B><BR>	Two lesbians in an 18-year relationship each
have a child conceived through artificial insemination.  Both wanted to adopt
the child of their partner.  The court dismissed their joint adoption petitions
since the couple was not married.  The women filed a notice of appeal.  The
Colorado Attorney General's Office entered the case and is aggressively arguing
the constitutionality of the statute and the inability of same sex partners to
adopt.</P>
<P>	In September 1995, the ACLU filed an amicus brief on the
unconstitutionality of the adoption law.  In October 1995, counsel for the women
withdrew, and the ACLU, through cooperating attorney Kathy Pek of Holme, Roberts
&amp; Owen, took over their representation.  In June 1996, the Colorado Court of
Appeals ruled that a lesbian couple cannot adopt each other's children, that
under state law the couple must be married to make such adoptions, and that
Colorado does not recognize same-sex marriages.  The women have filed a Petition

mother in a lesbian couple from adopting their three-year-old son.  The case was
referred to the Connecticut Adoption Review Board for a waiver of the statutory
requirement that parental rights of the biological mother be terminated before
an adoption can proceed.  The case is now before the Adoption Review Board.</P>

stay with the plaintiff only on condition that the plaintiff sleep in the same
room as her daughter, in a separate bed, and that the plaintiff's partner sleep
in a separate room with the door closed.  The plaintiff believed the arrangement
violated her right to privacy.  The ACLU of Florida represented the mother.  A

<P></P>
<P><B>Cox v. HRS</B><BR>	The ACLU of Florida and the Project represented a
gay man who sought to adopt a special-needs child.  Cox was denied the
opportunity to apply because of a Florida statute which says that &quot;no
person eligible to adopt under this statute may adopt if that person is a
homosexual.&quot;  In 1991, Cox filed suit challenging the constitutionality of

this section.  The trial court entered summary judgment, concluding that the
statute violated the Florida constitution.  The second district Court of Appeals
reversed and upheld the statute.  The decision was appealed to the Florida
Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court ruled that a more complete record was
necessary in order to determine the constitutionality of the statute under the
equal protection clause of the Florida Constitution.  The court affirmed the
district court's decision upholding the statute under Florida's right to privacy
and due process.  The court remanded the case for further proceeding in the
trial court.  Mr. Cox, however, decided not to pursue the case, and he filed a
motion for voluntary dismissal.</P>

<H5>New Jersey</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>In The Matter of the Adoption of 2 Children by H.R.</B><BR>	In 
September 1994, a New Jersey Superior Court judge denied H.R.'s application to
legally adopt her partner's two children as a co-parent.  Both children were
conceived through artificial insemination.  The trial judge denied the adoption,
on the ground that the statute required terminating the parental rights of the
biological parent unless the new parent was a spouse of the biological parent. 
The ACLU of New Jersey filed an amicus brief on appeal, arguing that the lower
court's ruling violated both the New Jersey constitution and statutory law, and
was contrary to the best interests of the children.  The New Jersey Superior
Court, Appellate Division, held that New Jersey's adoption statute permitted
same sex partner adoptions.  In a precedent setting opinion that is binding
state-wide, the Appellate Division held that the statute had to be read broadly
so as to promote the best interests of the child, which precluded limiting
co-parent adoptions to legal spouses.  Professor Annamay Sheppard of Rutgers Law
School was the cooperating attorney.</P>

<H5>New York</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>In Re Dana</B><BR>	In a very important precedent setting decision, New

to be served by denying the child a legal relationship with both of her parents.
 The Project filed an <I>amicus</I> brief on behalf of the partner.  It argued
that New York's adoption law should be interpreted to allow the unmarried
partner of a biological mother to adopt without affecting the legal relationship
between the biological mother and the child.  It also discusses constitutional
problems that would arise if the court came to the contrary conclusion, allowing
children of married couples to have two legal parents whereas other children
cannot.  </P>

ACLU of Virginia represent Sharon Bottoms in her fight to regain custody of her
son.  Ms. Bottoms' son was taken away from her by her mother because Ms. Bottoms
is a lesbian.  The Virginia Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision
awarding custody to Ms. Bottoms' mother in a strong opinion which said that
sexual orientation had no place in custody determination.  That decision was
unfortunately reversed by the Virginia Supreme Court, which ruled that being gay
means that a person is generally unfit to parent.  A new trial court proceeding
has been filed based on &quot;changed circumstances&quot; to try and reunite
Sharon and her son.  In February 1996, Henrico County Juvenile and Domestic
Relations Court, refused to restore custody.  A hearing was scheduled for August
1996, but the plaintiff has decided to discontinue the litigation.</P>

<P><B>Stevana Case, et al. v. Unified District No. 233, Johnson County, Kansas</B><BR>	On
November 29, 1995, the Federal District Court in Kansas City, Kansas, ruled in
favor of ACLU plaintiffs from the Olathe, Kansas school district who had filed
suit to protect against censorship by the school district.  The superintendent
and school board members of the district removed copies of <I>Annie On My Mind</I>,
a lesbian-themed national book award novel, from the shelves of the school
libraries in the district.</P>
<P>	When the school district refused to return the book, the ACLU filed suit. 
During the 1995 trial, the school board president testified that homosexuality
is a mental disorder that leads to a destructive life and is a sin.  Although
the district claimed it removed the book because it was &quot;educationally
unsuitable,&quot; the judge ruled the district had removed the book because it
disagreed with ideas expressed in it. </P>
<P>	The court ordered the return of the book to the Olathe public school
libraries by January 2, 1996.  The school district did not appeal.  The
volunteer attorneys handling the case for the affiliate were David J. Waxse, J.
Eugene Balloun, and John Bullock from the Kansas City area law firm of Shook,

military's entire new policy, Lambda and the ACLU bring a lawsuit in federal
court on behalf of six lesbian and gay servicemembers.  Their suit, Able v. USA,
is filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.</P>
<P><B>April 4, 1994</B> -- Federal District Judge Eugene Nickerson grants the
plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction, preventing the military from
initiating discharge proceedings against any of the six plaintiffs while the
case is active.</P>
<P><B>January 3, 1995</B> -- A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals
upholds Judge Nickerson's preliminary injunction and directs the trial court to
issue a final ruling in the case by March 31, 1995.</P>
<P><B>March 13-16, 1995</B> -- Four-day trial takes place in Able v. USA.  The
ACLU and Lambda call six witnesses to testify that the military's ban
discriminates against lesbians and gay men solely to placate the perceived
biases of heterosexual troops.  The government calls no witnesses.</P>
<P><B>March 30, 1995</B> -- Judge Eugene Nickerson strikes down anti-gay ban
as unconstitutional under the First and Fifth Amendments, and rules that the law
violates freedom of speech, calling it &quot;Orwellian&quot; and &quot;inherently
deceptive.&quot;  Government announces it will appeal.</P>
<P><B>December 19, 1995</B> -- Oral argument to panel for the Second Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals is deferred as Justice Guido Calabresi recuses himself in

argument on government's appeal of district court's holding that &quot;Don't
Ask, Don't Tell&quot; is unconstitutional.</P>
<P><B>July 1, 1996 </B>-- The Second Circuit neither upholds or strikes down
the military's ban, but sends the case back to Judge Nickerson to examine the
unequal treatment of lesbian and gay service members.  The federal appeals court
held that the lower court erred in focusing only on free speech. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<center><h1>Transcript of Substantive Plenary V<br>
 Racial Equality</center></h1>
<blockquote>
MR. WARE:  Thank you, Rosetta, and I
    would like to thank you all for hanging in there.
    It's been a pretty long day and I know you must be
    feeling a little bit exhausted.  But I think this
    is a very important plenary, certainly very
    important to me because I think it's not an
    overstatement to say that the state of race
    relations in America in 1995 is headed in a
    direction that was reached in 1895, one year before
   Plessy v. Ferguson was decided which, in turn,
   erected an elaborate system of racial segregation
   in America.<p>

              Just a couple of days ago, in a meeting
   with a group of black journalists, the speaker of
   the House, Newt Gingrich, suggested that
   African-Americans should look inward for the
   resolution of our problems.  If we are denied
   mortgages because of redlining and other
   discriminatory practices, we should not seek
   redress in the courts.  Instead, we should organize
   our own credit union so we won't have to rely on
   the lending institutions that violate federal law.<p>


              Now, if that is not a call for
   resegregation, I don't know how we should interpret
   the untenured professor from Georgia now.<p>


           The U.S. Supreme Court is no less
    cynical and condescending.  In Adaran Construction
    v Penia, the affirmative action case decided just a
    few days ago, the court held that the standard
    applies to affirmative action programs established
    by the federal government.<p>


               I think I need to remind everybody that
    these programs were intended to break down
    discriminatory barriers.  However, the court was
   concerned that the 10 percent of the contracts
   reserved for disadvantaged businesses might unduly
   limit the competitive opportunities of white
   males.  The remaining 90 percent was not an
   equitable share.  The majority was concerned that
   innocent white males would suffer diminished
   opportunities.<p>

              Now, it does not matter that Adaran
   never hired a minority worker or a contractor with
   a minority company.  It does not matter that Adaran
   benefits from an old boy network of white males
   from which blacks and women are excluded.  The
   government can't act to break down these barriers
   because it might result in a white-owned company
   losing a contract.  The majority ignored years of
   precedent, overruled the one precedent that it did
     not ignore, and to quote from the dissent, it
  cannot tell the difference between a no-trespassing
   sign and a welcome mat.<p>

             And finally, speaking for the forces of
  what I don't know, Justice Clarence Thomas declared
   that affirmative action was stigmatizing to
    African-Americans.  I wish he would speak for
    himself.<p>

               Now, the affirmative action defeat,
   Adaran, was coupled with a blow against equal
   education in the Missouri school segregation case
   decided the same day.  Speaking next will be Julius
   Chambers, who in the late 1960s persuaded a very
   different Supreme Court that states should be
  obligated to eliminate all vestiges of segregation,
  root and branch.  This formally changes the
   standard and alters that to the extent
   practicable.<p>

              It does not matter that schools are
   still segregated and black children are still
   receiving separate and demonstrably unequal
  educational opportunities.  That would, said the
   majority view, would be attributable to societal
 discrimination, rather than by the actions taken by
  any local school boards, and is therefore
    irrelevant.<p>

               The decisions in these cases and the
    attitudes of political leaders like Newt Gingrich
    makes the agendas of those in power clear.  Race
    and gender equality has never been an aspect of
    American society and those in power are intent on
    keeping that great American tradition intact.<p>

               Now, the ACLU is committed to race and
    gender equality, and it is one of the few
 organizations that is attempting to promote equal
   protection under the law, and it is in a unique
   position to commit its vast resources to protecting
   these principles in the courts and in the
   legislature.<p>

              The ACLU could, as some would prefer,
   limit its efforts to freedom of speech and freedom
  of religion, or it can redouble its efforts to
   advancing equality.  But I submit to you that
   speech, free speech and religion cannot be
   exercised if liberty and equality do not exist.<p>

             So I hope that the national organization
   and all of the affiliates and chapters will
   recognize this as you set your agendas for the
   upcoming year.  Thank you very much.<p>

              We will now hear from Julius Chambers
   and we will hear from all of the speakers and then
    at the end we hope that we will have time to take
    questions from the audience.  Thank you very much.<p>

               MR. CHAMBERS:  Thank you, Professor Ware
    and thank you, members of the ACLU.<p>

               Some years ago I served as a member of
    the national board of ACLU and began a relationship
    that has continued through today.  I worked with a
    number of your state members in North Carolina in a
  number of cases and I continue to work with the
   North Carolina Civil Liberties Union and I continue
   to pay my annual dues.<p>

              But you know, from those early
   experiences, I was asking myself, what am I going
   to talk to the ACLU about today?  You guys have
  read all the cases, you know all of the legislation
   and you know everything that's going on even in the
   area of civil rights.  I did remember, however,
   some years ago, Justice Marshall, shortly before
  leaving the bench, talking about how civil
   liberties and civil rights were intertwined and
   where there was retrenchment in one area, there was
   also retrenchment in the other and one can't expect
  to pursue one without the other.<p>

              I also remember an experience that I had
    during the riots in central Los Angeles that
    brought home to me how divided we are in America.
    For some years, as director-counsel of the Legal
    Defense Fund, I had been trying to build a closer
    relationship with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense
    Fund, the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund and
    the Asian-American, and I thought we had
    established a rapport and that we understood each
    other.<p>

              Well, to some extent lawyers did
   understand each other, but I have not gotten over
   yet the division that I saw in several meetings we
   had trying to build a better relationship.
  Somewhere along the line we developed more lack of
   trust in each other.<p>

              I also remember experiences here in New
   York where we were talking about the congressional
  districts and the Hispanics were demanding more
   congressional seats and African-Americans were not
   willing to relinquish a seat.  There were four
  African-American congressman and one Hispanic, and
   in order to increase Hispanic representation, we
   would lose an African-American seat.  We didn't
  give it up then and I am not sure we will give it
   up in 1995 or 1996, and I remember experiences in
    Texas, the same kind of problem.<p>

              Then I went back home to North Carolina
    and began to note that the increasing division
    between blacks and whites.  I had lived in North
    Carolina eight and a half years before and thought
    we had begun to build a relationship that would
    make for a true America.  I was also smarting from
    comments of a very close friend of mine, Derrick
   Bell, who asked, look at what you have accomplished
   with all these years of civil rights litigation.
   Your schools are resegregated, you can't get a job
   like a white person, we are not enforcing
   Title VIII, we are now arguing about the
   constitutionality of Title II.  Everything you
   worked on where you thought you had accomplished
   something is now being wiped out.  And the races
   are just as divided today as they were when you
  started.  What have you accomplished?  And what can
   you tell young people about using the law to effect
   change and lasting opportunities among people?<p>

        It's a good question, isn't it?  I grew   up in North
    Carolina.  My father couldn't get a
   lawyer because no lawyer in North Carolina would
   represent a black person in suing a white person,
  and I decided at an early age to go to law school.
    I went to segregated schools and I know what it was
    like to try to get a job despite one's ability to
    perform.  I went to Chapel Hill, graduated, I am
    told, at the top of my class, and no law firm in
    North Carolina was prepared to hire a black
    lawyer.<p>

               North Carolina wasn't unique, because I
    will never forget going to Washington and having an
    interview with Covington & Burling, and being told
   when I walked in, we never have hired any colored
   boys.  That was my introduction, and I remember
   talking about Justice Marshall and Jack Greenberg
   in 1961 about how one might use the law to effect
   change.<p>

              And, you know, I became a disciple, a
   believer, and I set about using the law to effect
   change.  And we did.  Just look at it.  I came
   along after Brown v. Board of Education, when our
   U.S. Supreme Court was still reluctant to accept
   any other decision or case talking about
   implementing Brown.<p>

              I went through the same struggle as all
   of us in getting a court eventually to decide Green
   v. New King County Board of Education and I will
   never forget going through the struggle of
   Charlotte v. Mecklenburg Board of Education and
    being asked even by Justice Stewart, do you really
    think your clients want integration of the schools,
    because a black group during the argument tried to
    submit an amicus brief opposing busing and
    desegregation.<p>

               We prevailed in that case, and I know,
    going out of Swann, we saw integration going on in
    a number of schools throughout the South.<p>

              I also remember going through with
   lawyers all around the country with litigating
   Title VII, employment discrimination based on race
   or gender.  I remember the strategies that we went
   through, how we really worried whether the court
   would impose procedural rules that would permit one
   to litigate a case or whether the substantive rules
   the courts would adopt would permit one to
   establish a violation and what the court would
   finally do with remedies.  We made some progress.
   We got some remedies.  We opened up some
   opportunities.<p>

              I also remember going through the same
   trying moments with housing discrimination, with
   voting rights, and how we began with new ventures
   in health and in what we call environmental
   equity.<p>

               I was teaching a class at the University
    of Michigan about five years ago, and one of my
    students asked, if you had a chance to do it over
    again, would you do it?  Another tough question.  I
    began to see, in 1975, retrenchment by a Supreme
    Court that was setting the tone for how the court
    was cutting back on procedural rules and
    substantive rules and remedies that would affect
   everything we had been about, you and I.  And I
   began to worry.<p>

              Well, we don't have but a few minutes
   and then I understand we have questions.  I want to
   tell you, going through the decisions of the
   Supreme Court in the last four or five years have
   been trying.  It's as though the Supreme Court
   never heard of slavery and never heard of race
   discrimination.<p>

              Just read with me the court's decisions
   this term.  There is an assumption that since 1954
   we eliminated race and gender discrimination and it
   is incumbent on anybody who contends that there was
  race discrimination to go through again and prove
   there was race discrimination; and race
   discrimination agenda is not a group practice, it's
    an individual practice, so even if you prove all
    blacks and women were excluded, you are not
    entitled to a group remedy, you get only an
    individual remedy.<p>

               I read the Supreme Court's decision in
    Kansas City, and I couldn't help but ask, have we
    really reversed Brown v. Board of Education?  What
    do I tell the students now in Charlotte-
    Mecklenburg, where we are resegregating the
   schools?  Or students in Durham, North Carolina,
   where a group of white parents just filed a lawsuit
   to enjoin desegregation of city schools because any
   desegregation order would have to consider race,
   and you can't consider race unless you have a
   legitimate reason for doing so; and even if you
   consider race and have a legitimate reason,
   whatever remedy you impose has to measure the
   violation you established, and certainly
   reassigning students on the basis of race is in
   excess of whatever constitutional violation one
   might find.<p>

              I remember Norfolk, Virginia, where we
   resegregated the schools because we wanted
   neighborhood schools, and I watched 60 and 70 and
   80 percent of young black children dropping out of
    school, and that would finish them.  Do we worry
    about it?<p>

               I also remember testifying in Congress
    and listening to congresspeople indicate this
    belief that race discrimination doesn't continue to
    exist in 1995, and wondering why one would be there
    talking about school desegregation, employment
    discrimination, housing discrimination.  And if one
    extended it to discrimination against the poor,
   they would be equally as appalled.<p>

              I gave that brief history because I want
   to conclude suggesting something to my brothers and
   sisters at ACLU.  Back in the 1930s lawyers got
   together and began to map strategy on how they
   would encourage the U.S. Supreme Court to change
   this interpretation of equal protection.  It was a
   long struggle and they mapped strategy on how to
   achieve that objective.<p>

              In 1995, I think it is imperative for
   ACLU and other civil rights and other civil
   liberties groups to step back and map strategies
   anew.  We are not going to win this battle with the
   same approach we have taken over the years.  We
   just aren't going to convince this Court, and
   perhaps the one that follows.<p>

               I have argued for years that my reading
    of equal protection is not one where one is
    required to establish purpose and intent.  My
    reading of equal protection is not one where a
    court simply enjoins a discriminator from
    discriminating in the future.<p>

               I read the Civil War amendments or post
    Civil War amendments as imposing an affirmative
    obligation on the part of the federal government to
   ensure that all citizens are accorded equal
   protection of the law and I read the amendments as
   saying to the U.S. Government, you are obligated to
   go out and ensure that no citizen is deprived of
   equal protection because of race or gender or color
   or any other objectional feature.<p>

              That is my reading of the equal
   protection clause, and I know people differ, they
   ask me, where do you draw a line.  I don't care
   right now where you draw a line.  They ask me,
   where do you get affirmative obligation.  That's
   what I think the court will eventually hold.<p>

              How do you protect the poor?  The same
   way you protect black folks and women and other
   nationalities.  It is that kind of bold approach
   and strategizing that I think ACLU and other civil
  rights organizations must begin to address.<p>

               Our America is disintegrating along
    racial and ethnic lines.  We are disintegrating
    according to our economic status in life.  And we
    can talk about all of the civil liberties we want.
    Until we adopt a position and pursue it vigorously,
    ensuring a reading of the Constitution that will
    accord protection to all people, then we are
    barking up a hollow tree.  And I would urge you,
   like I have been urging the other civil rights
   organizations, to step back a moment and map a new
   strategy and map a new reading of the Constitution
   along the lines that I have suggested.  Thank you.<p>

              (Applause.)<p>

            MR. WARE:  We will now hear from
   Jonathan Kozol.<p>

              MR. KOZOL:  I am not going to be very
   much more cheerful, I am afraid.  I will try to
   be.<p>

              I don't need to tell anybody here that
  in terms of school segregation and inequality our
   nation is now in a situation very much like that of
   a hundred years ago, before Plessy.  It's obvious
   to everybody that our schools are separate and
   unequal.  I started in this profession years ago in
    Boston, just walked into a school, said I wanted to
    be a teacher, and I ended up teaching in a
    segregated Boston school, and like many young
    people in that hopeful era, I was convinced, you
   know, that within another generation, we would have
    that licked.  I thought, in another generation,
    this won't be an issue in America.<p>

               Well, in a horrible sense, that proved
    to be true.  It's not an issue now, it's accepted.<p>

              I guess what upsets me the most is that
   when I talk about the fact that our schools are
   still separate and unequal to white affluent
   audiences, even liberal audiences in New York, for
   example, people who live here in New York, I get a
  kind of aching weariness in them, a sense that, oh,
   we have heard all that, and somehow the sense that,
   we cared about that enough long ago, so we made the
   contribution.<p>

              There is also the illusion that caring
   about something for 20 or 30 years is the
   equivalent of doing something about that.  I am
  sorry to say I feel that, more amongst liberals in
   New York than in the ordinary mainstream of people
   in America, there is a kind of cynicism amongst the
   privileged in this city.<p>

             I sense it often when -- and I talked to
    journalists, I have a lot of friends in the press
    here, some of my college classmates, and I will
    say, why do people here, good, thoughtful people,
    why do they accept all of this, and he explains to
    me, well, it is compassion fatigue.<p>

               I guess you have heard that phrase,
    compassion fatigue, and that's why they, you know,
    they will walk over the bodies of beggars on the
   street.  That's why they will agree to let business
   groups round up the homeless and put them on the
   trains and ship them back to the ghetto, where they
   belong.<p>

              I repeat everything, everything that
   white privileged people tell me, I repeat to poor
   black people.  I consider that my job as a
   subversive intellectual, and my newest book, which
   is going to be published in the fall, I spent most
  of a year in the poorest congressional district in
   America, which is the South Bronx, right here in
   New York, in the poorest neighborhood in the South
   Bronx, and talked with a lot of children and
   parents.  The book is different than most books
   about the poor in that they don't spend most of
   their time telling me what is wrong with themselves
    but they spend a lot of time commenting on our
    society, on the privileged.<p>

               One of the ministers I met in the Bronx,
    one of the priests, said, in our society, the poor
    consider it a problem for the rich, and so the rich
    set up these think tanks and institutes to study
    the defects of the poor.  Now I am beginning to
    think, well, maybe it would be great to set up a
    think tank of the poor to study the defects of the
   rich to find out what their value problems are
   and -- I mean, I think, yes, the poor sometimes are
   a problem for the rich, but in this city, at least
   the rich are an infinitely greater problem than the
   poor, no question about it.<p>

              But anyway, I guess what upsets me most,
   is that even among my allies, the good folks,
   people I have worked with for years, some of them
   actually in power, some of them in the House of
   Representatives, in the Senate, many in fairly
   authoritative positions around the country, the
   entire dialogue about these issues is so low-key
   and muted.  It doesn't have enough energy, it
   doesn't have enough frenzy.<p>

              I would even go so far as to say it
  isn't apocalyptic enough to equal the amount of
suffering that is going on now.  What frustrates me
    is that the enemies, the spokespeople of the
    privileged, the Rush Limbaughs, the Newt
    Gingriches, they have plenty of energy, plenty of
    passion; the Pat Buchanans, they soar with elegant
    intensity, raw, vicious and mean, and they are not
    tired.<p>

               I read and reread Yates' lines, where
    they say the best lack all conviction.  It comes to
   mind every time President Clinton gives a press
   conference, every time.  I work for him, I like him
   very much, I like him personally, but why -- and
   our press, the centrist or liberal press in the
   country, to the extent there still are centrist or
   liberal papers, they often seem manacled by an
   enforced civility they will not call things by
   their right names.<p>

              In New York City, I cull the papers year
   after year.  I see the descriptions of the poorest
   neighborhoods I know.  They never call them
   ghettos.  The poorest segregated neighborhoods,
   they don't call them segregated.  Yes, they do in
   other parts of the country, but not in New York.
   They call them gritty neighborhood, hard-bitten
   neighborhood, low-income neighborhood populated by
  people called minorities, as if they were Albanians
    or something like that, and impacted communities.<p>

               One black man I know said I hate that
    word when I see that in the newspaper, impacted
    neighborhoods, it is like our black children are
    like so many teeth who came through the gums at a
    bad angle.  They should call things by their right
    names.<p>

               Most of you who are not from New York
   City, and I gather most of you are not, do
   something while you are here, something I do when I
   go to the South Bronx in New York, but go down to
   the subway train, right here at 42nd Street, or
   59th Street, get on the number 6 train, the number
   4, or the number 2 train heading north, and watch
   what happens.<p>

              For about six or eight stops, you will
   see people of all races together on the train.
   Then at 86th Street, most of the white people
   leave.  At 96th Street, all of the white people
   leave, except you, if you are still on the train.
   Then you will ride on into one of the largest
   ghettos in the western world, the combined ghetto
   of Harlem, Washington Heights, the South Bronx,
   which by the end of the century will constitute an
   almost uninterrupted ghetto the size of Houston,
    Texas.<p>

               I can't tell you anything about law,
    litigation, how to fight these cases; I don't know
    that.  But I can give you a sense briefly, for a
    couple of minutes, of what it is like, what it
    feels like now.  I have spent a lot of time, either
    in the schools or in the churches, where the
    children's mothers come to pray for their kids,
   where the kids come sometimes after school for
   food.<p>

              Let me describe some of the schools I
   see.  I see schools -- I think of a school in the
   South Bronx where there is so little money that
   when little girls go out to recess and jump rope --
   they do double-dutch.  Do you know what that is?  I
   love to watch it, I love to hear the rhymes the
   children make up, it is so beautiful.  But the
   school can't afford jump rope, so they give them
   cut-up pieces of TV cable to use in place of jump
   ropes.<p>

              This school is a classic New York
   segregated school.  Two thirds of the teachers of
   the school aren't certified.  They dump permanent
   subs into these schools.<p>

               Another school in the neighborhood, it
    is so crowded the children are having classes in
    urinals, they just take over a former bathroom.  Or
    coat closets without windows.  One teacher said,
    well, at least there is nothing to distract them,
    they can't look outside the window.  Closets and
    stair landings.<p>

               One famous high school in New York,
    Morris High School, which I wrote about in Savage
   Inequalities, just a monument to pedagogical
   apartheid in America, a huge school of 1,600 kids,
   and last year I think 80 children graduated,
   wherein it should have been 400 or 500.  A famous
   school where Colin Powell went, when it was an
   integrated school long ago.  He went back there a
   couple of years ago to give a talk.<p>

              This is part of this fatuous boosterism
   that is going on, where you had a segregated,
   unequal school but you send some black hero in to
   give the kids a talk, and sometimes it is
   wonderful, like with Jesse Jackson, it is really
  terrific, he says, kids, you are somebody, and they
   chant back, I am somebody, and he is really good.
   He has a wonderful, electric effect on the kids.<p>

              But the thing is, it is all for nothing,
   it doesn't work.  They can say it a hundred times,
    I am somebody, but everything about that school,
    that neighborhood, the physical stink of the
    school, the demographic composition of the school
    tells him, in the eyes of this society, you aren't
    anyone at all, and they get the message.<p>

               Colin Powell isn't that good a speaker,
    he is really boring, but he went there, gave the
    kids the typical sound bite speech, you know, told
   the kids don't use drugs, have good values, all
   those things.<p>

              A boy, part of the ritual for the TV
   cameras, the boy got up after his speech and gave
   him a trophy to show -- for Colin Powell -- how
   much his speech meant to him.  Ten months later,
   the boy who handed him the trophy was arrested for
   homicide.<p>

              One doctor I know in the South Bronx
   says that even when a charismatic person comes to
   speak to these kids, it is like walking into an
   intensive care ward in a leper colony and saying,
   rise.  He is right.<p>

              There is one school in The Bronx called
   Taft, 4,000 kids go there.  The school has broken
   down their self-respect so much -- I mean, I won't
    even describe it to you, I have written so many
   books about it it makes me sad to recapitulate the
    details, but you can imagine what it is like.  It
    is a horror house.<p>

               The kids, their self-respect has been
    broken down so much, they made a joke about the
    name of the school.  The kids tell me all these
    things.  The kids tell me what Taft stands for, it
    means Training Animals for Tomorrow.  That's what
   we have done to them, that they believe that now.<p>

              Last Christmas, I was visiting in the
   home of one of the families I am friends with in
   the South Bronx.  This is a wonderful family and I
   know the mother, who is a little younger than I am,
   a beautiful woman, wonderful woman, a black woman
   who has AIDS, she has had it for 12 years, she is a
   survivor, and her daughter, a lovely person, she is
  about 25, and her two children, and they live on a
   street where there were 21 murders in that block,
   21 murders in the past three years, just in that
   block.<p>

              The elementary school in the
   neighborhood ranks 625 out of 626 elementary
   schools in New York City in reading.  The school
   has 800 children, one white student out of 800.  A
   teacher at the school told me that when she had
    that white boy last year, she said, that's the
    first white student I have had in 18 years.  It's
    just like Mississippi 40 years ago, 50 years ago.
    No difference at all.  Except at least in
    Mississippi you could look out the windows and see
    the healing greenery of pretty countryside.  Here
    you look out the window at a homeless shelter in
    one direction and a sewage plant in the other.<p>

              These children have been so broken
   down.  They have a wonderful grandma and a
   wonderful mother.  But they are so demolished in
   their spirits.  I watched them pray on Christmas
   Eve, when they went into their bedroom, knelt down
   by the bed, and the beds are very low, almost near
  the floor; the people are afraid of having regular
   beds there, for fear of bullets coming through the
   window, and a lot of people have beds on the floor,
   so these people had low beds.  I heard them go in
   and pray, God bless Mommy, God bless Nanny.  God,
   don't punish me for being black.<p>

              I said to their mother, did you teach
   them that.  She said, of course not, I hate that
   when I hear them say that.  Where they learned it,
   they learned it from their friends.<p>

           The schools are only a small part of the
    picture for these children.  I encourage people to
    bring suits, equality suits, desegregation suits in
    the courts.  But it is a small part of the
    problem.  They have to rely on segregated
    hospitals, where they almost never see a white
    American doctor, or black American doctors either.
    One woman going to the hospital said to me, last
    time I was there, I had six different doctors, one
   was Pakistani, one was Korean, one was Philippine,
   one was from Haiti, Africa, and they are nice
   people, but I can't understand them, and she looked
   at them in amusement and she said, where are all of
   the doctors from America?<p>

              The same kids live in housing which is
   as bad as anything I saw in the rural South, in
   Tunica, Mississippi, 30 years ago.  I know of three
   children who died this year, two in household
   fires, because they were living in firetrap
   apartments, and one in the building where the
   elevator didn't work.  It had been broken for
   years.  Complaints were made, nobody ever did
  anything about it, and finally the door just opened
   one day and the boy fell three flights to his
   death.  These are little kids, innocent children.<p>

              A lot of these kids have asthma.  I
    mean, that is the least of their worries, in a way,
    I mean, this is a neighborhood where one in four
    women who come to obstetric wards are
    HIV-positive.  25 percent.  You can imagine the
    rate of pediatric AIDS in this neighborhood.  It is
    a neighborhood of AIDS orphans, dozens and dozens
    of children whose mothers and daughters have AIDS.
    The less apocalyptic things, ordinary things like
   asthma, I don't know if they are more interesting
   to me, or maybe I write about asthma because more
   people can identify with that.<p>

              You have a whole neighborhood where the
   kids carry a pump like this in their pockets.  I
   carry one.  I grew up in the home of a neurotic
   Jewish psychiatrist, a very typical upbringing for
   a Jewish kid, so naturally, I had asthma.  It went
   away completely when I went to Harvard, and it went
   away completely until I went back to the South
   Bronx.<p>

             It is a neighborhood where the kids feel
   everything is conspiring against them.  The city,
   yes, puts everything smelly and toxic in their
   neighborhood.  There is a waste incinerator right
   near their homes which was supposed to go in this
    part of Manhattan but it was stopped here because
    white families here recognized it posed a cancer
    risk, respiratory risk to their children, so they
    put that in The Bronx instead.<p>

               That might have something to do with it,
    that might be a good civil liberties case, I
    guess.  But I don't think you really need to look
    for a scientific explanation.  I mean, all you need
    to look at is the racism of some and the inequity
   of others to see where the kids can't get fit air
   into their lungs.  Some of them have it so bad they
   have breathing machines next to their beds, oxygen
   tents next to their beds.<p>

              I will not go on any longer other than
   to say my new book, which will be out in the fall,
   has a hopeful title, and I don't know how I came up
   with a hopeful title because I was so depressed,
   but I spent a lot of time in church, and I agree
   with the Civil Liberties Union that religion should
   be kept separate from the state.  But I have been
   forced by what I have seen this year to take
   religion very seriously.  In a way, I feel
   heartsick to see the way the right wing has sort of
   been able to seize God as their ally in America.<p>

              The poor children I know are very
   devout, they believe in God, their mothers believe
    in God.  They have to, they have nothing else.  I
    asked the group of kids in school, what is the most
    beautiful thing you can think of.  Every time, the
    answer is heaven.  They never say anything on
    Earth, they speak of heaven.<p>

               I asked one lovely little girl I am
    going to see tomorrow, I asked her, where is
    heaven.  She said, upstairs.  I asked her where is
   hell.  She said, downstairs.  Then I asked, how
   far.  All the way down.  Like somebody in Saks
   Fifth Avenue takes the elevator, they drive it all
   the way down.<p>

              She was so vivid about it, I asked her
   what is it like in heaven, what is it like in hell,
   and she said, in heaven, you wear nightgowns,
   white, because you are angels, and in hell, you
   wear red pajamas.  You don't pay for things in
   money in heaven, you pay for things with smiles,
   and she also said, if you have a dog you loved, the
   dog would go to heaven, too, which made me very
   happy, because at the time she told me, I was
   mourning for my beagle who had just died.  After
   she told me that, I spent a long time trying to
   picture Newt Gingrich in red pajamas.<p>

              The thing I wanted to say to you is, I
    know this isn't of any use to you as lawyers, but I
    never took, I never thought much about heaven and
    hell, for years.  Probably not since I was an
    infant, a child.  You know, I went to Harvard, we
    are sophisticated, you don't believe in things like
    that, or if you do, you are not supposed to talk
    about them.  But this year I have thought about it
    a lot.<p>

              I will tell you, I think about it a
   lot.  I hope there is a heaven.  I hope there is a
   heaven, because it is unbearable to think that what
   these kids are getting in America is all there is.
   This is unacceptable, life at that level isn't
   enough.<p>

              Well, I wish you good luck in court and
   I will do my best in church.  Thank you.<p>

              (Applause.)<p>

              MR. WARE:  Thank you, Mr. Kozol.  We
   will now hear from Karen --<p>

              AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Point of information,
   what is the hopeful title?<p>

              MR. KOZOL:  Oh, I never said it.  It's
   Amazing Grace.<p>

              MR. WARE:  We will now hear from Karen
        Narasaki.<p>

               MS. NARASAKI:  Good afternoon.  I suffer
    from a small minority, vertically challenged, so I
    try to stay away from the big podiums.  I hope you
    will excuse me.<p>

               It is a very great honor for me to
    participate in the ACLU's national convention,
    particularly with such a distinguished panel.
    There is a special link with the ACLU and the
   Asian-American community.  As many of you know, it
   was an ACLU attorney who brought the suit and
   defended Fred Koramatsu in the infamous Kormatsu v
   the United States, on the internment of the
   Japanese Americans, and it was the ACLU who stood
   with a number of civil rights organizations filing
   for redress of the Civil Liberties Act which
   finally passed in 1988.  They have understood that
   race, unfortunately, in America is very
   complicated.  It is not just black-white, in all
   senses of that word.<p>

              Now, I have enormous admiration for the
   attorneys who work for ACLU because I have learned
   over the last several years what it is like to try
   to defend unpopular causes or unpopular groups.  In
   the three short years that I have worked in
    Washington, Asian-Americans have dropped from being
    held up as the model minority to now the reason for
    every ill, as immigrants, that this country now
    faces.  I just went to a press conference yesterday
   that Lamar Smith held on the introduction of his
    immigration bill and one of the congressmen said,
   we could solve our problems with having to build so
    many prisons, we could solve our overcrowding in
   schools, we could solve all of our economic
   problems if we just stopped immigration.<p>

              Now, I was never fond of the model
   minority myth, but I have to say that it's
   beginning to look pretty good to me these days.
   The kinds of rhetoric that I hear today are really
  scarily, eerily reminiscent of what was being said
   when the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed back in
   the 1800s and what was being said right before my
   parents were sent to internment camps in the
   1940s.<p>

              I think the challenge for those of us
   who believe in America's ideals and who struggle to
  ensure that the communities we belong to actually
   realize the fruits of these ideals is to not allow
   ourselves to become divided.<p>

              Two years ago, when the anti-gay
   Colorado initiative was being pushed, I was very
   proud when the Asian-American community stood with
   the gay community because we were smart enough to
   realize that that was only the first step in a hate
   movement, the first attempt to pick off what was
    perceived as the most vulnerable of communities.<p>

               Then last year, as you know, it was
    Prop 187 in California, targeted Latino and Asian
    undocumented immigrants, another vulnerable
   community.<p>

              This year the march of hate has
  accelerated to a record pace because now they have
   declared war on legal immigrants a la the cuts in
   immigration and welfare reform and on all
   minorities and on women now, with the attack on
   affirmative action.<p>

             I wonder -- and unfortunately my talk
   will not be more cheerful than my predecessors -- I
   wonder who is going to be left standing, what group
   is going to be left surviving, what group will be
   deserving enough to be deserving of equality and
   justice in this country.<p>

              AUDIENCE MEMBER:  The Senate.<p>

              MS. NARASAKI:  I don't know.  I think I
   can picture them in red pajamas, too.<p>

              And if you don't believe all of us are
    in this together, let me read you some of the
    recent quotes out of the violence report for 1994.
    These are things that actually happened in 1994,
    and I apologize in advance for the language.<p>

               In 1994, when there was a Proposition
    187 flier that was being stuffed into mailboxes in
    LA, it read:  "We need a real border.  First we get
    the spics, then the gooks and at last we get the
   niggers.  Deportation.  They are all going home."<p>

              And in a campus bathroom in a
   Connecticut university, swastikas and a message
   purportedly signed by the KKK was scrawled on the
   wall.  It read, "minority women will be raped and
   murdered if blacks, Latinos and Asians refuse to
   leave the campus."<p>

             Now, in this atmosphere, here are just a
   few of the challenges that we are facing today.
  Immigration.  To put this in context as to why this
   is so important to the Asian-American community,
   you have to understand our history.  For well over
   75 years, Asians' immigration to the United States
   was either totally blocked or restricted.  Even
   after the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in
   the 1940s, immigration from China was at a level of
   105 persons per year at the same time when
    immigration from Germany was 20,000 per year.  It
    was not until 1965 that the racial premises of our
    immigration laws were dropped, thus starting the
    great wave both from Latin America and from Asia,
    both as refugees and as legal immigrants, and it
    has only been 30 years since immigration became
    race neutral, and again we face a racial battle
    ground.<p>

              Now, however, they don't have to
   expressly say, they don't have to exclude Chinese
   or Asians.  They just say, we don't want any
   immigrants, because the immigration stream for the
  last 20 years has been 80 percent Asian and
   Latino.<p>

             The 20 to 30 percent cuts being proposed
   in Congress would prevent 1.5 million Asians from
   joining their families in the United States.  To
   put that into context, our population here in 1995
   is about 9 million, so you can see the devastating
   effect that has on our community, and these are
   just individuals who have been on waiting lists for
  10 to 17 years.  We are talking about children, we
   are talking about parents, brothers and sisters.
   Somehow this Congress seems to have adopted the
   notion that when your child turns 21 they mean less
    to you, that they suddenly become a stranger that
    you have no responsibility to, no ties to, and they
    have no responsibility back to you.<p>

               I was talking to a New York Times
    reporter and I said, "you know, I just can't
    understand how someone who is a father or a mother
    or who has brothers and sisters can say that these
    family members just shouldn't be important to you.
   Don't they love their families?  I don't think it
   is just an Asian feature to love your children, to
   care about your brothers and sisters, to feel
   obligated and loved towards your parents."  He said
   to me, "Karen, it's not that they don't love their
   own children, they just don't love yours."<p>

              Some of the things in the bills, I
   think, even just from a straight civil liberties
   perspective is quite frightening.  Senator
   Simpson's bill which just got out of committee, was
   voted out of committee, says that if you represent
   someone who is not a citizen or a legal permanent
   resident -- it could be a foreign student, it could
   be anybody even lawfully here -- you will not be
   able to get attorney's fees and costs.  The court
   would not be able to award those simply because you
   are not a citizen or a legal permanent resident.<p>

               I think the intent of that is pretty
    clear.  It's a pretty glaring attempt to stop those
    of us who care about these communities from being
    able to make sure that their rights are protected
    in this country.<p>

               Now, you may be thinking to yourselves,
    why is she talking about immigration?  Well, I know
    this audience is not naive enough to know that the
   immigration debate is not about resources or the
   environment or our economy.  It's about race.<p>

              And as cynical as I have gotten working
   in Washington, even I was shocked to hear someone
   in an immigration reform commission hearing say
   that the decision that faced America was just how
   many tacos and chop suey did we really need, or to
   hear Senator Simpson's top aide tell me the reason
  he no longer supported family reunification was
   because he was promised it would not be Asians,
   that he was told it was for Europeans, and when we
   tried to explain to him, what is exactly the
   concern, because even with the 40 percent rate over
   the past few decades, the Asian Americans only make
  up 3 percent of the community, and that worldwide
   Asians make up 50 percent of the world population,
  just to try to explain, you know, that certainly
    3 percent seemed fairly modest, the aide turned to
    us and said, "You don't mean that you think this
    country should be 50 percent Asian?"  I thought he
    was going to fall off his chair.<p>

               Now, this anti-immigrant tide is flowing
    into every sector, unfortunately, for the
    community.  Education in general is under attack.
    They are going so far as to say they should wipe
   out the entire Department of Education.  One of the
   particularly targeted programs is bilingual
   education, even though studies show there is a
   direct correlation between poverty and the ability
   to adequately speak English.<p>

              One of the complaints about immigrants
   is they are not able to fluently speak English.
   Apparently they want to complain but they don't
   want to do anything about it.  These are the same
   people who support English-only laws, who support
   laws that would say to us, you can't have
   translators in courts because we don't want to hear
   anything but English in the courts, so if you
   happen to represent a defendant who doesn't speak
   English, too bad.  If you happen to need a crucial
   witness who does not speak English, too bad.<p>

         What kind of justice will we get in this
   country if that is the kind of attitude that this
   country is going to take?  These laws would also
   make it illegal to even serve, to provide
   government services in English, and would wipe out
   the voting rights assistance, the language
   assistance ballots in New York and in other
   cities.  It is so important for these non-English
    speaking people to exercise the right to vote.<p>

              Imagine a world where you could be fired
   or sued because you were speaking Chinese on the
   job.  That is already happening.  There are
   corporations who have laws that say you can only
   speak English as long as you are on the premises.
   It doesn't matter if your customer doesn't speak
   English that well, or if you could communicate
   faster in a different language.  They just don't
   want to hear anything but English, and in a world
   that is so global, that's becoming so globally
   dependent, it's just incredible to me that that's
   the direction that our nation seems to be heading
   in.<p>

              And I wanted to talk about access to
   government benefits because there my wildest
   nightmares have been exceeded.  Not only are we
  cutting off benefits to the undocumented, including
    undocumented children, including things like health
    care, we are cutting off aid to legal immigrants,
    many of whom have been here for 20, 30, 40 years,
    people who pay taxes, have served in the military
    -- and you may not be aware of this, but legal
    residents serve in the military at higher rates
    than citizens.  They could have done all of that
    but still be deprived of the safety net that this
   country enjoys, or what will be left of it after
   Newt and company are done with it.<p>

              The Senate would also now limit you,
   even after you become a citizen -- I could not
   believe this, when I saw the bill, and the change
   happened at the very last minute, and we called
   Senator Packwood and said, do you realize what you
   have just done?  It said that even if you become a
   citizen, you will still be limited.  You have now
   created two classes of citizenship in this country,
   something that we thought was over with the
   internment of the Japanese and the ending of at
   least legally recognized segregation.<p>

              The starkest irony of this attack is
   that Asian immigrants were prevented by law from
   becoming naturalized citizens until 1952 because --
  and this was actually upheld by the Supreme
    Court -- Justice Sutherland said that the reason
    you should uphold it is that the racial difference
    was of such character and extent that the great
    body of our people instinctively recognize it and
    reject the thought of assimilation.<p>

               Now, my grandmother was not allowed to
    become a citizen until after 1952.  That is within
    my parents' lifetime.  After all, that's less than
   45 years ago.  And yet now, the community is under
   attack as not being citizens.<p>

              This whole outflow is not only affecting
   Asians, Latinos and other immigrants, but it will
   soon be brought home to each and every one of us,
   with the introduction of the national ID card,
   which is gaining a lot of favor.<p>

              Senator Feinstein is one of the most
   enthusiastic proponents, going so far as to
   recommend that we encode retina scan information
   into our Social Security cards, and what is even
   scarier is that in a bill that passed that is part
   of Senator Simpson's bill that got out of
  committee, there is a provision that says that when
   your child is born, you must get a Social Security
   number for that child and that number must be made
   part of his or her birth certificate, and then,
   when the child turns 16, that child must go and get
    their fingerprints or a retina scan or some other
    identifier encoded into the birth certificate.<p>

               Obviously, the FBI and others are
    salivating at the idea of having everybody in this
    country fingerprinted and retina-scanned.  I don't
    know about you, but it is not a country that I want
    to be part of.<p>

              Voting rights, as you have heard, is
   also under attack in court and in the Congress, for
   Asians, Latinos, and Asian-Americans.  Section 203,
   which is the language provisions which have been so
   important in assuring that hundreds of thousands of
   minorities can exercise intelligently their right
   to vote, has been targeted specifically for repeal,
   which is particularly depressing to my community,
   because it was only three years ago that we
   successfully won an amendment to actually broaden
   it to cover effectively our communities.<p>

              Now we face a massive disenfranchisement
   of the many new citizens that are becoming
   naturalized.<p>

              Lastly, I want to talk about affirmative
  action.  Contrary to popular stereotypes, most
     Asians -- at least from the press, the ethnic press
    that I have been reading -- support affirmative
    action, yet we are being used by the media and
    others as an example of a group, of a minority
    group that does not support affirmative action.  I
    was particularly incensed when I read a New York
    Times article about Berkeley, the admissions
    program there, and they quoted Chancellor Ti-Yen, a
    prominent Chinese-American leader, and said his
   idea was outside of the norm, and then they quoted
   a 21-year-old college student and said that they
   represented the community.<p>

              Now, I don't know, but most communities,
   that is not the way, the recognition, the
   leadership usually works, and I thought it was a
   pretty blatant example of someone's preconceived
   ideas of where the community is coming from.  We
   are just as concerned about the loss of affirmative
   action, not only because of the discrimination that
   still persists against our own community, but we do
   not see a level playing field for other women and
   minorities.<p>

              Even more troubling to us is the general
  tack, the attempt to divide and conquer, to
   separate the Asian community out.  There are
   attempts in Washington to tell other minority
    communities, we should drop Asians because they are
    mostly immigrants and they don't need it, and yet
    then they hold up the Asians to the other
    minorities and say, well, Asians don't like it, so
    that's why we should drop it.  A very dangerous
    path to tread on.<p>

               We understand what this debate is all
    about.  It is an attempt by those still with the
   power in this country to hold on to it.  People ask
   me all the time, why is affirmative action being
   attacked, and I believe because it is doing
   precisely what it was meant to do, it's forcing
   white men to share the wealth.<p>

              Unfortunately, the pandering by
   politicans, especially those with presidential
   aspirations, to the fears and bigotries that
   unfortunately have never been far below the
   surface, have life-and-death consequences.<p>

              And I will give you a few examples
   before I close.  These are just incidents that
   happened in 1994.  An Asian-American man was
   stabbed by a white man in Sacramento, California.
   The attacker explained that he was just trying to
   defend our country.<p>

             A white man attacked an Asian-American
    man with a bat while yelling "You are in my
    country.  Get out, go back to your country.  This
    is America."<p>

               An Indian-American student in
    Pennsylvania was assaulted by a group of white
    youths who were yelling "Go home, fucking Iranian,
    you Asian shit, go home, foreigner."<p>

               We have a saying in the
   Japanese-American community called kodomo no tame.
   Literally translated, it means for the sake of the
   children.<p>

              Dr. Chambers is absolutely right.  We
   must all work together to overcome our differences,
   to build trust, because only in that way will we be
   able to defeat the tide of bigotry and fear that
   threatens to destroy the best of what our country
   has to offer:  Freedom, equality and justice.
   Thank you.<p>

              (Applause.)<p>

              MR. WARE:  I am afraid that we went over
   and we will not be able to take any questions
   because of the time lag and conflict with other
   panels, but I would like to thank you all for
   coming.

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The History of the ACLU Women's Rights Project</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In 1961 the Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Earl Warren, unanimously

upheld the constitutionality of a jury selection system that discriminated
against women on the grounds that &quot;women are at the center of home and
family life.&quot;  The observation reflected dominant social values at the
time, but the Court was unable then to see how such values thwarted the promise
of equality for women implicit in the Constitution.</P>
<P>A decade later, the newly established ACLU Women's Rights Project took the
case of Reed v. Reed to the Supreme Court, challenging the automatic preference
of men over women as administrators of estates.  Congress had already passed
statutes such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, barring some forms of sex discrimination, and the women's movement had
become recognized as a major political force.  In Reed, the Supreme Court saw
sex discrimination in a new light, and agreed with the ACLU.  For the first
time, the Court held that a classification based on sex was unconstitutional, in
violation of the equal protection clause.  </P>
<P>That legal breakthrough set the stage for the Women's Rights Project's
systematic effort over the next several years to urge the courts to treat sex
discrimination in the same constitutional terms as race discrimination, to
attack various forms of sex discrimination permitted by law, and to fashion
strategies to overcome practices which, even if they were not explicitly
sanctioned by the law, effectively denied true equality to women.</P>
<P>During those years, the ACLU Women's Rights Project was the major, and
sometimes the solitary, national legal arm of the growing movement for gender
equality.  It was widely recognized as &quot;'the' spokesperson of women's
interests&quot; in the U.S. Supreme Court, and the &quot;premier&quot;
representative of women's rights interests in that forum.(1)</P>
<P>In the two decades since, the Women's Rights Project has continued to occupy
a unique role within the women's movement.  While other groups, including other
ACLU units, have played major roles in political organizing, legislative
advocacy, and the struggle to preserve the right to choice, the ACLU Women's
Rights Project has been the principal group responsible for systematic legal
reform through the courts in the areas of women's equality and economic rights. 
It has been the role of the Women's Rights Project to articulate the principles
that persuade courts to utilize both the Constitution and federal statutes to
strike down legal barriers to full equality for women.  </P>
<P>Examples of such cases include the 1976 case of Craig v. Boren, in which the
Supreme Court established the &quot;heightened scrutiny&quot; standard for
measuring the constitutionality of sex-based classifications, and Califano v.
Goldfarb, in which the Supreme Court struck down discriminatory Social Security
regulations, finding that they were the &quot;accidental by-product of
(legislators') traditional way of thinking about females&quot;.  By the late
1970s, however, it became clear that, for the foreseeable future, we had
accomplished about as much as we could under the equal protection clause and
that the last step to strict scrutiny would have to await a more sympathetic
Court or an Equal Rights Amendment.  </P>
<P>Meanwhile, in 1975, the Project secured its first major grant from the Ford
Foundation.  This enabled us to develop a significant program to enforce women's
statutory rights, including the rights to equal employment opportunity
guaranteed under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.  At that point, most of the
case law under Title VII involved race discrimination.  The need was to use and
adapt this law for women, to enhance their actual economic well-being along with
their constitutional rights.   </P>
<P>At first, the Project focused on traditionally female occupations in which
women were effectively barred from advancement, such as waitresses refused
employment in elegant first class restaurants and teachers who were not promoted
to principals' jobs.  Then, in the late seventies and early eighties, we decided
to concentrate on cases that would have their greatest impact on poor women and
women of color.  We developed a litigation docket involving non-traditional
jobs, such as truck driving, the skilled trades, and production line factory
jobs.  Such jobs require relatively little education, often provide on-the-job
training, and are much higher paying than traditional &quot;women's jobs.&quot; 
</P>
<P>We also developed a series of cases challenging the use of sex based
actuarial tables to calculate different and lower pensions and insurance
benefits for women workers and cases designed to attack the undervaluation of
work that has traditionally been performed predominantly by women.  These types
of cases are complex, requiring the use of statistics and experts, and highly
experienced litigators. </P>
<P>Of course, throughout the history of the Women's Rights Project, we have
handled or done back up in many &quot;garden variety&quot; pregnancy
discrimination cases.  Pregnancy discrimination is, in many ways, at the heart
of most employment discrimination against women, and we see it in its many
manifestations.  Some women are fired shortly after they announce their
pregnancy, ostensibly on the basis of performance evaluations that are less than
glowing for the first time in their tenure.  Or they no longer get choice
assignments or a promised promotion.  Very often, their job is filled by someone
else while they are on a previously agreed upon leave, or it simply &quot;disappears,&quot;
only to reappear later with another incumbent.  We have also taken cases where
men were denied childcare leaves that were readily available to women.  Until we
eliminate the stereotype that child-rearing is exclusively a women's role,
women's employment will continue to be seen as marginal and temporary.</P>

<P>At the intersection of non-traditional employment and pregnancy
discrimination we found &quot;the new protectionism.&quot;  As women began
entering formerly all-male preserves, many employers suddenly discovered that
the substances and processes that are used in many industries and are known to
create health risks for all workers, might also cause reproductive hazards for
women.  The &quot;solution&quot;?  To &quot;protect&quot; women, often with
families to support, by excluding all fertile women, regardless of childbearing
intent, from these jobs.  This &quot;solution&quot; virtually never surfaced in
occupations, such as health care and beautician, that present similar risks, but
were predominately female and much lower paying.  We pioneered in this field by
bringing Christman v. American Cyanamid (D. W.Va), the case in which five women
submitted to sterilization in order to keep jobs that, shortly thereafter, were
eliminated.  (For an excellent description of this case, see Backlash: The
Undeclared War Against American Women, by Susan Faludi, pp. 437-460.)  Rather
than clean up the workplace, which by the way, exceeded OSHA's new standard for
acceptable lead levels for adults and for men planning to father a child, the
company chose to exclude the women, thus discriminating against both the women
and the men.   We filed under Title VII because the OSHAct does not permit a
private right of action, but we have consistently worked with worker health and
safety groups to insure a safe workplace for all workers.  </P>
<P>Our work in this area culminated in UAW v. Johnson Controls (1991) in which
the Women's Rights Project played a central role.  This case guaranteed women
the right to equal employment opportunity without regard to childbearing
capacity.  It also paved the way for a different and better way to deal with
this problem: by providing a workplace which is protective for both sexes.  This
decision is a necessary if not sufficient step in that direction.  Meanwhile,
some women may have to make the hard choices.  The alternative was no choice.
</P>
<P>While engaged in much significant litigation, the Project has not neglected
its traditional role as an advocate for women's rights in the Supreme Court. 
Our amicus docket reads like a list of the major women's rights and other Title
VII cases decided by the Supreme Court.  For example, the Women's Rights Project
authored major amici briefs in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio (1989);
Price-Waterhouse v. Hopkins (1989) (with NOW LDEF) (exclusion of &quot;macho&quot;
woman from partnership in accounting firm); Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &amp;
Trust (1988) (application of disparate impact theory to subjective selection
practices);  California Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Guerra (1986)
(legality of &quot;maternity&quot; leave); Wimberly v. Labor &amp; Industrial
Relations Commission of Missouri (1986) (unemployment insurance and pregnant
women); Ohio Civil Rights Commission v. Dayton Christian Schools (1986)
(pregnant teacher fired from fundamentalist Christian school on grounds that its
religious tenets did not permit mothers of young children to work outside the
home); Anderson v. Bessemer City (1984) (&quot;working wife&quot; defense, i.e.,
defendants could not have intentionally discriminated against plaintiff because
they had working wives);  U.S. Postal Service v. Aikens (1982) (burden on
plaintiff to show basic qualifications for job or most qualified applicant);
Arizona Governing Committee v, Norris (1983) (use of sex-based rates to charge
women more than men for annuities); County of Washington v. Gunther (1981)
(application of Title VII to wage discrimination complaints where the jobs in
question are not &quot;equal&quot; within the meaning of the Equal Pay Act); and
many others.  This does not include briefs that were primarily written by
volunteer lawyers under Project supervision or briefs primarily prepared by
other ACLU units or other organizations which we joined.  (For example, our
general legal staff has traditionally been responsible for ACLU briefs in
affirmative action cases.  The Project, of course, assisted in the writing of
those briefs.) </P>
<P>The Project has also authored numerous amici briefs in the circuit courts. 
These include United States v. Commonwealth of Virginia (4th Cir., appeal
pending) (the VMI case, co-authored with the National Women's Law Center);
Wright v. Olin (4th Cir. 1982) (fertile women denied &quot;hazardous&quot;
jobs); Hayes v. Shelby Memorial Hosp. (11th Cir. 1984) (pregnant x-ray
technician fired in grounds of reproductive hazard); Zuniga v. Kleberg Hosp.
(5th Cir. 1982) (same); AFSCME v. State of Washington (9th Cir.1985) (use of pay
equity study as evidence of wage discrimination); ANA v. State of Illinois (7th
Cir.1986) (same); and others. </P>
<P>For more information, please see as our 10 Year Report (1973-1983) and
Annual Reports which are available for each year since 1981.  These provide a
more detailed description of our work and an idea of the range and scope of our
programs in litigation (direct and amicus), public education, and other forms of
advocacy.  </P>

</font></center>
<blockquote><font size = +2>S</font> cores of African-American males - including prominent athletes, Members of Congress, actors and business leaders - have experienced the humiliation of being stopped on the nation's roads for no other reason than the alleged traffic offense derisively referred to as &quotDriving While Black.&quot

<p>Congressman John Conyers has proposed legislation that would begin to address this unjust practice. The "Traffic Stops Statistics Act of 1997" would encourage police departments to keep detailed records of traffic stops, including the race and ethnicity of the person stopped. The Justice Department would be charged with collecting the data and determining the full scope of this problem nationwide.
</blockquote>
<center><font face="Arial" size="+2" color="#000080">Support This Legislation</font></center>
<p>
 <img src = "/graphics/redstar.gif">One study of police stops on a strip of interstate in Maryland gives some insight into the nature of the problem. Over several-months in 1995, a survey found that 73 percent of the cars stopped and searched were driven by African-Americans, while they made up only 14 percent of the people driving along the interstate.


<p>
<img src = "/graphics/redstar.gif">While anecdotal evidence abounds, there has been no systematic effort to track this trend from a federal level. ACLU offices in Maryland, Illinois, Indiana and Florida, however, have found enough evidence to warrant federal or state lawsuits against police departments.


<p>
<img src = "/graphics/redstar.gif">This is exactly the sort of unequal treatment that leads minorities to distrust the criminal justice system.



<p><center><font face="Arial" size="+2" color="#000080">TAKE ACTION NOW!</font></center>


<p>This legislation has just been introduced, and so no action has been taken yet. One item that can help the prospects of a bill is the numbers of supporters, or co-sponsors, that have signed on to the bill.  Therefore, we want to encourage Members of Congress to sign onto the bill, so that we have as many cosponsors as possible.

Issue Summary -- Student's Rights

<P>
<blockquote>
<i>"In our system, state-operated schools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism.  School officials do not possess absolute authority over their students.  Students in school as well as out of school are 'persons' under our Constitution."<br></i><b>  Justice Abe Fortas,<i>  Tinker v. DesMoines</i> (1969).</b>
<p>
In spite of the Supreme Courts ringing endorsement of students rights in the landmark Tinker decision, constitutional violations are far too common in public schools across the country.  Articles about controversial subjects written for student newspapers are censored.  Lockers and backpacks are searched without reasonable suspicion.  Minority students are disproportionately shunted in lower track programs.  Majoritarian religious practices are officially sanctioned by teachers and school administrators.  Female students are excluded from certain extracurricular activities, and gay students are intimidated into silence.
<p>
Teachers and administrators have a responsibility to provide a safe environment for the students that is conducive to learning.  They also have a responsibility to respect each students individual rights.  These two missions are not incompatible.  Kids have rights too!

<P>

The widow of Republican Congressman Stewart McKinney, Lucie established a
foundation to assist people with AIDS.  When the McKinney Foundation bought a
house and sought permission to make it a residence for HIV-infected homeless
people, townspeople's objections prompted local officials to turn the
application down.  McKinney won her lawsuit, filed under the Fair Housing Act
and the Americans With Disabilities Act.</font>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These opening words of the First Amendment to the Constitution set forth a 
dual guarantee of religious liberty.  Both the Establishment Clause and  the
Free Exercise Clause operate to protect the religious liberty and  freedom of
conscience of all Americans.  Quoting Thomas Jefferson, the  Supreme Court has
stated that the Establishment Clause was intended to  accomplish this end by
erecting a &quot;wall of separation between Church and  State.&quot;  Everson v.
Board of Educ. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1947).  
</P>
<P>	It is one of the fundamental principles of the Supreme Court's 
Establishment Clause jurisprudence that the Constitution forbids not only  state
practices that &quot;aid one religion . . . or prefer one religion over 
another,&quot; but also those practices that &quot;aid all religions&quot; and
thus  endorse or prefer religion over nonreligion.  Everson, 330 U.S. at 15.  

See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 53 (1985)(&quot;[T]he individual freedom 
of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to  select any
religious faith or none at all&quot;); see also County of Allegheny  v. ACLU
Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 589-94, 598-602 (1989);  Texas
Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1, 17 (1989); Torcaso v. Watkins,  367 U.S.
488, 495 (1961).  
</P>
<P>	For the past 20 years, the federal courts have utilized the  three-pronged
framework first set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602  (1971), to

maintain the separation of government and religion.  Under the  so-called &quot;Lemon
test,&quot; a court must inquire (1) whether the government's  action has a

secular or a religious purpose; (2) whether the primary  effect of the
government's action is to advance or endorse religion; and  (3) whether the
government's policy or practice fosters an excessive  entanglement between
government and religion.  See 403 U.S. at 612-13.   In recent years, the Supreme
Court has also frequently asked whether the  challenged governmental action
constitutes an impermissible &quot;endorsement&quot;  of religion.  See, e.g.,
Allegheny, 492 U.S. at 592 (inquiry is whether  the government &quot;convey[s]
or attempt[s] to convey a message that religion  or a particular religious
belief is favored or preferred&quot;); id. at 592-94;  School District of the
City of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 390  (1985)(&quot;[A]n important
concern of the effects test is whether the  symbolic union of church and state
effected by the challenged governmental  action is sufficiently likely to be
perceived by adherents ... as an  endorsement, and by nonadherents as a
disapproval, of their   individual religious choices&quot;). 
</P>
<H4>  <A NAME="graduation"></A>                    I.  GRADUATION PRAYER</H4>
<P>	The Supreme Court has long held that the Establishment Clause of  the First
Amendment forbids school-sponsored prayer or religious  indoctrination.  Over
thirty years ago, the Court struck down classroom  prayers and scripture
readings even where they were voluntary and students  had the option of being
excused.  See School Dist. of Abington Township v.  Schempp, 374 U.S. 203
(1963); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421 (1962).  The  Court earlier had struck
down a &quot;released-time&quot; program providing  voluntary religious
instruction in public schools during regular school  hours.  See Illinois ex
rel. McCollum v. Board of Educ., 333 U.S. 203,  209-10 (1948).  
</P>
<P>	More recently, the Supreme Court has held that a school district  may not
require that students observe a moment of silence at the beginning  of the
school day where the purpose of such a requirement is that students  use that
time for prayer.  Wallace, 472 U.S. at 40.  In a similar vein,  the Court has
held that the state may not require the posting of the Ten  Commandments in
public school classrooms, Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39, 41  (1980)(per curiam),
and may not require the teaching of &quot;creation science&quot;   in public
school science classes where evolution is taught, Edwards v.  Aguillard, 482
U.S. 578, 596-97 (1987).  
</P>
<P>	The fundamental principle underlying all these decisions is that  the
Constitution commands that public schools may not take sides in  matters of
religion and may not endorse a particular religious perspective  or any religion
at all.  
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>       A.  The Supreme Court's Graduation Prayer Decision</H4></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>	In 1992, the Supreme Court held in Lee v. Weisman, ___ U.S.  ___,  112
S.Ct. 2649 (1992), that prayer -- even nonsectarian and  nonproselytizing prayer
-- at public school graduation ceremonies violated  the Establishment Clause of
the Constitution.  The Supreme Court held  that the inclusion of prayers as part
of a school-sponsored and  school-supervised graduation ceremony contravened the
Establishment Clause  both because of its inevitably coercive effect on students
and because it  conveyed a message of government endorsement of religion.  See
id. at  2655.  
</P>
<P>	The Supreme Court focused on the subtle coercive pressures that  accompany
any religious exercise conducted as part of a school-sponsored  event.  The
Court held that even though the school district in Lee did not  require students
to attend graduation in order to receive their diplomas,  the students'
attendance and participation in graduation exercises was &quot;in  a fair and
real sense obligatory.&quot;  Id. at 2655.  As the Court observed:  
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Everyone knows that in our society and in our culture high school 
graduation is one of life's most significant occasions....  Attendance may  not
be required by official decree, yet it is apparent that a student is  not free
to absent herself from the graduation exercise in any real sense  of the term &quot;voluntary,&quot;
for absence would require forfeiture of those  intangible benefits which have
motivated the student through youth and all  her high school years.  
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 2659.  Because attendance at high school graduation ceremonies is  in
effect not voluntary -- and because the ceremonies themselves are an  adjunct to
and, in some sense, the culmination of the public school  curriculum -- the
inclusion of a religious program in graduation  ceremonies violates the
Establishment Clause.  As the Court stated in Lee:  
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The prayer exercises in this case are especially improper because the  State
has in every practical sense compelled attendance and participation  in an
explicit religious exercise at an event of singular importance to  every
student, one the objecting student had no real alternative to  avoid.  
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 2661. 
</P>
<P>	The Supreme Court in Lee also focused on the unavoidable  entanglement of
government and religion that results from any attempt by  school officials to
control the content of graduation prayers, even if  that control extends, as it
did in Lee, only to making sure that the  prayers given are nondenominational. 
Under Lee, school officials may not  in any way &quot;assist in composing
prayers as an incident to a formal  exercise for their students.&quot;  Id. at
2657.  As the Court explained:  
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The question is not the good faith of the school in attempting to make the 
prayer acceptable to most persons, but the legitimacy of its undertaking  that
enterprise at all when the object was to produce a prayer to be used  in a
formal religious exercise which students, for all practical  purposes, are
obliged to attend.  
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 2656.  The Court observed that the religion clauses of the First 
Amendment &quot;mean that religious beliefs and religious expression are too 
precious to be either proscribed or prescribed by the State.&quot;  Id.  
</P>
<P>	Contrary to protests voiced by the religious right, the Supreme  Court's
holding in Lee is not anti-religious and does not interfere with  the rights of
students, guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause of the  First Amendment, to
worship and pray according to the dictates of their  own consciences.  As the
Supreme Court stated over three decades ago in  Engel:  
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is neither sacrilegious nor antireligious to say that each separate 
government in this country should stay out of the business of writing or 
sanctioning official prayers and leave that purely religious function to  the
people themselves and to those the people choose to look to for  religious
guidance.  
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>370 U.S. at 435.   
</P>
<P>	It is likewise clear that graduation prayer cannot be justified as  a
permissible &quot;accommodation&quot; of religion under the Free Exercise Clause
 of the First Amendment.  Government efforts to accommodate the religious 
beliefs and practices of individuals are permitted under the Establishment 
Clause only when they remove government-imposed burdens on the free  exercise of
religion.  See Lee, 112 S.Ct. at 2676-77 (Souter, J.,  concurring); Allegheny,
492 U.S. at 601 n.51; id. at 631 (O'Connor, J.,  concurring).  
</P>
<P>	The absence of prayer from a school's official graduation ceremony  does
not impose any burden on the ability of students to affirm their  religious
beliefs before or after the ceremony.  Nothing in Lee, for  example, would
prevent or prohibit like-minded students from organizing a  privately sponsored
baccalaureate service -- provided that it was held off  school grounds, was
entirely voluntary, and was neither sponsored nor  supervised by school
officials.  See 112 S.Ct. at 2677 (Souter, J.,  concurring).  
</P>
<H4>             B.  Student-Initiated Graduation Prayer</H4>
<P></P>
<P>1.  The Fifth Circuit's decision in Jones v.  		Clear Creek Indep. Sch.
Dist. 
</P>
<P>	This past year, a federal appeals court in Texas approved a school  board's
policy allowing graduation prayer where a majority of the  graduating class had
requested that a prayer be given by a student  volunteer at the school's
graduation ceremony.  Jones v. Clear Creek  Indep. Sch. Dist., 977 F.2d 963 (5th
Cir. 1992), cert. denied, ___ U.S.  ___ 113 S.Ct. 2950 (1993).  
</P>
<P>	As a technical matter, the decision in Jones only applies within  the three
states comprising the Fifth Circuit (Texas, Louisiana and  Mississippi).  More
fundamentally, in our view, Jones seriously misreads  the Supreme Court's
holding in Lee.  
</P>
<P>	The Supreme Court made clear that its decision in Lee did not turn  on the
fact that school officials made the decision to include prayers in  the
graduation ceremony or the fact that the principal selected the  particular
clergyman who gave the prayers.  Rather, the Court held that  prayers at public
school graduation ceremonies carry the imprimatur of the  state and, therefore,
impermissibly endorse religion because the prayers  are included as part of a
program that is sponsored, supervised and  controlled b y the school and at
which student attendance is, for all  practical purposes, obligatory.  See 112
S.Ct. at 2657.  Lee thus stands  for the straightforward proposition that when
public schools reserve time  at a graduation ceremony for prayers, they violate
the Constitution by  putting the power, prestige and endorsement of the state
behind whatever  prayer is offered, no matter who offers it.  
</P>
<P>	As the Supreme Court observed, &quot;the school district's supervision  and
control of a high school graduation ceremony places public pressure,  as well as
peer pressure, on attending students&quot; to act in a manner that  signifies
participation in or approval of religious exercises that an  individual student
may find repugnant to his or her own beliefs.  112  S.Ct. at 2658.  
</P>
<P>	The Fifth Circuit in Jones relied in part on the fact that school 
officials reviewed the student prayers to ensure that they were 
nondenominational and nonproselytizing.  977 F.2d at 971.(1) Yet this  review by
itself impermissibly involves school officials in deciding which  prayers are
acceptable and which are not.  As the Supreme Court warned in  its first school
prayer decision, &quot;one of the greatest dangers to the  freedom of the
individual to worship in his own way [lies] in the  government's placing its
official stamp of approval upon one particular  kind of prayer or one particular
form of religious services.&quot;  Engel, 370  U.S. at 429.  In Lee, the Supreme
Court reaffirmed this basic tenet when  it stated that &quot;our precedents do
not permit school officials to assist in  composing prayers as an incident to a
formal exercise for their students.&quot;   112 S.Ct. at 2657.  
</P>
<P>	This past summer, the Supreme Court decided not to review the  Fifth
Circuit's decision in Jones.  Over the past few months, leaders of  the
religious right have claimed that the Supreme Court's action is an  endorsement
of student-initiated prayer and a vindication of Jones.  That  characterization
is simply wrong as a matter of law.  The Supreme Court's  decision does not
indicate approval of the result in Jones, nor does it  transform the Fifth
Circuit's decision into a national precedent.  
</P>
<P>	The Supreme Court grants review on writ of certiorari in only a  small
fraction of the cases that are presented to it each year.  Its  decision not to
grant review in a particular case is wholly discretionary  and is rarely
explained, as it was not in the J ones case.  See generally  P. Bator, D.
Meltzer, P. Mishkin &amp; D. Shapiro, Hart &amp; Wechsler's The  Federal Courts
and the Federal System, at 1855 (3d ed. 1988).  
</P>
<P>	The Court has emphasized that a denial of certiorari is not a  decision on
the merits and thus carries no precedential weight.  See  Teague v. Lane, 489
U.S. 288, 296 (1989)(&quot;[A] denial of a writ of  certiorari imports no
expression upon the merits of the case&quot;)(quoting  United States v. Carver,
260 U.S. 482, 490 (1923)(Holmes, J.)); Maryland  v. Baltimore Radio Show, 338
U.S. 912, 917-19 (1950)(opinion of  Frankfurter, J.).  See generally 16 C.
Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper &amp; E.  Gressman, Federal Practice &amp;
Procedure 4004, at 510-511 &amp; n.20 (1977 &amp;  Supp. 1993).  As Justice
William J. Brennan has explained:  
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A denial of certiorari is not an affirmance of the [lower] court judgment 
as some erroneously think . . . . The denial does not mean that the Court 
agrees with the result reached by the [lower] court. . . . The Court may  very
well take the next case raising the same question and reach a  different result
on the merits.  
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Lee v. Weisman, not Jones, is the law of the land, and Lee holds that 
graduation prayer is unconstitutional.  
</P>
<P>2.  Other decisions on student-initiated prayer 
</P>

<P>	Following the Supreme Court's denial of certiorari in Jones, a  handful of
federal courts have considered challenges to student-initiated  graduation
prayers.  Although the outcomes of these cases have been  somewhat mixed, the
more well-reasoned decisions, including a decision by  the Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit, have held that  student-initiated graduation prayers run
afoul of the separation of church  and state required by the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment.  
</P>
<P>	Federal courts in Iowa, New Jersey, and Virginia have held that 
student-initiated prayers of the type at issue in Jones are forbidden by  the
Establishment Clause.  See ACLU v. Blackhorse Pike Regional Bd. of  Educ., Dkt.
No. 93-5368 (3d Cir. June 25, 1993 ); Friedmann v. Sheldon  Community Sch.
Dist., Dkt. No. C93-4052 (N.D. Iowa, May 28, 1993), vacated  on standing
grounds, Dkt. No. 93-2375 (8th Cir. May 28, 1993); Gearon v.  Loudon County Sch.
Bd., Dkt. No. 93-730-A (E.D. Va. June 21, 1993), stayed  pending appeal, Dkt.
No. 93-1770 (4th Cir. June 23, 1993). (2) 
</P>
<P>	In Blackhorse Pike, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit  enjoined a
proposed student-initiated graduation prayer, noting that:  
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>the graduation ceremony is a school sponsored event; the fact that the 
school board has chosen to delegate the decision regarding one segment of  that
ceremony to members of the graduating class does not alter that  sponsorship,
does not diminish the effect of a prayer on students who do  not share the same
or any religious perspective, and does not serve to  distinguish, in any
material way, the facts of this case from the facts of  Lee v. Weisman.  
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Slip op. at 1.   
</P>
<P>	In Friedmann, the United States District Court for the Northern  District
of Iowa held that graduation prayers offered by authority of a  majority student
vote &quot;run head on into the mandate of Lee v. Weisman&quot; and  are
constitutionally impermissible.  Slip op. at 2.  Likewise, in Gearon,  the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia  found that a
school district's protocol allowing students to vote for the  offering of a
nonsectarian, nonproselytizing graduation prayer violated  the Establishment
Clause.  Slip op. at 4.  
</P>
<P>	The Fifth Circuit's decision in Jones also runs contrary to the  decisions
of other federal courts of appeal and that have addressed the  issue of
student-initiated prayers at school-sponsored events.  In Jager  v. Douglas
County Sch. Dist., 862 F.2d 824 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 490  U.S. 1090
(1989), the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that  prayers at
public high school football games violated the Establishment  Clause, even
though student clubs designated the individuals who gave the  prayers. 
Likewise, in Collins v. Chandler Unified Sch. Dist., 644 F.2d  759, 762 (9th
Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 863 (1981), the Ninth Circuit  Court of Appeals
held that student-initiated prayer and Bible readings at  school assemblies
violated the Establishment Clause, even though the  prayers and readings were
given by student volunteers.(3) Finally, the  Fifth Circuit itself, in Karen B.

v. Treen, 653 F.2d 897 (5th Cir. 1981),  aff'd, 455 U.S. 913 (1982), held that
the Establishment Clause prohibited  student volunteers from leading fellow
classmates in prayer, even though  students could be excused from participating.
 653 F.2d at 901-02.(4) 
</P>
<P>	As these cases demonstrate, Jones relies on a crabbed reading of  Lee that
rests almost entirely on a distinction between school-initiated  and
student-initiated graduation prayer that is irrelevant to the analysis  and
result in Lee and that ignores the inherently coercive nature of a  religious
exercise conducted as part of an event convened and sponsored by  the school.  
</P>
<P>	The fact that a majority of students may ask the school district  to allow
a prayer at graduation does not change the requirements of the  Establishment
Clause.  Indeed, the very purpose of the Establishment  Clause is to prevent a
majoritarian government from imposing particular  religious beliefs -- or any
religious beliefs at all -- on individuals in  our society who do not share
those beliefs.  See West Virginia Bd. of  Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624
(1943).  As Justice Jackson wrote for the  Court in Barnette:  
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from 
the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach  of
majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied
by the courts.  One's right to life, liberty, and property, to  free speech, a
free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other  fundamental rights may
not be submitted to vote; they depend on the  outcome of no elections.  
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 638 (emphasis added). 
</P>
<P>	The entire premise of the Bill of Rights is that individual  liberty must
be safeguarded and must sometimes trump the desires of the  majority.  High
school students, by majority vote, may no more use the  machinery of the state
to impose religion on a minority of dissenters  than may a majority of students
ask the school board to violate the First  Amendment by engaging in censorship
or violate the Fourth Amendment by  engaging in unreasonable searches of
students.  As the Supreme Court  declared in Lee, 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>[W]hile in some societies the wishes of the majority might prevail, the 
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment is addressed to this  contingency
and rejects [it].  The Constitution forbids the State to exact  religious
conformity from a student as the price of attending her own  graduation.  
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>112 S.Ct. at 2660. 
</P>
<P></P>
<H4>Notes</H4>
<P>1. Even the Jones court limited its decision, however, to non-sectarian  
prayers.  The Fifth Circuit correctly indicated that a student-initiated  
prayer that was sectarian or proselytizing would run afoul of the  
Establishment Clause.  See 977 F.2nd at 969. 
</P>
<P>2.  Contra Harris v. Joint School District No. 241, 821 F.Supp. 638 (D.  
Idaho 1993), appeal docketed, No. 93-35893 (9th Cir. June 15, 1993.) 
</P>
<P>3.  Notably, the Ninth Circuit in Collins found &quot;no meaningful  
distinction between school authorities actually organizing the religious  
activity and officials merely 'permitting' students to direct the   exercises.&quot;
644 F.2nd at 761. 
</P>
<P>4.  Indeed, the Fifth Circuit itself no appears to have backed away from  
the Jones court's exceedingly narrow reading of Lee.  In a subsequent   case,
Doe v. Duncanville Indep. Sch. Dist., 994 F.2nd 160 (5th Cir.   1993), the court
struck down the practice of offering prayers before high   school basketball
games.  In Doe, the Fifth Circuit recognized that Lee   &quot;is merely the most
recent in a long line of cases carving out of the   Establishment Clause what
essentially amounts to a per se rule prohibiting   public-school-related or
-initiated religious expression or   indoctrination.&quot;  Id. at 165. 
</P>
<H4> <A NAME="bible"></A>                    II.  BIBLE DISTRIBUTION</H4>
<P>	Earlier this year, the United States Court of Appeals for the  Seventh
Circuit ruled that an Indiana school district's policy and  practice permitting
representatives of Gideon International to distribute  Bibles in public schools
during school hours violated the Establishment  Clause of the Constitution.  See
Berger v. Rensselaer Central School  Corp., 982 F.2d 1160 (7th Cir.), cert.
denied, ___ U.S. ___, 113 S.Ct.  2344 (1993).  
</P>
<P>	In Berger, the father of two elementary school children challenged  the
local school district's longstanding practice of allowing the Gideons  to come
into the public schools during instructional hours and distribute  Bibles to
fifth-grade students.  Even t hough the teachers did not  participate in handing
out the Bibles to the students, and even though the  Bibles were not used for
pedagogical purposes, the Seventh Circuit held  that the in-school Bible
distribution was &quot;a far more glaring offense to  First Am endment
principles&quot; than the nonsectarian graduation prayer at  issue in Lee.  See
Berger, 982 F.2d at 1169.  
</P>
<P>	A long line of Supreme Court precedents establish that it is  impermissible
for school officials to allow the machinery of the state to  be used to gather
an audience for religious exercises or instruction.  See  Illinois ex rel.
McCollum v. Board of Educ., 333 U.S. 203; Engel, 370 U.S.  421.  In McCollum,
for example, the Supreme Court struck down a program  allowing religious
instructors to come into the public schools to teach  sectarian classes during
school hours, at a time when students would be  free to attend the religious
classes or remain in their regular classes.   The Court stated that:  
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Here not only are the State's tax-supported public school buildings used 
for the dissemination of religious doctrines.  The State also affords  sectarian
groups an invaluable aid in that it helps to provide pupils for  their religious
classes through use of the State's compulsory public  school machinery.  
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>333 U.S. at 212. 
</P>
<P>	It violates one of the Establishment Clause's most fundamental  principles
to turn government power over to religion.  As the Supreme  Court has
recognized, the public school is the forum through which basic  norms of
citizenship are transmitted to the next generation and is thus a  &quot;vital
civic institution for the preservation of a democratic system of  government.&quot;
 See Abington Township, 374 U.S. at 230 (Brennan, J.,  concurring).  When
government permits a religious group to take over part  of the school's
facilities during instructional time, however briefly, it  strongly implies
official endorsement of that religion.  In the Grand  Rapids case, the Supreme
Court stressed the importance of avoiding any  &quot;symbolic link&quot; between
government and religion.  The Court held that the  second (&quot;effects&quot;)

prong of the Lemon test will not be satisfied where the  government fosters a &quot;close
identification of its powers and  responsibilities with those of any -- or all
-- religious denominations.&quot;   School District of the City of Grand Rapids
v. Ball, 473 U.S. at 385.  
</P>
<P>	A school's participation in or supervision of the Gideons' Bible 
distribution impermissibly suggests that the Gideons' program is a valid  part
of a legally required education.  The practice also carries the  unmistakable
message that religion -- in this case, Christian Bible study  -- is the norm and
the non-adherents are something less than full members  of the school community.
 &quot;When the government puts its imprimatur on a  particular religion, it
conveys a message of exclusion to all those who do  not adhere to the favored
beliefs.&quot;  Lee, 112 S.Ct. at 2665 (Blackmun,  J., concurring).  See
Wallace, 472 U.S. at 69 (O'Connor, J.,  concurring)(government endorsement of
religion violates the Establishment  Clause because it &quot;sends a message to
nonadherents that they are  outsiders, not full members of the political
community, and an  accompanying message to adherents that the are insiders,
favored members  of the political community&quot;); see also Lynch v. Donnelly,
465 U.S. 668,  688 (1984)(O'Connor, J., concurring).  
</P>
<P>As the Seventh Circuit aptly observed in Berger: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>the act of accepting a Bible in front of other students, with the option  of
returning it later privately or choosing not to read it, signals accord  with
the Gideons' beliefs.  Presumably, the fifth graders could make a  public show
of not accepting the Bible, just as students could walk out  of the graduation
ceremony in Lee, or leave during the scriptural reading  in Abington, but the
First Amendment prohibits the government from putting  children in this
difficult position.  
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>982 F.2d at 1170. 
</P>
<P>	Moreover, the Supreme Court repeatedly has emphasized the 
impressionability of primary and secondary school children and the  pressure
they are apt to feel from teachers, administrators and peers to  conform.  As
the Supreme Court recently observed in Lee, &quot;there are  heightened concerns
with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle  coercive pressure in the
elementary and secondary public schools&quot;  112  S.Ct. at 2658.  See Edwards,
482 U.S. at 584; see also Grand Rapids, 473  U.S. at 390 (&quot;The symbolism of
a union between church and state is most  likely to influence children of tender
years, whose experience is limited  and whose beliefs consequently are the
function of environment as much as  of free and voluntary choice&quot;).  
</P>
<P>	The Seventh Circuit also properly rejected the school district's  argument
that barring the Gideons from distributing Bibles in the public  schools would
violate the Gideons' First Amendment free speech rights.  It  is well
established that the free speech rights of individuals and  religious groups to
engage in religious expression must be subordinated to  Establishment Clause
concerns where those individuals or groups seek to  observe their religion in a
manner that unduly involves the government.   See, e.g. , Engel v. Vitale, 370
U.S. 421 (students and teachers may not  recite prayers in school); McCollum,
333 U.S. 203 (teachers may not  provide religious instruction on public school
property); see also Berger,  982 F.2d at 1168.  Religious groups such as the
Gideons remain free to  promote Bible study and otherwise proselytize in ways
that do not carry  the imprimatur of state endorsement.  
</P>
<H4> <A NAME="equal"></A>            III.  EQUAL ACCESS TO SCHOOL FACILITIES</H4>
<P>	The Establishment Clause issues are quite different where a school 
district wishes to make its facilities available for use by student or 
community groups during non-school hours.  In such cases, the  Establishment
Clause does not prohibit opening the school's facilities to  religious groups --
provided no elements of school sponsorship or  endorsement are present.  
</P>
<P>	Indeed, once the school district opens its facilities for use by  students
or members of the community during non-school hours, the Free  Speech Clause of
the First Amendment requires that the school district not  discriminate based on
the point of view of groups seeking access to those  facilities.  See Cornelius
v. NAACP Legal Defense and Educ. Fund, Inc.,  473 U.S. 788, 800 (1985); Perry
Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators'  Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 46 (1983).  
</P>
<P>	This year, in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches School District,  ___ U.S.
___, 113 S.Ct. 2141 (1993), the Supreme Court held that a school  district
violated the First Amendment free speech rights of a local church  by refusing
to permit the church to exhibit, on school property during  non-school hours, a
film series dealing with family values and  child-rearing from a religious
perspective, even though those same school  facilities were open to other groups
in the community desiring to address  the same subjects from other perspectives.
 See id. at 2147-48.  
</P>
<P>	The Supreme Court further held that allowing Lamb's Chapel to  exhibit its
film series would not contravene the Establishment Clause  because the showing
of the films &quot;would not have been during school hours,  would not have been
sponsored by the school, and would have been open to  the public&quot; and
because school property &quot;had repeatedly been used by a  wide variety of
private organizations.&quot;  Id. at 2148.  The presence of  these four factors,
the Court held, ensured that there was &quot;no realistic  danger that th e
community would think that the District was endorsing  religion or any
particular creed&quot; and that the school's action satisfied  the three-part
test of Lemon.  113 S.Ct. at 2148.  
</P>
<P>	In Lamb's Chapel, the school district had made school facilities  available

for use by private community groups during non-school hours  pursuant to a New
York law authorizing local school boards to open school  property to the
community for &quot;social, civil, and recreational meetings  and
entertainments, and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the  community&quot;
so long as such uses were &quot;non-exclusive and open to the  general public.&quot;
 Id. at 2143-44 (quoting N.Y.E.L. sec. 414(1)(c)).  The  school district,
however, denied the request of Lamb's Chapel and its  pastor to show a religious
film series because of the school district's  rule that school premises &quot;shall
not be used by any group for religious  purposes.&quot;  Id. at 2144.  The
Supreme Court found that the school district  engaged in impermissible viewpoint
discrimination in allowing community  groups to use school facilities to address
family and child-rearing issues  from non-religious perspectives but in denying
Lamb's Chapel access to  school property to address the same issues from a
religious point of view.   See id. at 2147-48.  
</P>
<P>	The question of when a religious group's use of government  property
presents a valid claim of equal access and when, instead,  granting it access
crosses the line into government endorsement of  religion can be a difficult one
to answer.  Though the answer inevitably  turns on issues of context and on the
facts of the particular case, the  Supreme Court's decision in Lamb's Chapel
provides some helpful guideposts  to assist school districts in this area.  
</P>
<P>	In Lamb's Chapel, the proposed use of the public school auditorium  was
limited, occasional, and comparable to other uses already permitted by  the
school district.  The proposed use was to occur in the evenings, well  after
school hours.  The activity was not uniquely religious, like worship  or prayer;
it was open to the public; it concerned a subject of general  interest addressed
to the entire community; and it was not to be promoted  by the school.  See id.
at 2144-46.  
</P>
<P>	The result clearly would be different, however, if a religious  group were
to seek special access to public school students during the  school day.  See
McCollum, 333 U.S. 203; Berger, 982 F.2d 1160.  Any  request by a religious

group for special privileges -- including access  that is significantly
different in either quality or quantity from the  access granted to other
student or community groups not available to  secular groups -- would raise
serious Establishment Clause problems.  See  Texas Monthly, 489 U .S. at 17.  
</P>
<H4><A NAME="holiday"></A>                 IV.  RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY PARTIES</H4>
<P>	In the past year, some religious activists have encouraged public  school
districts to ignore the Supreme Court's Establishment Clause  rulings and to
celebrate the religious significance of holidays such as  Christmas as part of
the regular school curriculum.  It is clear,  however, from the Supreme Court's
cases dealing with public school  education, as well as the Court's decisions
involving the public display  of religious symbols, that the Establishment
Clause prohibits public  schools from sponsoring holiday observances --
including Christmas  programs or Christmas pageants -- that promote or emphasize
the religious  significance of the holiday.  

</P>
<P>	In two recent decisions, the Supreme Court has held that displays  of
religious symbols such as nativity scenes on public property contravene  the
Establishment Clause if they convey a message that is primarily  religious
rather than secular.  See Allegheny , 492 U.S. 573; Lynch, 465  U.S. 668 (1984).
 Under the test of Lemon as refined in Allegheny, the  government's display of
religious symbols violates the Constitution where  the government's action &quot;has
either the purpose of effect of endorsing  religion.&quot;  Allegheny, 492 U.S.
at 592-93.  As Justice O'Connor has  formulated the endorsement test, the
inquiry is whether an &quot;objective  observer,&quot; familiar with the
government's practice and acquainted with  Free Exercise values, would view the
governmental action a s an  endorsement of religion.  See Wallace, 472 U.S. at
76 (O'Connor, J.,  concurring).  
</P>
<P>	In Lynch, for example, the Court upheld a city's display of a  nativity
scene together with various secular symbols of Christmas,  including a Christmas
tree and Santa Claus house.  See Lynch, 465 U.S. at  679-85.  In Allegheny,
however, the Court ruled that a city's display in  the County Courthouse of a

creche with a banner proclaiming &quot;Glory to God  in the Highest&quot;
constituted an impermissible endorsement of religion under  the Establishment
Clause.  See Allegheny, 492 U.S. at 598-602.  The Court  in Allegheny emphasized
the importance of both the setting of the  religious symbols and their &quot;patently
Christian message.&quot;  Id. at 601.  
</P>
<P>	As discussed in preceding sections, the Supreme Court has been  especially
vigilant in the public school context to ensure that schools do  not engage in
practices that convey a religious message or imply an  endorsement of religion. 
One of the reasons for the Court's heightened  concern in the school cases is
its recognition that elementary and  secondary school students are more
impressionable than adults and more  susceptible to official pressure and peer
pressure to conform to what they  may perceive as a school-sponsored religious
orthodoxy.  See, e.g., Lee,  112 S.Ct. at 2658.  
</P>
<P>	Holiday observances in public schools which focus on the religious 
significance of Christmas to Christians, rather than on those aspects of  the
holiday that have become part of our country's secular culture, carry  precisely
the dangers of religious endorsement and subtle coercive  pressure that have led
the Supreme Court to mandate a strict separation of  church and state within the
public schools.  
</P>
<P>	Thus far, few courts have addressed the issue of public school  observances
of religious holidays.  In Florey v. Sioux Falls School  District 49-5, 619 F.2d
1311 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 987  (1980), the Eighth Circuit ruled
that public schools may hold holiday  observances, such as Christmas concerts or
programs, so long as the  programs deal with the &quot;secular or cultural basis
or heritage of the  holidays.&quot;  Id. at 1317.  The court approved a school
district policy that  allowed public schools to observe only holidays that had a
secular as  well as a religious basis and provided that religious symbols &quot;may
be used  only as a teaching aid or resource and only if they are displayed as a 
part of the cultural and religious heritage of the holiday and are  temporary in
nature.&quot;  Id.  The court contrasted these permissible  observances with
what it regarded as a clearly unconstitutional practice:   a responsive
discourse between teacher and students about the importance  of the birth of
Jesus.  See id. at 1317 -18.  
</P>
<P>	Florey holds that public school observances of religious holidays  may
address the religious aspects of the holiday only as part of a  &quot;secular
program of education.&quot;  Id. at 1317.  This requirement is  consistent with
Supreme Court decisions stating that academic study of  religion, or religious
texts, is not forbidden in the public schools so  long as religious topics are &quot;presented
objectively as part of a secular  program of education.&quot;  Abington
Township, 374 U.S. at 225; accord Stone,  449 U.S. at 41 (noting that the Bible
may constitutionally be used as  part of the secular study of history or
comparative religion).  
</P>
<P>	While it is clear that the Constitution does not forbid the mere  mention
of religion in the public schools, it is also clear from the  Supreme Court's
Establishment Clause decisions that the public schools may  not observe
religious holidays in a manner that has the effect of  promoting or endorsing
the religious themes associated with those  holidays.

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Gay/Straight Clubs <BR>Formed by <BR>Public School
Students:<BR><BR>Why School Officials<BR>Need to<BR>Treat Them Equally</H1>
<HR>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>Lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union Lesbian
and Gay Rights Project, Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the
National Center for Lesbian Rights developed this document along with other
concerned citizens fighting bans on gay/straight alliances in Utah and in
Glendale, California.  We encourage you to use this document if faced with
similar proposals in your community. For further help, contact any one of the
above organizations.</I></FONT></P>
<H3>I.  SCHOOLS SHOULD BE SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF RESPECT FOR THE CONSTITUTION
AND OUR NATION'S LAWS.</H3>
<P>One reason we have public schools is to teach young people how to become
good citizens.  Part of that teaching centers on respect for and appreciation of
the United States Constitution. The legal requirement that school officials not
discriminate against any non-curriculum related student club because of the
message or subject matter of that club reinforces for students one of our most
cherished and important constitutional principles -- government may not
interfere with freedom of speech or association simply because the content of a
group's or individual's expression is controversial or unpopular.</P>
<P>The First Amendment and the federal Equal Access Act (20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;4071-4074)
establish this requirement of equal treatment for all non-curriculum related
clubs.  A secondary school that provides a meeting place during
non-instructional time for any voluntary, student-initiated club is required by
law to provide the same meeting facilities for <I>all</I> non-curriculum
related groups. </P>
<P>The school is thus facilitating an &quot;open forum&quot; for student group
activities.  As the Equal Access Act itself emphasizes, schools do not endorse
the views or activities of any of the groups they allow to meet on campus;
instead, they create a forum for the students to discuss the issues the students
choose.
</P>
<P>Banning certain clubs because students' views are unconventional or
unpopular guts the very point of the First Amendment and the Equal Access Act. 
The Constitution and this federal statute would not be needed if only majority,
well-established views were allowed to be heard.</P>
<P>By honoring the core principles of the Constitution and the Equal Access
Act, schools set an example of respect for the law and for freedom of
expression.</P>
<H3>II.  SCHOOLS SHOULD PROMOTE STUDENT CLUBS AS PART OF DEVELOPING FUTURE GOOD
CITIZENS AND HEALTHY MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY.</H3>
<P>Student clubs are a valuable part of teenagers' junior high and high school
experiences.  By creating a forum for voluntary, student-initiated clubs that
meet on school grounds when classes are not in session, school officials give
teenagers the opportunity to learn how to create and run an organization, how to
plan political, social, cultural, religious, or recreational activities, and how
to get along and interact productively with one another.</P>
<P>Abolishing all non-curriculum related student clubs just because a club with
a controversial political or religious perspective has been established would be
a tragedy for and disservice to all students.</P>
<H3>III.  GAY/STRAIGHT STUDENT CLUBS BENEFIT THE STUDENTS WHO FORM THEM AND THE
STUDENTS WHO LATER BECOME MEMBERS.</H3>
<P>Gay/straight alliances and similar student groups that teenagers form to

address sexual orientation issues should be treated just like any other
student-initiated groups.  As with other groups, meetings at school during
non-instructional times provide a safe, central place for students with similar
concerns and interests to gather.</P>
<P>By junior high and high school, students are becoming aware of their own
sexuality. They are also aware of sexual orientation issues, both in the

political sphere and more personally.  Sexual orientation is daily made an
issue:  by school activities, such as dances and other social events; by
cultural influences, such as television; and by more informal interactions that
presume heterosexuality and a growing interest of teenagers in those of a
different sex.  Thus, gay/straight alliances do not introduce sexual orientation
concerns to students -- instead, they provide helpful forums for students to
discuss already-developing personal and political concerns with one another. 
</P>
<P>Schools should not ban these helpful forums for discussion.  Doing so takes
a difficult adolescent experience and introduces more fear and confusion.</P>
<H3>IV.  GAY/STRAIGHT STUDENT CLUBS ALSO BENEFIT THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY AS A
WHOLE.</H3>
<P>Anti-gay harassment and violence are particularly prevalent in schools and
among teenagers. Hearings on the issue have occurred in Kansas, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, and Texas.  Perhaps the most common way today for young people to
disparage one another is to call a peer a &quot;faggot&quot; or a &quot;dyke.&quot;
 A disproportionate amount of the widespread physical violence against gay men
and lesbians, of all ages, is committed by teenage boys.</P>
<P>Gay/straight alliances help combat an atmosphere of verbal and physical
harassment by explicitly condemning the bigotry as an organized group of
students, or by simply providing an opportunity for the discussion of different
student perspectives on such anti-gay incidents.  Students talking to fellow
students is a particularly effective way of making young people aware of the
harms caused by discrimination and violence.</P>
<H3>V.  SCHOOLS SHOULD ADDRESS ANTI-GAY ABUSE BY DISCIPLINING THE ABUSERS, NOT
BY BANNING MEETINGS BY THOSE WHO ARE ABUSED.</H3>
<P>When acts of anti-gay harassment, particularly physical violence, occur in
the schools, administrators should respond promptly to take action against the
perpetrators and to support the students who have been harassed.  Providing a
safe, welcoming school environment for all students is one of the core
responsibilities of public school officials.</P>
<P>Incidents of, or the potential for, anti-gay violence do not provide a
reason for forbidding gay/straight alliances or similar groups.  Such a &quot;blame
the victim&quot; argument is often made by those who do not want to face up to
the ugly bigotry of gay harassment and do not want to take appropriate action
against victimizers.</P>
<P>Voluntary gay/straight alliances among students are part of the solution,
not part of the problem of anti-gay violence.  If schools treat the alliances as
the problem, they are teaching all students that might makes right, and that the
school's lessons about respecting others are not meant to be taken seriously.</P>
<H3>VI.  GAY AND LESBIAN TEENS SUFFER BECAUSE OF ANTI-GAY PREJUDICE, NOT
BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE.</H3>
<P>Teen years are a stressful time of rapid development into adulthood.  That
passage can be especially stressful for young people beginning to realize their
gay, lesbian or bisexual orientation, because they face anti-gay prejudice.  If
youth wondering about their sexual orientation or coming to terms with a gay or
bisexual orientation are isolated from supportive peers and adults, those youth
will often suffer from lack of self-esteem and self-worth and may tend toward
self-destructive behavior, including drug use and suicide.  Isolated gay youth
have a hard time concentrating on their education, leading many to drop out.</P>
<P>Such problems develop not because homosexuality or bisexuality is a
pathology -- for these are merely normal variations in human sexual orientation.
 Rather, isolated youth dealing with sexual orientation issues internalize the
prevailing anti-gay sentiments in schools and in society and, based on little
information, often judge themselves extremely harshly.</P>
<P>Student groups help diminish feelings of isolation and help build
self-esteem for their members. Student-initiated group discussions, social
events, and political organizing are a safe and healthy means of working through
what for many is otherwise a difficult and alienating time.</P>
<H3>VII.  GAY-RELATED CLUBS DO NOT PROMOTE SEX, NOR DO THEY FOSTER ADOLESCENT
SEXUALITY ANY MORE THAN HETEROSEXUALLY-ORIENTED TEENAGE ACTIVITIES DO.</H3>
<P>Contrary to the wholly unsubstantiated arguments of opponents, gay/straight
alliances do not cause young people to become involved in sexual activity
earlier than they otherwise would, or to &quot;choose&quot; a sexual orientation
that would otherwise not be their orientation.</P>
<P>A student club focusing on sexual orientation issues no more causes sexual
activity than do student clubs such as a glee club, a math club, or a Young
Republican club.  All clubs, and many other circumstances, bring teenagers

together to meet and get to know one another, sometimes leading to dating and
other appropriate adolescent socializing.  That is far from, however, bringing
about sexual intercourse before a young person is ready.  If schools sponsor
athletic exhibitions, cheerleading, dances and proms without concerns about
promoting sex, it is difficult to see how allowing a gay-straight student
alliance to meet for discussions would promote sex. </P>
<P>Any decision about actually beginning to be sexually active is made by each
individual, based on many highly personal factors.  Rather than playing a
harmful role, gay/straight alliances and similar groups dedicated to learning
about sexual orientation assist youth in making intelligent choices about their
present and future behavior.  If students can talk openly about and feel good
about their identity, they will be less likely to feel that they have to
discover their identity in an uninformed and clandestine manner, which may
involve risky sexual behavior.  Instead, they will be informed and secure enough
to make good decisions, which may include abstinence.</P>
<H3>VIII.  SCHOOLS DO NOT CREATE HETEROSEXUAL OR HOMOSEXUAL STUDENT IDENTITIES.</H3>
<P>There is no empirical support for the notion, advanced by some who oppose
the open and truthful discussion of sexuality, that some adolescents are &quot;waverers&quot;
and can be influenced during their teenage years to adopt a heterosexual, rather
than a gay or bisexual orientation.  While adolescents only gradually come to
realize their sexual nature and their sexual orientation, and may go through a
period of not being sure of their personal make-up, this gradual realization of
an aspect of their identity certainly does not mean that sexual orientation is
open to manipulation by the policies of school officials.  Sexual orientation is
a very deep-seated personal characteristic that appears to be fixed by early
childhood and determined by the complex interaction of genetic, biological,
psychological, and environmental forces.  Even if manipulation were possible,
moreover, a government plan to change such a central aspect of individuals'
personalities would be an unprecedented, Orwellian interference with individual
liberty.</P>
<H3>IX.  NO PARTICULAR SEXUAL ORIENTATION CAN BE EQUATED WITH CRIMINALIZED
SEXUAL ACTS.</H3>
<P>No particular sexual orientation can be equated with particular sexual acts
that are criminalized in some states and often referred to under the catch-all
term: &quot;sodomy.&quot;  Sodomy, typically defined to include oral and anal
sex, describes conduct in which adults of all sexual orientations may engage;
indeed, studies show that virtually all Americans, whether gay or straight,
participate in one or both of those sexual behaviors during their adult years. 
By contrast, sexual orientation concerns the gender of the sexual partners one
is attracted to.  One's orientation can be felt, acknowledged and discussed
without any sexual behavior, whether sodomy or otherwise, taking place.</P>
<P>Thus, discouraging the open discussion of homosexuality or bisexuality among
teenagers cannot be justified with some sweeping reference to &quot;criminality&quot;
or &quot;criminal behavior,&quot; as those who would discourage gay/straight
alliances and similar groups attempt to do.</P>
<H3>X.  GAY/STRAIGHT STUDENT CLUBS ARE NOT THE ONLY STUDENT GROUPS THAT MIGHT
ADDRESS HOMOSEXUALITY OR SEXUALITY IN GENERAL.</H3>
<P>Gay/straight alliances are not the only student clubs that discuss issues
related to sexual orientation or sexuality more generally.  Religious clubs may
discuss their religious perspective on gay men and lesbians, which might be
supportive or antagonistic.  Political clubs may discuss the current debates
about same-sex marriage, or gays in the military, again from a positive or
negative perspective.  The science club may delve into the scientific research
around the origins of sexual orientation.  All contribute to a vibrant &quot;open
forum&quot; of safe, after-school activity.</P>
<P>The proper role for school officials, as mandated by the First Amendment and
the Equal Access Act, is to remain neutral in this student-initiated debate,
investigation and discussion.  Schools cannot deem a perspective of some
students' &quot;dangerous&quot; and ban those students' views to &quot;protect&quot;
young people.  The notion of silencing dangerous ideas is incompatible with our
free political system.  Though teachers and others of course must look out for
students' physical well-being, that protective role cannot extend to policing
the content of student-to-student communication.</P>
<H3>XI.  SCHOOLS RETAIN ALL CONTROL OVER THE CURRICULUM AT THE SAME TIME AS
THEY ENCOURAGE AND MAINTAIN AN OPEN FORUM FOR STUDENT ASSOCIATIONS.</H3>
<P>Student-initiated groups that meet on school grounds during
non-instructional time are separate and distinct from the curriculum.  The
groups at issue are not school-sponsored or -endorsed; they represent only the
interests and views of the students involved.</P>
<P>School boards, officials and teachers, on the other hand, remain free to
design and implement a curriculum that they determine best meets students'
educational needs.  Neither the federal Equal Access Act nor gay/straight
alliances interfere in any way with schools' ability to focus the content of the

curriculum as they see fit.</P>

THE LAW FOR WOMEN IN STATE-FUNDED HIGHER EDUCATION?</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This term, more than 40 years after its decisions in Brown v. Board of
Education and Sweatt v. Painter, the Supreme Court will hear argument in the
case of Commonwealth of Virginia v. United States, often referred to as the VMI
case, which presents the question whether a state can deny unique state-funded
higher educational opportunities to women solely on the basis of their sex.  The
case also poses the question whether the creation of a separate state-funded
women's institution which is admittedly not equal to the challenged men's
institution provides a sufficient remedy for a violation of the equal protection
clause.  Finally, this case presents the Court, primarily through the amicus
brief co-authored by the Women's Rights Project, with the historic opportunity
to decide whether discrimination on the basis of sex should be subject to the
highest level of constitutional scrutiny, strict scrutiny, rather than the
existing intermediate scrutiny standard.</P>
<P>Below is a brief background of the VMI case, and a summary of the briefs
filed with the Supreme Court. </P>
<P><B>Background of the Case</B></P>
<P>In 1990, the United States sued the Commonwealth of Virginia and others
challenging the state-funded Virginia Military Institute's [&quot;VMI&quot;]
males-only admissions policy as violative of the equal protection clause.  In
1992, the Fourth Circuit found that VMI's exclusion of women was not
substantially related to an important governmental interest and therefore
violated the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee.  While
recognizing that &quot;some women would qualify for and benefit from&quot; VMI,
the Fourth Circuit refused to order the admission of women as a remedy for the
constitutional violation.  The Commonwealth of Virginia then paid approximately
$6 million to nearby Mary Baldwin College, a private women's college, to create
a publicly funded women-only leadership program, the Virginia Women's Institute
for Leadership [&quot;VWIL&quot;].  In the Spring of 1995, the Fourth Circuit in
a 2-1 decision upheld Virginia's proposed remedy, the VWIL program, which was

designed for women's alleged &quot;special&quot; educational, psychological, and

developmental needs.  VWIL rejects the military model of VMI as inappropriate
for educating women, providing instead a cooperative confidence building model
deemed appropriate by VMI, VWIL, and their supporters for the &quot;different
educational needs of most women.&quot;  The Fourth Circuit upheld the exclusion
of women from VMI on the basis that the admission of a single woman would
destroy VMI's &quot;methodology&quot; and, while conceding that some women
qualify for and would benefit from VMI, that VMI was not appropriate for &quot;most
women.&quot;</P>
<P>The Supreme Court granted certiorari on the cross petitions for review filed
by the United States and the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Virginia challenges the
Fourth Circuit's liability determination while the United States challenges the
adequacy of VWIL, which the Court of Appeals' dissent characterized as a &quot;pale
shadow&quot; of VMI, as a remedy for the constitutional violation.   Oral
argument is set for January 17, 1996.</P>
<P><B>Brief of Petitioner United States of America</B></P>
<P>The U.S. argues that, as the Fourth Circuit correctly found, under
Mississippi University v. Hogan(1), VMI's male-only admission policy violates
the 14th Amendment.  The remedy adopted by the Fourth Circuit also excludes
women on the basis of sex, not individual qualifications.  The U.S. argues that,
contrary to the Fourth Circuit's remedial decision, the only remedy that can
provide women the equal opportunity they have been denied is to open admission
to women.  The small changes needed to accommodate women at VMI, such as
parallel physical training standards, separate bathrooms, etc., would not
fundamentally alter the functioning of the institution.  </P>
<P>It is undisputed that no college in Virginia offers women the same or
similar type of program as men are offered at VMI.  Not only does barring women
deny them the benefits of a VMI education, it also denies them the very real and
substantial lifelong career and social benefits which accrue to those who attend
VMI.  A separate new women's institution cannot remedy the denial of admission
to an institution which has been in existence for 150 years and which has an
important history, reputation, prestige and strong and influential alumni
network.  The denial of similar intangibles to blacks resulting from the
exclusion from white-only institutions mandated desegregation.    </P>
<P>The U.S. argues that contrary to Hogan, Virginia's remedy &quot;reflects
archaic and stereotypic notions.&quot;  Hogan invalidated a single sex
admissions policy because it &quot;tend[ed] to perpetuate the stereotyped view
of nursing as an exclusively woman's job.&quot;  Exclusion of women from VMI
(and creation of a separate and inferior women's-only program) perpetuates
exactly the same type of impermissible stereotypes that women are not suited for
rigorous military training, military service or leadership, particularly in
male-dominated environments.  The design of the remedy itself embodies
impermissible sex-based stereotypes about the different emotional and
educational needs of women and men.     Rather than looking at individual
abilities, as commanded by the Fourteenth Amendment, the court improperly used
sex as proxy for ability and looked at women at as group rather than as
individuals.  Even if sex stereotypes are somewhat based in reality, the U.S.
argues relying on J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., use of them as the basis for
the allocation of rights and benefits is impermissible because it continues
forward historical sex bias and law cannot be used to restrict men and women to
socially assigned spheres.</P>
<P>The U.S. also argues that while the remedy fails under intermediate
scrutiny, the exclusion of women from VMI should be subject to strict scrutiny,
the same level of scrutiny applicable to classifications on the basis of race.</P>
<P><B>Brief of the Commonwealth of Virginia, et al.</B></P>
<P>Virginia's initial brief argues that the Fourth Circuit wrongly applied
Hogan when it found that VMI's male-only admissions policy violated equal
protection.  Virginia argues that the Fourth Circuit's decision will wrongly
prevent states from developing educational programs to meet the &quot;special
needs&quot; of its citizens on the basis of sex and disallow the development of
single-sex education for one sex absent a parallel program for the other.    
</P>
<P>Virginia argues that providing diverse educational opportunities in general
and single-sex education in particular are important government objectives,(2)
that single-sex education provides important benefits and provides some students
with a better learning environment than co-educational settings.  Virginia uses
the examples of private single-sex schools and public secondary schools for
African-American boys to bolster its argument that women can be constitutionally
excluded from VMI.  </P>
<P>Virginia relies on the testimony of educators to bolster its argument that
women and men have different educational needs which validates the offering of
different types of state-funded programs on the basis of sex.</P>
<P>According to Virginia, since single-sex education is in itself an important
governmental objective, [as evidenced primarily by the VMI board's decision to
remain all male], then ipso facto VMI's exclusion of women is substantially
related to that objective and the exclusion satisfies Hogan.  To admit women
would by definition, Virginia argues, frustrate the state's goal to provide
single-sex education.        </P>
<P>Virginia argues that the admission of women would drastically alter VMI,
arguing that changes such as parallel physical standards and increased privacy
would be incompatible with VMI's methodology.  Virginia argues that requiring
VMI to admit women would deny men the benefits of single-sex education and VMI's
method of education without extending that benefit to women.  </P>
<P>Virginia adopts the Fourth Circuit's formulation that women need not be
granted equal educational opportunities, that &quot;substantively comparable&quot;
opportunities are sufficient to satisfy equal protection.  It is a
misinterpretation of Hogan, argues Virginia, to require that, absent significant
demand by women as a class, an individual woman be provided access to all the
educational opportunities available to an individual man.  Arguing that only
relatively few women are interested in a VMI education, Virginia argues that the
state should not be required to provide this type of education to any woman. 
Virginia argues that an application requiring equal opportunities for women in
public education could lead to the barring of government funding to private
single-sex schools.  It also argues that funding for battered women's shelters
could be found unconstitutional if parallel programs were not provided.</P>
<P><B>Amici Curiae Brief of ACLU, National Women's Law Center et al.</B></P>
<P>This brief primarily argues that while the VMI remedy clearly fails under
the intermediate level of equal protection scrutiny, that the Supreme Court
should use this case as a vehicle to decide that sex-based discrimination must
be subject to strict scrutiny.  The brief argues that, as the result in this
case demonstrates, the intermediate scrutiny standard has proven unworkable as
applied to gender-based classifications and has resulted in incorrect decisions
because of reliance on gender-based stereotypes.  We also argue that the Court's
recent decision in Adarand v. Pena applying strict scrutiny to race-based
affirmation-action programs indicates that in practice and policy such programs
for women will also be subject to heightened scrutiny.  As a result
discrimination against women must receive the same level of scrutiny as programs
intended to remedy such discrimination.  We argue that given that sex is an
immutable characteristic unrelated to ability, the long history and continuing
practice of sex discrimination, and the underrepresentation of women in the
political process that it is appropriate that sex-based classifications be
subject to strict scrutiny.</P>
<P><B>Amici Briefs by Private Women's Colleges</B></P>
<P>Two briefs, on opposing sides of the litigation, were submitted by private
women's colleges.  An issue of concern in this litigation and one exploited by
Virginia has been the impact of a decision requiring VMI to admit women on the
continued viability of private single-sex and traditionally African-American
colleges.  </P>
<P>Twenty-six women's colleges filed a brief in support of the United States,
arguing that the male-only admissions policy of VMI as a publicly funded school
violates equal protection and the Fourth Circuit's remedy also violates equal
protection because it justifies differential treatment of women and men on the
basis of impermissible gender-based stereotypes.  The amici further argue that
invalidation of VMI's policy will not threaten the continued existence of
private women's colleges because the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to them
and the colleges' tax-exempt status is not threatened by the public policy
requirement enunciated in Bob Jones University v. United States.</P>
<P>Three private women's colleges weighed in on the side of VMI, arguing that
publicly funded sex-segregated schools of higher education are justified due to
the educational benefits conferred to women by single-sex education.    </P>
<P><B>Amici Brief of Scientists, Scholars, Educators, and Professional
Organizations</B></P>
<P>This brief addressed scientific issues of gendered patterns of
psychological, emotional, and educational development raised in this case,
including research of some of the amici, particularly Carol Gilligan author of
In A Different Voice, relied on by the courts below to support the separate but
unequal remedy.</P>
<P><B>Amici Brief of Past and Present Military Personnel in Support of the
United States</B></P>
<P>This brief, organized and substantially written by the Women's Rights
Project, was filed on behalf of approximately 20 past and present members of the
armed forces and support organizations.  The amici were an illustrious group,
including six women who were in the first class of women to graduate from West
Point, several women who graduated at the top of their class at West Point and
the Naval Academy, several retired generals, and such well-known figures as Dr.
Margarethe Cammemeyer and Major Rhonda Cornum, one of two American women POWs in
the Gulf War.  The main points raised in this brief were that women have
demonstrated their ability to serve with distinction in the military and
military academies rebutting the Fourth Circuit's conclusion that VMI was too
tough for women and that the integration of women had not destroyed the military
or the academies.  The brief also discussed how VMI had at one time resisted
race integration on much the same grounds that it now resists sex integration. 
Finally, the brief discussed how the remedy for women, VWIL, would not
adequately prepare women for a military career.</P>
<P><B>Amicus Brief of Nancy Mellette in Support of the United States</B></P>
<P>This brief was submitted on behalf of the young South Carolina woman who
intervened in the pending action against The Citadel after Shannon Faulkner
withdrew.  Since the Fourth Circuit's decisions in VMI have provided the
controlling authority in The Citadel case and since Mellette seeks to dismantle
The Citadel's male-only admissions policy, she has a substantial interest in the
Supreme Court's review of the VWIL remedy.  Mellette argues that the VWIL remedy
itself violates equal protection. </P>
<P><B>Amici Brief of Employment Law Center, Equal Rights Advocates, Inc.,
several women law professors, etc. in Support of the United States</B></P>
<P>This brief argues that while the VWIL remedy cannot survive intermediate
scrutiny, the Court should use this opportunity to adopt strict scrutiny for
gender-based discrimination.  The brief further argues that the Court should
reject its jurisprudence of &quot;consistent&quot; application of the strict
scrutiny standard to both invidious and remedial classifications most recently
discussed in Adarand.  Amici argue that strict scrutiny should be limited to
invidious classifications, while the Court should recognize the continuing need
for remedial classifications and subject them to a lesser standard of scrutiny.</P>
<P>(1)  Hogan, applying intermediate scrutiny which permits the use of
sex-based classifications only if the classification &quot;serves important
governmental objectives&quot; and is &quot;substantially related to the
achievement of those objectives,&quot; held that a state cannot prohibit
enrollment in a state institution of higher education on the basis of sex
without an &quot;exceedingly persuasive justification.&quot; </P>
<P>(2)  In its constitutional argument, Virginia blurs the distinction between
public and private colleges, arguing that it has a long history of support for
single-sex education, through the state-funded VMI and through tuition
assistance to students who attend private single-sex schools.  As the state
admits, however, at the time the U.S. sued over VMI's exclusion of women, VMI
was the only single-sex public college in Virginia.  Virginia argues that since
the state disproportionately provides tuition assistance for women attending
private women's colleges that VMI's male-only policy serves to equalize the
single-sex opportunities for men and women. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<h2>
                Religion In The Public Schools:<br>
                A Joint Statement Of Current Law</h2>

</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
     The Constitution permits much private religious activity in and
about the public schools.  Unfortunately, this aspect of constitutional
law is not as well known as it should be.  Some say that the Supreme
Court has declared the public schools "religion-free zones" or that the
law is so murky that school officials cannot know what is legally
permissible.  The former claim is simply wrong.  And as to the latter,
while there are some difficult issues, much has been settled.  It is also
unfortunately true that public school officials, due to their busy
schedules, may not be as fully aware of this body of law as they could
be.  As a result, in some school districts some of these rights are not
being observed.
<P>
     The organizations whose names appear below span the
ideological, religious and political spectrum. They nevertheless share a
commitment both to the freedom of religious practice and to the
separation of church and state such freedom requires.  In that spirit, we
offer this statement of consensus on current law as an aid to parents,
educators and students.
<P>
     Many of the organizations listed below are actively involved in
litigation about religion in the schools.  On some of the issues
discussed in this summary, some of the organizations have urged the
courts to reach positions different than they did.  Though there are
signatories on both sides which have and will press for different
constitutional treatments of some of the topics discussed below,  they
all agree that the following  is an accurate statement of what the law
currently is.
<P><center>
<H4>                    Student Prayers</H4>
</center>
<P>
1.   Students have the right to pray individually or in groups or to
     discuss their religious views with their peers so long as they are
     not disruptive.  Because the Establishment Clause does not
     apply to purely private speech, students enjoy the right to read
     their Bibles or other scriptures, say grace before meals, pray
     before tests, and discuss religion with other willing student
     listeners.  In the classroom students have the right to pray
     quietly except when required to be actively engaged in school
     activities (e.g., students may not decide to pray just as a teacher
     calls on them).  In informal settings, such as the cafeteria or in
     the halls, students may pray either audibly or silently, subject to
     the same rules of order as apply to other speech in these
     locations. However, the right to engage in voluntary prayer does
     not include, for example, the right to have a captive audience
     listen or to compel other students to participate.
<P><center>
<H4>               Graduation Prayer and Baccalaureates</H4>
</center>
<P>
2.   School officials may not mandate or organize prayer at
     graduation, nor may they organize a religious baccalaureate
     ceremony.  If the school generally rents out its facilities to private
     groups, it must rent them out on the same terms, and on a first-
     come first-served basis, to organizers of privately sponsored
     religious baccalaureate services, provided that the school does
     not extend preferential treatment to the baccalaureate ceremony
     and the school disclaims official endorsement of the program.
<P>
3.   The courts have reached conflicting conclusions under the
     federal Constitution on student-initiated prayer at graduation.
     Until the issue is authoritatively resolved, schools should ask
     their lawyers what rules apply in their area.
<P><center>
<h4>
             Official Participation or Encouragement<br>
                      of Religious Activity
</h4></center>
<P>
4.   Teachers and school administrators, when acting in those
     capacities, are  representatives of the state, and, in those
     capacities, are themselves prohibited  from encouraging or
     soliciting student religious or anti-religious activity.   Similarly,
     when acting in their official capacities, teachers may not engage
     in religious activities with their students.  However, teachers may
     engage in private religious activity in faculty lounges.
<P><center>
<H4>                     Teaching About Religion</H4></center>
<P>
5.   Students may be taught about religion, but public schools may
     not teach religion.  As the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly
     said, "[i]t might well be said that one's education is not complete
     without a study of comparative religion, or the history of religion
     and its relationship to the advancement of civilization."  It would
     be difficult to teach art, music, literature and most social studies
     without considering religious influences.
<P>
     The history of religion, comparative religion, the Bible (or other
     scripture)-as-literature (either as a separate course or within
     some other existing course), are all permissible public school
     subjects.  It is both permissible and desirable to teach objectively
     about the role of religion in the history of the United States and
     other countries.  One can teach that the Pilgrims came to this
     country with  a particular religious vision, that Catholics and
     others have been subject to persecution or that many of those
     participating in the abolitionist, women's suffrage and civil rights
     movements had religious motivations.
<P>
6.   These same rules apply to the recurring controversy surrounding
     theories of evolution.  Schools may teach about explanations of
     life on earth, including religious ones (such as "creationism"), in
     comparative religion or social studies classes.  In science class,
     however, they may present only genuinely scientific critiques of,
     or evidence for, any explanation of life on earth, but not religious
     critiques (beliefs unverifiable by scientific methodology). Schools
     may not refuse to teach evolutionary theory in order to avoid
     giving offense to religion nor may they circumvent these rules by
     labeling as science an article of religious faith.  Public schools
     must not teach as scientific fact or theory any religious doctrine,
     including "creationism," although any genuinely scientific
     evidence for or against any explanation of life may be taught.
     Just as they may neither advance nor inhibit any religious
     doctrine, teachers should not ridicule, for example, a student's
     religious explanation for life on earth.
<P><center>
<H4>                 Student Assignments and Religion</H4></center>
<P>
7.   Students may express their religious beliefs in the form of
     reports, homework and artwork, and such expressions are
     constitutionally protected.  Teachers may not reject or correct
     such submissions simply because they include a religious
     symbol or address religious themes. Likewise, teachers may not
     require students to modify, include or excise religious views in
     their assignments, if germane.  These assignments should be
     judged by ordinary academic standards of substance, relevance,
     appearance and grammar.
<P>
8.   Somewhat more problematic from a legal point of view are other
     public expressions of religious views in the classroom.
     Unfortunately for school officials, there are traps on either side of
     this issue, and it is possible that litigation will result no matter
     what course is taken.  It is easier to describe the settled cases
     than to state clear rules of law. Schools must carefully steer
     between the claims of student speakers who assert a right to
     express themselves on religious subjects and the asserted rights
     of student listeners to be free of unwelcome religious persuasion
     in a public school classroom.
<P><blockquote>
     a.   Religious or anti-religious remarks made in the ordinary
          course of classroom discussion or student presentations
          are permissible and constitute a protected right.  If in a
          sex education class a student remarks that abortion
          should be illegal because God has prohibited it, a teacher
          should not silence the remark, ridicule it, rule it out of
          bounds or endorse it, any more than a teacher may
          silence a student's religiously-based comment in favor of
          choice.
<P>
     b.   If a class assignment calls for an oral presentation on a
          subject of the student's choosing, and, for example, the
          student responds by conducting a religious service, the
          school has the right -- as well as the duty -- to prevent
          itself from being used as a church.  Other students are not
          voluntarily in attendance and cannot be forced to become
          an unwilling congregation.
<P>
     c.   Teachers may rule out-of-order religious remarks that are
          irrelevant to the subject at hand.  In a discussion of
          Hamlet's sanity, for example, a student may not interject
          views on creationism.</blockquote>
<P><center>
<H4>                   Distribution of Religious Literature</H4></center>
<P>
9.   Students have the right to distribute religious literature to their
     schoolmates, subject to those reasonable time, place, and
     manner or other constitutionally- acceptable restrictions imposed
     on the distribution of all non-school literature.  Thus, a school
     may confine distribution of all literature to a particular table at
     particular times.  It may not single out religious literature for
     burdensome regulation.
<P>
10.  Outsiders may not be given access to the classroom to distribute
     religious or anti-religious literature.  No court has yet considered
     whether, if all other community groups are permitted to distribute
     literature in common areas of public schools, religious groups
     must be allowed to do so on equal terms subject to reasonable
     time, place and manner restrictions.
<P><center>
<H4>                           "See You at the Pole"</H4></center>

<P>
11.    Student participation in before- or after-school events, such as
       "see you at the pole,"  is permissible.  School officials, acting in
       an official capacity, may neither discourage nor encourage
       participation in such an event.
<P>
<center>
<H4>                          Religious Persuasion Versus Religious Harassment</H4></center>
<P>
12.    Students have the right to speak to, and attempt to persuade,
       their peers about religious topics just as they do with regard to
       political topics.  But school officials should intercede to stop
       student religious speech if it turns into religious harassment
       aimed at a student or a small group of students.  While it is
       constitutionally permissible for a student to approach another and
       issue an invitation to attend church, repeated invitations in the
       face of a request to stop constitute harassment.  Where this line
       is to be drawn in particular cases will depend on the age of the
       students and other circumstances.
<P><center>
<H4>                             Equal Access Act</H4></center>
<P>
13.  Student religious clubs in secondary schools must be permitted
     to meet and to have equal access to campus media to announce
     their meetings, if a school receives federal funds and permits any
     student non-curricular club to meet during non-instructional time.
     This is the command of the Equal Access Act.  A non-curricular
     club is any club not related directly to a subject taught or
     soon-to-be taught in the school.  Although schools have the right
     to ban all non-curriculum clubs, they may not dodge the law's
     requirement by the expedient of declaring all clubs
     curriculum-related.  On the other hand, teachers may not actively
     participate in club activities and "non-school persons" may not
     control or regularly attend club meeting.
<P>
     The Act's constitutionality has been upheld  by the Supreme
     Court, rejecting claims that the Act violates the Establishment
     Clause.  The Act's requirements are described in more detail in
     The Equal Access Act and the Public Schools: Questions and
     Answers on the Equal Access Act*, a pamphlet published by a
     broad spectrum of religious and civil liberties groups.
<P><center>
<H4>                          Religious Holidays</H4></center>
<P>
14.  Generally, public schools may teach about religious holidays,
     and may celebrate the secular aspects of the holiday and
     objectively teach about their religious aspects.  They may not
     observe the holidays as religious events.  Schools should
     generally excuse students who do not wish to participate in
     holiday events.  Those interested in further details should see
     Religious Holidays in the Public Schools: Questions and
     Answers*, a pamphlet published by a broad spectrum of religious
     and civil liberties groups.
<P><center>
<H4>             Excusal From Religiously-Objectionable Lessons</H4></center>
<P>
15.  Schools enjoy substantial discretion to excuse individual students
     from lessons which are objectionable to that student or to his or
     her parent on the basis of  religion.  Schools can exercise that
     authority in ways which would defuse many conflicts over
     curriculum content.  If it is proved that particular lessons
     substantially burden a student's free exercise of religion and if
     the school cannot prove a compelling interest in requiring
     attendance the school would be legally required to excuse the
     student.
<P><center>
<H4>                           Teaching Values</H4></center>
<P>
16.  Schools may teach civic virtues, including honesty, good
     citizenship, sportsmanship, courage,  respect for the rights and
     freedoms of others, respect for persons and their property,
     civility,  the dual virtues of moral conviction and tolerance and
     hard work.  Subject to whatever rights of excusal exist (see #15
     above) under the federal Constitution and state law, schools may
     teach sexual abstinence and contraception; whether and how
     schools teach these sensitive subjects is a matter of educational
     policy.  However, these may not be taught as religious tenets.
     The mere fact that most, if not all, religions also teach these
     values does not make it unlawful to teach them.
<P><center>
<H4>                             Student Garb</H4></center>
<P>
17.  Religious messages on T-shirts and the like may not be singled
     out for  suppression.  Students may wear religious attire, such as
     yarmulkes and head scarves, and they may not be forced to
     wear gym clothes that they regard, on religious grounds, as
     immodest.
<P><center>
<H4>                             Released Time</H4></center>
<P>
18.  Schools have the discretion to dismiss students to off-premises
     religious  instruction, provided that schools do not encourage or
     discourage participation or penalize those who do not attend.

20.
     Schools may not allow  religious instruction by outsiders on
     premises during the school day.

<h2>
THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT WANTS AMERICA
</h2>
<h4><i>
<font color="#ff0033">By John M. Swomley</font>
</h4></i>
</center>
<br>
<blockquote>
<P>
     Pat Robertson and his "Christian Coalition" have declared war on a
large array of organizations deemed by them to be "irreligious" or
"liberal." The list of the embattled, which the ACLU heads, includes the
American Jewish Congress, People for the American Way, the National
Organization for Women and several churches.
<P>
     Many people, noting the Coalition's agenda against homosexuality,
abortion, separation of church and state, and women's rights, regard
Robertson-and-company as a disruptive element on the American political
scene, but one that is temporary and ultimately bound to fail.  That
interpretation is simplistic.
<P>
     The Christian Coalition is the largest of many right wing religious
groups whose members want to reorder United States political affairs
under the authority of a "Christian" government.  Their overarching
philosophy, alternately called "Christian Reconstruction" and "Dominion
Theology," was first articulated in 1973 by Rousas John Rushdoony in
Institutes of Biblical Law.  That philosophy is nurtured by the Coalition
on Revival (COR), a secretive inner circle whose steering committee
includes most of the nation's right wing Christian leaders.  This hard
core, which promotes the unifying ideology of the Christian right, is led
by Dr. Jay Grimstead.
<P>
     Strongly influenced by COR and its credo, Pat Robertson renamed his
CBN (for Christian Broadcasting Network) University, Regent University,
explaining that "a regent is one who governs in the absence of a
sovereign." Someday, he said, "we will rule and reign along with our
sovereign, Jesus Christ." Toward that day, Regent is training graduate
students in education, religion, law and communications to build
theological and political alliances of ready-to-rule folk.  Robertson's
more immediate goal, control of the Republican Party, is seen as a
necessary step in pursuit of the ultimate prize: a "Christian" United
States -- meaning his brand of Christianity.
<P>
     Robertson's writings and speeches reflect essentially theocratic
models.  In his 1991 book, The New World Order, he writes: 
<P>
<blockquote>
     "The founders of America at Plymouth Rock and in the Massachusetts 
Colony felt that they were organizing a society based on the Ten 
Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount .... They tried their best to
model their institutions of governmental order after the Bible."
</blockquote>
<P>
Of course, the former clergyman romanticizes here.  The early American
leaders to whom he refers were people who burned "witches," hanged
Quakers, slaughtered Native Americans, held Africans in bondage and taxed
the populace to support religion.
<P>
   Summarizing the colonial period, Robertson writes,
<blockquote>
<P>
      "... for almost two hundred years prior to our Constitution, all of
the leadership of this nation had been steeped with biblical principles of
the Old and New Testaments.  Their new order was a nation founded squarely
on concepts of the nature of God, the nature of man, the role of the
family and the moral order as established by the God of Jacob."
</blockquote><P>
     What Robertson is extolling, among other things, is clerical control
of politics.  In colonial Massachusetts and Connecticut, reports William
Warren Sweet in The Story of Religions in America, preachers' political
influence was such that no one could be admitted to church membership
without their consent, and voting in those colonies "was limited to
church members." Sweet also describes a morals squad: "The tithing man ...
was a township official who assisted the constable in watching over the
morals of the community.  There was one such official for every ten
families, who ... was on the lookout for Sabbath breaking, tippling,
gaming, and idleness."
<P>
     Pat Robertson claims that "...the Supreme Court of the supposedly
Christian United States guaranteed the moral collapse of this nation when
it forbade children in the public schools to pray to the god of Jacob, to
learn of His moral law or even to view in their classrooms the heart of
the law, the Ten Commandments." Actually, the Supreme Court has never
banned private prayer if performed silently in class or in the cafeteria
over lunch.  In 1962, in Engle v. Vitale, the court banned
school-sponsored prayer; and in 1963, in the Pennsylvania case Abington
Township v. Schempp, it banned Bible reading as worship.  The Court has
permitted objectively taught courses on the Bible as literature, on the
philosophy or sociology of religion, and on comparative religion.  It has
also allowed religious clubs to meet after instructional hours if other
extra-curricular clubs are permitted to meet.  Moreover, many states did
not even have school-sponsored prayers or Bible readings prior to 1962.
<P>
     The Christian Coalition has become a force in American politics,
providing the margin for Jesse Helms' re-election.  Its Christian
Broadcasting Network has 1,485 radio stations and 336 television stations
(numbers as of 1989), with Robertson's "700 Club" -- annual income, about
$140 million -- airing daily on TV.  In close touch with Robertson are
other groups like James Dobson's Focus on the Family, which employs about
1,000 people, publishes eight periodicals and broadcasts on more than
1,500 radio stations.
<P>
     Although the bulk of Robertson's support comes from fundamentalist
Protestants and Catholics, not all fundamentalists and evangelicals
support his politics or his theology.  Thus, the ACLU, in coalition with
both religious and secular organizations, should strive to reach as many
people as possible with its message of church-state separation and other
civil liberties values.

the board's Church-State Committee.

<center><h2>
ACLU Position Statement on "Creation-science"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
For seventy-five years, the American Civil Liberties Union has been
dedicated to upholding First Amendment protections of civil liberties. 
Consistent with the requirements of the Establishment Clause, the ACLU
policy on religion in public schools states that "...any program of
religious indoctrination -- direct or indirect -- in the public schools or
by use of public resources is a violation of the constitutional principle
of separation of church and state and must be opposed...."  In 1980, the
Board of Directors further clarified this policy by stating, "ACLU also
opposes the inculcation of religious doctrines even if they are presented
as alternatives to scientific theories."  "Creation science" in all its
guises, for example "abrupt appearance theory"  or "intelligent design
theory", is just such religious doctrine. 
<P>
Among the problems "creation-science"  creates in the academic environment
is the foreclosure of scientific inquiry.  The unifying principle of
"creationism" is not the law of nature, but divinity.  A divine
explanation of natural data is not subject to experiment, it cannot be
proved untrue, it cannot be disputed by any human means.  Creationism
necessarily rests on the unobservable; it can exist only in the ambiance
of faith.  Faith -- belief that does not rest on logic or on evidence --
has no role in scientific inquiry. 
<P>
The constitutional defect of any law or policy requiring the teaching of
creationism, or of "evidence against evolution," is not that it requires
instruction about facts which coincide with a religious belief, but that
it requires instruction in one religious belief as the unifying
explanation of facts.  This unifying concept is not a secular topic such
as biology, chemistry, art, phonics, or literature which is familiar to
the elementary and secondary school curricula.  Instead, teachers are
required to identify, organize, or teach facts and inferences supporting a
specific belief - " special creation" . To require public schools to
marshal "evidences" and "inferences" in service of one religious belief,
or to impose an embargo on a scientific theory that Fundamentalists
dislike, is not to use religious works "for the teaching of secular
subjects," (Abington School Dist. v. Schempp), but to place "the power,
prestige and financial support of government...behind a particular
religious belief" (Engel v. Vitale) The year-by-year, school-by-school,
and teacher-by-teacher decision-making on whether and how to imbue
"creationism" into the sciences and humanities promises continuing anguish
in the educational community and assures inordinate involvement of
religious groups in the affairs of government. 
<P>
In our society, government is not permitted to instruct a child in
religion, because it is not the government's job to promote a religious
form of truth.  No provision of the Constitution so firmly assures the
essential freedom of the individual as does the Establishment Clause.  The
provision recognizes that choices about the ultimate meaning of life must
be made in the private recesses of the conscience and not in the earthly
controversies of political power.  Were every person in this country of
the same faith, the Establishment Clause would serve as a powerful
expression that humans must decide their relationship to God, not at the
bidding of the state, but at the calling of the soul.  That we are a
nation of many religions does not alter this basic function of the Clause,
it only enhances the need for vigilance against state manipulation of
belief. 
<P>
Vigilance requires firm and consistent opposition to every effort to use
the nation's schools to teach any biblical text, including Genesis, as
literal truth, either directly or disguised as "alternative" science.  To
reject creationism as science is to defend the most basic principles of
academic integrity and religious liberty.

     <h4>Following is the transcript of "America's Constitutional Heritage:<br>
Religion and Our Public Schools." </h4>
<img src="/graphics/rbline.gif">
<P></center>
<H4>Reverend W.W. Finlator:</H4>
<P>
     Hello. I'm Reverend W.W. Finlator. For 26 years I was the pastor of
Pullen Memorial Baptist Church here in Raleigh, North Carolina. Like many
of you, I am concerned about the crisis of values in our society. As a
minister, I know that religion is extremely important to many Americans.
But it is also one of the most private and individual aspects of our
everyday lives. 
<P>
     I share the widespread concern about the seeming lack of faith and
values in America and believe that the best way to strengthen these values
is to reach out to the next generation. My wife and I brought our three
children up in the Baptist Church and faith.  That was our privilege and
right as parents. Some people, however, want to take that right and
responsibility away from parents. They want to bring religion to our
children in another way. Not through parents at home, or in church, but
through the public schools. 
<P>
     Many of you, I am sure, have asked yourselves whether prayer belongs
in public schools. Many of you may be facing this issue right now in your
own communities. This issue can be complicated, with persuasive and
passionate arguments coming from all sides. In the next 20 minutes, you
will meet several courageous families who faced this issue head on as well
as experts who will give you more information about this crucial debate so
you can make the best decision for yourself, your children and your
schools. 
<P>
     The debate over the role of religion in the nation's public schools
is important because it raises many basic questions about our society and
its constitutional heritage, and whether the government should play any
role in telling people where, when and how to pray. 
<P>
     The founders of our nation strongly believed that government, whether
on the national or local level, should not become involved -- in any way
-- in religious activities.  They said government must not regulate
religion, conduct religious services or interfere in any way with church
activities. Our nation's founders believed that people should be free to
pursue their own religious beliefs without government interference. 
<P>
     I would like now to introduce you to Professor Douglas Laycock, a
distinguished constitutional scholar at the University of Texas Law
School.  We asked Professor Laycock to explain the historical reasons why
the founders of our great nation wanted to keep government out of all
religious matters. 
<P>
<H4>Professor Douglas Laycock:</H4>
<P>
     From the time of the Emperor Constantine which is the 4th century, to
nearly the time of the American Constitution, the assumption in European
society was everybody in the country had to have the same religion and the
religion they had to have was the King's religion. The King got to choose
and everybody got to follow him. 
<P>
     The Protestant Reformation of course, put that directly in issue and
for nearly 200 years in Europe you had civil war and international war,
basically between Protestants and Catholics.  The issue, Protestant v.
Catholic and the risk of a Catholic King, was a constant issue in English
politics which broke out into warfare repeatedly and many of the American
colonies were founded by people who fled that conflict in Europe. 
<P>
<H4>Rev. Finlator:</H4>
<P>
     Since the birth of this nation, we have debated the issue of
separation of church and state in one form or another. And I'm sure we'll
be debating it for a long time to come. In the end however, the debate
seems to end up in the same place.  Most Americans -- myself included --
don't want the government interfering in any of our most private affairs,
especially not our religion. 
<P>
     I'm a Baptist. My wife and I brought up our children as Baptists. We
didn't want them brought up in any other faith. And we didn't want anyone
else to take that responsibility away from us, especially not the
government. I'm sure that many of you feel the same way.  But when a
teacher leads a prayer in the public school, he or she usurps your role as
a parent.  This may not at first seem objectionable to you if you are a
Baptist and it's a Baptist prayer or tradition that's being practiced in
the school. But what if it were a Mormon prayer? Or a Jewish prayer?  Or a
Muslim prayer? A prayer that endorsed beliefs that offended you.  Would
you really want that in your school? Would you want your child forced to
participate in that? I wouldn't. But once you allow one form of prayer in
the school, you are inviting other forms of prayer in as well -- even
secular humanist or atheist prayers. 
<P>
     The subject of school sponsored prayer inevitably comes up every
spring during graduation.  It came up for Angie Willmore in May, 1993. 
<P>
Angie is from a religious, Mormon family. Her community of Rexburg, Idaho,
is predominantly Mormon. Because of this, Angie's graduating class thought
that praying during graduation would not hurt anyone.  But Angie felt
differently. She knew the Supreme Court had ruled only the year before
that prayers at graduation violated the Constitution, because, as Supreme
Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said, and I quote, "The Constitution forbids
the State to exact religious conformity from a student as the price of
attending her own high school graduation." Angie decided to protest the
prayer by walking out of her high school graduation. 
<P>
<H4>Angie Willmore:</H4>
<P>
     I'd almost decided to let it go just because there were a lot of
people there and then I saw Shane get up and start walking towards the
podium and I knew he was the one giving the prayer and I just I knew I
couldn't live with myself if I sat there and let it happen and didn't at
least let people know that someone did care that someone was opposed. And
the only thing I really wanted to do was to make people think for just a
minute. 
<P>
<H4>Rev. Finlator:</H4>
<P>
     Angie felt that the official prayer at her high school graduation
violated her right to religious liberty, because it was the government
telling her when and how to pray.  The right to be free from such
government interference is guaranteed to Angie and to all Americans by the
First Amendment to our Constitution, the bedrock of law and justice in our
country. 
<P>
     In fact this notion of religious liberty was so important to the
founders of our nation that they combined it with two of our other most
cherished rights - the guarantees of free speech and free press.  In
carefully chosen language, our nation's founders said that the government
could best guarantee religious liberty in America by leaving religion
entirely alone. 
<P>
     The Constitution clearly lays out the founder's intentions to keep
government separate from religion in the Free Exercise and Establishment
Clauses which say "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Professor Laycock
explains why our founders included this right in our Constitution. 
<P>
<H4>Professor Laycock:</H4>
<P>
     Well in the 1780's you had established churches in most of the
states. The congregationalists who were sort of descended from the
Puritans, were the established church in most of New England. The
Anglicans were the established church all through the southern counties
from Maryland to Georgia. But maybe less than half the population were
Anglicans in the South and there were lots of minority denominations in
New England, mostly Presbyterians and Baptists who were both Evangelical
denominations in those days and alot of smaller groups, Quakers and
Methodists and others. 
<P>
     And the real support for religious liberty came from these
evangelical denominations. They wanted free exercise of religion. They
also wanted an establishment clause. They wanted the government separated
from the Anglicans, separated from the Congregationalists. Their view was
if government supported religion, it would support one particular religion
and it would turn out to be bad for all the minority denominations. 
<P>
<H4>Rev. Finlator:</H4>
<P>
     I'd like to introduce you now to Allen and Becky Berger and their
children, Joshua and Moriah. The Bergers had to make some hard decisions
when they learned that Bibles were being distributed at their children's
elementary school. Because of their religious beliefs -- Becky is an elder
in her Presbyterian church, Allen is Jewish -- the Bergers felt very
strongly about handling their children's religious instruction themselves.
Yet their simple request to the school board to stop the distribution of
bibles landed them in court, in the middle of a lawsuit against the school
board of Rennsalaer, Indiana. 
<P>
<center>
<H4>                     -- Indiana Segment -- </H4>
</center>
<P>
Allan Berger: Rennselear is a fairly conservative community. Its a rural
community, its a fairly homogenous community. Its a church-going
community. 
<P>
Becky Berger: Would you please rise and join me in the call to worship. 
We confess Oh God there is that desire within us to fit in rather than be
set apart.  You call us to march to a different drummer and in responding
we find ourselves out of step with many of those around us. Forgive the
sinfulness of our choices of expedience, our rationalizations and excuses,
our turning from the abundant life you offer and from the peace and joy
that only relationship with you can give. 

<P>
Allan: It didn't really start as any kind of crusade it started simply as
a letter of complaint to the school corporation when I found out from an
alumna of mine, who had been a student of mine at St. Joseph's College
that bibles were being distributed by the Gideons each year to the 5th
grade students in the classrooms in the schools. 
<P>
Becky: In some ways it seemed like a very small issue to a lot of people 
but I think that the ramifications are more far-reaching.
<P>
Allan: Here was a situation where the school superintendent was deciding
which religions were appropriate for the students to be exposed to, which
religions were inappropriate.  We are a multi-faith family. I am Jewish,
Becky is Protestant. We feel the religious formation of our children is a
personal family matter. 
<P>
Becky: There's no question in my mind that other kinds of religious
materials would not have been acceptable for distribution in the schools. 
Having been a teacher in the school system I knew that there was no open
forum such as the school board was trying to portray that we had. 
<P>
Allan: I think one of the things that was most interesting was that Becky
received thanks from parents who are religious minorities themselves. 
Parents of 7th Day Adventists children, parents of Jehovah's Witness
children -- not that there are many families of those religious
persuasions in Rennselear. 
<P>
Allan: I never expected this issue to end up in court. I was naive. I
thought a simple letter of complaint to the school corporation would
settle the issue. Once the issue hit the press there was tremendous
polarization in town. There was little dialogue after that.  And that's
tragic because these issues ought to be settled without lawsuits. There's
no reason this ever had to become a lawsuit. 
<P>
Allan: I think for us the broader ramifications for the case mainly have
to do with a renewed faith, a renewed faith number 1 that the system
works. A renewed faith secondly in our neighbors and in our friends. We
did not lose friends our neighbors did not turn on us. We did not have
crosses burned on our lawn.  We received nasty hate mail over the 3 1/2
years but very little of it came locally. And to me, that says something
about the value and the goodness that exists in many small towns in
America like Rennselear. 
<P>
<H3>Reverend Finlator:</H3>
<P>
     Ultimately, the courts upheld the Berger's position and Becky and
Allan were satisfied that they and all the parents in their community
could decide for themselves what religious instruction was appropriate for
their own children. But sometimes, the effects of violations of the
Establishment Clause are long lasting - causing unnecessary pain and
suffering for those people whose religious rights have been violated. This
has been true since the founding of our nation. Professor Laycock
explains. 
<P>
<H3>Professor Laycock: </H3>
<P>
     In the 19th century we had an enormous political fight all across the
country over Protestant and Catholic forms of prayer. We had Catholic
children who were whipped and beaten for refusing to read the King James
version of the Bible. 
<P>
     The controversy over the Protestant Bible became so heated that there
were 40 people killed in mob violence in Philadelphia.  This was a very
major issue off and on for 30 years in the mid 19th century and it was
really only resolved when the Catholics pulled the kids out of schools and
started their own schools. 
<P>
<H3>Rev. Finlator:</H3>
<P>
     Just like Allan and Becky Berger, several families in Little Axe,
Oklahoma, the McCords and the Bells, felt that religious practices in
their public school should stop. They, like the Bergers, are religious
families. And they, like the Bergers, tried to talk to the teachers, the
school, and finally the school board. But the matter could not be
resolved.  And so, just like in Rennsalaer, the McCords and the Bells went
to court. They too won their lawsuit. But this victory came at a high
personal cost. The McCords were driven out of their home, which was then
vandalized. And the Bells - the Bells were literally burned out of their
community. Here is their story. 
<P>
<center>
<H4>                      --Oklahoma Segment--</H4>
</center>
<P>
Joann Bell: I first learned about it because my son who was a freshman was
denied entry into the school building to work on his class project -- the
school newspaper. He was told he could not enter the school at that time
unless he had the purpose of attending the prayer meetings. 
<P>
Lucille McCord: To me school is to be school and religion is religion. 
And I didn't want school putting ideas into my children's heads that I
didn't want there. 
<P>
Joann: The reaction that we got when we complained was this is what
everyone wants -- we've been having things like this for years. It doesn't
matter what a few people think. This is the way we're going to do it. In
fact the school board themselves gave me the idea to call the ACLU because
I had never had any contact with the ACLU. The school board president
actually said so sue us -- bring in the ACLU. 
<P>
Lucille: My first reaction when I was told that probably the only people
that could help us was the ACLU was I almost threw my hands up and
<P>
screamed because everything I had heard about the ACLU was just totally
against my whole religious upbringing. I had -- talk about communists and
everything else -- I had been led down the path with that the ACLU really
were the bad people of the world. 
<P>
Joann: I was raised in the Nazarene church and in fact I had a 16-year
perfect attendance Sunday School Pin. And my children are very active in
the church also. My true feeling about it was -- if that sort of religion
could be practiced in Little Axe school then maybe some other religions
that I was leery of could also be brought in. 
<P>
Lucille: No one stopped to listen to anything that we were saying. It
didn't make any difference. A lot of the people that in the community that
went to the same church that I did. And knew that I went to church. 
<P>
<P>
Joann: I got my own obituary in the mail. My kids were threatened
constantly -- their lives.  I was told my kids were not going to survive. 
They said my house would be burned.  The threats to burn my home was the
one that I probably should have taken the most seriously.  I just couldn't
see in an civilized area -- I considered that these people would not ever
do that. But my home was firebombed. Unless you've ever had a fire -- the
devastation is something you cannot even begin to describe.  To lose
everything you've ever had. And with four children you really accumulate a
lot of things -- the trophies. Everything that you saved, your baby
pictures, the little things -- your marriage license. You lose everything. 
There's nothing hardly that can be saved. One of the things, the very few
things that survived the fire was the christening dress of my daughter. We
have three sons and we have a daughter that we're very proud of and this
was her christening dress and that little hat was melted.  It's one, it's
one of the things that you'd like to pass on and let them use it for their
children. This is just an example of things that were ruined and what our
family lost in the fire. Because we essentially lost everything we had. 
<P>
Lucille: Every day something happens that brings back the memories
something that happens, something the kids will say, something they do,
something that I see. It was a devastating experience. For anyone. And I
can understand why people don't want to get involved with it. 
<P>
<H4>Reverend Finlator:</H4>
<P>
     What happened to Mrs. McCord, Mrs. Bell and their families is truly
tragic. But it is a sobering reminder that bitter conflicts over religion
still arise today. Not only in Bosnia or Ireland, but also in our own
country. The reason we are so shocked to see it happen here is because,
unlike most countries, our Constitution guarantees our right to practice
our religion free from interference or harassment. 
<P>
     That's why we don't expect to see situations like the one in Little
Axe occur in our own backyards. But they do happen. And that is why we
must work hard to prevent religious divisiveness in this country. 
Religion is a highly emotional issue. And the events in Little Axe are a
vivid example of what happens when emotions get out of hand. 
<P>
     That's why I believe that the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment is so important. The Establishment Clause guarantees that the
government will not take sides -- and that each of us will be free to
practice and teach our religion according to our individual consciences. 
As a minister, I've spent most of my life preaching peace and
reconciliation with God and humanity and promoting the church. However, I
did not force my congregation to come to our services and I did not need
or want the government's help.  People came of their own free will. 
<P>
     Many people worry that the separation of church and state means that
their children cannot practice their religion at school, during the school
day. But this is not the case.  Professor Laycock explains why. 
<P>
<H4>Professor Laycock:</H4>
<P>
     Some school officials around the country have gotten the mistaken
impression not just that the school can't sponsor prayer, but that the
school can't let anybody else talk about religion on the school grounds
and that's a mistake. 
<P>
     If you really had a rule that said no student can say grace before
his meal in the cafeteria or say a silent prayer before the math test, of
course that would be unconstitutional. But, nobody, absolutely nobody has
ever proposed a rule like that. An individual student can pray whenever
he's got a free second. What the court has forbidden is for the school to
conduct the prayer service. 
<P>
     The Court has been very concerned that parents of minority faiths
ought to be able to send their children to the public schools without
having to worry that the school would proselytize those children away from
the faith of the parents. And so the Court has been quite unwilling to
allow even very short religious services or very short prayers in the
<P>
public schools. 
<P>
<H4>Reverend Finlator:</H4>
<P>
     Earlier I mentioned that much of this debate is driven by people's
well-founded concerns about a decline in moral values in our country and
in the increase in violence on our streets and in our homes. I'm concerned
too. Some people argue that removing school-sanctioned prayer from the
public schools led to these problems. 
<P>
     William Bennett, former Secretary of Education, claims that the 1962
decision, Engel v. Vitale, banning official prayer from the public
schools, is directly responsible for our national decline. According to
Mr. Bennett and others, the 1962 decision marked a rapid plunge in SAT
scores, a skyrocketing teenage pregnancy rate and other social problems.
In fact, however, these are misleading claims. 
<P>
     To discuss this aspect of the debate, let's talk with Jonathan Kozol,
a public school teacher for more than 20 years. Mr. Kozol is also an
award-winning author who now lectures and writes about the serious
problems facing our schools and our nation. We asked him if the Supreme
Court's 1963 decision was responsible for these tragic statistics. 
<P>
<H4>Jonathan Kozol:</H4>
<P>
     If you look at the numbers, SAT averages are lower today then they
were in the 1950s. Why is that? Because in the 1950s virtually no poor
children survived high school long enough to take the SATs. Now there's a
massive increase in the numbers of kids who stay in high school long
enough to even have a chance to take these tests. Of course if more and
more kids including more marginally successful kids are taking the tests,
of course the averages are going to be lower. 
<P>
<H4>Reverend Finlator:</H4>
<P>
     From his experiences in the nation's public schools and from his
hundreds of conversations with students and teachers across the country,
Mr. Kozol believes that the removal of prayer from our public schools is
not in any way responsible for our nation's decline in morality. He
points, instead to the appalling conditions of poverty that many
school-age children experience in their homes and in their schools. 
According to the United States Department of Commerce, more children live
in poverty today than at any time since the early 1960's. Mr. Kozol
believes that these statistics are much more meaningful in explaining the
increase in violence and lack of morality in our society today. 
<P>
<H4>Jonathan Kozol:</H4>
<P>
     Nine-tenths of the social problems that we see in the United States
ultimately are related to the enormous and increasing gulf in wealth and
opportunity and education between the richest and poorest people in our
society.  Partly because of mass communication today, the very poor are
more aware of the privileges of the very rich and they could possibly have
been thirty years ago. 
<P>
     So the poorest people in our nation, are not only suffering more
today than any time in my adult life because of the intensifying poverty
in the ghettos of this country, but they are also more aware of what the
privileged receive, and the clash between the infinite opportunities that
they see on television and the bitter realities of their own lives
inevitably creates every kind of bitterness, fury, self-destructive
instinct, internal rage, frustration, and often a terrible self-despisal,
self-hate. 
<P>
<H4>Reverend Finlator:</H4>
<P>
     America's public schools are without question, one of the most
important institutions in the country in building character and teaching
values to our children. And I'm sure we all agree that every child
deserves the best education this nation can provide. And while it is
obvious that there are many problems in our public schools, it is clear to
me, as a minister and a parent that they are not linked to the Supreme
Court's decision in 1962 prohibiting school-sponsored prayer. For it is
crucial that we remember that the schools -- or any government body --
cannot substitute for our churches, synagogues, mosques, homes, or any
other place of worship. 
<P>
     This is the church where I was the senior minister for 26 years. 
Pullen Memorial Baptist Church has a long history of dedication to freedom
and openness and respect for dissent. 
<P>
     We have sought and found answers to many hard questions and dilemmas
here.  I know the dilemma that many of you face on the issue of separation
of church and state is one which you will continue to think about.  This
issue will be around for a long time to come.  There are no easy answers. 
<P>
     I hope this presentation has provided you with some of the
information you need to make your own decision about this important issue. 
At the end of this video, there is an address where you can get additional
information.  Thank you for your time today.  Goodbye - and may the
blessings of Heaven be with all of us.

<h4><p>The following op-ed by ACLU Associate Director Barry
Steinhardt<br>appeared in the NY Daily News on December 1995
</h4><img src="/graphics/redline.gif"></center>
<center>
<h3>     What is the FBI up to?
</h3></center>
<p>     In a November letter to the House Judiciary Committee, FBI Director Louis Freeh
assured a nervous Congress that his agency  had no intention of expanding the number of
wiretaps it uses. Yet only two weeks before, the FBI had published a  notice in the Federal
Register , which told a much different tale. Followng up on the &quot;Digital Telephony&quot;  law it had
won in the last Congress, the FBI served notice that it intended to require  the nation's phone
companies to alter their modern digital networks -- the backbone of the coming information
superhighway --  to enable police agencies  to eavesdrop on as many as one out of every one
hundred telephone conversations in big  cities like New York..
</p>
<h3>     Which FBI statement should we believe? The facts speak for themselves.
</h3>
<p>     According to data from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, federal
law enforcement agencies like the FBI increasingly use wiretaps or other forms of electronic
surveillance. In fact, from 1984 to 1994, the number of federal law enforcement electronic
surveillance intercepts doubled. (Electronic surveillance, these days, includes wiretaps,
electronic listening devices commonly known as &quot;bugs,&quot; and interception of pager
transmissions, E-mail and cellular telephone conversations.)
</p>
<p>     And the future, if the FBI has its way, is even more grim. The Clinton Administration's
so-called counter-terrorism legislation -- which is being pushed hardest by Director Freeh --
would expand the list of  investigations in which an electronic surveillance order could be sought
and expand the authority to wiretap without a court order.
</p>
<p>     Although the FBI would have us believe that more wiretapping is needed to save the
country from terrorists and prevent another Oklahoma City, the facts tell us otherwise.
Wiretapping is almost never used to investigate bombings, arson or firearms violations. Indeed,
the last time a wiretap was requested by a law enforcement agency to investigate one of these
crimes was seven years ago in 1988.
</p>
<p>     Ironically, while the number of wiretaps has been increasing, they have become even less 
useful as a law enforcement tool. Again, according to the government's own figures, the
proportion of incriminating conversations snarred by a wiretap has been steadily dropping  over
the last two decades from 50% in the early 1970's, all the way down to 17% in 1994.
</p>
<p>     In other words, the government concedes that 83% - five out of every six -- of  the
conversations it has intercepted in recent yerars were totally innocent.
</p>
<p>     But this is not a meaningless debate about numbers. What is at stake, is our personal 
privacy in the age of electronic communications. As electronic communications beome
dominant, do we really want to give  Federal Law Enforcement agencies  -- the same agencies
which conducted the disasterous raids in Waco and Ruby Ridge -- more authority and
increasingly poweful tools to eavesdrop ? 
</p>
<p>     The Digital Telephony, with its requirement that new digital network have built in
wiretapping capacity,  was the first time in our history that an entire industry was required to
alter its technology to the government would be guaranteed success in its snooping. It  was akin
to requiring builders to put listening devices in the walls of the new homes they build , in case
the government ever wanted to listen in.
</p>
<p>     The new wiretapping proposals  are only part of a concerted effort to increase by the
Federal Government to increase its power to eavesdrop.  Federal Intelligence agencies  have also
poposed a number of schemes to prevent American industry and private citizens from protecting
the confidentiality of sensitive communications with strong encryption  -- coding--- unless the
government  is given access to the keys to crack the code and listen in. So far, those schemes,
which began with the infamous &quot;Clipper Chip&quot; for every telephone, have been rejected.
</p>
<p>     In this age when every detail of our private lives, is stored in massive computers and
transferred around the country -- even the world -- digitally,  it would be nice to think that
technological advances are actually improving our privacy rights. Congress would be wise to put
the brakes on the FBI and take a second look at the digital telephony legislation it adopted last
year.  It could start by denying the FBI the funding,,it has sought to implement the bill.

<TITLE>Substantive Plenary VII</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff>
<center><h1>Transcript of Substantive Plenary VII<br>
 Youth & Civil Liberties</center></h1>
<blockquote>
<STRONG>MS. MURRAY:</STRONG>   Thank you very much.
To set a framework for this discussion,
I wanted to begin on a personal note.  In 1963, I
    was a high school editor in a school not far from                           
    here, and I wrote what must have been an incredibly
    ponderous article about the test ban treaty, saying
    what a good idea it was to have it and perhaps we
    really should be putting our enmity with the Soviet
    Union to rest.  That had a rich reward in terms of
   a letter from the American Legion, and I will never
   forget one of its lines.  It said, "how can you sit
   at your school window and see the American flag
   waving and not feel like a traitor."  It also got
   my newspaper shredded or whatever they did in 1963
   to offending newspapers.
<p>
              Now, at that time I hadn't heard about
   the ACLU, I didn't know that much about the Bill of
   Rights.  I certainly didn't think it applied to me,
   and at that time, halfway across the United States,
   Mary Beth Tinker was, I believe, 11 years old by my
   calculations.  It was two years before she was to
   wear her black armband to school with other
   students and before she was to take a stand for her
  rights which would culminate in a Supreme Court
   decision at the end of the '60s, which really
   brought the explosion of rights into the
   schoolhouse all around the United States.  25 years
    later, in Massachusetts, and in other states, where
    the ACLU was working with schools, states like
    California, Indiana, Illinois, Connecticut, and
    many others, 25 years later, the Tinker case is
    really a household or a classroom term.
<p>

               Now, on our first, in one of our student
    conferences in May of 1982, Mary Beth Tinker was a
   speaker and I would like to bring to your attention
   what she told students at our conference.  She
   said, "You students are strong, you have more power
   than you may think.  All of you, all you have to do
   is realize it, use it."
<p>

              And the students here who you will be
   hearing about are certainly students who have
   realized and they are using it as you will hear
   shortly.  But before I ask them to speak, I do want
   to address the political climate in which we face
   ourselves and to say something about how we can
   realize that power and help students realize that
   power, when the explosion of rights has clearly
   long run its course in this country, and when so
   many young people are being forced to spend more
   time honing their survival skills than their
   academic skills in schools.
<p>
               How can we really reach young people
    with our message when youth are so mistrusted,
    indeed, feared, and even criminalized?  To the
    extent that in the liberal state of Massachusetts,
    in fact, recently passed a law which subjects kids
    to what is in effect an educational death penalty,
    which says if they bring an illegal substance, or a
    weapon, which they did not define, to school, they
   will be expelled, permanently expelled, no
   alternative education has to be provided.  In other
   words, a form of one strike, you're out.
<p>

              Now, this climate has forced us in
   Massachusetts to develop new ways of trying to do
   our work and inspire young people to realize that
   the phrase "with liberty and justice for all" can
   be more than a pious hope, and that is what Project
   Hip Hop is all about, our civil rights tour to help
   young people come face to face with a history of
   struggle made by young people like themselves.
<p>
You know that the civil rights movement
 was not just about a leader here or there, but it
 was a movement made by young people, and I think --  
 I bring that in because that is a dimension I
 believe we must be increasingly thinking of if we
are to really have hope for the future.  But I'm
sure, as you listen to the people here, you will
leave this room with a sense of that hope.  So let
me now introduce Mary Beth Tinker.

<p>

<STRONG>MS. TINKER</STRONG>:  
Thank you very much,
Nancy.  That is a person who has been a great
    inspiration to me as I work with youth, teenagers,
    children, in St. Louis, and also in the country.
<p>

               I would like to thank ACLU for inviting
   me here.  It is such an honor and it is such a
   heartening experience to be among people that are
   supportive and warm and basically like-minded.  We
   all go out in the world in such a battle we are up
   against every day, it's really great just to be
   here, and also to hear some of my great heroes
   speak on the issues of our time this last week.
   It's just really been a joy.
<p>

  I am going to talk a little about the
   armband case, the Tinker armband case and the
   Hazlewood case, and then I would like to link it up
   a little bit to students rights and children's
   rights in general, and lastly, I would just briefly
   like to add to what Nancy has talked about, the
   situation in the 1990s that we are facing right
   now, which is an absolutely dire crisis for
   children.
<p>

 I go out and talk to groups of mostly
   kids and this is really one of the first times I
   have talked to an all-adult group, but I really
    like to talk to kids because they get so excited
    and interested in the subject of student rights and
    they can relate immediately to what I am talking
    about and they always get a lot of hope from that,
    And there is a shortage of hope among our kids
   today, and I am sure you are all aware of that,
   too.
<p>

  But my son especially thinks it is a
   pretty cool case, he is 14, and he got suspended,
   and I am going to talk about suspension a little
   bit, too, and expulsion, because it is a really big
   problem in our country right now because we have
   schools that don't want kids there, they are
   telling them in messages every day, that we don't
   want you in our school.  And this particular day,
   he was one of the ones getting the message, and he
   had been throwing an eraser across the class, so he
   went into the in-school suspension, and the vice
   principal was in there minding the kids, dealing
   with them, and he said to her, kind of menacingly,
   have you ever heard of Tinker v. Des Moines?
<p>

              Well, that was a good try, we laughed
   about it later, the principal and I, she had heard
   about it but apparently he didn't realize one of
   the finer points was that you couldn't use that to
   throw erasers at the teacher's head.  The sad part
   about that is lately you can't use Tinker to do
   much of anything, and especially since some of the
   recent decisions that have come down since then,
   especially Hazlewood, and I am going to talk about
   that some, but I really think, if it wasn't for
   Hazlewood, I am not sure what difference it would
   make to the reality in a lot of schools in our
   country today because we have got kids that are
   just undergoing such hard times.
<p>
   I just was very interested to hear what
   was going on in Texas at the small committee that
   we had on schools this morning, where kids are
   being paddled, and that's happening in Missouri,
   too, they said they had 140,000 paddlings reported
   this year in Texas.  We have kids punished right
   and left that are not allowed to wear their hair
   the way they like, are not allowed to say the
   things they want in their school reports, they
   can't talk in the school newspaper, that are not
   getting through high school, that are not getting
    through seventh grade, that are being excluded from
   our public schools.  Anyway, I want to talk a
   little bit about the armband case specifically.
<p>
   My parents were religious people and my
   father was a minister, as you have heard.  They
   subscribe to a way of thinking about Christianity
   where you are supposed to put your beliefs into
   action; kind of a curious phenomenon, but they
   still tried to do it.  So they believed in things
   like brotherhood, peace, you know, the meek shall
   inherit the Earth, and that got them in about as
   much trouble as it did Jesus, maybe a little less,
   but basically, in the early '60s, when I was about
   10 or 11, my father was under so much pressure for
   his activities in the civil rights movement, and we
   would go out picketing and we would go to all of
   the black and white churches, and spread the
   message from our little integrated group from Core,
   the NAACP, and he was trying to integrate the
   neighborhood church and also the neighborhood
   swimming pool he had been involved in in Atlantic,
   Iowa.
<p>

  So anyway, he had to leave the church in
   the early '60s because he was under so much
   pressure which, of course, made me cynical about
    organized religion for some years because I was
   really disappointed by that.  So luckily, my father
   went to work for the American Friends Service
   Committee, which was taking wayward ministers on at
   that time, and he used to joke about how it really
   was just a group of kicked-out preachers, you know,
  that couldn't find work, so he was one of them.
<p>
  And so, since I had been taught to put
   my views into action, and this was a religious
   philosophy that my parents trained me with, which
   is that we are, that God is working through us, our
   actions, we are here to put into action his word,
   that we are here to put these things into action.
   So it was really not hard for me to volunteer when
   there was a call put out to students to wear black
   armbands in mourning for the dead in Vietnam, and
   that's what we planned to do.  I heard about this
   project through the Liberal Religious Youth, the
   Unitarian youth group, which I had gotten involved
   in, a real radical, subversive group, the church.
<p>
    So anyway, the principals, you know,
   decided we couldn't wear the armbands.  The rest is
   history.  It went to the Supreme Court, thanks to
   the ACLU, because we could never have afforded or
   been able to do it without them.  And we also
   probably couldn't have done it without the support
   of people like yourselves who were there when our
   lives were threatened, when someone called me on
    the telephone, and said, you are going to be dead
    by morning, on Christmas Eve, your house is going
    to be firebombed, the red paint which was thrown at
    our house, which was so ridiculous because my
    parents were far from Communist, they were
    religious zealots, so I guess, under those terms,
   Jesus would be a Communist as well.
<p>
   So anyway, that brings us up to the
   Hazlewood case, where we lost, we had a major loss
   in students' rights, and as you will probably hear
   more, in St. Louis, Missouri, the students wanted
   to write about the controversial issue of pregnancy
   and divorce in the newspaper, and God forbid kids
   should have anything to say about that.  Anyway,
   the students lost in the Supreme Court, and the
   court declared the school has an interest in
   publications and school activities and can have
   some say about what goes in those.
<p>
   To talk a little bit about children's
   rights, I think students' rights are really in that
   context.  There is a very good book out right now
   that is called Lives On The Edge, that talks about
   single mothers.  The lives of children and mothers
   have always been connected and it wasn't until
    1874, for example, that children received legal
    recognition for abuse, and that was only because
    the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
    to Animals decided that children should be
    included, that there were laws on the books against
    abusing animals, so you really should include
    children.
<p>
 So this goes on throughout history.  The
   whole thing right now that's going on against --
   the juvenile justice right now, scapegoating
   teenagers, and especially black teenagers, is
   really nothing new.  In 1826, in Britain, a
   magistrate said there was so much juvenile crime
   that we really should ship the kids off and
   emigration would be a good solution, and, in fact,
   they did, they sent kids off and they would go
   to -- Australia was a favorite place to send kids,
   there were 502,000 kids sent off a year for quite a
   while.  It is really nothing new.  In colonial
   America, the same situation, the evangelicals said
   you should beat the will out of children, that was
   a way of keeping them from being strong-minded, and
   the slaves, I think we all know what happened
    there.
<p>
 I don't know if you realize that white
   children were sold in those years as well.  Here is
   an ad from 1760, "To be sold by Thomas Overend at
    the drawbridge, two white boys and a Negro lad, all
    about 14 years old.  Also very good lime juice."
<p>
  So, you know, this is what we are
    dealing with now today.  We come up to 1990 -- and
    I just want to take a few minutes to tell you about
   a situation you are all fairly familiar with, but
   as a nurse, I work with children, I work with a
   children's hospital, and also work in schools as a
   nurse and in my neighborhood as a nurse as well.
<p>
 What we are dealing with is a wave of
   violence that is unprecedented in this country.
   Teenagers are being killed, little children are
   being killed.  One of the leading causes of death
   right now of children under five is death at the
   hands of their parents.  The abuse and sexual abuse
   is just incredible.  The AIDS problem.  As you
   heard Joycelyn Elders, one of my heroes, say, AIDS
   is growing fastest among the teen population.
<p>
  Suicide.  It has increased something
   like 300 percent among teens in the last 30 years,
   a lot of that has to do with gay teenagers, and I
    am waiting for the Baptist, the Southern Baptist
   church to give us an apology for the way they have
    treated homosexuals.  Since they apologized for
    slavery, I think it is time they apologized for
    that.
<p>

 The sexual issues we deal with with
    teenagers are out of control, the birth rate, the
    pregnancy rate.  And also when we deal with
    teenagers, as I was saying about the suicide rate
   in gay teenagers, it is a very bad problem.
   Teenagers are not all heterosexual.  I myself was a
   gay teenager, and I know the pain that you go
   through and this is often ignored by our schools
   and they don't want to talk about it.  There is a
   very interesting case right now that the ACLU is
   pursuing in Kansas City on this issue.
<p>

              I just wanted to wind it up by
   encouraging everyone in the ACLU to join with
   others that are advocating for children, and to
   think of student rights in connection with
   children's rights and teenagers' rights, and join
   especially with child advocacy groups as we go out
   and try to improve the lot of America's youth.
   Thank you.

<STRONG>MS. MURRAY:</STRONG> Next we have Jeffrey Pyle.
<p>

<H2>MR. PYLE</H2><P>
  Hi.  I would like to tell you
    a little bit about my case, and then also speak a
    little bit on the problems with my generation and
    their apparent lack of interest in civil
    liberties.
<p>

               My story begins in 1992 when my mom
    bought me a Christmas present.  It was a T-shirt
    which said "Coed Naked Band, Do it to the rhythm."
<p>

              I was the drum major of the band at the
  time, so my mom thought it was pretty funny, I
   don't know.  So that following March I wore the
   T-shirt to gym class and my teacher pulled me aside
   halfway through the class and told me that the
   shirt was demeaning to women and would create an
   emotionally unhealthy environment in her class if I
   continued to wear it.
<p>

              I politely informed her it was my First
   Amendment right to wear the shirt, no matter who it
   offended, and you cannot censor something simply
   because you don't like it, especially in a school.
   She disagreed.  She said, "I don't get paid enough
   to listen to this crap."  So I realized that I
   couldn't get anywhere with her.  So I took it to
   the school committee because I wore the T-shirt
    back to her class again after she walked away from
    me, and was charged with insubordination, as if I
    was her subordinate.
<p>

               So I took it to the school committee and
    asked them, and told them that at South Hadley, we
    need a Constitutional speech code that allows for
    unpopular expression, and doesn't allow teachers to
    make up their own regulations on the spot as to
    what is allowed.  They disagreed with me also.  And
   they passed what is now the most restrictive dress
   code in the State of Massachusetts.
<p>

              We did a survey of a lot of them.  The
   dress code prohibits anything which they deem to be
   obscene, lewd, profane or vulgar, and which has the
   effect of demeaning someone on the basis of race,
   sex, color, national origin, and sexual
   orientation, religion, et cetera.  And it
   prohibited anything which advertised alcohol, or
   illegal drugs.
<p>

              After three months of arguing before the
   school committee, after talking with them about the
   unconstitutionality of the dress code, and bringing
   in a lawyer from the ACLU who also spoke to them,
   we realized we couldn't get anywhere with them
  either, and we filed suit in the Federal District
      Court, the case is called the Pyle v. South Hadley
    School Committee.  Something interesting about the
    dress code, something that was spoken about a
    couple of nights ago, is the alliance of the
    organized left, as Lee Strasberg calls them, and
    the religious conservative right to ban all forms
    of sexual speech, kind of the new Victorianism, as
    it is called in the book, and -- but there is very
    little difference between the new Victorianism and
   the old Victorianism in that this kind of sexual
   repression will eventually end up hurting women
   more than than it does men, so this case is not
   just about First Amendment rights but it is also
   about gender equality and the right to openly
   express sexual ideas.
<p>

              So we went to court and at the district
   level, we persuaded the judge to overturn the
   second clause of the dress code about hate speech,
   that is the second time that's been done, I think a
   very important precedent.  However, the judge also
   upheld the vulgarity clause, and in a really
   radical decision, I think, said the school
   committee, as elected officials, reflect the moral
   fiber of the community and can decide what is and
   is not vulgar for other people's children.
<p>

   This is a really radical decision, and I
   think -- and my brother and I demonstrated, in our
    protest, that it is not something that can be done
    consistently.  We wore a whole series of test
    shirts to test out the ban.  My brother wore one
    which said "Coed Naked Gerbils."  Some people will
    censor anything.  He had to carry around a pass
    every time he wore that shirt.
<p>

               I wore a shirt with a picture of two men
   on it kissing in military uniform that said, "Read
   my lips."  And that was allowed.  That was
   allowed.  However, my brother wore one with "See
   Dick Drink, See Dick Drive, See Dick Die, Don't be
   a Dick."  And that was banned.  But my favorite was
   one that I wore.  It read "Coed Naked Civil
   Liberties, Do it to the Amendments."  And not
   surprisingly, I was thrown out school for wearing
   that one, and when the principal threw me out of
   school for wearing that one, he reminded me that
   the Roman Empire fell from within, not from
   without.  Presumably, they were all wearing
   T-shirts.  The ACLU probably had something to do
   with it.
<p>

  Anyway, despite the egregious violations
   of student First Amendment rights that went on in
     this case, very few students, in fact, no students,
    came out in support of what my brother and I were
    doing.  There were no letters to the editor, very
    few showed up at school committee meetings, and
    that was pretty disappointing.  And it was
    especially distressing that none of my friends
    would come to my aid when I was personally attacked
    in the newspaper.  I was called a white male
    elitist who wanted to see 12- and 13-year-old girls
   go naked.  That was kind of strange.
<p>

              But I think it was even more distressing
   that so few students cared enough about their
   fundamental freedoms to join the fight, and I asked
   myself, as I was writing this speech, why is this,
   why don't students get involved in the numbers they
   should?
<p>

             Ira Glasser pointed out in the film we
   saw the other night that kids are born with the
  innate instincts to know what is fair, what their
   rights are, but by the time they get to high
   school, they have been denied those rights so often
   and been patronized so often when they try to
   assert those rights, that they end up forgetting
   what those rights are, and thinking, if they know
   what the rights are, thinking that the Bill of
   Rights doesn't apply to them.  We are just kids,
    right?
<p>

               So that's why I think the education
    programs that the ACLU had and that Nancy and
    Warren do and Loren do are incredibly important.
    Their efforts are too often lost in the rhetoric of
    civil liberties.  They have touched a lot of kids
    and I think they really deserve our thanks.
<p>

               But clearly, the ACLU cannot teach every
   high school kid, everybody in the nation, what
   their rights are.  I mean, we are just not big
   enough.  That is why the Constitution also has to
   be taught in the schools.  There has to be less
   preaching about responsibilities and duties, and
   more teaching about the rights that make those
   responsibilities worthwhile.
<p>

   And I also think that it's more often
   the teachers who need to be taught.  Teachers -- we
   can't blame them too much.  They are understandably
   jealous and even paranoid about the powers and
   prerogatives, because obviously, the school systems
   in this country are in a terrible mess, but
   teachers should also understand that civil
   liberties and civil rights are not inconsistent
   with an orderly school.  That's simply not the
     case.  But I think for teachers and students,
    simply knowing one's rights is not enough.  I think
    groups like the ACLU need to show kids that you can
    fight City Hall and win, as Mary Beth did.  I think
    many people in my generation suffer from a social
    disease which I call IDS, idealism deficiency
    syndrome.  This disease is brought about my
    America's proclivity for hypocrisy and is summed up
    by a popular rock song which goes, when I fight
   authority, authority always wins.
<p>

  Kids at an early age, to continue with
   the metaphor, need booster shots, and examples of
   courage.  I think Project Hip Hop, which Miriama is
   going to speak about in a minute, is a good example
   of that.  It shows kids what kids in the past
   generation did to further the rights of everybody
   else.
<p>
 And the story of Mary Beth Tinker, I
   think, also needs to be taught.  This image of the
   13-year-old girl fighting the agents of
   totalitarianism at the Supreme Court, is something
   which should shame most Americans and certainly had
   me going, to shame Americans to really reconsider
   their apathy.  I think once we cure IDS and get
   more kids involved and teach, and try to have
    children educated not to abridge rights, we will
    have a lot better future for America.
<p>

   Thanks a lot.

    is what makes my job so incredibly worthwhile.
<p>

               I would like to invite Preet Sabharwal
    to talk about what he is doing in California.
<p>

<STRONG>MR. SABHARWAL:</STRONG>
To all of you out there
    that have ever consumed alcohol, cut your hair or
   gone one day without praying, I cannot look you in
   the eye with respect anymore.  You cut your hair, a
   gift from God, and what is your justification for
   consuming alcohol, a controlled substance, and for
   any of you to not pray and thank God every day, I
   have absolutely no respect for you.  If any of you
   have excuses or justifications for any of your
   actions, you should.  You should.  But I have made
   arrangements with the hotel to have you removed
   because you do not conform to my religious tenets.
<p>

              If any of you feel disrespected, if any
   of you feel offended or appalled, you should.  You
   should, because I have just told 500 ACLU members
   to leave because many of you do not embrace the
   tenets of my religion, but as guardians of the Bill
   of Rights who understand their civil liberties and
   know that they can make choices for themselves, I
    know that not one of you will leave this ballroom
    nor one of you will leave this hotel.
<p>

               I speak with experience when I say you
    wouldn't accept such an injustice, such a
    superfluous order, because you are defenders of
    civil liberties, for 75 years, and during that time
    a number of battles have been fought for student
    civil liberties, for the civil liberties of young
   people.  From Brown v. Board of Education, to
   Tinker v. Des Moines, and now Cheemu v. Thompson,
   in California.
<p>

              In the latter case, the ACLU is
   valiantly fighting to allow a Sikh student to carry
   a kirpan to school.  The ceremonial knife is a
   small, blunt, tightly sheathed ceremonial knife
   which ranges in size.  However, when one student
   playing basketball with a Sikh student carrying
   such a ceremonial knife, meaning that the Sikhs
   have been oppressed, and the reason they carry this
   is because of the fact they want to keep at hand
   what went on in the past, much like the cross
   depicting crucifixion.
<p>

              However, when another student saw one of
   the Cheemu children wearing a kirpan at a
     basketball game in elementary school, the dull
    ceremonial dagger was labeled as a weapon and
    students were suspended until they abandoned the
    symbol.
<p>

               However, as orthodox Sikhs are required
    to carry the symbol at all times, the parents of
    the three Cheemu children decided to put their
    children out of school.  They also contacted the
    ACLU of Northern California, which filed suit in
   the U.S. District Court in April.
<p>

              The students were suspended in January.
   But the judge ruled in favor of the school district
   and the children were suspended for the duration of
   the spring semester, deprived of a semester of
   education.
<p>

              However, the relentless ACLU lawyers
   went back to court in August where the Ninth
   Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the children
   should be let back into school immediately because
   of the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act
   because the kirpan is a religious symbol
   permittable in schools which does not constitute an
   immediate danger.  The ACLU lawyers successfully
   contended that the tightly sheathed kirpan is no
   more dangerous than baseball bats, compasses or
     scissors, all commonly found in the schools every
    day.
<p>

               In addition, the ACLU found that the
    kirpan is a dull ceremonial religious symbol and
    not a knife and therefore is permitable in
    schools.
<p>

               However, following the injunction and
    numerous other arguments by the ACLU, the school
    district still appealed the injunction, and after
   this attempt to bar the children from attending
   school again, the district appealed -- the district
   was denied.  They appealed the denial again.  The
   case is now pending a constitutional trial.
   Nonetheless, the three Cheemu children, ages 7, 8
   and 10, are back in school from last September,
   finished school this June, thanks to the ACLU.
<p>

             <STRONG> (Applause.)</STRONG>
<p>

              MR. SABHARWAL:  And although this case
   was the first of its kind because of the kirpan,
   with half a million Sikhs, currently in American
   has never been documented as a violent weapon, the
   ACLU won a battle for all of them.  The case
   reinforces the fact that if a district succeeds in
   denying students their religious liberties, then
   other school districts in other states and around
     that area will do the same.
<p>

               The ACLU once again has upheld civil
    liberties for youth, and as a card-carrying member
    for two years, I am proud to be affiliated with an
    organization that fights for the civil liberties of
    all citizens.  The American Civil Liberties Union.
    No barriers, not Sikhs, not Muslims, not Blacks,
    not Whites, not Mexicans.  The American Civil
    Liberties Union.
<p>

              Moreover, this helps more than just
   Sikhs.  I work with the Howard Friedman First
   Amendment Education Project from the Northern
   California ACLU affiliate.  When we hold
   conferences for high school students, they are
   taught of these cases, Tinker v. Des Moines, about
   censorship rights, about rights they have with
   their student newspapers, about their freedom of
   the press, freedom of expression, and these
   students not only learn from these cases that we
   students study, they know when their civil
   liberties are in jeopardy.  They know when their
   rights have been violated and they know where to go
   and what to do because of the ACLU.
<p>
   These students who come to our
   conferences are potential future members of this
     illustrious organization.  They are the future of a
    successful ACLU of tomorrow.
<p>

               At conferences sponsored by the Friedman
    project, I can attest to students are fighting for
    their civil liberties.  Not only do they want to
    learn about them, they want to exercise them.
    These students, if educated nationwide about their
    civil liberties, will realize that when someone
    denies them attendance due to their religious
   belief or any other civil liberties guaranteed in
   the Bill of Rights, they will be educated to
   recognize to not leave the ballroom.
<p>

              Thank you.
<p>

 <STRONG>MS. MURRAY: </STRONG>  Thank you, Preet.  Now we
   have Miriama White-Hammond.
<p>

<STRONG>MS. WHITE-HAMMOND</STRONG>:
 First, I just want
   everyone to stretch for a couple of seconds,
   because it seems like everyone is getting tired in
   their seats, so I will give everyone just a moment
   to stretch.
<p>

              I will just say, my name is Miriama
   White-Hammond, and I work with the Hip Hop
   Project.  And I am here today to talk to you about
   youth issues, not only because I feel they are
   being threatened, but because I think they are
    central to any working democracy, for any country
    that wants to move ahead.
<p>

               It seems today there seems to be so much
    cynicism about young people.  They are not
    motivated, they don't do anything, all they do is
    watch television.  We can't get them to work, they
    have no work ethic, and I think what has started to
    happen is we see divides being set up, where the
    adults look at the young people and say, goodness,
   what's going on with them, and the young people
   look back saying, they just can't understand us.
   It's a scary situation.
<p>

              I find so many young people who know
   that there is a problem, who see what's going on
   around them and it scares them but they don't seem
   to know what to do.  It's very easy to get
   discouraged in a country where nobody seems to
   listen to you, or a time when it seems like people
   are unconcerned about what's going on with you.
<p>

              I have been to many high schools where
   people say to me, we have problems here, the gay
   and lesbian students are being discriminated
   against, the disabled students are being
   discriminated against.  There are many racial
   problems here, but what can we do?
<p>

             Through the Hip Hop Project, we have
   taken the civil rights movement and not only
   studied it as an important time in history but
   looked at it as a model for how young people can
    make change.  Anytime through history, when you
    look back at the great movements that have brought
    about more democracy and more rights, it has been
    young people who are at the forefront, moving
    things.  When you look at Tienamen Square, when you
   look at the March on Washington, other historical
   events, you will see young people who are shining
   and are standing up for what they believe in.
<p>

              Last summer we traveled into the South,
   many of us naive, just thinking that all we would
   encounter was a little hot weather and a couple of
   old people that we were going to speak to.  We
   didn't think our lives would be changed.  Some of
   us thought it was just a summer vacation.  But it
   became so much more than that.
<p>

              We went into Mississippi, which was in
   1960 labeled as the most backward state.  We saw
   places where people had died, shed blood.  We
   walked along the road where the Freedom Selma
   workers were abducted.  For many of us, it was a
   wake-up call, a realization that people shed blood
   so that we could exercise the rights which many of
    us were being denied.
<p>

               We learned about hundreds of young
    people, we learned about Claudette Colvin.  It's
    interesting to find out how many people didn't know
    about her.  Rosa Parks was a special woman and I
    don't want to deny her the recognition she
    deserves, but she was not the first to sit on the
    bus.  It was Claudette Colvin, a sophomore in high
   school, who refused to give up her seat.  The
   police were called.  It was only when Rosa came and
   bailed her out that the idea of no longer sitting
   in the back of the bus was conceived.
<p>

              Because these hundreds and thousands of
   young people have been denied the right to be in
   history books, so many of our people do not know
   where to look when they need a model.  Not enough
   people know about a Mary Beth Tinker and what she
   did.  Not enough young people now about a Claudette
   Colvin and how she acted.  Not many people know
   about the Goodman and Chaney and Schwerner boys who
   gave their lives.  They have been denied the access
   to this information.
<p>

              But instead of just complaining about
   this problem, Project Hip Hop has sought to change
  it.  We have educated ourselves and now we are
    taking that education back into the schools.  We
    realize that the curriculum has denied them this
    information, and we are committed to making sure
    that it gets to the people who need to know about
    it the most.  We have debunked many of the myths
    saying all the civil rights movement was a bunch of
    people getting together with a couple of great
    leaders.  You can organize, create a forum for the
   issues that are important to you.
<p>

              Recently, in May, I went to speak at
   Lexington, Kentucky, high school.  At the beginning
   of December, there was a party held at which many
   people got drunk and then one person proceeded to
   shout racial slurs.
<p>

              What erupted was a racial battle that
   shocked not only the people involved, but the
   entire school and the community.  But through the
   example of the students at Lexington, and the
   administration, we saw people who did not sweep it
  under the carpet but, rather, acted.
<p>

              I went there and I saw thousands of
   students who were actually concerned about what had
   happened at that school.  Many students who had
   decided not to skip on a half a day, but rather to
come in and talk about the issues that were
    important to them.  People stood up and said, as
    one student said, we have many skinheads in our
    school and we don't know what to do about it.  We
    don't know how to fight against many of the
    messages that are being put on to us every single
    day.
<p>

               And I challenged them that as long as
    there is something wrong in your community, and all
   you do is look at it, then you are partly
   responsible for what is going on.  If you have a
   problem with what's being said and the messages
   that are being given out, then you can stand up and
   say, I don't accept that, that I don't believe in
   that.  So many students don't even know what they
   can do to change the problems they see around
   them.
<p>

              It seems as though now, unlike what we
   saw in the civil rights movement, we are fighting
   against an invisible enemy.  Many people don't know
   who are making the decisions that affect their
   lives, but we hope that through the Hip Hop Project
   and other projects like them, that people will
   begin to look at where the problems are coming from
   and what they can do to effectively change them.
<p>

              We hope that we can inspire thousands of
    students, maybe not everyone will be able to go on
    Hip Hop, but that students will act like Jeffrey
    did, to try to challenge the kinds of things that
    their school board may be trying to make them do,
    that they will challenge many of the codes that are
    put against them, that they will challenge curfews
    and criminalization that is being put against
    them.
<p>

              I think one of the most interesting
   examples I can think of is that in the community I
   live in, which is a predominantly black community,
   often stereotyped as a ghetto, and I remember
   riding the bus one day and looking at the
   construction that was going on, and in Dudley
   Square, which is the center of the community, where
   the bus station is, there is the library here, the
   police department here.  You would think they were
   almost conflicting interests.  But as I looked over
   and I looked at the construction, I said, wow, they
   are rebuilding the library.  Then I looked over
   again and realized they were rebuilding the court.
<p>

              It is going to take thousands of us to
   protest these kinds of things, where all of the
   money is being spent on controlling the bad youth
  or making sure that they don't run rampant in the
    city, rather than investing in the education in the
    lives of young people who are working to do
    something different, to be something stronger than
    what is seen on television.
<p>

               I hope that you will stand with us as we
    try to encourage and support young people who are
    trying to do something different and who are trying
    to challenge a system which is supposed to be for
   them but is so often against them.  Thank you.
<p>

             <STRONG> MS. MURRAY</STRONG>:   Thank you very much.
   Miriama.  Miriama will be going on Project Hip Hop
   again this summer as a leader, and I am very much
   looking forward to her support as I drive the van.
<p>

            Now let me turn to Loren Siegel, and I
   hope maybe we will then have time at least for one
   or two questions.
<p>

<STRONG>MS. SIEGEL:</STRONG> I will try to be brief.
   Jeff, Miriama and Preet are very hard acts to
   follow, but I am honored, but I am very much
   honored to be the person who summarize what has
   been said today.
<p>

              When I was preparing for this talk and
   looking through, you know, clippings, notes,
   reports of various kinds, a question kept popping
   up in my mind and that question was, why is it that
    in American society, many people like to deal with
    young people prophylactically except where sex is
    concerned.  Let's not give them truthful AIDS
    education or distribute condoms in our schools to
    prevent AIDS and unwanted pregnancies, because it
    might encourage them to do naughty things, which,
    of course, is a false premise to begin with, but
    let's do adopt stricter and stricter rules and pass
   more and more repressive laws designed to deter
   kids from maybe doing something in the future we
   are not going to like.
<p>

              To me, the Acton case that is pending
   before the Supreme Court and will be pending only
   for another day or two, is a great point.  That is
   the student drug testing case many you have heard
   about already at the biennial, that was handled by
   the Oregon affiliate.
<p>

              To me, the really interesting thing
   about this case, when I was reading through all of
   the court papers was that this is a situation in
   which a highly invasive mandatory urine test --
   invasive in the sense that it was actually
   witnessed specimen collection -- was imposed on
   12-, 13-, and 14-year-old students who wanted to
   participate in sports, even though there was
   absolutely no evidence of a drug problem in the
    school.  The principal, it turns out, was concerned
    about a decline in student deportment.  He
    testified the students were less well-mannered than
    in the past, refused to pay attention in class,
    said rude, obscene and disrespective things, and
    laughed out loud at serious moments.  Terrible,
    just terrible.  And there was a corresponding
   increase in kids given disciplinary referrals.
   From all of this the principal drew the obvious
   conclusion that the students had a drug problem
   that warranted mandatory testing.
<p>

              Another thing that had been going on is
   Drug Alert, a product being very aggressively
   marketed to parents who think their kids might be
   doing drugs.  As you have probably heard, the kit
   consists of a chemically treated cloth and parents
   are instructed to enter their children's rooms when
   they are not there, rub the cloth on the clothing
   and furniture and send the swipe in for a chemical
   analysis to discover what drugs their kids may have
   been exposed to.
<p>

              The trouble, of course, is that this
   test cannot and does not distinguish between active
   and passive exposure.  A child passing a group of
    adults smoking marijuana on a street corner, which
    is a fairly common experience in Times Square,
    where I work every day, shows up just as positive
    as a child who, God forbid, smoked a joint with his
    friends after school.
<p>

               This is what I say when reporters call
    to ask me about Drug Alert.  There is always the
    follow-up question, invariably the follow-up
   question, and I think they are probably
   paraphrasing the entrepreneurs and proponents of
   Drug Alert, and that question is: But isn't it
   worth doing if we can prevent one kid from using a
   bad drug?
<p>

              Then there was the law that was passed
   not too long ago in the town of Harvard, Illinois,
  described in The New York Times as a small farm
   town 60 miles from Chicago, that made it illegal,
   "for any person in the city to knowingly use,
   display or wear colors, emblems or insignia that
   suggest membership in or sympathy with gangs."  In
   this town, that included the Star of David, which
   apparently had some identification with a gang.
<p>

             I thought the most interesting thing
   about the article was that the mayor of Harvard's
 justification for taking such strong anti-gang
    action, in the total absence of a gang problem was,
   "we wanted to take a proactive approach."  At the
  time the article was written, 14 kids had already
    been charged with violating the ordinance, and one
    14-year-old girl who was interviewed in the article
    said, very wisely, "It's a control thing."
<p>

               Then there is the AP story that I read
    about cities who are trying new aggressive crime
  fighting techniques, calling them magic bullets to
   deter the terror of the '90s.  In St. Louis, Mary
   Beth's hometown, police knock on doors of certain
   residents, not the ones in the middle class
   neighborhoods, by the way, and tell parents, we
   think your child might have a gun.  Would you mind
  terribly filling out this form so we can come in
   and take a look?
<p>

              In Union Point, Georgia, in order to
   deter shoplifting youth, the authorities put
   together a list of 21 young people they assumed
   were responsible.  This list was published and
   those kids were banished from the stores in town.
   Banks, video arcades and laundromats.  Guess what,
   all of the kids were African-American.
<p>

              Lots of towns and cities, of course, opt
   for the good old-fashioned curfew.  More than a
    thousand cities and counties have a curfew now.  In
    San Diego, a vintage curfew law, from 1947, was
    brought up that bans kids from being out after 10
    o'clock at night.
<p>

               The assumption that all these kinds of
    strategies will deter bad behavior is just that, an
    assumption that is totally unproven.  Deterrence is
    a very tricky thing.  There is no evidence that
   curfews, bans on certain clothes or insignia or
   drug testing will have the desired effect of
   preventing kids from getting into trouble.
<p>

              But that's not really what it's about.
   It's about control, it's about getting votes,
   making people feel they are doing something about
   difficult and complex social and economic problems,
   and above all, it's something that doesn't cost a
   lot of money, which makes it very popular with the
   politicans.
<p>

              Another whole range of issues I think
   that come up in this area, and I will conclude in a
   moment, are the attacks that we are seeing now on
   youth culture, and of course there is nothing new
   about that.  I mean, when I was growing up, it was
   Elvis Presley who was being accused of creating
   juvenile delinquency.
<p>

               But the thing that's changed a little
    bit about this whole debate is that now the
    proponents of control are citing all kinds of
    conclusive scientific studies that purport to show
    that there is some connection between the spoken
    word or image and later bad behavior.  Of course,
    if you look at the studies, that turns out not to
    be the case.  They have proved nothing of the
   sort.
<p>

              So what's to be done about all of this?
   I think one thing that we need to do, and I am
   speaking "we" generically, the ACLU, is to have
   more faith in young people, even more than we
   already have.  I think that hearing the three young
   people who spoke today really is an inspiration to
   me in my capacity as public education director.  I
   pledge to consult with them and their peers more
   about the kinds of things we are doing, to have
   focus groups, even on an informal basis, when we
   want to put out a publication, to make sure that it
   really is addressing the concerns and speaking in
   the language that kids want to hear.
<p>

              You have really given me some ideas of
   how I want to proceed with my work, and I thank you
 very much for being such an inspiration.
<p>

           <STRONG>MS. MURRAY</STRONG>:   Unfortunately, since we
    are now a half hour late, we won't have time for
    questions, but please feel free to approach our
    panelists and please join with me one last time in
    giving them a real round of applause.
<p>

               <STRONG>(Applause.)</STRONG>
<p>
<STRONG>
(A standing ovation.)</STRONG>

<I>"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."</I><BR>
<b>The First Amendment</b>
<P>
With more than 1,500 different religious bodies, and 360,000 churches, mosques and synagogues, the U.S. is the most religiously diverse, and one of the most devout countries in the world.  Moreover, we enjoy unparalleled religious liberty, and sectarian strife is relatively rare.  Today, however,  religious extremists are attempting to impose their beliefs and practices on everyone else by enlisting the government's support and aid.  These efforts, if successful, will threaten each individual's right to worship, or not worship, as he or she pleases.
<P>
Some people mistakenly believe that separation of church and state implies hostility to religion.  But in fact, the opposite is true.  The Constitution's framers understood very well that religious liberty can flourish only if the government leaves religion alone.  The free exercise clause of the First Amendment guarantees the right to practice one's religion free of government interference.  The establishment clause requires the separation of church and state.  Combined, they ensure religious liberty.

<I>"No better instrument has been devised for arriving at truth than to give a person in jeopardy of serious loss notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.  Nor has a better way been found for generating the feeling, so important to a popular government, that justice has been done." </I><br>
<b>Justice Felix Frankfurter</b>
<P>
The American public is alarmed about crime, and with good reason.  For the past generation, state and federal crime control policies have been based on the belief that law enforcement can solve the problem: more police,  harsher sentencing laws, greater use of the death penalty.  But today, with an unprecedented number of people behind bars, we are no safer than before.  We are, however, much less free.
<P>
The rights guaranteed to criminal suspects, defendants, offenders and prisoners were not included in the Bill of Rights for the benefit of criminals.  They are fundamental political rights that protect all Americans from governmental abuse of power.  These rights are found in the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  They include the guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure, the right to reasonable bail, the right to due process of law and the right to be free from cruel and unusual treatment.  This "bundle of rights" is indispensable to a free society.

<blockquote>
<i>"History teaches that grave threats to liberty often come in times of urgency, when constitutional rights seem too extravagant to endure."</i><br>
<b>Justice Thurgood Marshall, <i>Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn.</i> (1989)</b>
<p>
Throughout this country's history, the shibboleth of "national security" has often been used as a pretext for massive violations of individual rights.  In the name of national security, President Jefferson countenanced internment camps for political dissidents; President Wilson authorized the round-up and deportation of thousands of foreign-born suspected "radicals" during the Palmer Raids; and President Franklin Roosevelt interned 120,000 Japanese Americans.  The Cold War era brought loyalty oaths, blacklisting and travel restrictions; the Vietnam War era saw the government's attempt to censor the "Pentagon Papers".  None of these measures were actually necessary to preserve national security; all of them violated civil liberties.
<p>
Today, although many of these abuses are behind us, "national security" is still invoked to justify government repression.  The most recent example is the counter-terrorism legislation introduced into Congress after the April 19,1995 bombing in Oklahoma City.  This terrible tragedy was thereby compounded by repressive -- and ineffective -- legislation

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3></CENTER>
<H4>The docket.</H4>
<P>This docket summarizes the work of the American Civil Liberties Union's
National AIDS Project and the work of the ACLU's 53 state affiliates on HIV and
AIDS issues.  The ACLU works on more HIV-related litigation and legislation than
any other legal organization.</P>
<P>The docket focuses primarily on litigation, but it also includes summaries
of some of the legislative advocacy undertaken by the state affiliates.  The
docket is organized by subject, and within each subject by state.  It was
compiled during the summer of 1996, with an effective cut-off date of
approximately September 15, 1996.</P>
<H4>The staff.</H4>
<P>The National AIDS Project, based in New York, coordinates the ACLU's
HIV-related work nationwide.  <B>Matt Coles</B> is the Director, <B>Michael
Adams</B> and
<B>Marc Elovitz</B> are Staff Counsel.  <B>H. Alexander Robinson</B> is the
Project's legislative representative in Washington, D.C.  <B>Denny Lee</B>
handles media relations.<B>  Ben Dinglasan</B> is the Development Associate,
and <B>Jerl Surratt</B> is the Project's Development Consultant.  Three ACLU
affiliates have lawyers who specialize in AIDS: <B>Roger Leishman</B> at the
ACLU of Illinois, <B>Kelli Evans</B> at the ACLU of Northern California, and
<B>Taylor Flynn</B> at the ACLU of Southern California.</P>
<H4>The supporters.</H4>
<P>The National AIDS Project is largely supported by individuals and a few
Foundations.  We are deeply grateful for the support of the Projects' major
donors, the Friends and Associates.  All the Project's significant supporters
are acknowledged at the back of this docket.  The ACLU is able to do all the
work it does because of the many lawyers who volunteer their time as cooperating
attorneys.  We have only been able to mention the names of some of the scores of
cooperating attorneys here.  We are deeply grateful to all of them for the time
they give us.</P>
<H4>	 We Need Your Help
</H4>
<P>Like all ACLU special projects, the AIDS Project is funded solely by
contributions specifically designated for it.  The ACLU accepts no government
money of any kind; it depends entirely on gifts from individuals and a small
number of foundations.  The Project's ability to work for people with HIV
depends on your willingness to support it.</P>
<H4>Why Give To the Project</H4>
<P>Because it is a part of the ACLU, the Project brings a unique voice to
advocacy for people with HIV.  The ACLU puts fighting for people with HIV in
context as part of a larger program to preserve basic rights for all Americans. 
Because of its strong national presence and its nationwide affiliate network,
the ACLU can respond to attacks on people with HIV and AIDS whenever they occur.
</P>
<H4>Ways to Help</H4>
<P>Contributions to the ACLU AIDS Project are tax-deductible, and support both
national and local work.  The Project has a FRIENDS group for those who
contribute $1,000 or more per year, and an ASSOCIATES group for those who give
$500 or more per year, but every contribution helps.  We can also provide help
with bequests, life income and other planned gifts which may have unique tax and
financial benefits.  </P>

<H4><A NAME="1"></A>1.   ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE</H4>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Illinois</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>G.S. v. Dr. Karim Baksh</B><BR> 	G.S. was a dental patient of Dr. Baksh
for more than ten years.  When G.S. told Baksh that he had tested positive for
HIV, the dentist refused to provide even routine dental services.  The ACLU of
Illinois filed a complaint with the state Human Rights Commission (HRC) alleging
that Baksh was guilty of discrimination on the basis of handicap.  The
commission ruled that Baksh was guilty of discrimination, and awarded damages
and attorneys' fees.</P>
<P>	This was the first HIV discrimination claim to be brought under the
Illinois law banning disability discrimination.  It established both that the
law applied to HIV and that dental offices are public accommodations covered by
the law.</P>
<P>	Following the AIDS-related death of G.S., the ACLU successfully moved to 
substitute the Estate of G.S. as Claimant.  Dr. Baksh then moved to dismiss the
case on the ground that all claims were extinguished upon G.S.'s death.  The HRC
denied Dr. Baksh's motion, ruling for the first time that a discrimination claim
under the Human Rights Act survives the death of the claimant.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Cut'n Dried Salon v. National Group Life Insurance</B><BR> 	The ACLU of
Illinois challenged an insurance company's refusal to provide employee health
insurance to hairdressers, graphic designers, florists, and others in
professions believed to be heavily filled by gay men.  The complaint is 
currently pending before the Illinois Human Rights Commission.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>New Jersey</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>D.B. v. Madison Dental Center</B><BR> 	The ACLU of New Jersey
represents a plaintiff who was denied treatment by a dentist after the patient
told him he was HIV-positive.  The suit alleges that the denial of treatment
violated New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination, which prohibits discrimination
in public accommodations, and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, which
prohibits dentists from refusing to treat patients because of HIV status.  On
August 29, 1994, the U.S. District Court issued a default judgment against the
dentist and his employer for failure to provide information in pretrial
procedures.</P>
<P>	After a hearing on damages, the  Court entered judgment for $25,000 in
compensatory and $25,000 in punitive damages against the dentist, who has
absconded.  The ACLU is attempting to track down his assets for seizure.  John
Jacobi of Crummy, Del Deo, Griffinger &amp; Vecchione was the cooperating
attorney.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Confidentiality in Insurance</B><BR> 	The ACLU of New Jersey submitted
detailed comments in opposition to a proposed change in the state's insurance
regulations which would have permitted insurers to ask questions about HIV
status if the questions were &quot;phrased in the same manner as questions
related to other diseases and conditions,&quot; and would have allowed insurers
to test for HIV &quot;if they require screening tests for other diseases or
conditions.&quot;</P>
<P>	The ACLU argued that the proposed legislation would permit discriminatory
treatment of HIV positive persons because it did not require that HIV be treated
similarly to all actuarially similar diseases.  The ACLU also argued that the
regulations violated the ADA.  Finally, the ACLU argued that regulations
defeated the cost-spreading purpose of insurance.  The insurance Commissioner
withdrew the proposed regulations.  John Jacobi of Seton Hall Law School was the
ACLU cooperating attorney, along with former ACLU Legal Director Marsha Wenk.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>New York</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Cahill v. Rosa</B> <BR> 	The Project filed an <I>amicus</I> brief
before the New York Court of Appeals on behalf of a coalition of national and
state organizations committed to securing the rights of people with disabilities
including HIV/AIDS.  Roy Grabowski was denied dental treatment by Dennis Cahill,
D.D.S. in August 1991 because Dr. Cahill believed that Mr. Grabowski could be
infected with HIV.  Mr. Grabowski was told that &quot;if [he] was positive, [he]
would have to find someplace else to go.&quot;  </P>
<P>	The State Human Rights Commission found that Dr. Cahill had violated the
New York State Human Rights Law.  On appeal, Dr. Cahill argues that his office
is not covered as a &quot;public accommodation&quot; under the law and that he
is therefore not subject to its non-discrimination mandate.  The Project's <I>amicus</I>
brief explained how a dentist's office is covered under the terms of the Human
Rights statute and how the history and purpose of the statute require a broad
and inclusive interpretation of its provisions.  Briefs were submitted in the
Summer of 1996, the case was argued in early September and a decision is
expected shortly.  Cooperating attorneys for the Project were Robert W.
Lehrburger and David M. Levin of Patterson, Belknap, Webb &amp; Tyler.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>South Carolina</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Givens, et al. v. South Carolina Health Insurance Pool, et al.</B>	
<BR>	This is a challenge under the Americans with Disabilities Act to the
express exclusion of people with HIV from the South Carolina Health Insurance
Pool.  The insurance pool is designed to provide health coverage to people who
are otherwise uninsurable because of pre-existing medical problems.  It is
prohibited from setting rates based on medical condition.  By definition the
pool covers expensive high-risk conditions such as heart, lung, or liver
disease, diabetes, and cancer.  But all people with HIV are absolutely excluded
from the pool.  The lower court held that the ADA allows an insurer &quot;to
exclude any risk it wishes from coverage.&quot;  Oral arguments on appeal were
heard April 1, 1996.  The appeal is being handled by the Project with the
affiliate.</P>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="2"></A> 2.   CONFIDENTIALITY</H4>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Connecticut</H5> </CENTER>
<P><B>Doe v. Marselle</B><BR> 	In a unanimous decision, the Connecticut
Supreme Court reversed a lower court's narrow reading of the state HIV
confidentiality law.  The Supreme Court held that a doctor could be liable for
knowingly (as opposed to accidentally) disclosing a patient's HIV status, even
if he had no intent to cause harm to the patient.  The decision restores the
ability to seek damages for persons whose HIV status has been unlawfully
revealed.  The Connecticut Civil Liberties Union submitted an
<I>amicus</I> brief on behalf of the American Public Health Association, the
Connecticut AIDS Action Council and thirteen other individuals and groups.  </P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Hawaii</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Jane Doe v. City and County of Honolulu</B><BR> 	The Hawaii ACLU
represents a woman who was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment in
1988, when she allegedly offered to have unprotected sex with an undercover
police officer who believed she had HIV.  The police attempted to test her for
the presence of the virus without consent and publicly claimed that they
believed she was infected.  The suit alleges violation of state law guaranteeing
confidentiality of HIV status and prohibiting HIV testing without informed
consent.  The suit also alleges violation of the right to privacy.  The case is
awaiting trial.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Idaho</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Teacher and Student HIV Disclosure</B><BR> 	The Minidoka School
District has a policy that requires all public school students and school 
employees who are HIV-positive to disclose their status to school officials. 
ACLU cooperating attorneys are advising the school district that the policy is
illegal and unconstitutional.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Maine</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Joseph T. v. Brighton Medical Center and Dr. Robert Warner</B><BR> 	The
ACLU of Maine represents Joseph T., a Massachusetts resident injured in a car
accident in Maine in December 1992.  He was taken to Brighton Medical Center for
treatment and told hospital personnel, doctors, and staff that he had HIV.  The
hospital and Dr. Warner later disclosed his HIV status to third parties
(including his health insurance company) in violation of the Maine Medical
Conditions statutes.  The district court ruled that Joseph first had to go
through a pre-litigation medical malpractice screening procedure.  On appeal,
the Superior Court ruled that the Medical Conditions Act does not require the
screening.  The case has been sent back to the district court.  The ACLU is
being assisted by cooperating attorney Hugh Calkins.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Massachusetts</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Medical Records</B><BR> 	The ACLU of Massachusetts, in coalition with
other groups, has been developing privacy legislation for medical records which
the ACLU hopes to see introduced before the end of this legislative session.</P>
<P>	Massachusetts current law requires written informed consent to test or
disclose information on AIDS/HIV.  The coalition has been able to prevent
changes.  The ACLU has opposed a bill for mandatory HIV counseling for pregnant
women.  The bill has not made progress.  The ACLU was prepared to oppose a
limited involuntary testing program that was proposed, but it made no progress.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>New Jersey</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Jane Doe v. Passaic General Hospital</B><BR> 	The ACLU of New Jersey is
representing a client who is challenging a hospital policy of including a
patient's HIV status on hospital bills that are routinely sent to employers. 
After the plaintiff was hospitalized for tonsillitis (unrelated to her HIV
status), the hospital sent a bill to the personnel department of the plaintiff's
employer, indicating that she was HIV-positive.  The hospital claims that
confidentiality laws do not prohibit the release of this medical information. 
This case was settled for an undisclosed sum and the hospital agreed to change
its forms and procedures to ensure that HIV status will not be revealed without
the patient's consent.  Betty Goldman was the ACLU's cooperating attorney.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>North Carolina</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>ACT UP v. NC Health Service Commission</B><BR> 	This case challenges an
 administrative regulation that would have eliminated anonymous testing for HIV.
 The Superior Court issued an order requiring the state health commission to
reconsider the regulation in light of evidence that it would deter people from
being tested.  The ACLU of North Carolina helped provide evidence to the
Commission showing that the elimination of anonymous testing in the past has
resulted in a decrease in overall testing for HIV, especially among gay men and
adolescents.</P>
<P>	Nevertheless, the Health Services Commission voted to enact the regulation
effective June 15, 1995, and the Superior Court upheld the decision.  The North
Carolina Court of Appeals in turn upheld that decision.  The case is now before
the North Carolina Supreme Court, where the ACLU-NC has filed an <I>amicus</I>
brief.</P>

<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>North Dakota</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Anonymous Testing</B><BR> 	The ACLU of North Dakota participated in a
statewide public policy task force charged with developing recommendations to
the state's Health Department about appropriate ways to provide education,
information and referral services to at-risk groups within the state.  At the
urging of the ACLU, the Task Force included recommendations for anonymous
testing sites and public education outreach efforts in the Native American
community.  The ACLU also worked to defeat a recommendation calling for
mandatory testing of at-risk populations and pregnant women.</P>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="3"></A>3.   CONDOM DISTRIBUTION</H4>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Massachusetts</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Marchisio v. Kouloheras</B><BR> 	The ACLU of Massachusetts represented
a group of AIDS outreach workers who were threatened and physically assaulted by
a Lowell school committee member who opposed their distribution of condoms in
downtown Lowell. The plaintiffs sued the committee member under a state civil
rights law which prevents interference with rights through threats,

intimidation, and coercion.  As trial was to begin, the member agreed to settle
the case by issuing a public apology and making a donation to an AIDS service
organization.  The ACLU was assisted by cooperating attorney Jay Kelley-Crawford
of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris &amp; Glovsky.  </P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>New York</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Kalke et al. v. City of New York</B><BR> 	The All Saints Lutheran
Parish in the Bronx wanted to distribute condoms and demonstrate their use as
part of its Second Annual Basketball Tournament.  The parish, through the South

Bronx Ecumenical ministry, trains young people to teach their peers about risk
reduction, including condom use.  The New York City Department of Parks approved
the permit for the tournament, but refused to allow the parish to make condoms
available at the event, citing an &quot;unwritten rule&quot; prohibiting condom
distribution.  The New York Civil Liberties Union sued and got an order
permitting condom distribution at the tournament.  The NYCLU is now seeking an
order setting aside the &quot;unwritten rule&quot; completely.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Alfonso v. Fernandez</B><BR> 	This suit was brought by certain parents
of New York City public school students.  They wanted to prohibit the Chancellor
of the City Board of Education from making condoms available on request to New
York City high school students.  The New York Civil Liberties Union filed a
friend of the court brief in which approximately 38 other groups and individuals
joined, supporting the Board of Education's condom distribution plan.  While the
trial court upheld the plan, the Appellate Division reversed, and ordered the
program to end.</P>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="4"></A>4.   CRIMINAL LAW</H4>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>California</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Criminalizing Transmission</B><BR> 	The ACLU affiliates in California
fought AB 380, which would have imposed 15 years to life imprisonment for
individuals who committed certain offenses, knowing that they were HIV-positive.
 This bill also would have added these offenses to the list of &quot;violent
felonies&quot; which incur sentencing enhancements; and added these offenses to
the list of &quot;serious felonies&quot; that could not be subject to plea
bargain.  This bill did not pass.</P>
<P>	The California affiliates are fighting AB 2147, which would criminalize
knowing exposure of another to HIV by engaging in unprotected sexual activity or
 needle sharing.  The term of imprisonment would depend on whether or not the 
individual intended to infect the other person.  The bill passed the assembly
and is now in the Senate Health &amp; Human Services and Criminal Procedure 
Committee.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Maryland</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>McPeak v. Cecil County</B><BR> 	More than 20 years ago, Steven McPeak
was convicted of raping the daughter of a prominent local citizen, and was given
a long sentence.  While in prison, McPeak contracted HIV and became acutely ill
with AIDS.  Toward the end of his sentence, McPeak was granted a rare medical
parole and he returned to his mother's home.  But when the victim's father, now
the mayor, learned of McPeak's release, he sent police to rearrest him on false
charges of engaging in sexual activity and infecting others with HIV.  McPeak
spent nearly a month in jail without being charged.  Finally his public defender
won his release, but only on the condition that McPeak never set foot in Cecil
County.  The ACLU of Maryland and the Legal Aid Prisoner Assistance Project
began efforts to invalidate the ban so that McPeak could go home to die.  Sadly,
however, McPeak died before these efforts could succeed.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Texas</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>In Re Weeks</B><BR> 	The Project assumed post-trial representation of a
Texas prison inmate who was sentenced to 99 years for attempted murder because
he spit on a guard.  At his trial, the court accepted as &quot;expert&quot;
testimony on HIV transmission from Lorraine Day, a bone surgeon, and Paul
Cameron, a psychologist, both of whom contradicted the generally accepted view
that HIV could not be transmitted via saliva.  The jury convicted and on appeal,
the state courts held it was not error to allow &quot;experts&quot; to testify. 
Following recent directives from the U.S. Supreme Court to give the widest
latitude to state courts in criminal cases, the U.S. District Court at the 5th
Circuit Court of Appeals refused to disturb that decision.</P>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="5"></A> 5.  EDUCATION</H4>
<P></P>

<CENTER>
<H5>California</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Permission for AIDS Education</B><BR>	AB 2472 would bar any student in
grades K-9 from receiving education on AIDS prevention, sex or family life, and
venereal disease if the school district has not received written permission from
the parent or guardian.  This bill passed assembly, and is now in the Senate
Education Committee.  The ACLU affiliates in California are fighting the bill.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Kentucky</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>AIDS Education Content</B><BR>	The ACLU of Kentucky joined the Kentucky
Fairness Alliance in its successful efforts to oppose a raft of anti-gay and
lesbian and anti-privacy legislation, including legislation which would have
required that students in public schools be taught that &quot;homosexual sodomy
is the primary mode of transmission of HIV and is against the public policy of
Kentucky.&quot;  Another bill which was defeated would have prohibited people
with HIV from obtaining a cosmetologist's license.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Massachusetts</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions, Inc.</B><BR>	A small group of
parents brought a federal lawsuit seeking millions of dollars in damages against
Chelmsford school officials, an AIDS educator and her business, a representative
of the parent-teacher organization, and a local pediatrician for their
involvement in an AIDS education assembly at the high school.  The parents
claimed that their children were required to attend the assembly which they said
contained lewd and indecent expression.  They charged that the assembly violated
their freedom of religion and their freedom as parents to raise their children
according to their own values.  The lawsuit also claimed the assembly
constituted sexual harassment.</P>
<P>	The U.S. District Court dismissed the lawsuit for failure to state any
recognized legal claims.  After the plaintiffs appealed, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the dismissal, emphasizing that exposure
to ideas that some find offensive did not violate any legal rights and that
parents could not restrict the flow of information in public school based on
individual moral or religious beliefs.  The plaintiffs petitioned the U.S.
Supreme Court to review the case.  That petition was denied in March.  In the
meantime, the plaintiffs also filed a state court action raising the same
claims.  That case is still pending and the ACLU continues to represent some of
the defendants.  Other defendants in the first case were represented by John
Foskett of Deutsch Williams, Mary Bonauto and Ben Klein of Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders, and Neila Straub.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>AIDS Education Content</B><BR> 	The ACLU of Massachusetts supports a
bill to make AIDS/HIV education mandatory.  Although the bill made some process
early in the session, it is not expected to get further this year.</P>
<P>	The ACLU of Massachusetts opposes a so-called &quot;parents' rights&quot; 

bill.  With a large coalition, the ACLU has been able to amend the bill into a
single provision requiring school districts to notify parents of any school
program that is primarily involved with human sexuality and provide them the
opportunity to opt out.  Unfortunately, the language of the bill is patently
offensive in its definition of human sexuality.  The ACLU remains opposed to the
language and is working to defeat the bill or amend it.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>New Hampshire</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>In Re WMUR-TV</B><BR> 	The ACLU of New Hampshire represents the Steve
Michaels for President Campaign Committee in a complaint against WMUR-TV.  The
station refused to air two of three commercials for AIDS activist Michaels'
campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination in the New Hampshire
primary.  One of the disputed commercials showed how to clean a syringe, and the
other showed two men kissing and carried a message about condom use.  WMUR
argues that the commercials are indecent.  The ACLU argues that the station does
not have the right under the statute governing campaign commercials to censor
content.  The case is before the FCC.</P>

<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>California</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Doe v. U.S. Attorney General (FBI)</B><BR>	The ACLU of Northern
California and the Employment Law Center represented a doctor with AIDS who sued
the FBI for discrimination under the Federal Rehabilitation Act.  Upon learning
that the doctor had AIDS, the FBI canceled its contract with him for physical
exams on agents.</P>
<P>	Following a trial in 1989, the United States District Court ruled that no
one could sue a federal agency under the Rehabilitation Act.  The doctor
appealed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding both that the United States
could be sued and that it had waived immunity from damage claims.</P>
<P>	In December 1994, the District Court again decided in favor of the FBI. 
The District Court held that Dr. Doe could not win because having AIDS was not
the &quot;sole&quot; reason why the FBI discharged him.  The Ninth Circuit
originally upheld the trial court decision.  However, after two rehearing
petitions, the Court reversed, holding that while the FBI was entitled to know
what risks a physician with HIV would present and what precautions Dr. Doe was
taking, it was not entitled to know if Dr. Doe had AIDS, because the evidence
showed a doctor with AIDS performing routine physicals poses no significant
risk. </P>
<P>	The FBI asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case for review and hold
it pending the resolution of Lane v. Pena, another ACLU case which poses the
same question posed in the first appeal in our case: had the U.S. waived
immunity from damages.  In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Lane that the
United States is not liable for damages in disability cases.  The Court then
sent our case back to the Ninth Circuit for further proceedings.  While the case
was pending before the Supreme Court, the ACLU began settlement negotiations. 
The government agreed in principle to embody the main points of the favorable
Ninth Circuit decision about health care workers with AIDS in &quot;guidance&quot;
memos it publishes interpreting the ADA.  Settlement negotiations are
continuing.  Kirke Hasson of Pillsbury, Madison &amp; Sutro is the cooperating
attorney.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Testing Boxers</B><BR>AB 2472 requires anyone applying for a license as
a professional boxer to provide evidence that he or she has tested negative for
HIV within the past six months.  The bill passed assembly and the Senate and is
now in the Appropriations Committee.  The ACLU opposes the bill.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>	
<H5>Michigan</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Sanchez v. Kostas Lagoudakis</B><BR>	The ACLU of Michigan represents a
waitress who brought suit against her former employer under the Handicappers'
Civil Rights Act (HCRA) after the employer told her that she had to get medical
evidence that she was disease-free before she could continue to work.  The trial
court dismissed the plaintiff's claim on the ground that she did not have a
handicap as defined by the HCRA.  The Supreme Court reversed on the ground that
the perception that a person has a handicap, even if wrong, was actionable under
HCRA.  The Supreme Court then remanded the case to the trial court.  The trial
awarded Sanchez lost wages and tips, costs and attorney's fees.  The defendant
appealed.  The Court of Appeals concluded that a severely compromised immune
system associated with AIDS was unrelated to an individual's ability to
satisfactorily perform the duties of waitress.  This case has been appealed to
the Michigan Supreme Court.</P>

<H5>Utah</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Allred v. Solaray</B><BR>	The ACLU of Utah filed suit on behalf of
Wallace Kim Allred, who was fired because he had AIDS.  Seven months later, Mr.
Allred died.  The ACLU is currently preparing a response to Solaray's Motion for
Summary Judgment which is based upon the premise that the action does not
survive Mr. Allred's death.  All other proceedings have been stayed.  </P>

<CENTER>
<H5>Massachusetts</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Clean Needles</B><BR>	The ACLU of Massachusetts continues to support
expansion of the clean needles pilot program beyond the existing four cities
which are currently involved.  No progress is expected this year since there is
strong opposition on the local level.  The program is limited to ten pilot
projects.</P>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="8"></A>8.   PARENTING</H4>
<CENTER>
<H5>Nebraska</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Brummett v. Nebraska and In Re JNT</B><BR>	The ACLU of Nebraska is
providing direct representation to foster parents who were denied the right to
adopt their child because Ms. Brummett is HIV-positive.  The child, J.T., lived
with the Brummetts for over 3 years under the state's &quot;fos-adopt&quot;
program.  The Department of Social Services removed J.T. from the Brummetts
when, during the course of the foster parent application, the department
discovered that Ms. Brummett was HIV-positive.  J.T. was eventually returned to
the Brummetts by the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the Brummetts are close to
becoming J.T.'s adoptive parents.  The Brummetts are now suing the state in a
federal court, under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation
Act.  Lincoln attorney Chuck Bentjen is the cooperating attorney for this
action.</P>

<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>California</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Bullock v. Gomez</B><BR>The ACLU of Southern California brought this
case against the California Department of Corrections (CDC) and California Men's
Colony under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.  It
challenges the state's blanket exclusion of all HIV-positive prisoners from the
conjugal visitor program.  The plaintiffs, a husband and wife, have been denied
visits even though both are HIV-positive, the couple is unable to bear children,
and they have agreed to use condoms.</P>
<P>	The case was successfully settled in June with the plaintiffs being granted
conjugal visits.  The visits are particularly important in this case because the
plaintiffs have not been able to visit each other for the past year, and it is
not expected that the husband will survive the length of his prison term. The
ACLU was co-counsel with the Prison Law Office and Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays
&amp; Handler.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Gates v. Deukmejian</B><BR> 	Under a consent decree, the California
Department of Corrections instituted a &quot;pilot program&quot; designed to
show that HIV-infected inmates need not be segregated from the general prison
population.   In February 1991, the Department pronounced the pilot a success
and announced its plans for housing HIV-infected inmates in the future.</P>
<P>	Although the plans were acceptable in many ways, the ACLU of North Carolina
has been mediating disagreements with the Department about the criteria used to
decide how HIV-infected inmates are housed, some programming restrictions which
are still imposed on inmates (limitations on overnight visits with spouses, no

jobs in food services), and programming in the remaining closed units
(maintained for inmates who have demonstrated a significant risk of engaging in
conduct likely to spread the virus).</P>
<P>	After an evidentiary hearing on the housing criteria, the parties settled
the issue with defendants adopting criteria somewhat more stringent than those
originally suggested by plaintiffs.  The issue of jobs in food services went to
an evidentiary hearing and the mediator ruled in favor of plaintiffs. 
Defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which reversed and permitted job
exclusion.  The Court held that although Congress did not exempt prisons from
the disability discrimination laws, discrimination laws do not apply with full
force in a prison.  The parties were able to resolve differences about
restrictions on work furlough and programming including closed units.  The
overnight spousal visits claim was dropped.  The Prison Law office, Warren
George of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &amp; Enersen, and Sally Rosen and Sam Miller
of Rosen, Bien &amp; Asaro are co-counsel.<B></B></P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Shumate v. Wilson</B><BR> 	The Central California Women's Facility in
Chowchilla and the California Institution for Women in Frontera currently house
over 5,500 women.  Many of them suffer from  chronic conditions such as HIV
infection, tuberculosis, diabetes, hypertension, and sickle cell anemia.  The
medical care available to these women, as well as to other women at the
facility, is seriously deficient.  They are often denied timely and effective
treatment, have difficulty in refilling necessary prescriptions, and are unable
to obtain needed pain medication.  Moreover, policies in place at these
institutions often result in the disclosure of confidential medical information,
such as a prisoner's HIV status.  On April 4, 1995, the ACLU of Northern

California, working with the ACLU's National Prison Project and a coalition of
other civil rights and civil liberties organizations, filed a class action
lawsuit in federal court in Sacramento to remedy this situation.  The class has
now been certified and discovery is proceeding.  The case is scheduled to go to
trial in early 1997.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Testing of Prisoners</B><BR>	AB 3288 would require mandatory HIV,
tuberculosis, and hepatitis testing of all incarcerated persons.  This bill
passed the Assembly but died in the Senate Criminal Procedure Committee.  The
ACLU opposes the bill.</P>
<P>	The ACLU opposes AB 3378, which authorizes the Department of Corrections to
use every means necessary to ascertain the existence of all AIDS cases in
prisons, and eliminates the appeal process for a prisoner who is mandated to
take an HIV test.<B></B></P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Kansas</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Prison Medical Care</B><BR> 	The Criminal Justice AIDS Network
contacted the ACLU about complaints from the Johnson County jail that inmates
with HIV were not receiving proper care.  The ACLU contacted the jail and
registered the complaint.  The Criminal Justice AIDS Network reports that the
inmates are now receiving proper care as a result of the letter.<B></B></P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Massachusetts</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Medical Parole Bill</B><BR> 	The ACLU of Massachusetts supports a bill
to permit medical parole of prisoners with less than six months to live.  This
bill has made great progress through the legislature but has had exemptions for
certain criminal histories attached.  The bill is currently being held up in the
House Ways &amp; Means Committee. </P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Missouri</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Prison Medical Care</B><BR> 	The ACLU of Missouri was contacted about
the lack of medical care and treatment of prisoners in the Kansas City jail by
the Criminal Justice AIDS Network.  The ACLU is gathering additional information
about treatment and conditions at the facility.  </P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Rhode Island</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Testing of Prisoners</B><BR> 	The ACLU of Rhode Island opposed
legislation mandating HIV testing for all prisoners, including pre-trial
detainees, and allowing correctional officers to learn the HIV status of all
inmates.  The bill passed both houses of the legislature, but was vetoed by the
Governor in July, 1995.  A similar bill is pending now.  <B></B></P>
<HR>
<H4> <A NAME="10"></A>10.   REPORTING</H4>
<CENTER>
<H5>California</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Test Reporting</B><BR>	AB 2812 would have required physicians to report
HIV test results to local and state health officials.  The California affiliates
fought the bill, which died in the Assembly.</P>
<CENTER>	
<H5>Florida</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Test Reporting</B><BR>	On May 17, 1996, Florida enacted legislation
which requires physicians and laboratories to report HIV infection to the public
health authorities.  S.B. 474 became law without Governor's signature.  The ACLU
fought the law.</P>
<CENTER>
<H5>		Georgia</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Vaccination Registry</B><BR>A bill was introduced by Rep. Billy Randall
that would have created a childhood immunization registry in order for the
Department of Health to remind parents when booster shots were due.  During the
floor debate in the House, an amendment was adopted to include an &quot;HIV
registry&quot; for children.  Ultimately, that amendment was stripped in the
Senate and the sponsor accepted some of the changes proposed by the ACLU to
protect the rights of religious minorities prior to the bill's passage.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>		Montana</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Contact Tracing</B><BR>	The Montana Civil Liberties Union successfully
worked to defeat an AIDS testing bill which would have required all those who
test positive for HIV to disclose the names of anyone with whom they have had
sexual contact.  The bill would also have permitted HIV testing without consent
if a person exposed health care providers or corrections officials to blood or
other bodily fluids.  Finally, the bill would have allowed health care providers
to end anonymous HIV testing.  The bill did not pass.  </P>
<HR>
<H4><A NAME="11"></A>11.   TESTING</H4>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Hawaii</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Roe v. Oku</B><BR>	The Hawaii ACLU represented an individual who was
tested for HIV and had his HIV status revealed without his permission while he
was a prisoner.  The ACLU argued the tests and disclosure violate state law, the
right to privacy, and the U.S. Constitution.  The case originally included the
doctor who performed the test, as well as officials of the Department of Public
Safety.  The doctor settled.  The case was set to go to trial, but the state
settled on satisfactory terms.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>	
<H5>Illinois</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Doe v. Alexian Brothers Medical Center</B><BR>	John Doe was admitted to
Alexian Brothers Medical Center for minor surgery in April 1995.  While
hospitalized, he was tested for HIV without his knowledge.  He discovered that
he had been tested for HIV when he received a copy of his insurance bill.  On
April 8, 1996, the ACLU of Illinois filed suit in federal court asserting claims
against the doctor and hospital under the federal Rehabilitation Act, the
Illinois AIDS Confidentiality Act, and Illinois common law.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>		Kansas</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Testing Criminal Defendants</B><BR>	The ACLU of Kansas was unsuccessful
in its bid to oppose new HIV testing legislation.  HB 2586 gives victims of
crime in adult as well as juvenile proceedings the ability to request HIV
testing of a person who is charged with a crime when it appears body fluids may
have been transferred.  The court is required to order HIV testing if requested
by the victim, the prosecutor, or if the person charged tells the arresting
officer he or she is HIV-positive.  The bill also allows the employer of a
corrections officer, emergency services employee, or law enforcement employee to
request HIV testing.  If the test is negative, the court may order a retest six
months later.  Test results are inadmissible in any criminal or civil
proceeding.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>	
<H5>Missouri</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Testing Criminal Defendants</B><BR>	The ACLU of Missouri opposed
numerous bills requiring HIV testing, including a bill which would have required
the testing of prostitutes, persons arrested for drug offenses, anyone an
emergency room medical technician believes might have exposed him or her to the
disease, and any defendant a judge has reason to believe might have put another
at risk.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>New Jersey</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>State in the Interest of J.G., N.S., and J.T.</B><BR>	This is a
challenge to two New Jersey laws which require HIV testing of juvenile and adult
sexual offenders upon request of the victim.  The ACLU of New Jersey argued that
the testing constitutes an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment
because it cannot provide useful knowledge to the victim.  A negative result is
not conclusive, due to the latency period for HIV, and  positive test does not
mean the virus has been transmitted.</P>
<P>	The ACLU-NJ has participated as a friend of the court at all stages of the
litigation, beginning at the trial level, where the ACLU presented extensive
expert testimony on the irrationality of the testing, and testimony from
victim's rights advocates that testing would be harmful to the victim.  The
trial judge found the law unconstitutional but was reversed by the Appellate
Division.  The New Jersey Supreme Court has granted certification, the case has
been briefed, and is awaiting oral argument.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>New Mexico</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Testing Criminal Defendants</B><BR>	The ACLU of New Mexico worked with
women's rights activists on a bill which requires HIV testing for those charged
with rape.  In coalition with HIV lobbyists, the ACLU was successful in its
attempt to alter the suggested bill so that it would have a less prejudicial
impact on the gay community.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>	South Carolina</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Confidential Testing</B><BR>	The ACLU of South Carolina successfully
lobbied for the passage of an anonymous home HIV testing bill.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>	
<H5>South Dakota</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Testing Criminal Defendants</B><BR>	This bill required those arrested
for any offense in which there may have been an exchange of body fluids to be
tested for hepatitis B and HIV.  Additionally, the bill would have given broad
discretionary powers to the police for determining who would be tested.  As a
result of the ACLU's lobbying efforts, this bill was amended to require only
that the state provide information and referral services on testing and
counseling to the victims of sexual assaults.  The bill passed both houses and
was signed into law. </P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Utah</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Testing Criminal Defendants</B><BR>	The Utah ACLU successfully opposed
H.B. 267 which would have required mandatory HIV testing for any person accused
of a sexual offense.  An amendment attached in committee also would have
required testing of the victim of the sexual crime.  An active lobbying effort
was mounted by the ACLU and the bill died before reaching the floor of the
Legislature.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<H5>Vermont</H5></CENTER>
<P><B>Testing Criminal Defendants</B><BR>	S.B. 135 would have required a
person who is charged with a sexual offense to be tested for HIV.  The bill,
which the ACLU opposed, died in committee. </P>

<BODY BCOLOR=#FFFFFF>
<center><h1>Transcript of Substantive Plenary II<br>
 Free Speech</h1></center>
<blockquote>
<h3>Nadine Strossen, ACLU President:</h3>
<P>
              Thank you very much.  I'm
   thrilled to be here, and especially thrilled to
   introduce Erica Jong, our keynote speaker this
  morning.
<P>
              Erica Jong has been a great friend of
   free speech, as well as other civil liberties, and
   she has also exercised her own rights of free
   expression and her great gifts of expression to
   convey unforgettably to millions of people,
   worldwide, her messages, her insight, her wit and
   her wisdom.  She is one of the widest read and most
   influential women writing today.
<p>
              I have here, from her office, Erica Jong
   Productions, a very impressive document.  It was
   faxed to me under cover of a fax page form headed
   "A Zipless Fax from Erica Jong Productions."  Of
   course, that's an allusion to Ms. Jong's first
   runaway best seller, Fear of Flying, a galvanizing
   book for women and for the women's movement.
<p>  
            This impressive document outlines
   Erica's Jong's outstanding accomplishments and
   unfortunately -- fortunately, I want to have as
   much time as possible for you to hear from her, so
   I can't talk about her nearly as much as I'd like.
   So I'll give you a few highlights of her
   extraordinary career.
<p>
              In addition to having written six best
   selling novels, Ms. Jong is also an awardwinning
   poet, and has also written numerous articles and
   essays and a children's book.  It's going to be
   released, rereleased soon, one of the few books to
   help children deal positively with divorce.  And
   besides being hugely popular worldwide, her
   writings have also earned critical acclaim, as her
   18th Century style picaresque novel, Fanny, being
   the true history of the adventures of Fanny
   Hackabout Jones, which is a feminist answer to Tom
   Jones, if you will.  It was heralded by The New
   York Times in a front page review as "A quantum
   leap in literary prodigy."
<p>
              In all of her writing, Erica Jong has
   celebrated women's strengths and possibilities with
   energy and passion, and she has also given
   generously of her time to the causes of free
   expression, artists and authors' rights and women's
   rights.  Among many other things, she served as
   president of the Authors Guild of the U.S. from
   1991 to 1993.
<p>
              I have to inject a personal note,
   because I know it's so typical of Erica's
   generosity.  That while she was on a very
   strenuous, around-the-world book tour promoting her
   latest wonderful book, Fear of Fifty, A Mid-Life
   Memoir, she took the time to actually carry the
   galleys of my forthcoming book on Pornography, Free
   Speech and Feminism with her.  I understand from
   her assistant, she read them between Venice and
   Hong Kong, and wrote a very generous blurb enroute
   from Hong Kong to Australia.  She just told me that
   as a result of that blurb, Andrea Dworkin no longer
   speaks to her, so...<p>
              <b>(APPLAUSE).</b><p>
   Before closing, I can't
   resist strongly recommending to those of you who
   have not yet had the pleasure, to read Fear of
   Fifty.  It is already a best seller here and in
   half a dozen other countries.  It is a wonderfully
   inspiring book, which I have taken to giving as a
   birthday present to my many friends, including many
   of you out there, who are approaching or, indeed,
   have even crossed over the threshold of 50.  And I
   have to say, not only is the book wonderful in and
   of itself, but it's a great improvement of what
   over used to be my stock fiftieth birthday gift,
   namely the ACLU Handbook on the Rights of Older
   Persons.<p>
             <STRONG> (LAUGHTER).</STRONG><P>
              Erica, thank you very, very much for all
   you've done for the cause of human rights for
   individual human beings, women as well as men, and
   thank you for being with us here today.<p>
            <STRONG>  (APPLAUSE).</STRONG>
<P>
<H3>Erica Jong</H3>
<P>
            What a great introduction.  I
   feel the same way about Nadine.
<p>
              You know, I want to speak to you today
   about the creative imagination and censorship and
   why censorship is such a dire threat to creative
   people.  But first I want want to define some
   terms.  I think that one of the reasons that we are
   embroiled in this tremendous argument about
   censorship and where we are vis-a-vis censorship,
   the so-called Communications Decency Act that is
   being floated in the Congress of the United States,
   is because we live in a time when we have a very
   diverse population.
<P>
              And interesting enough, calls for
   censorship always increase when the population is
   extremely diverse and different standards prevail.
   This is almost a given:  When you have an elitist
   or traditional society in which everybody agrees
   about who gets access to stuff, you don't have
   calls for censorship.  They only occur in a society
   in which there are many different groups struggling
   for a place and trying to figure out whose word
   goes.
 <p>
             So it's very interesting.  It's almost a
   product of the diversity of our society that we
   have these new calls for censorship.  And I think,
   although it seems very depressing some days to open
   the paper and see so many of the things that we've
   fought for going down the drain, it's in a way a
   symbol of how much we have reached people, that
   there should be a worry about pornography on the
   internet, too free an expression of ideas and so
   on.  So maybe there is a little bit of hope here.
<p>
              Forty years ago Margaret Mead, who wrote
   beautifully about so many things that were not in
   her anthropological purview, supposedly said that
   censorship would always increase in a pluralistic
   democracy as each group warred with the other,
   trying to figure out who had the right to be on top
   and who had the right to say what other people
   could speak about.
<p>
              I think we live in a time where the
   freedom to publish sexually oriented material is
   increasingly coming under attack.  Large publishing
   conglomerates increasingly control all means of
   communication and the forces of cultural reaction
   are becoming extremely well organized.  The brief
   cultural glasnost that we enjoyed in the sixties is
   already beginning to seem quaint.  And when you
   think about this century and you think that it's
   the century that started with The Wasteland, with
   Prufrock, with Ulysses, and with great fights to
   liberate literature, which came to fruition just
   about 1962 when the Supreme Court liberated Tropic
   of Cancer.
<p>              And then, in the sixties, a time that we
   all remember, probably well, there was a moment
   when literature all over the world was changed by
   the release of Tropic of Cancer.  Suddenly authors
   didn't have to shut the bedroom door when they
   wrote about sexuality.  Suddenly, the tremendous
   force and passion of sexuality inspired the whole
   culture and created a kind of exuberance that went
   to other areas as well.
<p>              But that period of time was extremely
   narrow.  I would say 20 years, 25 years.  And then
   there was a tremendous desire for censorship
   again.  And we come to the end of the century, and
   we seem to be back in 1895.  It seems that we have
   made a complete circle.
<p>              And now the calls for censorship are
   coming not just from the right, but also from the
   left.  They are coming distressingly from
   feminists, members of my own movement, who believe,
   some of them, like Andrea Dworkin and Catharine
   MacKinnon, that there is no danger in their joining
   forces with the forces of reaction.  For example,
   Andrea Dworkin and Kitty McKinnon joined the Meese
   Commission in 1986, which was very strange.
<p>              So there are feminists who are saying:
   We don't care about the First Amendment; the First
   Amendment is sentimental; the First Amendment is
   foolish; the First Amendment is romantic and
   Rousseauish.  We don't need that, a higher good is
   protecting women and protecting women against rape
   and protecting women against being denigrated in
   print, in pictures, on the internet and so on.
<p>              Well, let's look at that and what that
   has really accomplished in the last few years.
   Basically what it has accomplished, is it has given
   guys like Dole, like Gramm, a new vocabulary.  And
   it's given people like Pat Robertson a new
   vocabulary.  Instead of having to say now they are
   for censorship, because they want to keep all women
   barefoot and pregnant in Christ, they can now say:
   We are protecting women against denigration and
   abuse.  And the reason that we want the
   Communications Decency Act is in order to protect
   women.
 <p>             In other words, they have taken the
   vocabulary that Dworkin and McKinnon have given
   them and they've used it to drape their old
   barefoot and pregnant ideas.  So they've become
   very much harder to counter.  All those same old
   farts, the alter kockers in the Congress who sat
   there when Anita Hill was being pilloried and
   toremented, and who didn't understand anything, who
   didn't get it, they are getting up and saying:  We
   are protecting women against denigration and abuse.
<p>              So basically, what Dworkin and McKinnon
   have done for the evangelical right, is that
   they've given them a new dialect that they can use
   to cloak their very, very ancient ideas.  And
   that's even more terrifying, I think, than anything
   else that they've done and they seem not to
   understand that they've done this.
<P>              I'm not so interested in talking to you
   about why it's important to have free sexual
   expression in society, because I think probably
   many of us here agree with that.  But I want to
   talk about why people are so interested in
   censoring expression when there are so many other
   problems in our society that need addressing.
<P>              I think that people become hysterical
   about expression when they feel out of control:
   They cannot stop rape.  Children are raised in a
   way that they are not parented, they are not
   educated, they are not given values, there are too
   many of them, they are too poor, they are too ill,
   they are too hungry.  Instead of addressing these
   problems in society, problems that come from
   overpopulation, problems that come from the
   breakdown of the family, problems that come from
   the severe inequity of financial access between
   races, between rich and poor, instead of addressing
   these questions, which are the real questions, it's
   easier to address expression and censorship.  It's
   easier to get up and rave about how our society is
   being corrupted by pornographic images on the
   internet.  Much easier to talk about that than it
   is to talk about the fact that there is inequality
   economically and that because there is inequality
   economically, we have people who are not socsocialized
   to be part of our society, and we don't know what
   to do about that problem, so let's talk about
   censorship and expression.
<P>              It is absolutely a red herring.  It is
   total bullshit.  It is like arresting prostitutes
   instead of Johns.<P>
             <STRONG> (APPLAUSE).</STRONG>
<P>              Do you remember last year there was a
   mayor, I believe it was in Miami, who decided that
   she was going to have the names of the Johns who
   frequented prostitutes read on television and
   printed in the newspaper?  And I thought, what a
   sensible idea.  Rather than arresting these women
   whose financial lack of access has put them in this
   profession, which is the only way they can make
   money, instead, expose the guys who are using the
   prostitutes.  Don't criminalize these poor women.
<P>              It never lasted very long.  It spread to
   a couple of other cities, but basically it didn't
   last very long.  And we have a perfectly analogous
   situation, for example, in the whole debate about
   pornography.  If criminal acts are perpetrated when
   pornography is made, if a child is injured, if a
   woman is drugged and raped during the making of a
   pornographic film, why not arrest these guys for
   rape or for child molestation.  We have plenty of
   laws on the books that protect against rape and
   child molestation.
<P>              But, no, that would mean that we were
   going to come down on organized crime, which
   basically profits from pornography, and that's too
   hard.  Perhaps it's too hard because organized
   crime basically contributes to the PAC funds of the
   people in the Congress.  Who knows why?  Maybe it's
   too hard to do that.  Better to jump on expression
   and say that free expression is causing these
   problems.
<P>              So look at the underside of the
   problem.  Look at this great debate that we've been
   having about censorship, free expression, the
   internet.  It's not really about that.  It's not
   really about whether it's good or bad to have
   Tropic of Cancer out there so people can read it.
   It is not really about any of the things that it
   claims to be about.
<P>              What it is really about is that people
   do not know how to stop the Mafia from selling
   pornography in which children are abused, or they
   don't want to do it because they profit in some way
   from it.
<P>              And so instead of going to the root of
   the problem, instead of exposing the Johns,
   basically it's much much easier to beat up on a
   bunch of fuzzy minded liberals who want to make
   little distinctions about what is right and what is
   wrong, i.e. us.
<P>              And we play right into their tendency to
   smokescreen the real problems, because as members
   of the left we're more interested in fighting each
   other than in fighting our real enemies.  We love
   to fight each other.  We love to make subtle
   distinctions and argue with each other.
<P>              And I think that we better really look
   at what's going on in our culture and we better
   look at who profits from pornography.  And we
   better look at the laws that we already have and
   which ones are enforced and which ones aren't.  And
   we better stop letting them make it an issue of
   censorship versus free speech, because really it's
   not about that.  It's about economics at the
   bottom.  It's about the fact that women and
   children are the lowest priority in this society.
   It's about the fact that women and children's
   rights are cut first.  It's about the fact that our
   teenage daughters can't walk on the streets without
   danger of being raped.  It's about a total social
   breakdown and it has absolutely nothing to do with
   expression, that is a smokescreen.
<P>              And suddenly, after having these endless
   conversations on TV with all kinds of people from
   Phyllis Schafley to Claire Short -- the shadow
   minister of labor, in England, who is calling for
   censorship of pornography because it's a wonderful
   way for her to get elected -- it suddenly occurred
   to me that this is not the issue at all.  And I
   would ask you, as my colleagues, to please address
   the basic issue.
<P>              Rather than arguing with the people who
   would censor, about whether or not this is
   censorship.  I would look at the root causes.  I
   would look at the root causes of why people
   participate in pornography.  I would look at the
   inequalities, the economic inequalities that
   underlie the system and I would address those and
   not be jollied into this whole argument about
   censorship.  Because the truth is that anybody's
   political agenda, if it is not your own, is
   obscene.
<P>              <STRONG>(LAUGHTER).</STRONG>
<P>              And basically censorship, once it gets
   on the books, is always used in that way, to
   politically harass the dissenter.  The reason I
   remain a First Amendment fundamentalist, is because
   I understand as a feminist, as a Jew, as a woman,
   as a woman who has been battered for expressing
   herself freely in all her books, I understand the
   First Amendment protects the minority, protects the
   dissenter, protects the woman, protects the witch.
<P>              Basically, I understand that unless you
   have a government of laws, rather than a government
   of people, you cannot protect dissent.  And I
   understand, as a woman who probably would have been
   burned in the marketplace for witchcraft only about
   200 years ago, that I need the First Amendment more
   than anybody does.  And that even if I am repelled
   by child pornography or Bob Guccione's productions,
   that I have to protect those things, because
   essentially it's in my self-interest to do so.
<P>              So those are the terms of the debate,
   the way I would define it now, and I would really
   invite your questions.
<P>
<H3>Burt Neuborne, Professor of Constitutional Law, New York University</H3>
<P>
              <STRONG>MR. NEUBORNE:</STRONG>  Thank you.  And thank
   you, Erica, for what was really a wonderful,
   wonderful talk.
<P>              In fact, it's stimulated me to tell a
   story that some of you may have heard, because I
   used to tell it 10, 15 years ago, when it actually
   happened to me.  But it seems to me so consistent
   with the theme of Erica's remarks, that it's worth
   reminding some of you of and maybe telling some of
   you for the first time.
<P>              For many years my wife and I were, I
   think, the last middle class residents of
   Brooklyn.  We lived across the bridge and we would
   come into Manhattan to see shows.  And so, we drove
   in one night and I couldn't find a parking space.
   And I didn't want to take out a second mortgage, so
   I was driving around looking for a parking place.
   I dropped Helen at the theater and drove around and
   found a parking space on about, oh, I'd say 10th
   Avenue and about 50th Street, where a nice bunch of
   kids said they'd watch the car for me.
<P>              So I dropped the car off and walked over
   to 8th Avenue and started walking south, down 8th
   Avenue to get to the theater.  And I walked past a
   doorway, and from the doorway comes, psst, psst.  I
   look at the doorway and it is a beautiful woman all
   dressed up who wants to suggest a commercial
   transaction with me.  With my usual aplomb I said,
   no, and I tripped over the curb.  I walked away and
   kept walking south.  I get to the next block and I
   pass a doorway and from the doorway I hear psst
   psst, look at the doorway and it's a guy six eight,
   dressed head to toe in black leather and he wants
   to discuss certain relationships that we could have
   as well.  I said, no.  I walked past him, got down
   to the next block, out of the doorway comes, psst
   psst.  I look into the doorway and there is some
   guy who says, I've got stuff to smoke, stuff to
   snort, anything you want.  Do you want to do a
   deal?  I say, get lost.
<P>              I walked past him and grabbed a pretzel
   from the pretzel lady.  As I turned the corner -- I
   had skipped dinner -- I am walking into the theater
   and the last thing I see as I walk into the
   theater, are the police arresting the pretzel lady
   for vending without a permit.
<P>              Now, that's directly related to the
   message of Erica Jong's talk.  It doesn't matter
   whether are a society, whether you are a law
   school, whether you are an ACLU, whether you are a
   police force:  Confronted with hard problems and
   with easy problems, we will all choose to deal with
   the easy problems.  We will attempt to arrest
   pretzel ladies whenever we can, because what it does,
   it keeps us busy when we know we have a hard time
dealing with the more difficult problems in life.
<P>              She's absolutely right when she
   characterizes censorship as a grand form of
   arresting pretzel ladies.  Censorship gives the
   illusion that politicians are dealing with serious
   social problems.  It is a part of a great disease
   we have in this country, which is a politics of
   symbolism.  Politics in the United States has been
   turned into a huge shadow play, where a group of,
   usually men, go behind a screen and act out
   symbolic events and then think they've done
   something very important in terms of dealing with
   society.  And censorship is, of course, the
   quintessential symbolic event.  It is a statement
   of value, a statement of aspiration and it avoids
   having to ask hard questions of what you do about
   serious problems.
<P>              One of the things, one of the great joys
   of having been associated with the ACLU for all
   these years, it is one of the organizations in
   American life, I think it is probably our principal
   role to keep telling the society to stop arresting
   pretzel ladies.  That's our job, and the job really
   of free speech, I mean, the function that free
   expression plays in society, is to make it
   impossible to sweep problems under the rug, to make
   it impossible to pretend to ourselves that there
   aren't 25 percent of Americans that went to bed
   last night without the same chances that all of us
   take for granted.
<P>              And that that other America, the America
   that's been left behind, and that is in such
   jeopardy at this point, free expression is
   ultimately their only hope.  Because the only hope
   of continuing to set the national agenda and to
   insist that politicians stop playing games and
   start dealing with issues, is an uncensored flow of
   information that will force us, if anything will
   ever force us, to be better than we are and to come
   to grips with these problems.
<P>              I can stand here now and I can say to
   you:  If we've had one success story in my years in
   the ACLU, it's been the First Amendment.  One
   continual effort to keep open the channels of
   communication, it's been the First Amendment.
<P>              And there is a reason.  One reason is
   that there is a natural coalescence between the
   left and the right on the First Amendment.  It
   wasn't a coincidence, you know, the flag burning
   case, that the key vote in the flag burning case
   was Anthony Scalia.  Just as it isn't a
   coincidence, when he wakes up and decides to be
   honest, instead of posturing, Newt Gingrich doesn't
   think censorship on the internet is a good idea.
   That is because right libertarians and left
   libertarians understand in a deep sense that there
   is a commonality of interest in keeping expression
   open.
<P>              And so the suggestion from the floor
   that we not write the right off in the First
   Amendment war is exactly right.  There is a very
   strong --<P>
             <STRONG> (APPLAUSE).</STRONG>
<P>               -- a very strong coalescence and a
   very strong commonality in interest that we can use
   effectively and strategically in order to advance
   freedom for everybody in the country, and I can say
   to you with a good deal of pride, that that's been
   our strategy.  In the 1970s, in the national
   office, we sat around and we talked about free
   speech being essentially a left phenomenon in this
   country, that free speech was something that
   benefited the left, that the left liked what the
   right didn't like, that authoritarians were always
   standing up trying to bash it, libertarians tended
   to be -- left wing libertarians who were defending
   it, we said, look, unless we find ways to broaden
   the idea of free speech, to create a constituency
   that transcends our own narrow political aims, free
   speech will be in danger.  All the precedents in
   the world won't help free speech once it loses its
   deep political constituency in the nation.  And
   that led to what was, for some of us, a troubling
   political judgment, but I think an absolutely
   correct, both strategic and moral judgment, and
   that is, the ACLU threw its support behind things
   like corporate speech, commercial speech, speech of
   the right, speech that gave the right a strong
   vested interest in the continuation of a powerful
   First Amendment.
<P>              That coalescence is what bore fruit in
   the flag burning case.  It's why Scalia looks at
   free speech and says:  There's something in it for
   me.  And it is important for us to remind everybody
   in this country that there is something in it for
   them.  So that we have had, I think, a very
   powerful success story in putting together public
   education, the creation of political self-interest
   and the creation of powerful intellectual ideas
   that have translated themselves into strong
   precedent.
<P>              Now, the question is what do we do for
   an encore?  What do we do now in this area of free
   speech?  It's obvious that we keep fighting the
   traditional battles.  The Exon amendment, the
   counter-terrorism nonsense, the flag burning stuff,
   all of that is traditional efforts by
   authoritarians to reimpose restrictions on free
   expression.  It has to be fought and fought as hard
   as we can.
<P>              I will just mention to you, in just a
   few seconds, something that bothers me.  It bothers
   me when I work on ACLU briefs, it bothered me when
   I worked on the St. Pat's brief, it bothers me when
   I work on the hate speech briefs, it bothers me
   when I work on some of the briefs involving
   political contributions, and that is this:
<P>              Having succeeded, I think succeeded
   beyond our wildest expectations, in creating a
   legal and political structure in which free
   expression is extraordinarily protected, we may
   have created problems for the culture that flow out
   of the existence of free expression.  After all, we
   are -- no culture has ever really had free
   expression for a very long time.  We may be the
   first to be experimenting with free expression at
   the level we are.
<P>              So we're beginning to learn that when
   you do have free expression, there is pain
   involved.  There is pain involved because it
   disproportionately empowers the rich.  There is
   pain involved, because it hurts weak people who are
   harmed by the expression and who find it difficult
   to deal with the expression.  It hurts because it
   tends to coarsen the culture by creating the lowest
   common denominator of ambient noise that we are
   surrounded by.
<P>              Now, not for a minute do I suggest that
   those harms would justify going back to
   censorship.  But as an organization that has always
   been ahead of the wave, as an organization that
   built the existing First Amendment because we saw,
   10 and 20 years ago that we could build a great
   national coalition of left and right behind it, it
   seems to me that we should be very, very aware that
   the next wave is how the culture is going to deal
   with the fruits of the expression, with the pain,
   with the coarseness, with the inequality.
<P>              And that as an organization, we now have
   to be thinking of ways to lessen that pain.  It's
   our job -- I used to say to people:  The ACLU's job
   is not just to say no.  Our job is also to say
   yes.  Our job is also to develop solutions for
   social problems, not just to stand around and tell
   people that their solutions are unconstitutional.
   So it seems to me that we have an obligation as an
   institution now, to take seriously the cries of
   pain that come from gays when they're excluded from
   the parade, and the cries of pain that come from
   women when they feel that they've been harmed or
   cheapened in some way by speech, and the cries of
   pain that come from the poor when they are excluded
   from the political debate.
  <P> 
           And take those, take those cries
   seriously, respond that censorship can't be the way
   that we deal with your pain.  That the ACLU can't
   walk away from that pain.  It is our job to help
   this culture develop mechanisms that deal with the
   pain, that don't include censorship.
<P>

<P>
<P>              I was just curious, to start here:  How
   many people in this room have access to the
   internet?
<P>              Hey, all right.
<P>              This morning, before I came, I decided
   to send an obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy and
   indecent E-mail message to Senator Exon, but I
   couldn't.  He doesn't have an E-mail address.  He's
   not on the internet, so unfortunately I couldn't do
   that.
<P>              But I did, in scouring through some
   on-line forums today, I found some words.  The
   Senate has a chaplain and on the morning that they
   passed the indecency act or whatever they call it,
   he gave his prayer.  And I wanted to -- I thought
   the words were kind of moving, so I wanted to share
   that with you.
<P>              "Almighty God, we praise you for the
   advancements in computerized communications that we
   enjoy in our time.  Sadly, however, there are those
   who are letting this information -- who are
   littering this information highway with obscene,
   indecent and destructive pornography.  Virtual but
   virtueless reality is projected in the most
   twisted, sick, misuse of sexuality.  Violent people
   with sexual pathology are able to stalk and harass
   the innocent.  Cyber solicitation of teenagers
   reveals a dark side of on-line victimization."
   Et cetera, et cetera.
<P>              I mean, no wonder they passed that act,
   my God.
<P>              I would -- before you all rush out to
   embrace the right wing and, you know, get carried
   away with that -- I would like to point out that
   the vote in the Senate was 84 to 16 and there were
   plenty of liberal people who voted for that act,
   including a couple of Senators from my home state
   of California, Senator Boxer, who I think she's a
   liberal, anyway, the last time I checked.
   Feinstein is more middle of the road.  But they
   both voted for that act, so, you know, it seems
   like we have a lot of work to do among our own kind
   before we embrace people on the right like Newt
   Gingrich.
<P>              Anyway, what I really want to discuss
   with you is why it is really important to protect
   free speech on the internet and what it is about
   the internet that is truly important.  Really,
   on-line computing is about speech, that's what
   people do on-line.  The difference is it's
   electronic waves instead of sound waves.  People
   participate in forums, in bulletin boards.  And the
   fight over censorship on the net is really a
   smokescreen for control of the only place that I
   know of, where almost anyone can talk to the
   masses.
<P>              You may not realize this, but the
   internet is not owned by Rupert Murdoch or Ted
   Turner, or anybody.  The internet is free and open
   and available to everyone.  For the cost of $500,
   you can go to a book store and buy the software to
   set up your own internet node and become a
   publisher and have access to millions of people.
   Currently about seven million people are on the
   worldwide web.  By the year 2000 it's projected
   that this number will reach 40 million people.
<P>              And you, as an individual, a student in
   high school or college could start a magazine or a
   newspaper on the internet at a very low cost, using
   a Macintosh or a PC, and the appropriate software
   and reach just as many people as Rupert Murdoch
   reaches with his Fox cable TV networks, and that is
   what is revolutionary and very important about this   
precious new medium.  The fact is it's not owned by
   anyone, it's accessible to everyone.
<P>              It's one to make communications.  It is
   the medium that will give us the power to turn the
   tables on the publishing industry, to turn the
   tables on a government that is too much in the
   hands and the control of lobbyists and special
   interests.
<P>              It is the medium that will give
   individuals power and give individuals
   opportunity.  It is a medium that we can use, this
   organization and others, to organize people, to
   galvanize people, to get people on the move again,
   to educate them.
<P>              The net is the breeding ground for
   revolution and treason, and that --<P>
              (<STRONG>APPLAUSE).</STRONG>
<P>              -- that is the reason that we have this
   move to censor it, that's what people are really
   afraid of.
<P>              They're not afraid of pornography on the
   internet.  There is so little of it compared to the
   vast amount of information on the internet.  You
   would get this impression from reading the
   newspapers, that's all that the internet is about,
   it is dirty pictures.  Well, that's just baloney.
   It's such a small, teeny fraction.  You know, a
   hundredth of a percent of the content of the
   internet has to do with pornography, the rest has
   to do with all kinds of information and material
   from all kinds of people.
<P>              There are at least 25,000 internet sites
   today.  There will be 100,000 soon.  Each of these
   internet sites is really a publishing station.  And
   what the economics of this, I think you understand,
   is that you don't have to pay for the cost of paper
   and printing and distribution.  You just put it on
   your computer and people come to you and they can
   download and access it.
<P>              The internet is going to change
   everything and it's very important that we stand
   behind it and don't allow it to be censored.
<P>              There are ways, in fact, that
   individuals, parents, if you are concerned about
   your children, you can censor it yourself with
   things called filters and blockers.  This is
   software that is being developed that allows -- you
   put it on your machine and it will just block out
   all the sex forums and things like that.  So there
   are ways that the individual parent can be
   empowered to control what their children are
   looking at on the internet.  And this is a much
   better solution than censoring the whole thing for
   everybody.
<P>              Of course, there are some problems with
   that, too.  There is some software called Surf
   Watch.  The other day there was quite an uproar
   about Surf Watch, because the people who are
   developing Surf Watch decided any forum with the
   word "lesbian" or "gay" or "homosexual" in them
   had, by their very nature, had to do with sexually
   explicit material, so they just censored all of
   that.
<P>              One of the things that they blocked out
   was the International Association of Gay Square
   Dance Clubs.  And when this was pointed out to
   them, they did back off and change it.  So there's
   even dangers there, that software like Surf Watch,
   which goes to individuals, pretty soon parents
   could demand that you have Surf Watch on all the
   computers at schools and libraries and such.  So we
   have censorship coming at us from all kinds of
   directions.
   <P>           I want to tell you, though, that this
   will never fly, the Communication Decency Act will
   never fly because of the technology.  It's very
   impractical.  It's written by people that have no
   comprehension of what on-line communications are
   all about.  The reason it will never fly is that
   thousands and thousands and thousands of people
   will immediately start putting up millions and
   millions of obscene messages and pictures on the
   internet as soon as that law goes into effect, and
   there just aren't enough jail cells for all of us.
<STRONG>(APPLAUSE).</STRONG>
<P>              That's why it will never fly.
<P>              I guarantee you, that will happen.
   There are people publishing newsletters today
   on-line, that are just ordinary business
   newsletters, that have announced that they are
   going to fill these newsletters full of filthy
   words, if this Communication Decency Act passes.
   <P>           I just want to close on a quote from a
   fellow named Thomas Jefferson.  He one time said,
   "I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is
   a good thing.  And it's necessary in the political
   world, as storms are in the physical world.  It is
   a medicine necessary for the sound health of
   government."
              Thank you.
<P>
<H3>Laura W. Murphy, Director, ACLU National Washington Office</H3>
<P>
       Thank you, Barry, and thanks  to all of the panelists.
<P>              I feel like there is a certain
   atmosphere of optimism and happiness, that we ought
   to take these things in stride, we shouldn't get
   too excited.  But again, my role is to get excited
   about these things that are happening to the Bill
   of Rights and to the Constitution.  And
   notwithstanding Ira's tremendous talk and uplifting
   talk about how far we've come in 75 years, and
   notwithstanding Burt Neuborne's talk about how far
   we've come with regard to the First Amendment, and
   notwithstanding the fact that Newt Gingrich has
   seen the light on censorship on the internet.
<P>              I think we are under assault in the
   Congress on the First Amendment from every
   conceivable direction.  It's what you hear, with
   whom you associate, when and where and how you
   pray, what you say, what you see, the right to
   petition the government.  The First Amendment is
   one of the focal points of all of the leadership in
   the Congress.
<P>              It's as if censorship of indecent, lewd
   and lascivious words on the internet is not enough,
   as if a flag desecration constitutional amendment
   is not enough.  As if a constitutional amendment,
   which is the cornerstone of the Contract with the
   American Family, that would allow religious
   expression in public places is not enough, or
   restrictions on the rights of nonprofit groups to
   lobby is not enough, school vouchers, all of that.
<P>              We have, what I think is a watershed
   crisis embodied in the bill, the counter terrorism
   bill that is now coursing it's way quickly through
   the United States Congress.
<P>              Several days ago it passed in the Senate
   on a vote of 91 to 8.  And this bill is the real
   wolf in sheep's clothing with regard to the First
   Amendment.  It's lurking out there, ready to pounce
   on a number of freedoms that we've come to enjoy.
   And the funny thing about this bill is that Joe Six
   Pack and the average activist has no idea how this
   bill will curtail their rights, much less the very
   sophisticated editorial writer of your major
   dailies.
<P>              This Trojan Horse, sold to the American
   people as protection against future World Trade
   Center bombings and Oklahoma City bombings, is
   nothing more than a massive dismantling of the
  freedom to associate and the freedom of expression.
<P>              The House Judiciary Committee, for its
   part, voted 23 to 12, to pass this out of the House
   Judiciary Committee.  And the only opportunity that
   we can have to stop this terrible piece of
   legislation is on the House floor.
<P>              And I hold some limited optimism about
   this because, in part, in the closing days of the
   Judiciary Committee's consideration of this bill,
   we had four ultra-conservative Republicans who also
   voted against the bill.  And these were four that
   we targeted, the ACLU targeted to vote against this
   legislation.  And they were concerned about the
   impact that this legislation would have on their
   constituency.
<P>              Let me talk about some of the things
   that the bill will do, in case you aren't aware.
   It would allow the Secretary of State to designate
   any group a terrorist organization.  It's a form of
   blacklisting that would not be subject to
   meaningful judicial review.  And terrorism would
   then become defined not as a series of criminal
   acts, which it is, but as a series of
   associations.  So that even people who give to
   organizations unknowingly, thinking that they're
   giving for charitable and humane purposes, like the
   IRA orphans fund, or the hospital for the ANC, they
   would be, then, guilty of contributing to terrorist
   activity and they would be subject to criminal
   penalties and they would be subject to fines up to
   $50,000 and their assets could be seized by the
   federal government.
<P>              This is, indeed, a dark day for civil
   liberties if this kind of thing is allowed to
   pass.  Just think of the chilling impact that this
   legislation would have on people who believe that
   the U.S. government is engaged in activity abroad
   that runs counter to their opinions.
<P>              One person's freedom fighter is another
   person's terrorist.  I remember the days when the
   African National Congress was deemed to be a
   terrorist organization.  Who would have guessed in
   our lifetime its leader is now the head of the
   Republic of South Africa.  That is the kind of
   arbitrary and capricious power given to the
   executive branch.
<P>              Democrats would be delighted if I said
   that this bill was only a creature of Senator Dole
   and Newt Gingrich and Henry Hyde, but it is not.
   The impetus for this legislation came from the
   President of the United States, Bill Clinton.  And
   had he not appeared on the Larry King Live program
   two or three days before the Senate vote, and said
   that he believes that this terrorism bill had to
   pass quickly, and he believed that this terrorism
   bill had to pass with a repeal of the habeas corpus
   laws, what's left of them, we would not have had
   such a horrible bill. We met with a senator the day
   of the vote, and he admitted that the President had
   pulled the rug from out under the Democrats in the
   Senate.
<P>              We had them primed to offer amendments
   so that there could be a counter terrorism bill
   that didn't violate civil liberties.  I agree very
   much with what Burt Neuborne said:  Our role in
   Washington isn't just to say no.  Our role is to
   offer meaningful alternatives.  We had a series of
   meaningful alternatives that would not allow roving
   wiretaps; that would not allow the executive branch
   to have this far-reaching power without meaningful
   judicial review; that would not allow people to be
   deported in star-chamber proceedings.
<P>              But the President, in his desire to
   appear tough on crime and his desire to believe
   that he ought to have common cause with Senator
   Dole, who is running for president, pulled the rug
   out from under the Democrats.
<P>              We have Republicans, too, who were
   willing to limit the ability of the FBI to engage
   in wiretaps.  We had a bipartisan effort primed to
   go, but politics ruled the day.  And I hold Bill
   Clinton, and I hold Bob Dole responsible for the
   fast-tracking of this legislation.
<P>              We have some window of opportunity in
   the next couple of weeks. This bill is going to come
   to the House floor as early as July 10th. We have
   some window of opportunity to make our concerns
   known.  But I urge you to attend the workshop that
   will be headed by our legislative counsel, Greg
   Nojeim, who will go into detail about the horrors
   of this legislation.
<P>              I just think that in our effort to stick
   to our agenda, whether it is church-state issues,
   whether it is free speech issues, censorship, this
   wolf in sheep's clothing, we will rue the day that
   we didn't speak up, that we didn't get active.
<P>              I'm very proud to be in the Washington
   office at this time.  It's a lonely job.  One of
   the criticisms of our office under my leadership is
   that we are too principled.  I'm proud to be
   principled in a time when people are selling us
   down the river, left and right.  And I'm proud to
   say that we are not a left organization or a right
   organization.  We are nonpartisan in our concerns,
   in our criticisms and the people that we work
   with.  If the NRA wants to join us opposing the
   counter terrorism bill, that's fine; if the
   Christian Coalition wants to have us on their
   program to talk about broad new powers of the
   federal government, that's fine.
<P>              What we've got to do, is convince the
   Republicans that it will be their ox that's going
   to be gored by this legislation as much as ours.
   We have to convince them that Joe Six Pack, who
   wants to march around in fatigues, but who is not
   interested in planting a bomb in a federal
   building, will be wiretapped, will be infiltrated
   by the FBI.  And this comes on top of Louis Freeh
   testifying before the House and Senate Judiciary
   Committee about his new interpretation of the FBI
   guidelines.  How he and the Justice Department
   worked together to expand their authority in
   certain areas, but has refused to share this new
   interpretation with the members of the Congress and
   with the American people.  And how do we respond?
   We heap new powers on the FBI to engage in roving
   wiretaps, to give the FBI good-faith exceptions to
   use information that's illegally seized.
<P>              We've got to put a stop to this kind of
   legislation.  And we've got to pull the cover off
   things that are related to crime and violence in
   our society.  Everyone is concerned about crime and
   violence in our society, but we also have to
   understand that beneath these issues is a
   reorganization of the power that the federal
   government now holds.
   <P>           They want vast new powers.  This is
   nothing different than what the Reagan
   administration wanted, what the Bush administration
   wanted, and it's being given to us by Bill Clinton,
   and we must resist it.
 <P>             And so while I'm very happy to be here
   and very happy to put these issues in historical
   context, our work on every aspect of the First
   Amendment, whether it's the Contract with the
   American Family, and school vouchers, and religious
   expression, constitutional amendments, or our
   efforts on flag desecration, on every aspect of the
   First Amendment the rights that we have enjoyed in
   the last few decades are at risk.
              Thank you.

<BR>Headquartered in San Francisco, CARAL (California Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League) is a non-profit organization dedicated to electing
pro-choice candidates to office. Their web page provides information about the 
organization, a 1994 voter's guide that is specific to California, a list of
abortion-related sites, a clinic violence page, and a listing of California
politics resources. Most notably, the site contains an &quot;activists oasis,&quot;
consisting of a wealth of information and resources for those who want to become
more involved.

(not a very extensive list), Supreme Court decisions about abortion, responding
to... (editorials put up by the authors in response to anti-choice criticisms),
and anti-abortion terrorism. While this site does not provide a comprehensive
listing of information or resources, it is a good place to start for general
information on abortion, clinic violence, and rebuttals to anti-choice

<CENTER><H2>ACLU Clients - Yvonne Nicoletti</H2></CENTER>
<img src="/graphics/nicoleti.jpg" align=left><blockquote><font size=4> Yvonne Nicoletti is from Andover, Massachusetts. In 1994, she was
represented by the ACLU of Massachusetts in an important First Amendment
case.
<P>
Yvonne's saga started one day her senior year when she wore her favorite
T-shirt to school. The shirt advertised the alternative rock group White
Zombie and bore the image of two fully clothed, large-breasted women.  The
vice-principal told Yvonne that the size of the women's breasts made the
T-shirt "obscene" and that she would have to go home and change.  Yvonne, a
self-described radical feminist and opponent of censorship, instead held a
peaceful, one-woman demonstration on a large rock outside her school to
protest the censorship.  At one point, she </blockquote><br clear=all>
slipped her bra through her
sleever and put it on over the offending images.  The police then arrived in
three cruisers and a motorcycle, arrested Yvonne, and charged her with
"disturbing a school."  The charge carries a jail sentence of up to 30 days.
<P>
Yvonne was held in a jail cell for three hours before bail was posted.
During that time she wrote a statement about her thoughts and feelings on
being locked for expressing herself.  [quote!]
<P>
The case was supposed to go to trial on July 10, but the district
attorney of Essex County chose not to pursue the charges, and the court filed
the case without a finding.  In the words of ACLU attorney John Reinstein,
the case simply "went away."
<P>
Yvonne graduated from Andover High in June and is now pursuing a singing
career in California.</font>

<center><h1>Transcript of Substantive Plenary I<br>
The ACLU In The Next 75 Years</center></h1>
<blockquote>
 MR. GLASSER:  I want to start off with a civil liberties problem, and I suppose an apology of sorts to the audience watching this on television.

                            I have been berated already by our
                 public relations people for not wearing a suit
                 and tie, since CSPAN and CNN are here.  But as
                 most of you know, what's more important than the
                 way we look is what we say and who we are.  And
                 anyway, this is pretty dressy for me at an ACLU
                 biennial conference.  Gone are the days of the
                 tie-dyed T-shirt.  But this is, after all, not a
                 congressional hearing.
<p>
                            Besides, I have worn television blue,
                 which I thought was an interesting concession of
                 principle, and besides, I've retained several
                 lawyers here to represent me if somebody tries to
                 throw me off.  And some of them have suits and
                 some of them don't, so we are we'll equipped to
                 proceed.
                            What I want to talk to you about
                 today, you may be surprised to hear, is morality.
                 The Bill of Rights, adopted over 200 years ago,
                 is mostly seen as a legal instrument.  It's a constitutional instrument and we, the ACLU, and
                 in the fora of public opinion in which we speak,
                 always speak in terms of law and the
                 constitution.  We don't often address the
                 question of morality, the moral nature of the
                 rights that we pursue, the moral nature of
                 equality before the law, and the moral
                 underpinnings of what the Bill of Rights was
                 about before it was a legal document.
<p>

                            That is important today, because we
                 are being assaulted with the belief that somehow
                 we are a nation in moral decline.  We are being
                 told by the new merchants of virtue that the
                 fifties were a wonderful time and we should go
                 back to those times.  That now we are a nation in
                 steep moral decline.  We hear it from William
                 Bennett, who actually writes a book called The
                 Book of Virtues.  We hear it from Gertrude
                 Himmelfarb and Newt Gingrich, who talk to us
                 about the need to revive Victorian morality, as
                 if somehow the problem of the poor in the days of
                 Charles Dickens was not the industrial revolution
                 and the power loom, but the morals, the personal
                 morals of their behavior.
<p>

We hear it from Jesse Helms, who has
                 become an art critic.  And we hear it from Robert
                 Dole, who has become a film critic, even without
                 watching the films, which is a best way to become
                 a film critic.
<p>

                            Over and over again, we see headlines
                 and polls which indicate that people somehow
                 really have come to believe that we are a nation
                 in moral decline, that something terrible
                 happened in the sixties that loosened the
                 wonderful moral bonds of the fifties.
<p>

                            By not responding to that and by
                 responding only in terms of the law and of the
                 Constitution, we miss a great opportunity, and we
                 concede much, too much.
<p>

                            We are a more moral nation today than
                 we were in the fifties, not a less moral nation.
<p>
                            [APPLAUSE]
<p>

                            The reasons are important to discuss.
                 And they are important to discuss publicly, and
                 it is an issue.  The issue of values and morality
                 are not issues we should shrink from or concede.
<p>

                            The fact of the matter is, that if you
                 look closely at what the merchants of virtue are saying,
	   they are measuring the nation's orality
                 by essentially personal choices and personal
                 behavior.  They don't like our sexual choices.
                 They don't like the decisions people are making
                 about whom to love and whom to commit their lives
                 to.  They don't like the fact that some people
                 prefer marijuana over martinis.  They don't like
                 the fact that people are having babies out of
                 wedlock, as if somehow that was an invention of
                 welfare mothers, never before seen in the world.
                 They don't like, above all, that we are not
                 pious, especially in public.
<p>

                            They trace a great deal of the moral
                 problems to the fact that the schools no longer
                 conduct prayer ceremonies every day.  And they
                 worry about the fact, and they say, well, somehow
                 if we could reinstitute prayer in the public
                 schools and expose kids to the formal prayer
                 every day, we would take a step back, they say,
                 on the road to morality.
<p>

                            They talk about the flag, even as a
                 sacred instrument.  They talk about the flag
                 desecration.  Well, in order to desecrate
                 something, of course, it has to be sacred in the 
	   first place.  And since when was the flag a
                 religious document.
<p>

                            They are so strong about this moral
                 decline, that they are willing to amend the
                 constitution which has stood us in good stead for
                 200 years.  In order to achieve it, they are
                 willing to punish people and force them, by law,
                 to observe moral behavior, personal behavior,
                 that they approve.  They are willing to use the
                 power of the state to do that.
<p>

                            If a woman decides to choose to
                 terminate a pregnancy, to have a baby or not have
                 a baby, it is their business to quarrel with that
                 choice and enforce their view on her by law.

                            If you look at what they mean when
                 they talk about morality and moral decline, it is
                 all about personal behavior, which there are a
                lot of different opinions about, even in this
                room, they might be surprised to learn.
<p>
                            But I think that the morality of a
                 nation is really measured by different things
                 than personal behavior.  The morality of a nation
                 is measured by how the society orders itself to
                 treat its people; by whether or not justice and 
	   fairness prevails; by whether or not people are
                 free to pursue happiness as they see fit; by
                 whether or not people are equal before the law;
                 by whether or not it is safe to be different in a

                 world in which the majority rules.
<p>

                            Those are the moral principles that

                 this country began with.  Those are what we used

                 to call civic virtue, public virtue, as opposed

                 to personal virtue, which is not the government's

                 business and not society's business.  But what is

                 the government's business and what is the

                 society's business is civic virtue, it is the way

                 the society is ordered to treat its citizens.
<p>

                            Now, measured by that kind of

                 morality, the fifties were a time of moral

                 depravity and the sixties a time of great moral

                 advance.  Think about it.  In the 1950s racial

                 segregation and subjugation prevailed, cemented

                 into the law and enforced by state-sanctioned

                 terrorism in some of the states of this country,

                 and prevailed by custom and practice in most

                 other states.  People of darker skin color, for

                 that reason alone, were denied the right to serve

                 on juries, denied the right to vote, denied the right to frequent places of public

                 accommodations, like restaurants, hotels,

                 swimming pools and even public toilets, were

                 denied employment, were denied everything that it

                 is a citizens' right to have.
<p>

                            Was that moral?
<p>

                            At the same time that this was going

                 on, the states where it was going on most

                 harshly, and which were killing people, killing

                 people with state sanction who dared to protest

                 against it, those were the states that had the

                 most schools that conducted daily prayer

                 sessions.
<p>

                            Now, I am not suggesting -- as my good

                 friend William Buckley might, in one of his

                 perorations on correlation -- I am not suggesting

                 that the presence of school prayer led to the

                 absence of racial morality.
<p>

                            What I am suggesting is that there was

                 no relationship.  What I am suggesting is that

                 whether Mississippi was a moral state in 1950 was

                 not to be measured by the number of schools that

                 conducted prayer ceremonies for their kids.  It

                 was to be measured by the way Mississippi was
	   ordered to treat its black citizens.
<p>
                            [APPLAUSE]
<p>

                            During the 1950s, women basically were

                 limited to the kitchen and the bedroom, there to

                 nuture their children and service their husbands.

                 They were not allowed, for the most part, equal

                 opportunity in education.  They were not allowed,

                 for the most part, equal opportunity in jobs.

                 And they were subject, constantly, to the risk of

                 death and certain degradation if they needed to

                 terminate a pregnancy.
<p>

                            Was that a moral time?
<p>

                            Even contraceptives were not freely

                 available.  It was not, I remind you, until 1965,

                 when the Supreme Court struck down a law that

                 prohibited married couples from obtaining

                 contraceptives.  1965.  All women were excluded

                 from the benefits of citizenship because of that.

                 Was that a moral time?
<p>

                            All women benefited by those changes,

                 including conservative women, who may today think

                 that they oppose them.  Was it more moral in the

                 1950s when those limitations existed?
<p>

                            Gay men and lesbians in the 1950s lived secret lives of terror, desperate to avoid

                 revelation.  Their most intimate personal

                 relationships criminalized.
<p>

                            Disabled people were almost as well

                 hidden, closeted away, removed from

                 opportunities.  Disabled more by the social and

                 economic restrictions upon them than by their

                 physical afflictions.  Was that a more moral time

                 than today?  I don't think so.
<p>

                            And free speech, it is useful to

                 remember, was not all that free in the fifties

                 either.  It was a time of loyalty oaths.  It was

                 a time when people lost jobs for attending the

                 wrong meetings or dating the wrong people.
<p>

                            It was a time when the Attorney

                 General kept a long list of subversive

                 organizations.  It was a time when infiltration

                 and surveillance by the FBI, of anybody and any

                 organization and any political point of view that

                 J. Edgar Hoover didn't like, was rampant, and

                 endemic and unchecked and unchallenged.  It was a

                 time when congressional committees regularly

                 called people of this country to account for

                 their own political beliefs and associations, and to rat on their friends.
<p>

                            Was that a time of morality?  Was that

                 the kind of public virtue, civic virtue that is

                 to be celebrated?
<p>

                            And yet, the merchants of virtue today

                 are here to tell us that they loved the fifties.

                 The fifties were a time of white bread and soft

                 lyrics.  The fifties were a time of nice movies

                 about family life, Ozzie and Harriet.  Blue

                 Velvet, maybe, is more likely.
<p>

                            Because beneath, beneath all that

                 sweetness and beneath all those bucolic suburbs,

                 there was the cancer and the sore of deep civic

                 immorality and injustice.
<p>

                            Well, the sixties changed a lot of

                 that.  Not all of it, but a lot of it.  We

                 dismantled Jim Crow laws, a monumental

                 achievement.
<p>

                            Two weeks ago, I spent a weekend in

                 Jackson, Mississippi for a reunion, which you'll

                 hear more about later, of the Lawyers

                 Constitutional Defense Committee, the group that

                 began in 1964 that the ACLU adopted and nurtured

                 in 1965, 30 years ago.  That was a group that sent lawyers down south to Mississippi and

                 elsewhere to help the emerging civil rights

                 movement protest, to help them secure their legal

                 rights, to provide what little protection in

                 those places, that the law could provide.
<p>

                            It was an inspiring weekend.  You know

                 why?  Because what they faced 30 years ago was

                 more oppressive, more suffocating, more hopeless

                 than anything that we face today.
<p>

                            None of them thought that we would

                 prevail.  All of them risked death.  They went

                 there a year after Chaney and Schwerner and

                 Goodman were murdered for registering people to

                 vote and found in a ditch.
<p>

                            Two years after James Meredith was

                 shot for trying to enroll as a student in the

                 University of Mississippi.  And when we were

                 there two weekends ago, the face of Mississippi

                 had changed against all those odds.  And now, in

                 a place where James Meredith was shot for

                 enrolling in the University of Mississippi, the

                 new dean of the University of Mississippi Law

                 School was black.
<p>

                            [APPLAUSE]
<p>
		That was only the second most amazing

                 thing about him.  The first amazing thing was

                 that he attended the ACLU of Mississippi dinner

                 that night as a welcomed guest.
<p>

                            [LAUGHTER]
<p>

                            The fact is, is that these moral

                 issues in the sixties -- and they were not only

                 the dismantling of Jim Crow laws, as you know.

                 That period of time witnessed a virtual explosion

                 of rights.
<p>

                            What happened in the sixties was that

                 every group of people who had  been shut out of

                 equal citizenship in this country began to ask a

                 very radical, moral question, and that is:  Am I

                 a person too?  Does the Bill of Rights apply to

                 me?
<p>

                            And those questions began to feed into

                 the courts and into the Congress, and into the

                 forums of public opinion.  And more and more the

                 answer came back:  Yes.
<p>

                            And by the end of that decade and into

                 the early seventies, there had been an

                 exponential rise in the realization of rights and

                 equal justice, of a kind that was unimaginible only decades before.
<p>

                            Were we a more moral nation before

                 that revolution?  I don't think so.
<p>

                            Now, it's important to remember, as we

                 always tell ourselves, but must tell ourselves

                 again, repeatedly.  Andre Gide once said, you

                 know, that everything that needs to be said has

                 already been said.  But since nobody was

                 listening or remembering, everything needs to be

                 said again.
<p>

                            For those of you who think that I

                 sometimes go on too long, that is the leitmotif

                 of my life.
<p>

                            [APPLAUSE]
<p>

                            When you're preaching, you know, you

                 can never repeat yourself too often.
<p>

                            But the fact is, is that if we see the

                 Bill of Rights as a moral document, and we assess

                 the Bill of Rights and the American Civil

                 Liberties Union today, we are a little more than

                 200 years into the history of the Bill of Rights.

                 And we are 75 years into the history of the ACLU

                 today, and it is the right time to do an

                 assessment, especially since we are facing such a
	   reactionary attempt to roll back a lot of our

                 victories, and this is the right moment for a

                 mutual assessment.
<p>

                            It is important to remember, again,

                 that the Bill of Rights was a great document when

                 it was enacted in 1791, but it was also a flawed

                 document, and it didn't work.  It was a flawed

                 document because it left out African Americans

                 entirely, as well as American Indians, neither of

                 whom were considered to be human.  It was a

                 flawed document because it left out women, who

                 were considered human, but human property of a

                 sort.  They didn't even have the right to vote.

                 What equal citizenship?  What morality?
<p>

                            And the Bill of Rights didn't work

                 real well for anybody else, either.  In 1920,

                 when the ACLU was created, 130 years after the

                 Bill of Rights was adopted, two thirds of our

                 bicentennial period, the Bill of Rights hardly

                 worked at all.  Not only was racial segregation

                 still firmly cemented into the laws of this

                 country in a way nobody thought could be changed,

                 but women still didn't have the right to vote.

                 They didn't get that until later that year, after 70 years of struggle.
<p>

                            The separation of church and state was

                 there on paper, but there weren't too many

                 schools in this country that didn't impose

                 majoritarian prayer, against traditional family

                 values, against the notion that the family has

                 the prerogative for deciding the religious

                 upbringing of their children, not the government.

                 That principle was violated every day in

                 thousands of places in this country in 1920.
<p>

                            And in free speech, people were busted

                 all the time for meetings, for distributing

                 leaflets, for organizing labor unions.  Thousands

                 of people, during the protest against America's

                 entrance into World War I, were arrested for

                 protesting.  Books were prosecuted.  People were

                 put into jail for publishing pamphlets.  The

                 foreign born were deported in the dead of night.
<p>

                            In 1920, when the ACLU was created,

                 the Supreme Court had never, never struck down a

                 single statute or governmental act on First

                 Amendment grounds.  Two thirds of our

                 bicentennial history.
<p>

                            In 1925 John Scopes was tried as a criminal for teaching evolution in the schools of

                 Dayton, Tennessee.  And in 1924 Congress passed a

                 racist act of immigration called the National

                 Origins Exclusion Act.  I don't think that was

                 its exact name, but that certainly was its exact

                 intention and its effect, which barred people

                 from immigrating into this country, pretty much

                 except for Northwestern Europe.  That was a

                 reaction to the racist reaction to the floods of

                 immigration in the late 19th and early 20th

                 Century.  And it was not undone until 1965 when a

                 new immigration act passed at the height of the

                 civil rights movement, passed in the same year

                 that the Voting Rights Act was passed, undid

                 those racial and national origin exclusions and,

                 we are today fighting reaction to that 1965 civil

                 rights act.
<p>

                            So 1920, when the ACLU was created,

                 was a time when the Bill of Rights still wasn't

                 working.  Much of it was nice on paper, but it

                 didn't actually work the way Madison and

                 Jefferson intended.
<p>

                            Well, the ACLU did something about

                 that.  And so did the NAACP, and so did the labor unions.  They provided organized support for the

                 victims of the violation of rights, when the

                 victims themselves did not have the resources or

                 capacity to even get into court.  They provided

                 organizational resources and power at a time when

                 they didn't have much themselves.  The ACLU

                 started with 30 or 40 people in a room in

                 New York.  The NAACP with fewer.
<p>

                            We were not ever in the halls of

                 power.  You know, at a conference like this,

                 recently of the Christian Coalition, to announce

                 their new Contract With The Family or against the

                 family or something like that, or on the family.

                 Ralph Reed, the sweet-voiced, baby-faced Trojan

                 Horse in which Pat Robertson rides --
<p>

                            [APPLAUSE]
<p>

                            -- was up at the lectern, and he was

                 flanked, not with the members of the  ACLU

                 biennial conference committee -- an exercise in

                 raw power that should frighten the pants off the

                 government -- he was flanked by every major

                 leader in Congress.
<p>

                            Some of you may ask, where are they?

                 How come we're not flanked by every major leader in Congress?
<p>

                            Well, you know, worry not, we never

                 have been.  They were not there in 1920 when we

                 announced our formation.  They were not there

                 throughout the thirties.  They were not there in

                 1942 when we fought against the internment of

                 Japanese American citizens.  They were not there

                 in 1950 when we fought against loyalty oaths and

                 McCarthyism.  They have never been there.
<p>

                            They are called congressional leaders,

                 but the truth is they are followers.  They follow

                 the force of movements.
<p>

                            And the movements that have prevailed

                 have never had power on their side.  They have

                 spoke truth to power; they have spoke justice to

                 power; they have spoken fairness to power.  Their

                 strength has always been moral; their strength

                 has never been political.
<p>

                            So today, when we face the sort of

                 overwhelming problems that we face, it is

                 important to remember that we are more strong,

                 more numerous, richer, more powerful, more

                 influential, more well thought of, even by the

                 average American than we have ever been in our history.  And yet, we are outnumbered by the

                 others, and outpowered by our opponents in

                 government.
<p>

                            So what?
<p>

                            It's ever been thus.  It didn't seem

                 to faze the folks that went down to Mississippi

                 in 1965.  God knows they had more power arrayed

                 against them and less chance to beat it than we

                 do today, but they prevailed.  And 30 years later

                 Jackson, Mississippi is a different place and it

                 will never be the same again.
<p>

                            Most of us, most of our goals, most of

                 our moral goals have prevailed.  We are a freer

                 nation, a more libertarian nation, a more equal

                 nation than we have ever been in our history.

                 Certainly, more than we were when we started in

                 1920, but also more than we were in 1950 and,

                 yes, more than we were in 1960.
<p>

                            Now, we are professional

                 gloom-and-doomsayers.  We are always looking, as

                 we must, not on the progress we've made, but on

                 the progress we have yet to make; not on the road

                 we have traveled and the ground we have gained,

                 but on the road we have yet to travel and the ground that still has to be gained before these

                 moral principles are firm and entrenched and

                 irreversible.
<p>

                            So we are always looking at what is

                 undone and always bemoaning the defeats, but that

                 is our strength.  But it is important once in a

                 while not to get too depressed over what we have

                 not done and over our momentary defeats.  It is

                 important once in a while to realize how far we

                 have come and how far ahead in this game we are,

                 and that we are winning, by far.
<p>

                            [APPLAUSE]
<p>

                            I'm not whistling in the dark.

                 Measure all of those indices of civic virtue, of

                 public morality that I was talking about, and

                 tell me if we are not far, far better today than

                 we were at any prior point in our history.  And

                 that is why our opponents are so damn angry, that

                 is what they are upset about, that is what the

                 merchants of virtue are trying to undue.
<p>

                            Now, the real interesting question is:

                 If so many people benefit by all these rights,

                 why is there so much public receptivity to what I

                 believe is not a conservative movement, but a  reactionary one.  A movement that quite literally

                 is reacting to the victories of the sixties and

                 the exponential growth in rights and in equal

                 justice.
<p>

                            You know, it wasn't just blacks and

                 women and advocates of free speech and gay men

                 and lesbians.  It was every kind of movement that

                 drew inspiration from what happened in the late

                 fifties and the sixties.  It was, as I've said,

                 the disabled.  It was also mental patients, and

                 prisoners and people on welfare and children in

                 foster care.  It was the soldiers in the military

                 who also asked questions, like does the Bill of

                 Rights apply to me?  And can I be courtmartialed

                 for disagreeing on a matter of public policy?
<p>

                            People got tremendous inspiration from

                 Brown against Board of Education, because this

                 was not only about racial subjugation, it raised

                 the fundamental question and caused people to

                 start thinking about their own situation and it

                 produced copycat movements of rights.  Most of

                 the organizations you are familiar with today

                 didn't exist in 1950 or even in 1960.  Run down

                 the list in your mind of most of the civic organizations, the public interest organizations

                 that you know about today.  And you will find

                 that they did not exist before 1960.  And they

                 all came into being in order to champion the

                 rights of someone who had been excluded from

                 equal citizenship.
<p>

                            I remember, even the the early

                 beginnings, we're familiar with some of them,

                 we're familiar with the early beginnings of the

                 gay rights movement at Stonewall, but there are

                 others in hidden corners.  People began to get

                 hope from the movements and the progress of

                 others, particularly of black Americans.
<p>

                            In the late sixties or early seventies

                 in Syracuse a poster went up by a small group of

                 disabled people.  The poster was made to look

                 like an old March of Dimes poster, which had been

                 prevalent throughout the fifties, when polio was

                 still a major problem in this country.
<p>

                            And the poster said:  You gave us your

                 dimes, now we want our rights.
<p>

                            It was the beginning of the disability

                 rights movement, or at least the first beginning

                 that I saw.  And it wasn't:  You gave us our
                 dimes, now give us our rights.  It was:  You gave

                 us your dimes, now we want our rights.
<p>

                            Rights have always been subject to

                 demand, because nobody gives them away.  There is

                 no fire sale on rights.  Rights have to be taken,

                 always, and they have to be taken from power.
<p>

                            You can think of a right as a limit on

                 power, that's of course what the Bill of Rights

                 literally does.  But just think of it

                 intuitively:  If you have a right to vote by

                 secret ballot, it means that the government

                 doesn't have the power to look.  If you have the

                 right not to be denied a job because you are a

                 women or black or gay or Jewish, it means that

                 somebody doesn't have the power to prevent you.

                 If you have the right to speak on the street or

                 be secure in your home without fear of government

                 intrusion, it means that that right is the

                 equivalent of:  The government doesn't have the

                 power to stop you or punish you for it.
<p>

                            Every right is a limitation on power.

                 When the labor unions organized to form labor

                 unions and extract contractual rights from

                 factory owners, they did so by limiting the
                 discretionary owner of factory owners.  Every

                 right limits somebody's power and that is why

                 it's always a struggle.
<p>

                            Now, the explosion of rights from the

                 sixties, therefore was also an explosion of the

                 limitations of discretionary power that people

                 enjoyed, and they don't like it.  They don't like

                 it.  And they began right away to organize

                 opposition.  And that opposition has been what we

                 have been fighting.  And now, it is fair to say,

                 they have gained a little ground on us.  They

                 have set us back a bit.  Progress is never

                 linear.  It doesn't go by percentage growth.

                 Even percentage growth doesn't go by percentage

                 growth.
<p>

                            There are averages, to be sure, but it

                 doesn't mean every year you gain 5 percent.  Some

                 years you lose.  What counts is what happens over

                 the long term.
<p>

                            But anyone who is depressed because we

                 happen to be having a little downturn in the

                 stock market cycle of civil liberties, doesn't

                 understand the cycle.  Linear progress never goes

                 on.
<p>

                            We are now in a dangerous period.

                 There is very good reason to be alarmed, because

                 progress is not automatic.  We just can't pass a

                 resolution about how much we've achieved and

                 assume we are going to continue to achieve it or

                 even protect what we've achieved, just by being

                 there.  It is not automatic.  It is always a

                 struggle.  If liberty can be seen metaphorically

                 as a road that's hacked through a jungle of

                 power, remember that the jungle always, if it's

                 unattended, retakes the road.
<p>

                            You've got to keep hacking away.  And

                 the fact is that that jungle is beginning to edge

                 us out a little bit and narrow and constrict

                 those arteries of liberty.  There is very good

                 reason to be very alarmed now at what is

                 happening in this country.  But there is no

                 reason to be depressed or discouraged.  There

                 really isn't.
<p>

                            If Frederick Douglass wasn't depressed

                 in 1857 when the Dred Scott decision came down,

                 why should you be?
<p>

                            If Homer Plessy, a hundred years ago,

                 boarded that segregated train in Louisiana for a
        ride he knew would not do him well, and he was

                 not too discouraged to do it, why should you be?
<p>

                            If Rosa Parks sat down that tired day

                 in December of 1955, on the bus, and a young,

                 then unknown Baptist minister named Martin Luther

                 King Jr. stood up the next day to support her and

                 organized the Montgomery bus boycott, if they

                 weren't too tired and depressed, why should we

                 be?
<p>

                            They faced much worse than we face and

                 they faced it with much less than we have.  If

                 they were not discouraged, there is no reason for

                 us to be discouraged.  If they had hope and saw

                 that hope through and lived to see the day when

                 they prevailed, so shall we.  We always have,

                 that is the significance of our 75-year history.
<p>

                            Now, I want to end on a sports

                 metaphor, because I do hope to move this

                 organization somewhere into the mass, real world,

                 before I'm done.  And I want to go further.  I

                 want to even use a football metaphor.

<p>

                            Just think, there is reason to be

                 alarmed.  The forces of PC are ever among us.  I

                 want to talk about something -- get ready for

                 this, hold onto your seats -- that Vince Lombardi

                 once said.
<p>

                            [GROANS]
<p>

                            Look, America is watching this, don't

                 groan.  This is football we're talking about.

                 Vince Lombardi was not only a legendary football

                 coach, he also came from Brooklyn.
<p>

                            [APPLAUSE]
<p>

                            And he once said, at a testimonial

                 dinner given to him near the end of his career,

                 he said:  You know, I never lost a football game.

                 Once in a while time ran out.
<p>

                            Well, in our game, time never runs

                 out.  It's a permanent game.  We are not at their

                 goal line, but we will get there.  And the

                 significant thing to remember is that we are a

                 hell of a lot closer to their goal line today

                 than we were 20 years ago, 40 years ago, 60 years

                 ago.  And a hell of a lot closer to their goal

                 line than they are to ours.
<p>

                            [APPLAUSE]
<p>

                            So, what counts in these struggles, we

                 have learned over and over and over again, is
                 never how much power they have or what they do.

                 What counts is how much resistance we offer and

                 what we do in response.  The tide of liberty and

                 individual rights and equal justice is clearly

                 with us, but only if we keep swimming.
<p>

                            Thank you.
<p>

<center><h1>Transcript of Substantive Plenary III<br>
 Gender Equality</center></h1>
<blockquote>
      MS. MAHONEY:  We have a very impressive
    panel today, as you can see and have heard.  I
    don't want to take up too much of their time.
<p>
               I wanted to start by, like some other
    people today, talking about where we came from.  I
    don't want to go back in time quite as far as Katie
    did.  But instead, I thought I'd go back to 1964,
    an important year for me, because that was the year
    I graduated from college.  And, as some of you may
   remember, luckily some of you in this room don't,
   in 1964 there were still separate ads in the
   newspaper for women's jobs and men's jobs.  The
   men's jobs often, if not usually, were advertised
   with yearly, annual salaries.  The women's jobs had
   weekly salaries.
<p>

              I had graduated from the University of
   Chicago with a degree in history.  And I had a
   friend who worked for an employment agency, and she
   asked the person who ran the agency if they would
   be able to find me a job.  And her boss's response
   was:  Does she type?
<p>

              I didn't, so I didn't get a job.
<p>

              A year later, having gotten tired of the
   only kinds of jobs I could get with my BA, I
   decided to go to graduate school.  When I applied
  to graduate school at the University of Chicago, I
    was told that although I could get in, I wouldn't
    get a fellowship because -- and this is pretty much
    a direct quote -- the University of Chicago history
    department doesn't give fellowships to women.
<p>

               One lucky thing about those years was
    that I did not encounter, I was not subject to an
    unplanned pregnancy, but I had a lot of friends who
    did.  And there were two real solutions open to
   women of my generation, when they had an unplanned
   pregnancy.  One was to marry, and we all remember
   the phrase -- but those of us, again, that know
   that era remember the phrase -- they had to get
   married.  So we used to talk about couples our age,
   when they then, five months later had premature
   eight pound babies.  Or, they had an illegal
   abortion.
<p>

              Again, we were lucky.  We were middle
   class.  We could usually raise enough money to go
   to somebody who was at least medically qualified.
   Granted, the abortions were done without
   anesthetics, under terrifying circumstances, in
   constant fear that the police would come in and
   arrest everybody.
<p>

              None of my friends died.  None of my
   friends, to the best of my knowledge, were rendered
    sterile by the procedures.  But all of my friends
    who underwent those procedures were traumatized by
    them.
<p>

               We thought, in 1964 and 1965, that if we
    could get formal equality, this would all change.
    And we thought, after a few years, we had achieved
    formal equality.
<p>

               Title VII, somewhat inadvertently
   included women as a protected class for employment
   discrimination purposes.  Title IX, on its face,
   prohibited the University of Chicago from at least
   overtly discriminating against women in graduate
   school fellowships.
<p>

              Roe Wade extended the opportunity to
   have legal abortions for women.  A series of
   Supreme Court cases mostly, thanks to the ACLU,
   included women as a semi-protected class for equal
   protection purposes.  And by 1975 we said, wow,
   this is it, this is great, you know.
<p>

              Well, that was what, 20 years ago.  And
   as Katie pointed out just before, women lawyers,
   even controlling for time off for children, et
   cetera, women lawyers don't make what men lawyers
   make.
<p>

               Roe Wade is still the law, but legal,
    safe abortion is functionally unavailable for many
    women in our society, because they cannot get to a
    provider or they can't afford the providers
    available to them or they have 24-hour waiting
    periods.
<p>

               Women who cannot find jobs and who have
    child-raising responsibilities make due on welfare,
    which has become a lower and lower amount, as
   compared to the cost of living over the last 20
   years.  And we now see more a tax on welfare, on
   unemployed women who are trying to raise families,
   on safe and legal abortion.  And I don't know if it
   is worse -- they're all bad -- and the entire
   system of affirmative action is under attack,
   nationally and in particular in California.
<p>

              And so I suppose I would like to start
   this panel with a question, which is, to ask the
   panelists to tell us more about where we've been,
   where we are, and with any luck at all, where we're
   going, with a little hope for the future.
<p>

              So I'm going to turn it over to Sylvia
   Law now.
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

             MS. LAW:  Thanks.  It's a pleasure to be
   here.
<p>

               In the early 1970s the Supreme Court
    transformed the constitutional understanding of
    gender equality in a movement that is, I think, as
    dramatic as we ever have observed in our history of
    the Constitution.  The ACLU Women's Rights Project,
    under the leadership of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was
    instrumental in achieving this change in
    constitutional understanding and reversing this
   transformation.  The ACLU deserved a lot of credit
   for this.
<p>

              In 1973 when Justice Ginsburg urged the
   Court to treat gender-based classifications like
   those based on race, as constitutionally suspect,
   the prevailing law in 1973 still included those
   famous sexist decisions like Bradwell v. Illinois,
   Muller v. Oregon, and Hoyt v. Florida.
<p>

              Hoyt was decided in 1961.  It upheld a
   Florida statute that effectively excluded women
  from the jury pool, Gwendolyn Hoyt, the defendant
   in that case was charged with murdering her abusive
   husband.  She pled self defense.  There were no
   women on her jury and her lawyer said, this is
   unfair, to exclude women from a jury, the jury in a
   case like this.
<p>

             The court rejected her claim, stating
    that, "a woman is still regarded as the center of
    the home and family life and hence cannot be
    expected to serve on a jury."  That was 1961.
<p>

               Justice Ginsburg's 1973 brief discussed
    these cases under the wonderful lawyerly,
    consummately understated banner:  Precedent and
    need of reevaluation.  And her arguments
    prevailed.  And with a few notable exceptions, like
   the military, explicit gender based classifications
   are today presumptively unconstitutional.
<p>

              Despite this spectacular change in
   constitutional understanding, gender equality has
   not been achieved, why is that?  The ACLU and other
   women's rights advocates have suffered three major
   defeats in our efforts to establish gender equality
   as a constitutional norm.
<p>

              First, the Court has rejected the notion
   that discriminatory effects, however stark, however
   unjustified, can form the basis for finding a state
   policy unconstitutional.  Rather, the Court demands
   that people seeking equal treatment under the law
   show that the state intended to hurt them.  As open
   racism and open sexism have become culturally and
   constitutionally unacceptable, intent is virtually
   impossible to prove.
<p>

               In the area of employment, neutral
    policies for the discriminatory impact can be
    challenged under Title VII and those disparate
    impact rules have proven to be workable and have
    been effective in drawing diverse skills and
    talents into the workplace.  Not so under the
    Constitution.
<p>

               The second significant defeat for the
   proponents of meaningful constitutional guarantees
   of gender equality is the Court's holding that
   discrimination against pregnant people has nothing
   to do with gender.  Now, this is a conclusion that
   only a lawyer can reach --
<p>

              [ LAUGHTER ].
<p>

              -- and even most lawyers and judges
   find incomprehensible.  It has profound impact in
   immunizing discrimination against pregnant women
   from regular constitutional scrutiny.
<p>

              Third, despite the best efforts of the
   ACLU and others, the Court has sometimes endorsed
   the notion that government can buy up
   constitutional liberty and equality.  Medicaid pays
   for all medically necessary services except for
   those women who determine to have an abortion; the
   clinics and doctors can receive funds for
    contraceptive services only if they comply with the
    government gag rule prohibiting them from using the
    A word.  And now the Republican Congress seeks to
    punish the children of poor women, by denying aid
    to women who reject abortion and have the child.
   They lose either way.
<p>

               The net result is that while our
    constitutional commitment to gender equality is
   affirmed in the abstract, it's denied in concrete
   reality.  To put it another way, a slightly
   different spin on it, gender equality often seems
   to deliver greater benefits to men than to women,
   to the women who were and are kept down by a
   patriarchal culture law.
<p>

              Let me offer two examples of this
   phenomena.  First in Mississippi University v.
   Hogan, the Court upheld a gender equality claim of
   a man who wanted to go to an all-female nursing
   school.  Mississippi offered men a lot of
   opportunities to go to nursing school, but this guy
   wanted to go to a school right next to his home and
   happened to get the ACLU defending his claim.  The
   Court held that Hogan should not be further put to
   the inconvenience of travel, simply because he was
    a man.  That result seems right to me.
<p>

               But how do we understand then, the fact
    that Shannon Faulkner is having such a difficult
    time getting into The Citadel, the only school in
    her state that offers people the opportunity to go
    to a military academy.  How do we understand then,
    the fact that the Court upholds laws telling
    pregnant women that they have to travel great
    distances, endure bias counseling, wait for a risk
   enhancing interval, before they can obtain an
   abortion.  Why are we willing to put women to this
   inconvenience, but unwilling to put men to
   comparable inconvenience?
<p>

             The law of child support offers another
   example of how gender equality has come to benefit
   men at the expense of women.  Until recently, child
   support laws typically required parents to support
   boys until the age of 21 and girls until the age of
   18.  The theory was that boys needed to be
   supported so that they could go to school and get
   educated.  In Stanton v. Stanton, the Court held,
   Justice Brennan said, "No longer is the female
   destined for the home and only the male for the
   marketplace of the world of ideas.  The specified
   age of majority is required for the boy in order to
   assure him parental support while he obtains his
    education, so too, is it for the girl."
<p>

               Justice Brennan obviously contemplated
    that both boys and girls would be enabled to go to
    school, that is not how it's turned out.  To comply
    with the demand of equality, what states have done,
    is lowered the age of support for everyone.  So
    that the custodial parent, typically the father,
    more separated from the family, declines to
   support, and the mothers, typically who have
   custody after divorce, struggle to enable their
   children, male and female, to go to college.  Dads
   are legally off the hook in the name of equality.
<p>

              Gender equality should be a benefit to
   both men and women, however, it seems that our
   struggle for equality has succeeded best when it
   benefits men as well as women or only men, and has
   failed in many significant ways for women.
<p>

              In discussing the Court's recent
   affirmative action decision, Linda Greenhouse, from
   The New York Times, observes that while the Court
   sometimes is out in front of public opinion, as in
   Brown v. Board of Ed, and sometimes is an
   impediment to progressive change, as in the Lochner
   era, that often the Court is in sync with the
    culture.  And she argues that that is the case with
    respect to the affirmative action decisions.
    Similarly, I think that the Court's gender equality
    cases reflected a general cultural acceptance of
    formal gender equality.
<p>

               And that the Court's failures with
    respect to women who are poor, women who are
    pregnant, or the failure to take seriously the
    notion that equality is about effects, not simply
   formal rules, both reflects and reinforces more
   general cultural attitudes.
<p>

              Thus the challenge for us as civil
   libertarians and feminists is to transform the
   culture, much more difficult than writing a brief.
   Gender equality requires that we obtain respect for
   the poor as well as the rich, the pregnant woman
   and mother as well as the female CEO.
<p>

              Thank you.
<p>

              MS. MAHONEY:  Our next speaker is Faye
   Wattleton.
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

              MS. WATTLETON:  On January 23rd, 1917,
   The New York Times, on page 20, had a byline that
   read "Mrs. Byrne must go to workhouse."  A few days
   later, "Mrs. Byrne fasts in the workhouse cell, but
   Commissioner Lewis promises she'll eat when
    necessary.  She spurns a bath, too."
<p>

               A few days later, "Mrs. Byrne now fed by
    force.  Birth control prisoner near collapse,
    revives after food is administered.  Offered no
    resistance.  But Mrs. Sanger hears her sister was
    in a state of coma as a result of of the hunger
    strike."
<p>

               On January 29th, The New York Times
   reported, "Can't coax Mrs. Byrne to eat."  And of
   Sanger's trial, it was said that "Mrs. Sanger
   defies court before 3,000 women who cheer her
   speech."
<p>

              When I read that account of the various
   chronicles, in The New York Times, of the struggle
   between Margaret Sanger and her sister, who were
   engaged in perhaps the most important movement
   toward women's equality of the century -- and I
   speak with high regard for the right of women to
   vote, but I do believe that the right of women to
   control our most personal bodies and our
   reproductive decisions, most fundamental -- it
   reminds me of the continuing struggle for equality
   with respect to gender and reproductive rights.
<p>

              I think this is a time that we must
    examine whether this will be a place in our
    history, in which we have challenged successfully
    the forces of those who would imprison women once
    again, even to defy those forces, and to advance to
    our potential.  Our willingness to be a resonance
    of demagoguery, exclusion and repression, you
    certainly heard in the previous speaker.
<p>

               The threats that still do loom, it is
    really a time in which shocking examples of
   extremism that turn on religious beliefs and that
   require those beliefs to be translated into
   political commands have gained a currency in the
   political process and in the public policymaking
   mechanism that ought to alarm every American,
   regardless of our political persuasions.
<p>

              The fear and the anger that is reflected
   in the believers of the restoration of the status
   quo, whatever that may be, and the characterization
   of their battle as restoring the basic tenants upon
   which this country was founded, are a real
   challenge to us.  The meaning of the Bill of
   Rights, and that 200 years later women do not enjoy
   all of the protections of those rights.
<p>

              Ironically, the rights of women are wont
   to be at the center of our most contentious public
    policy debates.  Whether they are cloaked in the
    rhetoric of welfare reform or health care reform,
    it doesn't matter.  If we don't take responsibility
    for an investment in these debates, women will lose
    even more ground in our continuing quest for
    equality.  Because true equality for women resides
    on very basic principles that are important and
    inherently characteristic to our democracy, the
    principles, the tenants of religious liberty,
   freedom of expression, due process and all the
   other guarantees that Americans, that is American
   men, take for granted.  And should not be as at the
   subject of the whims of partisan politics.
<p>

              What do I mean about the need for us to
   remember the immediate past battles, as in forming
   the debates and the challenges ahead?  Well, with
  respect to reproductive rights, and I do believe
   that women's rights and women's reproductive
   equality will continue to be at the center of these
   debates, there is every evidence that they will be
   so.
<p>

              I think we have some very sobering
   lessons out of the Bush-Reagan, or the Reagan-Bush
  years.
<p>

              Let us not forget that the imposition of
    censorship on family planning clinics was not
    implemented, not because the courts struck down the
    President's right to impose such restrictions, but
    because they were not implemented due to a
    technical finding in the Court's decision.
<p>

               Let us not forget that the requirement
    to withhold information from women in Title X
    clinics has not been implemented simply because
    President Clinton has chosen not to do so.  But
   that we now have a Congress that enjoys the
   majority, that has made it as one of its central
   platform issues to restore censorship against women
   in family planning clinics.
<p>

              We must not forget the battles of the
   past in Ray versus Alexandria Reproductive Health
   Services, in which our federal government consorted
   with terrorists to deny women equal access to
   reproductive health clinics -- these were
   individuals engaged in attempting to blockade
   access to clinics -- and in trampling on the
  constitutional right to free association and
   freedom of speech and freedom of choice.  In this
   case we now see the implementation of a law that
   would deny a woman the right to freely make a
   decision about her reproduction and to exercise
   that right at her discretion, and without the state
    intervening in the process of that decision.
    Teenage women continue to be especially vulnerable
    and they are especially vulnerable in the case of
    the welfare reform debate.
<p>

               Now, there are a few within our society,
    even among teenagers, I would suspect, who would
    consider bringing a child into the world as an
    unimportant act.  I know that the popular theory is
   that children want to have children, because they
   think it's a great idea.  But the evidence simply
   does not substantiate that conventional wisdom.
<p>

              And nevertheless, we are seeing now,
   that teenagers are being held up as the blame for
   all that is wrong with our society, and the cause
   of welfare being out of control, and the need to
   somehow corral their hormones and their bodies, to
  prevent this egregious offense against society from
   going unchecked, it would seem.
<p>

              It is unlikely, with great cogitation,
   that we cannot imagine a government policy in which
   two people engaged in sexual intercourse would, in
   fact, attempt to impose upon them, to think about
   the legal consequences of welfare policy upon their
   act.
<p>

              Equally, the act of avoiding pregnancy,
    as an overwhelming number of women in this country,
    even poor women in this country attempt to do, are
    not subject to simple pronouncements.  To those
    that are subject to welfare reform, to simply say:
    If you get pregnant you will, if by happenstance
    you become pregnant, you simply will not enjoy
    equal access to health care services and to a
    decent life for you and your child.
<p>

              A lot of factors are involved in all of
   our sexuality.  Many complex issues, both among the
   poor and the affluent in this country -- and none
   of us are exempt -- integrate into the process of
   reproductive decisions, pregnancy, termination and
   childbirth.
<p>

              It makes no sense to discuss cutting off
   benefits to the poor, at the same time that we have
   not only not kept pace with providing reproductive
  health services to the poor, but we have seen our
   federal government and our Congress engage in an
   unrelenting attack on the poor's access to
   reproductive health services broadly.
<p>

              It makes no sense to attack single
 mothers.  I'm reminded, by the way, that Bob Dole
   and Newt Gingrich made their former wives single
  mothers.
<p>

               [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

               It seems to me the issue, therefore, is
    not whether you are single, but who is single.  And
    what is the moral standard, is it different by race
    and by class?
<p>

               This is the essence of this great
    debate.  Broadly labeling single-parent families as
    dysfunctional and two-parent families as healthy,
   seems to me to also be a very high disregard for
   reality.
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

             I believe that major reform will take
   place when this country and the conscience of this
   country is called to give evidence that at the
   center of this debate continues to be women's
   equality and our aspirations to truly be equal,
   whether it is for reproductive equality, health
   equality or welfare equality.  The loss of the
   so-called health care reform debate was a missed
  opportunity to make women's access to health care
   truly equal.
<p>

             And the issue of welfare reform is,
  indeed, about gender equality.  The impending
 debate on welfare reform will certainly focus on
 unwed mothers and teenagers, but it will not
    refocus on what it will take to make their lives
    and their opportunities truly equal.
<p>

               In addition, we know already that the
    reformers will assume that the denial of health
    care benefits will somehow alter our libido and
    that somehow sexuality and child bearing will be
    checked by the punitive nature of their policies.
    There is no evidence in human history that this
   policy will work.  We can only see it for what it
   is:  An outrageous and angry assault on women.
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

              The Chinese, it is said, wish their
   friends to live in interesting times.  Well, I
  think these are interesting times, friends or foe.
   I prefer to see them, however, as great
   opportunities in which we test the strength of this
   great nation and our resolve to our democracy.
   That means that while women's equality in all of
   these debates, and these are major and pivotal,
   indeed, seminal debates for the future of our
   nation, continue to be forged and defended in the
   courts, and engagement in public policy and in the
  full participation of women in the political
   process must be at the top of all of our agendas,
regardless of our place and our station in life.
<p>

               It is estimated that based on the
    current rate of women's entry into politics, it
    will take 410 years for us to reach parity in the
    Congress alone.  That is simply unacceptable.
<p>

               Whether we praise Pat Robertson or
    Mr. Reed, we must not be blinded by the dangerous
    ruthlessness and the disregard for the civil
    liberties of women and the religious fervor
   shrouding the tactics of those who want to destroy
   our right to freedom of association, freedom of
   speech and freedom of religion, nor the tactics of
   government leaders in their unprecedented and
   continuing efforts to oppress women.  Time must not
   dull our sensitivities on the real and present
  danger that our great nation faces, regardless of
   our gender or of our station in life.
<p>

              We are facing these dilemmas, but we
   must take great courage, and I know that you do, as
   members and associates of the ACLU.  But the work
   that you have done has made it possible for women
   to enjoy the equality that we now enjoy.
<p>

              In my former association, I am very
  mindful that the ACLU was very instrumental in
   making it possible for Margaret Sanger's birth
   control movement to be launched and for helping to
    keep her out of jail.  ACLU lawyers defended her.
<p>

               I am also reminded that at the end of
    her life Margaret Sanger expressed the desire that
    she be remembered for doing something to help
    women, because women are the future of this great
    nation.  And I believe that we must ask ourselves
    every day, and not rest on the progress, nor the
    contributions that we have made in the past, but
   ask ourselves with every new day that may we hope
   that our lives will indeed have done something to
   help women, because we are the future of this
   nation.
<p>

              Thank you.
<p>

             [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

              DR. ELDERS:  I want to tell you -- well,
   I need to tell you that I am really very pleased to
   be here, and on this distinguished panel with
   wonderful women, that I very much appreciate.
<p>

              The other thing is that I really want to
   thank the ACLU for inviting me to be a part of
   their national board.
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

              While I was sitting here this morning,
   one of our members reached over and they said,
  Dr. Elders, you finally found your home.
<p>

               And I want to tell you, you've made me
    really feel at home and I'm very grateful and very
    thankful.  And as I've said over and over, that
    I've always believed about the things and been
    about the things that the ACLU has been about, and
    I want to thank you for all the long years that
    you've worked hard to break down those barriers and
    start trying to build bridges over all of those
   rivers of racism, sexism, purposism, skepticism,
   homophobia, all those isms that we've got out
   there.  And we must work to try to build bridges
   over all of those rivers.
<p>

              But today I want to talk about some of
   those problems that are related to gender issues.
   We all know that if we want to save our society as
   we know it, we've got to control the three Ps, the
   three Ps are poverty, population and pollution.
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

              And we ask, who are the poorest members
   of our society?  Women and children.  The reason
   children are poor is because their mothers are
   poor.  So --
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

              -- so I think we have to begin to look
 at what's happening and how this is affecting all
    of our society.
<p>

               We know that in regard to population, we
    know that 80 percent of the children born to
    mothers who are unmarried and have not finished
    high school and are single, are poor.  Whereas only
    8 percent of those born to mothers who are married,
    who have already finished high school, only 8
    percent of those children are poor.
<p>

              So that says to us that we need to try
   and look at the problems that deal with these kinds
   of issues, if we are going to really make a
   difference in our whole society.  And we've got to
   look at what we need to do to fix those problems.
<p>

              As we also know, that when we talk about
   women, you know, even for those women like me --
   I'll use me as an example -- we know that there's a
   magic glass ceiling in regard to jobs, and not many
   of us get through that glass ceiling.
<p>

              [ LAUGHTER ].
<p>

              3 percent.  3 percent.
<p>

              And so that if you know that of only
   those women who are educated and have the know-how
   and the savvy, only 3 percent gets through, well,
   you know that that says that there is a real
  problem for those that don't.
<p>

               One of the things with myself, I want to
    tell you, you know, I loved being your Surgeon
    General.  And I'll tell you one other thing --
<p>

               [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

               Thank you.  Thank you.
<p>

               I did the very best job that I knew how
    to do.  And I want to tell you, if I had to do it
    all over again, on every thing I know, starting
   today, I would do it exactly the same way.
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

              DR. ELDERS:  I went to Washington to be
   the Surgeon General.  I didn't go to get a job.  I
   had a job.
<p>

              So with that, the other thing that I
   want to say, my leaving Washington, for me, was a
   bend in the road, not the end of the road.  I plan
   to continue to work for the things that I believed
   in when I went there, I believed in when I left,
   and I believe in today.
<p>

              And if my leaving were to fix those
   problems, heaven knows we'd all be thrilled to
   death.  But the problems of poverty, teenage
   pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse, violence, crime,
   all the things that I was really trying to fight
   against, are still problems that are going on in
    our society.  And I feel that we've got to make a
    difference, because we know they're most likely,
    most likely to impact women.
<p>

               We know in our society, 60 percent of
    the children born in America are unplanned.
    60 percent.  We have the resources, we have the
    know-how to make a difference, but we've not made
    the commitment to get it done.
<p>

              We have allowed those men in Washington
   to use women's uteruses to get elected, and it's
   high time --
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

              -- it's high time we stop letting them
   hide behind our uteruses to get elected.
<p>

              You know and I know that they aren't
   concerned about poor children.  All these rules and
   all of these laws they're making in regard to
   welfare, in regard to Medicaid, all of those rules,
   who do you think they're affecting?  They don't
   affect the women in this room.  If any of you
   wanted an abortion or wanted, you know,
   contraceptives, whatever, you know, you may have to
   do without a new coat this winter to get it, but
   you could get it.
<p>

            They affect the young, the poor, and the
    uneducated.  And we are going to try and make a
    difference.  We have got to be the power brokers
    for the powerless, if we are going to make a
    difference.
<p>

               [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

               I just want to mention, Faye mentioned,
    when we were talking about welfare reform, it's
    amazing, we are only one of two countries -- health
   care reform, excuse me -- who do not have health
   care, universal access to health care:  The United
   States and South Africa.
<p>

              We spend 14 percent of our gross
   domestic product on health care.  The problem is we
   don't spend it on health care, we spend it on very
   expensive sick care.  We spend less than 1 percent,
   less than 1 percent of our health care budget on
   keeping people healthy.
<p>

              You know those nice little things like
   immunizations, like prenatal care, you know, these
   are all women's issues.  How many men do you see
   going for prenatal care or family planning?  All of
   those are preventive health kinds of measures.
<p>

              Health education?  Of course not.  When
   I was up there saying:  We need to educate our
   people.  We've got a health illiterate society,
    what do you think they're saying?
<p>

               They're saying, oh, you know, let the
    parents do it.  Well, the parents don't do it, they
    don't know how, nobody ever taught the parents.
<p>

               We have a health illiterate society.  We
    have a society where 45 percent of our sixth
    graders say there is more fat in watermelon than
    there is in cheese.  So we put all these labels on
   food, but they don't know what they mean.  What
   good are they?
<p>

              We feel we don't want to educate our
   society, because if we educate our children we
   might teach them something about sex.
<p>

              Well, somebody needs to teach them
   something about sex.
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

             When you have the highest birth rate for
   teenage -- the highest birth rate, pregnancy rate
   and abortion rate to teens in the industrialized
   world.  When we find 60 percent of our children are
   unplanned, we have 12 million people with STD every
   year, 3 million of those are teenagers, when we
   find that we have 21 percent of our population with
   herpes virus, AIDS is increasing most rapidly in
  our adolescents.  You would think somebody needed
    to teach them something.
<p>

               You know what they tell me?  Well,
    Dr. Elders, if you tell them about it, they'll do
    it.
<p>

               But they're already doing it.
<p>

               I'm just saying:  They are really
    related to gender kinds of issues, because they
    disproportionately affect women.  And because of
   that, many young women are not able to go and get
   family planning services.  You know, can you
   believe we feel, well, we make Medicaid available
   if you're pregnant, but it's not available for
   family planning?
<p>

              As I told the group earlier, I told
   Representative Waxman, I said that the Medicaid
   system, the way it's designed, had to be designed
   by a white male slave owner who wanted to have
   healthy slaves, rather than have healthy, educated,
   motivated children with hope.
<p>

              And that's what we've got to be about.
   We need to prevent unplanned pregnancies, not look
   at it how welfare systems talk about how we aren't
   going to take care of them.
<p>

              If we put out good health care education
  systems in place, if we began to put good services
    for young people in place so they had access, well,
    I think then we can talk about reforming the
    welfare system.
<p>

               You see, you can't pay anybody enough to
    be poor.  And that's what our Congress seems to be
    thinking about.  I wonder -- you know, they need to
    rethink what they're really talking about and what
    they're doing.
<p>

              So what are some of the strategies that
   I've really been about and feel that we've got to
   do?  Many of you have heard me say many times, and
   everyone else:  That we need to try to make every
   child born in America a planned and wanted child.
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

              I'm not about abortions.  I've never
   been about abortions.  I support a women's right to
   choice.
<p>

              You see, I feel I don't know anybody who
   knows enough to decide for another women.  I don't
   know anybody who is good enough, even if they knew
   enough.  And lastly, we don't love enough to make
   that kind of decision.  It's a decision between a
   woman, her doctor, her significant other, and her
   God.  And it's not for the politicians in
 Washington to decide.
<p>

               [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

               So when we get those services and get
    them out there, why, then I feel that we've got to
    also, we feel so strongly about, you know, how we
    feel about children, and this is why, you know,
    I've made the statement.  And I mean it, and I'll
    make it again:  That I feel that the -- our very
    religious, non-Christian right have a love affair
   with the fetus.  If they didn't have a love affair
   with the fetus, they'd be out there fighting for
   programs for children.  Have you heard them
   fighting for welfare?  Have you seen them out there
   fighting for health care?
<p>

              Have you seen them out there fighting
   for early childhood education for all children?
   Maybe they do it in your state, they don't do it in
   mine.
<p>

              So I feel these are things that we have
   to be about if you're really for children.  You
   know, an affair is something that lasts a short
   time and you can walk out of it.  Anybody who has
   ever had children, I don't know when you get rid of
   them.  Mine are in their thirties and they're still
   around.  It goes on forever.
<p>

           And so you keep -- this is why I feel
    that we have to keep working on things of that
    sort.  You've got to make sure that we have early
    childhood education for all children, so they can
    get a good start.  And that means, if they get a
    good start, they're very likely to do well.  Only
    18 percent of Medicaid children have early
    childhood education.
<p>

               We've got to make sure that we have
   comprehensive health education programs in our
   schools from kindergarten through 12th grade.
<p>

              We've got to teach our young men to be
   responsible.  I know, I was really trying to put
   the Social Security card number of young males on
   the birth certificate, you know, and what they told
   me, why Dr. Elders, there is just no way we can get
   the money.
<p>

              I said, you can take money out of my
   check for Social Security, you take money out of my
   check every month for Medicare, why can't you take
   money for, you know, from a man's check to help pay
   for his child?
<p>

              One of the things when I talk to young
   men about the importance of being responsible, and
   when I mention that we're going to put their Social
 Security card number on the birth certificate and
    take 17 percent of their salary off the top, they
    may be asleep till I say that.  Once I make that
    statement:  What did you say, Dr. Elders?
<p>

               I'm saying, you make two parents
     responsible, not just one.
<p>

               [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

               And that means that we're really
    discriminating against women, because they're
   saying, well, it's unfair to the men.
<p>

              Well, what about being unfair to the
   women?  So I think that that's something that we
   really could do and we need to do and then we
   wouldn't have the problems of men running around
   bragging about how many children they have, none of
   whom they are taking care of.
<p>

              So what do I feel that the role of the
   ACLU is and what do I feel that we need to be
   doing?
<p>

              Well, first of all, I think you've been
   doing what you need to be doing.  We've got to be
   aware of the problem and it's obvious all of you
   are aware.  We've got to be strong advocates for
   these problems, for women's issues, and you have
   been strong advocates for a long time.  And we've
  got to develop action plans that work.  We've got
    to get together.
<p>

               We've been the world's greatest
    coalition builder, but I want to tell you, we've
    got to learn how to network and begin to go out and
    reach out to people that are not like us.
<p>

               The other thing I think we've got to do
    is, we've got to have courage.  I'll never forget
    the one thing that a woman from Alaska told me one
   time.  She said, Dr. Elders, always remember, one
   person with courage makes a majority.  And every
   time I get down and feel I can't go another step, I
   remember that.
<p>

              And you've got to be our leaders, we've
   got to be our leaders.  Leaders that are willing to
   lead, rather than leaders who go out and test which
   way the wind is blowing and jump out front.  We've
   got too many of those out there already.
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

              We've got to make sure that we lead.
              And last, but not least, for you and the
   ACLU, we've got to stick together and deal with
   unity.
<p>

              You know, there is that old saying that
   when spider webs unite, they can bring down the
    lion.  I think it is time for us to unite around
    the issues, and they don't have to be perfect, and
    let's come together.
<p>

               And I'll tell you something that my
    Bishop told me, that I carry with me all the time
    wherever I go.  In the church -- and I'll tell you
    what we're doing now, and that I'm willing to use
    my platform to run away, as I run around and talk,
    to do that -- he says, Dr. Elders, in the things
   that you are fighting about, it's like dancing with
   a bear.  He said, always remember when you're
   dancing with a bear, you can't get tired and sit
   down.  You have to wait until the bear gets
   tired --
<p>

              [ LAUGHTER ].
<p>

              -- and then you sit down.
<p>

              So...
<p>

              [ APPLAUSE ].
<p>

              So I'm here today to tell you that I'm
   trying to recruit new members to help dance with
   that bear so that we can all sit down.
<p>

              Thank you very much.
<p>

Separation of Church and State</CENTER></H1>
<blockquote>
<P>
MR. DORSEN: I think I should be prepared to say something witty
about the unexpected pleasure of seeing my old friends here after
so many years not on the podium. I will just say how pleased I
am to be back amongst you and to have an opportunity to participate
in this 75th anniversary biennial.
  <P>
 I am specifically pleased to have been asked to moderate this
particular panel, because it is the subject on which I have had
a long-standing interest, and as I understand it, each of the
moderators is asked to put the subject in some context.


<P>
And I would like to start with what I hope is not a quibble, and
that is, I don't think the title of Separation of Church and State
was the title that I would have chosen if I had looked over the
program in advance, the way I used to years ago.


<P>
The title should have been Religious Liberty, and that's for two
reasons. The first reason is that the First Amendment also protects
free expression of religion, and the ACLU has often supported
the rights of those whom the state has abridged.


<P>
Even more important, perhaps, it is essential that it be understood
that separation of church and state, also in the First Amendment,
is a means of protecting religious liberty by assuring that the
government does not improperly support one religion over another
or all religions over no religions. Separation of church and state
is not a technical concept, then, but one that goes deeply to
the safeguarding of liberty in this country.


<P>
Now, in trying to suggest a terse framework for this panel, my
mind rolled back to the 50th anniversary of the ACLU and specifically
The Book of Rights of Americans, in which there was an essay by
one of the great leaders in the church-state area, Dr. Leo Pfeffer,
and his first sentence in his essay in that book, written specifically
for the ACLU's 50th anniversary, was this: &quot;A fortuitous
combination of circumstances explains the launching of the experiment
expressed in 1787 in the promulgation for the new nation of a
secular constitution, limiting the powers and concerns of the
government to secular affairs, and reiterated four years later
in the Bill of Rights, whose opening words forbade the government
to establish religion or prohibit its free exercise.&quot;


<P>
Pfeffer, in his article, then proceeds to trace the generally
favorable trend of decisions, from 1940 to 1970, including the
cases in 1962 and 1963 that banned organized school prayer, and
the Everson case, in 1968, that struck down the law that prohibited
the teaching of Darwinian evolution. A few months after Pfeffer
wrote the essay, there was the Lemon case, which invalidated several
forms of government financial aid to religious schools.


<P>
Pfeffer also referred in his essay to the case in which the Supreme
Court held unconstitutional a Maryland law that barred from public
office persons who would not take an oath that they believed in
the existence of God.


<P>
Pfeffer then said the following: That decision, the one about
the oath to support the belief in God, coupled with the Seeger
decision, that decision held that conscientious objectors to the
Vietnam War could take the same privileges, even if they were
not religious, as religious conscientious objectors could, as
long as their philosophy bore the same relationship to their being
that religious people had with their philosophies.


<P>
Pfeffer then said that this would seem to point to a trend toward
equalization of religious and nonreligious conscience. Pfeffer
attributed this trend and indeed our secular society to several
causes, including the fact that many American colonists fled religious
persecution, to the ideas of The Enlightenment, notely John Locke
of England and Voltaire and others before the French Revolution,
and to the existence of a frontier in American life.


<P>
His article was upbeat, his article was optimistic. Well, that
was then and this is now, and since 1971, things have gone in
a very mixed way for us in the Supreme Court. Organized school
prayers are still unconstitutional, but a constitutional amendment
is pending which would reverse that. Moments of silence, sometimes
mere facades for religious prayer, are gaining acceptance. Religious
displays on public property, at Christmas and other times, have
been upheld. More forms of government dollars sent to religious
schools have been upheld.


<P>
More serious to us, I think, than the record in the courts is
the movement underground. It is fascinating to me, and unfortunate,
that in speaking of threats to the First Amendment in this area,
Leo Pfeffer referred to the Roman Catholic Church, he referred
to Orthodox Jews. He did not say one word about Fundamentalist
Protestants and Evangelical Protestants.


<P>
How things change. These groups, in combination with other extremists
and zealots are now well financed, well organized. Not only do
they threaten religious liberty directly by harnessing religion
and a particular form of religion to state power, but they rely
on religious premises, that is nonnational premises, to seek to
destroy reproductive rights, the rights of homosexuals, free expression
that does not meet their criteria, and most basically, the rights
of women, indeed, the very place of women in modern society.


<P>
What we are being threatened with, it is not an exaggeration to
say, is a religious party in the United States, as John Swomley
has frequently and eloquently cautioned us, a party that already
threatens the independence of the Republican Party in many states
and nationwide.


<P>
For these reasons, I can think of few issues, if any, that more
imperatively demand the resources and energy of the ACLU and the
people in this room. This unfortunately is the context for our
75th anniversary and the panel that follows.


<P>
What I would like to do now is just perform my moderating duties
very briefly. You heard the introduction of all these people,
all well qualified to speak to us today, and the first will be
John Siegenthaler.


<P>
(Applause.)


<P>
MR. SIEGENTHALER: Thank you very much. As I listened and the previous
panel finished, I was standing talking to a friend of mine from
Tennessee there at the edge of the platform, and he asked me where
I came in the order, and I told him I thought first, and as I
walked away, I heard him say to someone I did not know, having
John Siegenthaler follow Jocelyn Elders is like having Mother
Teresa followed by Tammy Faye Baker.


<P>
It's nice to be here today. As you may tell, I am a southern boy.
I hope I don't need a translator. Norman is not qualified to translate
southern. The last time I spoke before a group of the ACLU it
was in Alabama a few years ago. It was a smaller group.


<P>
Not long after we established the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt
University, I received a telephone call from an irate woman who
had read in the newspapers about the creation of the center, and
she demanded to know, when are you people at that First Amendment
Center going to do something to get Rush Limbaugh off the air.
And I explained to her that -- I explained to her that getting
people off the air was not really our mission, and indeed, we
encouraged more voices, not fewer, and I suggested to her that
the best way to hush Rush was simply to turn off the knob on the
dial and she said, I did that already and I got G. Gordon Liddy.


<P>
When Ira Glasser asked me to come here today, I wondered about
the rationality of the invitation. After all, I come from the
state that is headquarters for several Protestant religious institutions,
some of them Fundamentalist. For three quarters of a century,
thanks to Menken, my state is known as The Buckle on the Bible
Belt.


<P>
It struck me there is sort of a symbolic logic involved here.
For one thing, this summer is a 75th anniversary of more than
the ACLU. I cannot say from the Tennessee perspective that it's
a celebration, as it is here. 75 years ago we in Tennessee had
the Scopes trial in which a public school teacher was prosecuted
because the lame-brained legislature in my state had insisted
that the children be taught they had fallen from angels, rather
than elevated from apes.


<P>
For another reason, as I look at politics today at both the federal
and the state levels, the words that flow from the lips of our
most dominant politicans send, I think, a clear signal that much
of our entire country now is girded by the mentality of the Bible
Belt.


<P>
The Buckle reflects much of the current commercial and cultural
life of the nation's geography as well as its politics. Even as
we sit here, that Bible Belt mentality threatens to deny -- by
this time today, it may already have denied -- a qualified professional,
a decent man of Christian conviction, a product of the Bible Belt
region, his chance to serve as Surgeon General of the United States
to succeed an eloquent and effective Surgeon General denied her
opportunity to serve for many of the same reasons. Truth flowed
from the lips of Senator Phil Gramm yesterday when he said, yes,
this is about abortion.


<P>
It's interesting to me that the Senate can listen to the truth
from the lips of Phil Gramm but not from Jocelyn Elders. This,
he said, is about abortion, not abortion alone. He is right again.
Not about abortion alone. It's about other things. For one important
thing, it's about racism. To deny him this opportunity to serve
seriously plays, I suggest, to the most racist instincts of our
society.


<P>
The Bible Belt Buckle mentality of which I speak is expressed
most often, I think, in the religion of those who believe it is
a sin, the law of the land notwithstanding, a violation of moral
law, murder, for a woman to choose to have an abortion. That mentality
permeates the media, and if you pay attention -- and I know many
of you don't bother to pay attention to this -- you will find
that there is more than Rush and Liddy on the dial. There is Robertson
and Robertson and Falwell and Ainsley and Swaggart and others.
I say of those, like the organ at Winchester Cathedral, it is
audible at five miles, punishing at three, lethal at one.


<P>
But that mentality, it seems to me, saturates much of our society,
threatens basic values. It labels those who believe, as I said,
in a woman's choice as sinners, and it labels those who support
the arts of corrupting the minds of the young. It labels those
who support public broadcasting as promoters of the obscene. It
labels those who are homosexuals as sick sinners, and I tell you
what I think is sick and sinful, it is to accept the courage and
commitment and skill of those homosexuals in the military but
deny them their constitutional right to say succinctly and candidly,
I am what I am.


<P>
The know-nothing mentality of the 1850s is alive and well in the
1990s, in the military, and that same mentality, that same Buckle
and Bible Belt mentality labels those who support separation of
church and state as a vital, precious part to our national heritage
as traitors to that national religious heritage, enemies of our
religious liberty. The Buckle on the Bible Belt mentality is exemplified
by those who say that if you agree with Tom Paine, who said my
church is my own mind, you are a heretic. It says that you betray
your nation's values.


<P>
I think it says something about the failure of our educational
institutions over these several decades, and particularly the
last two decades, to understand about our religious heritage.
I think in a very distinct way that failure to reflect what our
religious heritage is about in the public schools has contributed
to this mentality.


<P>
You, with the American Civil Liberties Union do not need for some
Bible Belt yokel to come here and tell you on this 75th anniversary
what you already know, that the legacy of Roger Williams is in
jeopardy, the legacy of George Mason is in danger, the legacy
of Jefferson is threatened, the legacy of the First Amendment,
meaning the very definition of separation of church and state,
are all at serious risk.


<P>
The school prayer amendment, among others, embraced by a mentality
of the Bible Belt, has put our nation in a political stranglehold,
and the hinge on that has swung too far in one direction so it
has the potential of uprooting values planted in our culture two
centuries ago and more. It shows no sign of moving back toward
the center.


<P>
You of the ACLU know better than I what's transpired. It is not
just one senator, mine, from Tennessee, who voted yesterday against
a good man and for the Bible Belt mentality. There are others
in states far removed from Tennessee, as most of you know, who
cast that vote documenting that the Bible Belt mentality has shown
itself to be elastic enough to stretch and embrace us all.


<P>
You know better than I that for 12 years, those who wear that
belt and brandish the buckle sought to stack the Supreme Court
of the United States, and failing that, they intensified their
efforts last election to impose their will and their way in order
to have a school prayer amendment, and other amendments that threaten
to shred the First Amendment.


<P>
Are these the ruminations, mournings of the southern cynic who
smells the flowers and looks for the coffin? I don't think so.
Don't wait for judgment day, it comes every day, and I think I
saw the hearse go by the last time I went to vote. I think I heard
the funeral dirge in that election every time there was a debate
or failed to be a debate, because it seemed to me that those men
and women I had long respected in politics ran from the field,
and many who supported them took their reelection for granted.


<P>
It seems to me that success came that day, that judgment day,
that judgment day that affects us still, because those of the
Bible Belt mentality believed in themselves, better knew their
values, better understood what was important to them, were willing
to work, vote, speak, and give their money to back those values
in which they believed.


<P>
What I find shocking is that they virtually had the field of battle
in the culture war and have it still, I think, to themselves.
As one interested in promoting principles and values embodied
in the 45 words of the First Amendment, I see little indication
that the debate has been joined yet, and as a result, I think
the First Amendment values, particularly those embodying the separation
of church and state, are indeed in jeopardy, endangered, threatened,
and at risk.


<P>
I saw those candidates pay for commercials that were vapid, weak
echoes of their opponents, that endorsed school prayer, that attacked
laws and Supreme Court decisions that assured religious liberty,
freedom of conscience, freedom of choice, freedom of speech. Those
commercials paid for by candidates many of us had supported for
many years, but politics prevail over principle.


<P>
Eleanor Roosevelt once said those who stand for nothing stand
to lose everything, even their self-esteem, and it occurs to me,
sadly, that that last judgment day, many of them lost their self-esteem.
I suspect that political scientists who will review the events
of what happened in politics on that day, or what's going on in
this country right now, will look back on that campaign and find
that indeed the winning side was more highly motivated, more involved
in the struggle, more committed to their ideals, more intent on
victory than those who failed to join them in debate.


<P>
It's been said that a cult is a religious group not large enough
to be called a minority. A decade ago we ignored those from the
Bible Belt who were railing against the Supreme Court's decision
separating church and state. We called them a cult. Five years
ago they became a minority and now their voices quite often represent
the majority in our Congress.


<P>
How did they gain those converts? It's a strain of puritanism,
and you know the definition of a puritan: One who lives with the
haunting fear that someone somewhere may be having a happy and
enjoyable life.


<P>
Was that streak so broad, its appeal so magnetic? I think not.
I think there are many of us who were lulled into a sense of false
security by those very Supreme Court opinions that repeatedly
held that God was in his heaven and all was right with the world,
or perhaps there was no God in heaven anywhere but there was nothing
to worry about. But there was something to worry about because
there were millions and millions of people in this country who
did not agree with the impact and the effect and result of those
opinions, and gradually, the appeal of the Bible Belt mentality
found them, caught them up, led them on.


<P>
I think they are still ambivalent, still questioning, still in
doubt, particularly as they see mentality now expressed in ways
that they don't agree with, that do concern them, that do seem
extremist, and still the question is, have we at the other side
joined the debate.


<P>
I don't want to say more than a good old boy needs to to people
who know most of what he thinks and perhaps what he feels, but
I do worry that our failure to have a system of public education
that includes as part of its history the religious heritage of
the country is one that betrays the founders as much as if we
were pushing for the teaching of religion rather than about religion
in the schools.


<P>
I know there are those here who feel the American Civil Liberties
Union need not bother much about my concerns about public education
and whether it needs a dramatic change so that we can teach our
children about the sacrifice of Roger Williams, who was banished,
about the sacrifice of the first Jews who came to this country
and were exiled by Peter Stuyvesant from New Amsterdam and the
second wave welcomed to Rhode Island by Roger Williams, or about
the fact that John Adams wrote early in the days of this country
that it was impossible for a free society to exist in a state
where Roman Catholics were citizens.


<P>
We have had religious persecution in this country from the beginning,
with the native Americans, then the Mormons, and then the Jews
and the Catholics, many Protestant sects, and now many from Islam
suffer from it. Our children need to know about it and to make
judgments about it and to have it ingrained once more in their
lives. But again, as I say, the ACLU knows that. When I think
of the ACLU on this 75 anniversary, I think of the words of Frost.
In the heart of man is an adolescent free to go with the drift
of things.


<P>
It has never been that the ACLU went with the drift of things.
It has always been true to the heart of man and woman in this
country, true to the soul of this society. For that reason, I
am proud to be here today to talk about the threat of the Bible
Belt mentality which threatens the separation of church and state.
Thank you very much.


<P>
MR. DORSEN: Thanks very much, John. You will have a hard time
convincing people that you are just a little old country boy.


<P>
Now I would like to introduce Reverend Giddings-Ivory.


<P>
REVEREND GIDDINGS-IVORY: Good afternoon. I was asked to say, to
have a few comments after the presentation you just heard, and
excuse me, I am just getting over bronchitis, so I will really
be brief.


<P>
What I would really like to do is to share with you from the point
of view of where the churches are on these issues. We have been
working very hard on the church-state religious liberty issues
over the years, and particularly these last few years in Washington.


<P>
As we go through the halls of Congress and speak to members of
Congress, I was taken aback not too long ago when a member of
Congress asked me, what is the difference between the Presbyterian
Church and the Christian Coalition.


<P>
It caught me off guard for a moment until I realized that many
of them may not really understand the difference, and many of
the people who write our newspaper stories may not understand
the difference.


<P>
But one of the things I have begun to say is that the historic
churches in the country, like the Baptists, Lutherans, Methodists,
the Church of the Brethren and the United Church of Christ, have
a history of trying to protect religious liberty because of the
persecutions they suffered when they came to this country, and
that is very keenly a memory for many of us.


<P>
The Christian Coalition, I tell people, may have the fringe elements
of those of us who are of those denominations I just mentioned,
but the Christian Coalition is not a denomination, they do not
fit the criteria of a denomination. They do not ordain clergy,
they do not teach Bible class, nor do they have congregations,
so that is something you want to remember, if you ever encounter
this in going out to various groups.


<P>
I have with me here a statement that we have in the Presbyterian
Church that was written in 1988. It is our major religious liberty
document, and it is entitled &quot;God Alone is Lord of the Conscience&quot;
and it has various issues related to the overall topic. I would
just like to read to you briefly what that title means so you
get some indication of where we are as religious groups.


<P>
That God alone is lord of the conscience and has left it free
from the doctrines and commandments of men which are in anything
contrary to God's word in matters of faith or worship. Therefore,
we consider the right of private judgment in all matters that
respect religion as universal and inalienable. We do not even
wish to see any religious institution aided by the civil power
further than may be necessary for protection and security, and
at the same time be equal and common to all others.


<P>
I think that sets the stage or the platform or the foundation
for where we are as religious groups, wanting to protect the right
of those of us who do practice faith, who do deal with spiritual
petitions as opposed to legal petitions, how we would like to
be sure that these things are protected.


<P>
The headings that we have in this document have to do with the
conduct motivated by conscience, and under that category, we would
include military service and other civic duties, conscientious
objection and civil disobedience, the freedom to choose medical
treatment or faith healing, conditions of employment, Sabbath
observance nondiscrimination, whether a person has the right to
declare having a day off from work that is that person's Sabbath;
use of illegal drugs for religious purposes, and we all know of
that as the Peyote case, as happened over the last few years,
leading to the Religious Restoration Act.


<P>
Sanctuary for political activities. The Presbyterian Church in
particular is concerned about this in that one of our congregations
in Arizona, during the Central American refugee movement was caught
up in that, in having been infiltrated by federal entities actually
coming into Bible classes and recording prayers people were conducting
as that congregation participated in the sanctuary movement, and
we dusted that policy off recently for the counter-terrorism legislation
that was going through Washington.


<P>
We are deeply involved in government and education as it relates
to the voucher systems and tuition tax credits and not wanting
public money going to private, sectarian institutions and, of
course, we are always involved in the taxation and possible taxation
of churches and religious property.


<P>
When I worked in New York State for the New York State Council
of Churches, one of the major issues was religious conversion
or the guardianship of the individuals who are pulled into so-called
cults, and one thing that kind of dropped off of my bio for some
reason is that I did serve on the New York Civil Liberties Board
for about a year before I moved from New York to Washington, D.C.,
so I did work in some of your circles. So we are concerned about
religious expression in public places, so that it is not imposed
on other persons.


<P>
One of the things I like to share with people, especially when
we are talking about prayer in school, and that's one of the issues
we are called on a lot to deal with, and I try to explain to Congress,
or members of Congress, that even having a moment of silence is
imposing a particular religious tradition on an individual, and
we don't all have agreement about that within our religious community
as to whether a moment of silence is or is not appropriate.


<P>
But it seems to me that if your religious tradition says that
you have to chant or speak as you are in a spiritual petition
with God, as you understand God, to impose a moment of silence
on that individual is imposing a form of prayer.


<P>
I also try to remind them that even those of us who are so-called
or within the Protestant groups don't all pray alike either. Some
of us who are in the Catholic tradition or Pentecostal tradition,
when we pray, we stand. Those of us who are Episcopalians, when
they say prayers, they kneel. I would like to say most of us who
are Presbyterian, and others, we bow our heads or hold our noses.
So we cannot all be forced into one mode of prayer.


<P>
And it sounds strange, as we all, as people hear me get up as
a member of the clergy, a member of a faith group, speaking against
prayer, but we are not speaking against prayer. We all know the
Equal Access Law in 1980 allowed everyone to form their groups
and they can form a Bible study group. What we are concerned about
is state-sponsored prayer, and that's why we are continuing to
work very hard on that.


<P>
I have not watched the clock, I am probably very close to seven
minutes, so I will stop at this point and then will be available
to answer questions. Thank you.


<P>
MR. DORSEN: The next speaker will be Ruti Teitel.


<P>
MS. TEITEL: I am pleased to be here and I want to add just to
the introduction that I feel very much at home. I have served
on the ACLU Church-State Committee for a number of years now,
as well as, together with Nadine, my colleague, at the NYU Law
School.


<P>
Norman began by talking about the movement concerning religious
liberty being on the ground and I couldn't agree more. My task
is to sort of set out a little of the legal framework, so let
me just start with a recent anecdote.


<P>
Nadine Strossen and I recently were part of a debate at William
and Mary Law School with Pat Robertson on the subject of religion
in the public schools, and he began his address, which was ostensibly
about religion in the public schools, by talking about a rape
of a woman in New Bedford by a gang of men, teenagers, and he
talked in agonizing detail about this rape, and as I was feeling
more and more sick, I thought, when is the segueway going to come
to religion in the public schools, what is the rape analogy, and
he seemed, after about 10 minutes of discussing this rape, he
then said, as bad as this rape was -- this is Reverend Robertson
-- as bad as this rape was, this is nothing compared to the rape
of America, of its constitutional traditional by the liberals,
public interest lawyers and law professors. And that's us, right?


<P>
And he went on from there to say that the constitutional tradition,
the vitality of religion, he described, at the founding has essentially
been stolen, had been raped by this group, this cabal of public
interest lawyers and others, and at William and Mary Law School
-- this is the troubling part, even more troubling than his talk
-- Reverend Robertson was thanked for an inspiring address.


<P>
This is not an infrequent event. Robertson and the Christian Coalition
have been engaging in this sort of fighting words, and this is
fighting words, despite the fact that it is coming from a religious
tradition, and the analogies, and the terms are that we are in
the midst of a culture war, we are in the midst of a Civil War,
and it is we versus they, and this is the language of the Contract
with America, and that is that the religious freedom issue is
something that has been taken away from Americans, from the individual,
from the private citizen by government and it's time to give it
back to you. Essentially that citizens in this country have been
raped by us.


<P>
I want to talk about the elective developments, the movement on
the ground and then say something about the case law. Although
I think the case law is very much related to the elective initiative,
it is by no means where all the action is right now.


<P>
The proposed constitutional amendment that is part of the Contract
with America continues in this theme, and the theme is that religion
is beleaguered, in fact there is hostility against religion, and
this is due to the federal and state government. This is just
a counterpart to the Contract with America, because the Contract
with America was that economic issues have been taken away from
you by big government, just as the Republicans have been favoring
and sponsoring the balanced budget amendment, the line item veto
and have had no hesitation to alter a constitutional arrangement
that has existed for 200 years plus. The same restructuring of
federal-state relations over the economy is reflected in the church-state
area.


<P>
Now, here is why we do need to think about church-state relations,
not just individual liberty, because the way the Contract with
America reads and Contract with the Family reads, we are in the
midst of a massive constitutional transformation which would set
us back from the present balance of power, federal-state, to a
different arrangement, and the proposed constitutional amendment
reads like the Contract with America in the sense that it says
that neither the United States nor the state shall abridge --
and they talk about freedom of a person or a group -- in a way
that would discriminate on the basis of religion, all of which
sounds very nice and uses equality of access language.


<P>
It then goes on to say nothing in the constitution should deprive
individuals of public or ceremonial accommodation, meaning that
there should be much more religion in the public sphere.


<P>
What I would like to do is talk about these three parts of the
program of this political manifesto and then show how these three
parts connect up with the developments in the case law.


<P>
The idea that in some way constitutional tradition in this country
has turned its back on the individual is very insidious and there
are three claims that are made or three agendas. One concerns
religion in the public schools, religion for children, and this
has been an area of enormous struggle, and it's probably the central
area of debate concerning religion in this country, and it is
about the values of the future, future values in America.


<P>
Why do we care so much about what goes on in the public schools?
It's the future. That's why they call it a Civil War. It is a
war about the future values of America, so it is very important
what goes on in the public schools.


<P>
The second part of the program concerns funding and here there
is a debate, of course, about to what extent religious schools
and other religious organizations can be beneficiaries, like other
nonreligious organizations, of funding, government funding, state
funding. Call it benefits, call it parochia, that is the second
part of the change.


<P>
The third part is even broader, that is all forms of religion
in public life. This goes way beyond the question of church-state
relations, and it is about having more religion in public life.


<P>
The second part of the constitutional drive talked about ceremonial
religion, about public officials being engaged in religious practices.
It's about having prayer before government meetings, it is about
religious displays in City Hall, in front of courthouses and so
forth.


<P>
Now, in these three parts, the claim is that religion has been
discriminated against in these three areas and that religion is
sort of a stepchild in this country, that it is beleaguered, that
there is a hostility, in sharp contrast to the presentation we
just heard about the vitality of the Presbyterian Church and about
the vitality of churches in this country, which is ironically
reflected by the political activities we have seen the Christian
Coalition able to engage in. But the claim is just the reverse,
that somehow religion is suffering in this country and we need
a constitutional amendment and other changes in the courts to
bring that to an equal status with other nonreligious secular
philosophies and secular values.


<P>
Now, one part of this claim is clearly false, you know, and this
debate is part of a very big PR drive and I am happy to say the
ACLU has taken a very affirmative stance, I have seen ads in The
New York Times the ACLU has taken out, trying to correct the errors
and statements of the Christian Coalition, so that part, there
is a part that is clearly falling, and I will talk about the state
of the law and the way individual liberty and expression is covered
in schools and elsewhere.


<P>
There is another part, however, that raises a broader issue for
us and I want to touch upon that in discussing the cases, and
that is the question of to what extent religion should be treated
in the exact same way as secular philosophies and secular organizations
that are not churches, and that is a broader debate, something
being discussed at every level and it is an issue that all of
this political activity raises.


<P>
Let me talk about both aspects, both the question of what is the
existing status of religion and the legal protection, and what
about this country, to what extent should religion be treated
differently both in constitutional law and in our political life.


<P>
On the three points, religion in the public schools, parochia
and religion in public life, let me just say something about each
of them just briefly, concerning religion in the public schools,
and you will see a lot of discussion about this in political debate
today, there is separation of church and state still.


<P>
The Supreme Court had ruled in the 1960s that there couldn't be
teacher-led school organized prayer. Now, having said that, okay,
and you have to pay attention to every part of that sentence,
there is a lot of other alternative prayer and individual prayer
in the schools. For one thing, the Supreme Court has not unambiguously
ruled out moments of silence. In a case that followed the school
prayer case, the court said that moments of silence might be constitutional
so long as they weren't intended to be allowing school prayer,
that they were not intended to be prayer. There has been a lot
of development concerning moments of silence, about 20 states
in the country have moments of silence laws, allowing the students
moments of silence.


<P>
Now, in addition to that, there is a whole other area of school
prayer development, and that is although the Supreme Court said
there couldn't be school-sponsored school prayer, the developments
-- and this is certainly something that the Christian Coalition
has been spearheading, the development has been in the area of
student-initiated school prayer, quote, unquote, student initiated,
because what we are seeing is whether the schools and state individuals
can delegate the decision over school prayer to private individuals,
and to what extent does this then become private prayer.


<P>
This is a very big question all over both the elective initiatives
and in the case law, and what we have seen is there is a big debate
about this question, and just to give you an example, there are
two Circuit Court decisions, each of which has held in the opposite
way concerning student initiated graduation prayer, and that's
where this debate has been most vigorous, is whether student initiated
graduation prayer is constitutional. That has yet to be decided
by the Supreme Court because the case that the Supreme Court did
decide was not one initiated by the students, but rather led by
an outside rabbi.


<P>
Now, this debate about student initiation was one that the ACLU
was part of and it grows out of the last time that a serious constitutional
amendment initiative was initiated in Congress, and that was in
1984, and even though we won that struggle in the sense that there
isn't a constitutional amendment that would override the Supreme
Court's decisions in the 1960s, we did end up with the first federal
law protecting school prayer and which ended up encouraging all
of this development at the high school and junior high school
level all over the country, and that was the Equal Access Act
which followed that initiative that began in 1984.


<P>
Now let me turn to the second area of development and area of
case law, which is the question of funding and benefits, and here,
as Norman reminded us, in the 1970s, Lemon v. Kurtzman, one word
that people remember about church-state relations, it's the Lemon
test, and that seems that it should be, that separation of church
and state went all the way back to the founders, that there shouldn't
be funding for religious education, and that is certainly an area
where the United States has been unique, almost unique, in modern
democracies.


<P>
Recent developments suggest a movement away from this, and recent
cases in the Supreme Court have said that if it isn't just religious
schools that are being benefited, but other nonreligious beneficiaries,
that it would uphold such as constitutional.


<P>
That means to me if there ever were a serious voucher drive, the
Supreme Court would uphold vouchers without a doubt and we would
see a very big change in the area of funding for religious education.


<P>
There is a case we are all watching. The Supreme Court is going
to decide Rosenberger in the next couple of weeks and that is
a case concerning funding at the university level for a student
club that produces a religious publication, and that will be a
mini case that will give us some sense of the direction of which
way the wind is blowing in the Supreme Court concerning religious
funding.


<P>
There is one other development I think is very interesting in
the area of funding and then I will move quickly to religion in
public life, and that is that the legal arm of the Christian Coalition
has dared to change the 501(C)3 limits on politicking by church
groups and other religious organizations. They are defending Ralph
Reed's church which has been sued by the IRS for putting up an
ad against Clinton which was clearly political activity.


<P>
Now, if the 501(C)3 protections go by the wayside, I think we
are seeing a completely different, a completely different legal
framework for churches in this country and really, I would say
a major shift in church-state relations.


<P>
Let me end lastly with the area of ceremonial religion and religion
in public life, religion in politics, and that is that we have
seen the Supreme Court all over the map on this issue. On the
one hand, the Supreme Court had said that prayers in the legislature,
prayers in state legislatures is constitutional. On the other
hand, the court says that prayer at graduations raises establishment
clause issues and protecting children from the broader role of
religion in public life.


<P>
But there is a much broader question still, which is that the
movement now in this country, it suggests, the rhetoric suggests
that religion is somehow hidden, it is private, and that's what
the liberals have favored and it is time to get religion out in
the public square. They talk about the naked public square and
we are seeing a lot of case law and discussion about religious
symbols and crosses, and there is a case pending in the Supreme
Court which will soon get a decision on, on a KKK cross right
in front of the Ohio statehouse.


<P>
Now, these cases are difficult and I don't want to minimize the
complexity, because in many instances, for instance, the cross
in front of the statehouse, in involves what many consider traditionally
a public forum. However, the lines between private and public
in this age of technology have become blurry. A park right next
to a statehouse gains the legitimacy, a cross right in front of
the statehouse gains the legitimacy of the statehouse. That's
why the KKK are right there in front of the statehouse.


<P>
I think it is time to address those areas of ambiguity and it
is time for us to think about better explaining why there needs
to be special treatment for religion and that it's not an answer
to simply assert that religious equality will benefit from the
exact same constitutional traditions and structure as apply to
secular and political organizations.


<P>
I think that it is time for the ACLU and for others, for all of
us to go back and to explain better in what way the founders struggled
with this issue and ultimately came down on the side of individual
religious liberty being better protected by not having state religion
or anything like it.


<P>
And we also have to explain that religious diversity and religious
practice are healthy and very vital in this country. That was
true at the time that de Tocqueville wrote, and it is obviously
very true today, and that this is because of the separation of
church and state and not despite it.


<P>
I would be happy to answer questions but my time is up. Thanks.


<P>
(Applause.)


<P>
MR. DORSEN: Thank you Ruti. One way we are going to disappoint
you is that you will not be able to answer questions, nor will
the other panelists, because there will not be time for questions
since both our panel and the previous panel, I am advised by the
highest sources imaginable, Barry Steinhardt, went overtime, so
we will just wind up with Steve Shapiro, who you all know.


<P>
Take it away.


<P>
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I don't know if your family is like my family,
but in my family periodically we have these dinner parties, invite
the people over for dinner, and at the 11th hour decide we don't
have enough food to share with everybody. So we say FHB, meaning
family hold back. As a member of the family, at five to 4:00,
my role is to hold back here and simply stand up and say, I agree
with everything that's been said and send you off to your coffee,
and that is largely what I am going to do.


<P>
I promised Barry that I would speak for no more than three minutes,
which is a system I have developed in 20 years of being in the
ACLU, often having to follow Ira at the podium.


<P>
Let me just say three things, none of which are particularly connected.
It would be more eloquent if I had 15 minutes, but in three minutes
I will say three quick things.


<P>
One was that I had an interesting experience the other day, which
is I got a fax message, really unexpected. It just arrived at
my office the other day, it arrived without an explanation, and
what it was was an official proclamation by the governor of South
Carolina, official state stationery, with the seal on the top,
declaring the last week in May, I believe it was, to be March
for Jesus Week in South Carolina, and it was a four-paragraph
state proclamation that began by reciting from one of the apostles,
I forget which one, and ended up by calling on all people of faith
in South Carolina to march with Jesus.


<P>
One of the advantages of being in the national office is I get
to put this in a fax machine, send this down to South Carolina
and say, what are you doing about this, and I get back very, very
promptly an article from the, from one of the South Carolina newspapers,
with the headline that says &quot;ACLU Fumes.&quot; I thought
to myself, I am proud to belong to an organization that fumes.


<P>
The second sort of unrelated, a totally unrelated story, has to
do with the comment that Ruti made about school vouchers, and
it relates, in fact, to a comment that John Siegenthaler made
about public education, its relationship to religious education.


<P>
I think many of us, myself included, think that school vouchers
are really what the game is all about and that we are soon heading
toward a major legal battle over the constitutionality of school
vouchers, and I agree that it is going to be a difficult legal
battle, which was Ruti's assessment as well. I am not quite as
convinced -- I can't be, I couldn't do my job if I were quite
as convinced -- that it is a battle that we cannot win, but I
am sure that it is a battle that we will wage and there is, in
fact, a school voucher bill that is on the verge of being passed
in the State of Wisconsin, and the Wisconsin affiliate and the
national office, I hope, are already gearing up to challenge that
law, and so we will be there, and we will be in there fighting.


<P>
The last comment I want to make and then I will really send you
off to the coffee break, and this is what I was going to talk
about if we had more time, was what I see as a very difficult
issue in this area, of the ACLU. When we talk about school vouchers,
school prayer, those are difficult legal battles, and the lawyers
have troubles when they get into court because the Supreme Court
is not as sympathetic as it once was, but we know the arguments
we will make, how to frame them, we go in and do our best.


<P>
There is somewhat shifting terrain in this area, though, that
has to do with another legal development, and that is the religious
right, and not by coincidence the Supreme Court, in recent years,
I think, has discovered the free speech clause, and they have
discovered the free speech clause as a way to promote religion,
and they have increasingly begun to recharacterize what formerly
would have been religion claims as free speech claims. That is
what the graduation prayer cases are about, that is what the Klan
cross case is about that Ruti talked about, that is what the Rosenberger
case is all about, which has to do with funding from the state
university to support a religious student journal.


<P>
Those are the issues that put the ACLU in a much more difficult
position because, after all, we do generally believe in free speech
and we do generally take the position that the government cannot
discriminate against speakers based upon the viewpoint of their
speech, and it is not implausible when religion speakers come
in and say my religion is a viewpoint, and why can't I express
my viewpoint when others can express their viewpoint and isn't
that the type of hostility that the First Amendment is meant to
protect.


<P>
Within the context of the religion clauses, it is easy to say,
aha, there is an establishment clause, but as the ground has shifted
and it is increasingly being fought out in the grounds of the
free speech clause, it is still possible to say, aha, there is
an establishment clause. But the legal arguments get a little
more difficult, the policy arguments get a little more difficult
and it is frankly an issue that we as an organization are still
grappling with, trying to find out where the fault lines are and
find out exactly where the right position is.


<P>
I will tell you as a matter of information, if you don't know
this, the two cases Ruti talked about, the Klan cross case, and
the religious journal case at the University of Virginia, in the
Klan cross case, the national office supported the right of the
Klan to place their cross in the public park on the grounds that
a public forum was a public forum, this was a form of speech,
and in the case with the University of Virginia, we took the stand
is what the university could not fund the journal, even though
it was simultaneously funding secular journals, because funding
for religion was fundamentally different and funding for religion
that the establishment clause absolutely prohibited.


<P>
Both of the cases will be decided Monday or Wednesday of next
week. We will have a better sense of the way the Supreme Court
is heading, but I think from our own internal perspective, those
are issues that are going to continue to plague us in coming years.
We are going to have to think our way through some very knotty
problems, and having said that, I will now send everybody off
to the bar.


<P>
MR. DORSEN: We regret there is no time for questions but there
will be plenty of time for discussion later. Thank you very much.

<center><h1>Transcript of Substantive Plenary VII<br>
 Immigration and Xenophobia</center></h1>
              <STRONG>MS. RIPSTON:</STRONG>  Thank you, Wendy, and it's
   good to be here.  It is wonderful to be asked to
    sketch out the problems about zenophobia and
    immigration and then never really talk to anybody.
   This organization asks you to do something, and
    then nobody tells you exactly what to do.
<P>               In November of 1994, in a movement born
    of fiscal austerity and nativism, California voted
    three to two to deny undocumented people and their
   children education, health care and many other
   government benefits.  In the same election,
   Republicans gained control of Congress, after
   campaigning on the Contract with America's promise
   that more than $4 billion per year could be saved
   by barring legal immigrants from such programs as
   Medicaid, food stamps and welfare.
  <P>            Several years before these events,
   Arizona had passed an initiative barring employees
   in government offices, government agencies, from
   speaking any language other than English.
<P>              Both Proposition 187 and the Arizona
   initiative have not been implemented because of
   court orders, but the final fate of both is still
   up in the air.  Two of the most contested voting
   rights cases in recent years come from Los Angeles
    and Dade County, the counties leading the nation
    with the highest percentage of adult noncitizens.
    An important issue in each case is whether the
   principle of one person, one vote means local
    districts should contain equal number of persons,
  including citizens and noncitizens or only equal
   number of citizens.
<P>
              Excluding noncitizens from the local
   apportionment base means shifting the power away
   from areas with large populations of Latinos and
   other immigrant groups.  We won this issue then but
   can a move to exclude noncitizens from local
   apportionment bases be far behind now?  With the
   anti-immigration tide running higher than it has in
   decades, a prestigious federal commission headed by
   Barbara Jordan, who has generally been a friend of
   civil liberties and citizen rights, has called for
   a national identity card and a national employment
   registry.
<P>              Three weeks ago, the Bipartisan Federal
   Commission proposed that the United States slash
   legal immigration by one third and virtually close
   the nation's borders to extended family members of
   citizens.  The commission also suggested imposing a
   fee on employers who hire foreign professionals.
<P>
              The Judiciary Committee has decided that
   it is not enough to deny children education and
   health care, but that undocumented people should be
  punished just for actually being here in the United
   States.  In addition, they have suggested that
   there be a 14-mile wall between Mexico and the
   United States.
<P>              Immediately after the bombing of the
   federal building in Oklahoma, there was a rush to
   blame Arabs for that horrible deed.  No one even
   thought that possibly white males from middle
   America might be responsible.  Right after that,
   the counterterrorist bill passed the Senate.
<P>              Is there any doubt that America is in
   the throes of zenophobia and anti-immigration
   frenzy?  It is not the first time this has happened
   in our history.  In 1919 there were the infamous
   Palmer raids.  The ACLU was there then and we have
   been there throughout our 75-year history whenever
   there has been an attempt to subject vulnerable
   immigrants to a denial of civil liberties, and we
   must be there again.  In times of economic
   difficulty or fear about national security,
   newcomers become the scapegoat for our economic and
   political problems.
  <P>           We know that the story of prejudices
   about race has been permitted to substitute for
   genuine responses to social and political and
   economic problems.  We somehow have to help shape
   the debate to make people understand that
   immigration has been and remains vital to a growing
   economy, that immigrants contribute more to this
   community than they take out.  People must be made
   to understand that the impact of policies like
   those included in Prop. 187 on public health and
  safety, have a grave, grave effect on innocent
  people and children.  And above all, we must be
  unified in our commitment to respond affirmatively
  to the denial of rights to immigrants.
<P>              Yesterday at the session on racial
   equality, there was a plea from all three
   participants for unity.  So in closing, I would
   like to make that same plea.  That immigration and
   zenophobia become one of the very important issues
   to the American Civil Liberties Union.
<P>              I know that it affects some of us more
   than others, that some states have a higher number
   of people who are noncitizens than other states,
   but we have to talk about people, and this
   organization must be there and we must be unified
   about it.
<P>              You know, when we in Los Angeles wanted
   to reform the Los Angeles Police Department, we
    formed a coalition.  Most of the members of that
    coalition turned out to be African-Americans,
    because it was the Los Angeles Police Department
    which policed African-American neighborhoods.  When
    we turned our attention to the sheriff's department
    and we formed another coalition, we had mostly
   Latinos, because the sheriff's department polices
   mostly Latino neighborhoods.  When we put a 187
   coalition together, we mostly had Latinos.
              We must all come together on these
   problems.  We must fight together because
   otherwise, we will all be lost.
<P>
              Ira?
<P>
              <STRONG>MR. GLASSER:</STRONG>  This is Peter Brimlow's
   book.  I carry it with me all the time when I need
   a rush of adrenalin, and it works so well so I am
   always afraid I am going to be arrested for
   possession of an illegal drug.
<P>              This is Peter Brimlow's nightmare.  This
   shirt has "Children of the World" on it and I stole
   it from my wife this morning when she wasn't
   looking.  This is a picture of children from all
   over the world, different faces and colors and
   hairdos and clothes, and that issue of race, I
    think, as we hope to demonstrate, is really at the
    bottom of what the politics of this issue is about
    and why it is so core, so much of a core ACLU
    issue.
 <P>              Immigration is not, by itself, a civil
    liberties issue, and it ought not to be thought of
    as something marginal or something new.  As Ramona
   said, we have been involved in these issues from
   the very earliest years of the ACLU's history, and
   basically, what you have in the area of immigration
   are at least three core civil liberties issues, which
   are taking place in the context of immigration.
<P>              It is not that immigration is a civil
   liberties issue, it is that race is a civil
   liberties issue and discrimination on the basis of
   national origin is a civil liberties issue.  That
   would be a civil liberties issue whether it was
   taking place in the context of employment, in
   education, in the context of police abuse or in the
   context of immigration.
<P>              The First Amendment, is a core civil
   liberties issue and many of our core positions on
   political asylum flow from providing relief to
   victims of political persecution in their own
   countries.  That has been an issue we have been
    involved in from the very beginning, it is a core
    civil liberties issue that takes place in the
    context of immigration.  Due process is a core
    civil liberties issue and our concern for fair
    procedures in deportation hearings and in all sorts
    of procedures that relate to the determination of
    asyum status and things like that are core civil
   liberties concerns taking place in the context of
   immigration.
<P>              So it is a mistake, I think, to think of
   immigration as something new to the ACLU, as
   something marginal, as a kind of an add-on issue.
   It is simply a setting in which all of our core
   concerns are implicated.
<P>              Now, you know, that isn't always the way
   it is discussed in public, and I want to try to put
   aside some of the issues that often get talked
   about when this issue is debated.  This is not
   about numbers.  We have about a million immigrants
   a year coming into the country now, including
   illegals.  That's about the same amount that came
   in annually between 1901 and 1910, when the
   population was much smaller.  In 1910, when we had
   about a million immigrants a year, the population
   was 90 million.  We were looking at something like
   14, 15 percent of the population was foreign born
   at that time.
<P>              Today about 8 percent of the population
   is foreign-born and the million who are coming in
    each year are a million against a population of 250
    million.  The truth is, the numbers are not
    significant.  It is not difficult to absorb.  The
   fact that they are concentrated in a few places
   creates special problems, but certainly New York is
   one of the major areas of in-migration still, and
   it is nothing like it was in 1890, in 1905, and in
   1910.
<P>              The fact is the numbers are not a
   serious issue.  You can debate about whether it is
   800,000, 700,000, a million or one.  That is not
   really important to the issue.  It should not be
   taken seriously.
<P>              The skills are not an issue.  Julius
   Simon wrote the Economic Consequences of
   Immigration, a leading columnist, he publishes in
   places like The National Review, has said
   explicitly, that the level of skills, the level of
   education is going up, not down, in terms of the
   average of immigrants coming in, for the most part.
               The skill level is a marginal issue in
    some places, sometimes, for some people, but the
    skill level question is not a serious issue.  We
    would not be having a major divisive public debate
    about this problem if we were just talking about
    skill levels.
<P>            Economics is not an issue.  The effects
   are marginal.  There is very little doubt -- Simon
   again says that every time immigrant comes in,
   natives become richer, and every time we keep an
   immigrant from coming in, the natives become
   poorer.  By and large, the economic consequences
   are good and the wealth that immigrants produce
   over their lifetime is more than what immigrants
   cost over their lifetime.
<P>              There may be disconnects between what
   the federal government collects in taxes and what
   local governments bear in costs, but those kinds of
   issues are federal issues to be worked out not at
   the expense of immigrants, but between federal
   governments and state governments.
<P>              If New York and California, Texas and
   Florida need to have different kinds of
   income-sharing between the federal government and
   the state governments because of who collects the
   taxes and who pays for the cost of local services,
    that is an issue that needs to be addressed.  So
    economics is not an issue.
 <P>              If you look at the statistics of whether
    or not the taxes that immigrants produce are
    outweighed by the services and the benefits they
    get, the most anti-immigration economist calculates
    that $42 billion, that it is $42 billion more in
   costs than in taxes, and he is not counting Social
   Security taxes.  If he counts Social Security
   taxes, then it's a wash.
<P>              The range of economics, of economic
   estimates of whether taxes outweigh benefits or the
   other way around, range from about $25 million more
   taxes produced by immigrants than the cost of
   services to them, to $42 billion of more cost of
   services than taxes produce.  The whole range is
   trivial compared to $6 trillion of national income
   that this country realizes at this time.  It simply
   is not a serious issue, and even George Borhaus,
   the most anti-immigration economist, the one most
   often cited by our opponents said, "economic
   arguments simply are not decisive."  It is not a
   serious issue.
<P>              So what is a serious issue?  Welfare.
   Well, that is also not a serious issue.  Basically,
    immigrant families, by and large, use welfare at
    about the same rate, a little more or a little less
    from time to time, from place to place, not
    significantly different from the rate at which
    native families use welfare, and the welfare people
    I am talking about, ADC and food stamps, most
    immigrants are not even eligible for a period of
   three to five years.  The really large welfare
   programs, income tax programs, Social Security and
   Medicare, few of them get them, very few are
   elderly.  So that is not an issue.  What is?
<P>              What is, inescapably, is race and
   national origin.  This has always been the true
   American politics from the very beginning.  The
   notion that today that something different is going
   on, as Brimlow and others argue, because in the old
   days, the immigrants, they were the good
   immigrants, they came from what he calls a common
   European heritage.  Well, the common European
   heritage wasn't thought to be so common back when
   it mattered.  In 1835, there was a whole lot of
   writing about Catholics taking over America and
   being alien to the American tradition.  In 1856,
   almost every encyclopedia published made distinct
    racial categories among Swedes, Finns, Greeks,
    Hungarians, Russians, Jews, Irish, Germans.  They
   were all distinct races, they described them
    differently in the way they looked, the way they
    thought, what their generic heritage was.
 <P>              Around 1850, a leading book on
    immigration said, "while the rich Irish brogue and
    heavy German accent supplants the American idiom,
   while aliens scorn our laws or customs and our
   religion."  There was a great concern about
   bilingualism, though they didn't use that word.
<P>              In 1914, Slavs were regarded as
   nonwhites, people with, "crooked faces, coarse
   mouths, heavy jaws, and low foreheads."  What
   common European heritage?
<P>              In 1890, there were writings about the
   naturally violent Italian race.  In 1911 there was
   a federal commission that reported that new
   immigrants were less skilled, less educated, slower
   to learn English, not likely to be assimilated.  It
   wasn't true then, it isn't true now.
<P>              In 1924, following the Palmer raids,
   from which alien subversives were deported without
   trial, the view grew overwhelmingly that Eastern
   and Southern Europeans were a genetically inferior,
   culturally incompatible, not Anglo-Saxon, that
    would threaten, "the America as we know it."  So
    they passed the 1924 Act.  It was a racist act
    passed at a racist time.  It basically limited
    immigration to North and Western Europe or skewed
    the quotas to that.  Immigration plummeted, the
    source of immigration changed.
<P>               It was a racist act which was not
   changed until 1965 when another civil rights act
   was passed.  It was called the Immigration Act, but
   it was a civil rights act, passed at the peak of
   the civil rights movement, a year after the Civil
   Rights Act of '64, and the same year that the
  Voting Rights Act was passed, and it repealed all
   of the racial and national origin exclusion quotas
   of 1924, created quotas on a per-country basis
   without regard to nation or skin color or anything
   else.
<P>              That is the act that is driving the
   opposition today.  That is the act they hate and
   they hate it for the same reason that they hate
   affirmative action.  They hate it not because of
   the numbers of the people coming in but because of
   the sources of the numbers of people.  They hate it
   because they hate the skin color, the language, the
    style, the cultural incompatibility with dominant
    American life, which is to say white middle class
    American life.  When you get beneath all of the
    objections, that's what you are talking about.
 <P>              This guy Brimlow says it far better than
    I could, and if you want ammunition to support the
    racial basis for this argument, do yourself a favor
    and read this book, but not if you have high blood
   pressure.
<P>              The favor this book has done us is that
   he has come out of the closet.  Many of the
   immigrants, the anti-immigration forces, will deny
   all of that and they would like to talk about
   numbers, economics, and welfare and bilingualism.
<P>              It is all a smoke screen.  Those
   arguments need to be set aside because they are not
   significant.  What is significant is that this is a
   civil rights issue taking place in the context of
   immigration against people who are terribly
   vulnerable because they are not citizens.  It
   behooves us to do as we have always done and to be
   strong in our dense of people who are themselves
   defenseless on those grounds.  Thank you.
              (Applause.)
<P>
              <STRONG>MS. RIPSTON:</STRONG>  Valerie Small-Navaro, from
    California.<P>
               <STRONG>MS. SMALL-NAVARO:</STRONG>  First of all, I want
    to make sure that everyone can hear me.  Yes?
    Okay.  Very good.
<P>               Well, Lucas gave me the easy task, and
    that was to explain why the ACLU doesn't buy into
    the distinction between legal and illegal
    immigrants when it comes to fighting for their
   civil rights.  Before I actually get into this
   discussion, I want to make sure that everyone
   knows, if we don't already know, that the ACLU does
   not advocate for open borders.  Some of us
   privately might do so, but that is not the position
   of the ACLU.
<P>              Now, before I go out every morning into
   Sacramento to do my job as a lobbyist there, I take
   a quick look at something that's on my
   refrigerator, and that is a one-line letter from
   The Los Angeles Times.  That letter says -- and
   this happened at the height of Proposition 187 --
   who cost Orange County -- the county which is now
   in bankruptcy, as you probably all know -- more:
   A, undocumented immigrants, or, B, greedy white
   men?
<P>     
               Now, I am not saying this to sort of
    exacerbate the racial issues that Ira brought up
    but rather to try and contextualize some of this
    discussion, and I want to just quickly run through
    some of the facts on illegal immigration before I
    get into the discussion about why the ACLU doesn't
    buy into this distinction between illegal and legal
    immigrants.
<P>               Now, I guess that I want to think about
   politics.  As we all know, issues in the past have
   been very colorful.  I don't think, when we say the
   words welfare queen, we don't think about the white
   woman sitting at home with her mother.  That is not
   the image we come up with, right?  When we talk
   about Willie Horton, who are we talking about?
   When we are talking about illegal immigrants, who
   are we talking about?
<P>              I always ask myself, why is it that two
   guys from Kentucky and Wyoming, Mr. Mazoli and
   Mr. Simpson, have made their political careers
   based on the issue of illegal immigration, and I
   also ask myself who or whom, if I feel in that
   mood, whom do they blame in their states for the
   economic recession or for the recession of the
   country?  Who do they blame?
<P>    

               Let me just turn and give you some quick
    facts.  I know you are getting tired and this is
    the end of the whole biennial, but we are looking
    at 1.5 percent of the total population of this
    country is here illegally.  1. percent.  Now, does
    that justify a national ID card?  Does that justify
    Diane Feinstein wanting to put fingerprints or
    retinal scans on this national ID card?  No.
    Okay.  Thank you.
<P>              Now, if you ask me, it -- and this is
   something that someone else said, but it really
   rings home true.  This is like using an atomic bomb
   to kill a mosquito.  Why are we looking at national
   ID cards, national registry systems?
<P>              In California, where the problem is
   supposed to be so God-awful and we have supposedly
   42 percent of the undocumented, that only
   represents approximately 5 percent of our total
   population.  Now, is that a justification for
   Proposition 187, 5 percent of our total
   population?  Does that justify the "Son of
   Proposition 187," which happens to be a move to put
   an initiative on the ballot that would take away
   the right of children born in the United States to
   U.S. citizenship.  That was something given to us
 by the 14th Amendment.
<P>               To talk about race, I mean, we just have
    to look at why the 14th Amendment was put in
    place.
<P>               Now, the real problem -- and I sort of
    feel like deja vu.  When we talk about immigrants,
    illegal immigrants, it is sort of easy to dig our
    heels in on those issues, but what are the real
    problems?
<P>              I think that everyone knows that the
   country is in a recession, but what people don't
   know, for example, in California, that the state
   commission on finance said that in the fiscal year
   1993-1994, that revenues to the State of California
   would have been $13 billion, with a B, dollars
   higher, but for the recession, that our state and
   local revenues are declining as a percentage of our
   personal income taxes.  So from 1978 until 1990, we
   saw a 25 percent drop in that revenue.
<P>              So it's too easy to look at those brown
   and yellow and black hordes and blame our problems
   on them than looking and trying to address the real
   economic situation, and again, I ask you, who or
   whom are they blaming in Kentucky and Wyoming?
   It's a real big question.
<P>         

               I want to shift a little bit now and
    talk about refugees and Haitians in particular.
    All of the screaming in the newspapers about
    Haitian refugees.  How many people do you think we
    are talking about?  You would think we were talking
    about hundreds of thousands of people to come
    over.  It was 35,000 people.  I don't know how many
    pages of The New York Times, the LA Times, all of
    the newspapers out there took up on this issue.  It
   was 35,000 people.
<P>              So I think about -- I like to think
   about refugees in sort of a bigger context in the
   world.  The UN high commissioner for refugees has
   told us there are 18 million refugees out in the
   world, 18 million.  How many do you think we let
   into the country a year here in the United States?
<P>
   What portion of that 18 million do you think we
   could absorb reasonably?  Well, it's only 120,000,
   okay?  120,000 of a total population of 18
   million.
<P>              So just having given you a little bit of
   background on this issue, I wanted to turn now
   specifically to why the ACLU cannot fall into the
   same pattern as other civil rights organizations
   have when they start talking about, well, there is
    good immigrants and bad immigrants, ones that come
    here legally and ones that come here illegally, and
    I want to remind you that a boatload of Jews were
    turned away not only from one port but two ports
    when they came during World War II, that we
    experienced the internment of Americans,
    Japanese-Americans, here in the United States.
<P>            Unless we think the civil rights
    movement or the ACLU was above this, I want to
   remind you that it caused great consternation
   within the movement at large and within the ACLU
   when we decided to represent Mr. Koramatsu.  So
   please don't fall into the too easy thing, yeah, we
   support them.  It is a big question that the ACLU
   needs to look at, why we support illegal as well as
   legal immigrants, and I hate using that term.
   Undocumented is what we usually say, use that
   term.  But it is about basic human rights.  Basic
   human rights cannot be forsaken because of
   arbitrary human distinctions.
<P>              Until all of people in this country have
   the right to assert their rights as employees,
   rights as victims of crimes, rights to attend
   school, our streets, our working places, our
   schools, will not be safe for all Americans, all of
    us, all of the residents of this country, and I
    think that it's important that the ACLU take,
    continues to take the leadership position that it
    has always taken, but recognizing that we can't
    fall into this false dilemma.  Thank you.<P>
               <STRONG>(Applause.)</STRONG><P>
               <STRONG>MS. RIPSTON: </STRONG> Now Lucas Guttentag, from
    New York and California.<P>
              <STRONG> MR. GUTTENTAG:</STRONG>  Thank you very much.
   The threat to immigrants' rights right now is
   enormous, but that's nothing new, and it is not a
   lost cause.  We have seen this throughout our
   history, we have had spasms of anti-immigrant
   hysteria before and right now we are in the midst
   of a major challenge, and whenever immigrants are
   under attack, as I think Ira, Ramona and Valerie
   pointed out, whenever immigrants are under attack,
   that becomes a vehicle for those who oppose all
   kinds of individual liberties and civil rights.
<P>              That's their way, that's the way to get
   the foot in the door:  Attack the immigrants,
   because they are the ones most vulnerable, they are
   the ones with the smallest political voice, they
   are the ones with the fewest constitutional
   rights.
         
<P>
               But the very breadth of the attack is
    also the opportunity to mobilize other communities
    and other constituencies who don't always see
    immigration or immigrants' rights as an issue
    affecting them, but it is, because as we know, and
    as Ira said, and I think as everybody is beginning
    to see, immigration, attacks on immigrants is a
    vehicle for racism, but it is not just racism, it
    is homophobia, it's restrictions on free speech, it
   is a way to diminish the due process rights of
   people accused of crimes, it is a way to dilute the
   protections of the 4th Amendment, it is all those
   things.
<P>              Let me just give you one example of the
   racism front, and just these two headlines, one of
   which was just called to my attention this morning,
   and keep in mind that Canadians are the fourth
   largest undocumented population in the United
   States.  Here is one headline from a newspaper in
   Utah that ran shortly after the Immigration Service
   conducted a series of raids against employers in
   Utah.  What's the headline say?  It says, "Hiring
   Hispanics?  Watch out."
<P>              And then at the same time, while we were
   talking about building walls and ditches and
    militarizing our southern border to keep out
    Mexicans, here is the other headline, from The New
    York Times-Associated Press Wire Service on
    building express lanes into and out of Canada.  Is
    that a concern about immigration or is that a
    concern about the color of the skin of the persons
    who are coming?
<P>               And let's recall that until 1990,
    persons were denied visas solely because of their
   sexual orientation.  Under the law, homosexuality,
   as the law called it, was a form of mental disease
   or defect, and the basis for denying their visa,
   and today, being HIV-positive is a ground for
   denying protection to refugees, to people fleeing
   persecution, denying reunification of families, and
   it was the policy that caused the Clinton
   Administration, and the Bush Administration, to
   imprison over 300 Haitian refugees at an HIV prison
   camp at Guantanamo for over two years, until a
   courageous federal judge ordered them to be
   released.
<P>              Proposals in Congress call right now for
   deporting persons merely because of their
   membership in a group that the President or the
   Secretary of State designates as terrorist, even
    though that membership would be protected under the
    First Amendment, if it was a United States
    citizen.
<P>               Proposals in Congress to discriminate
    against naturalized citizens, as opposed to
    citizens born in the United States, eligibility for
    federal benefits, proposals in Congress that
    discriminate against legal permanent residents in
    state benefit programs, even though the Supreme
   Court held almost 20 years ago that that's a
   violation of equal protection and due process.
<P>              Proposals in Congress to deny birth
   right citizenship, as Valerie pointed out, to
   children because of the status of their parents,
   mothers.
<P>              Proposals to eliminate judicial review
   so that no court could review the acts of the
   Immigration Service, even though it is one of the
   most arbitrary, the most error-prone, and one of
   the most discriminatory agencies we have in the
   federal government, to prohibit any Federal Court
   from reviewing the actions of that agency.  That's
   what we are facing.
<P>              But as I said, I think there is reason
   for hope because these kinds of proposals always
    occur when the population of the immigrants
    changes, when the people are perceived as different
    from those who came before, when the economy is
    bad, when we are afraid, when people are afraid of
    conditions in our own country.
<P>               I think, quite frankly, that most of the
    anti-immigrant hysteria, if you will, is coming
    from two places: Washington, D.C., and the State of
    California.  It is being used and exploited by
   politicans, by Governor Wilson to resurrect his
   gubernatorial campaign, now by Senator Diane
   Feinstein, and others.
<P>              And it is a good question.  Why is
   Senator Simpson, from Wyoming, the most powerful
   politician about immigration in the United States?
   Wyoming is a place that has fewer immigrants in its
   entire state than work in a single hospital or
   hotel or day care center in the City of New York or
   Los Angeles or Chicago, or most other major cities
   in this country.  He can do it but he shouldn't be
   able to, to run these kind of anti-immigrant
   campaigns, to propose these kinds of anti-immigrant
   restrictions.  But they can do it because
   immigrants do not have a political voice and too
   often others don't realize what is at stake, other
    groups, other constituencies.  But when they do,
    the dynamic changes, and I think the most striking
    recent example of that is our policy towards
    Haitian refugees, because three administrations,
    the Reagan Administration, the Bush Administration,
    and the Clinton Administration, were forcibly
    repatriating Haitian refugees to what was one of
    the worst human rights abusers in the world, in
    violation of U.S. and international law.
<P>              We fought the case in the Supreme Court
   and we lost, the Supreme Court disagreed with us
   about U.S. law and the impact and force of
   international law.  But when Randall Robinson and
   the Congressional Black Caucus took up the cause
   and called that policy what it was, namely racist,
   that policy changed.  And right now, we have a
   refugee policy that admits about 125,000 people per
   year, although there are proposals to cut that
   down, but of that 125,000 refugees that we have
   been letting in each year, how many do we admit
   from Africa?  7,000 out of 125,000.  How many do we
   admit from Latin America?  3,500 out of 125,000,
   and I think if the Congressional Black Caucus,
   Hispanic Caucus and other civil rights
   organizations looked at that and saw those kinds of
    policies, those too would change.
<P>               Now we have some interesting allies on
    the immigration issue.  Sometimes they are unusual,
    sometimes they are even bizarre.  The majority
    leader, Dick Armey, has been criticized in his own
    party for the position that others have proposed
    for immigration restrictions.  William Bennett and
    Jack Kemp oppose Proposition 187 in California, and
    they don't believe in blaming immigrants for the
   problems that are going on.  Mayor Giuliani, a
   Republican and Governor Cuomo, until recently the
   Governor of New York, said that all immigrants,
   legal and illegal immigrants, were welcome in New
   York City and New York State because they saw them
   as a strength, part of what makes New York City and
   New York State great.  On the national I.D. card,
   the Cato Institute, William Crystal, Phyllis
   Schaffley, Gary Bauer, Milton Friedman, they have
   all criticized the proposal and said, you are
   right, but this is the wrong way, this is the wrong
   route to go.
<P>              And I think one other thing happened in
   the 187 campaign in California.  We saw that, the
   opposition to that proposal, to that proposition,
   mobilize an entirely new population of students.
<P>         

    They got mobilized, activated, they saw Proposition
    187 for what it was, a racist attack on certain
    communities, and I don't know how many times I have
    heard people say from California, we don't care if
    they are legal or illegal, the problem in
    California is there are too many Mexicans.  That
    was what people said.  That's what's been going
    on.
<P>               The new generation of students got
   active, got involved, got mobilized, and they
   started getting active because of opposition to
   Proposition 187.  That is another opportunity we
   have as a result of what is a going on, through
   immigration.
<P>              There are a lot of states in which
   immigration is not yet the political hot potato
   that it is.  I think one of the critical things is
   that if you live in one of those states, yours are
   the members of Congress that we can get to.  Yours
   are the ones we can reach out to.  They are not the
   ones facing the kind of hostility that is rampant
   in California and a few other places.  There is an
   opportunity there to say to members of Congress
   from those states like Wyoming and others, we don't
   want those politicans jumping on this bandwagon, we
    don't want them pandering to the racist instincts
    that drive a lot of this, we don't want them
    attacking civil rights and civil liberties in the
    guise of immigration reform, as it is always
    called.
<P>               So I think we can take this threat that
    we have, and there is no doubt about it, but we can
    use it to build a broad coalition, and it is
    beginning to happen.  I think we have to work hard
   at it, but it is an opportunity, and I think that,
   just in closing, I think it is always useful,
   though, perhaps somewhat hackneyed, to remind
   ourselves that today's immigrants, regardless of
   their status, are tomorrow's poets, sports heroes,
   Nobel laureates --
<P>              <STRONG>VOICE:</STRONG>  Civil libertarians.<P>
              <STRONG>MR. GUTTENTAG:</STRONG>  -- civil libertarians,
   that's right.  Every immigrant group that comes to
   this country changes this country and is, in turn,
   changed by the country, and the results of
   immigration we are experiencing now is something we
   should celebrate, not be afraid of.
<P>              Immigration is a dynamic process, it is
   ongoing, continuing, it is not an historical
   artifact we look back at and see it as happening
    sometime back in the past, and in common times, as
    a country, we always look back and everybody looks
    back and said, oh, it was wrong to intern the
    Japanese-Americans, it was wrong not to accept Jews
    fleeing the Holocaust, it was wrong to repatriate
    Haitian refugees, it was wrong to deport persons
    because of their political beliefs.  But it is
    always after the fact.
<P>               In the meantime, when the policies are
   ongoing and happening, we have done untold damage
   to people's, lives, constitutional principles and
   our values as a nation.
<P>              I think the challenge for each of us is
   to recognize these policies as they are occurring,
   not after the fact.  That's what the ACLU has been
   doing for 75 years, that's what we have to continue
   to do in every state, in every capital, and in
   every community throughout the country.  Thank
   you.
<P>             <STRONG> (Applause.)</STRONG><P>
              <STRONG>MS. RIPSTON</STRONG>:  Because everyone on this
   panel stayed within the allotted time given to each
   of us, we have time, we do have time, if there are
   any, for several questions.
<P>              <STRONG>VOICE:</STRONG>  Thank you very much to members
    of the panel.  I have to say at the outset, as a
    personal matter, as a matter of policy, I would
    accept open borders, so that is the spirit from
    which this question comes.
<P>               Valerie, I did not understand the civil
    liberties rationale for the ACLU opposing the
    distinction between legal and illegal immigrants,
    and it would be very helpful to me in my advocacy
    efforts if either you or Ira also emphasize that
   our advocacy has to be in the framework of civil
   liberties, if you could articulate that.
<P>             <STRONG> MS. SMALL-NAVARO:</STRONG>  I will give it a
   shot.  I think Ira did it best when he started his
   talk, and I think that it is that immigration is
   just the context within which we fight for civil
   liberties or that those civil liberties are being
   attacked.  So it's the First Amendment, when we
   throw people out of the country for having
   political opinions that we don't agree with.  You
   know, it's those kinds of things.  It is the
   context within which the civil liberties come up.
<P>              <STRONG>VOICE:</STRONG>  The fact that somebody has
   committed a crime would be relevant in the First
   Amendment analysis, wouldn't it?  I am asking you
   why we don't buy into the distinction between legal
    or illegal, or documented or undocumented.
<P>               <STRONG>MS. SMALL-NAVARO:</STRONG>  Maybe I should back
    up on immigration law, and I don't know if Ira
    wants to answer, but just jump in here.
<P>               Coming to the country illegally, when
 you are passing over the border, that's a crime.
    Once you are in this country, that is not a crime,
    that's a civil wrong.  That's why we don't have
    police officers enforcing our immigration laws.  It
   is a civil problem.  So why do I say undocumented
   people are entitled to civil liberties?  That is
   because I am taking the point of view that human
   rights are civil liberties, or maybe I should say
   that the other way around.  And that's why, I
   think, it's so important that we don't allow civil
   liberties of individuals to be addressed
   differently just because of their immigration
   status.
<P>              Does somebody want to take a stab at
   that?  That's how I look at it.  I don't know if I
   am articulating a greater vision, but that's what I
   am seeing.
<P>              <STRONG>MR. GUTTENTAG: </STRONG> Let me just add one
   thing to that, and that is, what we are talking
   about is the Constitution, and remember what the
    Constitution talks about is persons.  When we talk
    about defending civil liberties and civil rights,
    we are talking about persons, all persons,
    regardless of immigration status, and that is
    really the principle that is at issue here, if
    somebody because of their status can be made a
    nonperson under the law, and that's what a lot of
    these proposals talk about, to render a person less
    than a full person because of their immigration
   status.
<P>              Can they be deported if they are
   undocumented?  Of course they can.  There is a
   procedure for doing that.  But that procedure has
   to be fair, it has to be performed with due
   process, it cannot be discriminatory, when the
   Immigration Service arrests people, they have to
   comply with the same principle as any other
   agency.  These are the constitutional principles
   that are no different.  The fact that a person is
   at the border of the United States should not allow
   Congress to say, therefore, they are not here,
   technically, and we can do anything we want with
   them.  We have had people in jails and prisons in
   this country for over 10 years because they are
   treated as nonpersons under the law, because the
    Supreme Court has said, well, they were arrested
    when they arrived, and they have never entered, so
    therefore, they have no rights at all.
<P>               Those are the kinds of issues that we
    have to focus on.
<P>               <STRONG>MR. GLASSER:</STRONG>  Let me just add one more
    concrete way of looking at this.
<P>               We believe, as a matter of civil
    liberties, that the Bill of Rights is a limit on
   the government's power.  This is irrespective of
   the target of that power.  We would not want to
   take the position that if somebody is arrested, if
   somebody is occupying an apartment -- and the
   question arises as to whether or not a cop can
   enter that apartment with or without probable
   cause, with or without a search warrant, that that
   has to depend on what the immigration status is,
   or, for example, what the parole status is.  There
   have been -- we have litigated that very kind of
   issue with respect to people on parole.
<P>              The question has to be that the cop
   cannot decide whether or not he can enter that
   apartment without a warrant, as a violation of the
   14th Amendment unless somebody first shows papers
   that they are a citizen.  Once they are here, how
    they got here has to become irrelevant, or else
    cops get to beat people on the street if they are
    not citizens in a way they cannot if they are
    citizens.  I think if somebody is arrested for
    distributing a leaflet, is the First Amendment less
    powerful than the --
<P>               <STRONG>VOICE:</STRONG>  I am sorry, I was not clear, I
    totally agree with you.  The welfare benefits, that
    we don't have a right to welfare benefits, so if
   the government uses as a cut-off that you have
   violated the law for entering the country, what is
   the civil liberties reason for saying that is not a
   valid distinction?
<P>             <STRONG> MR. GLASSER:</STRONG>  Because violating the law
   is not part of the eligibility requirements.  We do
   not argue that people have a right, even as
   citizens, we don't argue that citizens have a
   constitutional right to welfare.  We don't argue
   that citizens have a constitutional right to
   Medicaid.
   <P>           But we do argue that once the government
   establishes those programs, it may not distinguish
   between who gets them and who doesn't get them by
   irrelevant and suspect categories.  If somebody
   commits a crime, if somebody commits a crime in one
    area, it does not mean they lose their
    constitutional rights in the other area.  We have
    resisted that all through our existence.
<P>               I don't think the question of welfare,
    which I think, as I said, is a very tiny question,
    ought to drive the general debate, in any case, of
    whether or not people who are here without citizen
    status or green card status, have any fewer rights
    against government power than otherwise.  The
   Constitution gets muddy when you talk about
   welfare, but if somebody had the right, for
   example, to medical treatment, would you not pick
   them up off the street if they were bleeding until
   you saw their papers?  It is simply as a way of
   practice.  What would happen if anything contrary
   to that developed?
<P>              It is the same thing that happens in
   employment.  People would be denied services
   because of a Spanish surname, people would be
   denied of services because of the way they look,
   and because of practice, the government official
   would have no way to tell, and it would necessarily
   be overboard.  The distinction cannot exist because
   the distinction cannot easily be made, and that is
   part of the problem.
<P>         

               <STRONG>MS. RIPSTON:</STRONG>  I would also like to add,
    that while it only pertained to children and
    education, in Iowa, the United States Supreme Court
    did recognize that undocumented children are
    entitled to some rights.  If there were a different
    Supreme Court, it might be willing to expand on
    that a little.
 <P>              <STRONG>VOICE:</STRONG>  Well, this -- Ira sort of
    covered a lot of my point, I was going to address
   Nadine's point.  I was going to add that the 14th
   Amendment clearly states once you are within the
   jurisdiction of the state, any person within that
   jurisdiction is afforded the protections of that
   state under the law.
<P>              I also think Nadine's question brings up
   a serious point.  In California, about a year
   before the 187 debacle started to brew up, we ran
   an article in our newsletter about immigrants and
   about how they are becoming the official scapegoat
   in the State of California, and we got a
   significant amount of mail, a significant amount of
   angry mail from our own members saying, how can you
   take this position, and illegal immigrants are
   criminals, et cetera.
<P>              And I think this point really needs to
    be stressed to the membership of every affiliate.
    We are here and this is a very good time to reach
    out to all of the members and do some serious
    education on this point, because it is a
    distinction that is often blurred, often fudged
    over, saying, we don't support that, we only
    support legal immigrants.  I think, as an
    organization, we need to take a very strong stand
    along those lines.
<P>             <STRONG> MS. RIPSTON:</STRONG>  I want to thank you all
   for coming to this plenary.
<P>              <STRONG>VOICE:</STRONG>  One more observation.  I should
   point out that our enemies are having no trouble
   not making that distinction.  They are in the
   process of taking benefits away from all
   immigrants, legal or illegal, and I don't see any
   reason why we need to observe a distinction without
   a difference of that nature.
<P>              <STRONG>MS. RIPSTON: </STRONG> Thank you all for coming
   to this last plenary.  We are going to take a
   two-minute stretch.

<blockquote>
<I>"Americans are not a narrow tribe.  Our blood is as the flood of the Amazon, made up of a thousand noble currents all pouring into one."</i><br> 
<b>Herman Melville</b>
<P>
The United States is in the midst of a major debate over immigrants and their place in our economic and political life.  As during other times in our history, immigrants are being blamed for causing or contributing to the social, economic and political ills of our society.  Politicians from both major parties,  at both the national and state levels, are promoting a range of punitive legislative proposals that single out immigrants for adverse treatment by the government.  Many violate basic civil liberties principles.
<p>
The Bill of Rights does not grant foreigners the right to enter the United States, but once here, immigrants are entitled to certain broad constitutional protections.  Due Process -- the right to be treated fairly, whether in a deportation hearing or a criminal court proceeding -- applies to every person within U.S. borders.  And Equal Protection prohibits discrimination based on race or national origin.   An alien's rights to free speech and religious freedom are protected under the First Amendment.   The Refugee Act of 1980 gives certain aliens the right to political asylum in the U.S. 
<P>
New immigrants to our country are not a scourge as some politicians claim.  In fact, they can help solve many of our economic and social problems.  
<P>

<i>"Few decisions are more personal and intimate, more properly private, or more basic to individual dignity and autonomy, than a woman's decision whether to end her pregnancy.  A woman's right to make that choice freely is fundamental."</i><b>  <br>Justice Harry A. Blackmun, <i>Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists</i> (1986)</b>
<p>
The right to decide whether or not to bear a child was secured in 1973 by the U.S. Supreme Courts decision in Roe v. Wade.  But before the ink was dry, anti-abortion activists began a campaign to overturn this landmark civil liberties decision.  Through a campaign of  restrictive legislation, harassment of abortion clinics and providers, and mounting violence, the anti-choice movement continues to pose a threat to women's reproductive freedom.
<p>
 Today, in 84% of the counties of the U.S., not a single physician is willing to provide abortion services.  Between 1977 and 1994, more than 2,500 bombings, arsons, blockades and episodes of vandalism took place at abortion clinics.  And restrictive measures like bans on public funding, parental involvement laws for minors and biased counseling laws have been adopted in many states.
<p>
Protecting women's right to reproductive freedom requires constant vigilance.

<center><h1>Joycelyn Elders' Speech<br></h1>
<h2>"Nothing Kills Lies Faster Than the Truth"</center></h2>
<blockquote>
From the Madison (WI) Times<br>
  July 6, 1995<br>
  Joycelyn Elders to ACLU Assembly:<br>
  "Nothing Kills Lies Faster than the Truth"
<p>
  By John Quinlan
<p>
  New York--Speaking to hundreds of activists from around the country at the
75th   Anniversary Biennial Conference of the American Civil Liberties Union
in late June,   Former U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was emphatic in
defending her record in   the face of the right-wing critics who had
succeeded in driving her from office.   "I loved   being your surgeon
general, and ... I did the very best job that I knew how to do.  And I   want
to tell you that if I had it to do all over again, knowing everything I know,
starting   today, I would do exactly the same things."
<p>
  At hearing this, the crowd, which included about a dozen representatives
from Wisconsin,   rose to its feet with applause and shouts of affirmation.
In an interview for the Madison   Times that followed her speech, Elders, who
had been forced out of office last December   allegedly because of remarks
that advocated masturbation as an acceptable sexual outlet   for teens,
exuded optimism despite the challenges presented by the current political
climate.
<p>
  "I think we have to have optimism," Dr. Elders said.  "We'll be moving
ahead again as   soon as we make the American society understand what the
problems are.  We are letting   the politicians draw the boundaries now...." 
<p>
  "As soon as we allow all of our people to understand what the whole of the
issues are,   rather than just understanding what the politicians want them
to know, then I think that   we'll be looking at a very different society,"
she said.  "You see, the politicians take the   facts that they want to use
to make them look good, to benefit themselves, and that's what   they use.
Whereas, if you're a scientist or a physician like myself, you have to use
all of   the facts."
<p>
  "I think that the people who are doing this know that they are stretching
the truth," she   added.  "And one of the things that we have to know is that
if we keep speaking the truth,   nothing kills lies faster than the truth." 
<p>
  When asked to respond to the assertions of her critics that her stands on
civil rights and   family planning issues are somehow immoral and
anti-religious, she was unequivocal.  "I   feel that I'm very much a person
of faith," she said.  "And I feel that many of the people   who are saying
that they are people of faith, they are actually the same people who were
very much involved against Blacks, they are the most  homophobic--they are
against gays   and lesbians--they believe that men are the heads of their
households and that women   have no rights.  They're the same people who have
used religion to justify these views all   through history..."
<p>
  "I think that most people who really are true believers in faith believe in
the civil liberties   of others and that God loves all of us equally," she
added.  "He didn't give one special   privileges and take away those
privileges from others.  I really feel that with many of   these people, it's
not about God, I feel that they're 'religious economists.'  They are really
using religion to raise money.  And that's what it's about--other agendas." 
<p>
  Asked specifically about critics who claimed late last year that she was
advocating   detailed "how-to" courses on masturbation and other sexual
practices in the public   schools, Dr. Elders reiterated her belief that her
critics don't have the first idea what   health and sex education are all
about.  "I don't think it's necessarily important to be that   explicit.  I
feel that God gave us the know-how and desires and all of that.  And nobody
needs to be taught how-to courses.  That's not what it's about."
<p>
  "What it's really about is being able to have the facts and being able to
make the   judgements and make the decisions," she said.  "That's what
sexuality is all about.  More   goes on above the neck than goes on below the
belt.  And so we can get off into all of   these details about how-to, but
that is never a part of the human sexuality courses that are   being taught.
Nobody needs to be taught how-to."
<p>
  Given the rising rates of pregnancy and incidence of sexually transmitted
diseases,   teenagers need to hear frank discussions about sexual outlets
that are alternatives to   intercourse, she said.  And masturbation is one of
those options.
<p>
  "I think that America was talking more about masturbation in December of
1994 than   they ever talked about masturbation before, and that now it's all
right to say masturbation,   and before we didn't know that it was all
right," she said.
<p>
  "It is an alternative.  Now teenagers know that they're not going to go
blind, they're not   going to go crazy.  Hair's not going to grow on their
hands.  We need to just stop lying to   our children."
<p>
  In her speech, Elders drove home repeatedly the notion that those who label
themselves   as pro-family, who preach about the need for welfare reform and
who oppose a woman's   right to choose,  seldom have a record of working to
improve the lives of the nation's   children in poor families.
<p>
   "We know in our society that 60 per cent of the children born in America
are   unplanned," she said.  "We have the resources, we have the know-how to
make a   difference.  But we've not yet made a commitment to get it done.  We
have allowed those   men in Washington to use women's uteruses to get
elected.  So let's stop letting them hide   behind our uteruses.  You know
and I know that they aren't concerned about poor   children. All these rules
and all these laws that are curbing welfare and in terms of   medicare.  Who
do you think they're affecting?"
<p>
  "If any of you in this room wanted to get an abortion, you might have to do
without a new   coat this winter, but you could get it.  They affect the
young, the poor, and the   uneducated."
<p>
  "And if we are going to try to make a difference, we have got to be the
power brokers for   the powerless."
<p>
  These so-called pro-family politicians must be made accountable for their
scuttling of   health care reform, she asserted.  "We are one of two
industrialized countries that do not   have health care for all--universal
access to health care--the United States and South   Africa.  We spend 14 per
cent of our gross domestic product on health care.  The problem   is we don't
spend it on health care, we spend it on very expensive sick care."
<p>
  "We spend less than one per cent of our health care budget on keeping
people healthy--things like immunization, like pre-natal care.  But these
have all been defined as 'women's   issues.'  How many men do you know who
feel they have a stake in good pre-natal care?"
<p>
  "We have a health illiterate society.  People say, well let the parents
teach it.  But the   parents don't know how to teach it.  Forty-five per cent
of our fifth and sixth graders say   that there is more fat in watermelon
than there is in cheese.  And so we're putting all of   these labels on food,
but if we don't know what they mean, what good are they?"
<p>
  "And we feel that we don't want to educate our society, because if we start
educating our   children (about health issues), then we might teach them
something about sex.  Well   somebody needs to teach them something about
sex."  The crowd rose once again to its   feet to applaud.
<p>
  "When you have the highest teenage birth rate, pregnancy rate, and abortion
rate in the   industrialized world, we need to prevent unplanned pregnancy.
It's not about 'reforming'   welfare systems, which really means finding ways
not to care for unplanned children.  If   we began to put good health
education in place, if we began to put good services for    young people in
place, well then we can talk about reforming welfare."
<p>
  "We need to make every child born in America a planned and wanted child."
<p>
  "And about abortion--I've never been about abortion.  I support a woman's
right to choice.    I don't know anybody who knows enough to define for
another woman--I don't know   anybody who's good enough even if they knew
enough to make that choice for her....  It's   a decision between a woman,
her doctor, her significant other, and her God.  And it's not   for the
politicians in Washington to decide."
<p>
  Elders returned to her criticism of people who are anti-abortion but show
little evidence   of working to improve the lives of unwanted children.  "If
you're going to have a love   affair with the fetus, then you'd better be out
there fighting for programs for children.    Have you heard these people
fighting for real reform in welfare?  Have you seen them out   there fighting
for health care?  Have you seen them out there fighting for early childhood
education for all children?  Maybe they do it in your state, they don't do it
in mine." 
<p>
  Too often, the challenge is expressed in terms of  single teenage mothers.
Young men   must also be educated about their responsibilities, she said. "We
must teach our young   men to be responsible," she said.  Elders advocated
putting the child's father's social   security number on their child's birth
certificate, and automatically taking at least17 per   cent of any of their
earnings for the benefit of their child.  "I say that two parents are
responsible, not just one."
<p>
  Elders says that when she becomes discouraged, she remembers a woman from
Alaska   who offered these words of encouragement: "One woman with courage
can make a   difference."
<p>
  And, in noting the longterm nature of the battle for civil rights, she
related the advice her   bishop once gave her. "The things that you're
fighting for are like dancing with a bear,"   he told her.  "And when you're
dancing with a bear, you can't get tired and sit down.  You   have to wait
until the bear gets tired.  And then...you sit down."
<p>
  Throughout her speech, Elders--who has been ubiquitous in the national
media in recent   weeks in rallying people behind the cause of civil
rights--made it clear that she isn't about   to stop dancing with the bear.
As to what the future holds for her, however, Elders, who   never sought the
limelight, paints a picture of a much simpler existence.
<p>
   "I'll probably be home in a garden raising flowers five years from now,"
she said.  "I now   look forward to going home and doing just that."

(1993) and <I>Miller v. Johnson</I> (1995).  <I>Shaw</I> held for the first
time that white residents could challenge a redistricting plan under the
Fourteenth Amendment on the grounds that a district's shape was so bizarre that
it could only be understood as an attempt to segregate voters on the basis of
race.  Prior to <I>Shaw</I>, the Court had held that a compact district shape,
while frequently required by state law, was not an independent federal
constitutional requirement.</P>
<P>Two years later in <I>Miller</I> the Court went far beyond what it had said
in <I>Shaw</I>, i.e., that only bizarrely shaped districts were problematical,
and held that a district could be challenged, regardless of its shape, if race
was the predominant factor in the redistricting process and if the jurisdiction
subordinated its traditional districting principles to race.  </P>
<P><I>Shaw</I> and <I>Miller</I> have spawned a host of lawsuits challenging
majority minority districts.  At the congressional level, <I>Shaw</I>/<I>Miller</I>
challenges have been filed in North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Texas,
Louisiana, Florida, New York, Illinois, and South Carolina.  Thus far, majority
minority congressional districts have been invalidated in North Carolina (2),
Georgia (2), Texas (3), Louisiana (1), and Florida (1).  <I>Shaw</I>/<I>Miller</I>
challenges have also been made to a number of legislative and local
redistricting plans, including in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Colorado, California, and Alabama.    </P>
<P>In <I>Thornburg v. Gingles</I> (1986), the Supreme Court established a
three part test for determining when the Voting Rights Act required the creation
of majority minority districts.  Plaintiffs were normally entitled to relief if
they established that the minority was geographically compact, i.e., that it
could constitute a majority in one or more districts, that it was politically
cohesive, i.e., that it voted as a bloc, and that the majority voted
sufficiently as a bloc usually to defeat the candidates favored by the minority.
 The essence of the ruling in <I>Gingles</I> was that majority minority
districts were necessary where racial bloc voting by whites effectively deprived
blacks and other minorities of an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their
choice.</P>
<P>Under the guiding principles of <I>Gingles</I> and the Section 5
preclearance process, the 1990 redistricting, from the point of view of
minorities, was the most successful in the Nation's history.  Sixteen new
majority minority congressional districts were created in Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Maryland, New York,
Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and Texas.  There were similar increases in the number
of majority minority districts for the election of state senators, house
members, county commissioners, school board members, and city council members. 
 </P>
<P>The destruction of majority minority districts under the new rules
established by <I>Shaw</I> and <I>Miller</I> threatens to roll back the gains
in minority office holding accumulated over the past 30 years since passage of
the Voting Rights Act.  Prior to passage of the Act in 1965, there were fewer
than one hundred black elected officials in the seven Deep South states targeted
by the special preclearance provisions found in Section 5 of the Act.  Today,
the number of black elected officials in these states is more than 4,000.  There
is a general consensus that this dramatic increase in minority office holding is
linked directly to the increase in the number of majority minority electoral
districts created as a result of the Voting Rights Act.  Prior to the 1996
elections, for example, only one black had ever been elected to Congress from
the Deep South states from a majority white district.  Andrew Young was elected
in 1972 from the Fifth Congressional District in Georgia, which had a 44% black
voting age population.  Still, voting was racially polarized and he got only 25%
of the white vote.  When he ran for mayor of Atlanta in 1981 he got only 9% of
the white vote.  In 1990 he ran for governor, getting about a quarter of the
white vote, and was defeated.  Even for a candidate with extraordinary
qualifications, such as Young, racial bloc voting is a political fact of life. 
 </P>
<H3><A NAME="IA"></A>A.  The Role of the Voting Rights Project</H3>
<P>The Voting Rights Project has sought to represent citizen intervenors in as
many of the <I>Shaw</I>/<I>Miller</I> challenges as its resources have
permitted.  Such intervention is crucial, for the Southern states, as noted
below, cannot be counted on vigorously to defend the Voting Rights Act or the
plans they adopted after the 1990 census.</P>
<P>In Georgia, we have represented a group of black and white voters in the
ongoing challenge to the state's congressional redistricting (<I>Miller v.
Johnson</I>).  On remand from the Supreme Court, the district court allowed the
plaintiffs to amend their complaint to challenge the constitutionality of
Georgia's majority black Second Congressional District.  The state did not
attempt to defend the district but conceded that it was unconstitutional.</P>
<P>The governor called the general assembly into special session to adopt a new
plan, but it was unable to do so.  Accordingly, the district court adopted a
plan, which was used in the 1996 election.  Although the first plan enacted by
the state prior to any involvement by the Department of Justice contained two
majority black districts, the plan drawn by the district court contained only
one such district, the Fifth District in the Atlanta metropolitan area
represented by John Lewis.  </P>
<P>The state declined to appeal the decision of the district court, despite the
fact that the court's plan abolished two of the three majority black districts
drawn by the state in 1992.  The intervenors (including the United States)
appealed.  In a total reversal of roles, the state joined the plaintiffs and
have opposed the appeal.</P>
<P>We contend that the district court's plan violates the Voting Rights Act and
that the court abused its powers by ignoring the state's policy choices for the
location and racial composition of the Eleventh District.  The Supreme Court
heard oral argument on December 9, 1996 (<I>Abrams v. Johnson</I>).</P>
<P>We also represent intervenors in a <I>Shaw</I>/<I>Miller</I> challenge to
house and senate redistricting in Georgia (<I>Johnson III</I>).  The three
judge court granted the plaintiffs partial relief following a trial on
plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.  Since then we have had several
settlement discussions with the plaintiffs and there is a possibility that we
can settle all or most of the litigation in a way that minimizes the destruction
of majority black house and senate districts.      </P>
<P>We represent black intervenors in <I>Shaw</I>/<I>Miller</I> challenges to
house and senate redistricting in South Carolina (<I>Smith v. Beasley</I>; <I>Able

v. Wilkins</I>).  The plaintiffs challenged nine house districts and three
senate districts.  The court invalidated six of the nine house districts and in
a split decision all three of the senate districts.  However, the court gave the
legislature an opportunity to redraw the lines, and it is possible that some or
most of the districts will be redrawn as majority black districts and in a
manner that is acceptable to our clients.</P>
<P>Although we hope that an appeal will ultimately be unnecessary, the
intervenors filed a protective notice of appeal.  We have also asked the Supreme
Court to delay consideration of the appeal until after the state adopts new
plans.  As in Georgia, the state declined to appeal the decision of the district
court.    </P>
<P>In a recent development, a <I>Shaw</I>/<I>Miller</I> challenge was filed
in early December, 1996 against the sole majority black congressional district
in South Carolina, currently represented by James Clyburn (<I>Leonard v.
Beasley</I>).  We have been asked to represent minority intervenors who wish to
defend the district, and will file the necessary intervention papers within the
next few weeks.  Clyburn is the only black in modern times to be elected to
Congress from South Carolina.  Given the levels of racial bloc voting in the
state, the creation of all majority white congressional districts would almost
certainly eventually lead to an all white congressional delegation. </P>
<P>As a footnote, the house, senate, and congressional districts in South
Carolina that are now under challenge were created as a result of litigation
brought by the Voting Rights Project in 1991 (<I>SRAC v. Campbell</I>; <I>SRAC
v. Theodore</I>).  The Republican Party brought a similar suit and the two cases
were consolidated for trial.  Thus, we have an added incentive to defend the
challenged plans in South Carolina.   </P>
<P>We are also representing intervenors in a <I>Shaw</I>/<I>Miller</I>
challenge to congressional redistricting in Virginia (<I>Moon v. Meadows</I>). 
The case has been tried and we are awaiting a decision.  Even if the court
invalidates the existing district, there is a chance that it would be redrawn to
save it as a majority black district.  In any event, the incumbent Bobby Scott
would probably survive under any likely remedial scenario.  The bigger question,
of course, is the probability of a non-incumbent black being elected in a
reconfigured district. </P>
<P>We have also defended three consent decrees we entered into against <I>Shaw</I>/<I>Miller</I>
challenges.  We were able to postpone the challenge in Perry County, Mississippi
(<I>McCarty v. Board of Supervisors</I>) until after the next census.  Another
challenge in St. Francisville, Louisiana (<I>Wilson v. Mayor and Board of
Aldermen</I>) we won after a trial on the merits.  The court invalidated the
challenged district as bizarre but implemented as a court ordered plan the
majority black district our expert had originally drawn.  The court ordered
district is actually a stronger black district than the one contained in the
consent order.  </P>
<P>The third consent decree involves residents of the Ute Mountain Ute Indian
Reservation in Colorado (<I>Cuthair v. Montezuma-Cortez</I>).  The district
court rejected the <I>Shaw</I>/<I>Miller</I> challenge filed by the defendant
school board to a decree creating a majority Indian district on the grounds that
the district was regular in shape and did not subordinate traditional
redistricting principles.  (We argued that <I>Shaw</I>/<I>Miller</I> did not
apply to Native Americans in the first place since &quot;Indian,&quot; for
purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, is a political rather than a racial
category.)  The court, however, set aside the consent decree (wrongly in our
view) on other unrelated grounds and has set the case for a trial on the merits
in May, 1997.</P>
<P>In addition to direct representation, we have filed amicus briefs in the
Supreme Court in support of the minority intervenors and the United States in
other <I>Shaw</I>/<I>Miller</I> cases, i.e., <I>Shaw v. Hunt</I> (North
Carolina congressional), and <I>United States v. Hays</I> (Louisiana
congressional).  The director of the Voting Rights Project has also written
several articles as part of an ongoing public education campaign, and to address
and hopefully dispel some of the misconceptions surrounding redistricting and
minority voting rights.  See, L. McDonald, &quot;Can Minority Voting Rights
Survive <I>Miller v. Johnson</I>?&quot; 1 Mich. J. R &amp; L 1190 (1996); L.
McDonald, &quot;The Counterrevolution in Minority Voting Rights,&quot; 65 Miss.
L. J. 271 (1995); L. McDonald, &quot;<I>Holder v. Hall</I>: Blinking at
Minority Voting Rights,&quot; 3 D.C. L. Rev. 61 (1995); L. McDonald, &quot;This
Way?  Voting Rights at a Crossroads,&quot; 1 Civ. R. J. 36 (1995).</P>
<H3><A NAME="IB"></A>B.  Exercising Damage Control</H3>
<P>Given the hostility of the Court to all forms of perceived affirmative
action, the Voting Rights Project has tried to exercise as much damage control
as possible and defend the gains of the 1990 redistricting process.  We (and the
civil rights community in general) have been fairly successful thus far in
stemming the erosion of minority office holders.  At the congressional level,
despite the invalidation of redistricting plans in Georgia, North Carolina,
Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, all the black incumbents, with the exception of
Cleo Fields who did not seek reelection, were returned to office.  </P>
<P>We still don't know the impact of <I>Shaw</I>/<I>Miller</I> on legislative
redistricting in South Carolina and Georgia, but thus far no black incumbents
have lost their seats as a result of the litigation.  We certainly lost some of
the legal battles during the past year, and the work of the project has been
made more difficult as a result.  But the worst predictions of &quot;political
ethnic cleansing&quot; have not yet come to pass.  </P>
<H3><A NAME="IC"></A>C.  Are Majority Minority Districts Still Needed?</H3>
<P>With the election of Cynthia McKinney and Sanford Bishop to Congress in 1996
from Georgia in newly configured majority white districts, some critics have
argued that majority black districts are no longer needed.  Of course, similar
arguments were made in 1972 after Andy Young was elected.  Whether or not
minorities have equal electoral opportunities cannot, however, be determined on
the basis of one or a few elections.  The exceptions cannot be used to establish
the rule.  Instead, voting patterns over time have to be examined to determine
whether minorities in fact have the equal opportunity to elect candidates of
their choice.  </P>
<P>McKinney and Bishop were able to win in large measure because they ran with
the advantages of incumbency.  And they were incumbents because they were
elected in the first place in majority black districts.  They were therefore
able to establish track records of service to both their white and black
constituents.  By contrast, non-incumbent blacks who ran for Congress in 1996 in
majority white districts in Arkansas, Texas, and Mississippi all lost.</P>
<P>The voting in Georgia in the 1996 elections was still considerably
polarized.  In the 1996 Democratic primary, McKinney got only 13% of the white
vote.  She won the nomination because she got almost all the black vote and
whites mainly stayed home or voted in the Republican primary.  White turnout was
only 11% of registered voters compared to 31% for blacks.  As a consequence, the
electorate in the primary was actually substantially majority black.  In the
general election, running in a heavily Democratic district she increased her
percentage of the white vote, but voting was still along racial lines--100% of
blacks voted for McKinney while 69% of whites voted for her white opponent. 
</P>
<P>The real test of the new majority white districts, such as the Fourth
represented by McKinney, will come when non-incumbent blacks run for office. 
Hopefully, McKinney's election is a bellwether of a gradual change in voter
attitudes.  But in the meantime, the notion that racial bloc voting does not
exist should be seen for what it is, a myth.  </P>
<P>If the electorate were truly color blind we would expect to see a few black
governors, U.S. Senators, secretaries of state, commissioners of agriculture,
etc.  In fact, except for judicial office, not a single black holds a statewide
elected position in any of the southern states.  </P>
<P>The critics have charged that majority minority districts were &quot;segregated,&quot;
and would polarize the electorate and create racial tensions.  To the contrary,
the majority minority districts created after the 1990 census were the most
integrated districts in the country, containing an average of 45% of white
voters.  </P>
<P>As for polarization and racial tensions, the 1996 elections do not support
the critics' dire predictions.  The election returns show that the highly
integrated majority minority districts have helped break down to some extent
racial polarization.  Far from balkanizing the electorate, they have helped
reduce harmful stereotyping of minority candidates and reassured white voters
that their interests could be adequately represented by black office holders. 
Highly integrated majority minority districts have benefitted voters of all
races.   </P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="II"></A>II.  Section 2 and Constitutional Litigation </H3>
<P>A judicial backlash in the area of voting following <I>Shaw</I> and <I>Miller</I>
is undeniable.  Following a trial this summer, the court ruled against us on our
claim that Georgia's majority vote law was enacted in 1964 to discriminate
against blacks (<I>Brooks v. Miller</I>).  The court simply &quot;found&quot;
the evidence against us.  The court also rejected our Section 2 challenge to
at-large elections in Rome, Georgia despite strong evidence of vote dilution (<I>Askew
v. Rome</I>).  The court of appeals affirmed the granting of summary judgment to
the defendants in Alamance, North Carolina and adopted a new rule that
black/white contests are not controlling and that blacks would enjoy equal
political opportunities even if the only candidates they could elect were white
(<I>Lewis v. Board of Commissioner</I>). </P>
<P>In spite of these setbacks -- all of which we are appealing -- we have been
able to make progress on a number of fronts.</P>
<H3><A NAME="IIA"></A>A.  Motor Voter</H3>
<P>Our motor voter litigation in Kansas (<I>League of Women Voters v. Graves</I>),
Louisiana (<I>ACORN v. Fowler</I>), Virginia (<I>Richmond Crusade for Voters
v. Allen</I>), and South Carolina (<I>Grass Roots Leadership v. Beasley</I>),
was all resolved satisfactorily on the merits.  As a result, thousands of new
voters have been added to the voter rolls in the affected states.</P>
<P>The NVRA litigation in Mississippi (<I>Young v. Fordice</I>), which we are
participating in with the Lawyers' Committee, is ongoing.  The issue is whether
the state's attempt to revert to a dual system of registration, requiring
separate registration for state and federal elections, is subject to
preclearance under Section 5.  If we prevail on this issue and the changes are
submitted, we believe they would violate the retrogression principle of Section
5.  Minorities would be clearly worse off having to register twice, once to vote
in state elections and again to vote in federal elections.  Aside from the
expense of maintaining dual registration, such a system would create voter
confusion and inevitably depress minority political participation. </P>
<P>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear our appeal in this case.  No date has
yet been set for oral argument.</P>
<H3><A NAME="IIB"></A>B.  Other Litigation</H3>
<P>We prevailed in a number of cases brought to enforce one person-one vote,
the results (or racial fairness) standard of Section 2, and the preclearance
requirement of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  </P>
<P>We won (for the second time) our challenge to at-large elections for judges
in Hamilton County, Tennessee (<I>Cousin v. McWherter</I>).  As a remedy, the
court implemented a system of cumulative voting.  The state has appealed; the
case has been briefed and is awaiting oral argument.   </P>
<P>We succeeded in changing the discriminatory annexation policy of Foley,
Alabama (<I>Dillard v. City of Foley</I>).  We prevailed in separate law suits
to require Hemingway, South Carolina and Douglasville, Georgia to submit for
Section 5 preclearance their annexations of predominantly white residential
areas (<I>NAACP v. Hemingway</I>; <I>Simpson v. City of Douglasville</I>).  
</P>
<P>We won a one person, one vote challenge in Cook County, Georgia that
resulted in the adoption of a new plan containing a majority black district and
a second strong minority &quot;influence&quot; district (<I>Jones v. Cook
County</I>).  A successful Section 2 law suit in Worcester County, Maryland
produced a new majority black district for the county commission (<I>Cane v.
Worcester County, Maryland</I>).  </P>
<P>Our Section 2 challenge in Thurston County, Nebraska resulted in the
creation of an additional majority Indian district for the county board of
supervisors (<I>Stabler v. County of Thurston</I>).  A similar suit in
Washington County, North Carolina produced two majority black districts for the
board of county commissioners (<I>Wilkins v. Board of Commissioners</I>).</P>
<P>One of the more imaginative consent decrees was entered in  the case
involving the board of education of Person County, North Carolina (<I>Webster
v. Board of Education</I>).  The parties agreed to adopt a system of plurality
voting to replace a staggered terms/majority vote method of elections.  The new
system will allow minorities to single shot vote (vote for less that all five
seats) and thus enhance their ability to elect candidates of their choice.  The
consent decree further provides that if minorities are unsuccessful in the 1996,
1998, and 2000 elections either party may apply to the court for further relief.
 The defendants agreed that under such circumstances they would not contest the
claim that the pre-existing at-large system violates Section 2.</P>
<P>We are awaiting a decision in our case challenging the county legislative
delegation system of county government in South Carolina (<I>Vander Linden v.
Campbell</I>).  The county legislative delegations, which have general powers of
county governance, are composed of members of the house and senate who have any
part of a county in their electoral districts.  As a result of having to split
counties to comply with one person-one vote in reapportioning the general
assembly, the delegations qua county governments are severely malapportioned. 
Some delegation members represent only a few county residents while other
members represent thousands of county residents.  </P>
<P>The district court has already granted our motion for a preliminary
injunction.  If we prevail on the merits, the state will have to restructure the
county legislative delegations to comply with equal population requirements, or
transfer the powers of the delegations to local governing bodies.  In either
case, county residents would have an equal voice in the election of public
officials.</P>

It is probably no accident that freedom of speech is the first freedom mentioned in the First Amendment:  Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  The Constitutions framers believed that freedom of inquiry and liberty of expression were the hallmarks of a democratic society.
<p>
But historically, at times of national stress -- real or imagined -- First Amendment rights come under enormous pressure.  During the Red Scare of the early 1920s, thousands were deported for their political views.  During the McCarthy period, the infamous blacklist ruined lives and careers.  Today, the creators, producers and distributers of popular culture are being blamed for the nations deep social problems.  Calls for censorship threaten to erode free speech.
<p>
The First Amendment exists precisely to protect the most offensive and controversial speech from government suppression.  The best way to counter obnoxious speech is with more speech.  Persuasion, not coercion, is the solution.

<h2>
<font color="#3300ff">First Amendment Shock:  
An Unusual Civil Liberties Story</font></h2>
<h4><font color="#ff0033"><i>
By Jean Carey Bond </i>    
</font>
</h4>
<p>&quot;Monolithic the African American community is not,&quot; said Attorney Anthony P. Griffin when Civil Liberties asked him what kinds of reactions,among black people particularly, had greeted his legal representation of a Ku Klux Klansman.  Indeed, the range of those reactions reconfirmed, if any reconfirmation was necessary, that the black community is just as complex and has just as broad a spectrum of attitudes, beliefs and myth-systems as do other communities in our diverse society.     
</p>
<p>The First Amendment on paper is one thing; the First Amendment in action is quite another.  When a person of unpopular viewpoints exercises his or her rights of free speech and association, the result can be, as Griffin puts it, &quot;shocking.&quot;  The defense of such a person can produces hock as well -- said Griffin: &quot;The combination of Klan, plus color, plus a history of violence, plus the ability of race to dominate a discussion,h as created shock, cheers, bravos and boos!&quot;      
</p>
<p>On the support side, the Black Heritage Committee of Galveston,Texas, at a function held last August attended by nearly 800 persons, gave Griffin its Citizen of the Year Award.  In presenting the award, the Committee cited his representation of the Klan, along with other work.     
</p>
<p>But hostility was also forthcoming: 
<blockquote>
<p>Immediately after the Houston Chronicle reported his defense of Klansman Lowe, under a headline that read &quot;Black Lawyer Giving His All to the Klan,&quot; Griffin was invited to appear on black radio stations in Chicago and Houston.  Out of about 100 call-ins to the talk shows on which he was a guest, fewer than fivecallers expressed support.     
</p>
<p>The Texas State Conference of the National Association for theAdvancement of Colored People (NAACP) was so incensed that it removed Griffin from his volunteer post as general counsel, claiming that his representation of both the NAACP's and the Klan's interests constituted a conflict of interest.  At the same time, at least five NAACP chapters in the state have continued to call Griffin, seeking legal advice.     In addition to dropping him as general counsel, seven members and officers of the Texas State Conference wrote to NAACP Executive Director Dr. Benjamin Chavis asking that Griffin's NAACP membership &quot;be immediately suspended ... until after a thorough investigation of his actions in defense of the Ku Klux Klan in court in Austin, Texas on September 29,1993 in the Texas commission on Human Rights vs. Michael Lowe, Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan.&quot; To date, Griffin has not heard from the national office regarding this request.     
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast to the NAACP, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) has offered Griffin membership.  While some lawyers at the Texas NAACP gathering where Griffin was removed as general counsel argued that the Constitution does not apply to the Klan, others questioned those attorneys' memory and sense of history.  And especially heartening for Griffin is the strong support he has received from persons responsible for training African American lawyers of the future, among them the dean of Howard University Law School.     As for the black people he encounters day to day, Griffin said this:     &quot;Walking through airports, walking down the streets, shopping in the stores, regular black folks, not carrying any notion or burden of the mantle of leadership, stop me, smile and extend a hand and express verbal support.
<p> 
Maybe this is because the First Amendment affects those who are poor, disenfranchised and powerless to a greater extent than those of us who are more fortunate, comfortable and whose everyday activities are not threatened by governmental restraint.&quot; Finally, Griffin said that whatever words his defense of a Klansman's rights has brought forth from African Americans -- whether disdain, the feeling that he has displayed courage or &quot;that I have lost my mind&quot; -- all of the responses are consistent with the intent of those who framed the First Amendment. &quot;The First Amendment,&quot; he said, &quot;makes us laugh, scream, cry, scratch our heads at the wonderful contradictions -- it crosses color, class and racial lines.&quot;     
</p>
<p>As the ACLU knows only too well, the work of any person involved in defending the Bill of Rights has a good chance of becoming the center of controversy, no matter what his or her ethnic or racial identity.  So be it.  Without our noticing it or expecting it, freedoms hard won can slipaway unless we continue the fight for their preservation on every front.

<H2>Protecting the Freedom to Believe</H2>
<P>Can a town council place a menorah display in the courthouse square?  Should
schools be allowed to hold Christmas parties that exclude children of other
faiths?  More widely, should our government directly fund religious
institutions, including parochial schools, or sponsor school prayer?   </P>
<P>The approaching holiday season, and the perennial controversy it stirs up
about the role of religion in public life, provides a good occasion to reflect
on these questions and on how the Constitution and Bill of Rights protects the
rights of all religions.</P>
<P>The ACLU believes that religious liberty -- the right of each and every
American to practice his or her own religion, or no religion at all -- is among
the most fundamental of the freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.</P>
<P>Americans enjoy a degree of religious freedom unknown in most of the rest of
the world, and they take full advantage it: The United States is home to more
than 1,500 different religious bodies (including 75 varieties of Baptists) and
360,000 churches, synagogues and mosques. Ninety per cent of Americans believe
in God; more than half say they pray at least once a day, and church membership
has remained at the same level -- 63 percent of the population, according to the
Census Bureau -- for more than thirty years.  </P>
<P>Yet assaults on the freedom to believe continue, both in Washington and in
state legislatures around the country.  While the 104th Congress was
unsuccessful in fulfilling its pledge to the Christian Coalition and others to
introduce constitutional amendments that would overturn the religion clauses of
the Bill of Rights, we can expect to see a renewed push for these initiatives in
the New Year.  </P>
<P>The 105th Congress is expected to introduce of a number of bills early in
1997, including constitutional amendments allowing school prayer and direct
government funding of religious institutions.  A constitutional amendment must
pass both Houses of Congress by a two-thirds majority in order to be sent to the
states for ratification, and a vote will likely come down to the wire in both
Houses.  The newly configured Senate, more conservative than in recent years,
cannot be counted on to head off the attack.  In fact, one new Senator, Jeff
Sessions of Alabama, has pledged to make the dismantling of church-state
separation his top priority. </P>
<P>Also in 1997, lawmakers will attempt to chip away at the separation of
church and state through the passage of statutes.  The most notorious of these
is the &quot;Community Renewal Act&quot; (CRA), a two-pronged attack on the
First Amendment.  </P>
<P>The so-called renewal act would rewrite our nation's laws on substance abuse
treatment to permit government- funded proselytizing and religious
indoctrination in substance abuse programs.  In other words, if a person seeks
treatment for a drug problem through a government program, he or she could be
sent to a religious program which could explicitly require the person to engage
in religious worship &#150; all with government dollars!  The bill would also
mandate a parochial school voucher scheme in 100 communities across the country,
and condition community funding on the institution of a program to funnel
taxpayer dollars for tuition to parochial schools.  Speaker Gingrich has
promised a vote on the CRA early in the 105th Congress.  </P>
<P>The ACLU will continue working to ensure that religious liberty is protected
by keeping the government out of the religion business.  Be sure to visit the
ACLU in Congress section this January: Our online voter's guide will provide
instant civil liberties ratings on key Congressional votes,  as well as
legislative alerts and a daily report from Washington when Congress is in
session.</P>
<P>In the meantime, take the religious liberty quiz at right to determine your
LQ (Liberty Quotient).  You might want to do some quick cramming first -- read
the ACLU's collection on religious liberty, including major Supreme Court
opinions and a joint statement on current law. </P>

<B> Celebrating the Literature Others Have Tried to Suppress</B></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Banned Books Week is a time to celebrate literature and art and examine the strains of intolerance and repression that continue to haunt our society.
</P>

<P>
While many people see book censorship as a thing of the past, or an infrequent occurrence, it is neither. Books with clear artistic and cultural merit are still challenged frequently by those who want to control what others read. Permitting restraints on any expression sets the stage for attacks on all expression that is artistically or politically controversial or that portrays some of society's unpleasant features.  Whatever the reason, censorship must be fought whenever it arises.
    
</P> 
<P>
Censorship today comes in many forms. Whenever a school board, librarian, politician or store owner limits your right to decide what you want to see, hear or read, that is censorship.
</P>

<P>
The ACLU opposes all forms of censorship. We believe that people should decide for themselves. For 200 years the right to choose what to see and hear has been one of our most cherished freedoms.
</P>

<P>
Fight book banning and censorship when it happens in your community,  and exercise your right to read the books that others would ban out of fear.

<H3><CENTER>Banned Books Week</CENTER></H3>

Books are banned from public schools and libraries across the country. Censors normally give reasons they want books banned,
but it can be tough to understand the connection between the challenge
and the book.
<P>
In our quiz below we give you six quotes from censors, and 18 books that have been challenged or banned.
Can you guess which quote goes with which book?<P>

<blockquote>
<h1>AOL Transcript 8/22/95 James Fox</h1>
<h5>Copyright 1995 America Online, Inc.</h5>
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	Evening everyone. Thanks for joining us in the latest of the ACLU
CenterStage series. Tonight we're going to be talking with Dr. James Fox, an expert
criminologist, about our nation's crime policy. Let me take a few second to introduce
Dean Fox and we'll get started.
<P>
<STRONG>OnlineHost:</STRONG>	A professor at Northeastern University's
	College of Criminal Justice, James Alan Fox is a
	widely published author and leading expert
	in the areas of juvenile violence, capital
	punishment and workplace violence and
	mass and serial murders.
<P>
<STRONG>OnlineHost:</STRONG>	Professor Fox has testified before
	Congress three times on the effectiveness
	of the death penalty as a crime deterrent.
<P>
<STRONG>OnlineHost:</STRONG>	In addition, the national media has
	turned to Professor Fox repeatedly in
	recent weeks as reporters try to make
	sense of a wave of new statistics about
	crime in this country.
<P>
<STRONG>OnlineHost:</STRONG>	Please join with us in welcoming
	Professor Fox to the AOL Centerstage for
	a discussion about our nation's crime
	policy.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	And a couple of words on the format here
<P>
<STRONG>OnlineHost:</STRONG>	The auditorium consists of two major areas: the
	audience, where you are right now, and the stage,
	where the speakers appear. Text which you type 
	onscreen shows only to those in your row, prefaced
	by the row number in parentheses, such as (2) if 
	you are in row 2. To interact with the speaker,
	use the Interact icon on your screen.
<P>
<STRONG>OnlineHost:</STRONG>	To send your question to the speaker, click on 
	the Interact icon, then use the Ask a Question
	option.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	Okay, Dean Fox, the first question gets to the idea of a dropping
crime rate.
<P>
<STRONG>Question:</STRONG>	What do you make of the LOWER crime rates in New York and other
large cities?
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	Many people have been celebrating
the drop in crime.
However, the news is not all good.
Time has dropped precipitously among adults.
But it has risen sharply among the young.
For example, since 1990, the murder rate committed by adults 25 and older
has decreased.
It has decreased 10% while the murder rate committed by teenagers
has increased 26% in just those 4 years.
If you ignore age, then you can be mislead into thinking that we're winning
the war against crime.
Since the question was raised about NYC in particular,
to some extent this is what I call "Newton's Law of Criminology"...
what goes up, generally comes down.
The murder count in NYC peaked at 2245 in 1990 and has been dropping since
then. But note that in 1985, there there were 1384.
So, while I give Bill Bratton all due credit in professionalizing the NYC police
dept and expanding community policing, to some extent
the rate in NYC was due to come down, anyway.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	We're talking about the nation's crime policies with Dean James Fox.
The next question is a follow up....
<P>
<STRONG>Question:</STRONG>	So, with more and more children being born each year, we're getting
into deeper trouble?
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	Absolutely!
	This is the lull before the crime storm.
	We now have bottomed out in terms of the dropping number of teenagers in
	this country.
	Over the next decade the teenage population will begin to rise again.
	This is the baby boomerang effect - that is children of the Baby Boomers 
	themselves reaching their adolescence. We now have 39 million children under 
	the age of 10, more than we've had for decades. They will be teenagers before you can say juvenile crime wave.
	Unless we reinvest in our youth population now while they are still young
	and impressionable, we will likely face a blood bath of teen killings by 2005.
	The future may make 1995 look like the good old days.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	We're talking with Dr. James Fox, an expert criminologist. The next
question is more philosophical in nature.
<P>
<STRONG>Question:</STRONG>	I live in Hartford Ct and gang violence is a constant threat.  I
see little value placed on a human life.  Killing comes easy.  To what causes do you
attribute this lack of respect or value of life?
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	This generation of youth --- the young and the ruthless --
has more dangerous drugs in their bodies, more deadly weapons in their hands,
and above all a much more casual attitude toward violence.
This generation of youth is more willing to resort to violence over
seemingly trivial issues, such as a leather jacket, a pair of sneakers or
no reason at all.
The questioner is quite right that there is less respect for the value of life.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	We're talking about the nation's crime policy with Dean James Fox.
The next question is about the likely impact on our civil liberties.
<P>
<STRONG>Question:</STRONG>	Professor Fox, if this period is, as you suggest a lull before the
crime storm, should we expect to see even more calls for governmental erosions of our
civil liberties, like unreasonable searches and seizures and the like?
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	We've been seeing this already.
In many cities, such as NYC, police are using tactics to stop, frisk,
certain juveniles for reasons that in previous years, they may not have.
But Americans seem much more willing these days to give up more liberties for
the sake of fighting crime.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	We've got many great questions lined up for Dr. James Fox. The next one is about possible solutions...
<P>
<STRONG>Question:</STRONG>	Professor Fox, doesn't it seem rather self-defeating to focus on
lock 'em up and throw away the key solutions without giving people something to say yes
to? In other words, shouldn't a jobs program be part of any crime control policy?
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	The lock 'em approach to crime control is appealing from a political point of view,
but not very effective in preventing crime.
Most juvenile offenders do not think about consequences.
They may live for today, die for today and maybe kill for today
and the threat of the criminal justice system will not deter them in the least.
The questioner is quite right about giving kids alternatives to say yes to.
Whoever called this the permissive generation hasn't been listening.
We're constantly telling our kids no.
Don't do drugs, don't carry guns, don't watch Beavis and Butthead,
don't have unsafe sex, don't do this, don't do that....
What can they do?
For the sake of saving tax dollars, we've cut back tremendously on programming
for youth.
Everything from educational enrichment programs to recreation.
And in a sense we are now paying the bill in human terms.
In terms of solution, we can start by engaging kids during the "crime prime" hours
of the day - after school and before dinner, when they're idle and unsupervised.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	We're talking about crime and justice with Dean James Fox of
Northeastern University. The next question is about poverty and crime.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	Sorry, folks, it seems to have disappeared from my que. The question was about whether poverty or a lack of moral values causes crime.
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	Both are critical factors here, of course.
They are two of a variety of contributors, however.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	The next question for Dr. James Fox of Northeastern University is
about drugs.
<P>
<STRONG>Question:</STRONG>	Can we begin to solve the problem by legalization of drugs?
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	Clearly there is some merit to that and taken all together there are benefits to
decriminalization at least.
That will handle part of the problem but not all of it.
Drugs are a symptom - not a cause.
Drug use AND criminal activity tend to go hand in hand because the same
population of people who are heavily involved with drugs tend to be more violent.
If you somehow removed the drug problem the crime problem would not disappear. We still have concerns of the breakdown of the American family, lack of supervison of children, poor schools,
prevalance of weapons, violent televsion and movies among other problems with which to contend.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	The next question for Dr. James Fox, an expert criminologist, is
about the death penalty.
<P>
<STRONG>Question:</STRONG>	Do you agree that the death penalty saves more innocent life than
it takes?
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	No, I don't agree.
The evidence is fairly clear that the death penalty does not deter potential	murderers -- that it is, to any degree greater than does life in prison.
In addition. there are of course, many negative aspects to a death penalty such as the risk of mistake, the tremendous cost of prosecuting death penalty cases.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	We're talking about the nation's crime policy with Dr. James Fox. In
a previous answer, Dean Fox mentioned media violence. The next question is about that.
<P>
<STRONG>Question:</STRONG>	Do you think media violence plays a role in real life crime? I
don't.  I think those people need help to begin with.  After all, every country in the
world now gets the major stations.
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	In terms of actual copy cat offenses...
there are a few isolated instances of people who directly mimic what they see on
TV.
The questioner is quite right in that these copy cat offenders already have a
strong predisposition toward crime.
But what many social scientists are more concerned with is the general de-
senstitization or numbing effect that a steady diet of violence on the tube and
in film creates.
This may be in part why our willingness to resort to violence is so much greater 
now. "It's just not such a big deal. After all, we see it all the time on the media."
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	We're talking crime and justice with Dr. James Fox of Northeastern
University. The next question is about rehabilitation.
<P>
<STRONG>Question:</STRONG>	Professor Fox do you think the current criminal justice system in
this country is antquated?  Society dictates we sweep our troubles away by locking
it away.  Isn't prevention the key?  Rehabilition in our current system is a joke.
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	Rehabilitation is a joke in part because it's very difficult to
rehab someone in the context of a prison cell.
The environment is not conducive to an attitude change.
In terms of the criminal justice system being antiquated -- some say bankrupt --
I actually believe it works well most of the time.
When it fails, for example, when a parolee commits a murder,
we see big headlines about the failure.
When it works well, when judges give the right sentence, when parolees stay
free of crime,
when a life sentence is indeed a life sentence,
we hardly ever see any media reports about such positive things.
You've heard the expression "no news is good news"....it's really "good news is
no news."
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	We're talking with Professor James Fox, an expert criminologist. I
promised myself I wouldn't do it, but the next question has the letters OJ in it.
<P>
<STRONG>Question:</STRONG>	What do you think of the national outrage over court procedures
that has erupted as a result of OJ coverage?  Do you think juries should be able to
convict with a super-majority rather than a unanimous verdict?
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	Personnally, I think we've done quite well for many years with the requirement
of unanimity.
The national outrage regarding procedures in the OJ case
reflect the bizarre and extremely unusual nature of this court proceeding.
Americans are being shown
Americans are not being shown how the justice system works most of
the time.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	We have time for one or two more questions for Dean James Fox of
Northeastern University. The next question speaks of something called "race based policing."
<P>
<STRONG>Question:</STRONG>	Professor Fox do you believe in Race base policing. An ethnic group
policing there own within the boundaries of the Law.
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	No I don't.
While the desire for Americans to be much more active in crime control and
patrolling their own neighborhoods is generally a good thing,
we must allow the police to do their job.
In terms of assignments of minority police to minority neighborhoods, this kind of
police management is not always possible.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	This has been a really excellent discussion and I hope Dean Fox will
come back to speak with us soon. I'm going to end, though, on a challenge from an audience member for Dean Fox.
<P>
<STRONG>Question:</STRONG>	You seem to be full of statistics and catch phrases this evening.
Where do you get your stats and phrases like "baby boomerang" and why are you determined
to take EVERY it of good news and turn it in to bad?
<P>
<STRONG>FoxJames:</STRONG>	I have piles of statistics, most of them bad.
And I have a long list of catchy phrases designed to get the point across.
In terms of the future and using words like "blood bath" I choose not to mince
words because I really do believe that big trouble lies ahead.
Over the next 10 yrs, we will see a surge in the number of teenagers (an even greater surge in the number of minority teenagers) and the conditions
in which our children are being raised is getting worse, not better.
The teenage murder rate has increased 165% since 1985.
I expect, unfortunately, it will get worse unless we act now.
But Americans tend not to be very farsighted when it comes to dealing with
a problem that's projected to occur years in the future.
The problem is when the next crime wave hits,
it will be too late to combat it except for locking more people up.
<P>
<STRONG>OnlineHost:</STRONG>	On behalf of the ACLU and AOL,
	let me thank Professor Fox for joining
	us for the latest in the ACLU's
	CenterStage series. And stay tuned
	for more news about the ACLU
	CenterStage: we have invitations out
	to several exciting guests, including
	Dr. Jack Kevorkian!
<P>
<STRONG>OnlineHost:</STRONG>	And remember to join the debate
	live in the ACLU's Free Speech Zone.
	Night or day, you're likely to find others
	eager to debate the hot issues of the
	day. Hope to see you in the Zone.
	Keyword ACLU.
<P>
<STRONG>PhilCLU:</STRONG>	Let me also add a personal thanks for a fascinating conversation.
Next week, we'll be hosting Jay Sekulow, the chief lawyer for Pat
Roberston. 
<P>

<h1>AOL Transcript John Morgan</h1>

<h5>Copyright 1995 America Online, Inc.</h5>
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>	Evening everyone. We'll be beginning our discussion about drug
prohibition with Dr. John Morgan in moments. First let me tell you a little about Dr. Morgan
and his background.
<p><b>OnlineHost:</b>	Dr. John Morgan, a nationally renowned expert on
:	drug policy in the United States, is a professor
:	of pharmacology at the Sophie Davis School of
:	Medicine at City College, City University of New
:	York. A passionate advocate for drug
:	decriminalization, Dr. Morgan has written
:	extensively on the topic of alcohol, drugs and
:	public policy.
<p><b>
OnlineHost:</b>	His current projects include studies of marijuana
:	toxicity, the use of marijuana as medicine, the
:	social pharmacology of crack and cocaine, and the
:	impact of drug prohibition on drug potency and
:	purity.
<p><b>
OnlineHost:</b>	Dr. Morgan joins the ACLU to discuss the folly of
:	drug prohibition. Please welcome him to Center Stage.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	And now just a couple words about the format here and then we'll start.
<p><b>
OnlineHost:</b>	The auditorium consists of two major areas: the
:	audience, where you are right now, and the stage,
:	where the speakers appear. Text which you type 
:	onscreen shows only to those in your row, prefaced
:	by the row number in parentheses, such as (2) if 
:	you are in row 2. To interact with the speaker,
:	use the Interact icon on your screen.
<p><b>
OnlineHost:</b>	To send your question to the speaker, click on 
:	the Interact icon, then use the Ask a Question
:	option.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Okay...the first question, and I'll paraphrase this one if I may, is whether Dr. Morgan is in favor of drug legalization.
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I am surely in favor of drug legalization, although the term of legalization provokes such feeling of emotional response that I usually start with decriminalization. I no longer want anyone to go to jail or be arrested for possession
or use of drugs.  I'm fond of saying that once that's in place, that people regain the right of self-ownership.  Then, something else will have to be done about supply and regulation, purity, taxation, but I'll leave those decisions to my children.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Dr. John Morgan about the national policy of drug prohibition. The next question is a follow up....
<p><b>
Question:</b>	What problems, if any, do you foresee arising from decriminalization?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	It's difficult to me to think of problems because we are so beset with the problems of prohibition, but it is possible that there may be increased use of some substance by some people after legalization and I know that this is a great concern of many. However, I suspect such use will be experimental and largely non-harmful just as most use is today.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	The next question for Dr. John Morgan is about a recent pronouncement from the Speaker of the House.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Newt Gingrich recently called for national referendum on drug policy - do you favor such a vote, and who do you think would win?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	Well, I favor a national discussion, a national commission, and I'm perfectly happy for there to be a national referendum.
However, I suspect that prohibition and prohibitionists would win a referendum. That fact does not make prohibition right or moral.
Our only hope is to continue knocking at doors and speaking to try to persuade Americans that prohibition is harmful. However, I would add that even if we never have the majority to win a referendum, our Constitution should still protect drug
users from state intervention.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking about our nation's policy on drugs with Dr. John Morgan. Here's an offbeat question that I'm curious to get Dr. Morgan's response to...
<p><b>
Question:</b>	The criminalization of drugs is designed to ensure we have a subclass of criminals, someone whom to blame, diverting attention from the real problems with this nation using the fear to trample with our constitutional rights. Would you care to
comment on this?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	In essense, I agree, although the marginalization and creation of criminals is not really conspiratorial.  I guess I would refer the questioner to a book called Ceremonial Chemistry by Thomas Szasz. He makes the point very clearly that drug users and drug dealers have become the required scapegoats in this society. A society can exist without honor and decency and a variety of
things, but it cannot exist without scapegoats.  Apparently, there must be someone to blame for our troubles.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	The next question -- and I'm going to paraphrase again -- is whether you believe increased addiction would result from legalization or decriminalization?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I doubt that legalization would lead to increased addiction.  I would point out that addiction, of course, has occurred often during prohibition. The chief failure of prohibition is that it does not stop, or even significanty curtail, drug use.  Although increased availability might lead to increased use, I envision in a more rational world more rational drug use.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Dr. John Morgan, a national expert on drug policy.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Do you expect any now illegal drugs to be legalized in the near future?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I do.  I cannot believe that marijuana will not be legalized or decriminalized in the next ten years.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	What proof do you have that legalization will help America?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	Let me approach the question from a slightly different direction. At the end of alcohol prohibition in 1934, there was no increased use of alcohol for the next decade.  So, the lifting of prohibition did not generate harmful consumption.  But the lifting of prohibition deflated the criminal enterprise, curtailed the sale of poisonous alcohol, and improved American life.  I believe that prohibition generates such harms, poisoning, and criminal activity without diminishing drug use. I believe those marks constitute proof, although I don't have much empirical data.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Dr. John Morgan, a noted pharmacologist and expert on the nation's drug policy. The next question is about that funny tobacco-like substance.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Has anyone ever died directly from smoking marijuana?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I believe the answer is no.  Marijuana's toxicity is so low that people essentially cannot kill themselves acutely.  Recent research has demonstrated that there are very few cannabinoid receptors in the brain portion which regulate respiration and heart function.  This explains the wide safety margin of marijuana.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	In the interest of time, I'll paraphrase the next question...What do you think about medical use of marijuana?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I am a strong supporter of medical use. The best way and the cheapest way to deliver THC to the blood
stream is by smoking it. Therefore, I believe that THC's usefullness in stopping nausea and vomiting increasing appetite, treating glaucoma can be delivered by smoking. Therefore, I believe individuals and their physicians should make
the decision about theraputic use of marijuana.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Dr. John Morgan about the nation's drug policy. The next question is about the harder stuff.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Don't you think that the legalization of extremely addictive drugs such as cocaine and herion would hurt, more than help, society?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I do not.  I do not believe that drugs should be legalized because they are safe, but should be legalized because they are dangerous. During the last 50 years, we have continued to have problems with heroin, cocaine, and other drugs, even though they are prohibited. In fact, heroin is a relatively safe drug made terribly dangerous by prohibition. This does not mean I approve of heroin use, or cocaine use, and I'm not encouraging anyone, young or old, to use such drugs. However, I believe that prohibition has made it much worse than even the frightening idea of such drugs being legally available. The legislation of morality does not work.
We cannot modify dangerous and risky behavior by and large by making it illegal.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Dr. John Morgan about the nation's policy of drug prohibition. The next question is about the politics of the issue.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Current political attitudes will not tolerate a serious proposal to decriminalize/legalize drugs.  What steps do you believe need to be taken to enact a sweeping change in the mentality of the people in this country?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I plan to shout loudly. :) Seriously, this is a political battle that I do not approach foolishly, although I do approach it optimistically. In 1929, President Hoover received a report from a commission which stated that prohibition really was working, but we just needed a little more money and a little more committment. Four years later, prohibition was dead. Prohibition is a foolish 20th Century concept - maybe it will die in the 21st.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We've got many, many excellent questions for Dr. Morgan. You're all making my job very difficult here. The next question is about what if the unimaginable would indeed happen.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	What role should government have in the distribution and regulation of legalized drugs? Should taxes be collected on them?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I wish not. However, that wish is almost certainly naive.  John D. Rockefeller became opposed to alcohol prohibition, but also proposed that no one should profit from the sale of alcohol. I worry about a government and agents of the government becoming
reliant on drug profits.  However, I prefer a taxed legality to and will vote for it, despite my fears.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking drug policy with Dr. John Morgan. Here's one about the international scene.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Do you think the US will be incorporating harm reduction measures
such as Great Britain has done?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I certainly do.  The idea and philosophy of harm reduction is appealing to many decent people, even those who fear drug use. So I believe that encouraging Americans in the ideas of harm reduction is valuable. Harm reduction implies that we can reduce the harm done by drugs even if we cannot convince individuals to stop using drugs dangerously. One of the best examples of harm reduction is the provision of nicotine in skin patches.  Users who cannot or will not give up nicotine can consume it much more safely. Also, although we've made some steps in that direction, we don't really hate nicotine users yet.  So, harm reduction applied to a legal gives me some hope that we can do better than we have heretofore. That is, with such approaches to illegal drugs.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	The next question, I believe, is from someone who opposes your ideas
about drug decriminalization, Dr. Morgan.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Who pays for the indulgences of legalized drug use?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	Who pays for the indulgences of legalized chainsaw use? I believe that legalization must be accompanied with clear
expression of user responsibility.  For example, I would make the penalty of driving while intoxicated with a previously illegal drug very
harsh. I believe that the America exists because of the ideas of responsibility and freedom, and I cannot see why those do not apply to drug use.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking about drug prohibition with Dr. John Morgan. And our
next question is...
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Do you believe that the frequency of crimes committed while under
the influence of drugs will increase if they are decriminalized?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I do not. Some acts of alcohol consumption precede criminal behavior, however, most acts of consumption, and even intoxication, do not cause criminal behavior. The chief connection between crime and drugs is of course the idea or fact that possession of drugs is a crime.  I do not fear increased criminality after legalization.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Several people in the audience have asked, Dr. Morgan, whether you
believe ALL drugs should be legalized.
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I do.  I think marijuana's legalization makes sense because it is relatively safe, and I would start with legalization of marijuana as a political reality.  Legalization of more harmful drugs, i.e. cocaine, heroin is proper because prohibition does not work, and in fact makes the drug more dangerous.  There was very wide consumption of cocaine beverage and smokable opium at the turn of the century. Criminalizing that behavior led to the marketing of more dangerous forms of those drugs.  The iron rule of prohibition is the
generation of more potent and more dangerous forms of the drug. So, I am not afraid of legalizing dangerous drugs, in fact, I'm
afraid not to.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	The next question for Dr. Morgan deals with the recent NIDA
conference, which I believe he attended.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Would you also comment on the recent statement at the NIDA
conference in which Lee P. said marijuana caused violence.
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I do not believe that marijuana causes violence. Furthermore, there was nothing presented at the NIDA conference which proved that marijuana causes violence. The idea that drugs cause violence is actually never provable. We believe, however, that drugs are used by dangerous and violent people, which is one of the reasons we criminalize the drugs and marginalize the users. The fact that marijuana is detectable for days after use means that it can be blamed by Lee Brown and other fools for anything that happened during those days.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We have time for two more questions. The next one is one that I'm
particularly interested in since my best friend just died of a drug overdose.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	With decriminalization, would it be easier to obtain help for
people with drug abuse problems?  (Treatment for the abuser, support services for the
family, etc.)  It has been nearly impossible to gain access to realistic drug treatment.
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b> 	Absolutely, we could help drug users better if drugs were legal. We deny services to drug users, and in fact even deny housing, jobs, and freedom from prison, to drug users.  I believe that criminalizing drug use essentially guarantees that people shall not be treated decently.  I believe that some drug users harmed by prohibition shall need a variety of help and services and treatment when prohibition ends.  However, many drug users will not need such help and will not desire it because they will use drugs safely.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We have time for just one last question, I'm afraid, but rest
assured this is a topic that the ACLU will soon explore once again. And I'll paraphrase the
last question, which was asked by many members of the audience:</b> Do you, Dr. Morgan, use
drugs?
<p><b>
JohnMrgn:</b>	I will choose not to answer.  But I ask those who were curious whether they think my answers would be more or less informed if they knew whether I was a drug user or not.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Alright. Please join me in thanking Dr. Morgan. And if you have
strong feelings about this topic, as we all apparently do, please visit the ACLU's
Constitution Hall and voice your opinions there. (Keyword ACLU). Thanks all.

<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Welcome all. Thanks for coming to the ACLU's 3d Center Stage Event.
Our first question is about Wendy's new book.
<p><b>
Question:</b> What is your new book, "It's All the Rage: Crime and Culture"
about?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> My new book examines our notions of individual accountability and
victimhood. It examines notions of accountability in the popular culture,
focusing on the way they are played out in the criminal justice system. It is part an argument
against the death penalty, a critique of the irrationalism of criminal justice debates,
and it examines a range of particular criminal justice issues -- it looks at the federal crime bill,
violence in the media, gun control, but its central focus is the double standard that you see when
you look at standards of accountability that people apply to themselves in the recovery
movement and the standards that apply to the vast majority of criminal defendants.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b> We're talking with author, Wendy Kaminer.
<p><b>
Question:</b> What is the largest challenge facing the feminist community today?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> It's difficult for me to single out the largest challenge.  Welfare
"reform" of course, is primary today; so are abortion rights.  And, as usual there are
deep divisions within the feminist movement that always need to be addressed.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Is there an ultimate solution to drastically reduce crime in
America, or is it hopeless?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> There are no ultimate solutions to anything, in my view.  The
desire for ultimate solutions is the problem.  We will only reduce crime and violence
incrementally, with incremental solutions.  Looking for sweeping ultimate solutions, we end up
only with symbolic solutions like the death penalty, which we are incapable of administering
fairly. like three strikes you're out laws, which may actually decrease the felony
conviction rate, because they increase court congestion.  Looking for ultimate
solutions, we leave ourselves open to demagoguery.  There are some small scale solutions we
can think about: We should, for example, do a better job of enforcing laws
against gun ownership and use by juveniles.  Police in general have done very little to try
to control the black market in guns for kids.  We should reform mandatory minimum drug laws,
which fill our prisons with non-violent, low level drug offenders; we should encourage and
even fund, (imagine that) community groups acting to prevent violence in their neighborhoods.
We shouldn't  scoff at midnight basketball; it works.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking about crime and feminism and many other topics with
author Wendy Kaminer.
<p><b>
Question:</b> What did you think of Clinton and Reno's immediate response after
the Oklahoma City bombing stating that the death penalty would be sought?  Political posturing?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> Yes.  I think support for the death penalty generally entails a lot
of political posturing. It's particularly irritating coming from Janet Reno because she
presents herself as an opponent of the death penalty. Clinton sold out on the death penalty long
ago; he is after all the man who killed to get elected.  I think he's smart enough to know that the
death penalty doesn't work and like Janet Reno, he likes to display a lot of ersatz moral
agonizing about enforcing it, but enforce it he will, to remain in office.
<p><b>
Question:</b> I'd be curious to know what, if any, good you see in the recovery
movement.
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> Millions of people have reads recovery books, some of which contain
simple common sense advice about family life  Some people learn from these books.  The
recovery movement has probably done some good raising consciousness about child
abuse, though I often think that whatever good it's done has been wiped out by the harm its
done by defining child abuse so broadly that it's nearly meaningless.  Recovery experts define
abuse as any form of inadequate nurturance, which means that being yelled at or simply
ignored is the equivalent of being raped or battered.  In the end, I think recovery
trivialize the most serious instances of abuse.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking with author Wendy Kaminer. The next question is about
the death penalty.
<p><b>
Question:</b> If the Republicans (and Republicrats, like B. Clinton) succeed in
gutting death penalty appeals, and we start executing a large number of people, like,
say, the 4,000 on death row within the next 2 years, do you think the increased carnage will
undermine support for the death penalty?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> No, I'm afraid. not, Executions are hardly even publicized
anymore.  This week, for example, the Times reported two executions in a few paragraphs
buried in the middle of the national section (often reports of executions are buried in the
metropolitan section).  So, for the most part, executions happen in obscurity. If people did hear
about executions, if they were publicized, even televised, I fear more would enjoy them than be
repelled by them
<p><b>
Question:</b> If we need to create incremental solutions, then what can we, the
everyman, do?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> I'm better at criticism than social engineering, so I always have a
hard time answering good practical questions like "what can the average person do?"  Of
course, there are obvious answers, like the average person can get involved
in local politics, the average person can get involved in violence prevention
programs in his or her own neighborhood, the average person can engage with local radio and
TV talk shows on crime.  I'm afraid, though, that's not a very good answer.  I'm
best at knowing what I can do personally, which is write and think about issues like these, point
out problems, and hope that people like you can do a better job than I can of
figuring out where to go next. I've always seen the formulation of public policy - and solutions
to social problems --  as a collaborative effort.  I've always felt that my part of the
job was to analyze and criticize in the hope that other people might use my work to forge
solutions.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking with author Wendy Kaminer. The next question is about
a recent Supreme Court decision.
<p><b>
Question:</b> What is your view of the Court's ruling on Affirmative Action?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> I think Linda Greenhouse got it right in her analysis in the Times.
Basically, the Supreme Court's decision didn't  matter all that much, because the
President and Congress were going back on affirmative action anyway.  I do have a concern
though about the way in which the Court's decision, requiring the application of a strict
standard of review to affirmative action programs, may end up by watering down strict scrutiny -
because the Court's opinion made it clear, more or less, that strict scrutiny needn't be fatal.
I hope this decision doesn't end up making the Court more deferential to discriminatory
legislation.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking with ACLU guest Wendy Kaminer. The next question is
about crime.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Midnight basketball games ? Whatever happened to keep the kids at
home after a certain hour instead of leaving them roam free?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> Some kids don't have parents to keep them home; some kids will be
roaming free if the community doesn't provide programs for them.  It's an
unfortunate reality we have to deal with.
<p><b>
Question:</b> How do we bring the reform issues you discuss into the arena of
"mainstream" political debate in this country?  The spectrum of discourse is so far right
today!
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> Politicians need to believe that there are voters on the left who
will hold them accountable.  So, the solution is a bit long term, more effective organizing,
voter registration on the left.  And better education of people in the middle.
Liberals could surely do a better job of getting their message out on the airwaves.  Why,
after all, are radio talk show so conservative?
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Here's a question about the ACLU.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Why does it always appear the ACLU always takes a view just to be
controversial? Doesn't that make you part of a problem?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> Not everything that appears true is true.  The ACLU is devoted to
some very controversial principles -- like the principle that everyone who is arrested should
enjoy the same constitutional rights, regardless of their alleged crime or their
character.  We don't take that position to irritate people; we take that position because we
believe in it. We believe in it, in part, in a spirit of enlightened
self-interest, because the rights of each one of us are co-extensive with the rights of everyone
who is arrested and prosecuted in the criminal courts.  If we all don't enjoy the same
rights, then no one enjoys any rights at all; some of us merely enjoy privilege.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking with ACLU guest Wendy Kaminer, author of a new book on
crime and culture.
Question: Do you see more Americans ready to give up some civil liberties to
gain a  more stable society?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> Yes, But I'm not sure the number of Americans ready to cede their
civil liberties has increased.  The choice between liberty and order is classic.  Think
back to the red scares of the 1920s or to the years of McCarthyism.  Fear of crime
has been rising since the late l960s.  In recent history you can trace intense fear of
crime, and the exploitation of that fear by politicians to Richard Nixon's 1968
presidential campaign; he ran on a law and order platform.  In the past 5 years, increased fear
of crime also reflects changes in the nature of violent crime.  Violent crime by young
juveniles is up, and violent juvenile crime is particularly chilling; we're not
supposed to be afraid of our children.  Gun violence is up as well and that makes people
feel much more vulnerable. It will be interesting tho to see if increasing mistrust of
government will undermine increasing demands for harsh government crackdowns on crime.  I
fear not.  There is a lot of cognitive dissonance in people's thinking about crime
control.
<p><b>
Question:</b> In "I'm Dysfunctional.." you seem angry with academic
postmodernists.  If you value criticism as much as you claim, what is your problem with fellow
social critics?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> Which social critics?  Which academic postmodernists?  In general,
academic post-modernist don't practice much social criticism.  Their subject is often
academic theory about culture not culture itself.  And their ideas are cloaked in impenetrable
jargon that only other academics with graduates degrees can understand.  I don't like
people who use language to obscure , who use language to intimidate.  A lot of intelligent
lay readers when confronted with a piece of academic writing, assume they can't understand it
because they're not smart or educated enough.  They may not understand it because
it's badly written and doesn't have all that much meaning to begin with.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking with Wendy Kaminer, noted feminist and author.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Do you think men can be feminists?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> Sure.
<p><b>
Question:</b> What's your opinion on the proposed chemical castration of rapists?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> I suppose if there were a way to ensure that chemical castration as
an alternative to incarceration could be truly voluntary, I could support it -- though we
don't usually allow convicted felons to choose their punishment.  But it's hard for me
to imagine that when confronted with prison, the choice to have yourself castrated
ever could be voluntary. It seems like cruel and unusual punishment to me when it's
coerced.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking with Wendy Kaminer and we have time for two more
questions.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Could Prof. Kaminer comment on C. MacKinnon's influence. 
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> I think Catherine MacKinnon is the anti-Christ.  That's the short
answer. What I dislike about her most is that she lies to people, particularly young people about
what the First Amendment means; she uses her legal knowledge and her facility with language as
a club --  you can't really argue with MacKinnon unless you have a fairly sophisticated
understanding of the First Amendment, because she misrepresents it so badly.  I've also always
wondered at her political naivety. She believes deeply that our legal institutions are male
dominated, oppressive to women, yet she's willing to give them more power than they already
have to censor.  What makes MacKinnon think that when the time comes to implement her
censorship laws, she'll be the one with the power to do it?
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We've got time for one more question.
<p><b>
Question:</b> It seems to me that the Entertainment Industry has more effect on
the average person than education. Without impairing free speech, what do you see are
changes that could be made in that industry that could help create a saner more sensitive culture?
<p><b>
Wkaminer:</b> Whatever changes are made will have to come from within the
industry itself -- in response from pressure from consumers.  I don't blame the industry so much
as I blame the audience. At least, there is a clear collaboration between producers and
consumers.  I'd like to see consumers take responsibility for their own preferences.
<p><b>
OnlineHost:</b>    Our thanks to Wendy Kaminer for joining us today.
:    For a transcript of this event, please be sure to
:    check back in about 24 hours. And be sure to stop
:    back at 4pm ET when noted gay activist Tom
:    Stoddard appears online. Thank you and good
:    afternoon!

			Victory!

			<HR>
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
				We hope you are all still basking in the glow of success from our stunning victory in 
				<U>
					ACLU v. Reno 
				</U>
				! And we hope you have had the chance to read the opinion. It is a moving affirmation of the importance of free speech rights in any medium. 
				<P>
				We want to express our warmest thanks for all your help in the case. One of the most rewarding aspects of working on the case has been getting to know all of you -- your work is truly inspirational. Without such compelling plaintiffs, we could never have built such a strong case against online censorship. Your voices drove home the draconian effect the CDA would have had on the democratizing medium of cyberspace. Again and again, the judges' opinions evoke concern with the particular problems you would have faced had the CDA been upheld. Throughout each opinion, each judge emphasized the particular impact on non-profit organizations and non commercial speakers. They understood that under the CDA you would have been forced "to choose between silence and the risk of prosecution." 
				<P>
				The following memorandum explains the current status of our case, and provides a summary of the most significant aspects of the decision. As always, please feel free to call or e-mail with any questions. (The full decision, and many other case-related documents, are available from our web site at http://www.aclu.org.) 
				<P>
				<B>
					Status and Future Proceedings: 
				</B>
				<P>
				The Order of the Court preliminarily enjoins the Government from "enforcing, prosecuting, investigating or reviewing any matter premised upon" the "indecency" or "patently offensive" provisions of the CDA. As plaintiffs in this action, you are therefore currently protected from prosecution under the CDA anywhere. In addition, we believe the injunction protects 
				<B>
					all
				</B>
				online users (not just the plaintiffs in the consolidated cases). 
				<P>
				The government has twenty days from the date of the decision to file a notice of appeal in the case, which makes the deadline July 2nd. They have not yet announced whether they will appeal. 
				<P>
				As you know, there is another case, 
				<U>
					Shea v. Reno 
				</U>
				, pending before a three-judge court in the Southern District of New York. Proceedings in that case have concluded and that court could issue an opinion at any time. (Of course, we hope the New York judges will find the CDA as blatantly unconstitutional as did the Philadelphia judges.) There is a slim possibility that the government could decline to appeal our case, and choose instead to appeal the 
				<U>
					Shea 
				</U>
				case. However, the New York case already includes portions of our evidentiary record, and there is a possibility that the New York court will rule that the government is bound by the findings of fact issued by the Philadelphia court in our case. This means that regardless of which case is actually appealed, the record that goes to the Supreme Court will contain at least some of our factual record. (Of course, we would prefer that the Supreme Court have our 
				<B>
					entire
				</B>
				factual record, especially because, unlike the 
				<U>
					Shea 
				</U>
				record, our record includes much detailed information about the impact of the CDA on non-profit speakers.) We emphasize that it is unlikely, for political reasons, that the government will choose to appeal only the 
				<U>
					Shea 
				</U>
				case. It is more likely that the government will appeal both cases (in which case they would be consolidated at the Supreme Court), or will appeal neither case. 
				<P>
				If the government declines to appeal our case, we will ask the Philadelphia court to convert our preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction. While normally that would require a full-scale trial (as opposed to the hearing on the preliminary injunction that was already held), we hope to persuade the court that there is no need for any further proceedings. The government would likely oppose our motion and argue that it has the right to put on further evidence. If the court decides to go forward with a trial, we will again need your help in presenting testimony and evidence. (The evidence would probably focus on whether screening and age verification technology had progressed since the preliminary injunction hearing, and the impact of the CDA on online speakers in light of any new technology.) If the court decides to issue a permanent injunction (with or without a trial), the government will have another chance to appeal. If the government does not appeal, or if they appeal and the Supreme Court affirms the decision, the CDA will be permanently "dead." 
				<P>
				Of course, Congress could always come back with a "Son of CDA." We will continue to lobby vigorously against any new content-based Internet regulation, and we encourage all of you to remain active in opposing such legislation. 
				<P>
				<B>
					The Findings of Fact: 
				</B>
				<P>
				The importance of the court's findings of fact cannot be overemphasized. Although the judges wrote three separate opinions, the facts were adopted jointly by all three judges. The extensive findings of fact mean that the Supreme Court would have an incredible wealth of factual information to consider if it hears the case on appeal from the preliminary injunction. (The Supreme Court must normally defer to a lower court's findings of fact, and review only issues of law.) In addition, as the first thorough review by a federal court of the online medium, the findings of facts will likely become a necessary reference for all future cases involving cyberspace. 
				<P>
				Although not included in the text of the opinion, the court adopted as fact literally hundreds of paragraphs describing each of the plaintiffs and the nature and content of their speech potentially affected by the CDA (so the hard work you all put into your affidavits and declarations paid off!). All of these facts will become part of the record on appeal. Some of the most crucial findings included in the text of the opinion were:

				<B>
					Similarities and Differences in the Three Opinions: 
				</B>
				<P>
				We are still in the process of analyzing all the nuances of the decision. As you know, the judges issued three separate opinions. (We're not sure why the judges wrote separate opinions, but we suspect it is because they enjoyed the case so much that they were unwilling to let only one judge have all the fun!) Normally, when a panel of judges decides a case, they issue one "opinion of the court" (individual judges may then write separate opinions agreeing or disagreeing with certain holdings of the court). The 
				<U>
					ACLU v. Reno 
				</U>
				decision is unusual in that, apart from the joint findings of fact, the judges wrote entirely separate opinions. Thus, there is no "opinion of the court," and to determine the "opinion of the court" one must parse all three opinions (which we've tried to do for you below). The fact that the judges wrote separate opinions will not be significant on appeal, because the Supreme Court will apply its own rationale to decide the legal issues in the case. 
				<P>
				While there is much similarity in the opinions, there are important differences. All three judges unequivocally held that both the "indecency" and "patent offensiveness" provisions of the CDA are unconstitutional on their face. All three judges agreed that the CDA failed the "strict scrutiny" test, that is, the CDA was not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest. All three judges also agreed that both provisions are unconstitutionally overbroad. 
				<P>
				Judge Sloviter raised the issue of whether the "indecency" and "patent offensiveness" provisions were synonymous, implying that she believed they were not, but declining to rule on the issue at this stage. Judge Buckwalter held explicitly that they were not synonymous, and while "indecency" provided even less guidance, both provisions were equally unconstitutional. Judge Dalzell held that the terms were synonymous, but agreed that both provisions were unconstitutional. 
				<P>
				Judge Sloviter and Judge Buckwalter also held that the CDA is unconstitutionally vague. Judge Dalzell, however, thought that the CDA was not unconstitutionally vague. 
				<P>
				Judge Dalzell held the view that 
				<B>
					any
				</B>
				content-based regulation of the Internet would violate the First Amendment because of the unique nature of the medium. Judge Buckwalter, however, believes "it is too early in the development of this new medium to conclude that other attempts to regulate" the Internet would fail a constitutional challenge, noting that a "harmful to minors" standard for the print medium had survived constitutional challenge. Judge Sloviter did not consider the issue. 
				<BR>
				<BR>
				<B>
					Summary of Issues and Highlights from the Opinion: 
				</B>
				<P>
				<B>
					Plaintiffs Have Standing to Challenge the CDA. 
				</B>
				<P>
				The government had hinted in its briefs that it believed that plaintiffs' fears of prosecution were so weak as to raise questions about whether they had standing to challenge the CDA. Judge Dalzell was the only judge to address this issue explicitly. He found plaintiffs' fears legitimate, and wrote that there was no question that plaintiffs had standing. He noted, for example, that the FCC had found that a broadcast dealing with AIDS was indecent because it was presented "in a manner that is patently offensive." Judge Dalzell noted that in our case, many plaintiffs " 
				<U>
					want 
				</U>
				to pander and titillate on their Web sites, at least to a degree, to attract a teen audience and deliver their message in an engaging and coherent way." Judge Dalzell also said that, given the history the Carlin "seven dirty words" case, plaintiffs legitimately feared that using vulgar words might subject them to prosecution under the CDA. 
				<P>
				<B>
					The Government's Asserted "Compelling Interest" in the CDA is Questionable. 
				</B>
				<P>
				To pass constitutional muster, laws that burden speech must use the least restrictive means to accomplish a compelling government interest. The government argued that shielding minors from access to pornography was its "compelling interest" in the CDA. Judge Sloviter explicitly questioned this rationale, although she declined to base her decision on the government's failure to prove a compelling interest. She distinguished cases finding a "compelling interest" in laws regulating dial-a-porn and child pornography, noting that in those cases "the potential harm to children from the material was evident." She found that much of the material covered by the CDA contained value for older minors, and noted that the government had failed to prove a "compelling interest" in preventing minors from accessing that valuable information. This aspect of the opinion, while not an explicit holding, contrasts with other cases that had glossed over the requirement that the government prove a "compelling interest" in content-based regulations. 
				<P>
				<B>
					The CDA is Not Narrowly Tailored. 
				</B>
				<P>
				Judge Sloviter was also the only judge to address the "narrow tailoring" requirement explicitly. She wrote, "[I]t is difficult to characterize a criminal statute that hovers over each content provider, like the proverbial sword of Damocles, as a narrow tailoring. . . . No provider, whether an individual, non-profit corporation, or even large publicly held corporation, is likely to willingly subject itself to prosecution for a miscalculation of the prevalent community standards or for an error in judgment as to what is indecent." 
				<P>
				<B>
					The CDA Cannot Be Rewritten to Make It Constitutional. 
				</B>
				<P>
				To get around the narrow tailoring requirement, the government had asked the Court to construe the statute narrowly so that it applied only to commercial pornographers. The judges were unpersuaded by this argument because the plain language of the statute, and its legislative history, showed that Congress knew the statute would cover non-commercial as well as commercial content providers. In addition, the CDA clearly covered more than pornography because "indecency" encompasses works of serious value and material that lacks prurient appeal. 
				<P>
				<B>
					The CDA Would Not Keep Online Pornography From Children. 
				</B>
				<P>
				Judge Dalzell emphasized that the CDA would not even be effective at keeping online pornography away from minors. He noted that a large amount of such material originates overseas, and that even in the United States commercial pornographers would remain relatively unaffected by the Act because most of them already require credit cards for access. 
				<BR>
				<B>
					<BR>
					There Are Other Options Available To Advance the Government's Goal. 
				</B>
				<P>
				The judges reminded the government that it could continue to protect children from pornography through vigorous enforcement of existing obscenity and child pornography laws. In addition, Judge Sloviter wrote that "Congress . . . could have chosen to assist and support the development of technology that would enable parents, schools, and libraries to screen such material from their end." Dalzell added that "there is also a compelling need for public education about the benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the Government can fill that role as well." 
				<P>
				The Court reiterated that the primary responsibility for determining children's level of access to the Internet remains where it should be -- with parents. Judge Dalzell wrote, "[P]arents can install blocking software on their home computers, or they can subscribe to commercial online services that provide parental controls. It is quite clear that powerful market forces are at work to expand parental options to deal with these legitimate concerns." 
				<P>
				<B>
					The CDA is Unconstitutionally Overbroad. 
				</B>
				<P>
				Because the judges found as a factual matter that there was no effective way to screen for age on the Internet, the Court held that both provisions of the CDA are overbroad, that is, the provisions prevent adults as well as minors from obtaining access to "indecent" material. Judge Sloviter wrote, "A wealth of persuasive evidence . . . proved that it is either technologically impossible or economically prohibitive for many of the plaintiffs to comply with the CDA without seriously impeding their posting of online material which adults have a constitutional right to access." 
				<P>
				<B>
					The "Indecency" and "Patently Offensive" Standards are Vague. 
				</B>
				<P>
				Judge Sloviter and Judge Buckwalter held that the CDA is unconstitutionally vague, that is, that the provisions lack the clarity required to inform persons as to what speech is criminal, and give too much discretion to prosecutors to decide what the law means. This is a violation of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause and is also a violation of the First Amendment because of the tendency of vague laws to chill protected speech. Judge Sloviter was wholly unpersuaded by the government's response to our vagueness claim: "The government . . . suggests that the concerns expressed by the plaintiffs and the questions posed by the court reflect an exaggerated supposition of how it would apply the law, and that we should, in effect, trust the Department of Justice to limit the CDA's application in a reasonable fashion . . . . That would require a broad trust indeed from a generation of judges not far removed from the attacks on James Joyce's 
				<U>
					Ulysses 
				</U>
				as obscene." As Judge Buckwalter explained, "Such unfettered discretion to prosecutors . . . is precisely what due process does not allow." 
				<P>
				Judge Buckwalter's opinion contains a very thorough review of the law of vagueness. He summarized, "If the Government is going to intrude upon the sacred ground of the First Amendment and tell its citizens that their exercise of protected speech could land them in jail, the law imposing such a penalty must clearly define the prohibited speech not only for the potential offender but also for the potential enforcer." He noted that criminal laws applied to new media like the Internet need particularly clear standards "because even commonly understood terms may have different connotations or parameters in this new context." 
				<P>
				Judge Dalzell declined to join the other two judges in holding that the CDA was unconstitutionally vague. He followed the holdings of some appellate courts that had previously concluded that the "indecency" standard was not vague when applied to media like the telephone and cable television. The cases that Judge Dalzell cited made our vagueness argument a difficult one, and it is a victory for free speech that two of the three judges were persuaded by our arguments despite those cases. 
				<P>
				<B>
					The Defenses Do Not Save the CDA. 
				</B>
				<P>
				The judges were unconvinced by the government's argument that the CDA's defenses provided an effective way for online users to avoid prosecution. Judge Buckwalter found the defenses, like the criminal prohibition, to be unconstitutionally vague: "[I]ndividuals attempting to comply with the statute presently have no clear indication of what actions will ensure that they will be insulated from criminal sanctions under the CDA." 
				<P>
				Judge Sloviter was unpersuaded by the government's proposed tagging defense. She wrote, "I do not believe a statute is narrowly tailored when it subjects to potential criminal penalties those who must depend upon third parties for the effective operation of a statutory defense." Even if tagging technology became available, said Judge Sloviter, requiring speakers to tag their speech would be "a burden one should not have to bear in order to transmit information protected under the Constitution." 
				<P>
				<BR>
				<B>
					The Government Cannot Depend on "Future" Technology to Save the CDA. 
				</B>
				<P>
				The Court was particularly disturbed by the government's "extraordinary argument" that technology would eventually produce ways to comply with the CDA. Judge Sloviter wrote, "I can imagine few arguments less likely to persuade a court to uphold a criminal statute than one that depends on future technology to cabin the reach of the statute within constitutional bounds." 
				<P>
				<B>
					The CDA Fails to Define the Relevant Community Standard. 
				</B>
				<P>
				The judges recognized that one of the fatal flaws of the CDA was its potential to allow the most conservative community in the United States to set the standard for "indecency" all over the nation. Judge Dalzell wrote, "Because the creation and posting of a Web site allows users anywhere in the country to see that site, many speakers will no doubt censor their speech so that it is palatable in every community." While Congress' Conference Report indicated a desire to set a national standard for "indecency," the government argued that local community standards would apply. Judge Buckwalter recognized that this conflict would leave "the reader of the CDA unable to discern the relevant 'community standard,' and will undoubtedly cause Internet users to 'steer far wider of the unlawful zone' than if the community standard to be applied were clearly defined. The chilling effect on the Internet users' exercise of free speech is obvious." 
				<P>
				<B>
					The CDA Covers Speech That Has Value to Minors. 
				</B>
				<P>
				The Court recognized that the CDA would have prevented minors from gaining access to valuable materials. Judge Sloviter was the true champion of the free speech rights of minors. She found that "at least some of the material subject to coverage under the . . . CDA may contain valuable literary, artistic or educational information of value to older minors." She wrote that the government had no interest "in preventing a seventeen-year-old minor from accessing" images like the play "Angels in America," articles on female genital mutilation, National Geographic pictures, or famous sexually explicit paintings. In addition, she believed that plaintiffs like Critical Path AIDS Project and Stop Prisoner Rape presented convincing testimony that their material was "critically important for certain older minors." 
				<P>
				Judge Dalzell noted that laws based on a desire to protect children are as dangerous as they are compelling. Recognizing the importance of instilling democratic values in children, he wrote that "regulations that 'drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace' for children's benefit, risk destroying the very 'political system and cultural life,' that they will inherit when they come of age." 
				<P>
				While the judges ultimately did not rest their decision on the CDA's unconstitutional application to minors, their strong statements affirming the rights of minors to receive information are a victory for our plaintiffs who see minors as a crucial part of their audience and for the teenage witnesses who submitted such compelling affidavits for the case. 
				<P>
				<B>
					The Online Medium Is Different Than Other Media. 
				</B>
				<P>
				Perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the opinion was the Court's repeated affirmation of the "unique" nature of the Internet as a communications medium. All three judges based their legal conclusions in part on the unique features of the Internet. Factors supporting lesser First Amendment protection for other media like broadcast are simply not present in cyberspace. Judge Sloviter wrote that "Internet communication, while unique, is more akin to telephone communication . . . than to broadcasting . . . because . . . an Internet user must act affirmatively and deliberately to retrieve specific information online. Even if a broad search will, on occasion, retrieve unwanted materials, the user virtually always receives some warning of its content, significantly reducing the element of surprise or 'assault' involved in broadcasting." Judge Dalzell agreed, writing that "the Government may well be right that sexually explicit content is just a few clicks of a mouse away from the user, but there is an immense legal significance to those few clicks." Judge Buckwalter wrote that the unique nature of the medium was also crucial to his holding that the CDA is unconstitutionally vague. 
				<P>
				While all three judges recognized the distinct nature of the Internet, Judge Dalzell went one giant step further. The special characteristics of the Internet led him to conclude that the First Amendment denies Congress the power to regulate protected speech on the Internet. He wrote, "[T]he disruptive effect of the CDA on Internet communication, as well as the CDA's broad reach into protected speech, not only render the Act unconstitutional but also would render unconstitutional any regulation of protected speech on this new medium." Any content-based regulation of the Internet, no matter how benign the purpose, "could burn the global village to roast the pig." Judge Dalzell's language should make Congress hesitate before attempting to pass a "son of CDA." 
				<P>
				<B>
					The CDA Would Devastate the Online Medium. 
				</B>
				<P>
				Judge Dalzell noted that four features of Internet communication were crucial to the judges' shared holding that the CDA is unconstitutional on its face: "First, the Internet presents very low barriers to entry. Second, these barriers to entry are identical for both speakers and listeners. Third, as a result of these low barriers, astoundingly diverse content is available of the Internet. Fourth, the Internet provides significant access to all who wish to speak in the medium, and even creates a relative parity among speakers." Given these characteristics, Judge Dalzell wrote that "[i]t is no exaggeration to conclude that the Internet has achieved, and continues to achieve, the most participatory marketplace of mass speech that this country -- and indeed the world -- has yet seen." 
				<P>
				Judge Dalzell then went on to paint a realistic picture of the effect the CDA would have on the "substantive, speech-enhancing benefits that have flowed from the Internet." He found that barriers to entry would "skyrocket, especially for non-commercial and not-for-profit information providers." The diversity of content would necessarily diminish as a result, and "the Internet would ultimately come to mirror broadcasting and print, with messages tailored to a mainstream society from speakers who could be sure that their message was likely decent in every community in the country." Finally, the CDA would "skew the relative parity among speakers that currently exists on the Internet." Commercial entities who could afford the costs of age verification would survive, but other users like Critical Path or Stop Prisoner Rape could be shut out of the marketplace of ideas. The First Amendment, said Judge Dalzell, simply would not tolerate such a devastating effect on such a democratizing new medium. 
				<P>
				<B>
					Affirmation of First Amendment Principles: 
				</B>
				<P>
				The decision in 
				<U>
					ACLU v. Reno 
				</U>
				does much more than extend free speech rights to cyberspace -- it gives new life to basic First Amendment principles. The importance of protecting the right of non-profit, non-commercial speakers is emphasized throughout the opinion. In addition, Judge Dalzell eloquently affirmed the vitality of an unfettered marketplace of ideas: "Speech on the Internet can be unfiltered, unpolished, and unconventional, even emotionally charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar -- in a word, 'indecent,' in many communities. But we should expect such speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a voice. We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium confers to ordinary people as well as media magnates." He continued, "The absence of governmental regulation of Internet content has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of plaintiffs' experts put it with such resonance at the hearing: 'What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet is. The strength of the Internet is that chaos.' Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the First Amendment protects."

<h1>AOL Transcript 1/25/96 Mike Farrell </h1>
<h5>Copyright 1996 America Online, Inc.</h5>
<p><b> 
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Welcome Mike!
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Can you tell us some more about your activism?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Thanks very much, K, nice to be here.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Sure.  I have opposed the death penalty for as long as I can
remember, but became much more active in my work against it during the late
'70s, when the return of executions in this country post-Furman was feared.
 From that point I've done a lot of speaking around the country, and have
been involved with the cases of a number of individuals on death row.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We are also joined by David Riley an ACLU host and a
co-moderator for our vigil tonight.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Say hi, David.
 <p> <b>
 Driley7     :</b> ::bows : :  :)
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Audience members, you may send your questions and comments to
David. You should also know that we may be bringing people up on stage to
talk one-on-one to Mike Farrell. But, let's get to the questions.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> The first comes from ToddS67 who asks..
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> what motivated you to get involved in this issue?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Well, as I indicated, I've always felt killing people was
immoral.  The killing of people by the state seems to me to be just as
immoral as that done in the heat of passion, if not more so.  More than
that, it seems to me that state killing teaches people that the answer to
violence is violence, and that will get us nowhere fast.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Okay, the next question comes from Pgacds and asks a tough
question.
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b>  how would you deal with habitual offenders?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Clearly, some people, by their actions, indicate that they are
incapable of behaving in an appropriate manner.  That being so, I think they
have to be separated from society for as long as is necessary in order for
them to be rehabilitated.  In some, very sad, cases, that may mean for the
rest of their lives.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Thanks, Mike.  I have a question.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Sure.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> How does all this publicity-mongering around the execution
reflect on us?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Well, I guess that depends upon what you mean.  If you are
asking about how it makes us look to the rest of the world, I'd say it
paints a very sad picture. Even here at home, I think the sensationalism
around death-dealing creates an atmosphere of violence. 
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Okay, next comment from Wiredwill who writes
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> People are going to die anyway. The point is to fill life with
compassion, not aggression. More sticks don't put out the fire. Way to go Mike.
 <p> <b>
KeenanCLU   :</b> Not quite a question, but the encouragement is appreciated.
<p> <b> 
 MikefDPF    :</b> Thanks very much.  I agree that what we need is more
understanding and more thoughtful interaction.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Here's sort of an odd question, but I'm curious to hear your
reply.
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Not that it matters much, but WHY would someone choose the
firing squad over lethal injection?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Of course it's not possible to get into the head of one in the
incredibly stressful situation that is death row, but I think we first of
all have to understand that that situation produces inappropriate behavior
in and of itself.  In this case, as Utah law allows the condemned person
that choice, and as I think he's aware of the furor that is likely to result
from what is obviously a barbaric response on the part of this government,
it may be that he wants to make a statement in his choice.  Either way I
think we have to understand that this is state-assisted suicide.  Nothing
more, nothing less.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> I don't think that is the sort of business we ought to be in
as a civilized country.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> The next question is from Highland who is concerned about his
taxes...
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> What about people like Charles Manson, who has made it clear
that if let out would kill again? Why should taxpayers pay for the upkeep of
such criminals? 
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> What the questioner needs to understand is that keeping a
hopelessly wounded (psychically) person in prison for life is much cheaper
than executing him or her.  Studies show that it costs three to four times
as much to execute as it does to imprison for life.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Then there is the question of the moral price that we as a
society pay for doing murder.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We'll be looking to bring some folks up on stage soon.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Happy to meet them.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> In the meantime, Mike, tell us a little bit about the details
of the execution. 
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> What I understand,  at least in this case, is that he will be
strapped into a chair with a wall behind it and a tray beneath it (for the
blood).  A wall  before him will have holes in it for the shooters to aim
their weapons through.  All but one of the shooters will have live
ammunition - one will have a blank cartridge.  No one will know who had the
blank. I think that fact alone suggests an awareness, perhaps unconscious,
of the wrongness of the act. 
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b>  At the order, all will fire at a designated spot on Mr.
Taylor's chest - over his heart.  One study showed that death by firing
squad in Utah has historically taken between a few seconds and 27 minutes to
cause the death of the individual.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Here's an interesting one...
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Isn't it (the firing squad) at least more honest?  It doesn't
sanitize the killing.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> I agree that it doesn't sanitize the killing.  that also
doesn't make it right.  It is a throwback to an earlier time in our country,
I think, but it causes the same result.  It's not an &quot;honesty&quot; that I
appreciate, frankly.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Okay, we are inviting the staff attorney for the ACLU of Utah
on stage now. Perhaps she can give us an update on the goings-on there and
on the rally which took place today.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> She should be here any moment.  In the meantime, let's take
another question..
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Can you explain that answer better...re :  cheaper to keep
alive in prison than execute?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Sure.  the Supreme Court has said that &quot;death is different.&quot;
As a result of that fact and the fear of doing wrong by executing innocent
people, they have instituted certain required procedures in capital cases.
Bifurcated trials, for instance, which means a two-part trial - one part to
determine guilt and one part to determine sentence.  All of this, plus the
required appeals that must be allowed by law (hopefully to ferret out the
mistaken convictions) make the process very lengthy and very expensive.
Life in prison, on the other hand, requires only a simple trial and, if
found guilty, the sentence to be carried out, without many of the appeals.
It is infinitely less expensive.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Okay, we now have Jensie Anderson, the staff attorney for the
ACLU of Utah on stage with us.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Welcome Jensie! Do you have an update for us?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Actually, let me add, that in California alone, we would save
between $90 and $120,000,000 per year by simply eliminating the death penalty.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Thank you.  An honor to be here.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> John Taylor is still committed to going through with his
execution despite the best efforts of myself and other attorneys and
abolitionists. At this point, it is unlikely that a last minute appeal will
be filed.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> What does that mean then, Jensie?  What will be happening
between now and midnight your time? 
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> At this point, they are preparing for the execution. His
attorneys are still with him in hopes of a last minute appeal. However, John
is determined to end his life this evening.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Jensie, has he said why he has elected the firing squad?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> For several reasons.  First, I think he wanted to bring some
attention to his case, particularly to draw attention to the barbaric
conditions at the prison here. It was also a method he chose when he was
sentenced six years ago.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Jensie, is it true John Albert Taylor converted to Catholicism
last week?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> He has been studying Catholicism for over a year, and was
baptized last week.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> How does religion play into this whole story?  what's the
feeling in Utah?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Historically, the firing squad was used for &quot;blood atonement&quot;
which is of religious significance in Utah.  It involves the spilling of
blood in repentance for the crime of murder
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Taylor was a Mormon, is that correct?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> however, for John, there is no religious significance.  He is
focusing on the hereafter with his priest.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> He was a mormon, but was excommunicated when he was convicted.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> However, we should say that many Mormons are very horrified by
this execution by firing squad as well.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Yes, they are.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike or Jensie, how do most religious organizations come out
on the death penalty?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> All the mainstream religious organizations are opposed to the
death penalty.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> The Catholic diocese here in Utah has actively participated in
the abolitionist movement.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Jensie, hang on with us here a little longer.  We're going to
take another question for Mike.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> The US Bishops conference recently took a very strong stand
against the death penalty, as did the Pope
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Mike, I was pro-death penalty until Nebraska recently executed
a confessed killer. Unfortunately the entire episode turned into a political
carnival.  After the execution was completed, people were dancing and
cheering in Lincoln.  Yet my original question remains.  Why not work to
stop abortion which is claiming a much higher toll? 
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> i think it's a different question.  You certainly have every
right to work against abortion, and many, as you know, do.  the killing of
living, already born, human beings is a sign of total barbarism, in my view,
and one I choose to stand against.  The other question is a private one, in
my view, between a woman and her doctor.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Let's take another question.
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Mike - Don't you find it ironic that one blank will be fired,
so that each shooter may feel that they weren't part of the execution - in
so far as that is an acknowledgement that there is something inherently
wrong *with* the execution?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Yes, I agree totally.  I think it's a confession, of sorts,
that they are aware of the wrongheadedness of what they're doing.  I only
wish they'd accept that and move to a better place.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> If you are just joining us, you are at the ACLU's online vigil
for John Albert Taylor who is to be executed at midnight in Utah. 
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike Farrell, actor and activist is on stage with us for the
duration of the vigil. We will be here from 12-3 a.m. EST.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We are also joined by the ACLU of Utah's staff attorney,
Jensie Anderson.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Our co-moderator David Riley is taking your questions and
comments and will be inviting members of the audience on stage to talk with
Mike and Jensie. In the meantime, let's get back to your questions and comments.
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> What did this person do to get this type of sentence?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Perhaps Jensie can better answer.  As I understand it, he was
convicted of murdering a young girl. There may have been sexual acts
involved as well.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> He was convicted of the murder of a young girl.  He maintains
his innocence.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Is there any reason to believe he is innocent?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> The trial was handled very poorly.  No jury and his attorneys
had never handled a capitol case before.  No experts or witnesses were
brought on his behalf. He has very good issues should he choose to continue
his appeals.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> You see, this is the problem with the whole issue.  WE find
time after time that those convicted had lousy representation, or none at
all, and no way to actually know if the party is guilty of the act.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> But, at this time, he won't be doing that?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Even prison guards, who are generally pro death penalty, feel
this is wrong. The prison has had to offer psychological counseling for the
staff as a result.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> No, he has chosen to stop the appeals process.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We have with us now an audience participant who may not feel
the same as all you liberals! Howdy SSI, do you have some comments?
 <p> <b>
 SSIMAGIC    :</b> Isn't the death penalty more for the victim than society?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> I don't understand the question.
 <p> <b>
 SSIMAGIC    :</b> We are not try for rehabilitation, we are extracting justice.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Justice is intended to be fair and appropriate.  What you're
talking about is vengeance.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> What is the harm in trying to rehabilitate someone who has
gone wrong?
 <p> <b>
 SSIMAGIC    :</b> Retribution or vengeance is the whole reason for the death
penalty, it is designed to prevent future acts of extreme violence.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> If I may, the victim does not benefit from the death of the
accused.  Indeed, in this case the mother of the victim does not support the
death of John Taylor.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> The notion of killing to prevent future acts of violence on
the part of an individual is tantamount to suggesting that we can pick out
personality types that are likely to do crimes and eliminate them in
advance. What kind of society does that?
 <p> <b>
 SSIMAGIC    :</b> In Vietnam I was forced to kill, I didn't like it, but it did
keep friends alive. What is the difference? 
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Vietnam was a war.  People were, at least in theory, shooting
at you.  What you did was to defend yourself and/or your friends.  this is
not the same.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Is that the case here, though, SSI? 
 <p> <b>
 SSIMAGIC    :</b> Yes, by executing this man we are defending my daughter.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> This is taking a human being, caging him, telling him we're
going to kill him, torturing him with that knowledge and going through the
ritual of pre-execution activities until we have assuaged our consciences
enough to feel we've done all we can. Then we kill.  How does that help your
daughter?
 <p> <b>
 SSIMAGIC    :</b> What did he do to that 11 year year old?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> If you were listening, he says he didn't do anything to that
11 year old.  but even if he did, how is she served by doing a form of the
same thing to him?
 <p> <b>
 SSIMAGIC    :</b> It keeps him from being like the case in Texas where the man
escaped and killed again.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Are other children served by seeing society kill? 
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> I know of no such case in Texas.  The idea of killers escaping
comes from too much bad fiction.
 <p> <b>
 SSIMAGIC    :</b> I believe they could be served by seeing it instead of hiding
it from the press.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> How would they be served?
 <p> <b>
 SSIMAGIC    :</b> No sir, He was even on America's most wanted, captured him
from a tip
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> If what you say is true, and I'm not sure it is, does one
anomalous incident justify our killing the 3000 people we have on our death
rows today?  Some of them are innocent, some are mentally retarded, most are
mentally damaged in one form or another.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> What time is it in Utah, Jensie?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> 11 :05
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Where exactly is the execution to take place?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> It will take place at the prison, in a specially prepared
warehouse. John is currently in a death watch cell.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Folks, you are at the ACLU's online vigil for John Albert
Taylor who is sentenced to be executed in one hour by firing squad.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We are joined by MASH's Mike Farrell, actor and activist.  And
by Jensie Anderson, ACLU staff attorney in Utah. 
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike, this isn't the first unique execution this week, is it?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> As I understand it, a man was hanged in Delaware this week.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Jensie, are folks commenting on that execution in Utah?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> There is a lot of discussion here.The legislature is
considering a bill to eliminate the firing squad.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Perhaps replacing it with stoning?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Is it likely to pass?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Actually, it is wallowing, presumably because of its religious
significance
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Let's take an interesting question...
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Do you believe  MASH was too violent and changed peoples views
on death?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> I believe that one is for Mike. Sorry, Jensie.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> No, I think MASH was reflective of the situation of a war and
showed people trying to lend a helping healing hand in that situation. I'm
not sure what you mean about changing people's views on death.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU :</b> The next question is  from Dewdropper, who comments..
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> I know that the death penalty is rather cruel and unusual,
however, what other deterrent should our government use to make criminals
respect the law?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Life in prison is one possibility.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> There are a multitude of options.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Having elected officials respect the law is another.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike and Jensie, here's a particularly interesting question
from AABrewer...
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> I was in UT a couple of years ago when Warren Andrews was put
to death. He wasn't merely martyred, he was made out to be a hero. Some
forgot completely about the crimes he committed, and lost sight of the issue
at hand. How do we keep that from happening?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> First of all, it was William Andrews.  I know of no one who
wanted to make him a hero, but I know many who felt that the punishment did
not fit the crime. You may be aware of the fact that Mr. Andrews was not in
the room when the people in question were killed.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> I agree with you that it's important to not lose sight of the
issue at hand.  But I think the issue at hand is our humanity.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike, here's one..
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Is this an act visited upon whites in Utah more than people of
color?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Jensie?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> More than 2,800 men and women were imprisoned on death rows in
the U.S by mid-1994.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> I can tell you that it is visited on people of color in the
country in numbers disproportionate to their percentage in the population.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Whites represent 35 percent of murder victims, but the
overwhelming majority, 85%, were convicted of killing whites. Whites have
rarely been sentenced to death for killing blacks.  Indeed, since the death
penalty was reinstated in 1977 only one white has died for killing a black.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We have with us on stage, KateHM.  Kate do you have questions
or comments?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Kate, don't be afraid to speak up.  We're going to take
another question in the meantime.
  <p> <b>
KeenanCLU   :</b> Sorry for the blank air there folks.  AOL.. you understand
<p> <b> 
 Question    :</b> Would you have this much compassion for those on death row if
one of your family members was a victim?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Of course, if one of my family members was a victim I'd be
angry and want to tear the individual apart but the reason we have a system
of justice is to separate our personal emotional response from the
imposition of justice.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Murder Victim's Families for Reconciliation is an organization
made up of victim's families and they all know there is no value in
continuing the spiral of violence.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Many of the members of Death Penalty Focus have lost family
members to violence.  They maintain that the death penalty lowers us all to
the level of the original perpetrator of the violent act.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike, what is this thing people sign saying they do not want
anyone executed because of them? That is, if they or their family members
are killed by someone?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> There is a pledge, made up by a group of religious women in
the east, called a pledge to life, or something like that.  It simply says,
if I am murdered, I do not want my murderer to die at the hands of the
state.  I do not want the killing to continue in the name of pursuing
justice on my behalf.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Kate is with us now.  Kate do you have a comment?
 <p> <b>
 KateHM      :</b> Yes ... first of all, I would like to mention that I am
adamantly opposed to the death penalty and I lost an uncle to murder ....
 <p> <b>
 KateHM      :</b> My uncle was murdered as a part of a &quot;crime spree.&quot; .... I've
since learned that the death penalty is NOT a deterrent to criminals of this
variety ... they reason that they can only be &quot;fried&quot; once, so why not kill
ALL the witnesses at every crime ....
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Do you know of MVFR?  Murder Victim's Families for Reconciliation?
 <p> <b>
 KateHM      :</b> Yes, I've heard of the group Mike ....
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Kate, hold on one moment, Jensie is going to leave us now.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> You can reach them, if you choose, at 2093 Willow Creek Rd.,
Portage, IN 46368
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Jensie Anderson, staff attorney for the ACLU of Utah, can you
give us one more update before you go?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Thank you for this opportunity.  I have spent a great deal of
time with John Albert Taylor and need to be there in spirit for him.  I'll
return after the execution.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Go with God, Jensie
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Thank you Jensie.  We'll check in with you later.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Thank you.  Its 11 :30 now.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We are looking for people to come up who support the death
penalty.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> We are still keeping the hope here.  Thank you again.
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> I'm here in Utah with ACLU board member Perry Anderson.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Welcome Emily Whitfield, deputy media director of the ACLU.
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> We've seen the downside of capital punishment this week. Media
here from all over the world...all of them appalled that America still
supports and implements the death penalty.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> I think it's important for our audience to know that we stand
alone among Western industrial democracies in continuing this awful practice.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Why are the international media so compelled by this case?
Mike, Emily?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Because we are theoretically a civilized country that believes
in human rights, but we do this.
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> As  German TV pointed out to us, they live with the memory of
govt-sponsored mass murder
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> It's also important to understand that those countries used to
have the death penalty and have left it behind.  And their crime rates have
gone down.
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> Has anyone mentioned also that in the U.S. death penalty
states' crime rates are the same or lower after it is instituted?  Not a
deterrent!
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Crime rates in non-death states are lower.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We are looking to bring up on stage now a former parole
officer with mixed feelings about the death penalty.
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> True Mike.  People need to know this.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Welcome, parole officer.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Oh well, we would've had he stuck around.  But, please keep
trying folks. WE're going through your questions and comments as fast as we
can and we ARE looking to bring up people who disagree with the ACLU on this.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Please.  It's only by reaching out to those who disagree that
we're going to change things.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Emily, here's an easy one, why does the ACLU oppose the death
penalty?
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> Because it's cruel and unusual punishment.  Think  about the
last minute appeals, the uncertainty -- in some countries they perform mock
executions as a form of torture.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> The dehumanizing impact on the society at large is something
more need to know about.  Emily, can you tell us more about the staff at the
prison being given psychological help regarding this execution?
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> the government does not have the right to take an individual's
life, even if they are punishing those who themselves killed.
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> I don't know specifically about the Utah prison staff, but I
do know that guards and wardens that have participated in executions have
experienced deep psychological trauma.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Jensie mentioned the guards there being upset by and opposed
to this killing.  And getting help.
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> Major coverage out at the prison...KSL TV has been doing a
special show...local stations have been interviewing non-stop.  We've had
many opportunities to get out the ACLU word. In fact Perry Anderson was
interviewed at St. Ann's church this evening (Utah board member).
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Let's take a question..
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> We don't care about money its about retribution. Why not put
them to sleep for a lifetime?
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> Why not ask for restitution instead of retribution?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> &quot;Vengeance is mine&quot; who said that?
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> What about turn the other cheek?  A famous death row prisoner
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Who are we to make the decision as to who is to be &quot;put to
sleep for a lifetime&quot;?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Oh, here's one for you civil libertarians!
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> If this man is committed to going through with it, why are you
sticking your nose in it? Where are you when Kevorkian is aiding a suicide?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> The question should be reversed.  The same people who are
trying to put Dr. Kevorkian in jail are trying to assist this man to kill
himself.  What is the logic?
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> The state does not have the right to kill or to decide whether
an individual should end his life
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> A personal decision between a sick individual and his or her
family and doctor is not equivalent to the state killing a human being at
its election.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> In fifteen minutes, 5 police officers will enter a dark room
with a little window...and fire at John Albert Taylor... at a little circle
on his chest..
 <p> <b>
 Emilyclu    :</b> They've refined the process since Gary Gilmore but  it's still
barbaric...maybe even more so because the machinery of death has become so
sophisticated.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We have now with us WH6EF who supports the death penalty.  WH,
any comments or thoughts you want to share with us?
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> I noticed earlier that an argument against it was the expense
of the endless appeals...
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> No, I didn't say anything about &quot;endless appeals&quot;, I spoke of
Supreme Court mandated appeals
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> yet when a criminal goes through those appeals and the death
penalty is upheld, you all oppose his death as cruel and unusual, or other
such things.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Joe Spaziano has been on Death Row in Florida for 20 years.
Has had a great number of appeals.  He's had five execution dates.  Last
week a federal judge looked at some evidence for the first time and ordered
a new trial.  That's why.
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> When is enough proof enough?  When is a crime heinous enough?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We have to say goodbye to Emily Whitfield now. ACLU's deputy
media director. Thank you for coming.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> It's not a question of &quot;enough.&quot;  It's a question of not
playing God.  If you're sure they're guilty put them away for life.  Murder
doesn't solve anything.
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> How about Singapore?  One of the safest areas of the
world...They execute drug runners there.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Great, go to Singapore.  Just don't spit on the sidewalk.
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> Perhaps too extreme for my taste, but doesn't it fly in the
face of your statistics?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> WH, tell me, a human is about to be shot in the heart by five
gunmen. That doesn't bother you?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> No, it doesn't.  They also execute maids who are accused of
crimes for which there is no proof.
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> What he did to the girl bothers me.  I have 6 and 8 y/o girls
here.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> In ten minutes, WH.  Would you pull the trigger yourself, WH?
nine minutes, WH.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> And they deserve to be protected by the laws of the society in
which they live.  By humane laws in a humane society.
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> IF I were on a jury and were given sufficient evidence I would
recommend the death penalty.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> If John Albert Taylor were to be held in prison for the rest
of his life, he would do no harm to your younger sisters.
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> IF I were a Utah law officer and it was a necessity, I would
do it, yes.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Who makes it a necessity?
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> My daughters, Mike  :)
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Eight minutes, WH?  Are you sure?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Your daughters are asking that this man be killed?
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> Yes.  If the legal mechanism has been satisfied, and it has.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> You have a rifle on your shoulder aimed at man's heart.
Picture it, WH.  seven minutes.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> If the legal mechanism was changed so that the ultimate
sanction was life in prison without parole?
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> Then that would be the appropriate punishment.  I'm not out
for blood.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Good point, Mike.  You can either shoot this human being
yourself or lock him up forever.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> You see, it is up to us to make that change so that we do not
stoop to the level of the killers.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> six minutes, WH.  What do you say? life in prison or are you
going to kill him?
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> But the people in this country support the death penalty.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Not when they understand there are effective options.
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> He has been sentenced to death.  I support the most severe
penalty for his crime.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Is it the killing of another human being that you are ready to
take on for yourself?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Then we must change the law so that the ultimate penalty
punishes the wrongdoer and still allows us our humanity.
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> I don't want to take it on myself, to &quot;play God&quot; as you keep
putting it.  I agree with what punishment is meted out by the legal
system.In this case it's death.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> The legal system is US.  We keep being told by politicians
that everyone wants death.  They don't when they understand there are
effective options. That's the point.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Why not life in prison, WH?  three minutes
  <p> <b>
WH6EF       :</b> Taylor took on the role of God, not me.
<p> <b> 
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Are you a Christian, WH?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Taylor, if he did this, did a reprehensible thing. We, the
state, are taking on the role of God.
 <p> <b>v
 WH6EF       :</b> Not true, Mike.  Didn't I see a poll recently that showed
60-70 percent of Americans supporting the death penalty?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Only when asked up or down on death.  When asked if they would
support options, humane options, they support them by a majority.
 <p> <b>
 WH6EF       :</b> So then you agree, most Americans DO support the death penalty.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Any poll can bias a response.  If asked the simple question,
most people respond out of fear.  I'm saying we have to be leaders and make
this our country.  Make it be the country it's supposed to be.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> WH6EF, Okay, thank you for  joining us. We appreciate your
honesty.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike, my clock just turned to midnight.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> A sad thing is happening as we speak.  The State of Utah, and
all of us, are being brought to the level of this poor man at his worst moment.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Folks, you may want to turn on your radios while you stay at
the computer.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> There is no glory in this act.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> The shooting is scheduled to take place at one minute after
midnight. It might be happening right as you see these words come across.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Do you feel safer?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> I wonder if those who believe in an afterlife have asked
themselves what the victim of this crime, assuming she is in a place of
abiding love, would want us to be doing in her name now?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> According to the schedule, it is all over now.  We will bring
someone from Utah back on in a moment to update us.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Perhaps, something delayed the shooting.  Perhaps, John Taylor
decided to appeal.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> In the meantime, we'll take a question.
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Mike, do you feel that the death penalty is more for the
victims families &amp; society or just political knee-jerking?  Does it benefit
anybody?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> In my opinion it benefits no one.  Ambitious politicians have
been beating this drum for years
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> excuse me for the interruption, mike, an update
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> As of this moment, NBC is saying it hasn't happened yet - he's
&quot;en route.&quot;
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> now as a sop to frightened people, saying it will solve the
crime problem.  It will not.  It has not. What they have learned, though, is
it is a good way to get re-elected.  Fear does things to people.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> While we wait for further information, let's take another
question.
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Mike, have you ever been the victim of a brutal crime?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> I guess you'll have to define your terms.  What's your point?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> A moot question, Mike.  let's try another...
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Actually, as I think of it, I'm being made the victim of a
brutal crime right now.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> I'm getting an update.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> The warden asked taylor if he wanted to wear his eyeglasses
during the execution.  he declined.  he is now being led in to the
warehouse.An announcement is coming in a few moments, but the radio says it
may be another ten minutes.We'll keep you posted.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Sorry, Mike, here's another question...
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> The question was &quot;Would it be okay to shoot the man if I
caught him murdering and raping my daughter?&quot;
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> The law holds, I think, that that would be justifiable
homicide.  As to whether or not it would be &quot;okay,&quot; that's for you and your
conscience.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> CNN is now reporting that John Albert Taylor has been
executed. An announcement is coming over the radio now.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> May he rest in peace.  May we all rest in peace.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> John Taylor died 12 :07 mountain time. The first American
executed by firing squad since  Gary Gilmore 19 years ago.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Is the State of Utah a better place for this act?  A safer place?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We will be getting an update on the execution and Taylor's
last words in a moment. Stay with us.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> I hope some of you out there will ponder on this. The time we
have spent together here tonight has been focused on the intentional killing
of a human being by one of the United States of America.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Let's take some more of your questions for Mike Farrell.
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Mike, isn't revenge and retribution a part of human nature?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Some say so.  Others disagree.  What is clear is that a social
contract has to have agreed upon standards of behavior.  Killing is wrong,
we say. Then we do it.  Many are confused by the difference between the
words and the actions.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> There was a question about the victims.  We shouldn't forget
to speak of the horror that murder does leave for the families of the
murdered. Mike?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> We must grieve for the victims.  Of course.  But that doesn't
mean we should behave like their killers.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Some say we can come to a place of forgiveness.  I would hope
so, but that's up to the individual. But we must not allow ourselves, in our
grief, to become less than who we are.  We must not become the thing we
claim to despise.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We're online with actor and activist Mike Farrell, keeping
vigil on the now dead John Taylor. 
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> If indeed he was the killer of a small child, there is no
place for John Taylor to be loose in society. However, we are here to ask if
the death penalty serves us any better as a people than does life imprisonment.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike Farrell, whom you may know from MASH, has been working
for abolition of the death penalty for many years.  Please send your
questions and comments to our co-moderator, David Riley.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> If John Taylor committed the crime for which his life was
taken, perhaps in his death he can serve us by moving us to a place where we
finally recognize the futility of this kind of behavior on the part of the
state.  Perhaps the purpose he can serve is finally to awaken us to the
horror of our own practices here.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike, we're looking to bring some more folks up who support
the death penalty.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> ...and we've found one.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> If you were here earlier, you met Jensie Anderson, ACLU staff
attorney in Utah. Jensie, hello again, how are you holding up?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Okay.  Its a difficult thing, especially as a resident of the
state of Utah.  In a sense, we all had our fingers on the trigger
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> For those with us online, Jensie Anderson and her colleagues
around the country are the true heroes of this movement.  They give of
themselves in an incredibly powerful way, remembering the notion that &quot;as ye
treat these the least of my people ye treat also me&quot;.  I don't mean that we
all have to subscribe to a given religion or philosophical belief, but I
think it's important to understand and pay our respects to these people to
who reach out to those who are forgotten and despised.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Thank you Mike.  The same, and more can be said about you.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Jensie, how are you experiencing these events right now?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> The TV coverage here in Utah has stopped.  We are waiting for
the witnesses to return and then there will be a debriefing.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Where are you now, Jensie?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> I'm at home, watching television and dealing with this tragedy.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Are there many folks you know up tonight watching the events?
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> I believe that there are many people following the events of
this evening.  Its an important issue, not only to Utah, but nationwide.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Jensie, tell us a little bit about the events before the
execution.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Prior to the execution, the ACLU of Utah, Amnesty
International and the Catholic Diocese organized a number of events,
including a rally against the death penalty.  The national press has shown a
lot of interest and media coverage has been extensive.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> In addition, the organizations involved met with key
legislators and attempted to meet with the governor.
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> why are you holding a vigil for a man who raped and murdered a
little girl.  what if it was your daughter, think about where this country
is going, we need a stronger and faster death penalty process.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Sorry to interrupt Jensie.  Mike can you respond to that question?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> We are mourning the fact that a second murder has taken place.
And this is one we're responsible for. A &quot;stronger and faster&quot; death process
will simply kill more innocent people, more mentally retarded people, more
poor people who couldn't afford a defense.  The system is sick and we feel
that it must be fixed if we are to become the nation, the great nation, we
all believe in.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Another question for Mike Farrell at this ACLU's online vigil
for John Taylor.
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Mike, has this setback placed a renewed sense of urgency to
your cause?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> My sense of urgency is ever present because there are over
3000 people on death rows in the US today. I know we will, sadly, have more
executions in the future, but I think this issue is coming to the attention
of Americans like never before.  And I believe that we will finally get
people to wake up an and understand that they have to take responsibility
for the actions of their government and that they can't simply sit back and
let ambitious politicians make careers on the backs of poor, disadvantaged
and minority people who are singled out for death in this system.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Our co-moderator, David Riley, has an update.  David?
 <p> <b>
 Driley7     :</b> For those of you sending the &quot;what happened&quot; questions, John
Taylor was just executed in Utah. He is the first American to be executed by
firing squad in 19 years... over the strong objections of numerous civil
rights and human rights organizations.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> John Albert Taylor was pronounced dead at 12 :07 MST, put to
death by firing squad.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We're here with Mike Farrell, actor and activist, you may
remember him from MASH. Mike is an avid opponent of the death penalty and
has been here with us for ACLU's online vigil for almost 3 hours now.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Let's take some more of your questions...
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Have you determined that the demographics of those able to
afford AOL are generally, white, upper middle class, and without much
interest in moral imperatives, Mike?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> That irreverent question comes from BakervCar.
  <p> <b>
MikefDPF    :</b> My belief is that people are people.  When I have an
opportunity to reach out to them, wherever and whenever, I try to do so.
<p> <b> 
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We're taking your questions...and looking to bring some
pro-death penalty people up on stage.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Here's a decidedly tough one.
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> My brother was murdered recently. His killer is now on trial.
Is it, in your opinion, wrong of me to hope that this person be executed???
My brother was shot execution style, then burned to a shoe box full of
charred bones.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> It's not my place to say what's &quot;wrong&quot; of you.  I believe
that we are responsible for the actions of our society, and when we as a
society take a life, in much the same manner that you describe, we are
lowering ourselves to the level of the person for whom you feel such
loathing at this moment.  I am sorry about what happened to your brother and
I wish there was some way I could ease your pain.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> We have about 15 minutes left at this vigil. Again, John
Albert Taylor was executed at 12 :07 a.m. in Utah by firing squad.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Justice William Brennan said,  &quot;Even the vilest criminal
remains a human being possessed of common human dignity.&quot;  Let's try to
remember that when we think of John Taylor and all the others who are the
targets of society's rage.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Let's take some more of your questions.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> When Marie Deans, a founder of Murder Victims Families for
Reconciliation whose own family has been victimized by a murderer, was asked
why she opposed the death penalty she said &quot;I have the need to understand
why we are so good at passing on violence and so poor at passing on love.&quot;
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Here's a question from Waxxed78
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Sorry to interrupt you again. here's a question from Waxxed78..
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> Mike are you active against the death penalty just in the US
or around the world in other countries as well?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> I oppose the death penalty wherever it is implemented.  It is
not used in most developed countries.
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> If we are going to have executions should not they be on
television so America can see what a 'real' hanging or firing squad is like?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> That question comes from KirkClyat.  Thank you.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> There is blood and pain, the body loses control of its
functions and there is excrement and sweat and it is without dignity for any
and all involved.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> This next question is from BigDogher.
 <p> <b>
 Question    :</b> What do we do with these individuals?  The prisons are full
now.  You can't argue that these people should not walk the streets again,
can you?
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Some people can be transformed into useful citizens, of
course.  Others may not be.  We can and should separate dangerous, violent
people from society until they can behave properly.  Prisons today are
over-full of people who are not violent and who could be made to pay their
debt to society in more productive ways.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Thank you Mike Farrell.  And, thank you Jensie Anderson
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Jensie is a staff attorney for the ACLU of Utah and joins us
from her home.  Thanks for being here.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> Thanks, Kevin.  I'm willing to hang around for a few minutes
if you like.
 <p> <b>
 Jensieclu   :</b> Thank you.  It was an honor.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike, don't go away just yet.  Goodbye Jensie and thanks again.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike Farrell, actor and activist, has held vigil with the ACLU
for three hours now. John Albert Taylor was executed at 12 :07 a.m. in Utah
by firing squad.
 <p> <b>
 MikefDPF    :</b> I just want to have us think about Marie Deans' question.  Why
is it that we are so good at passing on violence and so poor at passing on love?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Thanks you all for your questions and participation.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Please be sure to check out the rest of the ACLU's
Constitution Hall at keyword ACLU.
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike, would you be willing to join the melee in the fully
interactive Free Speech Zone?
 <p> <b>
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Mike is considering moving over to the ACLU's interactive chat
room, the Free Speech Zone.
 <p> <b>
 Driley7     :</b> Of course, that is the decision everyone should make.   :)
  <p> <b>
KeenanCLU   :</b> Like he, all you will have to do is &quot;go to&quot; &quot;keyword&quot; &quot;ACLU&quot;
and enter the ACLU Live area.
<p> <b> 
 KeenanCLU   :</b> Thanks as well to David Riley who fielded your questions and
comments and brought you up here on stage.
 <p> <b>
 Driley7     :</b> Kevin, Mike... it was fun working with you.. and I want to
thank the members of our audience who joined us on stage  :)
 <p> <b>
 Driley7     :</b> Mike is in the Free Speech Zone... I guess if you want to see
his last words, you'll have to go there

<h1>AOL Transcript 12/20/95 Roberta Richman</h1>
<h5>Copyright 1995 America Online, Inc.</h5>
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Evening everyone. I'm Phil Gutis, the ACLU's media relations
director and slightly flustered host of our CenterStage series. I'm having some silly
technical woes tonight, but let's see how this goes.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Tonight, we're continuing our discussion about the nation's penal
system. Our guest is Roberta Richman, Warden of the Rhode Island Women's Prison. Let me say
a couple of words about Warden Richman and then we'll try to take your questions.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Roberta Richman is currently the Warden of Women's Facilities at the
Rhode Island Department of Corrections. She is a consistently progressive voice on female
offender issues. For Richman, an ideal alternative to incarceration of women
criminals would be placement in a community home or a safe, controlled environment that
would foster a healthy re-entry into society.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Warden Richman, let me open with the first question if I may. How
did you get involved in corrections in the first place?
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    I began working at the prison in 1979. My first job was as the coordinator of a
prison arts program, and I got it indirectly through doing volunteer work.  My previous
experience had been as a working artist and an instructor at the Univ. of Rhode  Island of
Fine Arts. The prison was looking someone to coordinate programs in the arts, and I was looking
for a full-time job.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking with Warden Roberta Richman. I've got my system
working again and our next question comes from Mike97ADA.
<p><b>
Question:</b> what kind of crimes are most women in for in Rhode Island?
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    Variety of crime...about 33% are serving sentences for drug
related offences.  We have people who are serving sentences for prostitution, shop lifting...the
majority...about 75%, not only in Rhode Island, but nationwide, are serving relatively shot
sentences for non-violent crimes.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking with Warden Roberta Richman of Rhode Island. Our next
question comes from Driley7.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Many people view prisons as places of punishment, others hope they
are places of rehabilitation. Can they be both? Should they be either?
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    To my way of thinking, the punishment is the incarceration itself... that is
separating a woman from her family and her community is the punishment. Once she's in jail, we
should be preparing her to rethink her life and gain the skills she will need to become a
responsible citizen.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Let me ask the next question: To what do you attribute the current
anger or meanspiritness that seems to be sweeping America when it comes to criminal justice?
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    That's a very troubling issue for me. The climate, in general, is, I think, a reaction
to growing violence in the community and pervasive fear. I think people are simply fearful of
offenders on the street, and see prison as an answer. Those of us working in system understand
all to well that simply putting a violent offender will not solve the problem. People fail to realize
that most offenders are in prison for a relatively short period of time.  The average length of
sentence is approximately 2-1/2 years. If we fail to provide an opportunity for prisoners while
they are institutionalized to rehabilitate themselves, they will emerge even more violent.
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    I'm not sure that we can ever make the public truly understand that.  The level of
their anger presently is just to deep.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question for Warden Roberta Richman comes from Gumby1618
and is a follow up.
<p><b>
Question:</b> What form of education or work training do you offer the inmates
for when they are released so they can have a more productive life?
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    Every prison does different kinds of programs. Most prisons now do offer
educational opportunities and some job training, recognizing that lack of skills in those areas is a
root cause of crime. Prisoners in general have usually not completed a high-school education. 
About 22% of them are functionally illiterate and in the case of female offenders, the vast
majority have never held meaningful jobs. We do a variety of basic education programs,
including basic literacy, high-school equivalency, English as a second language, special ed. and
some college classes.
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    We also do job training and job preparation, computer literacy, and preparation
for job interviewing.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question for Warden Richman comes from Britron.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Roberta, I worked Atlanta Pre-trial detention center and I found
that many of those women are cold and hard and don't accept rehab.  Some do.  But by
softening sentences, don't you agree that we give carte-blanche to additional criminal
behavior??? 
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    I don't think you can generalize. It is very difficult to measure when a woman is
truly ready for treatment. I don't believe in softening sentences, but it's important to define what
you mean by softening. I support sentences that involve high structured treatment, to include
substance abuse, mental health counseling, academic and job training.
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    The length of a woman's sentence is not as critical as is what she does while she's
incarcerated. I don't think any sentence is soft. The restriction of freedom, and the separation,
usually from children, in my mind, can never be soft.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question comes from SocWorker.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Would you say that the sentences for women are more or less severe
for women than men?
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    The length of the sentences and the number of women incarcerated, during the
decade of the '80's and into the 90's, increased about 300%, which exceeded the increase for
males. It's hard to say whether that increase is a reflection of equality or harsher treatment.  I
think women are receiving more or less similar sentences then men, but are committing, for the
most part, less serious and less violent crimes, so it may appear as though they are getting less
harsh sentences.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question for Warden Roberta Richman comes from Edelmaus.
<p><b>
Question:</b> What is your reaction to people who claim that prisoners live lives of "luxury"
with amenities such as "cable tv and weight rooms"?
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    I find that whole sentiment to be absurd. Prison environments are very difficult to
manage, and having worked for 12 years in a male maximum security prison, I had many
opportunities to understand fully how important it is to allow inmates to be physically active and
occupy idle time in a positive way. Inmates who are watching TV or working out in a weight
room are far less likely to be involved in negative behavior. Although the public perceives those
activities as coddling, prison administrators and correctional officers understand how important
they are to institution management.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question comes from Geomandel and is a follow up to the earlier
question about job training and educational opportunity.
<p><b>
Question:</b> do any of these inmates recognize the courses as major opportunities?
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    You can't generalize.  Inmates are people. Some of them sincerely appreciate the
opportunities we provide, and others see it as a way to pass time, or please the parol board. It's
difficult to know what motivates inmates. My general philosophy is regardless of why a woman
chooses to participate in a program, if, as a result her skills are enhanced, and she takes
something away with her, we have all benefited.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Another question from Edelmaus for Warden Roberta Richman.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Is there any evidence that the death penalty deters crime, either
in its present form, or in the "swifter, more efficient" form currently being proposed by
the far right?
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    I am against the death penalty. I don't believe it serves as a deterrent, and am
grateful that we don't have it in Rhode Island. I don't believe that there is any evidence that it
serves any good purpose.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  An interesting question from SocWorker.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Do you believe that legalizing prostitution would help to relieve
prison crowding and that regulating it as a business would help to protect women?
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    This is an unpopular position I take, but as is the case in many countries around
the world, where prostitution is not considered a crime, and where it is controlled it works well.
The most frustrating aspect of criminalizing prostitution is that only the female is punished.  The
"John" goes home to his family, and generally pays no price. Given today's high risk behavior
around HIV and AIDS, a sensible public policy around this issue is essential. 
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    I've never met a prostitute that told me she likes the work. For most of them, it's a
means to an end.  They do it because it's the only skill they have. 
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  And I'll jump in with the next question: Where do you see the criminal justice
system headed? Chain gangs, stripped privileges? Is another Attica far away?
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    I guess that will depend on who sets public policy, and given the direction many
prisons are headed in, it's a frightening prospect. Whenever I have opportunity to shape opinion
on this question, I stress the need for intermediate sanctions. While I do believe there is a need
to incarcerate the most violent of our offenders, the majority, and in particular the majority of
female offenders, should be in settings other then the institution.  I think this is the case for both
male and female inmates who have committed non-violent crimes. I don't think we can afford,
either morally or fiscally, to incarcerate every offender.
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    We would all be so much better off if we could separate out those who are ready
for and capable of restarting their lives by placing them in environments in the community
and helping them to reintegrate in a responsible fashion.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Our last question for Warden Roberta Richman comes from Edelmaus.
<p><b>
Question:</b> What is your experience with groups like Colson's "Prison Fellowship"? Do you
find such conservative Christian groups to be helpful or harmful? 
<p><b>
RbrtaRchmn:</b>    We have an extensive chaplaincy program representing many faiths. The "Prison
Fellowship" program is not represented in our prison, so I'm not very familiar with it. However
I'm a strong supporter of any force that serves to give the offender hope for his or her future. If
the "Prison Fellowship" does that, then it may be serving some good for some people.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Please join me in thanking Warden Roberta Richman for sharing her
perspective on this critically important topic. And remember, please join us in the ACLU's Free
Speech Zone at any time day or night to discuss criminal justice or anything else on your mind.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Goodnight everyone. Have a merry or happy!

<h1>AOL Transcript Chase Riveland</h1>
<h5>Copyright 1995 America Online, Inc.</h5>
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Good evening everyone. After a little bit of confusion, we're ready
to start our event tonight. I'm Phil Gutis, the host of the ACLU CenterStage events and
the ACLU's Media Relations Director. We have a special -- and some would say
unexpected -- guest tonight: Chase Riveland, the Secretary of the Washington Stage Department
of Corrections. 
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Riveland has been involved in corrections for more than 30 years,
holding a variety of positions in Wisconsin, Colorado and Washington. He has also served as a
probation and parole agent.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  I'd like to start the questions tonight, if I may: Secretary
Riveland, how would you characterize the current atmosphere regarding our penal system in
America?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     In a short term I think its "cranky." Unfortunately as people struggle to find
solutions for drugs violence and crime, they've settled on incarceration as the singular solution and
have failed to address severe problems in our communities that could lead to real solutions. The
net effect is to burden our justice system at all levels to put our states and local jurisdictions in a
situation of investing massive amounts of money in prisons that could be well directed toward
other social, environmental, and educational uses.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking about prisons and prisoners rights with the Secretary of Corrections
of Washington State, Chase Riveland. The next question comes from DWhite1974.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Chase, doesn't the "lock 'em up and throw away the key" approach -- the kind
advocated by pandering politicians today -- just make criminals slicker and more bitter when they
re-enter society?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     In many cases that's true. However, we all need to take some responsibility for the
present environment.  We have allowed the political environment to become one that doesn't
allow even thoughtful politicians the opportunity to develop constructive policies around crime,
drugs, and violence. We all need to help level the playing field so that the thoughtful
officials can take that risk.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Our topic tonight is the nation's penal system. Our guest is Chase
Riveland, Secretary of  Corrections of Washington State. The next question comes from
SterlingEE.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Chase,  what will be the effect on the number of Blacks under
correctional control if we spend $10 billion more to construct prisons in the next 5 years as
the GOP proposes?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     It is my belief it will simply be a continuation of the trend we've seen over the last
few years. I believe the bureau of Justice Statistics report recently released indicated that for the
first time in this countries history, blacks in prisons and jails country wide now out number whites.
As long as we continue to incarcerate drug offenders at the rates we are and depend upon
incarceration for all of our justice problems that trend will  only get worse. The $10 billion could
be used to provide opportunities in our inner cities, significant amounts of drug treatment, and
educational and vocational opportunities that would have some chance of mitigating our crime
problem. Unfortunately, congress seems to be headed in exactly the opposite direction
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question for Chase Riveland of the Washington State Department of
Corrections comes from Mrs. OwlW and is, in some ways, a follow up.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How are we supposed to deal with the real issues when Congress and
state legislatures keep cutting programs that may actually help?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     It is my opinion that as we have taken the path of incarcerating so many people so
long, that our state legislators have been shocked at the money being diverted from other major
needs such as higher education and K- 12. Their response has been to cut traditional programs in
our correctional facilities and to create such noble statements as having inmates pay for everything
from recreation to health care despite the fact that few inmates have money. The net effect, I fear,
is we may return to the early era of prisons of the late 70's in which over crowded institutions
with little activity resulted in at best federal court intervention and at worst disturbances and riots.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question for Secretary Chase Riveland of Washington State
comes from Hyperkat.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Would you turn violent people lose on the population at large?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     Absolutely not. One of the things that a professionally operated prison can do best
is incapacitate predatory, violent and dangerous offenders. I have known many offenders over the
years that simply never should be returned to the community. My argument is not about those.
My argument is about young, nonviolent offenders, people who's major problem is addiction,
people who's major problem is the absence of opportunity. We need be prudent and selective on
our use of incarceration.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Raven 472 has the next question for Chase Riveland, Secretary of
Corrections in Washington State.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> With the overpopulation of prisons, do you think drugs should be legalized, since
most of the prison population is incarcerated on drug related offences?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     Certainly the country needs to look at all options in dealing with crime and drugs. I
suspect our solutions are somewhere between legalization and over incarceration. I am not
personally a proponent of legalization of all drugs, however my response to addiction, possession
and the accompanying problems should be something much different then today.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Here's an interesting question from Ahvienda for Chase Riveland of
Washington state that gets to the heart of the penal vs. corrections system.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> So, Mr. Riveland, are you suggesting that these criminals may be
"curable" to use a medical description?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     I am not suggesting that all criminals can be "treated." However a great body of
research suggests to us that in the singular area of substance addiction we can, with adequate
resources be quite successful in treating people in the community. Today, particularly at the state
level, we are incarcerating predominantly users and people who sell because they use, not the big
drug dealer. It is that group of people that I'm referencing.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question for Secretary Chase Riveland of the Washington
State Department of Corrections comes from Jimeo 722.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Most think prisons are too luxurious, with cable and golf courses.
In your experience, are they too comfortable to constitute punishment?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     Absolutely not. Certainly there have been vignettes of instances of what would
appear to be overindulgence. However people are sent to prison as punishment not for
punishment. People who are involving themselves in recreational programs, including weight
lifting frequently maintain much healthier lifestyles in prison and are less of a drain on health care
costs. More importantly we in the correctional field know that if we cannot maintain high levels of
activity to include TV in our over crowded facilities we are looking at a bleak future.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question for Secretary Chase Riveland comes from TurnkeyDM.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Mr. Riveland, would you agree that if public new the types of
behavior that your staff  has to deal with on daily basis that they would not only be appalled but
would require more restriction on inmates rights?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     I believe that for the most part the inmates in our system have daily behavior that is
appropriate and is goal oriented. Like any community we have people who are trouble makers,
who act out, who are assaultive and abusive. Like in our own communities we isolate and
penalize them. I believe if I could better portray to the general public what life in prison really is
like they would be willing to dedicate more resources to the correctional system. Unfortunately
do to the closed nature of prisons combined with the need of the media to only display the worst
of situations we are unable to fairly represent what prison life is like.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  JoanBeth has the next question for Washington's Secretary of Corrections Chase
Riveland.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Please comment on privatization of prisons.
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     Privatization from time to time has been characterized, particularly in state
legislatures as a silver bullet that will help us run things more cheaply. There are instances around
the country where that has been true and there are instances when it has been a disaster. In
looking at the issue of cost, in my opinion, it is simply playing around the fringes. The real issue
and the real point of discussion should not be who can lock people up the cheapest but rather
should be locking up so many people with the accompanying high cost at all.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Let me ask the next question of Secretary Riveland: What do you
think of Congress's so-called STOP legislation?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     I have for some time been a member of the group called STOP STOP. To much
attention originally was given by Congress, the media, and some attorney generals to the frivolous
inmate suit portion of the legislation. Most destructive in my opinion are the limitations put on
jurisdictions to fashion meaningful consent decrees, the limitations on attorney's fees, and the
other portions of the STOP legislation that limit reasonable and responsible federal court
intervention
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question for Secretary Chase Riveland comes from SlvrStorm.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Instead of low activity, how do you feel about going back to the
chain gangs?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     In my opinion we are reintroducing a strong image of slavery and
brutality. I told my legislators and governor that I wouldn't do chain gangs for 2 reasons. First, the
inmates on my work crews work to hard to slow them down with chains. Secondly, Alabama and
Arizona bought all the chain.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question for Chase Riveland comes from Iridium1.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Can you offer advice on how to convince the average person -- those
enraged with the notion that prisoners should be treated humanely -- that our system
is in desperate need of reformation, for our own benefit?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     I think many of us do a poor job, myself included in doing appropriate education.
The persons who are encouraging "tough on crime" through more incarceration and tougher
conditions use images of Willie Horton, and crying victims relatives as their symbols. Many of us
talk about hundreds of thousands of people being incarcerated and millions of dollars being spent.
Those large figures have little meaning the average person and do not draw the emotional
response of the former. We must learn better techniques for getting our citizens emotionally and
intellectually involved in this quest for solutions for crime and violence. If not we'll continue to
have only an irrational debate with irrational solutions.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Our last question for Secretary Riveland comes from LFGH.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Isn't England trying a new system.  50% serving time/25% rehab/25%
aftercare.  They said they was seeing a small decline.  Has America checked this out?
<p>
<b>RivelandC:</b>     I think there are many things we should be looking at around the
country. Some states are experimenting with restorative justice. Some are doing a better job of
providing community drug treatment. There are many successful drug courts. The key is not to
find singular solutions in my opinion. We must first determine that incarceration should be used
only for those people the community must be protected from. We then should tailor solutions or
punishments for the rest in some manner that encourages or demands that our citizens and
communities must be responsible and involved.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  Please join me in thanking Secretary Chase Riveland of the Washington State
Department of Corrections for joining our forum tonight. We plan on continuing this discussion
over the next couple of months as the country struggles to find a balance between punishment and
rehabilitation.
<p>
<b>PhilCLU:</b>  On Thursday at 7 P.M. Eastern, we'll be exploring a related topic --
the nation's drug policy -- with Eric Sterling. And, of course, please join us at any time in the
ACLU's Free Speech Zone to debate this issue or any other!

<h1>AOL Transcript 11/27/95 Eric Sterling</h1>
<h5>Copyright 1995 America Online, Inc.</h5>
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Good evening everyone. I'm Phil Gutis, the genial host of the ACLU
online series, and the ACLU's media relations director. We return tonight to one of our
favorite topics -- drug policy -- and our guest is Eric Sterling, the President of the
Criminal Justice Policy Foundation. Let me take a few moments to more fully introduce Eric
and then we'll get to your questions.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Eric has had quite  a career in the area of criminal justice.  Whoops. Looks like my
guest got bumped. Let me continue the introduction and I'm sure he'll be back. He has served as
Counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, on the staff of the Subcommittee on Crime, as a
principal aide in developing crime control bills. He's an expert witness in many trials and an
professorial lecturer at the American University.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Sorry for the delay folks. Our first question comes from SeeSalyRun.
<p><b>
Question:</b> To me, drug legalization is the most logical start to curing most of societies
problems. Opponent's arguments surprise me in their emotionalism.  What are people afraid will
happen that is worse than what is already happening?
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    Good question.  People are afraid, not without reason, that drugs
will become more widespread in their availability.  Kids will get more drugs than
the current nightmare. One other emotional aspect is that many people feel that drug use
is immoral. I don't agree.  I think that drug prohibition is immoral.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question for Eric Sterling, President of the Criminal
Justice Policy Foundation, comes from JLong6302.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Is anyone willing to say that drugs (alcohol included) do not
impact innocent people? There are victims even if it is just the family of the user.  Every
dime spent on "personal" recreation of that nature deprives both our community and the
family.  No?
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    First, most drug use does not produce victims.  Most drug use
results in no harms. Certainly however there are hundreds of thousands of cases in
which people abuse drugs --  just like alcohol, and the families are victims.  But prohibition
doesn't offer society, or the families of the victims any better protection than a
system of regulation and control.  Perhaps someone might ask what "legalization" means
before we all start jumping to conclusions and making assumptions.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking about drug prohibition with Eric Sterling. The next
question comes from Ryan72269.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Do you have any specific drugs you think would be beneficial to
legalize, and why?
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    Heroin could be made available through clinics with known potency
and clean needles -- the system would include supervision to keep track that the
social responsibilities of the heroin users are being met.  Cocaine is a hard one.  It is easier
to see coca beverages, perhaps cocaine chewing gum like those fed to
monkeys by Dr. Ron Siegel in his famous experiments.
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    Marijuana is perhaps the easiest in that it is most like alcohol
as a mass consumed drug.  Potency would be labeled.  Taxes would be set.
Advertising would be prohibited -- sorry to all my ACLU brethren.  Sales to minors
would be prohibited. As part of all of this, I would encourage -- and if I were drug
czar -- I would fight for stricter controls on alcohol and tobacco with an end to vending
machines.
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    Drugs need to be seen in a continuity.  I think promotion of
alcohol and tobacco use -- primarily targeted at the young -- is ultimately a promotion of
the experience of getting high or using drugs to fit in.  Miller Time advertisements essentially
teach us "you deserve a chemical break today"  at a tavern.  Once were trained to use chemicals
to relax, then we begin to find the chemicals we like especially.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking about drug prohibition. The next question for Eric
Sterling, President of  the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, comes from Rufus KC.
<p><b>
Question:</b> why isn't marijuana approved as a prescription drug by the
government?
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    Another good question.  Marijuana doesn't meet the FDA requirements of safety
and efficacy right now.  We don't know exactly how it works to increase appetite for
example.  We don't know how it works to control spasticity for folks with multiple
sclerosis or spinal cord injury. We don't know enough about how to properly label and set out
dosages for patients.  We don't yet have a manufacturing capability to ship
to pharmacies around the nation without getting mold or other crud on the marijuana.  BUT THE
bottom line is that there is not yet enough political DEMAND for medical marijuana.
But hold on, that's coming.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  PeterS20 has an interesting thought. What do you think Eric?
<p><b>
Question:</b> There are too many institutions that make money off drug policies,
they will never let it happen
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    The instititutions that make money are no different than other
powerful interests.  If you accept that we are a democracy and that a majority of the
people will call for rational cost effective policies notwithstanding the special pleading of
selfish interests, then the people will get what they want -- legal marijuana for
medicine, and perhaps for social, recreational and religious uses.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking with Eric Sterling, President of the Criminal Justice
Policy Foundation. Our next question comes from Codyotis.
<p><b>
Question:</b> I am a firm believer that drug legalization would help many of our
country's social problems.  However, it's crazy to waste time debating or working
toward legalization because the issue is sure political suicide for any politician or lawmaker.
Right?
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    Good point, but I disagree. Baltimore's mayor Kurt Schmoke has been re-elected
overwhelmingly after having been outspoken for drug legalization.  Indeed, he has been
re-elected TWICE.  If you are a one issue candidate, and all you are for is "legalizing" drugs,
you won't win.  But a strong candidate I think can take this position and continue to win.  But
they have to be strong.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question for Eric Sterling comes from StudyBuddy.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Do you think that, by making drugs more available..... more people
will experiment....more people will become addicted.... and we'll wind up having a bigger
drug problem than when we started?
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    Excellent question StudyBuddy.  My approach is not to make drugs more
available than they are now.  They are plenty available under prohibition because
the criminal profits are so great.  Anybody can sell drugs today, anywhere.  Under a
system of regulation you try to reduce access.  Medicalization of heroin use, for
example, will shrink the criminal market.  Those who are addicts are the overwhelming
largest portion of the market.  If they are being supplied reasonably priced -- meaning
actual production costs plus reasonable profits -- drugs, perhaps 80% of the now criminal
market will be taken away.  This will enable enforcement to substantially shrink the criminal
market.
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    You can probably guess that I recognize that you can't magically eliminate the
criminal market in a system of regulation.  You will need enforcement. So restricting availability is
part of it.  I suggest a new way of thinking about a specialized class of pharmacists -- consulting
pharmacists -- who would have a professional responsibility to you as a client to guide you in
your choice of drug taking.  If the pharmacist, in her professional opinion, felt that shooting
heroin was not appropriate because you have a serious alcohol problem, that pharmacist would be
professionally and ethically restrained from making heroin available to you.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We're talking about drug prohibition with Eric Sterling, President
of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation. Eric, by the way, has agreed to a no-holds barred
debate on this issue after our auditorium event in the ACLU's Free Speech Zone. Hope
you'll join us. The next question, though, comes from Delazure.
<p><b>
Question:</b> I do agree with the prospect of legalizing drugs, but where do you
draw the line so that the whole of society is not walking around stoned all the time?
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    Again, a good question.  Implicit in the question is that drugged reality is better
than sober reality.  is it?  Implicit in the question is that the American people (or any people) really
can't be trusted to take responsibility for themselves.  Thomas Paine discussed this question in
COMMON SENSE in the late 1770s.  The ultimate goal of  our education system is to teach self
control, not to enhance control by others.  if you don't believe that human beings are inclined
toward self-control, then we have to ask, can I trust you?  Maybe we need big brother after all. ;-)
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question for Eric Sterling comes from JJWsubvert.
<p><b>
Question:</b> The Christian Right and the Republicans have traditionally gone
after the user/abuser and not the drug itself,  How can we influence the masses to see that
the pain is much greater when drugs are illegal?
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    JJ -- tough question. Maybe we just have to dose the water supply ;-)
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    Seriously, it will take study to point out that the pain -- as you put it -- is more
crime, greater organized crime, police corruption, and the temptation of a generation of capitalist
entrepreneurs into an enterprise that lands them in prison and out of productive work FOREVER!
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  A quick plug for the Drug Reform Coordination Network....
<p><b>
Comment:</b>  People who wish can get involved in drug policy reform via the
Internet by hooking up with the Drug Reform Coordination Network, of which Eric is a member
of the advisory board.  Send e-mail to drcinfo@drcnet.org or visit http://www.drcnet.org on the
web.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  And the next question from Ronkarate.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Living in the San Francisco Mission District, I think that drugs
would actually be HARDER to find if they were legalized. I'm shocked by the amount of illegal
trade in my neighborhood, and I'm sure it is the same  inner cities.
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    Ronkarate, I suspect that you are correct about many neighborhoods.  Licensed
premises, with discreet signs could be a way to get the market and consumption out from in front
of your house, your bus stop, your Laundromat, your park and your kids school.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  A challenging comment from LS Ordway for Eric Sterling, President of
the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation.
<p><b>
Comment:</b>  What do you say to the kids of addicted parents who were short changed by their
parents weaknesses?
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    LS -- good point.  What would you say?  Are the kids of addicted
parents LESS short changed than by alcoholic parents, workaholic parents, abusive
parents?  One way that addicted parents short change their kids is that they are very
busy trying to cop -- to find drugs.  And another way is because of the cost -- addicts
are often impoverished.  But of course one could ask, what do you say to the child whose parents
are in prison for 10 years because of prohibition.
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    Parents who grow pot, or who are non-violent users of LSD, or who
now not only addicts, but swept up by informants and police officers to cram into the prisons.
What do you say to that kid?
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  An international question for Eric Sterling comes from Dead1212.
<p><b>
Question:</b> How come in the Netherlands drug laws are more relaxed & they
seem to have less of a problem?
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    The Dutch undertook a major study of drug laws in the 1970s. Their study
recommended that a program that separated soft drugs -- cannabis -- from hard drugs -- heroin
and cocaine -- was a way to keep experimenters away from the hard traffic.  The second thing the
Dutch did was to adopt a program called "harm reduction."  This says that we know junkies are
out there.  Can we make their lives less miserable?  Can we keep them free from disease like
hepatitis or HIV?  So the Dutch started distributing clean needles to addicts from many points
around their cities.  When the junkies came to get or exchange used needles, they were regularly
exposed to counselors who offered them help -- psychological help -- help getting treatment, help
getting clean.  The addicts were not treated as disgusting scum that had to be squished like
roaches, but as brothers and sisters who had problems who need help.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  We have time for a couple more questions. But this topic, as usual,
stirs up quite a buzz. I'm backlogged by more than a hundred questions. Remember, Eric has
agreed to come over to the ACLU's Free Speech Zone (if he can get in...) after this
evening's event.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Our next question comes from Moose7Jack.
<p><b>
Question:</b> Are there any figures available about deregulation in terms of
cost-effectiveness that you can share with us?
<p><b>
SterlingEE:</b>    Moose -- excellent question.  Keeping a person in prison for a
year costs the Feds $20,000 per year.  Treatment can be had for several thousand $ per year.
I think we could raise about $6 billion in marijuana taxes each year in a legal
system instead of spending $5 to 10 billion on marijuana enforcement.  We are now
spending -- Federal, State and local -- $30 billion on drug enforcement.  Well, the
government says lets take the profits out through the forfeiture of drug dealers
profits.  They get less than $1 billion per year.  On a $50 billion a year criminal
business, that is a tax rate of 2%.  Less than sales tax, it ain't much of a bite!  This is an
area in which much more research is needed to see what a policed and regulated
market in drugs would look like.  Good Question.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Well, folks, I'm afraid that's all the time we have for tonight.
Come on over to the ACLU's free speech zone to talk with Eric himself! Make sure to
leave room for him to get in though.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>  Goodnight folks!

<h1>AOL Transcript 9/26/95 Laura Murphy</h1>
<h5>Copyright 1995 America Online, Inc.</h5>
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Evening everyone. Welcome to the joint online appearance by the ACLU
and the NRA to discuss our 24-point plan to address federal law enforcement that
will be announced tomorrow at a Washington news conference.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Joining us tonight on the Stage are Tanya K. Metaksa, the Executive
Director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action. And Laura W. Murphy, the Director of the ACLU's National Washington office.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Let's open it up with opening statements, if we may. Laura. Anything
to start with?
<p><b>
LWMURPHY:</b>	 I am overjoyed at the prospect of widening the coalition in favor
of greater accountability in federal law enforcement efforts.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Tanya, anything to start off with?
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	The problems we are focusing upon today are not the problems of
individual law enforcement agents, but problems of policy and leadership.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Okay, we're talking with Tanya Metaksa of the NRA and Laura Murphy
of the ACLU. The first question comes from CBurgL.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Is it the ACLU's position that civil rights violations occured at
Ruby Ridge?
<p><b>
LWMURPHY:</b>	We have not independently analyzed the events at Ruby Ridge, but we believe that there was lack of sufficient supervision, and a tendancy to make up rules
<p><b>
LWMURPHY:</b>	in mid-course, during the stand-off, which lead to tragic consequences.
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	The Department of Justice's report indicated that civil rights
violations occurred. For the first time in our history, you've seen five federal law
enforcement agents take the Fifth in testimony before Congress.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking about Federal Law Enforcement with Tanya Metaksa of
the NRA and Laura Murphy of the ACLU. The next question comes from DWhite1974
and is addressed to the NRA.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Tanya, a lot of us civil libertarians are wary of the NRA because
it seems to ignore nine of the ten Amendments that make up the Bill of Rights. Where is the
NRA's committment to due process, fair trial, etc?
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	We support the entire Bill of Rights, from the First through the
Tenth amendments, but we focus on the Second. That doesn't mean that due process, fair
trial, and the Fourth Amendment are not important. Just because we support strong
punishment for people convicted of violent crimes doesn't mean we would have criminals
punished in violation of any part of the Constitution.
<p><b>
LWMURPHY:</b>	The ACLU and the NRA have very different agendas , but we agree on
several important issues having to do with greater accountability for federal law
enforcement procedures. I think that our organizations both agree that no new powers should
be given to federal law enfocement agencies (of which there are over 100) until we can
be sure that procedures are in place that safeguard the constitutional rights of all.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking about federal law enforcement and other issues with
the NRA and the ACLU. The next question comes from XPhileAmy.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Would banning guns disrupt the balance of powers that our nation is
famous for?
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Tanya?
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	"Banning guns" is not the issue we are here to discuss.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Laura, anything to add?
<p><b>
LWMURPHY:</b>	The balance of powers that our government is known for has little
or nothing to do with banning guns, but more to do with the seperation of powers and the checks and balances that they give to the legislative, executive and judicial branches.
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	We are concerned about powers granted to federal law enforcement
agencies that are being misused.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking about federal law enforcement with Tanya Metaksa of
the NRA and Laura rphy of the ACLU. The next question comes from RonaldCor and is
addressed to Laura.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	LWM:  What does ACLU mean by "acountability in law enforcement"?
<p><b>
LWMURPHY:</b>	What we mean is that law enforcement operates by commonly
understood rules that comport with the bill of rights and Constitution. For example, we would not expect a federal law enforcement official to enter someone's home without securing a valid warrant, because to do otherwise would violate the Fourth Amendment.  this may seem like a simple proposition, when in fact, we have uncovered numerous allegations of warrantless searches on the part of federal officials.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>Tanya, anything to add? What is the NRA's definition?
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	We believe that federal agents must be held to the same standards
as all other law enforcement officers and other citizens.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Tanya Metaksa of the NRA and Laura Murphy of the
ACLU. The next question comes from Zarrdoz.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	This is for either participant: Do you see the ACLU and the NRA
working together on any other projects in the future?
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Tanya? You first?
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	This project has been on-going since Jan. 1993, and since that time
Pres. Clinton has not responded to our calls for a commission to study the abuses by
federal law enforcement agencies. Until this project is completed, NRA will continue to pursue this agenda. However, we will always try to work with the ACLU in civil rights matters.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Laura?
<p><b>
LWMURPHY:</b>	I would hope that the ACLU and the NRA would not only continue to
work on the commission but would also work to assure that Congress does not enact poorly
crafted crime and counter-terrorism proposals that expand federal investigatory
powers with no safe guards.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	The next question for Laura Murphy of the ACLU and Tanya Metaksa of
the NRA comes from KYBillG.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Why is Clinton so ready to go for the increased powers.  Is he
getting bad advice.  Has he ever been a civil libertarian?
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Laura?
<p><b>
LWMURPHY:</b>	HE WAS A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR AT ONE POINT IN HIS
CAREER!!!!! But I think he feels that it is politically safer to sound tough on crime and hope that his friends in Congress and constituents don't read the fine print.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Tanya? Why do you think the President keeps pushing for expanded
powers?
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	It appears that Pres. Clinton wants to appease those in the Dept.
of Justice who are interested in trying to continue the war on drugs, which is taking
increasing amounts of money and other resources to win. They have all forgotten in their
zeal, that it s more important to safeguard the rights of citizens than to catch the drug-runners.
<p><b>
LWMURPHY:</b>	Way to go Tanya!
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Laura Murphy of the ACLU and Tanya Metaksa of the
NRA. The next question comes from BuyingTim.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	While rushing to reform FBI rules of engagement (which should be),
I believe there is an even more sinister aspect to address:  Law enforcement's increasing
pressure on citizens to become enformants.  That, after all, was the real prime mover, in
Ruby Ridge, for instance. Comments from either Laura or Tayna please?
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Tanya?
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	I believe that BATF's attempt to turn Randy Weaver into an informer
was the catalyst for the whole sad episode. The idea of entrapping honest citizens into
informing is obscene.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Laura?
<p><b>
LWMURPHY:</b>	Informants are notoriously unreliable.  It is not a sound way to
investigate illegal activity because the informant has a motivation to deliver
"something" in order to get paid.
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	IT is important to remember that a federal judge accused BATF of
entrapping Weaver
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Our next question for Tanya Metaksa of the NRA and Laura Murphy of
the ACLU comes from Edie88.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Why are Civil Lib. under such attack from both right and left at
this time?
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Laura?
<p><b>
LWMURPHY:</b>	Because of the end of the cold war, and increasing political
isolationist policies in the international arena, Americans are being pitted against one
another.  We must avoid the temptations to scapegoat vulnerable groups within our own
borders--an idea fueled by elected officials who are looking to divide and conquer.  If you
villify enough groups frequently, then you create a climate where people feel justified
in denying the targeted groups rights whether we are talking about members of militias or
immigrants.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Tanya, any thoughts?
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	 People reach for a safety net when they feel threatened by crime
and criminals. They then prefer the safety of Big Brother telling them what to do
rather than the freedom of self determination.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Our next question comes from Motorman6.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Do either of you think that the American public might be somewhat
paranoid about the powers of the Federal Government?
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Tanya?
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	No. They are not frightened enough of the possibility of some
agency of government into their homes without a warrant, to investigate non-existent
criminal behavior.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Laura?
<p><b>
LWMURPHY:</b>	I believe that the American people are ambivilent.  One one hand
they support simple sounding solutions like more police.  On the other hand I think there is
general concern about things like IRS employees snooping into tax records and illegally
distributing that information to businesses as was the case in the Atlanta IRS field office.  As
long as more powers help in the short run, few think of the long term consequences of
expanded powers being mishandled.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We have time for one more question. It comes from LucyGee and is for
the NRA.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Why doesn't the NRA just come out and say that the 2nd Amend is for
protection against oppressive government?  It has nothing to do with hunting.
<p><b>
Tmetaksa:</b>	We are on record more times than I count, pointing out that the
purpose of the amendment is to guarantee the American people their right to possess the
means with which they can protect life and liberty, that it is not about hunting or any other
sport, such as target shooting.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	I want to thank Tanya Metaksa of the NRA and Laura Murphy of the
ACLU for joining us tonight. Check back in Constitution Hall tomorrow for the
24-point joint plan we'll be releasing tomorrow to the media at a news conference in DC.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Thanks again. And goodnight.

					ACLU Urges Carnegie Mellon To Reverse Internet Censorship; Letter to University President Says Students Must Have Access to Information

				FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
				<br>
				November 8, 1994 
			</b>
			<p>
			In a strongly worded letter to the President of Carnegie Mellon University, the American Civil Liberties Union today urged the university to reconsider and reverse its decision to prohibit student access to six network news groups that deal with sexual topics on the Internet. 
			<p>
			"Carnegie Mellon has a well deserved reputation in higher education as a leader on technology issues," said Barry Steinhardt, Associate Director of the ACLU. "You have already recognized the extraordinary potential of networked communications to enhance and democratize speech. 
			<P>
			"But if the full potential is to be reached, it is important that leaders like Carnegie Mellon stand strong for free and open access to information and that you resist the urge to censor," Steinhardt concluded. 
			<P>
			In its letter, the ACLU said that Carnegie Mellon officials based their decision to remove the news groups on a broad misreading of Pennsylvania obscenity law. The vast majority of information on these news groups has never been challenged as obscene, the ACLU said, nor could the university be held liable for distributing this material through the Internet. 
			<P>
			"Your policy sweeps far too broadly," the letter said. "Out of fear that your students may be exposed to a few unprotected works, you have cut off access to a large volume of protected ideas and information."

			Dr. Robert Mehrabian 
			<br>
			President 
			<br>
			Carnegie Mellon University 
			<br>
			5000 Forbes Ave. Warner Hall 
			<br>
			Pittsburgh, Pa 15213 
			<br>
			<p>
			Dear President Mehrabian: 
			<p>
			We write on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to urge Carnegie Mellon University to reconsider and reverse the decision to prohibit student access to six network news groups which deal with sexual topics. We believe that the University's plan is inconsistent with the principles of academic freedom and free speech, which a great University must defend, and is based on a serious misreading of relevant laws. 
			<p>
			Carnegie Mellon's decision to offer its students broad access to the Internet and its thousands of news groups was a farsighted recognition that networked communications will increasingly provide the means for academic research and the forum for the free exchange of ideas. Like your decision to establish and nurture a library, it was a decision to give your students access to the widest variety of information and to allow them to make their own judgements about their worth. 
			<p>
			Your decision to revoke access to the six news groups deprives your students of the opportunity to judge for themselves the value of these groups. 
			<p>
			As we understand the rationale for your decision, the University is concerned about its potential liability under Pennsylvania's obscenity law and particularly its provisions relating to minors. We believe that the conclusions you have drawn are mistaken and misperceive your role in providing student access to the Internet. This also seems surprising since there has apparently been no effort by any governmental entity to assert the existence of any such liability. 
			<P>
			To begin with, these news groups are not "obscene" merely because they contain sexually explicit materials. Most sexually explicit speech is protected by the First Amendment and only a small portion of sexually explicit materials can constitutionally be deemed obscene. A jury applying the three-part test of Miller v. California must decide on a case by case basis whether a particular work is obscene. There are literally thousands of postings to these news groups every year and only a small fraction have ever been challenged as obscene. 
			<P>
			Your policy sweeps far too broadly. Out of fear that your students may be exposed to a few works that a court might ultimately find unprotected, you have cut off access to a large volume of protected ideas and information. 
			<P>
			In fact, you have cut off access to information that is clearly of significant value to your students and deals with 0serious societal issues. For example, in barring access to the alt.sex news group, you have deprived students of access to all of its branches, including alt.sex. safe sex, which discusses responsible sexual behavior. 
			<P>
			The University's conclusion that you must cut off access to these news groups because " it is a criminal offense to knowingly disseminate sexually explicit material to minors..." is equally troubling. 
			<P>
			First, it is not illegal to distribute any "sexually explicit" material to minors. The state can only ban the distribution to minors of materials that satisfies the classic three part Miller test, as modified for minors. A careful reading of Pennsylvania law makes this clear. 18 Pa. C.S.A. 5903 applies only to those types of sexually explicit materials which satisfy the modified test and are "harmful to minors". 
			<P>
			Secondly, even assuming that some of the material posted to these news groups might properly be restricted to adults, it is a well established principle that obscenity policies cannot reduce adults to reading only that which is fit for children. But that is precisely the effect of the new policy. 
			<P>
			The vast majority of your students are undoubtedly over the age of 18 and legally adults. The policy effectively treats them as children and limits their access to materials deemed suitable for children. 
			<P>
			That is not what the law requires and we do not think that you would draw this conclusion in other contexts. Surely, you don't believe that Pennsylvania law requires that the University library and bookstore, or for that matter your literature classes, must be purged of all sexually explicit material because there may be minors on campus or minors may access the imagery. 
			<P>
			Finally, by its terms, the Pennsylvania obscenity law cannot be applied to the University's provision of Internet access; nor should it be. The Pennsylvania statute provides that a party can only be held liable for the content of material"... which is reasonably susceptible of examination by the defendant". (Sec 5903 (b)) 
			<P>
			By its very nature, the Internet is vast and chaotic. There are millions of speakers and countless speeches. The Internet is so large and disorderly that the University could never reasonably be expected to examine the content of every message available to your students. 
			<P>
			Nor could you reasonably be expected to be able to control all access to any particular group of messages. One of the unique features of the Internet is that there are many paths to the same destination. 
			<P>
			CMU's students are smart and technologically savvy. They will quickly learn how to use the access provided by the University to subscribe to Internet "mailing lists", to download archival files or to link with other networks to obtain exactly the same material that is available in the banned news groups. 
			<P>
			The new policy assumes that the University has an obligation to prevent its students from obtaining access to any possibly illegal materials about which the University has knowledge. If that assumption is correct, then you have not gone far enough in simply blocking access to a few news groups. To meet such a heavy burden you would need to take the draconian steps of either monitoring all student communications or cutting off all access to the Internet. 
			<P>
			Fortunately, the law does not impose that burden. The law properly holds speakers and publishers liable for the content of their messages. By offering your students access to thousands of news groups and hundreds of millions of postings, you are neither a speaker, nor a publisher. At most, you are acting as a distributor providing access to information, exactly in the same way that you provide access to library books, and could not and should not be held liable, for example, if a 17 year-old freshman happens to check out a book with "sexually explicit" content. 
			<P>
			In fact, Subsection (j) of the Pennsylvania obscenity law explicitly exempts "any library of any school, college or university..." from its reach. The Legislature recognized that universities and libraries have special protections as access providers to knowledge and that you should not be chilled in your mission by the specter of criminal or civil prosecution of an obscenity law that you cannot be reasonably expected to enforce. 
			<P>
			While your connection to the Internet may not be housed in your library building, it is no less deserving of the protection offered by Subsection (j). By providing wide access to the Internet, you are, in effect, functioning as electronic librarians and the exemption should apply. Furthermore, as a well established principle of constitutional due process, any doubts about applicability of Pennsylvania obscenity laws must be resolved in your favor. 
			<P>
			Indeed, we would think and hope that the University would want to lay vigorous claim to this exemption in order to protect future concepts of academic freedom. A library free from government control is an essential component of a vibrant university. As technology changes the ways in which we store and access information, it seems beyond dispute that the digital library of the next century will bear far greater resemblance to the Internet than to today's brick and mortar constructs. As the technology changes, it is essential that we not lose sight of core principles of academic freedom. 
			<P>
			Carnegie Mellon has a well-deserved reputation in higher education as a leader on technology issues. You have already recognized the extraordinary potential of networked communications to enhance and democratize speech. But if the full potential is to be reached, it is important that leaders like CMU stand strong for free and open access to information and that you resist the urge to censor. 
			<P>
			We strongly urge you to reconsider the new policy. It is our understanding that the University's decision was made without consultation with your counsel. We hope that you will now take that step. We would be happy to provide your attorneys with additional citations and materials to facilitate a reconsideration. 
			<P>
			Thank you for your consideration of our views.

<h1>AOL Transcript 10/31/95 Marc Mauer</h1>

<h5>Copyright 1995 America Online, Inc.</h5>
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Good evening everyone. I'm Phil Gutis, the ACLU's media director and
our ever welcoming host of our AOL forum. Tonight I'm delighted to welcome to our
CenterStage Marc Mauer for a discussion about our nation's criminal justice
system. 
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Let me take a few moments to introduce our Halloween guest and then
we'll get started with your questions. Remember, to ask questions, use the
Interact icon at the top of your screen.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Marc Mauer is the Assistant Director of The Sentencing Project. He
has directed programs on criminal justice reform for twenty years. He is the
author of some of the most widely cited reports in the field of criminal justice,
including Young Black Men and the Criminal Justice System and the Americans Behind Bars
series.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Marc has served as a consultant to the Bureau of Justice Assistance
and the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Please join me in welcoming Marc to AOL. And Marc, let me ask the
first question: It seems that every day we are hearing more and more about the idea
that our criminal justice system is indeed racist. Do you believe it to be so?
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	I think that there is often a debate about whether criminal justice
policies are consciencely racist. I am more concerned with the outcomes of policies rather
than their intent. For example, I don't know what is in the minds of the members of
Congress when they passed crack cocaine laws in 1986 and 1988 but what we do
know now is that those laws have clearly had a racist effect. And therefore by not acting to change those laws at this point that clearly seems to me to be a racist action.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Marc Mauer of The Sentencing Project, which has
become one national leaders in the search for reform of our national criminal
justice policy. Let me ask a followup. Were you suprised to see President Clinton's
speedy signature on the Congressional crack bill?
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	Historically after the Sentencing Commission made its
recommendations, the Justice Department made clear its opposition to those
recommendations. Once that decision was made it would have been very difficult politically for President Clinton to support the Sentencing Commission.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking tonight with Marc Mauer, a twenty-year expert on
criminal justice. Our next question comes from RAArehart.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	you are using the word "racist" in different ways - are you
implying that a statistical imbalance implies racism?
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	No. I think a statistical imbalance is racist though if it fails to
achieve a policy objective that could be accomplished through other means that would not
aggravate those racial disparities. In the crack cocaine case for example, there has been very little impact on drug abuse that can be credited to the policy. But the harm that has been caused is substantial.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Marc Mauer of The Sentencing Project. Our next
question comes from Plang0012 who would like to know, and I'll paraphrase here for
reasons of technical ease, whether you feel the system makes it "easier to put a black man
away."
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	I think what we see in the criminal justice system a combination of
race and class effect that is blacks are not necessarily always more likely to be sentenced
to prison for being black but just as much for being disproportionately low-income. The OJ Simpson Trial is obviously the best example of this where the wealth of a black defendent was much more significant than his race.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Marc Mauer, a longtime analyst of our nation's
criminal justice policy. The next question comes from Ken a h.
<p><b>
Comment:</b>	how do you explain 60-70% of all prisoners - are Black - you suggest
the entire US sends Blacks to prison for the hell of it.... No, they commit 60-70% of
the crime, and they are only 15% of the population, that is the racism here.
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	Blacks do not commit  60 to 70 percent of crime although they do
commit a disproportionate share of some crimes. For example, blacks represent about forty-five percent of all arrests for violent crime. Studies have shown that for violent crimes blacks are incarcerated at roughly the same proportion of which they commmit crimes. But for drug offenses in particular blacks are incarcerated in greater numbers than they use drugs or are arrested for drug offfenses.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Marc Mauer of the Sentencing Project. The next
question comes from Aerospace.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Isn't it true that the law abiding citizens who live in the inner
cities and have to tolerate drug dealers want tougher laws and penalties to protect
their families/children?
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	People in all communities whether rich or poor want safe communities.
The communities that are the safest have not become that way because they have the
toughest laws or the most police. Instead they are safe because  they have strong
families and communities and many resources to draw upon. I think that in low income communities we should supply not only appropriate law enforcement but also try to bring additional resources such as prevention, treatment and economic development into those communities as well.
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	That is what I hear people in low income communities asking for to help solve their problems.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Our next question for Marc Mauer comes from EAnder135.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	In a presumedly color-blind system, does the presence of racists
condemn the entire system?
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	I don't know anyone in the year 1995 who still thinks we have a
color-blind system this doesn't mean that every institution is completely racist but
that racism is still prevelent in our society in general.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Our next question for Marc Mauer comes from JLong6302.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	You can make anything in the world a race issue.  How about just
making it a responsibility issue?
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	All of us, regardless of our circumstances, are responsible for our
actions but we don't all begin life with the same amount of resources or support. Therefore, it's easier for some of us to act in a way that is viewed as responsible than for others. Understanding this doesn't condone criminal behavior but it allows us to try to understand where that behavior comes from and how we as a society should respond to it.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Marc Mauer of The Sentencing Project. The next
question comes from MumB
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Would you disagree that crack causes more violence than powder
cocaine, fries the brain much quicker, is addictive virtually the first time you use it and
causes such inexcusable harm to children that that is perhaps why the penalties for it are
stiffer.
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	Most of the research on crack cocaine shows us that the violence
associated with the drug is primarily due to the drug trade itself. That is, the violence
that occurs between rival drug dealers who are heavily armed and fighting battles over
drug distribution territories. There are already sufficient laws in place to punish drug dealers who
engage in violence. We don't need harsh mandatory minimum sentences for the people at the
bottom of the drug trade who are using drugs or selling drugs to support their own
drug addiction.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Marc, let me ask the next question: Your recent report on the number
of young black men under the jurisdiction of the criminal justice system created quite
a stir. What is that you are trying to say with the report?
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	I think it is important to call attention to the dramatic numbers of young black men in the system. I think it is particularly important for two reasons: First, because the policies that have created these numbers have not succeeded in having a significant impact on crime. Second, the long-term consequences of these policies for the black community and particularly the next generation of black children will be devastating
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Our next question for Marc Mauer comes from Boo Ahhhh.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Hi...how do you feel about the new codes passed in Pasadena that
deal with gang members and how police are going to be able to deal with them?
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	I am not familiar with that code.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Our next question for Marc Mauer comes from PtsBeyond.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Maybe this was covered--but were all the other recommendations put
into effect tomorrow, i.e. the marijuana growing sentencing changes from 1000 to 100
grams.  And so the mandantory minimums still apply?
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	I don't understand the question.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Okay, I'm afraid I don't understand it enough to explain it either,
so let's move on. The next question comes from NAC5.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Why not advocate stiffer penalties for powder cocaine also?
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	Because the penalties for powder cocaine are already stiff enough. There is also very little research that shows us that merely increasing the harshness of penalties has any significant impact on criminal behavior.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Let me ask the last question, Marc. Are you optimistic for the
future? Your most recent report suggested a very bleak outlook.
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	In general I am not optimistic in the short run. But I have been very encouraged about the increased level of discussion of issues of race and the criminal justice system in recent months. I hope that we can take the anger that has been generated due to the
Congressional votes on crack and other recent events to work towards some
constructive changes in the months ahead.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Actually, Marc, I just remembered one more question that I wanted to
explore with you: Both Houses of Congress have passed the STOP bill. Do you see this
leading to more Atticas?
<p><b>
MauerM:</b>	It certainly won't help. While I can't predict the whole impact of this legislation
it is a sad commentary on the state of civil liberties and our sense of compassion these days.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	I'm afraid that we've run out of time. Please join me in thanking
Marc Mauer for tonight's discussion. I'm sure this is an issue we'll be exploring
repeatedly over the coming months. And remember, please join us in the ACLU's Free
Speech Zone anytime night or day to talk about the criminal justice system or
any other topic that suits your fancy.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Good night everyone.
