<h1>AOL Transcript 10/25/95 Ethan Nadelmann</h1>
<h5>Copyright 1995 America Online, Inc.</h5>
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Good evening everyone. Thanks for joining us tonight for what I'm
sure will be a fascinating conversation about our nation's drug policy.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	I'm Phil Gutis, the ACLU's media director and host of Constitution
Hall, our forum on AOL. I'm delighted to welcome Ethan Nadelmann to our stage tonight.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Let me take a few moments to introduce Ethan and then we'll get
started with your questions. Remember, you can ask questions by using the interact
icon at the top of your screen.
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	Hello everyone.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Ethan Nadelmann, Director of the Lindesmith Center, is an
accomplished scholar of drug control policy and the international aspects of crime and
law enforcement. Over the past seven years, Nadelmann's critiques of United States
drug control policy and his recommendations for alternatives to drug prohibition have
attracted national and international attention and played a significant role
in stimulating the growing debate over drug policy in the U.S. and abroad.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Please join me in welcoming Ethan to the AOL CenterStage.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Ethan, let me open with the first question: What is your outlook
these days? Is there hope that our ill-fated policies will eventually be changed?
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	On the one hand it looks bleak, because what the radical right is advocating. It's sad to see President Clinton, and many of the Democrats jumping on the bandwagon, that allows them to skirt the bigger issues. But, when you look at drug reform policy today, to 7 years ago
you see progress.
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	First, there were barely 2 or 3 needle exchange programs in the US and now there are dozens in the US. The scientific establishment has help provide that. Medical marijuana is moving forward with a major ballot intiative in California. Drug policy reform initiatives, and public opinion polls have changed to acceptance toward more treatment and prevention. All and all there is progress, with more to come. 
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Ethan Nadelmann, who was formerly on the faculty
of Princeton University, where he was the founding chair of the Princeton Working
Group on the Future of Drug Use and Alternatives to Drug Prohibition. The
next question comes from Kimba III
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Ethan....what would be the possitive affects of legalizing drugs?
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	You would see, depending on how much and how far you leagalize,
dramatic reductions in the crime, corruption and violence associated with prohibition.
One could also expect reductions in accidental poisionins for impure
and adulterated drugs. Reductions in drug related HIV and Aids, and far nore senseable
drug treatment policies. Also, one would no longer be spending 10's of millions of dollars
supporting our drug establishment. We could see billions dollars in tax revenues,
from the sale of drugs such as marjiuana, that are now illegal.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with drug policy expert Ethan Nadelmann. The next
question comes from SeeSalyRun.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Why do we even attempt to control something that people are always
going to get one way or the other.  Why not take the sin tax money and use it for something
useful, like education?
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	Well it's important to distiguish between regulation and control,
on the one hand, and prohibition, i.e., lack of control, on the other. There are lots of things people want, that may not be especially good for them, and it makes sense for the gov. to invest some energies and resources into discouraging use and forms of regulation. But prohibition is not the correct approach in most cases. It made discourage some, or engaging in other vices, but it is not particularly effective and it can prove highly costly and counter-productive.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with drug policy expert Ethan Nadelmann. The next
question is from Nikiz4m.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Are you particular about which drugs you wish to legalize?
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	I am particular when it comes to the issues of production, manufacture, and distribution. I think we need to heed the lessons and experiences of the aftermath of alcohol prohibition, when this country experimented with a wide variety of alcohol measures, some states legalized beer, but not hard liquor, others legalized everything, some for sale in liquor stores, others only in licensed outlets, and other in grocery stores. Some had high taxes, others low. We need the same sort of local experimentation in the US with the drugs that are now illicit. But, I do believe that it should be legal for adults to posses any drug in small amounts for personal consumption, so long as they do not directly endanger others, such as driving under the influence.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking tonight about the nation's drug policies with Ethan
Nadelmann. The next question comes from Lark39.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	How can you call our policies ill fated?  Illict drugs are killing
hundreds every year. Why would you want to legalize something like that?
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	I believe that the legalization of the possesion of drugs by adults is justified, not only on public policy grounds, but also on moral, ethical grounds. I do believe that our right of personal autonomy should include the right to alter one's state of consciousness so long as one does no harm to others. I also believe that underlying the First Amendment rights of freedom, of speech, press, religion and assembly, is a more fundemental right over one's consciousness that inevitably includes the right for one to alter one's consciousness with drugs.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with drug policy expert Ethan Nadelmann. The next
question is from Gonzo6969
<p><b>
Question:</b>	think it would be interesting to actually get some REAL numbers of
casual drug users (eg. marijuana  peyote and psyillocybin)   Any numbers from your side of
the research?
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	An estimated 70 million Americans have smoked marijuana at least
once in their life, thats probably a majority of American citizens between the ages
of 16 and 45. Close to 25 million Americans have used cocaine, and close to 20
million, I believe have tried one hallucinogen or another. It's important to note,
that the majority of Americans have not had a problem with these drugs.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with Ethan Nadelmann, an expert on drug policy. The
next question comes from Vazco.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	the entire drug testing industry seems to be growing and getting
more efficient, does that not contradict the fact that legalization is getting nearer?
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	One could have a drug prohibition system with no drug testing, as
is the case in many foreign countries, and one could also have legalization with
pervasive drug testing. Indeed, it is possible that a drug control policy that replaces
prohibitionist methods with universal drug testing, backed by stiff civil commitment
penalties, would be even more insidious and venal than our current drug policies.
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	It is important to realize that the supposed benefits of drug
testing in the workplace have been vastly overstated. Indeed many studies now show few if
any benefits to employers from drug testing. I strongly recomend that people
examine the recent report of the National Academy of Science on this subject.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking about national drug policy with Ethan Nadelmann. The
next question comes DWhite1974.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Ethan, I was pleasantly surprised  to hear that a recent Center
Stage guest -- from the National Rifle Association, of all organizations -- believed that
the war on drugs is doing more harm than good.  Is this further reason for optimism?
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	I was not aware that the NRA had adopted such a position. I have
met people who believe that the right to use drugs and the right to posses firearms are
part, and parcel of the same basic idealogy of freedom. I also know opponents of gun
control who are strong advocates of the drug war, and who believe that the government 
should focus it's criminal justice resources on prosecuting drug users rather than
illecit gun possesers.
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	My own view is that we need senseable regulation in both domains
that attain a reasonable compromise between public health, public safety, and
personal autonomy.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with national drug policy expert Ethan Nadelmann. Our
next question comes from Rmwaterm.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	I understand the potential economic benefits of drug legalization
vis a vis tax revenue and less police enforcement; however, there are serious economic
and social detriments, namely low worker productivity, increased health costs, fetal addiction,
etc.
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	That assumes that legalization would result in substaintial
increases in drug abuse. It seems to me that assumption is faulty. Drug legalization would
probably lead to more American using a broader array of drugs with fewer negative
consequences than is currently the case under drug prohibition.
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	A legal drug regulation regime would provide for drugs of known
purity, potency, and quality. There would be fewer overdoses from adulterated drugs and illegal
drugs of unexpectedly high potency. Remember also that drug prohibition favors drugs
that are more easily smuggled and hidden, i.e. drugs that are more potent and
lucurative. Al Capone didn't want to smuggle beer, which was 6% proof, he wanted to smuggle whiskey which was 80% proof. Simarluarly, the Columbiam trafficers don't
want to smuggle opium which are smelly and harder to transport. They would rather smuggle cocaine and heroine. Simply stated, drug prohibition tends to favor more dangerous drugs. Legal drug regulation tends to favor more benign drugs. 
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b> 	Finally keep in mind that the vast majority of Americans have
indicated, in public opinion polls and personal behavors that they do not need a drug
prohibition system to keep them form becoming drug addicts.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	We're talking with drug policy expert Ethan Nadelmann. Our next
question comes from TimArlen.
<p><b>
Question:</b>	Wouldn't people rather get high than be productive citizens??  It
would be entirely too easy for the entire society to become dependent on escapism.
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	Thats a fairly bleek view of human nature, which I do not share. Most Americans, like most human beings seem to posses innate desires to both be productive and to enjoy themselves. Indeed, people commonly use drugs for both purposes. Stimulants
such as caffeine, nicotene, and cocaine are offten used to enhance productivity. Used properly, they do in fact enhance productivity. Conversely, alcohol and tranquilizers are used to relax.
Only a small minority of people are prone to abuse themselves with any of these drugs,and that small minoirity is likely to remain roughly the same size whether we legalize or continue to prohibit.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Unfortunately, we are out of time. Please join me in thanking Ethan
Nadelmann, Director of the Lindesmith Cener, a project of the Open Society Institute,
for joining us this evening. I promise we'll explore this topic again soon, but in the
meantime feel free to join us at any time in the Free Speech Zone to discuss this
or any other civil liberties questions. And tomorrow night, we tackle, once again, the question of what the Bible really says about homosexuality.
<p><b>
ENadelmann:</b>	If people desire further info, they can contact me at ENADELMANN@SOROSNY.ORG or contact the drug policy foundation at info@dpf.org.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	And, of course, a full transcript of this event will be available by
tomorrow evening.
<p><b>
PhilCLU:</b>	Thanks, everyone. And goodnight.
<p>

BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION</U> <P>
</CENTER></B>     Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to prevent the
enforcement of Act No. 1029, Ga. Laws 1996, p. 1505, codified at
O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1 ("the Act"), a recently enacted Georgia
statute that unconstitutionally restricts free expression over the
Internet and other computer networks.  Specifically, the Act
unconstitutionally prohibits plaintiffs and others from using
pseudonyms or communicating anonymously over computer networks. 
The Act also unconstitutionally restricts the "use" by plaintiffs
and others of trade names, logos and certain other graphics over
computer networks.  Plaintiffs are individuals and organizations,
and their members, users, and subscribers, who communicate over
computer networks and who are fearful that the Act has made their
protected expression a crime. <P>
     The Act's enforcement should be enjoined for the following
reasons: <P>
     (1)     The Act violates the plaintiffs' federal and state
constitutional rights to free expression, association, and
privacy; <P>
     (2)     The Act is substantially overbroad; <P>
     (3)     The Act is unconstitutionally vague; and <P>
     (4)     The Act violates the Commerce Clause of the United
States Constitution because it regulates commerce occurring wholly
outside the borders of the State of Georgia. <P>
<CENTER><B><U>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</U></B> <P>
</CENTER><B>RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE ACT</B> <P>
     The Act imposes two content-based restrictions upon
expression over computer networks, including the world-wide
network known as the Internet.  First, it prohibits communications
over computer networks using a name that "<B>falsely identifies</B>"
the speaker.  Specifically, the Act makes it a crime for: <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>any person . . . knowingly <B>to transmit any data
through a computer network</B> . . . for the purpose of
setting up, maintaining, operating, or exchanging data
with an electronic mailbox, home page, or any other
electronic information storage bank or point of access
to electronic information <B>if such data uses any
individual name</B> . . . <B>to falsely identify the
person . . . .</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>
Second, the Act makes it a crime to publish information over
computer networks if the information "<B>uses" trade names, logos,
and other symbols</B> in certain ways.  Specifically, the Act makes
it a crime for: <P>
<DL>
<DD>any person . . . knowingly to transmit any data through a
computer network<B><I> </I></B>[for the purposes set forth above]<I> </I>if such
data <B>uses any . . . trade name</B>,<B> registered trademark,
logo, legal or official seal, or copyrighted symbol<I>
</B>. . . <B></I>which would falsely state or imply that such
person</B> . . . <B>has permission or is legally authorized
to use [it]</B> for such purpose<I> </I><B>when such permission or
authorization has not been obtained</B><I>. <P>
</DL>
</I>O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1(a) (1996) (emphasis supplied).   <P>
<B>TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS AFFECTED BY THE ACT</B> <P>
     To understand the breadth of communications the Act censors,
it is necessary to appreciate the unique nature of the online
medium. The definition of "computer networks" in the Act
encompasses any set of remotely connected computers over which
communications can take place, including the Internet, commercial
online services such as America Online, and local and national
computer bulletin board systems.  <U>See</U> O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-92(2).  The
venue provisions of the statute provide that it applies to any
communications that pass at any time through the wires or airspace
of Georgia.  <U>See</U> O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-94(4).  Because of the nature of
the online medium, the restrictions upon expression imposed by the
Act therefore apply to a wide variety of communications over
thousands of different local, national and international computer
networks, within and outside Georgia. <P>
<B><U>Types of Computer Networks</B> <B>Affected</B></U> <P>
     Specifically, the Act affects communications over at least
the following three types of computer networks: <P>
<B>     The Internet</B> -- The Internet is the largest computer network
in the world, linking together tens of thousands of smaller
computer networks established by individuals, universities,
governments, organizations, and businesses.  Approximately 20-40
million users communicate and publish or receive information over
this network.  These include hundreds of thousands of users in
Georgia, all of whom can communicate with or receive information
from any other user on the network anywhere else in the world.
Declaration of Shari Steele (Ex. A) ["Steele Aff."] &#182;&#182; 14-18. 
Much, if not most, of the communication over the Internet is non
commercial in nature.<U> <P>
     </U><B>The Commercial Online Services</B> -- Communications over
large national computer networks known as "commercial online
services," including Prodigy, America Online and CompuServe, are
also restricted by the Act.  These services enable their customers
to communicate with other customers, access the Internet, and
access other proprietary information and services available only
to subscribers.  They have more than twelve million subscribers in
the United States and overseas; all of the major providers have
customers in Georgia and facilitate online communications into and
out of this State. Steele Aff. &#182;&#182; 19-20. <P>
     <B>Local Bulletin Board Services ("BBSs")</B> -- The Act also
restricts expression on thousands of local computer networks known
as Bulletin Board Systems, or "BBSs."   A BBS can be established
by anyone with a phone line, computer, modem, and proper software,
to allow people with common interests to communicate with each
other and share information.  There are several hundred BBSs in
Georgia, and thousands more outside the state that can be reached
from Georgia through long distance telephone lines.  Steele Aff. &#182;
21. <P>
<B><U>Methods of Online Communications Affected</B></U> <P>
     Computer users communicate with each other over computer
networks in several similar ways.  Because the restrictions
imposed by the Act apply to the <B>transmission of </B>"<B>any data</B>
<B>through a computer network</B> . . . <B>for the purpose of . . .
exchanging data with</B> an electronic mailbox, home page, or <B>any
other electronic information storage bank or point of
access to electronic information,"</B> the Act applies to
virtually any communication over these networks that originates
from, can be received in, or simply passes through the State of
Georgia.  O.C.G.A. &#167; 93-9-93.1(a) (emphasis supplied); Steele Aff.
&#182; 22.  At a minimum, the Act applies to the following types of
communications which are particularly relevant to this motion: <P>
     <B>E-mail -- </B>E-mail is the basic method of communication over
computer networks.  It allows one user to send a message to any
other user or users on the network.  Because mass mailings via e
mail are relatively easy and inexpensive, e-mail enables any user
to publish and distribute information on any topic simply by
compiling a mailing list of online users and sending the
newsletter to everyone on the list.  Steele Aff. &#182;&#182; 23-24.   <P>
     <B>Discussion groups -- </B>A second common method of
communication over computer networks are "discussion groups,"
which allow users to post public messages onto a computerized
bulletin board or to an electronic list, and to read and respond
to messages posted by others.  Computer discussion groups have
been organized on many different computer networks on virtually
every topic imaginable.  They have created an entirely new public
forum for the vigorous exchange, discussion and debate of ideas. 
These public discussion groups are one of the most popular uses of
the Internet and other computer networks.  Steele Aff. &#182;&#182; 25-26.   <P>
     <B>Chat Groups -- </B>Similar to discussion groups are "chat
groups," which allow users to converse simultaneously with each
other over computer networks by typing messages and reading
messages typed by others participating in the "chat."  Some chat
groups are organized for social entertainment, and others are
organized by a particular sponsor to provide a specific forum for
discussion of a particular topic or set of issues.  Steele Aff. &#182;&#182;
27-28. <P>
       <B>Publication & Access To Information -- </B>Finally, computer
networks provide a powerful new medium for publishing information
and for accessing information published by others.  The best
known, most accessible, and potentially most powerful publishing
medium over computer networks is the "World Wide Web" of the
Internet.  Anyone with access to the Internet and proper software
can publish <B>"web pages"</B> on the Internet, which may contain text,
images, sound and even video.  Any Internet user anywhere in the
world can view the web pages published by others, read their text,
look at their images and video, and listen to their sounds.  The
World Wide Web therefore provides citizens of ordinary means with
an extraordinary new power to publish ideas to the world and to
access the ideas and information published by others.  Steele Aff.
&#182;&#182; 29-31.   <P>
     In addition, the World Wide Web provides the unique ability
to <B>"link"</B> different web pages together to direct users to
additional web pages known to the publisher on topics of interest. 
A "link" in a web page allows a user to move from one web site to
another merely by "clicking" on specified text or graphics with a
computer mouse; the software will then automatically transfer the
user to a different location on the Internet.  A link in a web
page can lead to a different page within the same web site, or the
link may transport the user to an entirely different web site
published on an entirely different computer in a different part of
the world.  This linking ability makes the World Wide Web a unique
and powerful publishing platform, in effect tying the entire World
Wide Web together into a single interconnected body of knowledge
made up of all the individually published web pages of millions of
different users around the world.  Steele Aff. &#182;&#182; 32-37. <P>
<B>THE EFFECT OF THE ACT UPON THE PLAINTIFFS'  <P>
COMMUNICATIONS OVER COMPUTER NETWORKS</B><P>
     As set forth above, the Act imposes two restrictions upon
communications over computer networks.  The first prohibits
communications using a name that "falsely identifies" the user. 
The second prohibits the use of trade names, logos, symbols etc.
in a way that "would falsely state or imply" that the person using
the name or logo has obtained permission to do so.  Plaintiffs use
or seek to use computer networks for protected communications
prohibited by either or both of these restrictions.  <U>See</U> Exhibits
A - N, attached to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction
(plaintiffs' affidavits). <P>
<B>The Use of Pseudonyms and Other Anonymous  <P>
<U>Communications That "Falsely Identify" Online Users</B></U><P>
     Plaintiffs and many other online users communicate over
computer networks in a way that they fear may "falsely identify"
them within the meaning of the Act.  Specifically, almost every
online user is identified when they communicate online by an "e
mail address" that is not their full legal name.  For example, one
of plaintiff Jonathan Wallace's e-mail addresses is "jw@bway.net." 
Declaration of Jonathan Wallace (Ex. B) ["Wallace Aff."] &#182; 4. 
Similarly, plaintiff Bruce Mirken uses the screen name "Bmirk"
when communicating on America Online.  Declaration of Bruce Mirken
(Ex. C) ["Mirken Aff."] &#182; 4.  Although these e-mail addresses and
screen names bear some relationship to their user's real name,
they do not identify their users with specificity and therefore
may "falsely identify" their users within the meaning of the Act. 
It would be technologically impossible on many computer networks
to include a user's full name in their e-mail address. <P>
     Moreover, plaintiffs and many other online users use so
called "screen names," "handles," pen names, or other online
pseudonyms that purposefully bear no resemblance to their real
name when they communicate online.  For example, Mitchell Kaye, a
Georgia legislator, occasionally uses the pen name "publius;"
staff members of the Electronic Frontier Foundation use handles
such as "mnemonic" and "mech;" and members of Electronic Frontiers
Georgia use handles including "decius," "soth" and "pooh." 
Declaration of Mitchell Kaye (Ex. D) ["Kaye Aff."] &#182; 18; Steele
Aff. &#182; 11; Declaration of Robert Costner (Ex. E) ["Costner Aff."]
&#182; 14.  Some computer users also use "anonymous remailers" and
"anonymizers," which strip the identifying information from a
particular message or communication.  Declaration of Sameer Parekh
(Ex. F) ["Parekh Aff."] &#182;&#182; 5-7; 12-16; 20-23. <P>
     Plaintiffs and other online users communicate anonymously for
a variety of reasons.  For example, several of the plaintiffs use
screen names or pseudonyms so that they can participate
anonymously in online discussions or chats on topics that are
sensitive, embarrassing, or might subject them to social
ostracism.  Members of the AIDS Survival Project use pseudonyms to
participate in online chat groups that offer therapeutic support
to persons with AIDS and HIV.  Declaration of Jeff Graham (Ex. G)
["Graham Aff."] &#182;&#182; 6-8.  The Safer Sex Web Page hosts online
discussions on sex education topics, in which many participants
use pseudonyms to protect their anonymity.  Declaration of John
Troyer (Ex. H) ["Troyer Aff."] &#182;&#182; 12-14. <P>
     Certain plaintiffs speak anonymously online because they fear
retaliation for expressing unpopular or controversial views.  The
members of Atlanta Veterans Alliance, an organization that serves
the needs of gay, lesbian and bisexual veterans, use the Internet
anonymously not only to avoid harassment and discrimination, but
also to protect their careers since those in active military
service would face discharge if their identities were disclosed. 
Declaration of Eric Van Pelt (Ex. I) ["Van Pelt Aff."] &#182;&#182; 3,5. 
Members of the Atlanta Freethought Society participate in online
discussions anonymously because their views advocating the
separation of church and state often engender resentment and
threats from others. Declaration of Kimberly Lyle-Wilson (Ex. J)
["Lyle-Wilson Aff."] &#182;&#182; 3-6.  Plaintiff Bruce Mirken, a journalist
who writes frequently about gay issues, obtains information for
his stories from gay youth online; these youth would be unwilling
to speak to Mirken if they could not use pseudonyms to protect
their identity.  Mirken Aff. &#182;&#182; 4-9. <P>
     Certain plaintiffs use pseudonyms so that other online users
cannot find their phone number or address to contact and
potentially harass them.  For example, Bonnie Nadri, a single
mother, uses a pseudonym in chat and discussion groups on local
BBSs because she does not want strangers on the network to obtain
her real name.  Declaration of Bonnie Nadri (Ex. K) ["Nadri Aff."]
&#182;&#182; 7-9.  Josh Riley uses screen names in communications over
America Online to avoid receiving harassing or unwanted phone
calls or messages.  Declaration of Josh Riley (Ex. L) ["Riley
Aff."] &#182; 7.  Similarly, many online users, including Members of
Electronic Frontiers Georgia, the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
and the ACLU of Georgia, engage in anonymous online speech simply
to protect their privacy.  Costner Aff. &#182; 14; Steele Aff. &#182; 11;
Declaration of Teresa Nelson (Ex. M) ["Nelson Aff."] &#182;&#182; 9-11. <P>
     Three plaintiffs publish online newsletters or web pages on
topics of public interest using "pen names," <U>i.e.</U>, pseudonyms.
Jonathan Wallace, a software executive and also a recognized
author, publishes a newsletter on the Web under the pen name
Jonathan Blumen to distinguish his business identity from his
personal views.  Wallace Aff. &#182;&#182; 8-14.  Ken Leebow publishes a
newsletter under the pen name "Norman, The Ultimate Business
Surfer" as a whimsical and successful marketing strategy. 
Declaration of Kenneth Leebow (Ex. N) ["Leebow Aff."] &#182;&#182; 3-14. 
Similarly, Mitchell Kaye is a Georgia legislator who occasionally
uses the pseudonym "Publius" in e-mail and in connection with a
web page he publishes providing information on the activities of
the Georgia House of Representatives.  Kaye Aff. &#182;&#182; 4-10; 18. <P>
     Just as many plaintiffs and other online users desire
anonymity for themselves when communicating to others, many
plaintiffs believe it is important for members and users who wish
to <I>obtain</I> sensitive or controversial information to be able to
<I>access</I> that information anonymously.  <U>See, e.g.</U>, Graham Aff. &#182;&#182; 8
10 (information about AIDS/HIV); Van Pelt Aff. &#182; 5 (gay and
lesbian issues); Troyer Aff. &#182;&#182; 6-9 (safer sex information);
Wallace Aff. &#182;&#182; 15-17 (controversial political issues). <P>
     Finally, certain plaintiffs facilitate and encourage the
responsible use of anonymous communications by computer users in
order to protect their privacy.  For example, Community ConneXion
is an Internet Service Provider that operates an "anonymous
remailer," which enables any Internet user to send particular
messages anonymously over the Internet.  Parekh Aff. &#182;&#182; 12-19. 
Community ConneXion also operates a service known as the
Anonymizer, which enables any Internet user to browse and to
retrieve documents from the Internet anonymously.  Parekh Aff. &#182;&#182;
20-26.  Plaintiff Electronic Frontier Foundation encourages the
responsible use of anonymous remailers to protect their members'
privacy, and provides links to anonymous remailers available on
the Internet for use by the public.  Steele Aff. &#182; 9.  Similarly,
Electronic Frontiers Georgia plans to offer an anonymous remailer
for public use from its Internet domain in Georgia.  Costner Aff.
&#182; 13. <P>
<B><U>The Use of Trade Names and Logos Online</B></U> <P>
     Plaintiffs and other online users also make use of "trade
name[s], registered trademark[s], logo[s], legal or official
seal[s], or copyrighted symbol[s]" in their online expression, and
are fearful that their legitimate and constitutionally protected
use of these names and logos are now prohibited by the Act. 
Several of the plaintiffs publish web pages that use the trade
names, symbols or logos of others to refer or to provide links on
the World Wide Web to the organizations whose trade names, logos,
or symbols they use.  Plaintiffs Leebow, Nadri, Riley, Troyer, and
Wallace, for example, all use names, logos or symbols in this way
to direct their users to other web pages on the Internet.  Leebow
Aff. &#182;&#182; 7-8A; Nadri Aff. &#182;&#182; 3-7; Riley Aff. &#182;&#182; 3-6; Troyer Aff. &#182;&#182;
2-3, 10-11; Wallace Aff. &#182;&#182; 8, 18-19.  Some of the plaintiffs --
for example, Mitchell Kaye and Electronic Frontiers Georgia -- use
the seals or symbols of Georgia or the United States as a part of
their political and educational speech published over the World
Wide Web.  Kaye Aff. &#182;&#182; 4-11; Costner Aff. &#182;&#182; 8-11.  All of these
plaintiffs are concerned that their use of these trade names,
logos, or symbols is now prohibited by the Act, and plaintiff
Nadri has removed certain logos and images from her web page for
fear of prosecution under the law.  Costner Aff. &#182; 12; Kaye Aff.
&#182;&#182; 12-17; Leebow Aff. &#182; 15; Nadri Aff. &#182;&#182; 5-7; Riley Aff. &#182;&#182; 4 &
6; Troyer Aff. &#182; 11; Wallace Aff. &#182; 19.  Similarly, the AIDS
Survival Project seeks to publish a web page using trade names to
provide links to other web sites with information on AIDS and HIV,
but has been deterred from doing so for fear that such links will
violate the Act.  Graham Aff. &#182; 11. <P>
<U><B><CENTER>ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITIES</B></U> <P>
</CENTER>     Plaintiffs seek preliminary injunctive relief barring
enforcement of the Act because it is an unconstitutional
restriction upon the right to free expression over computer
networks.  A preliminary injunction is appropriate when the movant
establishes:  "(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the
merits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the
injunction [is] not granted; (3) that the threatened injury to the
plaintiff[s] outweighs the harm an injunction may cause the
defendant[s]; and (4) that granting the injunction would not
disserve the public interest."  <U>Teper v. Miller</U>, 82 F.3d 989, 992

 <P>
     The right to speak and publish anonymously is a fundamental
right that has its roots in a long tradition that dates to the
very founding of democracy in this country.  As one commentator
has noted, "At the time the first amendment was adopted, the
device of anonymous political authorship was well known, and
utilized by many of the founding fathers." "The Right to
Anonymity," 70 Yale L.J. 1084, 1085 (1961).  The Federalist
Papers, published during the original constitutional debates, were
published anonymously.  Thomas Paine wrote the famous pamphlet
"Common Sense" under a pseudonym.  Just last year, the Supreme
Court reaffirmed the long-recognized constitutional right to
anonymity in <U>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n</U>, 115 S.Ct. 1511
(1995) (striking down Ohio statute prohibiting anonymous
distribution of campaign literature).  The Court observed that
"'[a]nonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and even books have
played an important role in the progress of mankind.... Persecuted
groups and sects from time to time throughout history have been
able to criticize oppressive practices and laws either anonymously
or not at all.'" <U>Id</U>. at 1516 (<U>quoting</U> <U>Talley v. California</U>, 362
U.S. 60, 64 (1960) (declaring unconstitutional a California
ordinance that prohibited the distribution of anonymous
handbills))(citations omitted). <P>
     The Court has explained that a law prohibiting anonymity is a
content-based regulation because "the identity of the speaker is
no different from other components of the document's content that
the author is free to include or exclude."  115 S. Ct. at 1519. 
Moreover, "content-based regulations are presumptively invalid." 
<U>R.A.V. v. St. Paul</U>, 505 U.S. 377, 382 (1992) (emphasis supplied). 
The government may regulate the content of protected speech only
to promote a "compelling interest" and only "if it chooses the
least restrictive means to further the articulated interest." 
<U>Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC</U>, 492 U.S. 115, 126
(1989).  <B>Thus, the Court has consistently held that
prohibitions against anonymous speech are subject to
"'exacting scrutiny'" and can be upheld "only if  . . .
narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest." </B>
115 S. Ct. at 1519 (emphasis supplied). <P>
     The Supreme Court struck down statutes prohibiting anonymous
expression in both <U>McIntyre</U> and <U>Talley</U>, <U>supra</U>, because the
statutes at issue in both of those cases failed this exacting
level of scrutiny.  <U>See</U> <U>McIntyre</U>, 115 S.Ct. at 1524; <U>Talley</U>, 362
U.S. at 65.  As the <U>McIntyre</U> Court observed, neither the "interest
in preventing fraudulent and libelous statements" nor the
"interest in providing the electorate with relevant information"
was "sufficiently compelling to justify the anonymous speech ban,"
particularly because the restriction captured within its net
expression that was not false or misleading.  <U>Id</U>. at 1519-22.  In
the absence of a compelling interest, the <U>Talley</U> Court noted that
"[t]here can be no doubt that . . . an identification requirement
would tend to restrict freedom to distribute information and
thereby freedom of expression."  362 U.S. at 64. <P>
     Like the statutes invalidated in <U>McIntyre</U> and <U>Talley</U>, the
prohibition in the Georgia Act encompassing anonymous online
communications is an invalid content-based restriction upon speech
that cannot withstand strict scrutiny.  When First Amendment
rights are at stake, courts must make an independent inquiry to
assess whether the record supports the government's asserted
interests.  <U>Sable</U>, 492 U.S. at 129; <U>Landmark Comm., Inc. v.
Virginia</U>, 435 U.S. 829, 843 (1978).  The Georgia legislature
identified no compelling interest requiring its passage.  Even
assuming that the "false names" prohibition was intended to
address a perceived problem of online fraud or misrepresentation,
the prohibition is a blunderbuss attack on speech and not in any
sense narrowly tailored to achieve its ends.  The prohibition
applies regardless of whether a speaker has any intent to deceive
and regardless of whether any actual deception occurs.  The
criminal restriction therefore applies even when -- as in the case
of all of the plaintiffs in this case -- online pseudonyms are
used not to deceive but to protect privacy (<U>see</U> Nadri Aff. &#182;&#182; 8-9;
Riley Aff. &#182; 7; Costner Aff. &#182; 14; Steel Aff. &#182; 11), or as
creative expression (<U>see</U> Leebow Aff. &#182; 13), or as "a shield from
the tyranny of the majority, . . . to protect unpopular
individuals from retaliation -- and their ideas from suppression 
- at the hand of an intolerant society."  115 S.Ct. at 1524.  <U>See</U>
Graham Aff. &#182;&#182; 7-8(AIDS Survival Project); Lyle-Wilson Aff. &#182; 6
(Atlanta Freethought Society); Van Pelt Aff. &#182; 5 (Atlanta Veterans
Alliance). <P>
     Second, as in <U>McIntyre</U>, Georgia has numerous less restrictive
means to address intentional fraud and misrepresentation, in the
form of a variety of specific criminal and civil sanctions under
Georgia law.  <U>See, e.g.</U>, O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-8-3 (1996)(theft by
deception); O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93(a)(2) (1996) (computer theft by
deception); O.C.G.A. &#167; 10-1-453 (1994) (unauthorized and deceitful
use of name or seal of another); O.C.G.A. &#167; 10-1-393 (Supp. 1996)
(unfair and deceptive consumer trade practices); <U>Georgia-Pacific
Corp. v. Lieberam</U>, 959 F.2d 901, 907 (11th Cir. 1992) (common law
action for fraud).  The Act's sweeping prohibition of all
anonymous expression over computer networks therefore is not
narrowly tailored to achieve any compelling state purpose, and the
Act is an unconstitutional restriction upon speech. <P>
<B><DL>
<DL>
<DD>2.<U>The Prohibition of the Use of Pseudonyms, Pen
Names & Other Anonymous Online Speech
Unconstitutionally Violates The Plaintiffs'
Association and Privacy Rights</U></B></DL>
</DL>
 <P>
     In addition to violating their rights to free expression, the
Act's prohibition against the use of online pseudonyms violates
the right of the plaintiffs and their members to associate with
others over computer networks while protecting their anonymity. 
The prohibition of the use of pseudonyms in online communications
effectively prohibits online users, including members of
plaintiffs ACLU of Georgia, Electronic Frontiers Georgia,
Electronic Frontiers Foundation, AIDS Survival Project, Atlanta
Veterans Alliance, and Atlanta Freethought Society, from
associating in discussion or chat groups online without publicly
disclosing their identities to any other user on the network.  It
is therefore an even broader disclosure requirement than the
statutes that required organizations to disclose their membership
lists to the government, a practice the Supreme Court has
repeatedly invalidated as an unconstitutional intrusion into the
protected right of free association.  <U>See, e.g.</U>, <U>Bates v. Little
Rock</U>, 361 U.S. 516, 527 (1960) (invalidating Little Rock ordinance
requiring organizations to provide lists identifying their members
and contributors); <U>NAACP v. Alabama</U>, 357 U.S. 449, 466 (1958)
(reversing court order requiring NAACP to disclose Alabama
membership list). <P>
<B>     3.<U>The Act Violates Plaintiffs' Right to Receive
Information Anonymously</B></U><P>
     Similarly, the Act prohibits anonymity even to <I>access</I>
information online.  Just as an online user may "falsely identify"
himself under the Act when sending messages or information
anonymously or using a pseudonym, an online user may "falsely
identify" himself when searching for and retrieving information
anonymously. <P>
     Thus, the Act is analogous to the federal statute invalidated
in <U>Lamont v. Postmaster General</U>, 381 U.S. 301 (1965), which
prohibited anonymous access by traditional mail to communist
political materials.  The statute required recipients of such
material affirmatively to request receipt by delivering a reply
card to the post office, which the post office used to maintain a
list of recipients of such material.  <U>See</U> 381 U.S. at 307. 
Similarly, the Georgia Act would require people to identify
themselves publicly, in a manner which would make this information
available to the government and others, before they could receive
information to which they are constitutionally entitled.  Members
of plaintiff Atlanta Veterans Alliance would have to identify
themselves in order to retrieve information about gay and lesbian
issues.  Users of the Safer Sex Page, and members of the AIDS
Survival Project, would have to identify themselves in order to
gain access to potentially life-saving information.  Such a
requirement would chill protected expression and is clearly
unconstitutional.<P>
<B>     4.<U>The Broad Restriction On The Use of Trade Names,
Logos, Etc., Unconstitutionally Prohibits
Protected Expression<P>
</U></B>     The Act's broad restriction upon the use of trade names,
logos, etc., in online communications also tramples upon the First
Amendment.  Like the "false name" prohibition, the restriction on
the use of trade names and logos is a content-based restriction on
speech and cannot withstand the strict scrutiny that applies to
such restrictions. <P>
     First, the restriction is again a shotgun assault on speech. 
The restriction is <I>not</I> confined to commercial use of trade names
logos, etc., nor does the Act require intent to deceive or any
actual deception.  The potential breadth of this restriction is
magnified by the new technological context of the Internet,
because at least one commentator has already argued that the
unique "linking" feature of the Web may "falsely imply" official
sponsorship or permission to unsophisticated users simply because
the links provide automatic connections between web pages.  <U>See</U>
Stuart D. Levi, <U>Web-Site Hypertext Links Raise Issues of Control</U>,
Nat'l L.J., Aug. 12, 1996, at B12 (asserting that the mere link
itself combined with the use of a distinctive logo to identify it
"falsely impl[ies] formal relationships between the sites."). <P>
     The Act's language is so broad, therefore, that it appears to
prohibit even clearly noncommercial use of names and logos to
provide links in web pages in the absence of express permission
from the corporations, organizations, or agencies to whom the
links lead.  Many of the plaintiffs use trade names or logos in
this manner to create links for noncommercial purposes, and in
many cases their use of these trade names or logos occurs in the
context of political speech, religious speech, news and
commentary, and other public interest and educational expression. 
<U>See, e.g.</U>, Troyer Aff. &#182;&#182; 3-6, 10-11; Riley Aff. &#182;&#182; 4A-6; Wallace
Aff. &#182;&#182; 8-11, 18-19; Nelson Aff. &#182;&#182; 3-5, 7-8; Costner Aff. &#182;&#182; 9
12; Steele Aff. &#182; 13; Leebow Aff. &#182;&#182; 5-10; Nadri Aff. &#182;&#182; 6-7.  It
would be practically impossible for plaintiffs and other web
publishers to obtain permission for all the links in their web
sites, and eliminating links would destroy the most useful and
acclaimed feature of the World Wide Web. <P>
     That this broad restriction prohibits expression clearly
protected by the First Amendment is perhaps best illustrated by
the case of the web page published by plaintiff Mitchell Kaye and
other members of the Conservative Policy Caucus of the Georgia
House of Representatives.  <U>See</U> Kaye Aff. &#182;&#182; 4-11.  This web page
provides extensive information of public interest on the
activities of the Georgia House of Representatives and reflects
core protected political speech.  <U>See</U> <U>Buckley v. Valeo</U>, 424 U.S.

     While the State may have an interest in laws that
legitimately secure intellectual property rights, the State may
not suppress protected expression under the thin guise of
protecting intellectual property.  As one court noted, "It offends
the Constitution . . . to invoke [a state intellectual property
statute] as a basis for enjoining the noncommercial use of a
trademark by a defendant engaged in a protected form of
expression."  <U>L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc.</U>, 811 F.2d
26, 32 (1st Cir.), <U>cert. denied</U>, 483 U.S. 1013 (1987) (refusing to
apply Maine trademark anti-dilution statute to enjoin parody using
defendant's trademark); <U>see also</U> <U>Stop the Olympic Prison v.
U.S.O.C.</U>, 489 F. Supp. 1112 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (federal statute

approval in</U> <U>San Francisco Arts & Athletics v. U.S.O.C.</U>, 483 U.S.
522, 536 n.14 (1987); <U>Hustler Magazine v. Falwell</U>, 485 U.S. 46
(1988) (First Amendment barred common law action against magazine
for offensive parody using plaintiff's name and image). <P>
     It was precisely Congress' concerns about the interplay of
the First Amendment and intellectual property rights that led it
to limit expressly the scope of the new Federal Trademark Dilution
Act.  Congress made clear that the federal Act did <I>not</I> apply to
the noncommercial "use" of trademarks, nor to use of such marks in
news reporting or commentary, or fair use in comparative
advertising.  <U>See</U> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c)(4); H.R. No. 104-374 (1995),
<U>reprinted in</U> 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1029, 1031 & 1035 (explaining that
these exemptions were included to "address[] legitimate First
Amendment concerns espoused by the broadcasting industry and the
media," and that the section was "designed to preclude the courts
from enjoining speech that courts have recognized to be
constitutionally protected.").  The Act at issue in this case
contains no such exemptions, and thus restricts protected
expression. <P>
     Moreover, assuming the purpose of this vague prohibition is
to protect the intellectual property of others, there are already
numerous other less restrictive civil and criminal remedies to
achieve this end.  <U>See, e.g.</U>, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125 (federal remedy for
trademark infringement); O.C.G.A. &#167; 10-1-450 et seq. (1994) 
(Georgia remedy for trademark and trade name infringement);
O.C.G.A. &#167; 10-1-453 (1994) (unauthorized and deceitful use of name
or seal); O.C.G.A. &#167; 10-1-393 (Supp. 1996) (unfair and deceptive
consumer trade practices);  O.C.G.A. &#167; 10-1-372 (1994) (deceptive
trade practices);  <U>Jellibeans, Inc. v. Skating Clubs of Georgia,
Inc.</U>, 716 F.2d 833, 837 & n. 6 (11th Cir. 1983) (common law action
for unfair competition).  If the purpose of the restriction is to
prevent fraud, then the statutory and common law remedies
discussed in section I-A-1, <U>supra</U>, are already available for that
purpose.   <P>
       Thus, the Act's broad restriction upon the use of trade
names, logos, etc. is not narrowly tailored to serve any
compelling state interest, and is an unconstitutional content
based restriction upon protected expression. <P>
<B>     B.     <U>The Act Is Substantially Overbroad</U> <P>
</B>     The Georgia Act is also substantially overbroad, and

City of Rockford</U>, 408 U.S. 104, 114 (1972).  In the First
Amendment context, the overbreadth doctrine applies to invalidate
statutes even where some applications of the statute are valid. 
<U>See</U> <U>United States v. Salerno</U>, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987); <U>National
Treasury Employees Union v. United States</U>, 990 F.2d 1271, 1280
(D.C. Cir. 1993) (Randolph, J., concurring) (citing numerous
cases), <U>aff'd</U>, 115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995).  The rule is "based on an
appreciation that the very existence of some broadly written laws
has the potential to chill the expression of [persons] not before
the court."  <U>Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement</U>, 505 U.S. 123,
129 (1992); <U>see</U> <U>also</U> <U>Secretary of State of Maryland v. Munson</U>, 467
U.S. 947 (1984); <U>Broadrick v. Oklahoma</U>, 413 U.S. 602, 612 (1973). <P>
     The Georgia Act is a classic example of a "substantially
overbroad" law that was not written with anything like the
precision required of statutes regulating speech.  As discussed in
section I-A, <U>supra</U>, the Act prohibits a wide range of
constitutionally protected speech, including the use of pseudonyms
and anonymity to avoid social ostracism, to prevent discrimination
and harassment, and to protect privacy; and the use of trade names
or logos in non-commercial educational speech, news and
commentary, and even core political expression.  Thus, even if the
Georgia Act could constitutionally be applied to persons who
intentionally "falsely identify" themselves in order to deceive or
defraud the public, or to persons whose commercial use of trade
names and logos creates a substantial likelihood of confusion or
the dilution of a famous mark, the Act is unconstitutional under
the overbreadth doctrine because it operates unconstitutionally
for "a substantial category" of the speakers it covers (indeed,
almost every online user is potentially in violation of the
statute), <U>Village of Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better
Environment</U>, 444 U.S. 620, 634 (1980), and because it
"criminalizes a substantial amount of constitutionally protected
speech," <U>City of Houston v. Hill</U>, 482 U.S. 451, 466 (1987). <P>
     In addition, the Act's broad sweep has already chilled
protected expression -- the very vice the overbreadth doctrine was
designed to prevent.  <U>Forsyth County</U>, 112 S. Ct. at 2401; <U>Munson</U>,
467 U.S. 947; <U>Broadrick</U>, 413 U.S. at 612.  For example, the AIDS
Survival Project has placed on hold its plans to publish a web
page providing links to Internet resources on HIV and AIDS-related
topics for fear of violating the statute.  Graham Aff. &#182; 11. 
Similarly, Bonnie Nadri has altered the content of her web page
for the same reason.  Nadri Aff. &#182; 5.  It is impossible to
determine the extent to which this overbroad criminal statute may
have chilled expression by the many thousands of other computer
users potentially affected.<B> <P>
     C.     <U>The Act Is Unconstitutionally Vague <P>
</B></U>     O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1 is also invalid because it fails to
define clearly the conduct it renders criminal.  "[T]he void-for

criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people
can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that
does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement." 
<U>Kolender v. Lawson</U>, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983).  The policies
underlying the vagueness doctrine apply with special force where,
as here, the statute at issue restricts constitutionally protected
expression: <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If the Government is going to intrude upon the sacred

policies underlying the vagueness doctrine, all of which are
violated by the statute at issue in this case: (1) the Act does
not give fair notice as to the scope of conduct it proscribes, (2)
the Act provides wide leeway for arbitrary enforcement, and (3)
the Act infringes upon and has already chilled the exercise of
free expression by the plaintiffs.  <U>Grayned v. City of Rockford</U>,

<DD><B>1.<U>The "False Identification" Restriction Fails To
Give Adequate Notice of What Conduct is
Prohibited</U></B></DL>
 <P>
     The Act makes it a crime to use names that "falsely identify"
their user, but never defines the phrase "falsely identify" and
provides no guidance or standards by which the phrase is to be
defined.  The Act, for example, contains no requirement of
specific intent to deceive by the use of a false name, nor any
requirement that actual deception be proved.  This prohibition
therefore fails to meet its constitutionally required burden of
allowing "ordinary people [to] understand what conduct is
prohibited."  <U>Kolender</U>, 461 U.S. at 357. <P>
     Specifically, as set forth in section I-A, <U>supra</U>, plaintiffs
have no intent to deceive anyone by their anonymous
communications, and in fact have many legitimate and important
reasons for communicating anonymously.  Yet plaintiffs cannot
determine whether their anonymous or pseudonymous online
communications are prohibited by the Act.  <U>E.g.</U>, Costner Aff. &#182;&#182;
15-16; Graham Aff. &#182; 8; Kaye Aff. &#182; 18; Leebow Aff. &#182; 15; Lyle

&#182; 11; Riley Aff. &#182; 8; Steele Aff. &#182; 12; Van Pelt Aff. &#182; 6; Wallace
Aff. &#182; 7.  Do pseudonyms, screen names and pen names such as those
used by the plaintiffs "falsely identify" their users?  Does the
user of an anonymous remailer or an anonymizer violate the Act
because it "falsely identifies" the user?  Does the Act require
everyone communicating online to use their full legal names (a
requirement that is not technically feasible on many networks) or
to use names from which their true identities can be ascertained? 
The Act provides no answers to these questions and is therefore
void for vagueness because it fails to give a "person of ordinary
intelligence" notice as to the scope of the conduct it prohibits.

      <B>2.     <U>The Restriction on the Use Of Trade Names, Logos,
etc., Fails To Give Adequate Notice of What
Conduct is Prohibited</U></B><P>
     Similarly, the Act provides no guidance as to the meanings of
the terms "use" or "falsely imply" in its restriction on the use
of trade names and logos.  This distinguishes the Act from other
statutory protections for trademarks and similar intellectual
property under Georgia or federal law, which expressly limit the
definition of "use" to "use" in a commercial context.  <U>See, e.g.</U>,
15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125 (federal trademark infringement); O.C.G.A. &#167; 10
1-440(b) (1994) (defining "use" for purposes of Georgia trademark
and trade name infringement); O.C.G.A. &#167; 10-1-450 (1994) (Georgia
trademark & trade name infringement); O.C.G.A. &#167; 10-1-453 (1994)
(unauthorized and deceitful use of name or seal).  Similarly,
these other protections of intellectual property are typically
limited to "use" of a mark that creates a substantial likelihood
of confusion as to origin of products or services, or that creates
a risk of dilution of a famous mark.  <U>See, e.g.</U>, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125;
O.C.G.A. &#167; 10-1-450 (1994).  In contrast, the <I>only</I> limitation upon
the "use" proscribed by this Georgia statutes is that the "use"
must "falsely imply" that permission has been obtained to use the
name or symbol. <P>
     This limitation provides little if any guidance given the
unique "linking" feature of the Web.  As noted above, at least one
commentator has already argued that the mere use of a logo to
create a link is sufficient to "falsely imply formal relationship
between the sites."  Levi, <U>supra</U>, at B12.  Many of the plaintiffs
in this case "use" trade names or logos in this way in their
protected expression, with no intention whatsoever to deceive or
mislead anyone.  <U>See, e.g.</U>, Costner Aff. &#182; 12; Leebow Aff. &#182; 13;
Nadri Aff. &#182; 5; Riley Aff. &#182;&#182; 4&6; Steele Aff. &#182; 13; Troyer Aff.
&#182;&#182; 10-11; Wallace Aff. &#182;&#182; 18-19.  Is this alone sufficient to
violate the law?  The Act provides no answer to this question. <P>

<DD>3..<U>The Act's Failure to Define A "Point of Access To
Electronic Information" Renders It Impermissibly

     Moreover, the Act is vaguer still because it applies not just
to communications over computer networks but also to the
transmission of "<I>any data</I> <I>. . . over the transmission facilities
or through the network facilities of a local telephone network for
the purpose of . . . exchanging data with </I>. . . [any] <I>point of
access to electronic information</I>."  O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1 (1996)
(emphasis supplied).  There is no definition of the term "point of
access to electronic information," a phrase so vague it could
include not just any computer or modem, but also every telephone,
fax machine, answering machine, voicemail system, pager, and a
whole host of other similar electronic devices that might be
connected to telephone network facilities.  Does the Act therefore
prohibit anonymity and restrict the use of trade names in fax and
telephone communications?  Does it prohibit anonymity in
communications with voicemail, answering machines, and pagers? 
Again, the Act provides no answer to these questions.  <P>
     Persons of ordinary intelligence therefore cannot determine
from this Act whether their conduct is prohibited, and the statute
is impermissibly vague. <P>

     Because the Act fails to provide adequate guidelines for law
enforcement officials, it gives local prosecutors and police wide
leeway for selective prosecution of speech by individuals and
organizations -- like some of the plaintiffs in this case -- who
express minority or potentially unpopular social, political, or
religious views.  <U>See, e.g.</U>, Graham Aff. &#182;&#182; 7-8 (information on

in this case because the Act is a regulation of protected

"'operate[d] to inhibit the exercise of [plaintiffs' First

valuable and protected expression from the online medium.  <U>E.g.</U>,

     Finally, the Act violates the Commerce Clause of the United
States Constitution (U.S. Const, Art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 3) because the
Act restricts online communications occurring entirely outside the
State of Georgia.  <U>See</U> <U>Healy v. Beer Institute</U>, 491 U.S. 324, 336
(1989) (reaffirming that the "'Commerce Clause . . . precludes the
application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly

457 U.S. 624, 642-43 (1982)). <P>
<DL>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.<U>The Act Regulates Commerce Occurring Wholly
Outside the Borders of the State of Georgia</B></U></DL>
</DL>
 <P>
     The Georgia Act's venue provision authorizes prosecutions in
any Georgia county "from which, to which, <I>or through which</I> any use
of a computer or computer network was made."  O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9
94(4) (1996).  Viewed in context, this means the Act's
restrictions extend to a wide range of communications that occur
entirely outside this State.<P>
       First, the Act restricts virtually all online communications
that take place around the world in public discussion groups and
chat rooms on the Internet, commercial online services and many
BBSs, because public messages posted to these public fora from
anywhere in the world can be accessed by users in Georgia.  Steele
Aff. &#182; 26.  If, for example, a member of plaintiff EFF in
California posts a message to an Internet discussion group using a
pseudonym, that message may be accessed and read by a reader in
Georgia.  The posting of this message in California, therefore,
may subject the California author to prosecution in Georgia under
the Act.   Moreover, online technology provides no means for the
poster to determine whether anyone from Georgia will actually read
his message.  Thus, to avoid the risk of prosecution, the author
of the message must refrain from using a pseudonym when he posts
to the discussion group -- regardless of whether anyone in Georgia
ever actually reads any of his messages. <P>
     Second, the Act affects direct communications between persons
entirely outside of Georgia.  That is because any message sent
over the Internet can travel any number of different paths to get
to its destination.  The sender of a message cannot control the
route it takes, and any message sent over the Internet may pass
through the wires of some county in Georgia.  Steele Aff. &#182; 17. 
For example, if plaintiff Jonathan Wallace, who resides in New
York, uses his pseudonym to send an e-mail message to a California
resident, his message could travel through the state of Georgia
and place him at risk of prosecution under the Act.  Thus, a
nonresident user like plaintiff Wallace cannot use a pseudonym in
<I>any</I> online messages sent over the Internet without exposing
himself to a risk of prosecution under the Act --  even if his
messages are sent to other nonresidents of Georgia. <P>
     Third, the Act affects the ability of any online user,
regardless of whether they reside in Georgia, to access the World
Wide Web anonymously.  It is, for all practical purposes,
impossible to determine with specificity the geographic location
of the vast majority of sites on the World Wide Web.  Every web
site is identified only by an address: e.g.,  the Safer Sex Page
is located at http://www.safersex.org; EFF's web site is located
at http://www.eff.org; one of plaintiff Riley's web sites is
located at http://www.worship.com; and plaintiff EFGA's web site
is located at http://www.efga.org. Nothing in these addresses
reveals the geographic location of the sites, two of which are
maintained in Georgia and two of which are maintained outside this
state.  Troyer Aff. &#182; 1; Steele Aff. &#182;&#182; 2-4; Riley Aff. &#182;&#182; 2&4A;
Costner Aff. &#182; 8.  Thus, if a member of EFF who resides in
California accesses any web site like these anonymously, he places
himself at risk of prosecution under the Act if the web site he
accesses turns out to be located in Georgia.  To avoid the risk,
he must refrain from anonymous access to any web page on the World
Wide Web, regardless of whether any web site he actually visits is
located in Georgia. <P>
     Finally, the Act affects the ability of any online user to
<I>publish</I> a web page on the Web, regardless of whether the web site
he publishes is located in Georgia.  There is no way for a web
publisher to prevent Internet users from Georgia from accessing
web sites published on the Internet.  Thus, any web publisher
anywhere in the world -- including all of the nonresident web
publishers who are plaintiffs in this case -- must comply with the
restrictions imposed by the Georgia statute, or risk prosecution
under the Act. <P>

        Where, like the Georgia Act, a state statute directly

511, 521 (1935).  That is the appropriate result in this case,
because the statute's broad venue provision makes clear that it
applies even to interstate communications that simply pass through
Georgia, and the law has the practical effect of regulating a
substantial amount of activity occurring entirely outside the
State.    <P>

 <P>
     Even if the statute were not a <I>per se</I> violation of the
Commerce Clause, however, the law would still be an invalid state
regulation because the burdens it imposes upon interstate commerce
clearly exceed any local benefits.  <U>Brown-Forman</U>, 476 U.S. at 579;
<U>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.</U>, 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970).  As set
forth above, the Georgia Act affects a wide range of out-of-state
and protected communications which Georgia clearly has no
legitimate interest in regulating.  Moreover, the Act's
restrictions create a risk of inconsistent state regulations.  If
each of the fifty states imposed its own different regulations on
the use of trade names, logos, etc. over computer networks, every
web site operator would be subject to conflicting standards
because a web site is accessible from any state in the nation. 
<U>CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of Am.</U>, 481 U.S. 69, 88 (1987); <U>Healy</U>,
491 U.S. at 339-40.  The practical effect of the combination of
fifty different conflicting state laws regulating the Internet
would "create just the kind of competing and interlocking local
economic regulation that the Commerce Clause was meant to
preclude."  <U>Healy</U>, 491 U.S. at 337. <P>
     Arguably, therefore, the dormant Commerce Clause precludes
the entire field of online communications from state regulation
because "lack of national uniformity would impede the flow of
interstate goods."  <U>Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland</U>, 437 U.S.
117, 128 (1978); <U>Wabash St. L & P. Ry. Co. v. Illinois</U>, 118 U.S.
557 (1886) (railroad rates exempt from state regulation); <U>Southern
Pacific Co. v. Arizona</U>, 325 U.S. 761 (1945) (length of train cars
exempt from state regulation).  In any case, Georgia's attempt to
regulate this interstate (and international) telecommunications
system is an invalid exercise of State power. <P>
<B>II.<U>A SUBSTANTIAL THREAT OF IRREPARABLE INJURY EXISTS IF
THE INJUNCTION IS NOT GRANTED</U> <P>
     </B>Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the Act's
deprivation of their due process rights and rights of free
expression, association and privacy.  As the Supreme Court has
stated, "The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal
periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury." 
<U>Elrod v. Burns</U>, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (affirming order
directing district court to enter preliminary injunctive relief
where "First Amendment interests were either threatened or in fact
being impaired at the time relief was sought").  <U>See also</U> <U>Reno</U>,
929 F.Supp. at 851 ("Subjecting speakers to criminal penalties for
speech that is constitutionally protected in itself raises the
spectre of irreparable harm."). <P>
     As set forth above, plaintiffs all use the online medium to
transmit data using pseudonyms or using trade names or logos in
ways that fall within the vague and overbroad sweep of the Act. 
The Act's passage has already led some of the plaintiffs to self
censor their speech, and forces all plaintiffs to place themselves
in jeopardy of criminal prosecution as the price of exercising
their constitutional rights.  Thus, the statute "unquestionably
constitutes irreparable injury" under the controlling law.  <U>E.g.</U>,
<U>Elrod</U>, 427 U.S. at 373.  <P>
<B>III.<U>THE BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS WEIGHS IN PLAINTIFFS' FAVOR</U> <P>
</B>     If the Act is not enjoined, plaintiffs, their members, and
other online users will be forced to choose between censoring
their own protected expression over computer networks or placing
themselves at the risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement
of this vague law according to the whim of local prosecutors,
police and other enforcement authorities.  The protected speech at
issue includes material with substantial educational, political,
medical, artistic and social value.  Some of the speech that has
already been self-censored -- the information that plaintiff AIDS
Survival Project intended to publish on its planned web page --
could literally save the lives of those who are or may be affected
by this disease.  By contrast, defendants could suffer no injury
as a result of an injunction barring enforcement of this
unconstitutional law. <P>
<B>IV.</B><U><B>A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION WOULD PROMOTE THE PUBLIC
INTEREST</U> <P>
</B>     Finally, for all the reasons set forth above, the entry of a
preliminary injunction would promote, not disserve, the public
interest.  As the court observed in <U>Reno</U>, "[n]o long string of
citations is necessary to find that the public interest weighs in
favor of having access to a free flow of constitutionally
protected speech."  929 F. Supp. at 851 (Sloviter, Chief Circuit
Judge); <U>see</U> <U>Turner Broadcasting System v. FCC</U>, 114 S.Ct. 2445,
2458 (1994).   <P>
<B><CENTER><U>CONCLUSION</B></U><BR>

REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION</U><P>
</CENTER><U>INTRODUCTION</U></B><P>
     O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1 ("the Georgia Act") directly threatens
speech on the Internet, one of the most important new mediums in
the history of human communications.  The Internet provides
ordinary individuals with the ability to speak on issues of public
concern to an audience of other individuals all over the world. 
The Georgia Act prohibits anonymous and pseudonymous speech on the
Internet.  It also interferes with the system of "links" that has
made the World Wide Web (which represents one portion of the
Internet) so successful.  Plaintiffs submit this reply memorandum
in further support of their motion for a preliminary injunction
against the Georgia Act.<P>
     Defendants make only a halfhearted attempt to defend the Act
as written, arguing that it represents a constitutional response
to the state's compelling interest in preventing fraud and
deception.  That interest, however, is not an issue in this case. 
What is at issue is the means that the state has chosen to advance
its interest.  The challenged Act can only be described as an
anti-fraud statute if one completely ignores basic First Amendment
rules regarding vagueness, overbreadth and narrow tailoring.<P>
     Implicitly recognizing the weakness of their argument to
support the Act as written, defendants attempt to rewrite the Act
so that it covers only some ill-defined category of fraud and
deception.  This more narrow statute, they suggest, is
constitutional.  Defendants' proposal, however, conflicts with the
plain language of the Act.  Strikingly, none of the words
defendants use to rewrite the statute appear in it.  Moreover,
their brief asserts inconsistent and sometimes conflicting
interpretations of the statute which fail to cure its
constitutional defects.  Indeed, defendants' strained effort to
rewrite the statute merely highlights the fact that the statute
actually written by the legislature is vague and overbroad.  Under
these circumstances, the Court should not usurp the legislature's
role by performing radical surgery to save the statute, but should
instead issue a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the
Act.<P>
     Defendants also fail to address the applicable law, and the
facts about the online medium, that lead the Georgia Act to
violate the Commerce Clause.  In addition, defendants' response
raises a variety of factual disputes that make an evidentiary
hearing necessary.<P>
<B>I.     <U>THE GEORGIA ACT, AS WRITTEN, VIOLATES THE FIRST
AMENDMENT.</B></U><P>
      The Georgia Act, as written and on its face, violates the
First Amendment because it prohibits plaintiffs and others from
using pseudonyms or communicating anonymously over computer
networks, and unconstitutionally restricts the online "use" by
plaintiffs of trade names, trademarks, and logos.  <U>See</U> <U>generally</U>
Plaintiffs' Brief in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction
("Pl. Brief"); Plaintiffs' Affidavits.  In responding to
plaintiffs' motion to enjoin the Act, defendants fail to meet
their burden of establishing that the Act is narrowly tailored to
address a compelling government interest.  Moreover, defendants
fundamentally misconstrue the doctrines of substantial overbreadth
and vagueness, and wrongly assert that the Act does not regulate
speech.<P>
     <B>A.<U>The Georgia Act Regulates Speech and is Content
Based.</U></B><P>
     Defendants first argue that the Georgia Act as written does
not regulate speech, but "conduct."  That contention entirely
ignores the plain language of the statute.  The first provision
prohibits "use [of] any individual name . . . to falsely identify
the person."  As the Supreme Court has explained, names --
including pseudonyms -- are protected speech because "the identity
of the speaker is no different from other components of the
document's content that the author is free to include or exclude." 
<U>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm.</U>, 115 S. Ct. 1511, 1519 (1995);
<U>see</U> <U>also</U> Pl. Brief, at 14-17.  The second provision prohibits use
of a "trade name, registered trademark, logo [etc.] . . . [if such
use would] falsely state or imply . . . permission . . . to use
[it]."  This provision, as written, also clearly encompasses
speech, i.e., plaintiffs' and others' use of trade names and logos
in their online communications.  <U>See</U> <U>generally</U> Smolla & Nimmer on
Freedom of Speech, &#167; 12.05; <U>L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publ., Inc.</U>,
811 F.2d 26, 32 (1st Cir.), <U>cert</U>. <U>denied</U>, 483 U.S. 1013 (1987). 
The fact that this speech occurs over computer networks rather
than through print, broadcast or other media is irrelevant.  <U>See,
e.g.</U>, <U>ACLU v. Reno</U>, 929 F. Supp. 824, 883 (E.D. Pa. 1996) ("As the
most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet
deserves the highest protection from governmental intrusion."). 
The Act's prohibitions are thus readily distinguishable from
regulations of "expressive conduct" such as picketing,
handbilling, flag-burning, and mask-wearing.<P>
     Next, defendants incorrectly state that even if the Act
regulates "speech," it is not a content-based regulation of speech
but only a time, place, and manner regulation.  Defs. Brief at 21. 
A time, place, or manner regulation regulates not "'<I>what'</I> is said,
but merely such matters as '<I>when</I>,' <I>where</I>,' and '<I>how loud</I>.'" 
Smolla and Nimmer on Freedom of Speech, &#167;3.02[3][a].  The Georgia
Act's ban on the use of certain names that "falsely identify"
their users or that "falsely imply" permission to use them does
<U>not</U> regulate time, place, or manner but directly regulates the
<U>content</U> of speech.  <U>McIntyre</U>, 115 S.Ct. at 1516 ("[A]n author's
decision to remain anonymous, like other decisions concerning the
omissions or additions to the content of a  <U>publication</U>, is an
aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First
Amendment."); <U>Ward v. Rock Against Racism</U>, 491 U.S. 781, 791
(1989)  (regulations are content-based when they are grounded in
the government's "disagreement with the message [the speech]
conveys").  Because the Georgia Act is content-based, it is
subject not to the relaxed scrutiny appropriate for time, place,
and manner regulations, but rather to the strictest constitutional
scrutiny.<P>
     <B>B.     <U>The Georgia Act Fails Strict Constitutional
Scrutiny.</U></B><P>
     The Georgia Act is far from a narrowly tailored means of
addressing a compelling government interest.  <U>See</U> <U>Sable
Communications v. FCC</U>, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989); <U>R.A.V. v. St.
Paul</U>, 505 U.S. 377, 382 (1992).  Defendants attempt to meet their
burden of establishing that the Act meets strict constitutional
scrutiny by asserting a compelling interest in preventing "fraud
and deception" in the context of computer communications.  Defs.
Brief at 28.  But defendants' argument is implausible.  Other laws
already exist that address defendants' purported interest.  <U>See</U>
Pl. Brief at 17-18, 23-24.  Indeed, the Georgia General Assembly
has already extended the scope of some fraud and deception laws
specifically to the online context.  Defendants' various arguments
as to the insufficiency of existing laws are unpersuasive.  Even
if the Act prevents some ill-defined category of fraud and
deception that is not covered by existing laws, defendants fail to
explain why they would have a compelling interest in preventing
this conduct on the Internet but yet have done nothing to prevent
the same non-commercial deceptive practices in the print medium. 
<U>Denver Area Educ. Television Consortium v. FCC</U>, 116 S. Ct. 2374,
2416 (1996) (Kennedy, J., concurring) ("Partial service of a
compelling interest is not narrow tailoring.")<P>
     Finally, even if defendants' asserted interest is found to be
compelling, they have not met their burden of establishing that
the Act is a narrowly tailored means of addressing that interest. 
Indeed, the Act does not even contain the words that defendants
use to describe this interest -- i.e., "fraud and deception." 
Instead, the Act uses words that criminalize a broad range of
constitutionally protected speech -- which is far from a narrowly
tailored way to address fraud and deception.  <U>See</U> Pl. Brief at 14
18; <U>ACLU v. Reno</U>, 929 F. Supp. at 855-56 ("[I]t is difficult to
characterize a criminal statute that hovers over each content
provider, like the proverbial sword of Damocles, as a narrow
tailoring.")  <U>See</U> <U>also</U> <U>McIntyre</U>, 115 S.Ct. at 1520-22 (ban on
anonymous speech not narrowly tailored to prevent fraud).<P>
<B><DL>
<DD>C.<U>The Georgia Act is Substantially Overbroad.</U></B></DL>
For similar reasons, the Georgia Act must be enjoined because
it is substantially overbroad.  <U>See</U> Pl. Brief at 24-26.  Courts
must examine a statute that criminalizes speech <I>with particular
care</I> to ensure that it does not sweep protected speech within its
reach.  <U>See</U> <U>Houston v. Hill</U>, 482 U.S. 451, 458 (1987); <U>Kolender v.
Lawson</U>, 462 U.S. 352, 359 (1983); <U>Winters v. New York</U>, 333 U.S.
507, 515 (1948).  It is no defense to a First Amendment
overbreadth challenge that the government can conceive of some
circumstance in which speech encompassed by the Act could
constitutionally be punished -- for example, if the Act's
prohibition on speech that "falsely identifies" were applied to
harmfully fraudulent speech.  The overbreadth doctrine is
specifically designed to protect against the chilling effect on
protected speech that results when overbroad laws provide
prosecutors with unfettered discretion.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, <U>Hill</U>, 482 U.S.
at 465, and cases cited at n.15.<P>
<B>     D.     <U>The Act Is Unconstitutionally Vague.</U></B><P>
     Defendants' assertion that the Georgia Act, as written, is
not unconstitutionally vague is contradicted by both the language
of the statute itself and defendants' inability to describe the
Act's coverage with any clarity.  <U>See</U> <U>infra</U> Section II; Pl. Brief
at I.C.  None of the cases cited by defendants as examples of laws
that survived vagueness challenges involved language identical or
even similar to the language of the Georgia Act.  <U>See</U> Defs. Brief
at 35-36.  The Georgia Act, on its face, lacks the high level of
exactness required to "define the criminal offense with sufficient
definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is
prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement."  <U>Kolender v. Lawson</U>, 461 U.S. 352,
357 (1983).  Because the Act bans protected speech, a particularly
stringent vagueness test should apply.  <U>See</U> <U>Village of Hoffman
Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.</U>, 455 U.S. 489, 499
(1982).<P>
<B>II.<U>THE STATUTE CANNOT BE NARROWLY CONSTRUED TO ELIMINATE
ITS CONSTITUTIONAL FLAWS.</B></U><P>
     Given the weakness of their response to the constitutionality
of the Act as written, defendants attempt to rewrite the Act to
cure its constitutional defects.  Defendants' efforts should not
distract the Court from the actual terms of the law.  Under the
"'golden rule' of statutory construction," the Court is required
"to follow the literal language of the statute 'unless it produces
contradiction, absurdity or such an inconvenience as to insure
that the legislature meant something else.'"  <U>Telecom*USA, Inc. v.
Collins</U>, 260 Ga. 362, 363, 393 S.E.2d 235, 237 (1990); <U>see also</U> 
<U>Griffin v. Kraft General Foods, Inc.</U>, 62 F.3d 368, 372 (11th Cir.
1995) ("Statutory construction begins with the words of the
statute itself.").  Thus, as the Supreme Court made clear in
<U>Virginia v. American Booksellers Assoc.</U>, 484 U.S. 383, 397 (1988),
it is only if a statute is "'readily susceptible' to a narrowing
construction" that such an interpretation will be applied to save
an otherwise questionable law.<P>
     Specifically, defendants contend at various points throughout
their brief that the Act prohibits a narrower scope of activity
than that encompassed in the actual language of the Act.  They
describe this scope variously as:<P>
&#128;"fraud and deception, i.e., ...the transmission of misleading
data via computer networks, through the knowing false
identification of oneself as another, including by
misappropriating another's registered trade name, trademark,
logo, or seal to falsely identify oneself as someone else." 
Defs. Brief at 6.<P>
&#128;"computer fraud by persons or organizations misidentifying<U>
</U>themselves as someone else, and basically stealing someone
else's name or identity for use in that environment."  <U>Id</U>.<P>
&#128;"fraudulently using someone else's name."  <U>Id</U>. at 7.<P>
&#128;"set[ting] up or maintain[ing] a fraudulent home page."  <U>Id</U>.<P>
&#128;"knowingly lying and committing fraud about one's name, trade
name, registered trademark logo, or seal."  <U>Id</U>.<P>
<B>&#128;</B>intentionally commit the specific fraudulent act of
transmitting data which falsely identifies oneself as another
person or entity.  <U>Id</U>. at 14.<P>
<B>&#128;</B>"fraudulent transmission of data over computer."  <U>Id</U>. at 22.<P>
&#128;fraud and deception through the transmission of knowingly and
intentionally false data which misappropriates someone else's
identity or identifying mark"  <U>Id</U>. at 27.<P>
&#128;"sites which misidentify the person . . . by falsely stating
or implying that the person has permission or is authorized
to use the trade names and logos . . . when the person has no
such permission or authorization."  <U>Id</U>. at 39.<P>
<B>&#128;</B>"fraud or misrepresentation . . . knowing and intentional
misappropriation."  <U>Id</U>. at 40.<P>
     As these examples illustrate, the defendants propose a
construction of O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1 that differs in at least
three ways from the plain language of the statute itself:<P>
     (1)     They add an ill-defined element of "fraud," or an ill
defined specific intent requirement of "intent to defraud," or
"intent to deceive;"<P>
     (2)     They add a requirement of misappropriation of the
identity of another specific entity or person; and<P>
     (3)     They offer two conflicting, interpretations of the Act's
second restriction, which prohibits "use" of a "trade name,
registered trademark, logo, legal or official seal, or copyrighted
symbol" in a way that falsely implies permission:<P>
          (a)     They suggest the elimination of the second
restriction imposed by the statute by contending that this "use"
is prohibited <U>only</U> when the name or logo is used to "falsely
identify" the user.<P>
          (b)     They imply that the second provision could in some
circumstances reach the creation on a Web site of a link using
trade names or logos if the creator does not obtain permission,
but they fail to define those circumstances.<P>
     As discussed in detail below, this radical re-drafting must
be rejected because it conflicts with the plain language of the
Georgia Act.  Moreover, defendants' proposal is as confusing as
the language of the Act itself, and fails to remedy the Act's
vagueness and overbreadth.<P>
     <B>A.<U>Defendants' Attempt To Add An Ill-Defined "Fraud"
or "Specific Intent" Element Should Be Rejected.</B></U><P>
     First, defendants contend that the Georgia Act prohibits
"false identification" in online communications <U>only</U> when it
constitutes "fraud," or is undertaken with some ill-defined
specific intent the defendants variously describe as "fraudulent"
intent, "intent to deceive," or "intent to defraud."<P>
<B>           1.<U>The Defendants' Specific Intent Argument
Simply Adds to the Vagueness Problem.<P>
</B></U>               <P>
     The various terms the defendants use to describe this alleged
additional element of the crime -- such as "fraud," "intent to
defraud" and "intent to deceive" -- are <U>not</U> synonymous.  <U>E.g.</U>,
<U>United States v. Godwin</U>, 566 F.2d 975, 976 (5th Cir. 1978). 
"[I]ntent to defraud," for example, means a specific intent to
"deprive [a victim] of some right, interest or property by
deceit."  <U>Id</U>.  <U>United States v. Godwin</U>, 566 F.2d 975, 976 (5th
Cir. 1978).  The phrase "fraudulent intent" is sometimes used by
Georgia courts interchangeably with "intent to defraud."  <U>See,
e.g.</U>, <U>Bivens v. State</U>, 153 Ga. App. 631, 632, 266 S.E.2d 304,305
(1980).  On the other hand, "intent to deceive" means a specific
intent to "cause [a victim] to believe the false or to mislead."
566 F.2d at 976.  And in contrast to both of these, "fraud"
encompasses not just knowledge of falsity <U>and</U> a specific intent to
deceive, but actual reliance by the victim, and resulting injury. 
<U>See, e.g.</U>, <U>Georgia -Pacific Corp. v. Lieberam</U>, 959 F.2d 901, 907
(11th Cir. 1992); <U>Guernsey Petroleum v. Data General Corp.</U>, 183
Ga. App. 790, 793, 359 S.E.2d 920, 923 (1987).<P>
     The defendants never explain which of these distinct elements
they propose to engraft onto the statute.  This lack of clarity
makes defendants construction implausible.  In addition, their
construction remains unconstitutionally vague because it fails to
"give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity
to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly." 
<U>Grayned v. City of Rockford</U>, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972).<P>
          <B>2.<U>The Construction Conflicts With The Plain
Language of the Statute.</U></B><P>
     Moreover, their attempt to add a specific intent element
conflicts with the statute's plain language.  Neither "fraud,"
"fraudulent," "intent to defraud" "fraudulent intent," nor "intent
to deceive" appear anywhere in the language of the Georgia Act. 
In contrast, other Georgia criminal statutes which include similar
specific intent elements do so expressly.  For example, the
forgery statute makes it illegal to make, alter or possess a
"writing in a fictitious name . . . <U>with intent to defraud</U>." 
O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-1(a).  Similarly, O.C.G.A. &#167; 10-1-453 makes it
illegal to use the name of another "<U>with intent to deceive</U> the
public.".  <U>See also</U> O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-2 (creation or possession of
forged document, requiring "intent to defraud"); O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-8-3
(theft by deception, requiring intent to deceive).<P>
     "Where [the legislature] knows how to say something but
chooses not to, its silence is controlling."  <U>In re Haas</U>, 48 F.3d
1153, 1156 (11th Cir. 1995). <U>Accord</U> <U>BFP v. Resolution Trust Co.</U>,
114 S. Ct. 1757, 1761 (1994) ("[I]t is generally presumed that
[the legislature] acts intentionally and purposely when it
includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits
it in another.").  The fact that the General Assembly has
routinely included language expressly adding the elements of
fraud, intent to defraud, or intent to deceive in other criminal
statutes but chose <U>not</U> to include similar language in the Act at
issue in this case demonstrates that defendants' proposed rewrite
does not comport with the legislature's intent.<P>
     Defendants' contention that the term "falsely" in the Georgia
Act should by itself be construed to incorporate this amorphous
specific intent element into the statute conflicts with the plain
and ordinary sense of this word: in its ordinary sense, "falsely"
means simply "wrongly," "incorrectly," or "not truthfully."  <U>E.g.</U>,
Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 819 (1976); <U>see, e.g.</U>, <U>Salmon
v. Commercial Union Ins. Co.</U>, 154 Ga. App. 8, 8, 267 S.E.2d 273,
274 (1980) (Webster's New Int'l Dictionary used to establish the
plain meaning of words); <U>Sabel v. State</U>, 24 Ga. 10, 12, 282 S.E.2d
61, 64, <U>cert</U>. <U>denied</U>, 454 U.S. 973 (1981) ("Where a word is not
defined in a statute, it generally will be given its ordinary
meaning.").  The defendants' strained interpretation of this term
also contradicts the definition adopted in <U>Laughlin v. Bon Air
Hotel</U>:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"[T]he word "false" has two distinct and well-recognized
meanings. [It signifies] intentionally or knowingly, or
negligently <U>untrue</U>, [and] <U>untrue</U> by mistake, accident or
honestly after the exercise of reasonable care.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
85 Ga. App. 43, 46, 68 S.E.2d 186, 189 (1951).  Construed even in
the stricter of these two ordinary senses, the Georgia Act is
clearly broad enough to ban the knowing use of fictitious names of
any kind and for any purpose in online communications, including
the use of pseudonyms to protect privacy and anonymity.<P>
<B><U>     </U>     3.<U>The General Rule Requiring General Criminal
Intent Does Not Support Defendants'
Construction.</U></B><P>
     The rule requiring proof of general criminal intent is simply
a requirement that an offender "intend[] the consequences of his
physical actions."  <U>Holloway v. McElroy</U>, 632 F.2d 605, 618 n. 26
(5th Cir. 1980) ("General intent is an essential element of all
crimes under Georgia law (except those involving criminal
negligence)."); <U>see</U> O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-2-1.  In the case of the Georgia
Act, the requisite general intent is stated in the statute, which
requires a "knowing" violation.  This means only that to violate
the law a person transmitting data over a computer network must
<U>know</U> he is doing so, and <U>know</U> he using a name that falsely
identifies himself.  <U>See</U> <U>United States v. Smith</U>, 523 F.2d 771, 774
(5th Cir. 1975) ("'Knowingly' requires only that the defendant
acted 'with knowledge.'").  The <U>Tidwell v. State</U> decision, relied
upon by the defendants, simply stands for this same proposition. 
<U>See</U> 216 Ga. App. 8, 12, 453 S.E.2d 64, 67 (1994).<P>
     General intent is distinct, however, from "specific intent,"
which refers to a specific culpable mental state included as an
independent additional element of certain crimes.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>,
<U>Holloway</U>, 632 F.2d at 618 n. 26 (murder includes specific intent
element of premeditation).  "Intent to defraud" and "intent to
deceive" are <U>specific intent</U> elements of the crimes to which they
apply.  <U>See, e.g.</U>, <U>Lewis v. State</U>, 180 Ga. App. 890, 891, 351
S.E.2d 100, 102 (1986) (intent to defraud is "specific intent
[which is] an essential element" of forgery under Georgia law);
<U>United States v. Lichenstein</U>, 610 F.2d 1272, 1276-77 (5th Cir.
1980) ("intent to deceive" a specific intent element of federal
false statement statute).  As set forth above, criminal statutes
incorporating these elements contain express language adding them. 
No such language appears in the Georgia Act.<P>
     The defendants reliance upon <U>United States v. Lichenstein</U>,
610 F.2d 1272, as support for the claim that a specific intent
requirement should be read into the Act is not on point.  Unlike
the Georgia Act, which requires only a "knowing" violation, the
federal false statement act at issue in <U>Lichenstein</U> expressly
requires proof of a "knowing <U>and willful</U>" violation.  It is the
<U>willfulness</U> requirement that courts have interpreted to require a
"specific intent" to deceive.  <U>See, e.g.</U>, <U>United States v. Markee</U>,
425 F.2d 1043, 1046 (9th Cir. 1970); see <U>United States v. Smith</U>,
523 F.2d 771, 774 (5th Cir. 1975).  Even with this willfulness
element, the courts have held that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 does <U>not</U>
require proof of a specific intent to defraud.  <U>E.g.</U>,610 F.2d at
1276-77.  These cases therefore do not support the defendants'
proposed construction of the Georgia Act.<P>
<B>     B.<U>The Georgia Act Also Omits Any "Misappropriation
of the Identity of Another" Element</B></U><P>
     Similarly, there is no support in the Act for the defendants'
second proposed additional element, a requirement that an offender
misappropriate the identity of another specific entity or person,
rather than simply to "falsely identify" himself with a fictional
name or pseudonym.  Words like "misappropriate" or "steal" or any
similar language requiring identification as a specific other
person or entity are again conspicuously absent from the Georgia
Act, which by its plain terms is broad enough to encompass false
identification of the offender by the use of a pen name or
pseudonym as well.<P>
     In contrast, where the General Assembly intends to include
such an element, it knows how to do so expressly.  O.C.G.A. &#167; 10
1-453, for example, makes it illegal to "use the name or seal of
any other person, firm, corporation, or association . . . with
intent to deceive the public.").  Thus, the legislature's omission
of this language from the Georgia Act is controlling on the
question of construction and the Court should not engraft onto
this plain language the additional "misappropriation of identity"
element the defendants propose.<P>
<B><DL>
<DL>
<DD>C.<U>Defendants' Rewrite of The Second Restriction
Must Also Be Rejected.</B></U></DL>
</DL>
<P>
     Finally, the defendants' construction of the <U>second</U>
prohibition in the Georgia Act -- <U>i.e.</U>, the prohibition against
the "use" of a "trade name, registered trademark, logo, legal or
official seal, or copyrighted symbol" in a way that falsely
implies permission -- fails to cure the Act's constitutional
defects.  Defendants appear to propose two conflicting
interpretations of this provision.  First, they claim that the
statute <U>as a whole</U> prohibits only "falsely identify[ing] oneself
by misappropriating another's identity or identifying mark without
permission or authority."  Defs. Brief at 14.  This suggests that
the "false identification" requirement in the first clause should
be engrafted onto the second as well, merging these separate
clauses into a single prohibition against false identification in
online communication.  Once again, their construction finds no
support in the statutory language.  The second restriction does
not require "false identification" at all, but rather simply
prohibits the "use" of any trade name or logo in online
communications if the use "would falsely state or imply that [the
user] has permission or is legally authorized to use [it]." 
O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1.<P>
     Moreover, it violates the rule that a statute must be
interpreted "to give effect to each of its provisions; any
interpretation which renders parts or words in a statute
inoperative or superfluous is to be avoided."  <U>United States v.
Brame</U>, 997 F.2d at 1428; <U>see also</U> <U>United States v. Phipps</U>, 81 F.3d
1056, 1060 (11th Cir. 1996).  Thus, once again, their proposed
construction both contradicts the statutory language and violates
the rules of statutory construction, and must be rejected.<P>
     Second, defendants' brief contains language that lends
support to the argument that the plain language of the second
provision prohibits the use of trade names and logos to create
links on the World Wide Web.  <U>See</U> Pl. Brief at 28-29.  For
example, defendants assert that the second provision prohibits
"sites . . . which misidentify the person by . . . falsely stating
or implying that the person has permission or is authorized to use
the trade names and logos . . . when the person has no such
permission or authorization."  Defs. Brief at 39.  Later,
defendants write:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The hypertext links commonly used on the World Wide Web
are, without the injection of fraud or
misrepresentation, merely references to the computer
site and computer address of another person or entity on
the Internet or Web.  Without the injection of the
knowing and intentional misappropriation of another's
identity or identifying mark into such situation, the
statute poses no obstacle to innocent links.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Defs. Brief at 40.  Neither of these statements resolves the
question of whether maintenance of a site on the World Wide Web
that uses a trade name or logo to create a link to another site
would be a violation of the Act because it "falsely implies"
permission to create the link or because it "misappropriat[es]
another's . . . identifying mark."  Thus, for example, plaintiff
Electronic Frontiers Georgia still does not know whether its use
of the BellSouth logo to create a link on its Web page to the
BellSouth Web site violates the Act.  <U>See</U> Costner Aff. &#182; 10.
Defendants' inability to put forth a consistent interpretation of
the second provision, and the continuing ambiguity of one of those
interpretations, support plaintiffs' claim that the second
provision is unconstitutionally vague.<P>
<DL>
<DD><B>D.<U>The Legislator Affidavits Submitted by Defendants
Cannot Support a Construction that Contradicts
the Language of the Georgia Act.</U></B></DL>
<P>
     Despite the language of the statute, defendants argue that it
should be read as they propose because they claim this was the
"intent" of the General Assembly.  Defendants support this claim
with the affidavits of five legislators who aver that the statute
was <U>intended</U> to cover only "the fraudulent and deceitful
misidentification of oneself, including by using someone else's
mark or seal to misidentify oneself, as someone else."  Watson
Aff. &#182; 6; <U>see also</U> Ray Aff. &#182; 5; Parsons Aff. &#182; 4; Skipper Aff.
&#182; 8; Lawrence Aff. &#182; 5.<P>
     This argument must be rejected because these affidavits
<U>cannot even be considered</U> in interpreting O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1. 
"[T]he testimony of a legislator, with respect to the legislative
intent underlying the enactment of a particular piece of
legislation, is inadmissible."  <U>Jackson v. Delk</U>, 257 Ga. 541, 542,
361 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1987).  <U>Accord</U> <U>Fulton County v. Dangerfield</U>,
260 Ga. 665, 666, 398 S.E.2d 14, 15 (1990); <U>Stewart v. Atlanta
Beef Co.</U>, 93 Ga. 12, 18, 18 S.E. 981, 985 (1893).<P>
     The seminal case articulating this rule is <U>Stewart v. Atlanta
Beef Co.</U>, which stated:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[I]t cannot be seriously contended that courts can
properly resort to sources of this kind in ascertaining
the legislative will as expressed in a statute.  These
gentlemen might differ as to what an act did mean, which
would only increase, rather than relieve, any difficulty
a court might have in construing the law. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
93 Ga. at 18, 18 S.E. at 985 (quoted in <U>Fulton County v.
Dangerfield</U>, 260 Ga. at 666, 398 S.E.2d at 15).  In fact, one of
the affidavits expressly acknowledges that these five legislators
"obviously ... cannot speak for the General Assembly as whole." 
Lawrence Aff. &#182; 5.  Their testimony after the fact has no
probative value on anything but their own state of mind, and has
no bearing on legislative intent of the General Assembly as a
whole.  <U>See, e.g.</U>, <U>Chandler v. Miller</U>, 73 F.3d 1543, 1549 n.5
(11th Cir. 1996) (rejecting post-enactment statements by Georgia
legislator who was sponsor of bill as incompetent legislative
history); <U>Goolsby v. Blumenthal</U>, 581 F.2d 455, 460 (5th Cir. 1978)
(rejecting "post-passage remarks of legislators" as incompetent
legislative history representing only the "personal views of these
legislators"); <U>McKenzie v. Snow</U>, 675 F. Supp. 1333, 1338 n.2 (N.D.
Ga. 1987) (discounting affidavit testimony by bill's sponsor as to
his intent in drafting statute under consideration).<P>
     The Parsons affidavit clearly illustrates the confusion such
affidavits can produce.  Although he avers that he "has never
stated" that the Georgia Act would "cause or dictate that" the
Conservative Policy Caucus web page maintained by Plaintiff
Mitchell Kaye "would be shut down," <U>see</U> Parsons Aff. &#182; 25, he
nevertheless did express, during floor debates on the bill and to
the press, his understanding that Rep. Kaye's web page --
notwithstanding its prominent disclaimers -- was exactly the sort
of "situation" that the bill "would address."  Such ambiguity and
conflicting evidence with respect to the "intent" of just one
member of the General Assembly demonstrates precisely why Georgia
courts do not permit this kind of <U>post hoc</U> legislative history.<P>
     The affidavits are particularly inappropriate here, where
they are offered to contradict the plain language of the statute
itself.  The "plain language" rule of statutory construction
applies with even greater force in construing a Georgia statute
because of the absence of any formal legislative history:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[B]ecause the State of Georgia maintains no formal
legislative history for its statutes, the best evidence
of the intent of the General Assembly is the language of
the statute.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<U>Duke v. Cleland</U>, 884 F. Supp. 511, 515 (N.D. Ga. 1995).  <U>See also</U>
<U>Duke v. James</U>, 713 F.2d 1506, 1511 (11th Cir. 1983) (construction
of Alabama statute must be determined from statutory language
because Alabama maintains no formal legislative history).<B><P>
     E.     <U>Defendants' Proposed Rewrite Is Not Binding</U><P>
</B>     Even if defendants' proposed rewrite of the Act were clear,
it would not be sufficient.  The interpretation of an agency
charged with enforcing a statute is not binding on the courts
"when it goes beyond the meaning that the statute can bear."  <U>MCI
Telecommunications v. ATT</U>, 512 U.S. 218, 114 S. Ct. 2223, 2231
(1994); <U>Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Yueh-Shaio Yang</U>,
65 U.S.L.W. 4009, 4011 (Sup. Ct., November 13, 1996).  In Georgia,
even the formal opinions of the Attorney General (which this brief
most certainly is not), are not binding on the state courts who
would hear prosecutions or civil actions brought under the Georgia
Act.  <U>Warestores v. Nash</U>, 125 Ga. App. 210 (1971); <U>Johnson v.
Public Finance Corp.</U>, 126 Ga. App. 557 (1972).<B><P>
III.<U>THE STATUTE VIOLATES THE COMMERCE CLAUSE.</U></B><P>
     In their initial memorandum, plaintiffs explained that the
Georgia Act is a per se violation of the Commerce Clause because
it restricts online communications occurring entirely outside the
State of Georgia.  Pl. Brief at I.D.1-2.  Defendants address
neither the facts about the online medium which lead to the
Commerce Clause violation, nor the applicable law.  They simply
fail to discuss the tremendous reach of the Act's venue provision,
which authorizes prosecutions based on any communication that
passes "through" the wires of Georgia.  <U>See</U> O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-94(4). 
Thus, defendants' arguments ignore the critical fact that this law
not only regulates conduct that may cause harm inside Georgia, but
also prohibits a wide array of communications over computer
networks that take place entirely outside the state and cause no
harm of any kind in Georgia.  This alone renders O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9
93.1 <U>per se</U> invalid under the dormant Commerce Clause as a direct
regulation of interstate commerce, and makes the balancing of
burdens analysis unnecessary.  <U>See</U> Pl. Brief at II.D.1-2.<P>
     Defendants focus instead only on the second relevant inquiry
under Commerce Clause analysis, and concede that a statute may be
invalid if the burdens it imposes upon interstate commerce clearly
exceed any local benefits.  <U>See</U> Pl. Brief at II.D.3.  But
defendants then fail to engage in this balancing.  If each state
can separately and contradictorily regulate all of the speech on
the Internet, and speakers cannot comply with those requirements
without refraining from speech, the burden on interstate commerce
is overwhelming.  Defendants provide no legitimate explanation for
their interest in such a far-reaching law and no justification for
its devastating impact on interstate commerce.  Defendants
therefore fail to rebut the inescapable conclusion that the
Georgia Act violates the Commerce Clause.<P>
<B>IV.<U>AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING IS NECESSARY TO RESOLVE THE
PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION</U>.</B><P>
     Defendants' proposed rewrite of the statute implicitly
suggests that the only question presented to the Court is a pure
question of statutory interpretation.  To the contrary,
defendants' response highlights a number of factual disputes that
make an evidentiary hearing necessary.<P>
     First, defendants ignore the Act's impact on the widespread
use of pseudonyms and other anonymous communications in a variety
of forums on the Internet, as described in detail in plaintiffs'
initial memorandum and supporting affidavits.<P>
     Second, defendants suggest that Web links using trade names
and logos are not prohibited by the Act because Web users commonly
understand that such links do not "falsely imply" permission. 
Defs. Brief at 11.   But as plaintiffs' affidavits suggest, it is
not as simple as defendants suggest for casual, unsophisticated
web users to understand the relationship between linked sites.<P>
     Third, defendants' argument that the Act does not violate the
Commerce Clause simply ignores extensive facts about the nature
and variety of Internet communications which illustrate the Act's
impact on speech occurring wholly outside of Georgia.  <U>See</U> <U>supra</U>
Section III.<P>
     Finally, defendants mischaracterize the Internet as a
"lawless place" where there is no recourse for stolen identities
or identifying marks.  An evidentiary hearing is required to
illustrate the protective procedures set up by the Internet
community itself to address precisely defendants' concern.<P>
<CENTER><U><B>CONCLUSION</B></U><BR>
</CENTER>     For these reasons, plaintiffs respectfully ask that the Court
set the motion for a preliminary injunction for an evidentiary
hearing.<P>

<P>Patrick Ball began designing human rights databases in El Salvador in 1991
when he worked with the non-governmental Human Rights Commission of El Salvador
(CDHES) on the Indices of Individual Responsibility Project. Using simple
databases, the CDHES linked information from 7,000 testimonies of human rights
violation witnesses and victims to the individual military and police officers
who commanded the units that committed the violations. The CDHES gave human
rights dossiers on over 400 of the most senior officers to the Truth Commission
and to the Commission that reviewed officers' records in the transition to
peace; this information was critical in the Commission's identification of the
most egregious human rights violators during the civil war.</P>
<P>Since El Salvador, Patrick has provided technical assistance in information
management and data security to the truth commissions in Haiti and South Africa,
the U.N. Mission in Guatemala, and non-government human rights organizations in
Haiti, Guatemala, and Turkey.  He is finishing a Ph.D. dissertation in political
sociology at the University of Michigan on the emergence of the international
human rights movement, and he is currently a Senior Program Associate in the

<H3>DECLARATION OF PATRICK BALL</H3>
<P>District of Columbia</P>
<P>1. </P>
<P>My name is Patrick Ball.  I am employed as Senior Program Associate in the
Science and Human Rights Program of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science (AAAS).  The Science and Human Rights Program works to promote
respect for the human rights of scientists, and to advance the use of scientific
techniques in human rights work.  I submit this affidavit only on my own behalf.
 The opinions expressed herein are my own, and should in no way be construed as
those of the AAAS.</P>
<P>I have an A.B. degree from the Columbia College of Columbia University
(sociology, 1988), and an M.A. in political sociology from the University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor (1991).  I am currently finishing a Ph.D. dissertation
entitled &quot;Liberalism Revisited:  the Social and Ideological Origins of the
Human Rights Movement.&quot;  In the research for this dissertation, I have made
an in-depth study of how non-government human rights monitoring organizations
form, and once formed, how they work.  I have written technical papers on
database design and information management for various human rights groups, U.S.
specialist publications, and for the Pan-African Development Information Service
of the United Nations, and on the political sociology of human rights
organizations, among other topics. An accurate copy of my curriculum vitae is
attached.</P>
<P>I have worked with the AAAS since 1993. I was a consultant to the Science
and Human Rights Program until August, 1996, when I joined the staff.  My
principal work with the AAAS is to assist grassroots non-government human rights
organizations and truth commissions to build information management systems.  I
help them to figure out what information they need to collect, how to collect
it, how to represent the information in a computer database, and then how to
analyze it.  During 1991-1993, I did this work in El Salvador and Ethiopia. 
Since 1993, I have worked on behalf of the AAAS in Haiti, Guatemala, South
Africa, and Turkey.   In Ethiopia, Haiti, and South Africa I worked with
quasi-governmental tribunals and truth commissions; other organizations I have
worked with include non-government monitoring groups and U.N. human rights
missions.  I have recently published a brief overview of this work in a volume
entitled <I>Who Did What to Whom?  Planning and Implementing a Large-Scale
Human Rights Data Project</I> (Washington, DC: AAAS, 1996).  With two colleagues
from the AAAS, I will publish in 1997 a book entitled <I>Safe Computing in a
Dangerous World:  a Handbook on Cryptographic Applications for Human Rights Work</I>.</P>
<P>In the course of my work, my partner organizations and I concentrate
politically volatile information in computers.   For example, one database I

designed contains the names of witnesses to military massacres in Guatemala;
another keeps the names of applicants for amnesty for political crimes carried
out in South Africa during the <I>apartheid</I> regime.  Both groups of people
could be subject to intimidation, harassment, or murder by those intent on
preventing the public discussion and analysis of the claims.  Both systems are
protected by strong cryptography(1).</P>
<P>Many human rights organizations have grave concerns about the security of
their information.  Often they ask me how they can protect their information
while it is physically inside their organization, and how they can secure their
Internet-based communications.  Because human rights organizations often operate
in hostile political environments, and because the information they acquire is
often very sensitive, questions about security must be taken seriously. Every
year, many human rights workers are killed in the course of their work.  The
principal reason they are captured, tortured, and killed is so that their
captors can obtain information from them.  Quite often the captors are
government agents, acting either openly or as civilian death squads.  Computers
are also vulnerable to capture, which is why organizations want to protect
information in its electronic form.  </P>
<P>Because human rights work is so dangerous, many non-government groups
operate clandestinely.  Quasi-governmental human rights organizations such as
truth commissions, and inter-governmental bodies such as the Organization of
American States and United Nations monitoring missions operate publicly but also
have serious information security concerns.  The discussion below applies,
although in slightly different ways, to all of the human rights organizations
with whom I have worked.</P>
<P>Human rights groups respond to danger at the electronic level by adopting
one or more of three measures:  <B>a</B>) encryption for content security, <B>b</B>)
digital signatures to assure message integrity and authenticity, and <B>c</B>)
transmission of information by anonymous techniques.  Encryption means that the
original message is transformed in a way such that only the recipient can
recover the original message; using modern encryption, even the sender cannot
recover the original message after it has been encrypted.  Digital signatures
are sub-messages which can be affixed to an electronic document (including but
not limited to an email message).  Signatures serve to verify that <B>i</B>)
only the signer could have signed the document, and that <B>ii</B>) the
document has not been altered since it was signed.  Both encryption and digital
signatures are quite important for human rights work.</P>
<P>A third kind of computer security technique important for human rights
organizations is called anonymous remailing. It is important to note that all
email messages contain header information indicating the electronic addresses of
both the sender and the recipient.  Anonymous electronic communication can be
used to defeat traffic analysis.  Traffic analysis is an attack in which the
attacker studies the patterns of correspondence shown by the headers of the
messages passing through a particular account.  The attacker determines to whom
the account sends information, and from whom the account receives information.
By analyzing this information, the attacker can determine with whom the human
rights organization corresponds, as well as when the correspondence occurred,
and what quantity of information was exchanged.</P>

<P>Human rights organizations use anonymity to defeat traffic analysis. 
Anonymity in this sense means that someone watching the sender of a message
cannot tell where the message is going; analogously, someone watching the
computer account of the receiver of a message cannot determine from whom the
message originated. At the simplest, and least safe, level the sender might use
a pseudonym.</P>
<P>An attacker who wishes to conduct traffic analysis needs either <B>a</B>)
low-level access to the computer system on which the account's email resides,
called the mail host; or <B>b</B>) physical access to the human rights
organization's computer (e.g., by seizing it). The attack suggested in <B>a</B>)
can be used no matter what kind of email system the human rights organization
uses.  If the human rights group uses a mail system which stores mail on their
PC(2), rather than leaving it on the mail host, the attack suggested in <B>b</B>)
would also work.  The attacker does not need to be able to access the messages'
contents.  Instead he needs only to study the sending and receiving information
stored in the message headers.</P>
<P>Traffic analysis can betray devastating information about a human rights
group.  For example, if a law firm is offering legal assistance to ensure due
process for people accused of nonviolent political crimes, or seeking redress
for people tortured in detention, traffic analysis might show that the law
firm's email account is frequently corresponding with Human Rights Watch in New
York or Washington, or with Amnesty International in London.  The mere fact that
a given account has frequent correspondence with one of these two
internationally-known organizations is sufficient for an attacker to know that
the group is engaged in human rights work.   This group could then be defamed as
a pawn of the West, or subject to more direct repression.</P>
<P>Traffic analysis might be more subtle.  For example, if a group in China
sends electronic mail to Amnesty International, and Amnesty issues an urgent
action relevant to a person known by one of the account's users a day or two
later, someone watching the Chinese group's account and Amnesty International's
actions might reasonably conclude that the message from the group to Amnesty had
been the source of information for the urgent action.  Note that the attacker
would not need to know the contents of the Chinese group's message sent to
Amnesty to make this deduction.  If the attacker were the Chinese government,
the group in question might have serious problems: twenty- to thirty-year jail
terms for human rights dissidents have been common in the last year.</P>
<P>Finally, human rights or humanitarian groups in areas in conflict could be
destroyed by traffic analysis.  Imagine, for example, rape-survivor groups in
Bosnia trying to coordinate with counterparts in Croatia; or groups promoting
religious toleration in India and Pakistan.  In either example, evidence of the
communication itself -- regardless of the content of the communication -- could
be sufficient to mobilize popular animosity (for example, paramilitary violence
or lynch mobs) or state repression.</P>
<P>There is a method of anonymous electronic communication that eliminates the
risk of traffic analysis.  All of the problems can be avoided by introducing an
intermediary step or steps between the corresponding parties.  Each party sends
their electronic messages to an &quot;anonymous remailer,&quot; that is, to a
computer program that strips the originating header information from a message
and send it on to the next recipient.  The remailer breaks the connection
between the parties.  When a message arrives at its destination, it appears to
have originated at the remailer -- the sender's information has disappeared.  It
is as if the remailer has received a letter, opened it to find the real

recipient's address, resealed the letter in a new envelope with a new address,
and put it in the mail again.  When the letter arrives, it carries the
remailer's postmark, not the sender's.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of remailers: truly anonymous remailers, and
pseudonymous remailers(3).  A pseudonymous remailer(4) keeps a database of all
the addresses from which it has received one or more messages.  Pseudonymous
remailers are not secure.  If an attacker seized the database containing the
matches between the pseudonyms and the &quot;real&quot; addresses, then the
security of every user would be immediately compromised.  Human rights groups
should not use remailers of this kind.</P>
<P>True anonymous remailers are quite different(5).  These programs maintain no
database of addresses.  When messages are resent from a truly anonymous
remailer, the header information is set either to a deliberately misleading
address, or to randomly generated characters.  There is no record of the
connection between the sending address and the destination address.  For greater
security, many users program messages to pass through five to twenty remailers
before the message arrives at its final destination.  This technique, known as
chaining, assures greater security than sending through a single remailer.  Even
if some remailers keep secret records of their transactions, a single honest
remailing system will protect the user.  One disadvantage is that unless the
sender has identified herself in the body of the message, the recipient has no
way to reply to an anonymously sent message.</P>
<P>&quot;Anonymity&quot; in this sense I suggest here does not necessarily mean
concealing the identity of the sender from the legitimate recipient, although
these techniques can be used for that purpose.  The sender may have encrypted
and digitally signed the message before posting it to the remailer. Therefore
when the legitimate recipient decrypts the message, she can verify the digital
signature and thereby be assured that the message truly originated with the
person who purports to have sent it.  In human rights terms, the essential
feature of this system is that only the sender and the recipient know that they
are in communication with each other.  No one else can discover that their
conversation even exists, much less what the content of their conversation might
be.</P>
<P>In some cases, a source for human rights information might want to remain
totally anonymous.  A police officer revealing information about an abusive unit
might want to be protected from anyone at all knowing his identity; or the
citizen of a very repressive state might not want to risk being accidentally
betrayed by a well-meaning international human rights group.  Such users would
not affix digital signatures to their messages, or they would use signatures not
connected to their true identities.  These cases approximate the well-known &quot;whistle-blower&quot;
argument in favor of totally anonymous communication.  In these cases, no one,
not even the legitimate recipient, would know the sender's true identity.</P>
<P>Although the examples I have used refer mostly to electronic communication
in other countries, the need for anonymous electronic communication is just as
great for U.S. citizens corresponding with human rights workers in other
countries. Indeed, all of these examples are quite closely linked specifically
to the State of Georgia.  In my experience, some of the most technically
advanced people in Amnesty USA are located at Georgia Tech.  The Carter Center
in Atlanta is one of the world's largest human rights and humanitarian
organizations.  It is certain that a large quantity of human rights-related
electronic communication is originating or arriving in Georgia.  Given my
argument above, therefore, a great deal of anonymous electronic communication
is, or should be, originating or arriving in Georgia.  If we are to enable
people to monitor violations of internationally recognized human rights, we must
allow people associated with the Carter Center, and other U.S. citizens, to be
able to communicate anonymously in cyberspace.</P>
<P>I, Patrick Ball, declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true
and correct.</P>

<P>(1) Although the unlicensed export of strong cryptography from the United

States is illegal, human rights groups can very easily find free cryptographic
software on non-U.S. sites on the Internet, as well as from foreign commercial
vendors.</P>
<P>(2) Such systems would include i) Internet mail clients using the POP or
IMAP protocols, such as Eudora, Pegasus, etc.; ii) proprietary mail systems,
such as WinCIM for Compuserve, or AOL; or iii) FidoNet applications such as
FrontDoor or Marimba.  Note that FidoNet systems are commonly used in Africa.</P>
<P>(3) one discussion of remailers, by Andre Bacard, is found at

references to a wide variety of increasingly technical discussions of how
remailers work.</P>
<P>(4) Johan Helsingus' anon.penet.fi was -- before Helsingus discontinued it
-- the foremost example of a pseudonymous remailer.</P>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Global Alert: Hysteria in the UK Threatens Free Speech on

</H1>
<P>		*** GLOBAL ACTION ALERT ***
</P>
<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -  Please redistribute this document widely with this
banner intact -  Redistribute only in appropriate places &amp; only until 30
September 1996</P>
<P>The Sunday, August 25 issue of the London Observer splashed across its front
page a sensationalized account of child pornography on the Internet, falsely
accusing two Internet Service Providers, Clive Feather of Demon UK (a full
service site) and Johan Helsingius of anon.penet.fi (an anonymous remailer) of

involvement in the distribution of child pornography.  Why were these
accusations made? Demon UK had refused to remove a broad range of
sexually-oriented newsgroups identified by UK authorities as  possible sources
of child pornography, and anon.penet.fi was identified without substantiation as
a source for `90% of child pornography on the Internet.' </P>
<P>In fact, Demon UK was simply acknowledging that Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) cannot police the data that traverses their systems, nor assume
responsibility for it, any more than the post office can assume responsiblity
for content that is sent through traditional mail.  And Helsingius, contrary to
allegations in the London Observer, had long before restricted the size of files
that could be transferred through anon.penet.fi, effectively eliminating the
possibility that binary files containing pictures could be exchanged.</P>
<P>This story was extreme, but not without precedent: much has been written
associating the Internet with those who make and distribute child porn, and
there have been many attempts to hold ISPs responsible for objectionable or 
illegal content.
</P>
<P>ISPs are not content providers; they channel content provided by their
users.  It is outside the scope of the ISP to monitor, evaluate, and attempt to
remove objectionable content. In fact, any attempt by an ISP to block particular
 kinds of content will ultimately be fruitless, as providers of that content
will simply find alternate channels of distribution.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is wrong to assume that the Internet has no rules, and is
friendly to the exchange of objectionable materials.  In fact the Internet is a
`virtual community' of users with a distinct culture incorporating  diverse
views but finding consensus in opposition to censorship and access control. 
There is also strong opposition to the exploitation of children; in fact, many
Internet users have cooperated in attempts to identify those who create and
distribute child pornography.
</P>
<P>Summary: the physical abuse and exploitation of children is a very real
problem demanding a proactive response, however we vigorously oppose attempts to
 stifle the free and open exchange of information over the Internet in the
mistaken belief that overbroad restrictions on the flow of  information will
protect children from abuse.  We support Demon UK and anon.penet.fi (which
Helsingius has shut down), and deplore the Observer's lurid attempt to make
respectable Internet providers the &quot;cause&quot; of a problem for which 
they have no responsibility.
</P>
<P>The Observer story is not the first of its kind: it represents an ongoing 
confusion about a complex new medium.  Unfortunately this  misunderstanding has
become a global problem, represented in proposed or  enacted restrictive
legislation as well as negative press.
</P>
<DL>
<DT>Consider these possible analogies to the Internet:</DT>
<DD>--  The Internet is a vast mail system, like a post office.  Would you
favor a law that required postal authorities to open each piece of mail and
evaluate its acceptability?</DD>
<DD>--  The Internet is a huge library system.  Would you favor a law that
would restrict information a library can provide?</DD>
<DD>-- The Internet is a collection of virtual communities. Would you favor a
law that required routine searches of your community?
</DD></DL>
<P>Our position: These measures constrain everyone because of the misdeeds of a
few. It is more sensible to find and deal with the sources of child pornography
than to impede the flow of data over the Internet. The imposition of censorship
and additional constraints applied to ISPs will not solve the existing problem,
but will create a new problem, a barrier to the free and democratic exchange of
ideas.

			<LI>
			The definition of "computer networks" applicable to the Act is set forth in O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-92(2  and includes any set of remotely connected computers over which communications can take place. At a minimum, the content of communications over all of the following types of computer networks are affected by the Act. 
			<B>
				<U>
					The Global Internet
				</U>
				<P>
			</B>
			<LI>
			The largest computer network affected by the Act is the Internet, which is the largest online network in the world. It links a large number of smaller networks set up by universities, industry, nonprofit organizations, governments, and individuals. While estimates can only be approximations due to rapid growth, the Internet is believed to connect at least 59,000 computer networks, 2.2 million computers, 159 countries, and 40 million users. By some estimates, there will be as many as 200 million Internet users by the year 1999.
			<P>
			<LI>
			No one owns the Internet. It is a decentralized global medium of communication and expression in which governments, universities, institutions, corporations, and millions of ordinary people can communicate with each other, express opinions, share ideas, educate themselves, and seek, exchange or publish information on every imaginable topic either to specific recipients or to the entire world almost instantaneously and at minimal cost.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Virtually anyone can now use the Internet to communicate with other online users. Anyone with a personal computer, modem, and telephone line can obtain access to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider ("ISP" , usually for a fee. Many businesses, universities, and other institutions have computer networks that are directly connected to the Internet, and give their employees, faculty, students, etc., free or low-cost Internet access accounts. For those without a computer or access through work or school, many communities have established "free nets" or community networks to provide their citizens with a local link to the Internet. Many public libraries offer similar access. There are also a growing number of "cyberspace cafes," coffee shops where customers, for a small hourly fee, can use computers provided by the shop to access the Internet.
			<P>
			<LI>
			The Internet is designed to reroute communications rapidly through the network if one or more individual links in the network are unavailable. This means that any data sent over the Internet can travel any number of different paths to get from its origin to its destination. Persons transmitting information over this international computer network have no control over the route their messages take. Any data transmitted over the Internet could potentially travel through the wires or airspace of Georgia. 
			<P>
			<LI>
			There are hundreds of thousands of Internet users in the State of Georgia, all of whom can communicate with or receive information from any other user on the network anywhere in the world.

			These services enable their customers to communicate with other customers, access the Internet, and access other proprietary information and services available only to subscribers. There are more than twelve million subscribers to major commercial online services in the United States and overseas; each of these services have customers in Georgia, who use the services to communicate with others throughout the United States (and in some cases, the world .

With a relatively small investment, anyone with a phone line, computer, modem, and proper software, can establish a BBS to allow friends, neighbors, customers, or members of the general public to dial in and communicate with each other on topics of common interest. There are several hundred such BBSs in Georgia, operated by individuals, nonprofit organizations, advocacy groups, and as businesses. In addition, there are thousands of additional local BBSs in other states, which can be reached from Georgia over long distance telephone lines or through a network of BBS systems known as FIDONET, which allows BBS subscribers to communicate with subscribers to other BBSs in Georgia and throughout the country.

			E-mail is the basic method of communication over computer networks. It allows one user to send a message to any other user or users on the network.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Because mass mailings via e-mail are relatively easy and inexpensive, e-mail enables any user to publish and distribute information on any topic simply by compiling a mailing list of online users and sending the newsletter to everyone. For example, plaintiff Ken Leebow distributes a weekly Internet newsletter under the pen name "Norman" to more than 13,000 subscribers around the world.

				Discussion & Chat Groups

			One of the most popular forms of communication over computer networks are "discussion groups." Discussion groups allow users of computer networks to post messages onto a public computerized bulletin board or to an automated electronic mailing list of subscribers, and to read and respond to messages posted by others participating in the discussion group. Discussion groups have been organized on many different computer networks and on virtually every topic imaginable. Discussion groups can be formed by individuals, institutions or organizations, or by particular computer networks.
			<P>
			<LI>
			"USENET" newsgroups are a very popular set of bulletin board discussion groups available on the Internet and other networks. There are currently USENET newsgroups on more than 15,000 different subjects, and over 100,000 new messages are posted to these groups each day. In addition, there are many thousands more Internet discussion groups organized through automated mailing lists to subscribers. There are still thousands more organized on the various commercial online services and on local BBSs. All or virtually all of these discussion groups are accessible by computer users in Georgia. 
			<P>
			<LI>
			Similar to discussion groups are "chat groups," which allow users to engage in simultaneous conversations with each other by typing messages and reading the messages typed by others participating in the "chat." Chat groups occur over the Internet, commercial online services, and local BBSs. These groups are often set up by particular organizations or online services, but any individual user can form an online "chat." Some chat groups are organized for social entertainment, and others are organized by a particular sponsor on a particular topics to provide a specific forum for discussion of issues or ideas.
			<P>

			Online discussion and chat groups create an entirely new public forum -- analogous to the village green -- in which individuals can associate and communicate with others who have common interests, and engage in discussion or debate on every imaginable topic.

			A third major category of communication on computer networks involves the publication and retrieval of information. Computer networks, and especially the Internet, give individuals of ordinary means a remarkable new power to publish ideas, opinions, poetry, stories, images, video, and sound to the world. This information can then be retrieved by anyone in the world who has access to the network.
			<P>
			<LI>
			The "World Wide Web" (Web  is the most popular way to publish and retrieve information on the Internet. Anyone with access to the Internet and proper software can publish "web pages," which may contain text, images, sound and even video. The Web is comprised of millions of separate "web sites" that provide content provided by a particular person or organization, and each web site may include one or more different web pages published by the author of the site. Any Internet user anywhere in the world can view the web pages published by others, read their text, look at their images and video, and listen to their sounds.
			<P>
			<LI>
			The Web was created to serve as the platform for a global, online store of knowledge, containing information from a diversity of sources, and accessible to Internet users around the world. Though information on the Web is contained in individual computers, the fact that each of these computers is connected to the Internet through Web protocols allows all of the information to become part of a single body of knowledge. It is currently the most advanced information system on the Internet.

				The Importance of Links on the World Wide Web:

		<P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			The Web also provide web authors with the unique ability to "link" different web pages on the Internet together. These "links" can be text or images in a web page that, when selected by the reader, automatically transfer the reader to a different location on the Internet. For example, a particular link might transport the reader to a different part of the same web page or to an entirely different web page stored in an entirely different computer anywhere in the world.
			<P>
			<LI>
			The author of any web page can create a "link" that points to any other web page published on the Internet, without having to contact the creator of the document. Many of the plaintiffs publish such links in their web pages. Plaintiffs Ken Leebow and Bonnie Nadri, for example, provide hundreds of different links to other web pages on the Internet that they find to be helpful or of interest. Plaintiff Mitchell Kaye provides extensive links to politics-related and similar web sites. Plaintiff Josh Riley provides links to religious web sites, baseball-related sites, and sites with local information that will assist new residents moving to the Atlanta area. Plaintiffs ACLU of Georgia, EFF, and EFGA all provide extensive links to web sites with information on online privacy, civil liberties, online access, and similar issues. 
			<P>
			<LI>
			Many pages on the Web are published by corporations or organizations that operate under trade names. Links to those web pages are routinely identified by the trade name of the organization or some other logo or trademark that readily identifies the company or organization to whose web page the link is directed. For example, plaintiff EFGA includes in its web page a news advisory and commentary relating to a recent tariff increase for ISDN data telecommunications lines proposed by BellSouth. EFGA's news advisory encourages readers to express their views to BellSouth regarding the proposed increase, and reproduces a copy of the BellSouth logo which, when clicked by the user, will transport the user to BellSouth's own web page for providing customer feedback to the company via e-mail.
			<P>
			<LI>
			"Search engines" and "directories" on the Web are services that collect and organize millions of different links to web pages. "Search engines," such as Yahoo, Alta Vista, and Webcrawler, allow users to search the entire World Wide Web for particular words or phrases. The search engine then provides a list of web pages that contain the search term, and allows the user to "link" to the web page of their choice. "Directories" are large databases of web sites arranged according to subject matter, similar to an online card catalog. Directories provide "links" to relevant web sites on particular subjects.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Without these search engines and directories, it would be much more difficult for Internet users to locate and retrieve information of interest on the Web. Thus, these search engines and directories provide an essential service to all Internet users. They routinely provide many "links" to web pages using the trade names or logos of the companies or organizations to whom they are linking.
			<P>
			<LI>
			The critical linking feature is the defining characteristic of the Web. The Web is comprised of all web pages in the world, stored in millions of different computers around the globe. The Web is the interlocking system of links created by individual users in each individual page. Linking is

			WHY PEOPLE COMMUNICATE ANONYMOUSLY IN CYBERSPACE
		</B>
		<P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			For many of the same reasons that people have historically communicated anonymously through other media like print and the telephone, online users frequently communicate anonymously or pseudonymously in cyberspace. 
			<P>
			<LI>
			Anonymity allows online users to voice unpopular ideas without fear of retaliation. Citizens can engage in political speech without identifying themselves to the party in power. Victims of crime or disease can request help and advice without stigma.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Anonymity also eliminates the potential for discrimination and harassment according to factors like gender and ethnicity. Many women communicate online under gender-neutral pseudonyms to avoid harassing e-mail. This practice is similar to women who list their phone number under their first initial in order to avoid harassing calls. Similarly, online users may wish to use pseudonyms in order to avoid discrimination or harassment based on names associated with particular ethnic groups.
			<B>
				<P>
			</B>
			<LI>
			Anonymity also helps online users maintain their privacy. People communicating about unpopular or sensitive issues might suffer unwanted invasions of privacy, both online and offline, if others had access to their real identity. Anonymity also allows famous people to communicate online as "average people," without fear of a privacy invasion.
			<B>
				<P>
			</B>
			<LI>
			In some cases, anonymity is a necessary security measure. The personal safety of human rights dissidents, domestic abuse victims, and whistle-blowers would be compromised if they could not communicate anonymously.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Anonymity also assists users in preventing the collection and potential misuse by third parties of personal information about them. Online communications can be easily tracked, downloaded and stored by anyone; anonymity can prevent unauthorized third parties from tying that information to a particular person.
			<P>
			<LI>
			In addition to the advantages of speaking anonymously in cyberspace, online users have many reasons for wanting to 
			<I>
				access
			</I>
			online information anonymously. Many users would be inhibited from accessing controversial, embarrassing, or sensitive information if they first had to reveal their identity. Political information, safe sex information, and information on stigmatizing diseases are just a few examples of content that some users might wish to access anonymously. In addition, because most web sites collect information about visitors, many online users fear that using their real identity would threaten their privacy whenever they access the Web.

			Many Internet Service Providers, commercial online services, and local BBSs, allow users to set up pseudonymous accounts, permitting the user to communicate online using a "screen name," "user name," or "handle" that is a pen name rather than the real name of the account holder. When a user sends e mail, publishes newsletters, or participates in discussions or chat groups using this screen name, the message sent is identified as coming from the screen name adopted by the sender. Many service providers allow their users to set up multiple "screen names" or "user names." This feature allows users to use different names for different purposes. For example, a user might use her real name as a "screen name" when communicating by e-mail with someone they know personally, but use a pen name as a "screen name" when communicating with strangers.

To provide additional privacy, some Internet Service Providers and local BBS operators offer anonymous accounts. That is, they do not require any identification in order to set up an account for communicating over the network. These accounts provide additional privacy and security to the user because even the service provider has no way to identify the true identity of the user.

				Anonymous and Pseudonymous Remailers

		<P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			In addition to the use of screen names or anonymous access accounts, there are special services that allow online users who normally communicate online under their real name to send particular messages anonymously or pseudonymously over the Internet. These services are known as pseudonymous and anonymous remailers, and are software programs that run on computers connected to the Internet. When an online user sends e-mail to the remailer address, the remailer strips the identifying information from the message and then forwards the mail to its destination. The recipient receives mail that has no evidence indicating its point of origin. Remailers can be used to send individual e-mail, and to post messages to mailing lists or USENET newsgroups.
			<P>
			<LI>
			"Pseudonymous remailers" are remailers that set up accounts for repeated use. The operator of a pseudonymous remailer knows the account holder's real e-mail address, but provides the account holder with a secret numeric identifier that is used whenever the account holder sends a message through the remailer. Other anonymous users, each with their own secret numeric identifier, can then reply to the anonymous message. This allows users to create a double-blind situation where two or more users can have an ongoing exchange without ever knowing the identity of the other users. Plaintiff Community ConneXion maintains a popular pseudonymous remailer known as the "alpha.c2.org" remailer, which any Internet user can use free of charge.
			<P>
			<LI>
			In contrast, 
			<I>
				anonymous 
			</I>
			remailers are primarily for one time usage, do not provide a means to reply to the sender through a secret identifier, and thus provide additional anonymity and privacy. Any Internet user can use an anonymous remailer simply by sending a particular e-mail message to the remailer, which will forward the message anonymously to its final destination.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Currently, there are over twenty public remailers that any online user may use free of charge. Plaintiff Community ConneXion provides a service that allows users to use the World Wide Web to send messages through a series of anonymous remailers available on the Internet. Plaintiff EFF provides links to some of these remailers from its web site on the Internet, and plaintiff EFGA has current plans to establish its own anonymous remailer at its Internet domain in Georgia.
			<P>
			<LI>
			To prevent abuse of such remailers, there are programs available to the public, known as "kill files" and "bozo filters," that provide online users with the means to screen out anonymous messages if they desire. These programs reduce the likelihood of harm from misuse of anonymous remailers.

			For additional anonymity, as in the case of e-mail accounts discussed above, some Internet Service Providers also allow persons and organizations to set up and maintain web pages anonymously. For example, prior to the passage of the Act at issue in this case, plaintiff The Atlanta Freethought Society had planned to open an anonymous account to publish that Society's web page due to concern about threats and harassment that might arise as a result of the controversial nature of the issues the Society planned to discuss on its page. Plaintiff Community ConneXion also provides subscribers with the option to publish anonymous web pages.

As a general rule, however, obtaining information anonymously over the Internet is difficult because every time an online user visits a web site, she leaves a digital "calling card" that reveals the address of the computer from which she is linked to the Internet, the address of the web site she last visited, the kind of computer she is using, and other details. Many web sites keep logs with this information on all of the visitors that access their site.

			<P>
			<LI>
			To assist online users in protecting their privacy, there are now services that allow online users to access information anonymously on the Internet. These services, called "anonymizers," serve as a middleman between the user and the particular pages he wants to retrieve. The Anonymizer strips all references to the user's e-mail address, computer type, and previous page visited before downloading the web page to the user. If the user follows a link from a page accessed through the Anonymizer, the linked page is also accessed anonymously. Plaintiff Community ConneXion provides an Anonymizer service to the online public free of charge.

The site provides electronic copies of ACLU publications, reports, court briefs and decisions, news releases, announcements and other materials related to the ACLU's legal, legislative, educational and advocacy work.

			The ACLU of Georgia has been involved with a number of sensitive issues and topics such as censorship, separation of Church and State, reproductive freedom, AIDS issues, Gay and Lesbian rights and privacy issues. Because of the sensitive nature of these issues, many of which are addressed on the web site, the ACLU believes that online users should be able to access its web site anonymously or using a pseudonym. Those who currently access the ACLU web site anonymously will likely refrain from doing so in the future because such anonymous correspondence on the Internet is made a crime under Georgia law.

			In addition, persons using pseudonyms often send comments, questions or opinions by e-mail to the ACLU of Georgia. For example, persons have sent very sensitive questions, comments and opinions about such issues as the death penalty, separation of Church and State and gay/lesbian rights. The ACLU believes that these persons should be allowed to use pseudonyms to protect their privacy.

			In spite of laws meant to protect the rights of those with HIV and AIDS, including one making HIV status confidential, people with AIDS continue to lose jobs, insurance, and even their homes as a result of social prejudices. To avoid discrimination and social stigma, many members of the AIDS Survival Project use pseudonyms when communicating or accessing information over the Internet.

			To better enable its members to take advantage of the information available on the Internet, the AIDS Survival Project is currently developing a web page to serve as a conduit by providing links to other organizations' web pages. As a small non-profit, it would be impossible to provide useful information to its members without using links to other related web pages.

			As a result of the Act's prohibition against using trade names, trademarks, logos, or legal or official seals without permission, the AIDS survival project feels its web page, composed of links to other organizations' web pages, may be in conflict with the law.

For example, Community ConneXion makes available a pseudonymous remailer that allows Internet users who normally communicate under their real name to send particular messages pseudonymously. Community ConneXion also operates a service that allows any Internet user to use the World Wide Web to send messages through a series of anonymous remailers (known as the "remailer network"  available on the Internet.

EFF also provides links on its web page to "anonymous remailers." EFF believes that online users should be able to access its computer sites anonymously or pseudonymously. EFF believes that pseudonymity and anonymity allows online users to participate in discussions without revealing their name to strangers, and without fear of retaliation for the expression of unpopular or controversial viewpoints. This protection of privacy furthers the public interest by facilitating freer and more frank discussions, especially on controversial issues.

Mr. Kaye does not know whether use of the pseudonym "Publius" violates the Act because it "falsely identifies" him.

Additionally, because it is impossible to determine what path a particular online communication travels, persons outside Georgia may be communicating "through" Georgia in order to communicate with him. He is fearful, therefore, that the threat of prosecution under the statute may chill the willingness of his sources to continue their online communications with him.
			<P>
			<LI>
			In addition, Mr. Mirken fears that his online screen name may subject him to prosecution under the Act. Although his AOL screen name, "Bmirk," is based on his real name, it does not identify him with specificity. He does not know whether using "Bmirk" as a screen name "falsely identifies" him within the meaning of the Act.

			Bonnie Nadri operates The Page Factory, a web page design business. She maintains a web site, "http://thepagefactory.org/," to advertise services and rates, and to solicit business for The Page Factory. Because the design, layout and look of the web page itself is an example of The Page Factory's web design abilities, the design and look of the page is particularly important for business.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Originally, The Page Factory web page published an extensive set of links to other related resources on the Web, including other web design resources, search engines, and links to the web pages of other Atlanta-area businesses. The Page Factory web page used many graphics for these links in order to demonstrate its web design services and the possibilities for design and layout of web pages. Many of these graphics were the logos or trademarks of the companies to whom the page was linked. For example, the Coca-Cola trademark logo provided a link to the web site of the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta. Ms. Nadri did not obtain the permission of these companies before establishing these links, and it would be impossible as a practical matter to obtain such permission for every link.
			<P>
			<LI>
			When Ms. Nadri learned about the passage of the Act, she became concerned that use of these logos and graphics to provide links from The Page Factory web page had become illegal. Because of this fear, Ms. Nadri removed the logos and graphics from The Page Factory web page, and changed the links to text based references. Ultimately, she decided to remove the links altogether, because the text-only links were drab and did not display very interesting web design skills. Removing these links, logos and images damaged her web design business because they limited her ability to demonstrate web design skills to potential customers. However, Ms. Nadri believes that reinstating the links would subject her to prosecution under the Act.
			<P>
			<LI>
			In addition to the business web page for The Page Factory, Ms. Nadri maintains a personal web page, which expresses her own personal interests and provides a number of links to other web pages that are of personal interest to her. This web page can be accessed at http://www.mindspring.com/~blnadri/. Unlike her business site, Ms. Nadri continues to publish text-based links on her personal web page, some of which use the trade names of companies or organizations to whom she is linking. She is concerned that even this limited use of trade names on her personal page may still subject her to prosecution under the Act.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Ms. Nadri also makes extensive use of the Internet and local Bulletin Board Services ("BBSs"  to communicate and interact with others in the online world. She particularly enjoys participating in chat and discussion groups on local BBSs in the Atlanta area, and over the Internet.
			<P>
			<LI>
			When participating in chat sessions or discussion groups on local BBSs, Ms. Nadri always uses a pseudonym or "handle." She is a single mother and lives alone with her daughter in the Atlanta area. She is very concerned about the risk of revealing her real name to strangers that may be participating in or simply monitoring the chat sessions or discussions, especially when she communicates on local BBSs. Anyone with a computer, modem and telephone can log into these services, and if she used her real name to participate in the chat sessions or discussion groups, anyone who has logged on would be able to find her address. She is concerned about the risk of another user stalking or harassing her or her daughter. For fear of harassment (or worse , she would not continue to participate in these chat sessions if she had to use her real name.

			Josh Riley is a corporate consultant and provides residential real estate brokerage services for a real estate brokerage company called Property Systems Real Estate in Atlanta. In connection with his real estate business, he operates a web site that can be accessed at http://www.mindspring.com/~relocate. He uses this site as a means of marketing his services as a real estate agent, providing information, for example, about property listings. His real estate web page includes an extensive list of "Other Links" to Atlanta and Georgia web sites that may be helpful to people planning to move to the Atlanta area, including cultural institutions in the Atlanta area, banks, churches, employment and business resources, and tourist information. Several of these links include the trade names of institutions or organizations.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Mr. Riley also operates two Internet "domains," or locations on the World Wide Web. The first of these is "www.worship.com," which houses several web sites that Mr. Riley has developed and maintained for churches and ministries in the Atlanta area, including a web page for the First Baptist Atlanta/North Campus and a web page for the North Point Community Church. The pages also include extensive links to related Christian ministry resources on the Internet, including organizations like Focus on the Family, the Christian Coalition, the Family Research Council, and Contemporary Christian Music Magazine.
			<P>
			<LI>
			The second domain Mr. Riley operates on the World Wide Web is "www.blackbaseball.com," which publishes a variety of information relating to the Negro Baseball Leagues that flourished in the early part of this century when African-Americans were barred from participating in the major leagues. This web page has been very popular and has won awards as an outstanding Internet resource on this topic. The page includes several links to other resources on the Negro Baseball Leagues and related baseball topics, including a page that uses the HBO (Home Box Office  logo to urge viewers to look for the movie "Soul of the Game."
			<P>
			<LI>
			Mr. Riley has not requested permission to use trade names to provide links on his web sites, and it would be impossible as a practical matter to do so for all of the links.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Mr. Riley also has membership accounts with America Online and Prodigy. He uses several "screen names" or "handles" with these accounts that are pseudonyms. Mr. Riley prefers to use a pseudonym when contributing comments to online chats and discussion groups about real estate and politics because he is concerned about receiving offensive messages from other users of the service who may disagree with views that he expresses in this medium. In addition, using a pseudonym prevents people from determining his real identity and delivering offensive messages to him in person or over the telephone.

As a public service, he also maintains a site on the World Wide Web known as the Safer Sex Page, which can be accessed free of charge at http://www.safersex.org. The Safer Sex Page is composed of two separate components: the information pages and the Safer Sex Forum.
			<P>
			<LI>
			The information pages include brochures about safer sex, HIV transmission, and condoms, as well as resources for health educators and counselors. In this age of AIDS, Mr. Troyer believes the Safer Sex Page can help save lives by providing information about safer sex practices. The Safer Sex Page also provides information helpful in avoiding other sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancy.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Mr. Troyer believes that online users, especially teenagers, should be able to access the Safer Sex Page anonymously or using pseudonyms. If young people could not use pseudonyms in order to access the site, many of them would choose not to enter at all for fear of disclosure. With the rate of HIV transmission among teenagers increasing over the years, the consequences of denying them such information could very well cost lives.
			<P>
			<LI>
			The Safer Sex Page provides a number of links to other safer sex resources available on the World Wide Web, including links to Planned Parenthood, the Center for Disease Control, Condom Club International and the Rainbow Mall. Some of these links may include trade names, registered trademarks, logos, etc. Mr. Troyer has not received explicit permission to establish these links and it would be practically impossible for him to do so.
			<P>
			<LI>
			In addition to maintaining the Safer Sex Web page, Mr. Troyer moderates the Safer Sex Forum, an online discussion group in which any Internet user can participate. Past topics have included condom brands, how to talk about safer sex with a sex partner, and masturbation. Because of the explicit and sensitive nature of the topics, a number of participants in these discussions use pseudonyms or post anonymously in order to protect their privacy. Mr. Troyer believes that many people would not feel comfortable discussing such issues if they could not use pseudonyms. If all participants in the Safer Sex Forum were forced to disclose their true identity, the quantity and the quality of the discussion would suffer.

			<LI>
			Jonathan Wallace is a software business executive and attorney based in New York City. He uses the Internet extensively to communicate and access information on both personal and business matters. Mr. Wallace has two "user names" that he uses when communicating online. One is his real name, Jonathan Wallace, and the other is a pseudonym, Jonathan Blumen.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Mr. Wallace began using the pseudonym Jonathan Blumen in January, 1995, in connection with The Ethical Spectacle, a monthly newsletter that he publishes on the World Wide Web. In The Ethical Spectacle, Mr. Wallace expresses political and ethical views which are sometimes of a controversial nature. Since he sometimes writes and lectures for the New York-based software company by which he is employed, he adopted the Jonathan Blumen pseudonym in order to keep his business "persona" and personal beliefs separate. In particular, he wanted to be able to express his views without his employer being held responsible for them. For example, he wrote an essay in The Ethical Spectacle on the antitrust case against Microsoft, a case about which his employer could not safely take a position without endangering certain business relationships. Mr. Wallace also uses the pseudonym Jonathan Blumen to communicate on Internet mailing lists and discussion groups on topics such as freedom of speech, constitutional liberty in America, cryptography and anonymity, and threats to the environment.
			<P>
			<LI>
			The Ethical Spectacle, which can be accessed at http://www.spectacle.org, began in January 1995. Each issue of The Ethical Spectacle is approximately 20-30 pages. Mr. Wallace receives no payment for maintaining the newsletter. The purpose of The Ethical Spectacle is to address issues at the intersection of ethics, law, and politics in American life. The material in the newsletter is meant to provoke thought about these important issues. Some issues of The Ethical Spectacle are dedicated to particular subjects, including the meaning of government, freedom of speech, ethics and science fiction, pornography, and Nazi concentration camps.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Mr. Wallace accepts e-mail submissions for publication in The Ethical Spectacle, and occasionally publishes anonymous and pseudonymous submissions. For example, "Bob Wilson" has written several articles that take extremely conservative positions on issues such as welfare and gun control. Bob is a businessman in a Western state who does not care to use his real name when expressing his views. Another article, entitled "Mike Tyson is a Rapist, Not a Hero", which appeared under the byline Lisa G., was submitted by a woman who requested that her name not appear. Mr. Wallace has also received and published mail in The Ethical Spectacle that was sent through anonymous remailers. One letter was from a German who read an article in The Ethical Spectacle about Auschwitz, and was very affected by it but was still struggling with the issue of whether to believe the Holocaust occurred. This troubled individual wrote anonymously because he wanted to confess his emotional struggle without revealing his real name.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Mr. Wallace does not know whether publishing articles by anonymous or pseudonymous authors in The Ethical Spectacle violates the Act because it constitutes "transmit[ting] data through a computer network . . . if such data uses any individual name . . . to falsely identify the person." Because the meaning of the Act is unclear, he is forced to choose between rejecting anonymous submissions or risking prosecution under the Act.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Mr. Wallace also believes it is important for readers of The Ethical Spectacle to be able to access the web site anonymously or pseudonymously. Because it contains controversial material, or because they do not want their identity to be recorded by particular web sites, some readers might be inhibited from accessing the site if they could not do so pseudonymously.
			<P>
			<LI>
			The Ethical Spectacle currently provides links to other relevant online material. For instance, there are links to the web sites of Yahoo (a popular Internet search engine , Wired Magazine, United Church of Christ, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC , Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR , the American Civil Liberties Union, and Greenpeace. Some of these links may include trade names, registered trademarks, logos, legal or official seals, or copyrighted symbols. These links provide valuable references to information that may be of interest to readers of the web site.

			<LI>
			Because of the nature of online communications, plaintiffs, their members, users, and subscribers have no way to determine whether a particular communication travels through the State of Georgia and therefore may be subject to the Act. There is no way to determine the geographic location of persons who read and reply to their postings to online newsgroups, mailing lists, and chat rooms, or who download information from web sites. Most of these fora can be accessed by anyone in the world, and there is no way to ensure that no one from Georgia will view the messages. Thus, all online communications are subject to the Act.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Plaintiffs do not intend to deceive anyone by communicating pseudonymously or anonymously, or by providing links in their web sites to other sites with trade names, trademarks, or logos.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Plaintiffs do not know whether they, or their members, users, or subscribers, could be prosecuted for communicating and accessing information online under a pseudonym or anonymously because such communication constitutes the "transmi[ssion of] data through a computer network . . . [and] such data uses any individual name . . . to falsely identify the person." Because the meaning of the Act is unclear, plaintiffs, their members, users, and subscribers will be forced to choose between abandoning anonymity or risking prosecution under the Act.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Plaintiffs do not know whether they could be prosecuted under the Act for their use in web publications of the trade names, logos, etc., of other companies or organizations -- particularly, their use of these names or logos to provide links to other web sites -- because it constitutes "transmit[ting] data through a computer network . . . us[ing] any . . . trade name, registered trademark, logo, legal or official seal, or copyrighted symbol to falsely . . . imply . . . permission or legal[] authoriz[ation] to use such trade name, registered trademark, logo, legal or official seal, or copyrighted symbol." Because some of the plaintiffs' uses of these names or logos are in the context of critical news or commentary (such as the use of the BellSouth logo by EFGA, or Mitchell Kaye's use of the Georgia seal , and because of the large number of links in many of the other plaintiffs' web sites, it would be impossible as a practical matter for plaintiffs to obtain this permission. Because the meaning of the Act is unclear, plaintiffs will be forced to choose between removing the links, which would significantly decrease the value and usefulness of their web sites, or risking prosecution under the Act.

		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			The Act never defines the phrase "point of access to electronic information." The phrase is exceedingly vague, and broad enough that it could reasonably be construed to include not only any computer, but also fax machines, telephone answering machines, voicemail systems, ham or citizen band radios, magnetic tapes and tape recorders, and a whole host of other similar devices. For example, an ordinary voice telephone can certainly provide a "point of access to electronic information," and "data" as defined in the Act is broad enough to include voice data transmitted over local telephone lines.
			<P>
			<LI>
			Thus, in addition to the communications over computer networks described above, the Act could be construed to criminalize any communications using pseudonyms or assumed names in many other contexts such as, for example, communications over local private computer Local Area Networks ("LANs" , private telephone conversations, fax communications, communications to a telephone answering machine or voice mailbox, and so forth. As in the case of communications over computer networks, this broad sweep would prohibit a wide array of protected expression and would violate the Constitution for all the same reasons discussed above.

			<P>
			RE: Computer Use Policy
			</P>
			<P>
			Dear President Shapiro:
			</P>
			<P>
			In response to complaints we have received from members of the Princeton University community, we write on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ) to urge you to reconsider the policy prohibiting members of the University from using the Princeton's computer network for &quot;political purposes.&quot; We believe that the policy is based on a misunderstanding of the law regarding the University's tax-exempt status, and restricts free speech and academic freedom rights guaranteed by Art. I, par. 6 of the New Jersey Constitution.
			</P>
			<P>
			Princeton University's decision to offer its faculty, staff and students widespread access to the University's computer network and the Internet greatly expanded the resources available for academic research. It also provided a new and exciting forum for the free communication of ideas. In contrast, Princeton's decision to prohibit the use of the network for &quot;political purposes&quot; unjustifiably interferes with the right of the University community to exchange ideas freely, regardless of their content.
			</P>
			<P>
			Princeton's current computer use policy holds that &quot;the Computing and network resources of the University may not be used by members of the University community for commercial or political purposes or for financial gain . . . .&quot; Trustees of Princeton University, Rights, Rules, Responsibilities 11 (1993) (emphasis added) (hereinafter &quot;Rights,&quot; attached as Appendix A). On July 19, 1996, the Office of the General Counsel sent an e-mail to members of the University community warning them that any use of the Internet or computer network for &quot;any participation in, or intervention in, (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office&quot; would result in disciplinary action. See Office of the General Counsel, &quot;Internet use and Politics,&quot; E-mail of July 19, 1996, attached as Appendix B.
			</P>
			<P>
			We understand that the rationale behind the computer use policy is a concern that the University will lose its tax-exempt status, under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), if it allows members of the University community to use the computer network for political purposes. We believe that this concern is misplaced, based on the policies and rulings of the Internal Revenue Service.
			</P>
			<P>
			Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) provides that an educational organization will be tax-exempt as long as it &quot;does not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.&quot; The Internal Revenue Service has clarified that in order to constitute participation or intervention in a political campaign, the political activity must be that of the University itself and not the individual activity of its faculty, staff, or students. See Internal Revenue Service, Exempt Organizations Technical Institution Program for 1993 426-27 (1993), attached as Appendix C. Thus, any personal communication by University members over the computer network cannot threaten Princeton's tax-exempt status.
			</P>
			<P>
			The fact that Princeton provides the computing facilities over which the communication takes place does not change this conclusion. The Internal Revenue Service has stated that a principal factor in determining whether the provision of university facilities to a group engaged in political activities will constitute participation in a political campaign by the university under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), is whether the facilities are provided on an equal basis to groups using them for non-political reasons. Id. at 427. Princeton provides fair and equal access to the computer network, including e-mail and World Wide Web access, to all University members, and allows use of the network for a variety of non-political purposes. See Rights at 11. Thus, political speech over the network will not jeopardize Princeton's tax-exempt status.
			</P>
			<P>
			Even use of the computer network for political purposes in connection with a particular course would not jeopardize Princeton's 501(c)(3) status. The Internal Revenue Service has previously held that a university that required its students in a certain political science course to participate in a political campaign of the student's choice for 60 to 80 hours during the semester was not participating in political campaigns within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3). See Revenue Ruling 75-512, 1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix D.
			</P>
			<P>
			In addition, student organizations are able to publish political views on the computer network without threatening Princeton's tax-exempt status. The Internal Revenue Service has held that a university was not participating in a political campaign within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), when statements made in support of political candidates appeared on the editorial page of a student newspaper. This was true despite the university's provision of financial support and facilities to the newspaper, as long as the views expressed in the newspaper were clearly those of the students and not of the university itself. See Revenue Ruling 75-513, 1972-2 C.B. 246, attached as Appendix E.
			</P>
			<P>
			Accordingly, Princeton University does not risk its tax-exempt status by allowing University members to use its computer network for political purposes. We recognize that Princeton has a legitimate interest in ensuring that the individual views of its members not be mistaken for official positions of the University. At most, the only permissible regulation that Princeton might desire is one requiring a member of the University community, who uses Princeton's name in a way that could lead a reasonable person to interpret the author's statement as an official position of the University, to include a disclaimer clarifying that the opinions expressed over the computer network are those of the author alone. Compare Rights, &quot;Guidelines Relating to the Tax-Exempt Status of the University and Political Activities,&quot; at Section 3.
			</P>
			<P>
			Because there exists no legitimate reason for Princeton's blanket prohibition of political speech over the computer network, it is an unjustified, content-based restriction on the free expression rights of students, faculty and staff. Therefore, the policy is not only unworthy of a great University like Princeton, it is in violation of Art. I, par. 6 of the New Jersey Constitution.
			</P>
			<P>
			Although Princeton University is not a state university, the New Jersey Supreme Court has held the Princeton University campus to have been sufficiently devoted to expressive uses so as to require the University to honor the State constitutional guarantee of free expression. 
			</P>
			<P>
			See State v. Schmid, 84 N.J. 535, 564-65 (1980); see also New Jersey Coalition Against the War in the Middle East v. J.M.B. Realty Corp., 138 N.J. 326 (1994) (holding that regional shopping malls were sufficiently open to expressive use so as to extend state constitutional right to leaflet). Princeton's computer facilities are as much a part of the Princeton &quot;campus&quot; as are the lawns and buildings. Princeton may not constitutionally restrict its students, faculty, and staff from engaging in political speech over the Internet any more than it could prohibit them from engaging in such speech in the dorm rooms, classrooms, halls, lawns, and offices of the campus.
			</P>
			<P>
			Political expression has always received the highest degree of constitutional protection. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 14 (1976). The Constitution was written with the intention to protect from censorship those who wish to express their political beliefs and their support for political candidates. Indeed, &quot;where political speech is involved, our tradition insists that government `allow the widest room for discussion, the narrowest range for restriction.'&quot; State v. Miller, 83 N.J. 402, 412 (1980). As a school with a well-deserved reputation as a leader in American higher education, Princeton should be the first to promote and defend academic freedom and freedom of expression within its community, to the very limits of the law.
			</P>
			<P>
			The computer use policy, read literally, also infringes upon the free speech rights of Princeton faculty, staff, and students to receive information. Lamont v.

Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479-482-83 (1965) (&quot;right of freedom of speech . . . includes not only the right to utter or print, but the right to . . . receive, the right to read . . . and freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, and freedom to teach . . . .

This is because the University's computer facilities, although located on the Princeton campus, are a gateway to a virtual, worldwide community. See ACLU v. Reno, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7919 (E.D. Pa., June 11, 1996). They provide a unique means for students, faculty, and staff to access information on virtually any topic, including politics.

				Princeton recognizes that the central purposes of a University are the pursuit of truth, the discovery of new knowledge through scholarship and research, the teaching and general development of students, and the transmission of knowledge and learning to society at large. Free inquiry and free expression within the academic community are indispensable to the achievement of these goals. The freedom to teach and to learn depends upon the creation of appropriate conditions and opportunities on the campus as a whole as well as in classrooms and lecture halls.

				With respect to political speech, the University also recognizes that it has a fundamental responsibility to ensure the opportunity for all members of the University community to exercise their prerogatives as citizens. . . . Encouragement of an interest in public affairs and the furthering of a sense of social responsibility have long been considered important elements of a liberal education. The University continues to consider self-chosen participation in political and social action by individuals and groups to be a valuable part of the educational experience it seeks to encourage. Such activities on the part of individuals or groups do not, and should not be taken to, imply commitment of the University to any partisan political position or point of view.

<P>August 23, 1996</P>
<P>BY FACSIMILE, E-MAIL, &amp; REGULAR MAIL</P>
<ADDRESS>Howard S. Ende</ADDRESS>
<ADDRESS>Office of General Counsel  </ADDRESS>
<ADDRESS>120 Alexander Street, 2nd Floor</ADDRESS>
<ADDRESS>Princeton, New Jersey 08544-2086</ADDRESS>
<P>RE:  Computer Use Policy</P>
<P>Dear Mr. Ende:</P>
<P>We believe the clarification you issued yesterday regarding Princeton's
policy on use of the computer network for political purposes still falls short
of constitutional requirements.  We suggest a meeting with you and President
Shapiro to discuss the issue further; we are both available for a meeting during
the week of September 9 - 13.</P>
<P>Specifically, the memo issued yesterday will further confuse Princeton
students and staff regarding their political speech rights on the computer
network, and thus will inhibit speech protected by the New Jersey State
Constitution.  The memo rightly concedes that the policy statement dated July
19, 1996 is &quot;overly broad,&quot; and that &quot;students, faculty and staff
are generally free to communicate their person views on political candidates
using e- mail and the internet.&quot;  However, the memo goes on to state that &quot;Nonetheless,
we continue to ask everyone to bear in mind that the IRS may deem personal use
of University resources for campaign activities, including use of the internet,
to be political campaign activity by the University itself.&quot;</P>
<P>This final sentence is inaccurate as a matter of law.  As stated in our
letter dated August 15, 1996, <I>personal</I> use of the network for &quot;campaign
activities&quot; is constitutionally protected political speech and in no way
threatens Princeton's tax-exempt status.  See ACLU Letter to Princeton, 8/15/96,
at 2.  Because Princeton provides fair and equal access to the computer network
to all University members, and allows use of the network for a variety of
non-political purposes, the provision of computing facilities to students and
staff, even for campaigning activities, will not jeopardize the university's
501(c)(3) status.  The computer network is analogous to the Princeton commons,
where university students and staff have long been free to distribute and obtain
campaign literature and to encourage votes for particular political candidates. 
The fact that this activity is taking place on the computer network makes it no
less protected political speech.  In fact, campaign literature is arguably the
most fundamental type of speech in our democratic system of government.  There
is nothing more important in choosing our political leaders than knowing what
they stand for.</P>
<P>The recent statement is also vague and fails to notify university members
clearly as to whether personal use of the network for &quot;campaign activities&quot;
is a violation of university policy.  In addition, the University now has issued
at least five separate policies and statements that govern use of the computer
network for political purposes: the August 22, 1996 clarification memorandum;
the July 19, 1996 memorandum on &quot;Internet use and Policy;&quot; the &quot;Computer
Use&quot; guidelines at page 11 of the Rights, Rules, Responsibilities handbook;
the &quot;Guidelines Relating to the Tax-Exempt Status of the University and
Political Activities,&quot; at pages 14-15 of the Rights, Rules,
Responsibilities handbook; and the 1995-96 &quot;Guidelines for use of Campus
and Network Computing Resources.&quot;  These conflicting policies and
statements are sure to cause confusion among university members, which will
inhibit students and staff from exercising their right to free speech on the
computer network.</P>
<P>If you continue to believe that 501(c)(3) restrictions prevent certain
political communications over computer networks, we urge you to seek an advisory
ruling on the matter from the Internal Revenue Service.  In the meantime, all
five policies and statements must be clearly and unequivocally suspended, and a
statement must be issued clarifying that all university members and groups may
engage in political speech and campaign activities over the computer network so
long as they do not purport to speak for the university itself.</P>

<P>Because we are nearing the end of an election year, it is crucial that this

matter be resolved quickly in order to ensure that Princeton students and staff
are able to exercise fully their political speech rights.</P>
<P>Thank you for your prompt response to our prior letter and your willingness
to continue this important discussion.</P>
<P>Very truly yours,</P>

					RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS 
				</U>
				<BR>
			</CENTER>
		</B>
		Plaintiffs respectfully oppose the defendants' motion to dismiss. The complaint states a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and the plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims, because O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1 (1996) threatens an immediate and irreparable denial of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, and has already chilled the exercise of their rights to free expression and association. The defendants' motion that this Court abstain from exercising its jurisdiction should also be denied because the federal constitutional issues cannot be eliminated by any state court construction of the statute and abstention would simply delay an adjudication to protect the plaintiffs' rights. 
		<BR>

					FACTS 
				</B>
			</U>
			<P>
		</CENTER>
		Plaintiffs brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, seeking protection from the enforcement of O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1 in violation of their constitutional rights to free expression, association and privacy in online communications. As set forth in plaintiffs' briefs in support of their currently pending motion for preliminary injunction, this statute imposes two unconstitutional restrictions upon communications over computer networks: 
		<P>
		The first restriction prohibits communications over computer networks using a name that "falsely identifies" the user, and this restriction therefore bans among other things the use of online pseudonyms for the purpose of communicating and associating anonymously over computer networks. The second restriction in the statute bans the use of trade names and logos in a way that "would falsely state or imply" that the person using the name or logo has obtained permission to do so, and therefore appears potentially to restrict even protected, noncommercial use of trade names and logos in news, commentary, satire and parody. 
		<P>
		Each of the plaintiffs use or seek to use computer networks for protected online communications that are now prohibited by one or both of these restrictions. The details of the plaintiffs' online activities have previously been set forth for the Court at length in the plaintiffs' brief in support of their preliminary injunction motion and the affidavits filed by each of the plaintiffs in support of that motion.

		Complaint &#182;&#182; 4-17, 25-73, 86-171. For the purposes of this motion to dismiss, all of the allegations in the plaintiffs' complaint and the averments in their affidavits must be "accepted as true," and the motion to dismiss must be denied unless "it is clear that 'no relief could be granted under 
		<U>
			any

		<B>
			I. 
			<U>
				THE COMPLAINT STATES A CLAIM FOR RELIEF 
			</U>
		</B>
		<P>
		The first ground for defendants' motion to dismiss is their contention that the complaint fails to state a claim for relief. The sole basis for this contention is their argument that O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1 does not violate the plaintiffs' constitutional rights because it should be narrowly construed -- in fact, entirely rewritten -- to prohibit only "fraud and misrepresentation," or "the fraudulent practice of misappropriating someone else's identity or identifying mark or symbol." Defs. Brief at p. 5. For all the reasons set forth in the plaintiffs' reply brief in support of their preliminary injunction motion, this proposed construction of the statute contradicts its plain language and violates the rules of statutory interpretation, and it must be rejected. 
		<U>
			See 
		</U>
		Pls. Reply Brief at 2-22. For the same reason, the defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim must also be denied. 
		<P>
		Moreover, even if O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1 could be construed in the narrow and artificial way the defendants propose, that would not justify granting their motion to dismiss because the construction defendants' propose would not eliminate all of the statute's constitutional flaws. As set forth in plaintiffs' reply in support of their motion for preliminary injunction, the statute would remain unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and would still violate the Commerce Clause even if the Court rewrote it in the manner the defendants' suggest. 
		<P>
		Finally, the plain language of the statute does prohibit the plaintiffs' protected online expression. If the Court rejects the plaintiffs' objections to a radical rewriting of the statute and considers rewriting it according to one of the defendants' unnaturally narrow and restrictive constructions, plaintiffs still have clearly stated a cause of action for declaratory relief defining the scope of the rewritten statute and an injunction prohibiting any enforcement beyond that new construction. In addition to seeking declaratory and injunctive relief declaring the statute unconstitutional and preventing its enforcement, plaintiffs have prayed for "such other relief as the Court deems just and appropriate." Complaint, at 58. The defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim should therefore be denied.

					THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING AND THIS CASE PRESENTS A CLEAR AND IMMEDIATE CONTROVERSY UNDER ARTICLE III 
				</B>
			</U>
		</DL>
		<P>
		The defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of standing should also be denied. The allegations of the plaintiffs' complaint and the averments in their affidavits demonstrate the existence of a live controversy and establish that the plaintiffs are all proper parties with standing to bring their claims.

			Maryland Cas. Co. v. Pacific Coal & Oil Co. 
		</U>
		, 312 U.S. 270, 273 (1941)). The plaintiffs have standing to bring a pre-enforcement challenge to the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1 if there is "a realistic danger of sustaining direct injury as a result of the statute's operation or enforcement." 
		<U>
			ACLU v. Florida Bar 
		</U>
		, 999 F.2d 1486, 1492 (11th Cir. 1993). "When a plaintiff has stated that he intends to engage in a specific course of conduct 'arguably affected with a constitutional interest,'...he does not have to expose himself to enforcement to be able to challenge the law."

		<U>
			Graham v. Butterworth

		, 5 F.3d at 499. 
		<P>
		All of the plaintiffs therefore have standing in this case. Each of the plaintiffs or their members currently engage or seek to engage in online communications of the type banned by the plain language of O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1, and all of them are concerned that the law could be used to prosecute them or their members for engaging in these activities.

		One of the plaintiffs, Rep. Mitchell Kaye, has more particularized reasons for concern that the Act could be used to suppress his protected online expression. The web site he maintains on behalf of the Conservative Policy Caucus of the Georgia General Assembly has generated considerable controversy and been the subject of repeated efforts by the House leadership to suppress it.

		<P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			It just so happened this morning, that my wife and she didn't even know this was coming up today, but she'd asked me, she said one of the teachers at the school that she works at had asked her, was on the Internet, was going on the Internet and wanted to know, said he saw a couple different ones on there for the Georgia House of Representatives and wanted to know which one was the real one, and I told her - I - you'll - you'll just have to go in and look and see and try to determine which one really is the official home page of the Georgia House of Representatives.

				That is one of the, the situations that, that this bill would address.

		</U>
		Kaye Aff. &#182; 15. In contemporaneous press reports about the controversy, Rep.

		<U>
			Lawmakers target Kaye's Web Site 
		</U>
		, Marietta Daily Journal, 
		<P>
		p. 1 & 7A (Feb. 8, 1996). Thus, Rep. Kaye clearly has standing to bring this pre-enforcement challenge to the law.

			Smith v. Meese 
		</U>
		, 821 F.2d 1484, 1493 (11th Cir. 1987) ("It is clear that a direct target of a discriminatory investigation or prosecution has standing to attack the violation."). 
		<P>
		Several of the other plaintiffs also have their own particular reasons for concern that their members may be targeted for prosecution for their online expression under this law, because their members express potentially controversial minority viewpoints more likely to trigger selective prosecution under this vague law. In addition to the risk of criminal prosecution by state authorities, these potentially controversial plaintiffs and others similarly situated also face the risk of harassing lawsuits under the statute by private individuals who claim to have been "injured" as a result of their conduct. O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93(g) provides a private right of action for any person who contends their "property or person is injured" by reason of a violation of the Georgia Computer Systems Protection Act, which includes O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1. 
		<P>
		Members of the Atlanta Freethought Society, for example, are often the subject of harassment and threats for their views of religion and the separation of church and state. Lyle-Wilson Aff. &#182;&#182; 5-6. Similarly, many of the members of the AIDS Survival Project and the Atlanta Veterans Alliance are gays and lesbians often subject to discrimination, harassment and persecution as a result of social prejudices against them. Graham Aff. &#182; 7; Van Pelt &#182; 5. Since the members of these groups and several of the other plaintiffs routinely use pseudonyms to communicate in online communications, their allegations establish the threshold requirement for standing under the controlling cases because they establish that the plaintiffs "intend[] to engage in arguably protected conduct, which the statute seem[s] to proscribe."

			Even where a First Amendment challenge could be brought by one actually engaged in protected activity, there is a possibility that, rather than risk punishment for his conduct in challenging the statute, he will refrain from engaging further in the protected activity. Society as a whole then would be the loser. Thus, when there is a danger of chilling free speech, the concern that constitutional adjudication be avoided whenever possible may be outweighed by society's interest in having the statute challenged. Litigants, therefore, are permitted to challenge a statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute's very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected expression.

		These expanded rules of standing in the First Amendment context clearly apply to this lawsuit, which challenges a law that restricts free expression and association over computer networks.

		Finally, defendants cannot eliminate the plaintiffs' standing simply by arguing now in their briefs for an artificially narrow construction of O.C.G.A. &#167; 16-9-93.1. That was precisely the approach taken by the defendants in 
		<U>
			American Booksellers Ass'n, Inc. v. McAuliffe 
		</U>
		, who contended that the statute challenged in that case did not apply to the booksellers, librarians, and others plaintiffs because -- notwithstanding its much broader language -- the defendants argued the statute prohibited only "sexually explicit pornography.'" 533 F. Supp. at 58. The Court rejected the argument, holding that the "plaintiffs should not be forced to await prosecution on criminal charges before seeking a determination of the law's validity," and that "

As the Eleventh Circuit observed, the defendants were not bound by their court briefs in any future enforcement decisions, and the ultimate arbiter of the meaning of the challenged rule was not the defendants but the state Supreme Court. 999 F.2d at 1494. The Court observed that the defendants' arguments would not impose any res judicata limitations on their "discretion to change [their] policy regarding the interpretation and enforcement" of the challenged statute as soon as the case were dismissed. 999 F.2d at 1494. Thus, the Court concluded that: 
		<P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			a live dispute existed because (1) plaintiffs "wanted to pursue a specific course of action which they knew was at least arguably forbidden by the pertinent law"; and (2) "[a]ll that remained between the plaintiff and impending harm was the defendant's discretionary decision --which could be changed -- to withhold [enforcement]."

The Court held he had standing to challenge the statute despite the fact that prior to the suit the City Commission had passed a motion instructing the City Manager "to discontinue

			any and all prosecutorial action now and in the future 
		</U>
		with regard to the sign at issue." 
		<U>
			Id 
		</U>
		. at 1213. Because nothing prevented the city from reversing its position as soon as the suit was dismissed, however, the Court held that even this formal resolution against prosecuting the plaintiff did not eliminate standing or the existence of a live controversy appropriate for declaratory judgment.

		<P>
		For the same reasons, the defendants' arguments in their briefs cannot eliminate the plaintiffs' standing. If this case were dismissed, nothing would stop the defendants from reversing their position. Their pleadings in this case would not bind their prosecutorial discretion in any way, nor would their arguments have any effect on the discretion of their successors in office or the dozens of individual county district attorneys throughout the state with independent authority to bring prosecutions under the statute. Nor would the defendants' statutory construction arguments in their briefs in this case bind the state courts of Georgia in their interpretation of the statute.

			The abstention doctrine is not an automatic rule applied whenever a federal court is faced with a doubtful issue of state law.... We doubt, in the first place, that a construction of the oath provisions, in light of the vagueness challenge, would avoid or fundamentally alter the constitutional issue raised in this litigation. In the bulk of abstention cases in this Court, including those few cases where vagueness was at issue, the unsettled issue of state law principally concerned the applicability of the challenged statute to a certain person or a defined course of conduct, whose resolution in a particular manner would eliminate the constitutional issue and terminate the litigation....

The environmental, health and safety regulatory arena is constantly changing. Even for the seasoned environmental professional, it is difficult to keep abreast of all new regulations, statutory revisions, and compliance deadlines. ERM has developed a regulatory alert program to provide industry, environmental and legal professionals with a summary of each new rule, a tool to determine if you are affected by the rule, and methods to comply. Browse our regulatory alert library to discover what rules are highlighting the current compliance agenda.

<H4>The company was committed to compliance. What it needed 
was a pair of outside eyes to help do it better.</H4>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>n October 1994 Lock & Load, Inc. (L&L), asked ERM to help "identify and characterize" solid waste generated at its 
5,100-employee, 1.5 million-square-foot facility in southern Georgia. That's where, 
in more than 200 facility departments, L&L designs, assembles and tests weapons systems for military use.
<p>	
ERM's assignment 
was to help L&L comply with federal and state regulations involving the management and disposal of solid wastes and important hazardous wastes. 
<p>
As a RCRA-permitted hazardous waste storage facility, L&L was required 
to develop and implement a Waste Analysis Plan (WAP) documenting the company's procedures for character-izing hazardous waste streams. ERM's job was to ensure that the WAP was up-to-date, and that all waste streams were being appropriately managed-
a project that required the cataloging of all generated wastes and a series of department audits.
<p>	
For L&L, the project 
was a way of ensuring that the firm was acting as a responsible employer and corporate good neighbor, 
as well as complying with regulatory requirements.		
<p>
	From the outset, however, L&L realized that it lacked the time and expertise to handle the job alone. 
<p>

<TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<CAPTION ALIGN=BOTTOM><B>Herin</B></CAPTION>
<TR><TD>
<IMG SRC="/gif/chris.gif">
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

	"In my experience," says ERM project director Chris Herin, "this was not a 
common project. It was unique since L&L asked 
us to provide an external 
set of eyes to examine 
what it had done, and offer suggestions on how it could be improved."  
<p>	
Identifying and characterizing solid wastes is one of those routine tasks that turn out to be not routine at all. The project involved inventorying every waste stream in the huge facility -from old rocket propellant to plastic laser printer toner cartridges in office trash, and from plating sludges 
to air filters. By June 1996, ERM had identified nearly 1,200 waste streams, a 
quarter of which were 
hazardous. "One of the best things about the project," 
says Herin, "is that we developed a partnering arrangement with L&L as opposed to the standard consultant/client relationship. We had desk space 
in L&L's offices and felt comfortable going to work there. We didn't have to 
tiptoe around."  
<p>
	L&L wanted to do 
more than merely update 
its documentation. What the company needed were ideas on how to better manage its waste-related liabilities, as well as recommendations for improving training, 
waste minimization and
pollution prevention. 
<p>
	Four months before 
ERM became actively involved, L&L had circulated waste generation surveys to all its departments. Information from the surveys was used by ERM to develop a compatible database. When an L&L department reported generating no waste, ERM team members would call, fax or e-mail requesting 
verification. They asked how the department disposed 
of used toner cartridges from its copy machines or batteries from its telephones. This resulted in the identification of a number of 
"new" waste streams.
<p>
	The ERM team created a separate tracking system for each waste stream, and the resulting characterizations were reviewed by at least two members of the ERM team. Did it meet the 40 CFR 261 definition of solid waste? Was it specifically exempted from the regulations, or exempted because it was reclaimed material? 	
<p>
Was it adequately characterized for land disposal restriction purposes? ERM provided the answers. Waste streams were characterized as non-hazardous or by their EPA hazardous waste codes, as well as subclassifications specific to L&L's operations and desire to integrate GIS tracking into facility management.	
<p>
	By June 1995, ERM 
had developed recommen-dations to improve the 
management of many waste streams, including a series of waste management 
protocol memoranda for L&L's environmental affairs department to use with company departments that were delinquent in turning in reports for the waste stream tracking system and that needed improvement in waste management procedures. Beyond the recommendations, ERM met with 
the L&L environmental coordinators assigned in each department to brief them on the report and 
its implications. 
<p>
	L&L's coordinators,
after receiving the recommendations, returned to their departments empowered to communicate 
corrective actions to 
appropriate departmental staff. (Department heads 
had an extra incentive to 
listen to these coordinators: Their bonuses were tied to environmental performance.) 
<p>
Then, three months later, ERM scheduled on-site, follow-up audits with almost half of the facility's departments (those that generated the most waste) to verify that corrective actions had occurred. Departments selected for the surprise audits were ones requiring corrections that could be spot-checked visually, or that had long lists of 
suggested corrections. All corrections having to do with hazardous wastes had been addressed. But some corrections suggested for non-hazardous wastes, ERM found, had not occurred-especially in the area of 
recycling. Further follow-up was turned over to L&L's corporate environmental affairs department-which, by the way, was also audited. 
<p>	
"What's left," says Herin, "is training and information dissemination"-undertakings being managed by L&L. "This," he says, "was a very satisfying job for the ERM team. We fulfilled a very large waste management requirement for L&L, and we were able to do it by working cooperatively with 
a large number of its departments and staff."

<P>
After five years and more than 200 projects, ERM's on-site field analysis ERM-FAST service (Field Analytical Services Technology) has become established as a major force at the leading edge of environmental intervention. Clients have a variety of reasons for choosing ERM-FAST. Instead of sending samples to a lab, ERM-FAST vans or trailers come to client sites to:	
<p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain real-time data
<li>Focus investigations
<li>Evaluate remediation efforts
<li>Reduce the total 
number of samples sent to the fixed laboratory
<li>Protect sampling 
personnel
<li>Reduce total project costs.
</ul>
<p>
A typical scenario: In a RCRA facility site closure action, soil and water samples need to be evaluated to determine if clean closure requirements will be met. By calling in ERM-FAST, you can pre-evaluate samples without sending samples off-site. 		
<p>	
Another example: At a prepurchase investigation at a shopping center where underground storage tanks and contaminated soils had been removed, ERM-FAST was used to screen subsurface soil samples for petroleum fraction and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) utilizing the mobile GC/MS. When field screening indicated only a low-level contamination, 
the purchaser decided to go ahead with the acquisition with a minimum of delay 
and cost.
<p>
	ERM's scientists can tailor field analyses to meet the needs of any project, or configure an appropriate system from site background or prior laboratory analysis. ERM-FAST units are equipped with portable gas chromatographs, mobile gas chromatograph/ mass spectrometers and/or energy dispersive mobile X-ray fluorescence spectrometers and can perform analyses on most environmental sample matrices for volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, metals, pesticides and PCBs, herbicides and explosives. 	
<p>	
And ERM-FAST is fast: 
A team can begin analysis within 30 minutes of reaching a site.

<H4>The client needed a solution--neither too basic nor too acidic--and with minimal sediment. Oh, and it couldn't cost too much. </H4>
<IMG SRC="/gif/178.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<FONT SIZE=+3>O</FONT>perating engineers 
at two dyeing and 
finishing facilities run by Spectrum, along the Okapokee River in North Carolina were, 
to put it nicely, frustrated.
<p> 
No matter what steps 
they took, they couldn't control the pH of their wastewater effluent. 
<p>
The plants were located adjacent to the town's 
publicly owned treatment works (POTW), and although Spectrum tried 
to be a good neighbor, 
the POTW had issued it violation noticestwo in a one-year periodand there seemed to be nothing the engineers could do about it. 
The notices were for 
producing caustic effluent in excess of pH 9, 
the upper discharge limit. (Spectrum also exceeded the lower 
discharge limit, pH 6.) 
<p>
So in March 1994, Spectrum asked ERM in Charlotte, North Carolina, to determine what was wrong and to come up with the most cost-efficient wastewater pretreatment system possible.
<p>
"The traditional approach to the problem," recalls ERM's Ken Pickle, senior engineer on the project, "would have been to follow the old engineering axiom 'When in doubt, make it stout'in this 
case simply building a 
large pH neutralization basin." At the time, Spectrum's effluent was 1.6 
million gallons per day; 
the firm anticipated an expansion of production that would result in a 
3.0 mgd discharge. 
<p> 

<TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<CAPTION ALIGN=BOTTOM><B>Pickle</B></CAPTION>
<TR><TD>
<IMG SRC="/gif/pickle.gif">
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

The POTW (and tradition) suggested construction of a 3 million-gallon, 24-hour retention basinto which appropriate acids and caustics would be added to maintain the desired pH range. That would have done the job, but construction costs were estimated at $2.25 million more than the client wanted to spendand that size basin would have 
used more plant property than Spectrum wanted 
to allocate. 
<p>
From the outset, 
Pickle and ERM's project engineer, Dudney Fox, 
realized that the size of the retention basin would be the key factor in holding down costs; the larger the basin, the more clearing, grubbing, grading and excavating would have to be done, and the more would have to be spent on concrete liner, PVC liner and floating aerators. 
<p>
"We decided to reduce the doubt part of the 'When in doubt, make it stout' equation," says Pickle, and ERM started doing research to help  characterize Spectrum's wastewater.
<p>
Facility records were useful but not sufficient. So ERM conducted a field study. Project team members collected effluent 
measurements for the two 
facilities every two minutes for five days. The pH range for one plant ran from 
1.8 to 12.6; the other
ranged from 4.2 to 11.7. 
<p>
Ninety percent of the flow was basicwith a mean pH of more than 9.0so the team surmised that all they had to do was modify the existing sulfuric acid feed system to add acid in an amount that would offset the basic pH. However, since the lower pH discharge limit was 6, they would also have to have a sufficient basin volume to provide bulk neutralization of the ten percent of the wastewater flows that were acidicwhere the pH ran as low as 1.8. And more volume was what they were trying to avoid.
<p>
The team members decided to examine the chemical mechanisms that controlled the wastewater's pH values. The most important of these, they determined, was the carbonate systemthe set of equations that describe how acids and bases commingle in a closed system to yield one pH value or another. 
<p>
For the sake of developing a model, they made the major assumption that the neutralization basin could be represented as a closed carbonate species system. They knew it would be subject to error, but it was a starting point. Says Pickle, "The testing and modeling was particularly exciting for us, because although the theory behind it is widely accepted, it's not that often applied
at least not in our experience. So it was fun to get down to manipulating the equations and seeing where we could go with it." 
<p>

<TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=LEFT>
<CAPTION ALIGN=BOTTOM><B>Fox</B></CAPTION>
<TR><TD>
<IMG SRC="/gif/dudney.gif">
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


They developed the model and then, to test it, took grab samples over four days. The actual acid volumes required for each wastewater titration, they found, were only 57% of their model's predictions. They recalibrated the model, developed a worst-case scenario for acid flow and presented Spectrum with a 20-page preliminary engineering report arguing for a system that could treat 3 mgd: a 320,000-
gallon basin that would hold wastewater for only 21/2 hoursmore than nine times smaller than tradition had suggested.
<p>
At first, Spectrum was skeptical. Then they upped the basin's proposed size to 375,000 gallons and the detention time to three hours and began working to convince the POTW 
that the approach was 
feasible. That was when ERM's second task for Spectrum emerged.
<p> 
During their conversations with Spectrum, the POTW engineers brought up another issue that had concerned them. Over time, Spectrum had also been cited for discharging total suspended solids (TSS) in excess of their permit limits. Not true, Spectrum contended. Then why, the POTW engineers asked, did the POTW so often have to clear out 
settled solids from their own settling basin? 
<p>
ERM was asked to investigate. The plant team from Spectrum discovered that settled solids from Spectrum's flocculation basin and rapid flow sand filtersused to clean incoming Okapokee River water for use in the 
plantswere periodically being discharged into 
the plant's wastewater effluent, carrying heavy loads of TSS.
<p>
The team came up with an economical solution: segregate the floc basin sludge and sand 
filter backwash flows 
from the dyehouse effluent, and route the segregated flow to a million-gallon alum sludge settling basin instead of discharging it 
to the POTW. After settling, the water carrying the solids could be recycled to the water plant instead 
of being discharged into the effluent sewer.
That solution resulted in a cessation of citations and annual savings in sewer charges of some $30,000effectively amortizing the construction and engineering costs of the basin within five years.
<p>
Meanwhile, the POTW agreed to the non-traditional approach suggested by ERM. Within 18 months the project was completed. Cost of the extra engineering required to develop the calibrated predictive model of the carbonate species buffering action amounted to $12,000. Capital investment savings for construction of the 375,000-gallon  pH neutralization basincompared to the cost of the traditional 3 million-gallon basinwere  in the neighborhood of $1.78 million. 
<p>
Pickle and Fox's 
creativity and their willingness to buck tradition to meet their client's needs saved Spectrum's capital improvement budget 
nearly $2 million, and 
their operating engineers 
a lot of headaches and
frustration.

<B> ISO 14001 Environmental Management System Standard to Become Final</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/gif/flam.gif" ALIGN=LEFT> The International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) is expected to finalize the draft ISO 14001 standard for Environmental Management Systems (EMS) early this summer. ISO 14001 is one of a series of voluntary environmental standards.
<p>
It is the only standard in the ISO 14000 series 
for which ISO certification can be achieved. 
<p>
The other ISO 14000 standards are considered 
to be guidance documents for implementing and maintaining environmental performance. They can be used to enhance implementation of an organizations EMS. They cover environmental auditing, environmental performance evaluation, 
eco-labeling, life cycle assessment and the 
environmental aspects of product standards. They are in various stages of development. 
<p>
Why be interested? The decision for any organization to seek ISO certification or self-declaration will ultimately be unique to that entity. Motives for adoption might include enhancing environmental performance and compliance, increasing market share/competitive advantage and/or improving public image. When the standard becomes final, how these factors and others can affect your decision to adopt the standard should become clear.
<p> 
The draft ISO 14001 standard emphasizes the establishment and maintenance of an 
EMS in order to improve protection of human 
welfare and the environment. The standard 
contains five elements for a management system. These elements address environmental policy, planning, implementation and operation, checking and corrective action, and management review. 
<p> 
The standard does 
not prescribe performance expectations of an organization. For example, it does not specify the 
number of years an EMS annual audit must be 
conducted. Rather, the organization must specify the performance requirements based upon the goals of the organization and the environmental aspects and impacts associated with its activities, products, and services.
For more information on ISO 14001, contact Deborah Tansey at ERM,
610-524-3500.

Since the U.S. Congress defeat of the Superfund reauthorization, not much activity has taken place in the site remediation regulatory area until recently with the proposed Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR).

<P>
Since the promulgation of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) in 1990, considered the most significant piece of legislation ever enacted, the area of air quality compliance has seen more activity than any other regulatory issue.  The CAAA Title V Operating Permit requirements are unprecedented in the compliance arena.  Also, the RMP under 112(r) is an applicability that should not be overlooked.  Listed below are recent air quality regulatory alerts developed by ERM.

<P>
Impending OSHA budget cuts and reductions in the staff of regulatory officers have given some industry professionals the misconceived notion that they can be lax in the area of health and safety compliance.<BR>
<B>Warning:</B>The OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Rule is not an issue to be ignored.  If applicable, compliance to PSM is imperative; otherwise, a facility can be faced with large penalties if it is found negligent in its effort to comply.  Link yourself to ERM's PSM regulatory alert below to find out more about this high impacting rule.

ERM NAMES LAWRENCE B. CAHILL PRINCIPAL<P>

</H3>


EXTON, Pa. -- October 30, 1996 -- Lawrence B. Cahill has been named
a principal by Environmental Resources Management (ERM), an international
environmental, health and safety consulting firm.  Cahill, a senior program
director in ERM's Management Consulting Group located in Exton, is an
internationally recognized environmental auditing expert.  <p>
"Larry Cahill has more than 20 years of environmental experience with
industry, mainly working for numerous <I>Fortune 500</I> companies," remarks Kent
E. Patterson, ERM president.  "He has developed, evaluated and certified
environmental, health and safety (EH&S) auditing programs, conducted
hundreds of audits, and trained literally thousands of people worldwide in
auditing skills."  <p>
Cahill also has prepared an auditor's opinion letter for major companies
that formally certifies the effectiveness of their EH&S audit programs and
appears in their annual environmental reports.  <p>
Since 1983, he has taught an Environmental Audits course for the
Government Institutes (GI), in Rockville, Md., a publisher and continuing
education organization specializing in EH&S concerns, and has been designated a
<I>"Distinguished Instructor"</I> by GI.  Cahill has edited and authored a number of
books in his area of expertise.  His latest book, <I>Environmental Audits - 7th
Edition</I>, which was edited for and published by the Government Institutes in
March 1996, provides a comprehensive overview of EH&S auditing, legal issues
and staff development.  
<p>
Recently, Cahill published an insightful, humorous article, entitled
<I>Environmental Audit Training in the Far East: A Wok on the Wild Side</I>, that
recounts his trip last year to conduct EH&S audit training for a major company in
Singapore and Japan.  He discusses cultural differences, such as his perception
that the Japanese do not appear to be as probing as U.S. auditors because it is not
considered proper in their culture.  <p>
Additionally, Cahill serves as co-chairperson of the Auditor Qualifications
Workgroup of the Environmental Auditing Roundtable, and he was a member of
the Standards Conformance Registration Advisory Group (SCRAG)
commissioned by the U.S. Technical Advisory Group to develop a
recommendation on the organization(s) that would meet the objectives for
company registrations and auditor certification under ISO 14000 in the United
States.  <p>
Cahill holds a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Northeastern
University, an M.S. in Environmental Health Engineering from Northwestern
University, and an M.B.A. in Public Management from the Wharton School of
the University of Pennsylvania.  Before joining ERM, he was a project engineer
with Exxon Research and Engineering where he audited plants in the United
States, Canada and Europe.  <p>

ERM ADVANCES TO 25TH PLACE
IN ENR TOP 500 DESIGN FIRM RANKINGS

</H3>

<!-- text -->
EXTON, Pa. -- May 3, 1996 -- The Environmental Resources Management (ERM) Group advanced to 25th place among U.S. engineering firms in the Engineering News Record Top 500 Design Firms listing recently released for 1995, compared to 27th place in the previous year.  In the international design category, ERM continued in 23rd place for the 1995 ENR rankings.  
<p>	In the hazardous waste area, ERM ranked fourth among the top 20 firms for 1995.  According to ENR, billings remained flat at $3.3-billion for the top 20 players in the hazardous waste field.  For the top 500 firms, though, 1995 hazardous waste billings dropped to $5.3-billion from $5.45-billion in 1994.  The rankings are based on total billings.  
<p>	Industry observers attributed last year's decline to cuts in federal agency cleanup contracting and enforcement budgets, along with a slowdown in enacting environmental legislation.  "Despite the overall business dropoff among hazardous waste firms, ERM's revenues increased to $283-million for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1996, compared to $275-million for the previous year," according to Jack C. Newell, an ERM principal.  
<p>	"ERM continues to grow worldwide," said Newell.  "During 1995, we opened eight new offices in North America and overseas to meet the expanding global needs of our industrial client base."

ERM RANKED 17th LARGEST HAZARDOUS WASTE
CONTRACTOR IN ENR TOP 20 LISTINGS

</H3>

<!-- text -->
EXTON, Pa. -- May 24, 1996 -- The Environmental Resources Management (ERM) Group was once again ranked as the 17th largest hazardous waste contractor in a list of the Top 20 hazardous waste contractor market leaders, according to the <I>Engineering News-Record (ENR) Top 400 Contractors</I> listing recently released.  
<p>	For contractors in all markets, ERM ranked 385th in construction revenues for 1995.  The rankings are based on construction revenues for last year, which totaled $55.2-million for ERM.  
<p>	Industry analysts characterized 1995 as a year when environmental remediation and construction markets were significantly growing, nearly 11 percent over the previous year.  Said Jack C. Newell, an ERM principal, "We continue to see a number of environmental cleanup projects moving from the assessment and engineering phase into site remediation work.  This includes work from the private sector, U.S. Department of Defense projects, as well as an increasing amount of international work."
<p>	ERM's total revenues increased nine percent to $283-million for fiscal year 1996 (ending March 31, 1996), compared to the previous year.  The company expects another year of growth and anticipates that its business will reach approximately $300-million by the end of fiscal year 1997, according to Newell.  <I>ENR</I> previously reported ERM's growth when it announced that ERM had moved up from #27 to #25 of the Top 500  architectural/
engineering firms in the United States.

expands ERM's presence in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.  <p>
PPA, founded in Puerto Rico in 1986 by Pedro J. Panzardi, is a process,
environmental and U.S. FDA regulatory compliance consulting firm. 
"Formation of Panzardi-ERM is an important part of ERM's global
growth strategy to expand its services in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean to serve
its multinational clients who have a number of facilities there," says Paul H.
Woodruff, ERM chairman, CEO and founder.  "Additionally, Panzardi &
Associates have a strong expertise in FDA regulatory compliance work that will
expand by providing this service to ERM's worldwide pharmaceutical clients." 
Pedro J. Panzardi, president of Panzardi-ERM, remarks:  "We have one
of the largest, if not <I>the</I> largest, staff of any consulting firm in Latin America
dedicated specifically to the pharmaceutical, beverage, chemical, food processing
and electronic industries."  The company has international experience and has
worked in Cuba (for the UN Development Program), Dominican Republic,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Jamaica and the British Virgin islands. <P>
Panzardi-ERM has a bilingual staff of more than 20 qualified personnel
who offer combined experience in all areas of process, environmental and project
engineering from developing feasibility studies, assessments, and project
concepts to final engineering drawings and specifications; as well as cost
estimates, construction supervision, startup, operational assistance, training,
validation, and operation and maintenance.  <p>
A recognized leader in environmental technology, Pedro Panzardi
introduced the first Rotary Biological Contactor (RBC) and Sequencing Batch
Reactor (SBR) in Puerto Rico.  He is also responsible for the first known
application of SBR to pharmaceutical process wastewaters in the United States. 
Panzardi's expertise in environmental engineering is well established.  He
has built a successful career in technical management and process  engineering in
the pharmaceutical industry since he first started working at Eli-Lilly Industries in
1970.  Panzardi has 26 years of experience in environmental and process
engineering consulting work in Puerto Rico, much of it for pharmaceutical
companies.  <p>
Born in New York City, Panzardi attended elementary school in
Paterson, New Jersey, before his family relocated to Puerto Rico.  He holds a
B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Puerto Rico and a
Masters degree in Environmental Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute.  Panzardi is a Registered Professional Engineer in Puerto Rico and
Florida.  <p>

EMERGING ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES CONFRONTING
INDUSTRY IN LATIN AMERICA AIRED <P>

</H3>

MIAMI  -- October 25, 1996 -- Increasing trade and foreign investment in
Latin America mean that companies doing business there will need to meet
developing local environmental regulations and challenges, according to experts
on Latin America.  Businessmen attending an all-day conference here learned
from the experts what the current environmental issues are in Latin America. 
<P>
Environmental Resources Management (ERM), a global environmental,
health and safety consulting firm, presented the conference, an international
seminar involving all its offices in one region of the world.  <P>
"The major Latin American countries have an environmental regulatory
framework in place, but the political will to enforce the regulations has not
matured," remarked Arnon E. Garonzik, managing director of ERM-Latin
America in Exton, Pa.  <P>
According to Paul Gruber, principal of ERM in Tampa, Florida, "The
main driving force in environmental management in Latin America is the concern
of multinational companies to maintain a high level of environmental integrity." 
Other speakers described the environmental regulatory picture in different Latin
American countries.  <P>
Brazil has had national environmental legislation since 1981 which
requires environmental licensing of potential pollution sources and environmental
impact assessments, according to Eugenio Singer, principal of SEMCO-ERM do
Brasil Ltda. in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  He pointed out, "State governments have
historically played a much larger role in environmental protection than the federal government, and trends for new federal standards and
regulations can be anticipated by new regulations in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio
de Janeiro and Minas Gerais.       <P>
In Chile, a new copper and gold rush are driving the economy.  The
environmental framework is characterized by a multiplicity of environmental
agencies, obsolete laws and regulations, an increasing level of penalties and the
principle that the polluter must pay, explained Jorge A. David, executive director
of ERM-Chile S.A. in Santiago, Chile, formed earlier this year.  <P>
David noted that proposed legislation, which would update Chile's
environmental laws and regulations, has been postponed four times and was
rejected in October 1996.  He described the results of the Environmental
Pollution Prevention Program (EP3) in Chile, which he managed for U.S. AID
to promote industrial eco-efficiency, waste minimization and source reduction. 
Pedro J. Panzardi, principal of Panzardi-ERM, Inc. in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, the newest ERM location, talked about the impact of the repeal of Section
936 of the U.S. tax code by the U.S. Congress.  Section 936 provided a tax
exemption to U.S. companies operating in Puerto Rico since 1976.  "We expect
new tax incentives to be proposed by the U.S. Congress depending on the
outcome of the U.S. presidential election.  Additionally, many 936 corporations
will continue to operate in Puerto Rico for at least 10 years and longer.  They all
will continue to build environmental infrastructure and need environmental
services," he said.  <p>
In Bolivia, new environmental regulations were issued in 1995 that
establish discharge limits for air and water as well as guidelines for solid
waste/dangerous substances management.  The regulations also define who is the
appropriate environmental authority and the requirements for new and existing
operations.
<P>
"Bolivia now has a clear environmental regulatory framework and a high
potential for growth, " said Carlos Meave, managing director of Ecologia y
Empresa S.R.L., an environmental consultant in La Paz, Bolivia.  <BR>
In Venezuela, enforcement of environmental laws has been relatively lax
in the past, but is strengthening.  The criminal courts can, however, impose
fines, arrest and sentence members of company management responsible for
environmental damage.  This means, cautioned Elisabeth E. Eljuri, senior
associate with Baker & McKenzie, an international law firm with offices in
Caracas, Venezuela, that companies operating in Venezuela should obtain the
required environmental authorizations and take no risks.  <p>
"It's clear from today's conference," added Garonzik, "that ERM has
significant resources within Latin America to handle many different types of
solutions to environmental problems without significant importation of skills
from outside the region."  He added, "ERM will continue to build on its
capabilities in Latin America to serve both our multinational and local clients with
operations in the region.  The latest addition of Panzardi-ERM to our organization
is an example of this growth."

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN LATIN AMERICA DISCUSSED BY THE EXPERTS<P>
<I>Upcoming conference to cover hot environmental topics affecting industry in Latin America</I>
</H3>

MIAMI -- September 19, 1996 -- Current environmental issues affecting private industry in Latin America will be discussed at an all-day conference presented by Environmental Resources Management (ERM) on October 25 in Miami.  ERM is an international environmental, health and safety consulting firm.<p>

The conference offers business executives and environmental, health and safety (EHS) professionals who are contemplating or conducting trade and investment in Latin America the opportunity to learn what the most critical environmental issues are, according to Arnon E. Garonzik, managing director of ERM-Latin America.<p>

Topics to be covered include waste management and remediation, regulatory issues, environmental regulatory program development and hemispheric free trade.<p>

"Companies interested in developing or maintaining businesses in Latin America need to meet the local environmental challenges and comply with regulations if they wish to succeed in that market," says Paul Gruber, president of ERM-South, an ERM member with offices in Tampa, Miami and throughout Florida.<p>

Garonzik notes, "The outlook for direct foreign investment and improved trade between North America and Latin America has returned to a new level of optimism.  We think that as the local Latin American economies grow, they will generate a new middle class that will become a dynamic force in improving quality of life issues -- especially the environment." As a result, continues Garonzik, "meeting environmental challenges and regulations will become essential to business growth."<p>

Business executives attending the conference will hear experts from ERM's Latin American companies in Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Puerto Rico as well as ERM offices in Florida.  Joining ERM and offering a unique perspective on Latin
American trade will be the international law firm of Greenberg Traurig of 
Miami.  Other speakers include Jim Bacchus, former U.S. Congressman for central
Florida; Ambler H. Moss, former Ambassador to Panama; and Beatriz Merino, 
Congresswoman of the Republic of Peru.<p>

Co-sponsoring the conference with ERM is the Florida Manufacturing and Chemical
Council and Florida International University's Hemispheric Center on 
Environmental Technology.<p>

The October 25 conference on <i><b>Hot environmental Topics Affecting Private
Industry in Latin America"</b></i> will be held at the Miami Airport Hilton
Towers.  Registration is $150 per person.  For more information, contact Pam
Lepley at ERM at (610) 524-3522 or Mercedes Estrada at (813) 622-8727.<p>

ERM is a global consulting organization of 2,400 environmental, health and safety specialists at 99 locations in 24 countries.  The firm is one of the world's largest providers of environmental consulting and engineering services to industry, and offers air quality, wastewater, hazardous and solid waste management;  site assessment and remediation; human health and ecological risk assessment; process safety; management consulting; information management; analytical laboratory services and turnkey construction.<p>

ERM IS UK'S TOP ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTING FIRM 
</H3>

<!-- text -->
EXTON, Pa. -- July  9, 1996 -- Environmental Resources Management (ERM) Group is the United Kingdom's top multiservice environmental consulting firm, according to an independent market survey carried out by Environmental Data Services.  The survey, <I>Environmental Consultancy in the UK:  A Market Analysis 1995</I>, highlights ERM as the only company making the top 20 in each of 12 work areas, a cross-section that includes the treatment of contaminated land, environmental management and auditing, and waste management.  The survey estimates that during the past two years the sector has grown by about 25 percent to an annual turnover of more than $600-million. 
<p>	ERM is also singled out as the most globally active among the nearly 400 environmental consulting firms operating in the U.K.  "We had to get global to maintain our position," says Robin Bidwell, CEO of ERM in the U.K.  "Clients were looking for offices near where they operated and since the late 1980s, we have located offices across Europe and Asia and are developing a presence in South America."  
<p>	The survey points to a maturing market in which growth in spending has slowed since the rapid expansion of the late 1980s.  "Still, growth could double its turnover by 2000 -- if businesses take up environmental management systems, legislation is properly enforced and new legislative drivers are introduced," Bidwell remarks.

NJDEP AWARDS LABORATORY CERTIFICATION FOR ERM-FAST&reg; SERVICE <P>
</H3>

 EXTON, Pa. -- November 13, 1996 -- The New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection (NJDEP) has awarded laboratory certification to
Environmental Resources Management (ERM) for its ERM-FAST&reg; environ
mental laboratory analysis service.  To receive certification, ERM successfully
met the stringent criteria established by the state of New Jersey.  These included
the analysis of performance evaluation samples, facility audits and quality
assurance documentation review.  ERM is a leading global environmental, health
and safety consulting firm.  <p>
     "The NJDEP certification attests to the proficiency and competency of
ERM-FAST's environmental analytical capabilities," according to William
Goldschmidt, ERM-FAST business manager in Exton.  "This level of recognized
proficiency and expertise is important to industrial companies and regulatory
agencies that are selecting an environmental laboratory for project analytical
support."  <p>
     ERM-FAST provides both mobile and fixed-base laboratory analytical
services from its operating bases in Exton, Pennsylvania and Los Alamos, New
Mexico.  "The service has been providing critical and cost effective analytical
support since 1990 for a wide variety of environmental site investigation and
remediation projects from the screening level through fully approved regulatory
methods," says Goldschmidt.<p>
     To meet the need for rapid analytical results, ERM offers the alternative of
on-site analysis of wastes through its Field Analytical Services Technology
(ERM-FAST).  This service consists of fully self-supported, mobile field   <p>
screening units which bring laboratory quality, instrumentation, methods and
degreed chemists to the field to provide real-time analytical results, he explains.
     For more information about ERM-FAST's capabilities and analytical
service, contact Bill Goldschmidt at (610) 524-3518.  <p>

NEW CONCEPT IN CHEMICAL OUTSOURCING ADDS INNOVATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPONENT<P>
<I>SCMG is a unique chemical procurement <BR>
and environmental management<BR>
service that cuts costs.</I>
</H3>


ATLANTA -- November 1, 1996 -- The Strategic Chemical
Management Group (SCMG) has been formed to provide an innovative
chemical sourcing and management service, with an environmental
management component.  SCMG is a joint venture of two companies,
Environmental Resources Management (ERM), a global environmental, health
and safety consulting firm, and EcoLink, a technology firm focusing on
alternatives for ozone-depleting substances.  SCMG has contracts with three
electric utilities.  <p>
Key benefits of the strategic sourcing service include enhanced
utilization of client personnel resources, reduced environmental liability,
significant cost savings on chemical purchases and a reduction in associated
overhead costs.  <p>
"By combining strategic environmental management with chemical
procurement, this approach takes chemical sourcing through its natural
evolution," says Paul H. Woodruff, ERM Group president and chief executive
officer.  "SCMG has developed a holistic program that views the procurement
function as a true source reduction opportunity that results in reduced chemical
emissions to the environment."  <p>
The customer outsources part or all of its chemical procurement needs
to SCMG.  SCMG then works closely with the customer to ensure timely
delivery of the best possible, environmentally preferred chemical products at
the most economical prices.  Additionally, the customer will realize savings in
staffing, material handling and inventory management, according to Anita
Neidert, SCMG cofounder and a principal in ERM's Atlanta office.  <p>
"Working as an integrated team, SCMG, the customer and suppliers
share responsibility for successful implementation of activities, such as OSHA
training, SARA reporting and waste disposal," comments Neidert.  <p>
Bill Green, SCMG cofounder, adds,  "Program success is measured
not only by cost savings, but also by successful product implementation,
environmental compliance and ultimately, customer satisfaction."  <p>
Neidert explains, "From an environmental, health and safety (EHS)
perspective, a strategic sourcing alliance will enhance the primary partner's
understanding of the chemical procurement process and its integration into
EHS management."  She adds that one of the important features of SCMG is
that the chemical user is no longer solely responsible for managing the EHS
ramifications of the purchased chemicals.  <p>
Neidert and Green believe that the strategic sourcing alliance form of
chemical management is particularly appropriate for companies grappling with
the management of hazardous chemicals.  "A well-managed strategic sourcing
program is the ultimate source reduction/pollution prevention effort which
yields verifiable cost savings," emphasize both SCMG founders.  

<p>


SCMG is working with two electric utilities, Southern California
Edison Co. and Florida Power Corp.  As a result of engaging SCMG to
manage more than 2,000 different chemicals, S. California Edison has been
able to reduce its number of chemical vendors from several hundred to eight
and expects to save about 10 percent on its chemical costs during the first year
of implementation.  Additionally, notes Neidert, the company has just signed a
contract with Public Service Electric and Gas Co. of New Jersey.  SCMG
expects to expand its work with the utility industry and plans to offer its
services to other chemical users.  <p>
For more information about SCMG, contact Anita Neidert at ERM, 300
Chastain Center Blvd, Suite 375, Kennesaw, GA 30144, or phone (770) 590
8383 or fax (770) 590-9164.  <p>

LITERATURE OFFERS HELP IN DIAGNOSING
"SICK BUILDING SYNDROME"

</H3>

<!-- text -->
EXTON, Pa. - May 13, 1996 - New literature entitled "<I>Indoor Air Quality Surveys</I>" is now available from the Environmental Resources Management (ERM) Group to address the problems of "Sick Building Syndrome" and "Building Related Illness".  
<p>	The literature presents ERM's capabilities and experience in determining whether there is an indoor air quality (IAQ) problem, the source of the problem and the most cost-effective remedy.  According to ERM, current building designs focus on ways to minimize energy losses through natural and mechanical ventilation control.  These energy-efficient controls may, however, also allow potentially harmful contaminants to accumulate to health-threatening levels.  ERM has conducted more than 100 IAQ surveys in schools, offices, public and industrial buildings.  Five survey projects are described in the literature.

LITERATURE PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES IN
BROWNFIELDS

</H3>

<!-- text -->
EXTON, Pa. -- June 21, 1996 -- New literature entitled "<I>Brownfields: New Approaches to Asset Management</I>" is now available from the Environmental Resources Management (ERM) Group.  The literature identifies why brownfields programs are emerging, how they work, why they represent a major opportunity for business and - most important - who can benefit from brownfields now.
<p>	"Brownfields" are abandoned, idled or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.  Brownfields programs are new approaches to site assessment and clean-up designed to encourage redevelopment of brownfields sites while still protecting health and the environment.
<p>	To obtain a copy of <I>Brownfields: New Approaches to Asset Management</I>, contact Gregory Lloyd, Marketing Communications Department, ERM Group, 855 Springdale Drive, Exton, PA  19341, at 800-544-3117 or fax 610-524-3866.

<b>Accidental Release 112 (r)</b> - Under Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, both OSHA and EPA must regulate facilities that handle extremely hazardous substances.  OSHA is accomplishing this activity through its Process Safety Management (PSM) program, while EPA has just released its new regulations addressing Risk Management Programs (RMPs).  ERM will provide attendees with the information needed to determine their likelihood of having to comply with the RMP and then the tasks necessary to comply with the OSHA and EPA programs, including the preparation of the off-site consequence analysis.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><FONT SIZE="+3">G</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">REETINGS.</FONT></B>  This is the first ERM Group Annual Report.  It has been prepared primarily for our 274 shareholders; however, we also hope it will be of value to our employees, strategic partners, suppliers, clients and prospective clients.  It contains an overview of ERM's operations for the year, highlighting our wide variety of clients, the services we offer, their geographic distribution and our financial performance. <P>
Financially, 1996 was a good year.  ERM remains at or near the top of the industry in terms of revenues and profits.  Gross revenue grew by three percent in 1996 to $283 million.   According to <I>Engineering News
Record (ENR)</I>, we advanced from the 27th largest consulting engineering firm to the 25th, with most of our growth coming from the Asia/Pacific, South American and European segments of our business.  Profit margins remained high with increases in Europe and Asia/Pacific offsetting a slight decline in North America. <P>
It is clear that the environmental consulting industry is in a worldwide transition that began in the early 1990s.  Some traditional service sectors are maturing particularly in the U.S. and in parts of Western Europe and Australia.  However, new opportunities are arising as increasing emphasis is placed on improving our environment.  In Asia, Central America and South America, there is growing demand for many of our services.  Our clients also have become more sophisticated and discerning with respect to value.  Many are concerned with sustainable development and are looking to compete in an environmentally responsible way.  They also are embracing global, independently certifiable standards for quality and performance, and they expect their suppliers to do so.  It is important to recognize that even in the markets where we are most established and are the most mature, we have less than a five percent share.  That means there is plenty of opportunity for growth by adapting our capabilities to serve clients in more creative and value added ways.  <P>
We started two businesses last year and opened several new offices.   The new businesses are Fusion Staffing Services, which offers temporary and permanent staff to the environmental industry, and the Strategic Chemical Management Group, which reduces costs and environmental concerns for clients by arranging strategic sourcing of chemicals  and services through vendor alliances.  Our new offices are in China, India, Australia, Germany, Mexico, the U.S. and Chile.<P>
We have begun ISO certification for all ERM offices.  It has been achieved in several locations worldwide, and we expect the rest of our offices to be certified by the end of 1997.<P>
Last year we took an important step forward in assessing what lies ahead in the global environmental market by initiating a major strategic planning process, which we called "Vision 2000".  Every company within the ERM Group was involved in establishing goals for our businesses worldwide and in determining the strategies we are going to adopt to achieve those goals over the next five years.<P>
Fundamental to the success of our strategy are the values that we have always considered  important.  The changes in the environmental market today reaffirm that the values we have emphasized since ERM's inception are the correct ones &#139; and we plan to stay with them.  They include:<P>
<ul> 
     <li>employee ownership<P>
     <li>decentralized and empowered management<P>
     <li>an entrepreneurial culture<P>
     <li>investing in technology<P>
     <li>offering clients a full range of services from a single source<P>
     <li>developing new services to meet changing client needs<P>
     <li>providing service globally <P>
     <li>emphasizing quality and service<P>
</ul>

Vision, core values and a market-driven strategy are only part of the reason for ERM's success.  The other crucial element is our people - and we have some of the best in the world.  I want to thank all our employees, managers and shareholders who worked hard last year to serve our clients with creativity and dedication.  Judging from the satisfaction expressed by many of our clients, all of you deserve credit for frequently exceeding their expectations.<P>
We can say with assurance that we are one of the world's leading environmental
occupational health and safety consulting groups.  We have a lead, but we must not be complacent.  We need to ensure our clients benefit from our collective skills and experience by continuing to improve our ability to work as a team. We must continue to work intelligently, creatively and with dedication to give our clients what they deserve - the very best in service and value.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he breathtaking rate of economic growth in much of Asia and the environmental sophistication of mature markets such as Australia are creating tremendous opportunities for ERM to serve its clients. Revenues from the region rose briskly during the 1996 fiscal year, up 25 percent from the previous year.  Over the next three years, ERM expects revenues from Asia/Pacific to at least double.<P>

During the year, ERM added five offices in Asia and Australia and increased the total number of employees to more than 200. Today ERM is the most geographically diverse consulting group in the area, with offices in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Taiwan, two each in India and China, and six in Australia. <P>

ERM's services in Asia/Pacific also expanded during the year. Established consulting, engineering and project planning expertise was augmented in a number of the offices by new capabilities and products such as the company's Environmental Quality Manager (EQM) software, consulting on corporate environmental management systems that meet ISO 14000 standards, and specialized disciplines including acoustics, risk assessment and health and safety programs.<P>

In the Asia/Pacific region, ERM's strategy is to identify local requirements of major companies whom ERM already serves as a consultant elsewhere in the world, thereby "cross-selling" services to these established clients wherever they may operate. Investment  in information technology to strengthen collaboration and internal communication and to create new products for clients is another major component of ERM's strategy here. <P>
<BR>
<B><KBD>Asian Offices Expand</KBD></B><P>
ERM's extensive Asian network added offices in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Bangkok, Thailand; Singapore; and Madras, India, during the year.  Furthermore, the Hong Kong, China and Taiwan offices have established formal links to jointly develop and staff  business opportunities in the burgeoning Chinese market.<P>

Major new projects spanned a wide range, illustrating the breadth of services available from ERM in Asia.  The International Policy Services unit of ERM, for example, was commissioned by the Asian Development Bank and the United Nations to produce the 1995 edition of <I>State of the Environment for Asia and the Pacific.</I> It is a primary source of environmental information for the region and was used at a ministerial conference held in November 1995. Hong Kong Electric hired ERM's Hong Kong office to recommend a site for a proposed new 6000MW power station.<P>

Work undertaken in Hong Kong also included a study of marine habitats and commercial fishing operations designed to improve the management of fisheries resources, and a U.S. $1 million waste reduction study.  This study, probably the most comprehensive and detailed of its kind in the world, will form the basis of Hong Kong's waste management strategy well into the 21st century. <P>
<BR>
<B><KBD> Chinese Markets Grow</KBD></B><P>
In the People's Republic of China, ERM performed several substantial assignments for projects funded by multinational industry and foreign aid agencies: studying water quality regulations in Qingdao Municipality; analyzing market mechanisms for the control of air pollution in Jinan, Shangdong Province; and conducting training on audits and environmental management systems for the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in Beijing and Shanghai.  For a major U.K. power company, ERM reviewed regulations and enforcement in China's power sector.  In China, international companies are far more likely to be cited for environmental liabilities than local enterprises, so ERM also published a guide called <I>Pollution Control in the People's Republic of China: Regulations and Reality.</I>  It discusses major environmental laws and how to navigate China's environmental protection bureaucracy.<P>

The third player in ERM's "greater China" triumvirate is ERM's office in Taiwan, which was founded six years ago.  Gross revenue during the 1996 fiscal year jumped 95 percent over the prior period, due primarily to two large engineering projects.  The first was to design, install and commission a waste-water treatment plant being constructed in Shanghai by a multinational building products company. The second was the remediation of a site contaminated by heavy metals in northern Taiwan for which ERM performed the site  investigation, feasibility study and remediation in only four months.
<P>
ERM's office in New Delhi, India, jumped from two to twelve employees during the year, and a new branch office was opened in Madras.  The New Delhi office worked on a plan to strengthen environmental performance at operating plants for the electricity board of the State of Maharashtra, which 
has a population of 283 million.  The company also participated in a solid waste management study for the Madras Metro-politan Development Authority, and conducted a number of environmental audits for corporate clients.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE="+3">E</FONT>RM's consultancies in Europe work with clients from virtually every industrial category, international donor agencies and all levels of government on highly diverse assignments.  The European practice is founded on a broad range of environmental and risk-related services.  In addition, ERM is helping a number of large global corporations put in place environmental management systems that will enable them to participate in the voluntary international standards of ISO 14000 or Europe's Eco
Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). <P>
Despite the maturing market in Europe, revenues from ERM operations have increased by 11 percent in the 1996 fiscal year over the previous year.<P>
ERM's network in Europe totals 18 offices, including one opened in Stuttgart, Germany, in early 1996 to strengthen the company's presence in that highly industrialized region.  There are four offices in the U.K., two each in Italy and Germany, and one each in Belgium, France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Spain. Together they employ more than 280 people.<P>
<BR>
<B><KBD> Serving Multinationals</KBD></B><P>
The extensive European organization enables ERM to fulfill its 
commitment to serve its multinational clients wherever they 
operate.  The strength of ERM's interdependent network was demonstrated when the General Electric Company chose ERM in the U.K. for a global Master Services Agreement for all regions outside the U.S.  Similarly, a major European multinational packaging company commissioned ERM to assist with a two-year environmental health and safety compliance audit program for some 140 sites in Europe and North America.  ERM is able to provide a single point of contact to manage these multi-country assignments, which clients find very effective. <P>
ERM offices frequently carry out projects jointly.  In Mauritius, for example, professionals from the U.K. and the U.S. are developing, with World Bank funding, the island's first sanitary landfill.  Offices in India and Germany are working together on a large-scale environmental impact assessment for an automotive plant in Tamil Nadu, India.  The Spanish and U.K. offices collaborated on audits of industrial plants and gas exploration wells for two clients.  And ERM offices in France and Germany offered a joint workshop on environmental training issues in Alsace for TRW, the global automotive parts manufacturer.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE="+3">E</FONT>
RM's operations in North America grew market share during fiscal year 1996, in spite of a small decrease in gross revenues, by profiting from accelerating demand in Mexico and a larger share of the relatively mature market in the U.S. and Canada.  The ranking of all U.S. consulting engineering firms by revenue published by <I>Engineering News-Record (ENR)</I> showed ERM moving from 27th to 25th place for 1995.  ERM's North American offices achieved this by focusing on serving the regulated community &#139; primarily businesses and certain federal agencies &#139; and offering a full range of high quality environmental services. <P>
During fiscal year 1996, ERM added North American offices in Bakersfield, California; Tallahassee, Florida; Davenport, Iowa; Baltimore, Maryland; Rochester, New York; and Monterrey, Mexico. By year end, there were two offices in Mexico, one in Canada and 62 in the U.S.<P>
<BR>
 <B><KBD> Growth in Mexico</KBD></B><P>
Many multinational corporations already served by ERM elsewhere increased their investments in Mexico following the peso devaluation in December 1994.  This pushed the growth rate for ERM's revenues in Mexico into double digits.  By the end of fiscal year 1996, ERM had a four-person office in Monterrey, the country's second largest industrial region, and an office in Mexico City with twelve employees. ERM also serves clients in Mexico from its offices in the U.S., particularly Texas.<P>
The bulk of ERM's current assignments in Mexico are site assessments and permit applications for new facilities being developed by multinationals and large local businesses.  During the 1996 fiscal year, ERM prepared the strategic environmental management plan, environmental impact assessment and risk studies for a new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic plant, the first of five being built in Altamira by a multinational petrochemical company.  The permits were obtained in a record 35 days after applying.  ERM's offices in Mexico and London jointly conducted a market survey for hazardous waste generation in the central area of Mexico for a multinational waste management company, as part of justification for constructing a treatment plant.  The project is moving forward, and ERM in Mexico is preparing the environmental impact statement and risk assessments for the new facility.<P>
The market for environmental services in Mexico is expected to expand much faster than the U.S. market over the next decade.  As it does, ERM expects to add more offices and services in Mexico to meet the needs of industry. <P>

<FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT> he market for environmental services in South America has been growing by more than eight percent a year.  ERM is capitalizing on this growth through its local offices which understand the customs and economies of their countries and can apply this knowledge for multinational corporate clients. <P>
ERM has been expanding its environmental capabilities in South America to bring new services that are difficult to obtain in the region.  Typically, South American environmental consultants offer environmental impact assessments (EIAs), but not the contaminated site remediation, corrective action
or environmental management system services that ERM provides. <P>
ERM's strategy resulted in revenue growth of 21 percent in South America during the 1996 fiscal year, accompanied by a healthy increase in profitability. The firm expects revenues to increase by 30 percent in the 1997 fiscal year with the startup of a new office in Chile, and 20 percent annual revenue growth thereafter as individual national economies improve and international trade increases.<P>
<BR>
<B><KBD> Good Growth Prospects </KBD></B><P>
ERM began operating in Brazil in 1993 when it acquired an interest in a S&atilde;o Paulo environmental consulting firm that was renamed SEMCO-ERM do Brasil Ltda. ERM's office in Chile was launched at the beginning of 1996 because that country has a stable economy, healthy industrial growth and strong potential for expanding ERM's environmental services throughout Spanish-speaking South America.  ERM also has registered branch offices in Argentina, Ecuador and Peru and has worked recently in every major South American country except Paraguay.  Many of ERM's Brazilian technical staff of environmental engineers, biologists, geologists and geographers are trilingual, speaking Portuguese, Spanish and English.  <P>
ERM has completed projects in South America for large industrial concerns, national governments, and international donor agencies.  Significant projects during the past year involved environmental due diligence and transaction-related studies, including one for the acquisition of South America's largest paint manufacturer by a British company.  This project required ERM to assess seven sites in 25 days in four countries &#139; Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Bolivia.  Another major multinational brewery retained ERM to conduct, together with the company's audit team, due diligence studies of more than 15 facilities throughout Brazil and Argentina.  Altogether,  ERM has conducted more than 100 audits and due diligence assignments  throughout South America.<P>
<BR>
<B><KBD> Remediation Services </KBD></B><P>
Contaminated site investigation and remediation are ERM's newest services in South America and the ones with the greatest growth potential. ERM's office in Brazil was retained to conduct a site investigation and decontamination of a former asbestos manufacturing plant in S&atilde;o Paulo.  ERM's asbestos abatement plan allowed a global retailer to proceed with construction of a major new store in record time.  <P>
ERM also developed a complete decontamination program for a battery manufacturing facility in Brazil.  In the Amazon jungle region of Ecuador, a multinational petroleum exploration and development company retained ERM to act as its third-party arbitrator for any dispute that may arise with the Ecuadorian Ministry of Energy & Mines regarding site cleanups.  <P>
EIAs are a basic environmental service provided by ERM, which began work at the beginning of 1996 on an EIA for an oil and gas project in Peru.  This EIA was conducted for another multinational petroleum company.  In Brazil, ERM is assessing leaking underground storage tanks at gas stations for the same company.<P>
In the area of training in environmental management and pollution control, ERM conducted a $450,000 eight
day course for Petrobras, the state-owned oil company in Brazil.  The training included all areas of environmental management &#139; EIAs, risk management, environmental economics, emergency planning, international standards, clean technologies and waste treatment.<P>
<BR>
<B><KBD> EMS Awards </KBD></B><P>
During the 1996 fiscal year, ERM participated with <I>Gazeta Mercantil</I>, the major Brazilian financial newspaper, in a special series of articles on EMS. The articles appeared in eight weekly newspaper supplements devoted to environmental management systems.  Businesses were asked to complete a questionnaire about their EMS.  ERM evaluated the responses and selected the top 25 candidates for awards given by the newspaper.  <P>
In Chile, ERM is helping to strengthen the national environmental ministry under a contract from the British Overseas Development Administration, and is managing the Environmental Pollution Prevention Program (EP3) funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development to promote waste minimization and source reduction.  <BR>

<FONT SIZE="+3">A</FONT>s environmental managers, consultants, engineers and scientists, ERM carries out assignments throughout the world as unique and diverse as our growing client base.  At any time during the past year, several thousand projects were underway for a broad range of companies and governmental organizations.  Since ERM was founded, we have completed projects in more than 160 countries and for almost every industry sector from chemical manufacturing to transport engineering.<P>
This section of the Annual Report shows the scope and variety of projects during
fiscal year 1996; from analyzing the waste management needs of Hong Kong in the next century, to transforming a contaminated rail yard in Sacramento, California into houses, shops and offices, to helping the U.K. Department of Trade and Industry assess the impact of potential legislation on industry.<P>
ERM has grown by adapting to changes in the global environmental marketplace
We expect to continue to grow in the years ahead by serving the rapidly developing economies in Asia and South America, and by meeting the demands of the more mature markets in Europe and North America.  Our success is a result of our 
commitment to serving our clients responsively and well. As we move into the larger, more competitive environmental market of the twenty-first century, that commitment remains our top concern.<P>

<B>ERM Foundation Projects</B> 
<BR>
The following are summaries of projects ERM Foundation has funded and provided in-kind volunteer support.
</FONT>

<p>
<B>Water for People</B>
<p>
Support was requested for programs in six Latin American countries (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Bolivia) designed to obtain and sustain drinking water and sanitation services for local communities.  There was an opportunity for ERM employee participation through the offering of technical services connected with these and similar projects.  WFP leveraged ERM contributions by using them to obtain other donations to assist in these projects.  ERM's Mexican offices were used to help facilitate ERM staff participation.  For more information contact Project Director John McGlennon <A HREF="/alert/locate/statelist.html#Massachusetts">(ERM, Boston, MA)</A> at 617-742-8228.
<p>
<B>Rotary International for Las Animas (Mexico) Clean Water Project </B>
<p>
Las Animas, a town of approximately 6,000 people located 30 miles from Mexico City, currently obtains its drinking water from two nearby wells that are contaminated and have high bacterial counts.  In addition, the current system is only capable of providing the water to half the town on alternative days.  To address these problems, this project includes the design, procurement, installation, start-up and O & M training for a water chlorination system for the town.  The system will be designed to make maximum use of existing water system infrastructure such as existing water storage tanks (2), the existing water collection system and the existing water distribution system.  ERM and FUNDEA have completed a feasibility study  on this new system.  Currently, requested funding will go toward implementation, start-up and O&M training.  Rotary International will match the gift.  The Project Manager is Brian Flynn, <A HREF="/alert/locate/statelist.html#Colorado">(ERM, Denver, CO)</A> at 303-741-5050.
<p>
<B> National Forest Foundation Youth Camps </B>
<p>
National Forest Camps are eight week programs held at national forests, including Pike National Forest (CO), George Washington National Forest (VA),and Gifford Pinchot National Forest (WA).  During the camps, inner city young people ages 15-19, who come from unsupportive environments, work and learn practical skills related to conserving and sustaining natural resources.  They are fully supervised and counseled and receive minimum wages for their efforts.  They construct shelters, fences, trails and stone walls.  They clear trails and streams.  As a result of this program, several inner city youth are now enrolled on scholarships studying environmental fields and others who are still in high school, plan to enroll.  This program has a high potential to reshape lives.  For more information contact Project Manager Judy Hushon <A HREF="/alert/locate/statelist.html#Virginia">(ERM, McLean, VA)</A> at 703-734-9327.
<p>
<B> National Forest Foundation Urban Tree House </B>
<p>
Urban Tree Houses are wooden, porch-like decks located in a park in disadvantaged neighborhoods.  Local teachers and other offer activities on the importance of natural resources to elementary aged children at the Tree House.  The first Urban Tree House was built last year in Atlanta, GA.  Others are being added in Washington, D.C., Portland, OR, Salt Lake City, UT, Baton Rouge, LA and in Nashville and Franklin, TN.  The Project Manager is Glenn Taylor <A HREF="/alert/locate/statelist.html#Georgia">(ERM, Atlanta, GA)</A> at 770-590-8393.
<p>
<B> The Einstein Project, Brown County, Wisconsin </B>
<p>
This project requested support to help develop education materials and training for teachers in the Brown County area.  The teachers, in turn, will incorporate a hands-on educational program in the sciences at their respective schools.  We recommended that the materials developed for this program be transferred to other school systems within the state and throughout the United States.  Two educational programs proposed will fit well into the Foundation's objectivesRocks & Minerals and Water & Land.    The Project Manager is Jim Polich <A HREF="/alert/locate/statelist.html#Illinois">(ERM, Chicago, IL)</A> at 708-940-7200.

<H4>
Keeping the quest for the perfect from driving out the good. </H4>

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>ypically, ERM works 
on behalf of industry, helping it comply with state or U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules and regulations. But when Greg Verret, a principal of ERM in St. Charles, Mo., was contacted by the Can Manufacturers' Institute (CMI) in Washington, D.C., in the fall of 
1992, he realized that the project in question would 
be a little different.
<p> 
<IMG SRC="/gif/blue.gif">
<br>
The assignment was twofold: (1) to work with CMI to find a way for the EPA to maintain its capture efficiency standards for 
surface coating lines, while (2) simultaneously getting the EPA's OK on a new, 
easier and less costly way 
for industry to comply with those standards. 		
<p>
While unusual, the assignment didn't put the regulators and the regulated into different camps. Both CMI and ERM had worked with the EPA before in situations where the goal had been to keep the quest for the perfect from driving out the good. If this was going to work, Verret knew, they would have to create a win-win situation. At issue was the phrase "capture efficiency" and how it could best be measured in the surface coating industries. There are many kinds of 
surface coating lines in U.S. industry, and all of them are subject to environmental 
regulation no matter where the finish is applieda final destination that includes virtually every kind of product from automobiles to office furnishings, appliances to cans.
<p>	
Every year, in fact, U.S. manufacturers produce 125 billion food and beverage cans. CMI represents the approximately 28 companies with 200 plants across the U.S. that make about 95 percent of those cans. To protect canned food and beverage products from interacting with the steel or aluminum 
of the cans themselves, cans receive either a solvent- or water-based coating, whichto make for even dispersalin some instances contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in excess of EPA-established standards, requiring the use of add-on 
controls. In addition, VOCs are often used to clean impression rollers on the line. Not all VOCs are toxic, but most contribute to the buildup of atmospheric ozone. Manufacturers, therefore, are required by the EPA to remove a significant percentage of the VOCs being released by these coating lines, and to calculate and report to the EPA the amount of VOCs being captured. 
<p>	
The method historically used to make that determination was called mass balance testing: Weigh the VOCs fed to the process; then, at the end of the process, weigh what's been captured by the 
control device. The difference between the two is fugitive emissionsescapees from the system. Typically, can manufacturers are required to keep 
fugitive emissions at around 10 to 15 percent, which means they strive for a capture efficiency ratio in excess of 85 percent.
<p>	
All well and good, except that the EPA was concerned about imprecision 
in mass balance testing (standard deviations from the mean wavered from 0.4% to 27.9%with an average of 10%) and the potential for upward bias in the results it generated (more than 40% 
of individual runs indicated capture efficiencies of more than 100%, a physical impossibility). By the mid-1980s, the EPA was working on an alternative measuring methodologytotal temporary enclosure (TTE) testing. Here, for as long as a test took, an airtight enclosure would be built around a surface coating station, different technology would be used, and greater accuracy would be achieved. In 1988, the EPA issued guidance for TTE testing for magnetic tape coatingand in 1990, as a result of the Chicago area's failure to achieve national air quality standards for ozone, the EPA's implementation plan there included TTE guidance.
	<p>
Industry was unhappy. So were some state agencies. And so were some EPA regional offices. Total temporary enclosures could do the job, but the costs would be prohibitive. These enclosures, which are a little larger than the average Winnebago, had to be custom-designed, installed, operated and then dismantled. That took time. And necessitated shutting down the production line. 
<p>
In some cases, adjacent lines would have to be shut down as well. The TTE test was two hours longer than the old mass balance method and required more equipment, like flame ionization analyzers. CMI, on behalf of its members, began searching for some way around, or between, the horns of the capture-efficiency dilemma. 
<p>	
The EPA, meanwhile, announced it would undertake a year-long study to review possible alternative capture efficiency test methods. It postponed the deadlines for TTE compliance certification. That was when CMI called ERM. Could the environmental consulting firm find a way to make mass balance testing more accurate, run a field study to demonstrate it, and then convince the EPA to change its regulations to accommodate the new methodology?
<p>	
Verret said yes. ERM 
had done similar work in 
the past. "So, basically, we had a methodology in place," he says. "All we had to do was refine itfind a combination of ways to reduce measurement errors." The old mass balance method cost about $5,800 per test series. The TTE method, ERM calculated, could cost up to $80,000. That, CMI 
calculated, amounted to 
$17 million extra for a single round of tests for the canning industry alone. 
<p>
Verret, along with ERM team members Michael Price, senior engineer, and Michael Woodbury, senior project scientist, got to work. By February 1993, they had 
a prototype of what would become known as enhanced mass balance testing in place at a CMI member 
company in Philadelphia. They used highly accurate, certified, instantaneous-measurement scales to 
measure the starting and ending weights of coating in the feed drums and draw buckets, as well as the before and after weights of the roll solvent reservoir buckets; they measured total liquid-phase VOC consumption by analyzing individual samples from the coating and roll wash solvent feed reservoirs at the start and end of each run; and they used a flame ionization analyzer to measure background VOCs captured by the coater hoods and the curing oven. 	
<p>	
All in all, they found more than half a dozen 
different ways to make the mass balance method reliable. It cost nearly twice as much as the old method ($10,200 per three-run test series), but was still about eight times less than the TTE method. By October 1993, ERM and CMI had their report ready for review by the EPA. The project was ready to move out of the field study phase and into the negotiation phase.
<p>	
Verret knew the process would be difficult. But it was what the job was all about. "I found it very challenging and a lot of fun to work 
on," he says, "because we'd come up with a potential answer and the EPA would ask for revisions and after more research, we'd come back with a better solution. It forced us to think on our feet. And eventually, they accepted the major thrust 
of our argument." Overall, he says, "we had good 
cooperation among EPA, CMI and ERM. The EPA was just as interested as we were in finding a good alternative to TTE."
<p>
In January 1995 the 
EPA issued its revised guidance for capture efficiency testing for surface coating lines. The revision did not include the ERM-developed protocol, 
but it did say manufacturers could use other testing methods than TTE as long as they met minimum 
standards of precisionwhat the EPA terms the Data Quality Objective and Lower Confidence Limit standards. The ERM-developed protocol meets those standards. And, says Verret, "We came up with some additional protocols to further enhance 
the enhanced mass balance method. This could be important from a cost-
effectiveness perspective, becausealthough what we developed with CMI and the EPA worksthese additional protocols cut down the length of individual test runs as well as the number of test runs required to get reliable results. And that translates to dollars."

<B>Self-disclosure best policy, EPA says</B>
<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=10 HSPACE=20 SRC="/gif/flam.gif">
<br>
<br>
<FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he EPA has released in the form of non-binding guidance its final enforcement policy regarding disposition of voluntarily discovered and self-disclosed violations a guidance the agency is considering codifying as regulation. The policy, which went into effect January 22, reiterates the EPA's objections to the establishment of self-audit privileges.
<br clear=all>

The policy offers three benefits to self-disclosing companies:
<ul>
	<li>The EPA will not seek gravity-based penalties for self-disclosed violations discovered through an environmental audit or qualified environmental management system. Violations discovered through other means can receive a 75% reduction in gravity-based penalties.
<p>
	<li>The EPA will not recommend criminal penalties against companies that so self-disclose, provided there was no prevalent management philosophy or practice that concealed or condoned violations, and that no high-level company officials or managers were consciously involved in or willfully blind to the violations.
<p>	
	<li>The EPA will not request or use an audit report to initiate an investigation, although it may request such reports if it has independent reason to believe that a violation has occurred.
</ul>
<p>	
For a self-disclosing company to be eligible for these benefits it must meet a series of conditions, set forth here in highly abbreviated form.
<p>	
The violation must not be a repetition of the same or similar violation within the past three years, must not have caused harm or the threat of harm to humans or the environment, must not violate the terms of a court order or consent agreement, must be discovered voluntarily (that is, prior to receiving an inspection notice or information request or citizen suit notice) either through an environmental audit or other procedure reflecting due diligence; and must be disclosed in writing to the EPA within 10 days, and then certified as corrected (including any EPA-recommended remedial 
measures) within 60 days. Further, the company must agree in writing to take preventive measures, and must cooperate with the EPA. 
<p>

analysis of the policy, please

(610) 524-3441.

This company set out to improve the environment
one production team at a time.
</H4>

<FONT SIZE=+3>H</FONT>ow can a company cut costs, and improve its public image, while integrating environmental issues into its long-term planning at the earliest stage of the processwithout costly investments or operational interruptions? The Performance Materials Division 
of Schuller International, a leading manufacturer, found a way. By focusing on aggressive environmental management rather than just trying to keep in compliance, the company initiated a revolutionary 
environmental program possibly the first of its kindthat has begun 
a sweeping change in 
its operations.
<p>

<TABLE CELLPADDING=5>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
To get the shift under way, Schuller asked Environmental Resources Management (ERM), in Denver, CO, to visit one of its plants and evaluate the environmental aspects and impacts of its manufacturing process. The benchmark portion of the study was to determine just how Schuller's management systems compared to the criteria in ISO 14000 draft standards. 
<p>
Says ERM principal Don Malotte, "They wanted us 
to engineer not just the process by which they managed and controlled the environmental aspects and impacts of their production linebut also, in effect, 
to help them change the philosophy and the attitude that their production teams brought to the job each day." 
<p>

It was an unusualmaybe uniqueassignment. "We're aware of no other project," says ERM's project leader Mick Bilney, "where a management system assessment has been combined with an environmental aspects review and impacts assessment process. The client wanted us to identify operational impacts, including exposures and risks. This may be the first time it's been done in this country, perhaps in the world. The client realized that this identification process would be crucial to future planning, and asked us to help effect a paradigm shift with regard to its 
facilities approach to 
environmental issues. We did it."
<p>
Malotte and the team took the work through four phases, starting with an exhaustive review of all the plant's historic environmental management documentation. This allowed them to get a clear idea not only of the underlying issues involving Schuller's plant operation, but also to locate gaps in the company's existing approaches to environmental issues. Here, and at every stage of the job, ERM worked closely with Schuller, sharing preliminary impressions of findings. This helped to avoid misinterpretation and, more importantly, kept communications open between the team and the client. By incorporating the input of Schuller's facility personnel into the program's design, ERM helped to ensure its success. 
<p>
Next came in-depth, guided interviews with every personfrom corporate level to facility levelwho had any sort of environmental responsibility. Team member Mark Curran, from ERM in Walnut Creek, CA, developed the initial questionnaire incorporating Federal Sentencing Guidelines and ISO 14000 draft standards. Paul Nazaryk, a regulatory 
specialist at ERM in Denver, refined the questionnaire further and made it more user-friendly.
<p>
In Phase III, ERM's team members integrated ISO 14000 standards and their own industrial experience into the program's design. In addition, the operational flow was assessed and a cross-section of plant workers was interviewed. 

<TABLE ALIGN=RIGHT>
<CAPTION ALIGN=BOTTOM><B>Mallotte</B></CAPTION>
<TR><TD>
<IMG SRC="/gif/mallotte.gif">
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<p>
Finally, the findings were analyzed and consolidated into a draft report that organized Schuller's environmental management systems assessment efforts around six critical issues: 
<ul>
<li> Environmental policies and goals
<li> Assignment of staff responsibilities and goals
<li> Standard operating procedures
<li> Training, record-keeping, documentation and communication
<li> Internal evaluation and reporting
<li> Environmental management systems resources.
</ul>
<p>
The immediate result? Acceptance by Schuller of nearly all management review findings and recommendations as sound and on target. ERM presented the essence of the draft report to Schuller's environmental staff in a training workshop held in conjunction with Schuller's annual environmental conference. 
<p>
Using ERM's recommendations as a starting point, Schuller then developed several standards and goals for continuous improvement, including: 
<ul>
<li> Integrating environmental goals into business planning
<li> Performing self-assessments to measure performance
<li> Constructing an annual report describing successes and new challenges in the environmental area
<li> Communicating key issues to employees and fostering new and improved communication links between employees and management to improve environmental performance
<li> Developing and improving accountability 
of employees through 
continuous training
<li> Setting goals and 
targets for continuously improving efforts at pollution prevention, waste minimization, energy efficiency and resource conservation.
<p>
In the longer term, ERM's program will be used by Schuller as a mechanism to measure and improve performance at other facilities. And the Performance Materials Division has been told that it is Schuller's new corporate leaderthe flagshipin environmental management. Observes the division's environmental manager, Kurt Bratton, "From their response to our RFP onward, ERM shared our vision. But then they developed the tools we needed to implement the vision. <p> 
Now we're getting calls from other divisions to find out what we're doing. We'll start the new year with a bang. Now, the hard work begins."

<B>Introducing the Do-It-Yourself Audit</B>
<P>

<FONT SIZE="+3">C</FONT>leaning up is one thing. Planning for 
it and keeping track of it is another. It would be ideal for plant managers to have a little help from a user-friendly source that literally becomes part of the internal team, monitoring environmental, health and safety (EHS) conditions and offering suggestions for improvement.
<p>
Unfortunately, not every company can afford a group of consultants capable of doing that.
<p> 
That is where ERM's AUDITpower program comes in. The software quickly becomes a member of the team, providing an easy-to-use, Windows-compatible solution to a variety of EHS problems. The entire auditing process is covered, from checklist development through the finished report. AUDITpower assists in the design of audit checklists, the gathering of relevant data, the formatting of information and the printing of reports. Unlike other, less flexible programs, AUDITpower allows you to create your own checklists or to customize those that come with the system. 
<p>
The checklists cover 14 topics, including hazardous materials, air emissions, OSHA manufacturing, OSHA construction, solid waste and ISO 9000. Each of the checklists helps to identify EHS management issues and provides guidance for improvement. All checklists come complete with questions, answer options, aid notes, guide notes and more. The checklists are available for individual topics or as a package.  Every quarter, those lists are updated, reflecting requirement changes. 
<p>
Once you've decided on the checklist content and organization you want, you're free to go into the field, entering data. As you walk the site, your final report is being formatted from the data that you enter. In addition, AUDITpower has its own word processing program built in, enabling users to work with the document 
on screen before printing. You're not trapped in any particular format; in fact, you can reformat for your own convenience.
<p>
Finally, AUDITpower allows you to raise and check off red flags quickly, to get to the heart of compliance issues. Print your red flags and you have a non-compliance report, the first step in a corrective action plan.
<p>
One of the most powerful aspects of AUDITpower 
is that it turns the audit process into a learning process. In fact, just reviewing the check lists as stand-alones is a great reference for any potential compliance issue. No matter how you choose to use it, AUDITpower allows you to do it yourselfand learn the easy way.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT>or two decades Dynamic Ceramics had been spray-painting glaze on the lamps it manufactured. The glaze contained lead, which had been picked up by the plant's ventilation system and circulated throughout. Lead was everywhere; so was asbestos. When the company decided to move its operations after 20 years at the same California location, a due diligence audit revealed substantial environmental, health and safety problems at the site.
<p>
As the company closed down its operations and prepared to terminate its lease, it had to satisfy both the owner of the property and the state environmental agency that all environmental problems had been mitigated. Dynamic was obligated to continue paying rent on the now-non-income-producing property at the rate of $3,000 a day. The company's deep pockets were getting shallower with each tick of the clock, and Dynamic knew it was important to get this work done, and quickly. 
<p>
It was a huge joband one made even more formidable by its complexity. Each remedial task was interrelated, so that as one problem was tackled, it changed the nature of others. The company needed integrated solutions that could be implemented quickly and cost-effectively. 
After a number of $3,000-days went by, Dynamic decided to terminate its relationship with its then-consultant. Simultaneously, Dynamic's law firm, which had worked with ERM and knew its reputation, asked ERM in Irvine, Calif., to come in.
<p>
"The other consultant just didn't have an overall objective," says ERM's 
Wallid Kazi, project director on the Dynamic Ceramic job. "What distinguished us was that we were able to look at the big pictureto see the trees and the forest at the same time. Also, we were very clear about what our mission was because we were very clear about the client's need. The purpose of everything that 
had gone on before our involvement, and that which we were called upon to accomplish, was to get that lease exit agreement for Dynamic. It focused our thinking. We were able to ask ourselves, as we went into our planning and decision-making process, what strategy would best achieve that end."
<p>
ERM's first step was to design and install a perimeter air monitoring program for the entire facility. With lead and asbestos present, 
it was important to identify potential health hazards to the surrounding community and to the project staff. The air monitoring program gave Kazi and his team the information they needed to design the comprehensive lead and asbestos abatement programs that would be central to their mitigation efforts. They called in subcontractors and managed the work. The roof, for instance, had been sprayed with lead-based paint. It had to be removed and disposed of safely. Lead dust was everywhere inside the 200,000-square-foot building; ERM pressure-washed the walls and floors and used special vacuums to clean the air. A preliminary risk assessment showed particulate lead levels in the building's air above those allowed by California's Proposition 65. Under that law there were two choices: clean up, or post signs advising of the hazard.
<p>
Kazi knew it was 
physically impossible to eliminate the minute lead particles from the air. In this case, cleanup would mean a complete demolition and removal of the facilitya very expensive proposition. But the alternative, a Prop 65 warning, would put Dynamic at substantial risk for future claims based on the presence of airborne lead dust. To many, Prop 65 postings are nothing more than invitations to sue. 
<p>
Kazi called in Bruce Molholt, a toxicology 
specialist and a world-renowned figure in risk assessment, from ERM in Exton, Pa. Kazi and Molholt analyzed the bioavailability factors to assess risk potential. Bioavailability is based on the principle that normally harmful materials, such as lead, are not always biologically available to the human body, depending on the form in which the materials exist. The lead dust they had found was in a silicate forma form that cannot be absorbed by humans. Moreover, Kazi knew, the human lung naturally refuses particles of the size that existed in the building. Using these two criteriasize and bioavailabilityERM's team was able to convince both the regulatory agency and a risk assessment expert from 
the owner's side that the lead in the building did not pose a risk requiring a Prop 65 warning. "This was probably the first time the local agency had ever accepted such an argument," says Kazi. It meant the client wouldn't have to pay for complete demolition and removal 
of the facility.
<p>
Kazi says three things distinguished ERM in 
its efforts on behalf of Dynamic Ceramics. First was the ability to see the big picture and tackle complicated, interrelated tasks. Second, "we were able to do what needed to be done in a timely and cost-effective manner."
<p> 
And finally, Kazi says, "we have considerable depth of experience in working with regulatory agencies. You have to realize that even if another contractor had done the job and done it well, the job wouldn't be over until the regulatory agency said it was over. We recognize that. Working with the 
regulatory agency, being familiar with their procedures and having their respect going in, was just as important to this client as cleaning up the yard. 
<p>
For them, every day of delay was another $3,000, no matter whether they were waiting for the last load of contaminants to 
be hauled away or for a regulator to get to his in box. I guess what I'm 
saying is, we were able to finish the job, completely. And most important, the client is satisfied."

<B>Advanced Fluidized Composting 
System Results in Lower Costs 
and 95% Less Sludge</B>
<P>

<FONT SIZE="+3">E</FONT>RM's Advanced Fluidized CompostingSM (AFC) system is a unique process technology for treating high-strength (up to 60,000 ppm and greater, Chemical Oxygen Demand) organic waste streams and sludges. Unlike traditional biological treatment systems, which produce large amounts of sludge, AFC reduces sludge by 95%, and with lower costs. Now it's online full-scale at a remediation site in New Jersey. Another installation (intended for the treatment of dairy wastes) is soon to be constructed 
in Pennsylvania, and 
two other systemsin Holland, Michigan, and Baltimore, Marylandare undergoing engineering evaluation. 
<p>
The patented technology combines thermophilic biological treatment with 
a proprietary chemical treatment step. The thermophilic biological treatment is the essence of composting: Bacteria that thrive at high temperatures (110-160 F) work to decompose the stream, creating heat (and, thus, their appropriate environment) along the way. 
<p>
What distinguishes 
the ERM approach is the chemical treatment step that breaks down any refractory elements not already broken down by the biological system. The chemically treated wastes are then recirculated through the system for biological treatment.
<p>
The process, 
says senior program director Mark J. Krupka, is "very cost- effective compared to other systems, and it generates less sludgein the range of little to none."
<p>
Waste streams on which the AFC technology has been successfully applied include:
<ul>
<li> High-strength organic acids
<li> Fermentation broths
<li> Solvents
<li> Viscose fiber sludges
<li> Waste activated sludges
<li> High-strength methanol streams
<li> High-strength nitrate streams
<li> Phenolic streams
<li> Cosmetic wastes with high fats, oils and greases (FOG)
<li> Dairy wastes with high FOG
<li> Food processing wastes.
</ul>
<p>

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>henever ABC Products of New England conducted a health and safety audit at its cosmetic formulating and packaging facilities, it spotted problems. The same kinds of problems, over and over again. So ABC would clean up the problems, get in compliance, wait for the next audit, and then  clean up again. Meanwhile, and more importantly, it was being hit with accidents, days lost to injury and equipment problems.
<p>
For four years ABC had been working with ERM in Albany, NY, on a variety of projects, only one of them a health and safety audit. By the time ABC asked ERM's Jim Testo and Jane Whitehouse to come in prior 
to a second audit, the company's patience with being perpetually out of grace had worn very thin. 
<p>
"What they wanted," recalls Testo, director of environmental health and safety for ERM, "was to reduce accidents and injuries. I told them that another audit would just produce another list of problems because they hadn't taken any steps to change things to stop the problems from happening. That's when the meeting got interesting."
<p>
Testo and Whitehouse were fortunate to have had a client who was willing to do something beyond dotting the i's and crossing the t's of the letter of the law. The approach ERM developedlooking beyond the regulatory checklist at the entire scope of a facility's operationsworked not only for ABC Products but, over the next year and a half, for other New York and New England clientsincluding one with a major facility in India. Good ideas spread quickly, and widely.
<p>
The approach they developed began with a conference with the top management of ABCa session designed to learn exactly what the client's goals were. ERM worked with the company to develop a reporting system that would enable the company to identify and take action against the root causes of its problems, whether those causes turned out to be design-based or management-based.
<p>
This was followed by the risk assessment audits themselves, and, shortly thereafter, by a closing 
conference with facility managers. The closing conference was crucialthe forum in which ERM was able to present its findings, orally and in hard copy, 
to the people who would 
be responsible for taking corrective action. The 
hard-copy findings were presented on the specially designed task sheets the ERM team had developed at their initial meeting with management.
<p>
The task sheet was created to provide fast identification of each specific problemtwo pages maximum, one page when possible. "This way," says Jane Whitehouse, who is a manager of environmental health and safety for ERM, "managers don't have to plow through 40 or 50 sheets of prose just to find out what their issues are."
<p>
Or how to fix them. "Instead of being merely a communication of what's wrong," says Testo, "the task sheet provides a functional, systematic approach to fixing the problem. Root-cause analysis is old hat, but presenting it as we did is something new."
<p>
The task sheet encourages auditors to minimize words and get to the point concerning a number of parameters:
<ul>
<li> Type of risk: personal injury or illness/property damage
<li> Probability
<li> Severity
<li> Immediate corrective action
<li> Root cause identification
<li> Managed solution
</ul>
<p>
The Probability and Severity sections allow auditors to assess the likelihood and the consequencesincluding the financial onesshould an event occur.
<p>
Additionally, the Immediate Corrective Action box provides a space in which auditors can provide a cost estimate for initiating the action. 
<p>
The last three items on the page have accountability built in: spaces for facility managers to sign and date when they have taken the appropriate remedial steps.
ERM used a digital imaging camera to photograph each of the health 
or safety problems it identified. Digital cameras don't use film, so there are no negatives; security was ensured simply by turning the camera's digital data disk over to the client. 
The resulting photographs became powerful learning tools for those members 
of the management team who might not have recognized the risk associated with a particular finding 
or condition.
<p>
During February, March and April of 1994, ERM sent two people to each of half a dozen ABC Products facilities in several states. The ERM auditors, however, required more than a familiarity with the regulatory requirements appropriate to each facility. Since they were delving for problems beyond those covered by regulations, they had to be expert in a variety of areas. To identify risks for each facility, for instance, they had to know the appropriate life safety codes, building codes, recommended industry practices, and best management practices. 
<p>
The cost of ERM's new, comprehensive approach? Including all labor, travel and expenses, about the same, says Testo, "as a 
typical health and safety audit where we know what we're looking for and where there's no extensive travel.
"Couple that kind 
of cost efficiency," Testo continues, "with the extremely fast turnaround time we deliveredplus the closing conference where we walked them through our findings task sheet by task sheet, enabling them to pick up the ball immediatelyand we've got a happy client."
<p>
ABC Products' vice president for risk management concurs, noting that in the first half-year after the audits were completed, ABC Products experienced a 24 percent reduction in worker's compensation claims. Moreover, he 
anticipates future benefitsincluding reduced costs associated with lost work days, medical claims, worker's compensation, property damage, product loss and litigation.
<p>
The success of Whitehouse and Testo and their ERM team has not gone unnoticed at home, either. They were the winners of ERM's 1995 Excellence Award in the Health and Safety category.

<H4>When a manufacturing firm faced an emissions 
control evaluation that would have taken tons of time and money, it was BACT to the drawing board.</H4>

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>ll regulators have one thing in common: the power to regulate. But how they apply it may vary. A regulator, like an auditor 
for the IRS, may ask very little from a company
or enough to strain its resources for weeks.
<p>	
Take the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) of a midwestern state. It wanted Anon 
Corporation (not its real name), a vehicle body manufacturer, to evaluate its surface coating (painting) processes to ensure that the best available control technology (BACT) was being used to limit emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Anon had four major coating lines in two different buildings that would require BACT analysis. 
<p>	
Typicallyas set forth in the back of the U.S. EPA's HAP manualBACT analysis is a step-by-step procedure which tracks emission flow rates, temperatures, and contaminant concentrations. It's a fill-in-the-blanks pencil-and-paper 
calculation involving the identification, quantification and processing of dozens 
of variables. Ultimately, it evaluates the cost-effectiveness of applying emission controls to a pollutant stream. Then, if a permitting authority like SEPA determines that the cost of controlling the emissions is reasonable, it has the power to require those controls. 	
<p>	
In the Anon case, however, the SEPA representative wanted more than an evaluation of VOCs in the single main exhaust header for each line. He demanded that each of the small exhaust streams feeding into those main exhaust headers be evaluated. And not just individually, but 
in every possible combinationa "what if" analysis that strained the bounds of "what if," requiring more than 50 evaluations. Using then-traditional methods, it would have cost in the neighborhood of $300,000. 
<p>	
Anon called ERM, Inc. for help.
<p>	
With engineering understatement, Steve Cox, a member of the ERM team assigned to the project, described the challenge: "It was clear that a more efficient method of performing BACT analyses was needed for this project."
<p>	
The team at ERM, Inc. (which also included Russ Zeckner) decided the best way to go forward was to go backwardto rewrite the book. "The key here," Cox recalls, "is that if you have a single source emission and a regulator you can work with, thenas antiquated as it sounds
the pencil and paper method really is the most efficient way of doing the job. But that wasn't the case with Anon Corp."
<p>	
Instead of trying to make existing approaches more cost-effective, the ERM, Inc. team decided 
to develop a completely new, high-speed, computer-based BACT analysis 
system, working both 
with EPA cost-estimating procedures and control-technology suppliers to develop cost algorithms 
for their new approach. They dubbed their finished product "Fast-BACT."
<p>	
The way Fast-BACT works, the user fills out an input sheet that includes all of the parameters and costs relevant to the construction and operation of an emissions control system. Then, using macros, Fast-BACT generates report-quality costing worksheets, tables and graphs for whichever 
of the following control technologies is appropriate: thermal incineration; catalytic thermal incineration; thermal regenerative incineration; catalytic regeneration incineration; carbon adsorption; or adsorption/
oxidation. 
<p>	
"At the push of a 
button you can select 
up to 20 different report-format outputs," says Cox. 
<p>
"Everything from the input table which contains all the defining parameters, to the calculations used for each control technology, to a summary cost table that compares the annual operating costs of the different control technologies. Or 
the same comparisons in graph format."
<p>	
Performance of 
Fast-BACT exceeded expectations and, ultimately, obtained the approval of SEPA's bureaucratic scrutiny. Says Cox: "After the regulator saw how quickly we were able to address all of his questions, he started wondering about the calculations set up by the U.S. EPA in the first place. By the time the process was over, the scientist who wrote the original manual had to write letters defending it." 
<p>	
Fast-BACT is not just fast. It greatly diminishes the possibility of a computational error, and it 
provides clear consistent 
documentation of every step of the analysis. It also comes in at about one-third the cost of traditional 
BACT analysis. 
<p>	
Just as significant, it 
is a technology that can be (and has been) duplicated and is now taking hold across the ERM Group on behalf of a wide variety of clients who need BACT analyses performed in order to be in compliance with state and federal clean air standards. One of the best testimonials to the new process: Since the development of Fast-BACT, Anon Corporation itself has 
come to ERM with some $200,000 of additional 
business. 
<p>	
And if that isn't 
testimonial enough, Cox, 
and the team received ERM's first Excellence Award in the Air Quality Category for innovation, quality improvement, cost savings to clients, and a good application of technology. Cox's reaction? As close as an engineer gets to gushing: "We were elated."

<B>Small facilities to be judged on 
actual, not potential, emissions.</B>
<P>

<B>THE NEWS:</B>
<p>	
The EPA has issued a two-year interim policy on "Potential to Emit" that could ease the compliance burden of a significant number of U.S. facilities subject to Title V of the Clean Air Act as amended.

<p>
<B>THE BACKGROUND:</B>
<p>	
Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, applicability of the Title V operating permit program and most other air quality requirements is usually determined by a facility's potential to emit air 
pollutants, not its actual emissions. Thus, a large number of relatively small facilitieseven though their actual emissions are lowwould appear to be subject to a "major source" classification, because their potential to emit pollutants is great, based on the assumption that a facility operates 8,760 hours a year at full capacity. Under these standards, standby equipment, for example, could be included in the equation, thus making an otherwise small source appear major.
<p>
<B>WHAT THE INTERIM
POLICY DOES:</B>
<p>	
The new two-year interim policy exempts sources from the standards set by the 1990 amendments. It allows sources to limit their potential emissions through state permits or through keeping records. Thus, "major source" classification under the Title V Operating Permit and Hazardous Air Pollutant programs would be avoided.
<p>	
The interim policy was issued in order to give state regulators time to extend permanent exemption from the requirements to some of these smaller source facilities.
<p>
<B>TO FIND OUT MORE:</B>
<p>	
EPA outlined their transition policy in a 
guidance memo published on January 25, 1995. Copies can be obtained from the EPA Technology Transfer Network bulletin board (919-541-5742).

<P>

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued the proposed HWIR that will exempt certain low risk, listed hazardous wastes from regulation under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).  The proposed rule applies to listed hazardous wastes, mixtures of listed hazardous wastes and solid waste, and residues derived from the treatment, storage, or disposal of listed hazardous wastes.
<p>
The proposed rule establishes risk-based concentration levels for specific constituents, called exit levels, that must be met before a waste may be exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste.  Listed waste that exhibits any characteristic, however, will continue to be regulated as a hazardous waste until the characteristic is removed.  Generators who wish to claim a waste as exempt must follow a specific exemption process.
<p>
The final version of the rule will be applicable in states without RCRA delegation; RCRA authorized states are not required to adopt consistent regulations.
<p>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><KBD> Key Features: </KBD></FONT>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Sets Subtitle C exit levels for 376 constituents.
<p>
<li>Designed to be self-implementing.
<p>
<li>Specifies exemption requirements for sampling, analysis, reporting, record- keeping, and public participation; failure to meet these requirements voids the proposed exemptions.
<p>
<li>Sets different risk-based exit levels for waste waters and non-waste waters.
<p>
<li>Requests comments on five conditional management options that could result in higher exit level concentrations.
<p>
<li>Based on a new multi-pathway risk analysis that includes direct and indirect potential exposures via ground water, surface water, air, and soil.
<p>
<li>Encourages pollution prevention to avoid Subtitle C.
<p>
<li>Provides incentive to develop innovative treatment technologies.
<p>
</ul>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><KBD> Application </KBD></FONT>
<p>

<ul>
<li>Facilities generating or managing listed wastes with consistently low RCRA constituent concentrations.
<p>
<li>Facilities with available Subtitle D disposal facilities may be able to achieve contingent management.
<p>
<li>TSD facilities may have to amend their waste analysis plans; permitted facilities in unauthorized states should submit a Class I permit modification.
<p>
<li>Units receiving only newly exempted wastes could trigger closure requirements.
<p>
<li>By definition, wastes meeting the exit criteria at the point of generation are not subject to Land Disposal Restrictions (LDRs).
<p>
<li>The proposed exit levels for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are deemed protective of the environment even where they exceed current RCRA air emission standards.
<p>
<li>CERCLA release notification of wastes exempted under the rule may no longer be necessary.
<p>
<li>Federal RCRA management requirements may no longer be applicable as CERCLA Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARARs).
<p>
<li>The exemption applies to hazardous debris and media with constituent concentrations below the exit levels.  However, USEPA or authorized states may still make site-specific determinations of whether media "contains" a RCRA hazardous waste when concentrations are higher or lower than the proposed exit levels.  (The upcoming contaminated media rule will include a "bright line", which will define when hazardous contaminated media will be subject to a modified Subtitle C or more site-specific standards to be implemented by the states.)

<P>

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a proposed rule that is intended to minimize remediation disincentives by creating more flexible management standards for contaminated media and wastes generated during site cleanups.
<p>
The proposal gives EPA and authorized states the ability to exempt low risk, contaminated media from RCRA Subtitle C regulation.  The proposal does not exempt the media from Land Disposal Restriction (LDR), but modifies requirements for higher risk media and allows for site-specific exemptions for low risk media.  The proposal also includes Subtitle C exemptions for navigational dredged sediments managed under the Clean Water Act or the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act.
<p>
The proposal applies to excavated media regulated as hazardous waste due to a hazardous characteristic or to contamination with a listed hazardous waste.  It does not apply to debris, sludges or other non-media wastes.  The proposal does not address what should be cleaned up, "how clean is clean" or remedy selection.
<p>
The proposal sets "Bright Line" levels for soils and groundwater which differentiate between high risk and lower risk contaminated media.  Media with constituents below the "Bright Line"  could be exempted from RCRA Subtitle C if managed under approved site-specific controls.  For media with constituents at or above any "Bright Line" level, new HWIR-media treatment standards would apply.  Existing RCRA regulations pertinent to treatment, storage, and disposal would continue to apply.
<p>
To become authorized, states must certify to EPA that their base programs are equivalent to the federal program.  Until authorization, existing requirements will remain in effect.
<p>
EPA is requesting comment on other alternatives including industry's proposed Unitary Approach that exempts all cleanup wastes from Subtitle C and does not include "Bright Lines" or new treatment standards.  EPA is also requesting comment on any combination of options and believes there is enough information in the record to pursue a different approach without having to repropose the rule.
<p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Will be an integral part of the Subpart S (RCRA Sections 3004[u] and 3004[v]) rulemaking.
<p>
<li>Will replace Corrective Action Management Unit (CAMU) regulations but grandfathers existing CAMUs.
<p>
<li>Does not address the temporary exclusion from the Toxicity Characteristic (TC) rule for petroleum contaminated media and debris generated from underground storage tank (UST) cleanups.
<p>
<li>Covers the TC suspension for non-UST petroleum contaminated media.
<p>
<li>Proposed HWIR-waste exit levels are higher (less conservative) than 27% of the soil "Bright Lines" and 20% of the groundwater "Bright Lines." EPA recognizes that this inconsistency must be addressed before promulgation.
<p>
<li>Creates separate state HWIR-media authorization that can be withdrawn without endangering the entire RCRA delegation.

<P>



The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued Subpart CC which will regulate organic air emissions from tanks, surface impoundments, and containers.  The rule potentially affects any facility that currently generates or manages organic containing hazardous wastes, including less than 90-day storage areas at large quantity generators.  The applicability threshold is whether a hazardous waste contains greater than 100 ppm (by weight) of volatile organic compounds.  EPA has specified several new test methods for determining the VOC content.  Each facility is required to make an initial waste determination, which includes multiple samples, however, averaging of results is allowed over time.  
<p>
Affected facilities are required to either: 1) develop a storage system which meets an exemption; 2) implement specified storage methods or uses certain containers; or 3) install controls which provide to 95% removal.  The compliance date has been postponed by EPA to June 5, 1996.  If the air emission control requirements cannot be put into operation by June 5, 1996, then the facility must provide an implementation schedule by then with the ultimate deadline being December 8, 1997.

Phase III Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) Rule 
</H3>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><KBD>Introduction</KBD></FONT>
<P>


In their continuing effort to develop and implement the RCRA land disposal restrictions (LDR), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed the Phase III rule which covers a wide array of topics that were not addressed in previous LDR rulemakings or have since been modified.  
<p>
A primary focus of the rulemaking was to establish concentration-based treatment standards for underlying hazardous constituents in ignitable, corrosive, reactive, and toxicity characteristic wastes (other than D004-D011) managed in CWA, CWA-equivalent, and Class I underground injection well (SDWA/UIC)) systems.  However, EPA recognized that by allowing dilution to be used to "decharacterize" ignitable, corrosive, and reactive characteristic wastes, the requirements and intent of the LDR program could be circumvented.  Specifically, the treatment of underlying hazardous constituents in characteristic wastes by means of dilution does not remove the hazardous constituents, as intended by the LDR program, but simply lowers the concentration.  Therefore, EPA proposed that underlying hazardous constituents in characteristic wastes at the point of generation must be treated (not diluted) to universal treatment standards (UTS) or existing CWA standards/limitations prior to being land disposed.  (Note that EPA is recognizing existing CWA limitations and standards as RCRA-equivalent standards).
<p>
EPA also established treatment standards for 67 newly listed wastes including: spent aluminum pot liners (K088); organobromine wastes (K140 and U408); and carbamate wastes (K156-K161, and 58 RPS and RUS listed wastes).  In addition, the UTS promulgated under Phase II was modified to include 43 additional hazardous constituents associated with the newly listed wastes, 1 wastewater and 12 non-wastewater standards that were not established previously in Phase II, and concentration-based standards for two waste codes (P003, P056) that were previously treatment method standards.

Phase IV LDR 40 CFR 268 

</H3>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><KBD>Introduction</KBD></FONT>
<P>

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has proposed the final portion of the Land Disposal Restrictions program.  The major elements of this Phase IV proposal would regulate cross-media contaminant transport from Subtitle D surface impoundments due to air, water, or solids releases.  The rule would also establish treatment standards for sludge containing hazardous constituents in those impoundments.  In general, this proposal would apply to any clean water act systems which are managing ignitable, corrosive, or toxic hazardous wastes as a component of the waste stream.
<p>
The proposal does not include regulatory language, but rather includes a discussion of three options EPA is considering to promulgate.  The options provide a range of emission control methods, and varying degrees of overlap with other regulatory programs.  They range from relying on existing programs (e.g. RCRA LDR Phase III, Clean Air Act, etc.) for adequate environmental protection, to requiring specific mass removal equivalency to the Universal Treatment Standards (UTS) at the point of waste generation before it enters the impoundment.

NJDEP DER 
Open Market 
Trading Program
</H3>

<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><KBD>Introduction</KBD></FONT>
<P>
On 1 July 1996 the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) promulgated a new VOC and NOx air pollution control program (Subchapter 30) which embraces the concepts contained in the USEPA model open market trading rule.  The new program provides facilities with the opportunity to implement pollution prevention, mobile source or conventional air pollution controls to generate discrete emissions reduction (DER) credits for sale or cost-effectively use in meeting emission control requirements on other emission sources.  A DER represents a 
tradeable/saleable quantity of actual emissions reductions that occurs at a source during a specific generation period which are below its lowest allowable emission rate.  The smallest quantity 
of a DER is one-twentieth of a ton (0.05 tons).  Subchapter 30 describes, in detail, requirements 
for the generation, use, transfer, verification, notification and certification of DERs. NJDEP's open market trading rule is a chance to add value to your air pollution control program.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><KBD> Key Features of the DER Program</KBD></FONT>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A unique environmental regulatory program to provide facilities with an opportunity to meet ongoing VOC and NOx control requirements more cost- effectively.<p>
<li>Implementation of the program is through generation of  discrete 
emissions reduction (DER) credits.<p>
<li>A DER represents a tradable/salable quantity of actual emissions reductions below a source's allowable emission rate.<p>
<li>DERs can be used to:  generate savings/revenues,  meet existing air pollution control requirements and satisfy emission "offset" requirements.<p>
</ul>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><KBD>Generation and Use of DERs</KBD></FONT>
<p>
NJDEP has not prescribed DER generation strategies, anticipating new and innovative approaches. However, the following types of activitie, might be used to generate DERs:
<ul>
<li>reduce mobile source activity<p>
<li>implement energy conservation activities<p>
<li>carry out pollution prevention activities<p>
<li"over-control" existing sources of emissions<p>
</ul>
DERs can be used for:
<ul>
<li>sale (any other facility within New Jersey)<p>
<li>meeting emission limitations for a source at the same facility<p>
<li>meeting emission limitations for a source at a different facility<p>
</ul>
Upon use, 10% of DERs must be retired.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><KBD>Benefits to DER Participants</KBD></FONT>
<p>
Although facilities are not required to participate in the open market trading program, this is an unique strategic compliance opportunity. Participation in the program can provide:
<ul>
<li>an opportunity to meet on-going VOC and/or NOx control requirements while reducing compliance cost;<p>
<li>a facility or company-wide air pollution control program which allows for the most cost-effective air pollution control solutions to address growth and process changes; and<p>
<li>the most cost-effective emission reduction strategy(s) across several operations and locations.<p>
</ul>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><KBD>Introduction</KBD></FONT>
<P>
Under Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, both OSHA and EPA must regulate facilities that handle extremely hazardous substances.  OSHA is accomplishing this activity through its Process Safety Management (PSM) program, while EPA will soon release its new regulation addressing Risk Management Programs (RMPs).  While details of EPA's program are still emerging (Federal Register notice of 31 January 1994 details the applicability requirements), with a final rule scheduled for 24 March 1996, the time to determine applicability and develop cost-effective compliance strategies is now.  Environmental Resources Management (ERM), Inc. has developed a manual that can assist your facility in determining the likelihood of having to comply with the RMP and then "walks" you through the tasks necessary to comply with the OSHA and EPA programs, including the preparation of the off-site consequence analysis.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><KBD> ERM Can Help </KBD></FONT>
<P>
ERM, Inc. can put our expertise to work for you by assisting you the following areas:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a customized program and manual to ensure that your response to the OSHA and EPA programs is cost-effective and integrated.
<p>
<li>Assist you in developing the hazard assessments under different release scenarios for your facility.
<p>
<li>Perform screening level hazard assessments and an off-site consequence analysis to identify the need for early community presentations, and then develop a "public awareness" campaign for you.
<p>
<li>Develop modeling scenarios that can be applied to multiple facilities in different locations within the same corporation.
<p>
<li>Develop strategies and use your Title V permit, if possible, to avoid the new EPA RMP program.
If you need assistance in any of these areas or with other environmental challenges, use the attached fax sheet or call Pete Charrington at 
(610) 524-3431 in Exton, PA.
<p>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><KBD> Key Features: </KBD></FONT>
<p>
<li>Affected facilities will have to prepare a hazard assessment which evaluates the potential effects of an accidental release of any of 140 regulated substances.
<p>
<li>Facilities will need to conduct worst-case release scenario analyses (based on a 10-minute release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process failure under worst case meteorological conditions) in order to prepare an off-site consequence analysis.  The results/impacts must be disclosed to the public.
<p>
<li>EPA is evaluating the applicability determination based on phased, or tiered approach. Facilities will be subject to RMP requirements based upon such things as the number of employees, whether or not a release would have any impact on the public, five-year accident history, etc.

Many hospitals in Delaware will be required to file an application for a new operating permit with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).  DNREC's new permit program, adopted in response to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, became effective on 
3 January 1996 and is designed to better control atmospheric emissions from institutional and industrial facilities in Delaware.  Any facility/hospital which has potential emissions of regulated pollutants greater than the "major source" thresholds will be required to submit a new operating permit application.  Institutions, including hospitals, are often major sources as a result of  their boiler or incinerator emissions.
<p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Facilities located in New Castle and Kent Counties must file for a permit if their emissions of a regulated pollutant potentially exceeds 25 tons per year or approximately 5 pounds per hour.  Facilities located in Sussex County must file a permit application if their emissions of a regulated pollutant exceeds 100 tons per year (the regulated pollutant of concern is oxides of nitrogen [NOx] generated by all combustion sources).
<p>
<li>DNREC has indicated that facilities which emit less than 150 tons per year (tpy) of regulated pollutants, which includes most hospitals, are required to submit a permit application no later than 3 July, 1996 while those emitting more than 150 tpy has to submit an operating permit by 3 January, 1997.

UPDATE: Ohio's Title V Program

</H3>
<P>

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) Title V Operating Permit Program is nearing its first "<B>call date</B>" of 30 November 1995.  Have you determined your facility's status?  If you have filed an Emissions Fee Report during 1995, you should have received a copy of the OEPA Title V software, STARShip, during September 1995.  If you did not receive a copy of the STARShip and you are a major source, your Title V application is still due by 1 October 1996 at the very latest and may be due by the end of this month.  Environmental Resources Management (ERM), Inc. has the staff available now to assist you in meeting your obligations.
<P><I><B> 
Summary of Significant Highlights of OEPA's Title V Operating Permit Program
</B></I><P>
<ul>
<li> OEPA received full final approval of its Title V Operating Permit Program (OAC 3745-77) on 1 October, 1995.  This starts the clock for the 90 day, 180 day, and one year submittal deadlines.
<p>
<li> OEPA is continuing to evaluate the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) 10 July 1995 memorandum titled "White Paper for Streamlined Development of Part 70 Permit Applications".  This important document provides guidance from USEPA to the state regulators on ways to simplify and streamline the Title V permit application package.  OEPA has attempted to implement much of the USEPA guidance into Ohio's Title V program in order to make the Title V permit application process less burdensome to industry.
<p>
<li> OEPA has developed a list of Trivial Sources (as defined in OEPA Engineering Guide #62) by incorporating the guidance in the USEPA "White Paper" and input received from the regulated community.  A cautionary note - if an applicable requirement exists for an emissions unit, then that emissions unit can not be classified as an insignificant or trivial source.
<p>
<li> OEPA has made available the final version of the Title V permit application software, STARShip.  Copies have been mailed to facilities filing Title V Emission Fee Reports in 1995.  Additionally, two-day hands-on computer training is available on a first-come, first-serve basis.
<p>
</ul>

UPDATE: Process Safety Management 
</H3>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You may know Environmental Resources Management (ERM), Inc. from our air, engineering, remediation, wastewater, information management or environmental quality management (EQM) services.  There is more - an eight-year history of effective Process Safety Management (PSM) 
support to clients.
<p>
By May 26 of this year, hundreds of companies were required to perform a self-audit of their OSHA Process Safety Management program (29 CFR 1910.119), retrain process operators and complete 50% of required process hazards analyses (PHAs).
<p>
If a facility has more than a specified amount of a highly hazardous chemical in a process, it is covered by the standard.  The facility does not have to be a chemical plant to be covered by the standard.  For example, breweries, food, pharmaceutical, paint, ink, floor tiles and explosives manufacturers can all be covered by the standard.  ERM professionals are currently working with most types of industry on PSM issues.
<p>
ERM's environmental, health and safety specialists have assisted clients in managing PSM programs since the first state regulations were promulgated in New Jersey and Delaware. 
We offer cost-effective and timely PSM auditing services; audits usually involve a visit of two
to four days.
<p>
ERM provides comprehensive written management programs, PHAs, piping and instrumentation drawings (P&IDs) and all other PSM engineering and management services.  Many of you are now considering how the EPA Title V Risk Management Program (RMP) requirement may apply to your chemical processes.  ERM is already providing companies like yours with integrated process safety/risk management services.
<p>
ERM believes that Process Safety Management and Risk Management Planning may be the most important environmental, health and safety topics of the 1990s and we are prepared
to apply our PS/RM experiences to your specific requirements.  Use the attached fax sheet
or call Joe Baker at (610) 524-3500 to let us know how we can assist you or provide
additional information.

INTRODUCTION<HR></H2> The Title V/Part 70 Operating Permit program currently
being implemented by permitting agencies nationwide has made facility compliance
with air pollution regulations more challenging and information-intensive
than ever before. The structure and content of Title V permit applications
demands much more than an emissions inventory-focused view of facility air
emissions. Electronic information management for Title V permit development
and management now requires access to complex information, addressing aspects
such as: actual and potential emissions for regulated and state pollutants;
multiple Operating Scenarios for operational flexibility; tracking of operational
and emissions limitations; Applicable Requirements (and non-applicable requirements)
and methods of compliance; detailed operational and materials usage information;
and compliance demonstrations and reporting. In addition, the information
management system needs the ability to generate custom reports to match
the format and content of the state Title V application; and of convenient
report modification to meet changes in the application forms.<BR>
<BR>
This paper describes the implementation of a facility-customizable electronic
air information management system for Title V permit development and management.
The information management system, named A*I*M*S-Title V, is an electronic
database developed by ERM-Northeast and customized in this work to support
Title V permit development efforts for two separate Rohm and Haas Company
chemical manufacturing facilities located in Bristol, Pennsylvania (Bristol
Plant) and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia Plant). The two facilities
had Title V permit application submission dates in November 1995, with the
application content for both facilities governed by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania's Title V Operating Permit Program. The A*I*M*S-Title V database
was customized for the Pennsylvania (PA) Title V program by ERM-Northeast
over the period June through August, 1995, following which the database
was implemented by the two facilities and supported the successful completion
and timely submission in November 1995 of their individual Title V applications.<BR>
<BR>
Subsequent sections of this paper provide a discussion of: the requirements
of an electronic information management system in order to adequately address
Title V permit development and management; the key aspects of the design
and development of the A*I*M*S-Title V database as a facility-customizable
permit development and management tool; and the customization of the database
to meet the PA Title V program structure. The implementation of the database
at the two Rohm and Haas facilities is then discussed, particularly with
regard to its contributions through the permit development process. The
facility commitment and investments required and the key experiences from
using an electronic database as a critical tool in the permit development
process and then subsequently as a &quot;permit manager&quot; are highlighted.
Finally, the continued development of the A*I*M*S-Title V database for other
facilities in several different states and some of the challenges currently
being addressed in that work are presented. <BR>

<H4></BLOCKQUOTE><A NAME="requirements"></A>REQUIREMENTS OF A TITLE V DATABASE<HR></H2> An electronic information management system for Title V must meet a number of requirements dictated by the potentially broad scope of the Title V air permitting program. Firstly, it must be recognized that no single/static database design can directly match all of the various individual state and local implementations of the Federal Part 70 Operating Permit program. The significant differences that exist between the structure and content of the over 100 different Title V programs implemented (or being implemented) throughout the U.S. pose the single most challenging requirement of a Title V database, that of having a universally applicable, and yet flexible enough structure that can readily accommodate each of the different Title V programs. Perhaps more important is the need for the database design to be able to readily respond to the seemingly unavoidable changes in structure and content of almost every state's Title V program as it evolves in time.

Content Requirements
<HR>Although each of the individual Title V programs is in a sense unique, there are a number of common content requirements that can be identified and highlighted. These content requirements for an electronic Title V database are categorized and discussed below.

Facility Data and Application Description. Facility-related information, including ownership, location, SIC codes, other identifying features and details regarding the facility is universally required, although in varying degrees, in all Title V permit applications. The type of Title V permit application constituting each submission by the facility, such as initial application, administrative amendment, revision, or renewal, is also universally required and must consequently be tracked and logged by the database.

Air Equipment Data. A variety of potentially detailed information on individual air equipment within the facility may be required to be compiled and reported in the Title V permit including, but not limited to, air emission source equipment, control devices and exhaust points. The information required addresses areas such as current air permit numbers and details; attributes such as location, equipment make and model, stack height and building heights, and installation and operation dates; operational and maintenance information, and the relationship (pollutant flow stream) between individual air equipment. In addition to the commonly recognized air equipment types, some Title V programs also introduce other types of &quot;air equipment&quot; such as production areas, process lines, and fuel storage locations. These other &quot;air equipment&quot; types must then be integrated with the commonly recognized air equipment to address the Title V program structure. For example, an emissions-producing reactor in a process line may be required to be grouped with other emissions-producing equipment such as a storage tank and a distillation unit into the process line and then reported as emission units within this emission group, although emissions/operational limitations and applicable requirements may apply to individual emissions-producing equipment and must be reported in that context.

Materials Usage and Non-Air Waste Disposal. The characteristics of the raw materials used and their usage rates within the facility are frequently an integral component of the Title V program in many states. The relevance of materials characteristics and usage rates comes into the picture through routes such as VOC content limits on process materials (e.g., surface coatings), fuel parameter specifications (e.g., Sulfur content), and limitations on hourly or annual fuel usage. The presence of Federally-regulated Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs), as well as state-defined toxic air contaminants as constituents of process input materials may also need to be identified for the purposes of the Title V application in some states. Although, the need to report non-air waste disposal mechanisms in the Title V permit is relatively uncommon, the need for such a waste tracking mechanism may be necessary for pollutant mass balances and emissions estimation.

Air Emissions Data. Air emissions data are an obviously critical component of the Title V permit application, with the need to track and report actual and potential emissions on an hourly and an annual basis (generally) from each emissions-producing source equipment. These emissions from individual sources also frequently need to be summed for facility-wide emissions reporting. Further, some Title V programs require the grouping and reporting of emissions from source equipment by production areas or process lines. In addition, some Title V programs additionally require reporting of emissions by stack or fugitive exhaust (emission) point. The various types of potential reporting requirements imply that the database design for storing emissions data must be sufficiently robust to handle the manipulations necessary to meet the requisite reporting formats. 

Operational Flexibility. Most states' Title V programs attempt to alleviate the potentially severe restrictions on a facility's operational flexibility imposed in a Title V permit through the use of Alternative Operational Scenarios (AOS). These AOS introduce a hierarchical, pyramid-like structure quality into the Title V application, since each emissions-producing source must have the ability to have any number of operational modes defined as individual AOS. Each AOS will have its own unique emissions estimates; pollutant flow streams in terms of the control devices and exhaust points involved; operational limitations; applicable requirements; and compliance terms.

Applicable Requirements (ARs) and Compliance Terms. The ability to comprehensively, and at the same time, flexibly address applicable requirements and compliance terms is undoubtedly the most critical aspect of electronic information management for Title V permit development and management. Applicable requirements must be capable of being defined, tracked, and reported by the database in a number of different variations. Examples of different types of ARs include numerical emission limits from individual regulations or existing permit conditions, that must then be integrated with the emissions compilation and reporting modules; ARs that apply to individual pollutants; ARs with facility-wide applicability; ARs with a number of different components, such as recordkeeping, testing and monitoring (e.g., sections within sub-parts of NSPS regulations); and ARs that involve non-numerical emissions limitations such as limits on materials characteristics (e.g., VOC content limits), usage rates or operational restrictions. Applicable requirements must be intimately integrated with compliance methods or terms that the facility is required to or will otherwise use to demonstrate compliance with each AR. Both the ARs and compliance terms have timelines and other related compliance dates among their key characteristics. Finally, some ARs must be tracked as non-applicable requirements.

Compliance Status and Plans. For each AR, the compliance status must be compiled and reported in the Title V application, and plans must be provided for achieving compliance with each individual AR currently in non-compliance. The Title V permit also involves the submission of periodic reports to demonstrate compliance with individual ARs, and the submission of these reports must occur according at a frequency and timetable established by each AR. The electronic database must therefore, at a minimum, be capable of compiling the information required to prepare the corresponding components of the application. The ability to prepare compliance plan schedules based on inputs to the plans would be additionally beneficial as a permit management tool. 

Other Permitting Components. Many Title V applications also includes provisions for other air permitting components such as &quot;capping&quot; or synthetic minor status; emissions trading and &quot;bubbles&quot;; Emissions Reductions Credits (ERCs); and Discrete Emissions Reductions (DERs). The ability to integrate all of these components into the electronic database design would add to the versatility of the database. 

Output Requirements
<HR>A fundamental output requirement of the electronic Title V database is that it have the ability to be readily customized to generate hard-copy paper outputs, and in some cases, electronic data file outputs that match the content and format of the state's Title V application forms. This requirement is particularly challenging because each Title V program has a unique set of application forms, and to make it even more of a challenge, the forms in many states have changed several times (sometimes quite substantially) as the program has evolved and/or was finalized. 

Facility/User Requirements
<HR>An electronic database for Title V permit development and management must be responsive to the needs of the environmental management and operational users at a facility. A key to ensuring responsiveness is a database design and program flow that is intuitive to a user with an air permitting background and perspective. This implies that the database design and functions must be based on an air permitting framework and must not be centered around either the software or any particular state's Title V program structure. The air permitting needs and thought-process of the facility environmental staff should be the key driver in the design of the database - not the pre-conceptions of the database programmer or the limitations of individual database software. In other words, the facility users should drive the database design and not the other way around.

A good Title V database design will avoid having the user jump through hoops to implement the database at the facility. Since Title V permitting is typically one of many responsibilities of environmental staff at most facilities, the database design must recognize that users have a limited amount of time and resources that they can commit to making the database a productive tool. Thus, minimizing the learning curve required for the database must be a primary design goal. Cumbersome user interfaces and repetitive data entry situations must be avoided. A modular design that allows users to selectively use and tap the segments of the database that best suit their individual needs and responsibilities is also important. The more complex the database is or is perceived to be, the less the likelihood that environmental staff at typical facilities will commit the requisite investment to make it function effectively. A Title V database must be focused and goal-oriented - a database that attempts to do too much and is as a result overly complex will not be accepted and assimilated as it must be in order to meet its goal of electronically developing a Title V permit.

The electronic Title V database must also allow the facility with maximum flexibility in developing its Title V permit. Examples of facility flexibility options include provisions for tracking emissions-producing equipment while expressly excluding them from the Title V permit application; as well as hypothetical operating scenarios for &quot;what-if&quot; evaluations that are not to be reported in the Title V permit.

The ability to connect with and share data from other electronic databases already existing at a facility, such as a materials safety data sheet (MSDS) database or operational logs will additionally aid the acceptance of a Title V database. The database must also have the inherent ability to address, even if only partially in some cases, environmental requirements additional to Title V permitting, such as SARA reporting, annual air emissions statements, etc. Closely related to these goals is the ability of the database to function as a Title V permit management tool, from generating compliance schedules, to watching for New Source Review triggers, to assisting with the semi-annual compliance statements required in the Title V permit.

Perhaps most important from a facility perspective, the Title V database cannot be a static tool - it must be a living, dynamic entity just as the Title V permit. This requirement implies that the database must be capable of significant modifications and additions that can be made at the facility-level without necessarily requiring the services of a specialist software programmer. 

Finally, the database must provide the ability to assign varying levels of user privileges to the database, with security mechanisms to prevent inadvertent modifications to data and program components, as well as tampering by unauthorized users.

NAME="design"></A>A*I*M*S-Title V DATABASE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION<HR></H2>The A*I*M*S-Title V database was developed by ERM-Northeast in response to the need for a facility-customized, electronic Title V permit development and management tool. The initial design of the database was driven by the key requirements discussed in the previous section of this paper, including the need for an air permitting based perspective to the database flow; responsiveness to facility and user needs; and the need for a universal yet flexible approach to address variations in Title V program structures and content requirements. The A*I*M*S-Title V database has some of its design origins in information management tools developed by ERM-Northeast over the last several years for site remediation, analytical information management, waste management, and storage tanks management. All of these tools have roots in facilitating facility environmental compliance and have undergone extensive facility exposure and testing. Additionally, these tools are characterized by their open architecture and their delivery to the facility as non-compiled software applications within their respective database software platforms. Each of these tools also emphasizes connectivity with other facility databases, and the site remediation database includes integration with a Geographic Information System (GIS) for graphical display and manipulations of database objects. Initial A*I*M*S-Title V database development was based on these databases through work conducted in-house and in customized applications for a U.S. Air Force base in Oklahoma and a large primary metals manufacturer in upstate New York. The A*I*M*S-Title V database has been designed as a application native to Microsoft Access( (Version 2.0), with an open architecture and relational database structure that is compatible with client-server database software such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and Sybase. Key database features include its delivery to a facility as a non-compiled application within Microsoft Access, providing maximum flexibility and opportunity for modifications to suit individual facility requirements. Microsoft Access( is a powerful, full-featured, and user-friendly PC-based database software package, and a member of the Microsoft Office( suite of applications for Windows 3.11 and Windows 95 operating systems. The Access environment permits import/export, connectivity, and cut-and-paste data transfer across multiple file formats and database engines including Excel, Lotus, ASCII text, dBase, FoxPro, Paradox, and other ODBC-databases. The A*I*M*S-Title V database can be customized with data tables, data entry forms and a suite of requisite output report templates that meet the initial needs of a facility and its Title V program requirements. As an non-compiled application within the Access( software environment, users can then readily add new tables, create new queries, and generate new custom reports to suit their evolving needs. Intimate knowledge of Access( is not, however, necessary for users to activate the customized database functions for which an intuitive user interface is provided. This approach to the database design addresses the key requirement of a user-friendly and dynamic database that is capable of evolving in time to meet changing user needs and requirements. Database Structure <HR>The A*I*M*S-Title V database utilizes a relational database design based on defining various types of database objects. These objects, named &quot;Air Objects&quot;, represent unique air permitting-related entities of relevance within the facility. Air Objects are typically those that are physically present at the facility, such as the Facility itself, Source Equipment; Control Equipment; and Emission Points. Air Objects are, however, not restricted to these types of commonly recognized objects and can include other physical and non-physical entities, as well as new user-defined objects. Each Air Object is uniquely characterized by several identifiers, including an Object Identifier Name; Object Type; and Inventory Year, and by its owner which is typically a Facility type Air Object for a particular Inventory Year. Through this structure, Title V information for multiple facilities and inventory years can be compiled within one database, although typically only one facility and inventory year may need to be stored in one copy of the database with other years archived or stored in different copies of the database. This design based on Air Objects in a relational database structure allows for universal applicability in a way that is not tied to any specific Title V program and can be readily adapted to a target Title V program. In a relational database, database records in individual tables are characterized by unique identifiers or &quot;keys&quot;. Based on these keys, different types of relationships, such as one-to-one and one-to-many, can be defined between corresponding fields in the records in different pairs of tables. These relationships then govern the order and nature of the data that can be placed in the various tables, and changes and deletions in one table can be easily updated throughout all tables containing related records. More importantly, using a relational database design allows information on individual Air Objects stored in different tables throughout the database to be easily found (queried) and reported. Thus, in the A*I*M*S-Title V database, information on the Applicable Requirements for an Air Object is stored in an Applicable Requirements table and is readily identified through the keys or identifiers of the Air Object which are used to tag each record in the table. Similarly, each record in the Compliance Methods table associated with a specific Applicable Requirement for a particular Air Object is tagged with not only the identifiers of the Air Object, but also the keys used to uniquely characterize each Applicable Requirement. This progression of relationships means that if a Compliance Methods report is required for the Air Object, it can be readily generated through a query of the Compliance Methods table by supplying the approach search criteria. This capability allows the database design to be universally compatible with different Title V programs (with minor modifications), and to be readily able to generate outputs that meet the layout and content of the various Title V application forms. Database Components <HR>Using the Air Object-based structure discussed previously, the database components address the following principal aspects: </BLOCKQUOTE>Descriptive Attributes of Air Objects, such as details of relevant facility characteristics; source equipment parameters; control device details; emission point information; as well as multiple record-type attributes such as control device efficiencies; Operating Conditions to represent multiple operational modes (scenarios) of individual source equipment Air Objects, tracking whether it is a primary or alternative operating scenario, the hours of operations, nature of operations, product or output generated, and materials usage rates; Emissions Streams linking the pollutant flow from source equipment through control devices to stack and fugitive emission points, that can be differentiated if necessary by a source's Operating Condition; Emissions Estimation module to estimate actual and potential, hourly and annual emissions by pollutant and by Operating Condition. Calculation methods include emission factors, operating and production parameters, materials usage and user-defined variables, and links to calculations in spreadsheets, together with information on calculation basis for each estimate; Applicable Requirements of Air Objects, tracked by Air Object and Operating Condition (for source equipment), and including the ability to track sub-sections of individual applicable requirements and their type (e.g., monitoring, recordkeeping, numerical emissions limitation, etc.), as well as rationale for determining applicability or non-applicability, and current compliance status. Numerical emissions limitations can also be viewed and entered through the Emissions Estimation module; Compliance Methods for each Air Object's defined Applicable Requirements, including detailed definitions of the type of compliance method, such as recordkeeping, reporting, workpractice, monitoring and testing, and their required schedules and frequency; Action Items for each Air Object, providing a means to track compliance-related and other needs and to enter compliance plans for non-compliant applicable requirements; Object Documents for each Air Object, providing a means of creating and embedding or linking to existing word processing, spreadsheets, CAD drawings, or other electronic files associated with the object. </UL>Data entry into these components is addressed using customized menus, intuitive forms, and event-driven functions. The database also includes the following lookup resource modules to assist in the data entry phase of Title V permit development: </BLOCKQUOTE>Chemicals reference list of over 600 pollutants, including names, regulatory applicability by Clean Air Act section and EPCRA/SARA, and limited chemical and physical property data; Materials Composition, for defining materials used and created (blended on-site) and characterizing their composition, either by direct input of composition data or through calculations based on blend fractions; Applicable Requirements, including descriptive information that is not specific to a particular source or emissions unit; Other lookup resource modules, including facility contacts, locations, and standard and alternative units of measure </UL>Information stored in lookup tables or resources is available for use throughout other parts of the database during data entry and can be continually updated to minimize repetitive data entry. Database Outputs <HR>Database outputs include a suite of template reports, including: </BLOCKQUOTE>Air Object Reports, which serve to mimic the data entry forms, and report information that has been input for each Air Object; Emission Inventory reports, providing tabulated emissions by pollutant, HAPs pollutants, and Title V fee pollutants, by facility and inventory year; &quot;What-If&quot; emissions comparisons, across Operating Conditions to determine maximum emission operating scenarios by pollutant; Applicable Requirements, Compliance, and Action Item reports of information entered by Air Object in the database; Permit Reports, which are customized to the particular state's Title V application forms. The Permit Reports can be accessed through a menu which lists the Title V application forms by section in accordance with the state's requirements. </UL>In addition to these template reports, the non-compiled nature of the database allows facility users to create new reports based on database tables and customized queries. Existing template queries can also be readily modified by users (with the requisite privileges assigned by the facility database administrator) to address circumstances such as minor (or even major) changes in the state Title V application forms.

NAME="customization"></A>PA CUSTOMIZATION AND FACILITY IMPLEMENTATION<HR></H2>The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (PA DEP) Title V Permit Application forms follow the general outline of Title V topics discussed previously, with a few key differences and additions. The PA program retained its existing new point source permit-to-construct structure (called &quot;Plan Approval&quot;) separate from the Title V application forms. Customization of the A*I*M*S-Title V database for the Rohm and Haas, Pennsylvania facilities consisted of three parts: (1) Structural changes and additions to meet the PA program and the unique air permitting needs of the two Rohm and Haas facilities; (2) Information content additions; and (3) Template reports to match each requisite section of the PA Title V application. In general, the PA Title V program structure was readily compatible with the Air Object-based structure of the database discussed previously. Several aspects of the PA Title V program structure of relevance to the customization included: </BLOCKQUOTE>Differentiation between Combustion and Process type emissions sources, with a somewhat different set of information requirements for each type; Tracking of Processing Steps for Process type emissions sources; Applicable Requirements reporting forms that did not need to be specifically &quot;speciated&quot;, by type of requirement (i.e., monitoring, emissions limit, etc.); &quot;Fuel Material Location&quot; module to track storage locations of fuel materials; &quot;Source Group&quot; module to track the grouping of emissions sources with common applicable requirements </UL>Several structural and content changes were also made to the database to reflect facility-specific needs. These changes included an option to disallow specific emission sources from being reported on the permit application; changes in data field types to allow greater flexibility in data inputs allowed; and provision of additional comment fields for internal facility purposes. Options to maximize flexibility in the facility's Title V permit were also included. For example, the Raw Materials Used information requirement for a Process type emissions sources can be filled either from materials usage data supplied for the source or entered generically by the user to preserve maximum permit flexibility. Facility Backgrounds and Title V Planning <HR>The Rohm and Haas Bristol Site is a diverse chemical manufacturing plant with a variety of continuous and batch type processes. Annual production is approximately 750 million pounds and is represented by over 800 products. In general, the plant specializes in various acrylate polymerization reactions to produce products such as emulsions, plastics, coatings, and resins. Adding to the complexity of the Bristol site, the facility contains three production areas, a utilities area (Powerhouse and Waste Water Treatment), a Research and Development facility, and a contiguous plant (also owned by Rohm and Haas). The Pennsylvania Title V regulations exempt R&amp;D facilities from Title V permitting, but its potential emissions must be aggregated with manufacturing to determine applicability. By comparison, the Rohm and Haas Philadelphia Site is smaller than the Bristol Site. The Philadelphia facility manufactures specialty chemicals for industry, water treatment, and agricultural use with an annual production of approximately one-tenth that of the Bristol plant. The Philadelphia facility contains seven diverse production buildings, a Powerhouse and a Wastewater Neutralization facility. Each facility formed a Title V team which had a team leader and a technical representative from each operating area of the plant as well as from Bristol's contiguous plant. The team worked on compiling the emission inventory, developing compliance strategies, performing compliance audits, and completing the Title V application forms. A consultant was hired to compile the list of applicable requirements for the site. The two team leaders worked closely so that strategies and methodologies were consistent between the two facilities. In 1994, each facility was subject to Pennsylvania's Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rules for VOCs and NOx. In preparation for submitting a RACT proposal, the plant developed a complete emissions inventory for VOCs and NOx. When it came time for Title V, the emission inventory used for RACT was expanded to include all other Title V regulated compounds. All of the RACT work was done using Excel(r) spreadsheets. The Bristol plant has on the order of 300 emission units, control devices and emission points and has 25 operating permits for those sources. The Philadelphia Plant has approximately 100 emission points with 10 operating permits for those sources. The Bristol Plant also has approximately 150 applicable requirements; the Philadelphia Plant has approximately 100 applicable requirements. The Philadelphia plant's regulatory requirements do not, however, reduce proportionately with size because the site has additional regulatory requirements from a local county agency, Air Management Services. Although both facilities had made use of the database features of the Excel spreadsheets for the RACT work, it became evident that a relational database was needed for Title V. Rohm and Haas reviewed a variety of commercially-available candidate databases for air compliance purposes, as well as the possibility of in-house database development. The criteria for the database selection included: </BLOCKQUOTE>Ability to fill out Title V Application forms directly from database; Compatibility with existing emission inventory and applicable requirement spreadsheets; Ability to act as the foundation for all air compliance issues, including Title V, SARA 313, Annual Air Emission Reporting, Annual Air Emission Fees, New Source Review, Plan Approval Program, and RACT; Cost and intuitiveness of use. </UL>A*I*M*S-Title V Database Implementation<HR>The Philadelphia and Bristol Plants jointly decided to implement a customized version of the A*I*M*S-Title V database because it met the first two selection criteria and had the potential to aid in the management of all air compliance programs. In preparation for implementation, all of the potential Rohm and Haas users of the database completed an 8-hour Microsoft Access training class and were trained on the actual A*I*M*S-Title V database for 4 hours. At the Bristol Plant, the database was populated by the team leader and corrections and modifications were made by all of the team members. This led to value-added application generation since the completed Title V Application numbered a total of 1,500 pages. Technical personnel's time was spent collecting, estimating, and documenting pertinent air compliance data without having to proof-read typed application forms. At the Philadelphia Plant, the database was populated, corrected, and modified by all team members including the team leader. The Philadelphia Plant's Title V application was approximately 750 pages in length. Experiences<HR>The implementation of a database for Title V and for future air compliance made the task of filling out the voluminous application forms a breeze. The database allowed our Title V effort to become more focused on our compliance strategies and operational flexibility. It has also paved the way for time and cost savings in preparing annual emission inventories, SARA 313 air emission compilation, and annual emission fees for reporting year 1995. When it comes time to update and amend our Title V application, the database will be invaluable again. Also, the Bristol Title V team will continue working through 1996 with the objectives of utilizing the database for compliance tracking, New Source Review, and the Pennsylvania Plan Approval process. At the Philadelphia Plant, the database was implemented in time to provide an audit tool for Compliance Certification. Audit forms including all applicable requirements, and their related Methods of Compliance were easily generated from the flexible A*I*M*S-Title V database. Certification of compliance was therefore completed by the facility with a high degree of confidence.

NAME="challenges"></A>ONGOING WORK AND CHALLENGES<HR></H2>The A*I*M*S-Title V database is a dynamic entity which is continuing to evolve through continued development by ERM, as well as within the two Rohm and Haas facilities. Ongoing work at ERM on the database is focused on the enhancement of its capabilities and customization for facilities located in several other states, and addressing the Title V programs of the Jefferson County Air Pollution Control District in Kentucky, the State of Oklahoma, and the State of New York. There are a number of challenges being addressed currently in ongoing work: </BLOCKQUOTE>Enhancing the Applicable Requirements module to create as close an electronic equivalent as possible to a human air permitting thought-process; Establishing an automated link between the database's Emission Calculations module and calculations performed in spreadsheets external to the database; Creating a fully-featured Permit Manager module that allows expanded access to compliance schedules, action items and other permit management-related functions during the life of the Title V permit; and Integrating the database with other electronic environmental and air quality management tools, such as dispersion modeling programs, GIS-based visualization tools, and environmental compliance software such as ERM's Lotus Notes-based Environmental Quality Manager (EQM). </H4><H4><CENTER><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC=

NAME="conclusion"></A>CONCLUSIONS<HR></H2>A truly functional facility-based, electronic Title V permit development and management tool must meet a number of requirements, including a flexible and adaptable structure, air permitting-based intuitiveness of use, and the ability to be easily customized and modified at the facility level. The A*I*M*S-Title V database has been developed to address these requirements, and its implementation at two Rohm and Haas facilities is described in this paper. As the experiences described in this paper demonstrate, the database has provided significant benefits to the facilities during the course of permit development, with respect to both time and expense as well as in decreasing the tediousness of the associated tasks. The dynamic nature of the Title V permit also enhances the value of the database as a permit management tool through the life of the permit. Considering the net benefits, the implementation of the database has been well-worth both facilities' investments in time and resources. </BLOCKQUOTE><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b><HR></H2>The authors wish to acknowledge the contributions of Mr. C.

In Australia, ERM Mitchell McCotter has a very strong position in the market and posted a 28 percent increase in revenues for the 1996 fiscal year over the prior year.  It opened an office in Melbourne, bringing the total to six locations across the continent.  ERM's Australian staff of approximately 100 handles not only traditional environmental consulting and engineering, but also archeological surveys, community relations, traffic and transport studies, town planning, rail studies, acoustics, even investigations of flora and fauna.  The client base is similarly broad.  In addition to local and multinational industry,  ERM Mitchell McCotter performs assignments for Australia's coal, steel, mining and forestry industries as well as for national, state and local governments.<P>
During the 1996 fiscal year, concerns for the safety of tens of thousands of people led to ERM being asked to study a plan to minimize flooding associated with the Warragamba Dam, which supplies Sydney's water.  ERM's groundbreaking environmental impact statement used innovative public consultation strategies and new kinds of analyses which related intangible ecological impacts to tangible economic benefits offered by flood mitigation.<P>
Another assignment initiated during the year examined the effects of an expansion of one of the largest coal loading terminals in the world, located north of Sydney in the city of Newcastle.  The study evaluated many factors: contaminated land, harbor dredging, acoustics, air quality, traffic patterns and community relations. For Australia's Federal Airports Corporation, ERM was asked to estimate future noise levels and recommend flight planning guidelines at the Brisbane International Airport, which is surrounded by heavily populated residential neighborhoods.<P>

<B><KBD> EMAS Certification</KBD></B><P>
The exact nature of assignments varies from country to country.  In Germany, corporate clients are eager to institute environmental management systems.  Of the 200 companies that had applied for EMAS certification by early 1996, about 180 were from Germany.  To meet this demand, ERM created "Dynamic Certification",  a service which offers companies the support required to obtain EMAS certification in only six months, compared to the average time in Germany of nine months.<P>
In Italy, health and safety concerns have been highlighted by a new law that requires companies to have long
term plans in place to protect workers.  ERM's Italian offices are working with industrial clients on these plans, as well as on typical due diligence and compliance audits.  The company has a number of substantial contracts for soil and groundwater remediation, and three site assessments for the U.S. Navy.  During fiscal year 1996, ERM Italy, which has offices in Rome and Milan, also was asked to verify the environmental annual reports of Montedison &#139; the largest private Italian chemical company &#139; and AGIP Petroli.<P>
ERM has grown steadily in France since the Paris office was established in early 1994.  It now supplies a full range of auditing, planning, permitting and waste management services.  Through the ERM network and its own local contacts, the Paris office has attracted as clients some of the world's most prestigious corporations &#139; Procter and Gamble, Kimberly-Clark,  Schlumberger and Conoco, among others. <P>
In the U.K., ERM was cited as the top multi-service environmental consultancy in an independent market survey carried out by Environmental Data Services Ltd., a respected independent publishing company.  ERM's U.K. offices handle a full range of environmental assessments and planning, environmental health and safety (EHS) property transfer audits, site investigations and remediation, and pollution control work.  They now also have assignments developing health and safety management systems, training packages and installation of environmental software for clients in the U.K. and overseas, often working with other ERM offices.  The U.K. practice is very active with the developers of environmental policy, bringing the needs of industry and commerce firmly into the picture so that pragmatic and workable solutions can be found to environmental problems.<P><BR>
<B><KBD> Technical Studies</KBD></B><P>
The growing emphasis on economic factors in the environmental arena generated many contracts during the 1996 fiscal year for studies involving life cycle analysis, cost-benefit evaluations, project appraisals, and assessments of value anticipated from environmental investments.  The U.K. Department of Trade and Industry, for instance, commissioned a study that evaluated the potential effects of proposed legislation concerning volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on various industries.  For a lighting manufacturer, ERM performed detailed technical work and life cycle analyses to define which products qualified for special labeling under the European Union's eco-labeling directive.  At the end of the fiscal year, a new practice dedicated to Life Cycle Analysis was formed in the U.K.<P>
In recent years, severe droughts have created a water shortage of crisis proportions for much of the industry in the U.K.  ERM was hired during the year by several companies to find ways of recycling, reducing water use, and improving treatment of wastewater in order to gain relief from escalating water prices and plummeting supply.  In the north of England, ERM's EnviroClean group tackled the remediation of a former landfill at Sun Lane, introducing a reed bed filtration system to treat the leachate prior to discharge to the adjacent watercourse.  Recent legislation governing contaminated land is expected to boost remedial work throughout the U.K.<P><BR>
<B><KBD> EMS Breakthrough </KBD></B><P>
Fiscal year 1996 was a breakthrough year for environmental management systems (EMS).  With EMAS taking effect during 1995 and ISO 14000 in 1996, clients began devoting serious resources to implementing EMS throughout their organizations.  During the year, ERM carried out a detailed analysis of existing management systems compared to the requirements of EMAS at four facilities owned by a global petrochemical company in Europe. The resulting action plan enabled the company's plant in the Netherlands to become one of the first sites in Europe to be registered under EMAS.

<B><KBD> Changing Market</KBD></B><P>
The environmental engineering and consulting field in the U.S. has changed substantially over the last five years, with the explosive growth rates of the 1980s slowing to less than three percent a year.  The market drivers are shifting from regulations to economic considerations.  This means that ERM's success in the U.S. will depend on its ability to deliver targeted services that improve a company's bottom line.<P>
Traditional services such as site remediation and air and water quality remain strong.  ERM also is very active in a number of emerging specialties, including risk-based corrective action, brownfields, and development of environmental management systems.  Other new products and services, such as patented technology, RCRA Part B Permit renewals, EHS training and litigation support also are making significant contributions.  For instance, ERM opened a 15,000-square foot safety training center in Alsip, Illinois, which offers hands-on training in emergency response, confined space entry and technical rescue training under controlled, simulated conditions &#139; a highly effective alternative to classroom sessions.<P>
During the 1996 fiscal year, the remediation market moved further away from studies to actual cleanups, generating substantial revenues.  In Houston, Texas, for instance, quick response was needed when old oil was discovered bubbling up under a school just before the school was scheduled to reopen for the fall semester.  ERM was brought in to investigate and recommend a remedial plan under the Texas Risk Reduction Rules, which attempts to link cleanup standards to a site's future use.  In the Rocky Mountain region, ERM serves many clients in the transportation sector, helping them achieve cost-effective remediation at major airports, including Denver's Stapleton International Airport.<P>
Several brownfields projects took shape during the year.  ERM's Boston office is working with  others to transform an abandoned petroleum refinery into a liquefied natural gas distribution facility employing hundreds of workers in Trinidad, West Indies. In California, ERM is working with Southern Pacific Railroad on a long-term project to turn 240 acres of contaminated land into a mixed use extension of downtown Sacramento.  ERM's  Houston office helped the city of Houston win a grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to assess how to handle the city's large number of brownfields sites.<P>
ERM also is completing major remediation of a Superfund site in Denver.  While this effort started before the formal announcement of the brownfields program by USEPA, site activities are following the approach of the brownfields initiative and site agreements include the only known covenant "not to sue" at any brownfields project in the U.S.<P>
A major beneficiary of brownfields initiatives and of the trend toward risk-based cleanups is ERM Enviro
Clean, which has ten offices throughout the U.S. and posted a 13 percent increase in revenues in FY96. It specializes in environmental construction and in operations and maintenance projects such as industrial wastewater treatment plants. <P>
EnviroClean designed and installed a unique vacuum sewer system; completed a $2 million landfill cap repair in four months under a design/build contract with a major waste disposal company; and constructed a groundwater treatment system with a 4,800-foot deep well at a Superfund site in Gary, Indiana.<P>
ERM Program Management Company (PMC), which represents one of the largest segments of ERM revenues in the U.S., solves hazardous or radioactive waste problems for federal agencies.  Established in 1990, PMC earned a place as number 260 on <I>Inc.</I> magazine's list of America's 500 fastest-growing companies last year.  Also, PMC won a five-year, $20 million contract from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to provide remedial investigation, permitting and installation for the Army's environmental restoration program in seven states. <P>

PMC focuses exclusively on federal agencies, but they are served by other offices, too. ERM's Walnut Creek, California, office, for example, won a five-year, $50 million contract last
year from the Department of Defense to provide technical services to the National Guard in nine states.  ERM's Woodbury, New York, office provided more than $1.5 million worth of site remediation services to the Department of Energy's Brook-haven National Laboratory.<P>
Local government agencies can 
be members of the regulated community as well.  Hillsborough County and the city of Tampa, Florida, for instance, may realize a significant savings in closure costs on a municipal landfill Superfund site because ERM's Tampa office successfully proved to USEPA that the landfill was
not responsible for contamination nearby.  And ERM also won a 
$30 million, three-year contract in FY96 to help clean up sites owned by the Metro Dade Transit Authority in Florida.<P>
<BR>
<B><KBD>Air Services Expand</KBD></B><P>
Air quality services remained a strong business for ERM, adding risk analysis and process safety management to established services such as new source reviews and permitting.  ERM obtained Title V permits for many corporations and for major universities.  At a large chemical manufacturing plant, ERM sampled and analyzed more than 90 waste streams to determine whether existing control systems met new regulations governing air emissions from wastewater. <P>
ERM sharpened its technological 
edge considerably during the year. 
A patent was granted for the Advanced Fluidized Composting (AFCSM) system, and the first two
full-scale installations were launched in Trenton, New Jersey, and Wawa, Pennsylvania.  The AFC process transforms high-strength wastewater or organic sludge into carbon dioxide and water, reducing the volume of sludge by 95 percent and making AFC a cost-effective alternative to other types of treatment such as incineration.<P>
<BR>
<B><KBD> Meeting Goals </KBD></B><P>
ERM is working with an increasing number of clients to establish corporate environmental management systems, which can help meet the goals of environmental stewardship and regulatory compliance more cost
effectively than traditional programs.  One tool available through ERM is Environmental Quality Manager (EQM), an action-oriented software package that organizes every regulatory requirement into a series of tasks that can then be scheduled and monitored. <P>
Companies in the U.S. are always looking for ways to improve environmental performance.  The Gillette Company, for instance, worked with ERM's Boston office to win a grant from USEPA's Environmental Leadership Program during the past year.  The experiment will allow Gillette to create an auditing program that relies on independent, third-party certification and could eventually point the way toward greater self-regulation for industry.

<h1>Help for simple search</h1>
<BODY>
The simple text search allows you to search for information using search words, modifiers, and operators. When you enter a word as a query, a simple text parser will add some simple modifiers to the word and pass everything to the search engine. You can also use traditional search operators such as AND, OR, and NOT. Results are measured by documents scores; the higher the score, the more likely the document will match the specified search criteria.
<BR>
<BR>
You can specify the following criteria in the simple search screen:
<ul>
<li><B>Subject</B>: Select one collection from the drop-down list to include in your search. A collection represents a list of documents currently available for you to search. 
<p>
<li><B>Search for</B>:  Type a word or phrase in this field to represent the text you want to search for in the collection you previously selected. Follow these rules for specifying your search text:
<p>
To search for multiple words, separate each word with a space.  For example, if you specify <i>time manage</i>, simple search will return all documents that contain the words <i>time</i> or <i>manage</i>. Additionally, it will return all documents that contain variations of these words, such as <i>timely</i> and <i>management</i>.
</ul>
</ul>
<B>
Example</B><BR>
<BR>
To search for the words Monterey and otter in collection X, follow these steps: 
<ol>
<li>Select collection X from the <b>Subject drop-down</b> list.
<li>Enter the following in the <b>Search for</b> field:
<pre>Monterey otter</pre>
<li>Click <b>Search</b>. If any documents contain the words Monterey or otter (or variations of these words), a list with all the documents will appear.

<BODY>
Use advanced search to search multiple collections and produce more accurate search results by using additional criteria to a search word or phrase.
<BR>
<BR>
You can specify the following criteria in the advanced search screen:
<ul>
<li><B>Subject</B>: Click one or more collections in the list box to include in your search. A collection represents a list of documents currently available for you to search.
<p>
<li><B>Search for</B>: Type a word or phrase in this field to represent the text you want to search for in the collections you previously selected. Follow these rules for specifying your search text:
<ul>
<p>
<li>To search for multiple words, separate each word with a space. For example, if you specify <i>time manage</i>, the search engine will return all documents that contain the words <i>time</i> or <i>manage</i>. Additionally, it will return all documents that contain variations of these words, such as <i>timely</i> and <i>management</i>.
<p>
<li>If you are going to perform a Boolean search, you can search for an exact word or phrase by enclosing the word or phrase in quotation marks. For example, if you specify &quot;time manage&quot; as your Boolean search query, a list of all documents that contain the phrase &quot;time manage&quot; will appear.  
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Search syntax</b>: There are two types of search syntax you can use: literal (free text) and Boolean search. A literal text search finds the documents most similar to your query. A Boolean search allows you to use traditional search operators such as AND, OR, and NOT for exact match searching.  
<p>
<ul>
<li>Use <B>AND</B> to return all documents that contain the words you specified in the <B>Search for</B> field. For example, entering <b>Monet AND lilies</b> would return all documents that contained the words Monet and lilies. 
<p>
<li>Use <b>OR</b> to return all documents that contain at least one of the words you specified in the <b>Search for</b> field. For example, entering <b>Monet OR lilies</b> would return documents that contained Monet or lilies.
<BR>
<li>Use <b>NOT</b> to return all documents that contain the first word you entered in the <b>Search for</b> field, but not the second word you entered. For example, entering <b>Monet NOT lilies</b> would return documents that only contained Monet but no lilies.
</ul>
<p><li><B>Number of files to return</B>: Indicates the maximum number of documents you want the system to return after the search. Documents are rated according to relevance; the more occurrences of the search criteria you specified, the more relevant a document is and the more likely it is to be the one you want. To restrict your search to only those documents with the highest relevance ratings, type the number of documents you want to see in this field. 
<B>
</ul>
Example</B><BR>
<BR>
Search for the phrase <i>time management</i> in collections X, Y, and Z using a Boolean search. Include documents that also contain the word &quot;schedule&quot; and any of its variations. Exclude any documents that pertaining to the subject of &quot;office&quot;. Only show 20 returned documents.  
<ol>
<li>Select the X, Y, and Z collections from the <b>Subject</b> list box.
<li>Enter the following in the <b>Search for</b> field:

<B>Now is the time to computerize air compliance management. Or suffer. 
 </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</FONT>
By Donna Engelgau
<p>

<FONT SIZE=20>I</FONT>magine a reporting program for 
air emission sources and their regulatory requirements so extensive and complex that industry officials have said there won't be enough qualified personnel in the country to implement the program once all the various reports are received.
<p>
You don't have to imagine it. You've got it. It's called Title V.
<p>
Now imagine an electronic system that keeps track of a facility's air emissions sources, automatically tabulates and compiles the information required to prepare a Title V application, and then remits a report for the regulating body to review-as close to signed, sealed and delivered as one could hope for.
<p>
Fortunately, you don't have to imagine that, either.
<p>
That was not the case just a short time ago, given that the federal Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 made facility compliance with air pollution regulations more challenging and information-intensive than ever before. 
<p>
After all, Title V permits not only cover every emission source at a plant, they also set minimum compliance standards, periodic compliance certification and record-keeping and reporting requirements. This is the first time that many sites fall under the rubric of the CAAA, not to mention that many facilities that previously were grandfathered out of state and local permit requirements are now required to obtain the new CAAA permits.
<p>
The mere thought of undertaking this task, which will require the collection and maintenance of reams of emissions and compliance data, has caused many industry groups, as well as state and local agencies, to call Title V a "paperwork nightmare"-one that's tremendously time-consuming and likely to put a dent in the bottom line. Such a nightmare, 
in fact, that industry officials have often said that there aren't enough qualified professionals to handle it.
<p>
When one considers that the law regulates approximately 50,000 industrial facilities, the consequences of sheer volume seem daunting indeed. "Air used to be something you got a permit for and it was good for life," says R. Mukund, Ph.D., project manager in the air consulting practice at Environmental Resources Management (ERM) in Albany, NY. "But now that's over. Air is probably one of the most complex media in terms of regulation, especially with Title V."
<p>
While many companies have tackled the job by putting more pencils to paper, others are beginning to rely upon another workhorse altogether: software systems that track air emissions sources and their compliance requirements, tabulate the data and place them in the correct forms for federal, state and local review.
<p>
"The implementation of a database for Title V and for future air compliance has made the task of filling out the voluminous application forms fairly easy, allowing more time to devote to compliance issues and the actual permit content," reports Suzanne Verzilli, assistant environmental manager with Rohm & Haas in Bristol, PA, in a paper to be presented at the annual meeting of the Air & Waste Management Association in Nashville, TN, this month. The paper, co-written by Jennifer McIntyre, an environmental engineer with Rohm & Haas in Philadelphia, and ERM's Mukund, is titled "Implementing a Facility-Customized Air 
Information Management System for Title V Permit Development and Management (A*I*M*S-Title V): Practical Experiences."
<p>
Environmental managers increasingly will come to rely upon database systems, never to return to their old methods, predicts Verzilli. "It's a definite trend for environmental systems," she says, as companies begin to focus on compliance rather than on the mechanics of the permit. 
<p>
Of course, there's no one-size-fits-all database management system. However, from Verzilli's point of view, now is the time to computerize for air compliance management. "Even though Title V may not be the impetus for getting into the computer age, it's certainly a good starting point," she says. "Unless you use an electronic database, Title V is going to be harder to handle than in the past."
<p>
While it's premature to say how much the database will save the company-it's been in use only nine months-Verzilli says it has eliminated "the middle piece of work, where 
you're manually transferring data 
from one place to another."
<p>
McIntyre says the customized A*I*M*S-Title V database the Philadelphia and Bristol plants now use, which was developed by ERM in Albany, is "an invaluable tool for someone who's in charge of compliance. It develops reports fairly easily."
<p>
That's critical for Rohm & Haas's Philadelphia and Bristol facilities, which manufacture specialty chemicals for industry, water treatment and agricultural use. Both facilities submitted their Title V applications using the database last November.
<p>
"We have 100 or so applicable requirements, and each has to have a method of compliance tied to it," says McIntyre, who has further tailored the database to suit her facility's needs. "The problem we've had in the past is keeping track of 
all that."
<p>
Because of the success so far, McIntyre intends to expand the use of the database this year to include annual emissions reporting-a chore that previously would have required facility managers to tabulate their own data-and for permit maintenance and auditing, since the software can generate customized audit forms.
<p>
The number of off-the-shelf environmental software products has been growing at a rapid rate since the early 1990s. Today there are approximately 2,200 such programs on the market, of which perhaps as many as 500 are for air quality-relatedapplications, according to Scott M. Johnson, planning manager for the Ventura County (CA) Air Pollution Control District and the author of the 1996 Guide to Environmental Software Products, published by
the Air & Waste Management Association. Three years ago, Johnson's survey turned up only 600 environmental software programs.
<p> 
In the rapidly changing world of environmental information technology, choosing software can be frustrating and difficult. But some trends seem clear-such as the importance of sound databases. "It's tough to pin down what solution would be ideal for every company," says Johnson. "But integrated solutions are key, so you can use one core database for everything."
<p>
Tinker Air Force Base, which is one of the world's largest electroplating facilities and has more than 1,000 emissions units, has been assembling its Title V database for 18 months in preparation for the Part 70 permit application it must submit in two years. "Even though Tinker has permits on lots of things, they're starting now from ground zero," says ERM's Mukund, who is assisting the base with a customized version of A*I*M*S-Title V. "That way they can replace a motley collection of permits and information with an integrated, streamlined database." Before employing its new, more comprehensive software, Tinker had a program that monitored only health and safety emissions from the more than 10,000 chemicals and 500 different industrial processes it uses.
<p>
"The Title V permit is massive," says Geri Hart, supervisory environmental engineer with the Oklahoma City facility, which, among other things, paints and strips KC-135 and 
B-52 aircraft. "We're looking at going from 150 to 1,200 (regulated) sources. You can imagine the kinds of information that will have to be developed for those 1,200 sources. It's too much data to manage manually."
<p>
Complying with Title V is a huge undertaking for just about everyone affected, but as Rohm & Haas and Tinker Air Force Base have learned, the latest generation of electronic solutions can make the headaches just a little easier to bear.

<strong> What is The Women's Pharmacy?</strong></center><BR>
The Women's Pharmacy is a mail order pharmacy service fulfilling women's prescription
and over-the-counter product needs.  By working in partnership with RxAmerica, a
licensed mail order pharmacy, we can provide women of all ages a new way to purchase
pharmaceutical products -- and we can save you both money and time!<P><HR><BR>


<strong> <center> Why was The Women's Pharmacy created?</strong> </center><BR>
How many times have you made that dreaded trip to the drug store to purchase some
personal product like tampons, birth control, a pregnancy test -- only to run into a
friend, a co-worker or, worse, a drug store clerk who screams for a PRICE CHECK for the
condoms you're buying?  <P>
It has always seemed rather strange to us that the items that are the most personal are
sold in the most public of places.  This is why we created The Women's <br>Pharmacy --
to provide the much needed privacy and convenience in shopping for personal
products.<P><HR><BR>

<strong><center>What Can I Purchase from <br>The Women's
Pharmacy?</strong></center><BR>
Our product list includes both branded and generic prescription and over-the-counter
women's products.  Because we work with RxAmerica, a full-service, licensed mail order
pharmacy, we can fulfill virtually pharmaceutical need for women and their families. 
Take a look at our over-the-counter <a href="prodlst.html"><B>Product
List.</B></a><P>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Careers in CyberSpace are certainly no longer the stronghold of men.  Lots of women have entered -- and conquered -- this ever changing Cyber world.  Courtney Macavinta's feature story, kicking off WomenSpace's <B>Women on the Internet</B> series, highlights Camp's unique perspective on working in CyberSpace.
<center><IMG SRC="../images/ruleyl.gif" BORDER=0></center><BR>

<BR>
<P><B>by Courtney Macavinta</P></B>

<P><img align=left src="../images/scamp2.gif">Susanna Camp has opinions.  She broadcasts them because opinions are like a pulse, they prove one is alive.  Everyday Camp checks the world's vital signs via the Internet.  She listens to online conversations, puts in her two cents. She creates dialogue.  Breeding                                                                                                                                                    opinions is Camp's job.</P></FONT>
         <P>Camp is the senior producer of Piazza, the interactive soul of Hotwired, Wired magazine's online cousin. Once tucked in the back corner of Wired's San Francisco offices, Hotwired has evolved from a digital amoeba to the Bionic Woman in just over 18 months.</P>
<P>One of the most critically-claimed, sponsor-supported ezines, Hotwired was the first website to be A.C. Nielsen rated. It houses content-intensive channels such as Renaissance,  containing arts and entertainment reviews, previews and features; and, most recently Netizen, for online coverage of the 1996 election.
         <P>Having been at Hotwired for more than a year, Camp is a veteran netchick.  Hired as an editorial assistant, she now oversees Piazza, which contains Club Wired, a venue where live guests interact with Hotwired members; Rants & Raves, for consumer feedback; and Threads, a combination of bulletin board discussions and commentary.</P>
         <BLOCKQUOTE><P>Posting ideas in Threads is one of Camp's favorite diversions, but her work in Club Wired may trigger the most envy.  She coordinates guests and works with engineers to produce most of the online sessions, including real audio music performances.  Club Wired features political outlaws, authors, cybertheorists, musicians, film makers and various prophets are also featured in Club Wired. Icons of digital culture top the guest list, but there's always a variety. Cypress Hill, Laurie Anderson, Timothy Leary, Jaron Lanier, Malcolm McLaren, Douglas Coupland, Bruce Sterling and Joey Ramone have all stopped by the Club.</P>
<P>Camp, along with an assistant producer, coordinates, promotes, and moderates Piazza events. During a Club Wired session, the guest is introduced by a moderator, and interviewed by the audience. Later, the transcripts are archived.</P>
<P>Recently, real-audio sessions, such as band performances, were launched. Currently, you can enter the Club through a telnet window (the software is available from Hotwired's shareware toolkit .) According to Camp, an entirely web-based system will be implemented in about a month.</P>
         <P>Books and autographed pictures from Club Wired guests surround Camp's tiny domain, about 6 feet of Hotwired's floor space. As she sits propped up on her right foot, dangling her other leg below her, wearing jeans and sneakers 28-year-old Camp looks like a high school student. This is true of most of the company's twenty-something employees. Youth emits a sense of wisdom here. These people seem to be in the know. Camp is one of them.</P>
         <P>"They wanted someone who was smart and who knew about the Net," she says of people who interviewed her for the job.  "They wanted somebody who 'got it'- who understands that interactivity is it."</P>
        <P> She fits the criteria, but she didn't always.  After graduating in 1989 with a degree in English from a small liberal arts college in Massachusetts, Camp admits that she had little direction.  She bartended for a while, and took an eight-week publishing course at Harvard. What cost her a big chunk of change was really a Ivy League network-fest.</P>
	<P>"I had some offers in New York, but instead I came out here on a long shot," Camp says.</P>
<img align=left src="../images/camppull.gif" BORDER=0>         
<P>In San Francisco, she landed her first gig in publishing - a position in MacWorld magazine's circulation department.  Before long, she was a manager. However, spewing direct mail around the globe was not her idea of publishing. Without a job waiting in the wings, Camp left MacWorld.</P>
        <P>"I was getting promotions and rewards, but I had to ask myself 'Can I justify this?' You wake up and realize it's your life. I didn't want a career full of compromises, so I left."</P>       
<P>During her stint at a small Internet directory company,  running mail servers and configuring modems, Camp saw beyond her computer's opaque screen.  By picking engineers' brains, solving technical problems herself through trial and error, and subscribing to industry news letters, Camp broke out of her consumer role.  Turned on by her new relationship with technology, she sought a job that utilized all of her skills. She landed at Hotwired.</P>
        <P> "Now my job is something that I'm engaged in.  You have to go beyond getting involved. The whole medium is right there with you. You can think about the software, coding.. it's all transparent. All the tools are at your disposal," she says.</P>
         <P>Her favorite book to date, "Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet," by Sherry Turkle may explain for others what she's been "getting" all along, she says. </P>
        <P>"'Life on the Screen helps you get a lot more about your relationship to computers," she says. "The interactive element (of the Internet) is how you learn."</P>
        <P> Camp breaks things down so they're simple. Her homepage is an example, "Things that make me think."  The indices are simple: words, bourbon, reading and music. Each section only contains a quote or short essay.</P>
         <P>On her site, she posted a definition of  the word "dialect."  The word seems to encompass why she  interacts on and off-line, why she thinks everyone should. She defines dialect as, "The art or practice of arriving at the truth by the exchange of logical arguments.... The contradiction between two conflicting forces viewed as the determining factor in their continuing interaction."</P>
         <P>Susanna Camp would be harvesting and offering opinions even if the Internet didn't exist.  She'd determine whether or not people were alive by what they had to say. "Conferencing is a good way to prove to yourself and everybody else that you're here and you count. It's really  important just to have an opinion."</P>
        <P>And so she does.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>Advice from Anthony</H1></center>
Kicking off WomenSpace's new fitness column, some general thoughts on working out and having fun.

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><img align=left src="../images/advice.gif">Why do we exercise?</b>  You can exercise to be stronger, have more endurance, train for a sport, lose weight, boost your self-esteem, or just to be healthy.  Because people exercise for different reasons, they are motivated to exercise in different ways; you can weight train at a health club, run in the park, rollerblade, or play an organized sport. But whatever you do, have fun doing it.  Exercise shouldn't be a chore; it should be part of your lifestyle. With that in mind, there are some things to think about when planning how and when you'll exercise.</p>

<p>Regular exercise reduces the risk of injury, heart disease, and osteoporosis (a disease that makes your bones thin and brittle as you get older.) It can help lift you mood and make you feel more energetic when you're not working out.</p>

<p>If you want to join a health club or gym but feel intimidated; take heart. Get a friend to join with you and become training partners.  Encourage each other to go to the gym and to work harder when you're there. Not only will a friend provide moral support, but will make your workout less boring.  And <B>never feel afraid to ask a trainer for advice</B>, whether it's to learn to use a new machine, or to find out if you're doing an exercise correctly-- that's what they're there for! It's a million times better to ask for help that to hurt yourself performing an exercise incorrectly.</p>

<p>It's very important to avoid exercising ONLY on weekends.  You can injure yourself by going all out and exercising only once or twice a week. Your body needs a day or two between intense workouts to rest and repair. Always space out your workout routine throughout the week-- that way you'll get all the benefits of exercising, and your body will thank you for it.</p><BR><BR>

<H1>Top Ten Reasons to Exercise</H1>
... that have nothing to do with "losing weight!"</center>

<BR></FONT>
<center><IMG SRC="../images/ruleyl.gif" BORDER=0></center><BR>
<P>

<b>by Dr. Joseph Bosco</b>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to exercise that have nothing to do with the typical reasons you hear  -- like "to lose weight" or "to look better."   Of course, these are great side effects from exercising -- but you may enjoy working out a little more if you felt less pressure "to lose weight."  Read my Top Ten reasons to exercise below and pat yourself on the back for doing all these other great things the next time you exercise!</p>

<p>
#1 - Exercise helps strengthen your heart muscle -- and a strong heart means it will last longer -- and so will you!</p>

<p>
#2 - Endorphins are released in your brain when you exercise which gives you a feeling of "euphoria" -- an all around great sensation that underscores the saying that "it's pretty hard to feel depressed when your exercising!"</p>

<p>
#3 - Exercise relieves mental and physical stress and tension.  Forty-five minutes of working out will relieve an entire day's worth of stress.
</p>

<p>
#4 - Your aerobic stamina increases when you exercise -- so that everyday activities like climbing stairs, shoveling snow and walking uphill become easier.
</p>

<p>
#5 - You can sink into a deeper sleep when you exercise regularly because you relieve excess tension that could otherwise make for fitful nights.
</p>

<p>
#6 - Exercise raises your base line metabolism so that you can actually eat more without worrying about putting on extra pounds.
</p>

<p>
#7 - Your peripheral muscles (in your arms and legs) strengthen with exercise so that you can easily do activities like carry groceries or kids without strain.
</p>

<p>
#8 - Exercise will help lower the levels of bad cholesterol in your body and actually increase the levels of good cholesterol -- making your chances of avoiding heart disease even better.
</p>

<p>
#9 - Your heart will beat more efficiently with regular exercise which will help you in combating high blood pressure later in life.
</p>

<p>
#10 - Exercise involving moderate and even low impact helps your bones retain calcium reserves -- which aids in preventing osteoporosis.
</p>

<P>As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to exercise that have nothing to do with  "losing weight."  Consider exercise to be a means of feeling better, preventing disease, living longer -- and, of course, having fun!</P>

<H1>Depression - How to Fight it and Win</H1></center><BR>

<P><b>by Cheryl Alkon</b></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Everyone feels a little down sometimes.  Who wouldn't? Life is filled with challenges and complications.  Anything from getting a bad grade to breaking up with a boyfriend can make you feel sad.  Even bad weather can affect people's moods.  But what about when you, or a friend, always feels like nothing is worth the effort, even though everything seems to be going okay?</P>

<P>When this feeling lasts for awhile and gets in the way of your life, or comes in repeated cycles, you could be suffering from clinical depression.  Someone who is clinically depressed cannot just 'snap out of it,' and often, they can't explain just why they feel depressed.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>What are the signs of depression?</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Signs of depression include feeling hopeless or helpless about life.  These feelings can translate into feeling less interested in your hobbies, sports, clubs or other activities that you used to be involved in.</P>
<P>Someone who is depressed may be sleeping or eating a lot more, or less, than she used to before she felt depressed. Other indications of depression include a big drop in grades, hanging out with a different group of friend or dropping friends altogether.
It's important to distinguish clinical depression from other emotions such as grief.  If you have experienced a loss, such as the death of someone close, or you've just broken up with your boyfriend, it's normal to feel down for a period of time. A period of grief may last from several weeks to even a year.  It's important to realize the difference--  grief is feeling sad about your loss, a natural reaction. But sometimes people don't work through their loss and it can turn into depression.</P>

<P>Sometimes someone may feel so depressed that they plan to end everything and kill themselves.  According to Melisa Poulos, Assistant Director of the Samaritans and the Coordinator of the Samaritan program, a nationwide support group for  teenagers, teenage girls are more likely than boys to attempt suicide, although boys are more likely to die from their suicide attempts.  Girls may be more likely to seek help for their problems, or talk and write about their feelings to try to help themselves feel better.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>How can I get help?</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is important to get help right away if you feel depressed or suicidal, or if you think a friend is depressed and/or considering suicide.  To get help, talk to someone you can trust, such as a parent, a teacher, a counselor at school or a friend who will listen to you, take you seriously and get you help.  If you think a friend has a problem, talk to them openly.  Encourage your friend to seek help.  "Ideally, an adult who is familiar with this sort of situation is the best person" to seek help from, says Melisa Poulos. </P>
<P>If you don't feel you can talk with anyone you know about feeling depressed or suicidal, there are many agencies and organizations you can turn to.  These places can provide a listener who will let you talk about your problems without judging you and will give referrals and options on where you can get help.  A few numbers are listed below; all are 24-hour crisis hot lines.</P>

<P>You can also check your local telephone book (usually the yellow pages) under Social and Human Services, Suicide Prevention Services, Counseling, and Youth Services.
It is very important that you keep calling until you can get help.  Sometimes you can't pull yourself out of your depression on your own. "To treat clinical depression, medication, psychotherapy, and support all go hand-in-hand," says Evie Barkin, Vice President of the Manic Depressive and Depressive Association of Boston.</P>

<P>You won't be turned away if money is a problem, either.  "There are lots of services available that do not charge or will negotiate their fees," says Genny Price, Clinical Director of Bridge Over Troubled Waters in Boston.  "A professional can't say, 'no money, no service.' There's an ethical obligation to help."</P>

<P>If you get a busy signal or if no one answers the phone when you call,  DO NOT GIVE UP.  Call another organization right away.</P>
<P>Feeling depressed or suicidal are feelings that can changed.  Help is available.  Don't give up hope in your life or yourself.</P>

<P><B>For help combatting depression, you can call any of these 24-hour hotlines:</B></P>

<P>Listen up, girls!  I've got some things <BR>to tell you about this whole "growing up" thing. <BR> Your health teacher, your mom, your <BR>older sister might call it "puberty" -- <BR>but I call it <BR>BodyShock!!<BR><BR>'Cause with all the crazy, random things that happen <BR>to your body  --  a perfectly calm, cool girl <BR>could go totally nuts trying to figure it all out!</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="../../winter/images/juggle.gif" BORDER=0>You know what I mean ... <BR>you're cruising through life with everything<BR> under control -- and then, all of a sudden, <BR> somebody throws in stuff like <BR>acne, shaving, bras ... and this <BR>whole "period" business!<BR><BR>But trying to juggle them <BR>with all your other stuff can be <BR>a bit too much!<BR><BR></P>
<P>I remember the day somebody finally <BR>clued me in on what it meant to "start my period!"  
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="../../winter/images/what.gif" BORDER=0>
<P>I was totally like ...<BR><BR>"I'm going to do WHAT?  <BR>From WHERE? <BR>For HOW long?!!"<BR></P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="../../winter/images/facts.gif" BORDER=0>telling me all kinds of crazy myths<BR> about starting my period ... <BR>all of which turned out to be totally false! </P>
<P>I had had enough!  So I set out on a mission to find out the facts myself!  And I'm happy to report that I've compiled them into my handy-dandy booklet called <b>Ten Rules To Survive BodyShock!</b> </P>

<p>by Kym May</p></B>
<p>	<blockquote>
 First off, if you look good, you'll feel good. And while you should always love your body and accept the way you look, when you feel that you look good physically and you feel strong then you'll feel confident and happier. There are also physiological benefits from exercise (see below for a link to our Top Ten) .</p>
<p>There are different kinds of exercise-- including aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic exercises involve the large muscle groups (your legs and arms) and increases your heart rate.  It's good for your heart, burns calories, and you'll lose excess fat. Anaerobic activities, in which you work hard in short spurts (such as weight training) build and strengthen your muscles. It's what gives you a firm, toned look and makes you stronger.</p>
<p>To get all the good benefits, you should try to exercise regularly, several times a week. When you do-- do something FUN!!!  You don't need to go to an expensive gym or hire a personal trainer to get in shape-- just grab a frisbee and a friend and head over to the nearest park.  Here are some suggestions of ways to exercise that are so much fun you'll forget that old adage, "no pain, no gain":</p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI><B>Ice skating/ rollerblading--</B> Two of my all-time faves, I think that there's nothing like the feel of wind in your hair as you glide along.  And, it's a great way to meet cute, athletic boys!<BR>
<LI><B>Ultimate Frisbee--</B> If you can get a group of people together, this sport will keep you moving.  It's sort of a cross between soccer and football, but with a frisbee. And there's no referees- fouls and goals get called by a sort of honor system called 'Spirit of the Game.' Do a yahoo search for Ultimate Frisbee web sites for the rules and for information on local frisbee teams that you can join, or call the Ultimate Players' Association at 1-800-UPA-GETH (that stands for Get Horizontal- as when catching a low-to-the-ground frisbee). <BR>
<LI><B>Dancing--</B> Dance the night away at a club or party, and you'll burn off lots of spare calories! Or take a dancing class-- you can go wild with some exotic styles, like salsa, meringue, or even belly dancing!<BR>
<LI><B>Walking--</B> Do it fast, do it long, and it's one of the best (and cheapest) ways to get in shape.  It's even better for you than running or jogging, because it's non-jarring and non-impact, and better for your bones and joints.<BR>
<LI><B>Biking--</B> If you don't have a bike, check the yellow pages for rental shops in your area. Then hop on and take it for a spin around the neighborhood!  Tone those legs! (Just be careful on the open road, and wear a helmet!)<BR>
<LI><B>Weights--</B> Get a set of hand weights and a video.  Or if you don't want to make the investment, give it a go with a couple of 1 or 2 pound bags of rice or beans (just be careful you don't puncture them and fling grains around the house).<BR>
</UL>
<center><B>Don't forget-- "Train, don't strain."  Work hard, but don't overdo it!</center></B>

<P>When we asked about your most totally embarrassing moments -- you revealed to us stories that were funny, outrageous and amazingly similar!  It just goes to show that we're all in this thing together! </P>

<center><IMG SRC="../images/rulepk.gif" BORDER=0></center><BR>

<P>
Last year in 6th grade we had a jeans day.  (When you bring in 50 cans and get to wear jeans.)  In math class I asked my teacher if I could go to the bathroom.  She said yes and I went.  While in the bathroom I took down my bun.  Which made me look like Tina Turner!  Naturally I thought everyone was going to laugh at THAT.  Well I walked in and they did laugh.  But not at THAT.  My teacher came to me and in her southren accent she said "Megan, your fly is opened!"  While in front of me I carefully zipped up my jeans!! </P>
<center><IMG SRC="../images/rulepk.gif" BORDER=0></center><BR>

<P>
When I was 12, I was on the girls' local swim team.  My mom is normally pretty cool, but can be a bit strict, I guess you could say.  Anyway, one day we were out shopping and I was bugging her for a new swimsuit that I could wear at the swim meet we had coming up later that day.  When I told her which one I wanted, she wouldn't let me have it because she said it was too revealing.  I should have known better than to push the issue but I wanted that suit.  I begged and begged but she still said no. </P>

<P>She gave me enough money to buy another suit that made me look ridiculous so I bought the one I wanted instead.   When I came downstairs in the new suit, she threw a fit that I had gotten the wrong suit.  Then she wanted me to  wear a robe since there wasn't enough time to put a different suit on.  I wouldn't do that either, because I looked silly in a robe.  None of the other girls wore them, so I wasn't going to either. </P>

<P>So, mom said that too much of my butt hung out and she wasn't going to be seen with HER daughter looking like that.  I  fussed and fussed and she totally blew up.  She grabbed me by the arm and hustled me upstairs -- I thought that she was going to make me change, but instead she hauled me to her room where she pulled out her makeup stool sat down and drug me over her lap.  She gave me the hardest spanking, then took me to the swim meet where all the other girls could see that it was plainly obvious that I had just gotten a spanking -- from the hand prints that stuck out of the sides of the suit that didn't cover much to  begin with.  The girls teased me so bad I coudn't compete.</P>

<P>For the rest of the year, they teased me about getting spanked.  Let that be a lesson girls ... Do as mom says... !!!!</P>

<center><IMG SRC="../images/rulepk.gif" BORDER=0></center><BR>
<P>
Well, in my last period class one day, it seemed like everyone was looking at me and telling secrets.  So I asked  someone what was up, and they said, "nothing". I had just started my period that week, but I decided that I'd wait until I got home to change my pad. </P>

<P>So when the class was over, I walked to my locker and asked my friend what everyone was talking about.  She said she didn't know.  But she kept trying to walk behind me.  So when I was out waiting for my bus a deaf girl from class spelled out "blood" in sign language.  I just about died.  I  went home and found blood all over the back of my jeans. </P>

<P>I called my mom at work in tears.  She said, "it's going to happen to someone and that someone is  you.  Don't worry about it; every girl goes through this at some time or another."  To this day, when I have my period I try to change my pad as often as possible.  I am so self-conscious now.  Oh and that so-called friend that acted like she didn't know what was going on; she's not my friend any longer. </P>

When I was skiing in Colorado, I was about to get off the lift of the bunny slope when my jacket got caught and I couldn't get off. By the time I got my jacket loose, I had reached the top of a black diamond slope.  Since it was my first time skiing, I just freaked out totally. </P>

<P>I decided to sit on my butt and slide down the steep slope.  I was proud of myself when I'd almost reached the bottom, but was embarassed to see my friend's cute brother applauding me.  A bunch of people were laughing at me, and I realized when I looked behind me that I had started my period.  I had left a trail behind me!  I was so horrified and refused to go out again for the rest of the week!</P>

<P>Once, at the beginning of seventh grade, my friend Rachel and I had a free hour.  We were outside on the playground, when all of a sudden I noticed that she had blood on the back of her pants!</P>
<P>"Rachel!" I hissed</P>
<P>"What?!" she asked me.</P>
<P>"You have blood on the back of your pants!" I whispered  to her.</P>
<P>So, she immediately ran inside to the bathroom.</P>
<P>Later that day, she said something to me that really made me feel good.</P>
<P>"Thanks -- I'll look out for you too."</P>

<FONT SIZE=+1> <BR>You could be featured in an upcoming "Girl Power" book!  Find out how below ...<BR><BR><BR> 

<BR><center><IMG SRC="../images/rulepk.gif"></center><BR>

<P>Hi, my name is Helen Cordes and I'd like to interview you for a book I'm writing on girls and body image. Read the info below and if you'd like to be interviewed by email, just <a href="mailto:hcordes@igc.apc.org">click here</a> to let me know!  </FONT></P>
<BR><center><IMG SRC="../images/rulepk.gif"></center>

<BR>The book will be written FOR girls aged 9-14 (or older, or younger -- whoever wants to read it!), and it's part of the "Girl Power" series from Lerner Publications in Minneapolis.  The real experts in this book are going to be girls, so I'm looking for lots of girls to tell me about their experiences and give me advice for other girls.</P>
<P>Here's what I'm going to cover in the book:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The pressure girls feel to be "pretty" and thin.<BR>
I'd like to know how you feel about how you look, and what you do to keep yourself from going crazy about your looks.<BR><BR>
<LI>Ways girls feel self-confident about their body.<BR>
Do you feel self-confident about your body (and your brain's) abilities?<BR><BR>
<LI>Ways girls feel good about how their body is changing in the teen years.<BR>
Lots of things changing below the neck, and above (ZITS!) -- how are you handling it?<BR>
</UL>
<P>That's the basics -- and I'd love to hear from you!  So if you'd like to participate, <a href="questions.html">click here</a> to read a list of questions I'd like you to think about.  You can either <a href="mailto:hcordes@igc.apc.org">email me directly</a> with your thoughts on the topics above OR, even better, <a href="mailto:hcordes@igc.apc.org">click here</a> to request to have these questions emailed to you.</P>

<BR><BR><BR><BR><strong><center>Do I have to join an insurance plan to use <br>The Women's
Pharmacy?</strong></center><P>
</CENTER>
No!  The Women's Pharmacy is for all women -- regardless of your insurance or managed
care plan.  In fact, we designed the plan primarily for the benefit of those women who
do not have prescription coverage -- as well as for those who's prescription plans do
not cover items like oral contraceptives. <P>
You may use your credit card (MasterCard, Visa, Discover) or mail in your payment for
your products.  If you do have insurance coverage for your prescription products, call
your insurance provider to determine if your plan will accept RxAmerica as a pharmacy.
<P>

<LI>If so, you can call us at 1-800-293-2202 to process your order and assist you in
filing the claim. <br>
<LI>If not, you can still use The Women's Pharmacy -- you'll just need to file the
claim directly with your insurance plan.<P><HR><BR>
<A NAME="5">
<strong> <center>What are the advantages of using <br>The Women's Pharmacy?</strong>
</center><BR>
<LI><strong>Great Prices</strong> -- Our prescription and over-the-counter product
prices are very competitive with retial drug stores.<P>
<LI><strong>Convenient Home Delivery</strong> -- Simply phone or mail in your order and
it will be processed and shipped by First Class Mail or UPS within 48 hours.<P>
<LI><strong>Private Consultations</strong> -- You can always request to speak with a
female pharmacist when you have questions about your products, prescriptions or
health.<P>
<LI><strong>Access To Pharmacists</strong> -- You'll always find the Rx America
pharmacists eager to help you.<P>
<LI><strong>Automatic Refills</strong> -- You can have your refills for such products
as oral contraceptives shipped to you automatically.<P>
<LI><strong>Women's Health Information</strong> -- You'll receive special membership
discounts from the National Women's Health Resource Center which includes their
bi-monthly newsletter on women's health.<P>
<LI><strong>Highly Qualified Pharmacists</strong> -- Your prescriptions will be filled
by registered pharmacists using one of the most technologically advanced pharmacy
systems available.<P>

<B>Ten Rules to Survive BodyShock!</B> is every girl's guide to dealing with growing up. It's an eighteen page booklet that features Angel and her best friend, Bell, learning about the "rules" of growing up -- and particularly about starting your period.  Angel finds out the truth behind the myths -- gets some advice from Bell -- and learns about all the positive things that go along with experiencing what she calls "BodyShock!"</P>

<P>If you've already experienced growing up for yourself, then <B>Ten Rules to Survive BodyShock!</B> is a perfect gift to give to any young woman or girl in your life.  Growing up is hard enough for girls these days ... why not give them something positive to read and some fun along the way?</P><HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Question 1</B><BR>
Do you like the way you look -- your face and body size?  If you mostly -- or totally -- like your looks, how does that make you feel?  If you mostly don't like your looks, how does that make you feel?</P>
<P><B>Question 2</B><BR>
Do you think that other people (your friends and classmates, your family and relatives) like the way you look?  If yes, how does that make you feel?  If no, how does that make you feel?</P>
<P><B>Question 3</B><BR>
When you think about ways to look good, where do you get your ideas (from yourself, from friends, from magazines, or TV)?</P>
<P><B>Question 4</B><BR>
Do you worry much about not looking nice enough? If you think you spend too much time worrying about your looks and body size, what things do you do to stop worrying so much?</P>
<P><B>Question 5</B><BR>
Do you know girls who worry about the way they look? If so, do you think they worry too much?</P>
<P><B>Question 6</B><BR>
Do you diet or have you dieted? Would you say that your ideas about the kinds of things you eat and how much you eat are fairly normal? Or not?</P>
<P><B>Question 7</B><BR>
What do you think are the advantages of being thin and pretty?  What are the advantages?</P>
<P><B>Question 8</B><BR>
Think about two females that you like and respect -- one who is near your age and one who is a grown-up.  Why did you pick them?  What part, if any, do you think their looks played in helping them become the person you like?</P>
<P><B>Question 9</B><BR>
Do you feel that you pretty much do what you want with your body -- at home, or at school, or wherever?  For example, when I was young, I was often told to "act like a lady" -- when I really wanted to play games with the boys, talk loudly and be the first to answer questions in class.  Do you think this kind of attitude  still exists?  Do you ever encounter it?  If so, what do you do?  Do the same behavior rules apply to boys?</P>
<P><B>Question 10</B><BR>
Do you do activities such as hiking, dance, self-defense classes, or sports?  If so, did the activity help your confidence in physical and mental ways?</P>
<P><B>Question 11</B><BR>
How do you feel about the changes that are happening or about to happen with your body, like menstruation, bigger breasts and hips? Some girls say they like looking more like a woman; others feel a little mixed about it.  What about you?</P>
<P><B>Question 12</B><BR>
If you feel pretty OK about the changes that are happening to your body, what advice would you have for girls who are feeling pretty mixed up or scared?  Where did you find your confidence -- from family, or friends, or where?</P>

WomenSpace: Birth Control Questionnaire

<BODY BGCOLOR="DEA7D4">

<FONT SIZE =+1>
<P>Exploring birth control options ... <BR><BR><BR>
In the Getting Personal area of WomenSpace, we believe in sharing information with young women to help them make important decisions -- such as whether or not to become sexually active.   Although we feel that <b>abstinence</b> is both a valid and very mature choice for young women to make -- we also realize that, today, young women need a great deal more information in order to make the best decision for themselves.  
<P>
If you've reached a point in your life -- or in your relationship  -- in which you feel you need more information about birth control options, you've probably already discovered that there are lots of things to consider -- your 
lifestyle, your relationship and the costs of the birth control methods are
just a few. 
<P>
The following interactive <strong>Birth Control Questionnaire</strong> is meant to provide you with some things to consider as you explore the contraceptive options that may be best for you.<P></FONT>
<P>

B.  I am pretty good at remembering to do things each day. <a href="bc1b.html">(Answer 1B)</a><BR>
C.  I am sometimes forgetful and often have to be reminded to do things. <a href="bc1c.html">(Answer 1C)</a><BR>

<A NAME="relate"><HR>
<strong>2. Which of the following best describes your current relationship(s)?</strong><BR>

discussed birth control. <a href="bc2a.html">(Answer 2A)</a><BR>
B.  I have had (or am having) sex with one or more partners -- but I don't
consider any of them to be "boyfriends" or steady partners.  <a href="bc2b.html">(Answer 2B)</a><BR>
C.  My boyfriend and I will probably be having sex in the near future and
we have begun to discuss birth control options. <a href="bc2c.html">(Answer 2C)</a><BR>
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="buy"><HR>
<strong>3. Who will purchase the birth control method that you and your partner use?</strong><BR>

<P><BR>
It's a cruel trick of nature that when it comes to <strong>sexually transmitted diseases</strong>, women very often get the worst end of the deal ...<P>


<P>First, STDs are more easily transmitted from a man to a woman rather than the other the other way around.  It's the mechanics of it all -- when a man and woman have sexual intercourse, the man deposits fluid into the woman's vagina.  If this fluid contains an STD, the woman is very likely to get it.  <P>
<P>
Secondly, many STDs are "asymptomatic" in women -- which means that you don't really know that you have it.  But if you don't know you have it, you probably don't know to get treatment for it either!   Unfortunately, many asymptomatic STDs can cause lots of health problems for women. <P>
<P>
All of this means that it is super crucial for women to know more about STDs.   Obviously, abstinence is the absolute best way to avoid most of of them  -- but a little education on how to spot 'em certainly doesn't hurt!  Take a look at the following STD guide and learn what some of the most common STDs look like on men and on women. <P>

<P>
The verdict is in -- it's never too early to take care of your bones!<BR><BR><BR><P> As women age, they slowly begin to loose calcium from their bones.  Over time, this leads to a weakening of your bones -- a process called <em>osteoporosis</em> (ah-ste-o-por-o-sis).

Both men and women loose around 1% of the calcium in their bones each year after the age of 40. Unfortunately, when women go through menopause, calcium loss speeds up to as much as 3-4% per year during the 4 or 5 years around the time of menopause.<P>
</FONT>
<P>So you may say, "What does this have to do with me now?" Glad you asked! There are lots of things you can do now to prevent this condition later on. <P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><strong>Excercise</strong></FONT><BR>
For instance, routine excercise will build and maintain healthly bones both now and in the future. Bones react to "stresses" from excercise by storing up calcium which makes them stronger. The more calcium your bones have now as a result of excercise, the more you'll have left over when you're older. <P>
<P>
<strong><em>Special Note:</em></strong>  Some women athletes who excercise strenuously often have a problem with amenorrhea (a-men-or-re-ah) -- which means that they stop having their periods. This can develop into a very serious situation because amenorrhea is caused by a lack of estrogen (eh-strah-jen)-- something your body really needs. In addition to lots of other good things, estrogen helps maintain adequate levels of calcium in your bones. Therefore, women with amenorrhea have a higher likelihood of getting osteoporosis.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><P><strong>Diet</strong><BR></FONT>
Excercise isn't the only way to develop strong bones and to prevent osteoporosis -- what you eat is also extremely important. Many doctors say that young women and girls should take in at least 1000 mg of calcium each day to maintain healthly bones. Elderly women and pregnant women need even more -- as much as 1500 mg. Unfortunately, most young women don't take in this amount each day.<P>
<P>
Track your diet for a few days to see if you are taking in at least 1000 mg of calcium. If you suspect that you're not getting enough, you should speak with your health care provider about taking a calcium supplement. First and foremost, though, you should try getting calcium the natural way -- through your diet.<P>
<P>
<strong><em>Special Note:</em></strong>  Sometimes the foods which are rich in calcium are also rich in fat. Some examples of these foods are cheeses, milk products, yogurts and even ice cream.  One solution to this dilemma is to buy these products in the Low-Fat or No-Fat variety. In general, moderation is the key when it comes to these foods.  Also  remember that in addition to dairy products, green, leafy vegetables can provide a great source of calcium.<P>
<P>
Here are some other foods that contain respectable amounts of calcium. <BR>
<UL>1/2 cup collard greens  --      180 mg<BR>
1 lb of fresh oysters  --     426 mg<BR>
3 oz. of salmon --     167 mg<BR>
1 cup of chopped dates --     105 mg<BR>
1 cup of orange wedges --    74 mg<BR>
1 cup of raisins --     90 mg<BR>
1 cup of rhubarb --     211 mg<BR>
1 slice of pumpernickel bread --     27 mg<BR></UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><strong>The Bottomline</strong></FONT><BR>
Once you've lost the calcium in your bones it is nearly impossible to regain it. Thus it is extremely important to take steps now in order to prevent osteoporosis. A healthly diet and regular excercise not only will make you feel and look great now, it will ensure that you feel and look great later in life too!<P>

<P>
Along with all the other not-so-subtle changes that happen to your body during puberty, one of them is the fact that your body begins to produce hair in various places -- in your armpits, in the triangle over your pubic bone --and you probably already have hair on your legs that has been there since you were small. <P>
<P>
Lots of girls begin to think about shaving at some point along the way to adulthood. But shaving can turn into quite a task once you've begun. In fact, many women choose not to shave at all!  Quite honestly, there is no real medical reason to shave -- the decision to do it is usually a cultural or social one. <P>
<P>
If it's something you've been considering, it's probably worth taking a moment to learn more about it, to speak with your mom or dad or another adult about it, and to weigh just how important it is to you. 
<P>If you've done all this and you've decided that shaving is something you want to do, take a look below at some pointers from the experts!  </FONT><P>

The Truth About
Miss Conceptions ... </CENTER>
<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<P>When I was in high school, I had a girlfriend who seemed to know everything about everything -- guys, dating, kissing, making out -- even about having sex! I'll call her Miss Conceptions for now, to protect her identity. </P> </FONT>

<P>She always seemed so mature, so worldly, so knowledgable, so sure of herself that, quite honestly, I believed her most of the time. Because I didn't have too much experience in either of these areas, I really looked up to her and the so-called advice that she gave me during that time. </P>

<P>There were lots of girls at my school who believed Miss Conceptions. In fact, one time when we had a sleep-over at her house, we stayed up all night listening to her tell stories of the worst things that could happen when you start making out with a guy.</P>

<P>Not until much later did I discover the truth about Miss Conceptions -- and the real facts about all those things that I worried about back then. As it turns out, she was just as CLUELESS as I was back then -- only she covered it up by making up crazy tales.
</P>
<P>Now that I am older and a whole lot wiser, I feel it is my duty as a fellow girl to clear up some of the myths caused by Miss Conceptions. Here are just a few of her famous words -- along with my own words of wisdom! </P>
<BR>
<A NAME="1">
<P><B>Miss Conceptions:</B>	"You can have sex without using any birth control when you have your period because you can't get pregnant then." <a href="wrong.html">(Wrong!)</a> </P>
<A NAME="2">
<P><B>Miss Conceptions:</B>	"You only have to take a birth control pill on the day you
plan to have sex in order for it to work." <a href="c'mon.html">(C'mon!)</a></P>
<A NAME="3">
<P><B>Miss Conceptions:</B>	"If you put on your brother's or your boyfriend's shorts,
you can get pregnant." <a href="noway.html">(No Way!)</a></P>
<A NAME="4">
<P><B>Miss Conceptions:</B>	"If you've been having sex with your boyfriend for a while
without using any birth control, it means that you're sterile." <a href="wrongagain.html">(Wrong again!)</a> </P>
<A NAME="5">
<P><B>Miss Conceptions:</B>	"If you jump up and down after having sex, you won't get
pregnant." <a href="getreal.html">(Get real!)</a></P>
<A NAME="6">
<P><B>Miss Conceptions:</B>	"You can't get pregnant the first time you have sex."
<a href="forgetit.html">(Forget it!)</a></P>
<A NAME="7">
<P><B>Miss Conceptions:</B>	"If I guy pulls out while you're having sex, you won't get
pregnant." <a href="getaclue.html">(Get a clue!)</a></P>
<A NAME="8">
<P><B>Miss Conceptions:</B>	"The first day you start the Pill you can have sex without
worrying about getting pregnant." <a href="wrongo.html">(Wrongo!)</a> </P>
<A NAME="9">
<P><B>Miss Conceptions:</B>	"If you use the bathroom right after having sex, you can
kill the sperm." <a href="wishful.html">(Wishful thinking!)</a></P>
<BR><BR>
If you, too, have Miss Conceptions running aroung your school, clue her in to the real facts!!

<CENTER>A special feature story ...<BR>My Pimple or My Dimple?
Which One Will They Notice?</CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>

Every day when I wake up and I never know what to expect. There is so much going on with my body, I feel like I'm on a roller coaster ... !! <P>
<P>
One day ... I got out of bed, stumbled to the bathroom, reached for my toothbrush, and THEN, suddenly, right before my eyes, I saw it!!  Right there, right smack dab in the middle of my cute little dimple was a <em> red, bulging, awful PIMPLE!</em><P>
<A NAME="1"><P>
I couldn't believe it, my very first pimple ever.   I thought I could make it all the way through high school without one. But NOOOO! It had to happen.  And it had to happen on that day -- the day when I had so much going on!! We're talkin' <a href="stress.html"><b>Stress-- with a capital S!</b></a>
<P>

At 9:00 am, I had a History report that I had to present in front of the class.  At 3:00 pm, I had try outs for chorus and then, later that night, I had my first date ever with Michael -- the boy of my dreams!! <P>  
<A NAME="2"><P>
What was I to do!!  <a href="pimplesolutions.html"><b>Scrub it? Pop it? Hide it?</b></a><P>
<P>

While trying to decide between my options, I looked in the mirror and, just for the heck of it, I pretended I had just ran into Michael:  I gave myself my most <em>dazzling</em> smile and said "Hi, Michael -- how are you?" <P>
<P>
It was amazing! When I smiled, the pimple in my dimple almost totally disappeared!!  The wider I smiled, the less you could see it. I had found my solution!!<P>
<P>
I got dressed and headed off to school. When I arrived, I put on a my best smile and wore it for the rest of the day ...<P>

When I gave my History report in front of the class, the teacher gave me a great grade for being so "enthusiastic." When I tried out for the chorus, I got a spot right away because they liked how "happily" I sang. And later that night, on my date with Michael, he told me that he loved my smile because I had beautiful <em>dimples</em>!  Can you believe it?<P>
<P>
Since that day, I haven't worried about pimples. Whenever I get them, I don't hide them, I just smile.  Afterall, they can't possibly notice my pimples when they see my great smile and dimples! <P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE =+1><CENTER>Thia's Thoughts On ...<BR>
Soap, Foam or Gel?? Which is best?</CENTER><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<em>Thia says... </em>The sacred rule of shaving is never, never dry shave!  Always lube up or you're in for a burn girl!  So here's the low down on what you can lube up with -- and which one I think is the best!<P>

<blockquote><strong>SOAP</strong> -- The good news about soap is that it's almost always available no matter where you are.  But the negative is that it can be sooo drying. (Can I get a Diet Coke here?)  You know you have to lather up so the razor will glide across your leg -- but there are alternatives to plain old body soap. <P>

<strong>SHAVING CREAM</strong> -- No doubt you've seen your dad, your brother or some macho hunk on TV with a white foamy face just before shaving -- and trusty shaving cream is their answer for a smooth shave.  But beware the smell and that bulky can.  While the Aloe scent is tolerable, you can do better girl!<P>
<strong>SHAVING GEL</strong> Now, here's where it's at!  The name <em>gel</em> says it all.  It goes on easily, out of the fem, slender can and it smells divine!  Skintemate is its name -- and a smooth shave is its super-crucial claim!  And smooth it is.  Check it out and don't shave again with out it!</blockquote><P>

What's The Deal With <B>Reality</B> --<BR> The Female Condom?<BR>This seems to be a question on lots of young women's minds these days ...<BR>
...What is it? How does it work? Where can I buy it?  Will I like it? <BR>We've heard all of these from women who've been searching for new options for protection against pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.</P>
<P>
Well, we've investigated <b>Reality</b> for you ... take a look below at what we found!</P></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+1>
Reality is the latest and the greatest in birth control options -- and is arguably the very first option women have ever to protect themselves against sexually transmitted diseases.  Let's face it, the main drawback of regular, male condoms is the fact that they are just that -- MALE condoms -- i.e., women have to have the willing participation of their partners to successfully and correctly use male condoms every time.  Finally, Reality has set in!  With the female condom the playing field has been leveled:  Women can take complete control of their protection against sexually transmitted diseases.</FONT></P>
<A NAME="1">
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>
It's Easy To Use!<BR></FONT>
Because Reality fits inside the woman's vagina -- as opposed to the outside of the man's penis -- women can take control of protection by inserting Reality ahead of time -- no erection required!  <BR><BR><CENTER><a href="reality2.html">(Click here to find out how it works ...)</a></CENTER>
<A NAME="2"><BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>
It Feels Great!<BR></FONT>
The best news yet is the fact that Reality female condoms simply feel better to both men and women than do male condoms.  Thus, the old argument women have heard for years ("I don't like to wear condoms because they don't feel natural") could be a thing of the past.  The reason that most people give for why they think Reality feels more natural than regular condoms is the fact that Reality is made of polyurethane  -- which allows body heat to be transferred more readily than latex.
<BR><BR><CENTER><a href="reality2.html#2">(Click here to read what others had to say ...)</a><BR></CENTER>
<A NAME="3"><BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>
It Puts You In Control!<BR></FONT>
Another advantage of the polyurethane is the fact that it's sturdy, yet very thin and soft -- therefore, it provides protection from even the smallest microbes that cause sexually transmitted diseases, like Hepatitis B and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  When used correctly every time, you can feel confident that you're doing a great job of protecting yourself against potential infections. 
<BR><BR><CENTER>
<a href="reality2.html#3">(Click here to find out how it protects you ...)</a><BR>
<A NAME="4"><BR></P></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>
It's Not What You Think!<BR></FONT>
When Reality first came out on the market last year, a few people commented that it looked "strange" -- and sometimes even sounded strange when you used it.  But the important thing to keep in mind is the fact that everything new and revolutionary seems strange at first!  Women haven't had a such a great new option in a long, long time -- so naturally, it takes a moment to understand Reality before using it.  It's a good idea to take the time to carefully read the instructions before putting the female condom in place.  Practice inserting it before you take it for a spin with your partner!
<BR>
<A NAME="5"><BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>
Where Can I Buy Reality?<BR></FONT>
You can find Reality in most all of the same stores you find male condoms.  You can also find them at many public health clinics.  But the easiest way to purchase <B>Reality</B> is through The Women's Pharmacy. <BR><BR>

We've updated the STD Guide from the first version of WomenSpace to include some things that many of you pointed out were missing. </CENTER></FONT>
<center><H2>Same Sex STD Alert</H2></center>
<BR>In particular, several of you commented that STD's can be spread not just from men to women -- but also from women to women as well.  In other words, it's really important to know about how to protect yourself from sexually transmitted diseases even if your partner is the same sex as you.
<P>
Any STD which has symptoms that affect the skin -- like sores from herpes or syphilis or genital warts from HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) -- can be easily spread between same sex partners.  Also, STD's which are spread through body fluids like HIV are important to know about because they can be easily passed through vaginal fluids.</P>

<P>Take a look at our STD guide and keep in mind that even if your partner is the same sex as you, it is still important to know what these STD's look like in order to protect yourself. </P>

Your quotes say it all -- there are as many opinions on wearing pantyhose as there are grrls out there!  But you may want to consider some of the health benefits and problems of wearing pantyhose before making your decision about whether you love 'em or hate 'em.  Take a closer look at <a href="hosehealth.html">the pros and cons of pantyhose.</a></FONT>

It seems you can hardly pick up a women's magazine these days without reading something about two types of devastating eating disorders that overwhelmingly plague young women -- anorexia nervosa and bulimia.  You've no doubt heard of them -- but do you really know the symptoms?  </P>
<P>If you suspect that a friend, a sister -- or even you -- may be suffering from an eating disorder, take the following quick health questionnaire.  </P>
<P>
Read the statements under each of the following five categories below.  If you can answer "yes" to more than two of the statements under each category, it may be time to take a closer look at your own health ... <BR><BR></P></FONT>

<P>Just because tampons sometimes look like rockets doesn't mean you have to be a Rocket Scientist to use them!  In fact, it's really pretty simple.  Check out the info below on the different kinds of tampons and see how we break it down for you into 5 easy steps ... no graduate degree required!</P>
<P>
<P>The first thing to know is that not all tampons are exactly alike.  Different brands have different features -- like different kinds of applicators.</CENTER>
</P><BR>
<P><img align=left src="images/cardboard.gif" BORDER=0><CENTER>For example, 
there are tampons that have <BR>cardboard applicators. The cool thing about <BR>this kind of tampon is that <BR>you can usually flush the applicator after you've used it.<BR><B>Tampax</B> is the name of a popular brand <BR>of tampons that have cardboard applicators.  </P></CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>
<img align=right src="images/plastic.gif" BORDER=0><CENTER><BR><BR>Another kind of tampon has a plastic applicator. <BR> Some girls say that plastic applicators help <BR>the tampon slide in more easily -- <BR>but you can't flush these! <BR> <b>Playtex</b> is the name of a tampon <BR>that has a plastic applicator.</P></CENTER><BR><BR>
<P><img align=left src="images/noapp.gif" BORDER=0><CENTER>And finally, there are tampons <BR>with no applicators at all -- you insert <BR>the cotton part of the tampon yourself.  <BR><b>ob</b> is the name of a popular brand of tampon <BR>that you use without an applicator.</P></CENTER><BR><BR><BR>
<HR>
Regardless of the type of tampon you use, they all work essentially the same ... the soft, cotton "plug" goes inside your vagina to catch the fluid your body releases when you have your period.<BR><BR>
<B>If you choose a tampon with an applicator, it works like this ...<BR><BR></B>
<b>1.</b>  Take the tampon out of the outer paper or plastic wrapping.  <BR>
<b>2.</b>  Use your finger to find the opening of your vagina. <BR>
<b>3.</b>  Slide the tampon applicator diagonally up inside your vagina as far as possible -- until you feel resistance. (The pointy end goes in first -- so that the string is left outside of your vagina.)<BR>
<b>4.</b>  Pull the cardboard or plastic applicator out so that the cotton is left inside your vagina.<BR><BR></FONT>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
<B>If you choose a tampon without an applicator, it works like this ...<BR><BR></B>
<b>1.</b>  Take the tampon out of the outer wrapping.<BR>
<b>2.</b>  Use your finger to find the opening of your vagina.<BR>
<b>3.</b>  Balance the cotton part of the tampon on your first or second finger.<BR>
<b>4.</b> Using your finger as a guide, slide the cotton diagonally up inside your vagina.<BR><BR></FONT>
<P><ul>Some helpful hints ...  before we get to Step #5.<BR>
*Try to relax the muscles in your vagina -- this will help the tampon slide in more easily.<BR><BR>
*If the tampon applicator doesn't slide in smoothly, put a small amount of lotion on the outside of the applicator before inserting it. <BR><BR>
*Once you've inserted the tampon, it should feel totally comfortable.  In fact, lots of times you don't feel anything at all.  If it doesn't feel comfortable, just remove it!<BR><BR>
*The tampon can not get "lost" up inside you!  It's impossible -- so don't worry about pushing it too far up!  Just make sure that you can easily retrieve the string to remove it later.<BR><BR>
*Your vagina actually sits inside your body at an angle ... so when you insert the tampon, try to angle it as if you're pushing it diagonally toward your back -- NOT straight up toward your brain!!</P><BR><BR></ul>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P>You can leave a tampon in for several hours.  (Check out the info on the box to see how long they recommend leaving it in.)  </P>
<P><B>After that time, you remove all three types of tampons exactly the same way ...<BR><BR></B>
<b>5.</b>  Grasp the string(s) that you left hanging outside your vagina and pull down gently until the cotton part of the tampon comes completely out ... then flush it!<BR><BR><BR></P>
<P>There you have it ... <b>5</b> easy steps to using tampons like the pros!  If you still have doubts -- or feel a little squeamish about the whole process -- check out our <a href="tampon.html">Tampon Chorus Line</a> and have a laugh on us!</FONT></P>

<CENTER><P>Lots of girls say they just aren't into the tampon thang -- <BR>'cause they look a little scary.  <BR><BR>But once you try 'em out, you just might find that they're the coolest thing ever to happen to menstruation! Take a closer look ...<BR><BR><BR>
<P><b>Hey, who says having your period has to be a drag?</b></P>
<IMG SRC="images/chorus.gif" BORDER=0>
<P>You can do all the same fun things you normally do -- <BR>like play sports, ride your bike, run, horseback ride, swim, dance -- <BR><b>there are no limits!</b><BR> <BR>Tampons can really help make sure that you don't worry about a thing! When you're using a tampon, you can wear shorts, bathing suits, running pants, tights <BR>... and never give another thought to whether or not anyone can "see anything."  And the best part ... you probably won't feel anything either!  </P><BR>
<P>So don't limit yourself just 'cause you have your period -- <BR><b>get out there and have some fun!</b></P></CENTER></FONT>

<P>I remember the day somebody finally <BR>clued me in on what it meant to "start my period!"  
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/what.gif" BORDER=0>
<P>I was totally like ...<BR><BR>"I'm going to do WHAT?  <BR>From WHERE? <BR>For HOW long?!!"<BR></P>
<P>And ...  as if finding out about all this<BR> wasn't bad enough, I had girls like <BR>Miss Information <BR> 
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="images/facts.gif" BORDER=0>telling me all kinds of crazy myths<BR> about starting my period ... <BR>all of which turned out to be totally false! </P>
<P>I had had enough!  So I set out on a mission to find out the facts myself!  And I'm happy to report that I've compiled them into my handy-dandy booklet called <b>Ten Rules To Survive BodyShock!</b> </P>

Check Out Eight Models' Tips for Pretty Legs.  </CENTER><P><BR><BR><BR>
<HR><CENTER>Sponsored by <BR><IMG SRC="ladypers.gif"><BR>Twin Blade Disposable Razors</CENTER>
<HR>
<strong>Warm Water</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"Be sure to use very warm water.  I've found that warmer water opens your pores and makes shaving easier.  Shaving in the bathtub is ideal, but if I have to shave in the shower, I leave it to the very last so that my skin is a little bit more soft and pliable from the steam."</blockquote><P>
<strong>Shaving Gels</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"I always like to shave with plain soap and water, but I find I get much smoother results if I stick with a shaving gel, preferably one with a skin softener built in, like lanolin.  There's even a few that are specifically designed for women, and they're really good."</blockquote>
<P>
<strong>Razor Edge</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"The best advice I ever got on shaving was from my first modeling agent.  She told me to change my razor every few shaves.  A new razor gives you a clean, rust-free edge."</blockquote>
<P>
<strong>Shaving Direction</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"When I'm shaving my legs I always shave against the direction that the hair grows.  In other words, I pull the razor upwards.  But fo the bikini area or the underarms it's absolutely necessary to shave with the hair direction.  Otherwise, you'll get ingrown hairs and that's miserable."</blockquote>
<P>
<strong>Difficult Spots</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"It took me forever to figure out how to really shave my knees.  Eventually, I discovered that if I bent my knees I could get a smoother surface to run the razor over.  Then I make several small, careful strokes up to the knee cap.  Sometimes I have to pull the skin slightly to get a more shaveable surface."</blockquote><P>
<strong>Underarms</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"Shaving underarms is pretty tricky, but by no means impossible.  Best bet is to use a mirror to get a really good view of where your razor is going.  Sometimes I have to actually get out of the shower or tub to look into the mirror over the sink.  But it really makes a difference."</blockquote><P>
<strong>Get A Grip</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"Soapy hands in the shower means slippery razzors -- and that's just a nick waiting to happen.  I try to keep my hands rinsed clean of soap or shaving cream."</blockquote><P>
<strong>Lotion</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"Right after I get out of the shower, I put lotion on my legs ... I only dry them a little and that way the lotion really sinks in and softens.  Some prefer baby oil, but I like lotion."</blockquote>

Describing You...<BR><BR>
<P>
If you consider yourself to be a "creature of habit", birth control pills
(oral contraceptives) may be an excellent choice for you...   
<P>You must take
one pill each and every day.  Depending on the prescription, there is one
Pill for every day of the month -- including during your period. The Pills
that you take while you have your period are to help you keep track of
where you are in your cycle and remind you when it is time to begin a new
pack.

<P>
The Pills come pre-arranged in a package and must be taken in the sequence
in which they are lined up.  The package will help you remember which day
you are on -- but it's up to you to remember to look inside the package
each day and take the Pill.<P>
<P>
Birth control pills can prevent pregnancy up to 99% of the time -- but
only if you take the Pill every day -- and at the same time each day.  The
more closely you follow this rule the more confident you can be that you
are getting the Pill's highest effectiveness against pregnancy.<P>
<P>
Some medicatons such as antibiotics can interfere with the effectiveness of
the Pill.  Whenever you visit your health care provider, always let her or
him know that you are on the Pill.<P>
<P>
One last thing -- because the Pill works by preventing your ovaries from
releasing eggs (ovulation) -- you must take the Pill for at least one full
month before your body is fully accustomed to it.  Therefore, plan to factor this
month in when you are determining how long you must wait for the Pill to
take affect -- and use another form of birth control in the meantime.<P>
<P>
Although the Pill works well for a lot of women -- but plenty of others find that their bodies cannot tolerate them due to the hormones.  So if you're considering birth control pills, talk with your health care provider about their side effects. <P>
Birth control pills are great at preventing pregnancy -- but they don't
protect you against sexually transmitted diseases.  Always use condoms for this kind of protection!<P>

Describing You...
<P>
If you are pretty good at remembering to do things each day -- you're
probably a candidate for using a birth control method like the Pill
(oral contraceptives).  However, the most important thing to realize is
that in order for the Pill to be the most effective,  you must take the
Pill every day -- and at the same time each day.  The more closely you
follow this rule the more confident you can be that you are getting the
Pill's highest effectiveness against pregnancy.<P>

<blockquote><strong>Effectiveness Rate:</strong>  Birth control pills can protect against pregnancy as much as 99% if used
correctly.<P></blockquote>
<P>
Depending on the prescription, there is one Pill for every day of the month
-- including during your period. The Pills that you take while you have
your period are to help you keep track of where you are in your cycle and
remind you when it is time to begin a new pack.<P>
<P>
The Pills come pre-arranged in a package and must be taken in the sequence
in which they are lined up.  The package will help you remember which day
you are on -- but it's up to you to remember to look inside the package
each day and take the Pill.  Therefore, you should try to associate taking
your pill with another routine part of your day -- like brushing your teeth
for bed or taking a shower in the morning.  It doesn't matter which
activity you choose -- or when you choose to do it -- as long as you do it
at the same time every day.<P>
<A NAME="1">
<strong>Other Methods:</strong>  If this seems like it may not be a realistic thing for you to remember, not
to worry!  There are several other methods that you can consider.  For
instance, there are methods of birth control that you use only when you
plan to have sex -- and then there are those methods which are more
"permanent" or "long term".<P>
<P>
Methods like condoms and spermicidal foams, gels, creams and suppositories
are easy birth control methods in that they can be purchased ahead of time.  But even this takes a little planning.<P>
<P>
<blockquote><strong> Effectivess Rate:</strong> Spermicides range in effectiveness from 79% to 97%. </blockquote><P>
Spermicides work best when
used with another method -- like a condom -- which also protects you from sexually transmitted diseases.<P>
<blockquote><strong> Effectivess Rate:</strong> The condom's effectiveness ranges between 88% and 98%.</blockquote>
<P>
The withdrawal method -- when the man pulls his penis out of the woman's vagina before he
ejaculates -- is one method which doesn't require a trip to the drugstore.  However,
it isn't a very effective method for preventing pregnancy. 
<blockquote><strong>Effectiveness Rate:</strong>  The withdrawal method can be up to 82% effective for the typical couple.<P></blockquote>

The "rhythm" method is another natural means of birth control.  It requires the woman to track her body temperature and menstrual cycle in order to predict when she will ovulate.  With this method for birth control, you abstain from having sex during the days surrounding ovulation.  Though this is a widely accepted method for birth control, it does not provide the highest levels of effectiveness -- because it's difficult to predict exactly when you ovulate.
<blockquote><strong> Effectivess Rate:</strong>  The rhythm method can be up to 80% effective. </blockquote>
<P>
Birth control methods such as a diaphragm, cervical cap or the sponge are
considered "barrier" methods because you place them inside your vagina to
cover your cervix.  They physically prevent the sperm from entering your
uterus. These options are pretty effective.  However, your health
care provider must fit you with a diaphragm or a cervical cap -- and both require that you
use a spermicidal foam or jelly along with them to receive the most
effectiveness against pregnancy.<P>
<P>
<blockquote><strong>Effectiveness Rates:</strong>  The diaphagm's effectiveness varies between 81% and 97%.  The cervical cap's effectiveness ranges from 73% to 92%.  The sponge's effectiveness varies between 75% and 83%.  </blockquote> <P>

Diaphragms and cervical caps work like this -- you place a
specified amount of the spermicidal jelly or cream inside the diaphragm or
the cervical cap before placing it inside your vagina.  The spermicide can
last for several hours -- therefore you could feasibly put in the diaphragm
or cervical cap with the spermicide way ahead of the time that you plan to
have sex. You have to leave the diaphragm and the cervical cap in for at
least 6 to 8 hours after the last time you have sex to prevent any sperm
that may still be alive in your vagina from going through your cervix.  If
you decide to have sex again during this time, you have to reinsert
additional spermicide.<P>
<P>
After 6 to 8 hours, you can remove, wash and store the diaphragm or the
cervical cap until you choose to use it again.<P>
<P>
The sponge is a very convenient "barrier" method to use.  The first great thing about the sponge is that you don't need a
prescription to use it -- you can purchase them at the drug store.   The
second great thing is that it is effective for 24 hours once you've
inserted it.  Like the diaphragm and the cerival cap, you have to leave it
in for at least 6 hours after the last time you have sex.<P>
<P>
Because there is a certain amount of planning and "maintenance" required
when using a diaphragm, a cervical cap and the sponge, some women feel that these are better methods to use when you have a partner with whom you communicate well. The reason for this is because there are time constraints involved -- and some say this decreases spontaneity.  Also, the fact that you have to reinsert spermicide each time you have sex with a diaphragm or a cervical cap means that a certain amount of communication with your partner is required.<P>
<P>
There are birth control methods that are "longer term" and/or more
"permanent" that are options for you.  The IUD is a device inserted into your uterus by your
health care provider which can be removed at a later point in time. 
You also have the option of contraceptive implants which are 
surgically inserted usually into the underside of your upper arm.  This method
releases hormones very similar to that of the Pill and can be very
effective against pregnancy for up to five years -- at which time you have
it removed and replaced if you want to continue with the method. 
<P>
A third,
longer term method is an injectable contraceptive.  With this method, you
receive an injection from your health care provider which can be effective
against pregnancy for up three months.   At that time, you have to return
to your health care provider to get an additional injection if you want to
continue with that method.<P>
<P>
<blockquote><strong>Effectiveness Rates:</strong>  The IUD, contraceptive implants and injectable contraceptives all can be as effective as 99%.  </blockquote>
<P>
Finally --  but certainly just as important -- you also have the option of
tubal ligation as a method of birth control.  Tubal ligation -- also called
"having your tubes tied" and "sterilization" --  is a surgical procedure in
which your fallopian tubes are either clamped or cut to prevent the eggs
from traveling from your ovaries to your uterus.  Most people consider this
method to be permanent -- although there have been women who have had the
procedure reversed.  Regardless, it is an extremely effective method
against pregnancy.<P>
<P>
<blockquote><strong>Effectiveness Rates:</strong>  Tubal ligation can be as effective as 99.8%.<P></blockquote>
<P>
Just keep in mind that all the methods mentioned above -- the spermicides,
diaphragms, cervical caps, IUDs, contraceptive implants, injectables and
tubal ligation -- do not protect you from STDs.  Condoms used alone or in
conjunction with one of these methods increases your protection against
both pregnancy and STDS.<P>

Describing You...<BR><BR>
<P>
If you already realize that you are often forgetful, chances are you
aren't the best candidate for a method such as birth control pills.
However, this doesn't mean that you can't choose this method -- it just
means that you will have to make a conscious, concerted effort to remember
to take the Pill. <P>

For the Pill to be the most effective,  you must take the Pill every day --
and at the same time each day.  The more closely you follow this rule the

Your Relationship...<BR><BR><P>

If you've already made the decision to have sexual intercourse with your new partner, you
have a few things to consider:  <BR><a href="bc2a.html#1">(1) will you be having sexual intercourse
with this partner frequently?</a>; <BR><a href="bc2a.html
#2">(2) how well do you communicate with your
partner</a>; and <BR><a href="bc2a.html#3">(3) what is your partner's sexual history?</a>
<P>
<A NAME="1">
<b>(1)</b>  A consideration of the frequency with which you will have
intercourse is important because you may find that you
want a "longer-term" birth control option that is very effective against
pregnancy -- but that doesn't require a special trip to the drugstore each time you plan to have sexual intercourse.  

For longer-term methods which provide you with "every-day" protection against pregnancy,  the Pill is a great method -- but it
requires a certain degree of commitment on your part. 
You must remember to take the Pill everyday -- at the same time everyday.<P>
<P>
You also have the option of an injectable contraceptive -- which is a "shot" or
injection you receive from your health care provider.  Another option are 
contraceptive "capsules" that you have implanted by your health care
provider.<P>
<P>
<blockquote><strong>Length of Effectiveness:</strong>  Injectable contraceptives are effective for up to three months.
Contraceptive implants are effective for up to five years.</blockquote>
<P>
Although the Pill has an extremely low failure rate -- the biggest issue
to consider is that you must remember to take the Pill every single day.
The other two types of contraceptives -- both injectables and implants --
provide you with continuous protection. You don't have to "remember" to
take them -- they're already there!<P>
<P>
The IUD is a "longer-term" birth control method that can be very effective
against pregnancy for many years but can be removed at a later point.   Tubal ligation is
the most "long-term" method of birth control in that most people consider
it to be "permanent." Regardless, it is an extremely effective method
against pregnancy.<P>
<P>
Just keep in mind that all the methods mentioned above -- the Pill,
spermicides, diaphragms, cervical caps, IUDs, contraceptive implants,
injectables and tubal ligation -- do not protect you from STDs.  Condoms
used alone or in conjunction with one of these methods increases your
protection against both pregnancy and STDs.<P>
<P>
<A NAME="2">
<b>(2)</b>  Since neither you nor your partner have brought up the subject of birth
control yet -- it's important for you to consider what methods are
available to you -- and which methods are within your control.   For
instance, methods like the Pill are typically under the complete control of
the woman.  It's up to you to ensure that they are used correctly.  Other
methods like the diaphragm, cervical cap, sponge and spermicides generally
require some degree of communication between you and your partner in order
to use them effectively.  If you don't think that you have very good
communication with your partner -- these methods may or may not be your best birth
control option.<P>
<P>
BUT -- regardless of how well you communicate with your partner on the
topic of birth control or pregnancy -- it is extremely important for you to communicate with him about using a condom to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. 
<P>
<A NAME="3">
<b>(3)</b>  A third consideration to make when deciding on a method of birth
control is your partner's sexual history.  With any new partner, you have to
realize that despite how confident you are in your current relationship,
your new partner may have had sex (whether vaginal, anal or oral) with
another person at some point in the past that could put your at risk for an STD -- regardless of what he tells
you.<P>
<P>
Talking with your partner about sexually transmitted diseases may be
difficult  -- but you have to take precautions to protect yourself -- just
in case!<P>
<P>
What this means is that -- in addition to protection against pregnancy --
you also must protect yourself against sexually transmitted diseases.  In
general, condoms are an excellent choice because they
provide both forms of protection.  However, condoms can only work to
protect when you purchase the correct kind and when you use them correctly.<P>

Latex condoms are the best because they are the most durable and because
they do not allow the tiny organisms of some STDs to come through.  Condoms
made from such materials as lamb skin tend to be more fragile and do not
stop such viruses as HIV and Hepatitis B from going through.<P>

You should store condoms in a cool area.  If your boyfriend (partner) keeps them in
his wallet or in his back pocket, the condom material may "break down" due
to the heat.  Always make sure that the condom is still good by
checking the expiration date on the package.  Finally, never use lubricants
such as petroleum jelly with condoms because this can also "break down" the latex.  The
best lubricant choice is a water-based variety such as KY Jelly.<P>
<P>
Keep in mind that there are certain forms of STDs like Herpes or Syphilis which can be spread by touching an open sore.  Unfortunately, these sores can
sometimes be in places that condoms don't cover -- such as the areas around
the genitals and the anus.  Condoms alone cannot protect you from these
types of sores; therefore, you should look out for them and avoid
direct contact with them.<P>
<P>
Remember that condoms aren't just for sexual intercourse -- they should
also be used for oral or anal sex -- particularly when your partner has an STD or
you see any open sores on or around his penis.<P>
<P>
One last point to consider -- for many, many  years condoms were considered
the "male contraceptive" because the man wears them and often the man was
the one who purchased them.  Today, women not only take the initiative to
purchase "male" condoms themselves -- but they also have the option of
purchasing "female" condoms.  These condoms fit into the vagina and are
held in place by a flexible ring that remains outside the body to cover the
exposed areas of the woman's genitals.  The "female" condom gives women
more choices and more control over pregnancy and sexually transmitted
diseases.<P>

Your Relationship...<BR><BR><P>

When choosing a method of birth control -- it is very important to consider
the reality of sexually transmitted diseases and learn how to prevent them.  If
you are sexually active with a partner whose 
sexual history you do not know well, you should go ahead and assume that this
person may have a sexually transmitted disease.  Condoms are your first
line of defense in this situation -- and they are an excellent choice for
both birth control and protection against STDs.  You can easily purchase
them yourself and they are fairly inexpensive.<P>
<P>
Purchasing condoms yourself  -- as opposed to relying on your partner to
have them -- is really the best way to go.  Until you have developed a
relationship in which you can communicate with your partner(s) about who
will purchase the birth control, you owe it to yourself to always be
prepared.<P>
<P>
Fully protecting yourself against STDs is the first step -- the second
thing to consider is the effectiveness of the birth control method.  Latex
condoms can be pretty effective in preventing pregnancy when you use them
correctly.<P>
<P>
<blockquote><strong> Effectivess Rate:</strong> The condom's effectiveness ranges between 88% and 98%.</blockquote>
<P>
However, you may decide that you want even more certainty in the type of
birth control method you choose.<P>
<P>
The Pill, contraceptive implants and contraceptive injections are all
excellent choices for high levels of effectiveness against pregnancy. Each
of these methods require a visit to your health care provider.<P>
<P>All of these methods work by manipulating the levels of the
hormones in your body which control ovulation.  Some women feel that these
methods may be "too much trouble" or "too long-term"  -- especially when
they aren't in long-term relationships. Some women choose not to use
these types of hormonal birth control methods because they have side-effects from the hormones.<P>
<P>
You also have the choice of a diaphragm or a cervical cap. However, it is important to keep in
mind that these methods require a certain amount of communication with your
partner in order to use them effectively every time.  Again, many women
feel that these methods may not be the best when in a new
relationship.<P>
<P>
Longer-term methods such as the IUD and more permanent methods such as
tubal ligation are also valid birth control options.  It is important to
realize that, in the case of tubal ligation, the method is considered permanent.  Therefore, over the short-term, this may not be the best choice of birth control methods.<P>
<P>
One last thing ... the higher the number of sexual partners you have, the
higher the likelihood of picking up a sexually transmitted disease.  Some
STDs -- like Chlamydia -- can go unnoticed for a long period of time in
women.  Even though Chlamydia can be "symptom-less", it can cause severe
damage to your body.  Take good care of yourself if you choose
to have more than one sexual partner  -- and always protect yourself by
using condoms.<P>

Your Relationship...
<BR><BR>
<P>
Because you and your partner are both great planners and communicators, you
have numerous birth control options available to you.  But before exploring
these options, you should take some time to think about how much you know
about your partner's sexual past.<P>
<P>
Regardless of how well you believe you know your partner, it is still
important to bring up the topic of your sexual histories -- and to consider the importance of 
using condoms as a protection against sexually transmitted diseases.   Take
advantage of how well you communicate with him about birth control -- and
determine your need to use condoms.<P>
<P>
In terms of birth control, first consider whether you feel more comfortable
with methods that you use only while you are having sex -- or methods
that require more planning but offer long-term protection.<P>
<P>
Such methods as condoms, spermicidal suppositories, foams, gels and
creams are easy birth control methods in that (1) they can be easily purchased ahead of time; (2) you use them only when you have sexual intercourse, and (3) when used with other methods like condoms or the Pill, they
can be very effective in preventing pregnancy.<P>
<P>
The withdrawal method in which the man pulls out his penis from the women's vagina before he
ejaculates is one method which doesn't require a special trip to the drugstore --
but also doesn't give very effective method for preventing pregnancy.
Failure rates for the withdrawal method can be as high as 18% for the
typical couple.<P>
<P>
Birth control methods such as a diaphragm, cervical cap and the sponge are
excellent methods for couples that communicate well together.  In order to
get the high effectiveness rates of the diaphragm and the cervical cap, you
must use a specified amount of spermicide with the device.  Each time you
have sex, you reinsert more spermicide -- and you must leave the
diaphragm and the cervical cap in for at least 6 to 8 hours after the last
time you have intercourse.  With this amount of planning, you can see that
it is best if you and your partner can work together in making sure that
you have used these methods correctly.<P>
<P>
The sponge works in much the same way -- except that the spermicide is
inside the sponge itself.  There is no need to reapply spermicide; however
you do need to leave the sponge in for at least 6 to 8 hours after the last
time you have sex.<P>
<P>
Birth control methods like the Pill, contraceptive implants and
contraceptive injections are all excellent choices for high levels of
effectiveness against pregnancy.  However, each of these methods require a
visit to a health care provider.   Because methods like the Pill work by
preventing your ovaries from releasing eggs (ovulation) -- you must take
the Pill for at least one full month before your body is accustomed to it.
Therefore, plan to factor this month in when you are determining how long
you must wait for the Pill to take affect -- and use another form of
contraceptive in the meantime.<P>

Who will purchase ...<BR><BR>
<P>
If you plan to use a method of birth control such as condoms, spermicidal
jellies or suppositories, it's very simple for your partner to
purchase them -- because you don't need a prescription for any of these.
<P>
Each of these methods can cost anywhere from a nickel for a condom at a
public health center up to $10.00 or more for some jellies, creams
and suppositories.<P>
<P>
If your partner is in charge of purchasing these
products, you should consider what you to do if he should forget to buy
them.  If you discover that he does not have
some birth control while you are in the process of having sex ... will you
continue anyway?   -- will you stop and ask that he purchase something
before going any further?   -- will you purchase them yourself?
<P>
It is great if your partner shares in the expense of buying birth control
-- but you must weigh the benefits of this against the fact that you are
relying on him to protect <em>you.</em>  Though he may care about you very much --
you should always look out for yourself by purchasing back-up
contraceptives just in case he should forget.  That way, you both share in
the responsibility of your decision to have sexual intercourse.
<P>
If you choose one of the other methods we've discussed along the way (the
Pill, diaphragm, cervical cap, contraceptive implants, etc.), it is
important to look into the costs associated with using each one.  You'll
also want to factor in the cost of going to your health care provider to
get an examination for these types of birth control.<P>
<P>
If you have places near you such as a Planned Parenthood, a women's health or
student health clinic, you'll probably find that they can be much less expensive than other places -- if not free!  They provide excellent care and are a great resource for information about birth control and STDs.<P>
FYI -- Though the cost of birth control may seem expensive to you at times, it is certainly safer and less expensive than an unwanted pregnancy.  So take care of yourself by looking into all the birth control methods available.<P>

<P>
If you know that you will be the primary person responsible for purchasing the the birth control method that you
and your partner choose, it is important to look into the costs associated
with using each one.<P>

For instance, birth control pills can cost as little as a few dollars each month if you purchase them at a student health public clinic -- or they can cost as much as $20 or $30 per month at a retail drug store.  You'll also need to get a prescription for birth control pills which will require a visit to your health care provider.  Again, this cost may vary depending on where you go for an examination. <P>
Other methods such as condoms do not require you to get an examination from your health care provider but the cost of using them can add up.  Depending on where you purchase them, you can expect to pay around $5.00 for a package of six condoms.  So, from this, you can determine how much you will spend on condoms each time you have sexual intercourse. <P>
The important thing to realize is that having "safe and protected sex" isn't always "cheap".  Therefore, before making the decision to have sexual intercourse -- take just a moment to determine if your budget will always allow you to have access to the birth control method you choose. <P>

FYI -- Though the cost of birth control may seem expensive to you at times, it is certainly safer and less expensive than an unwanted pregnancy.  So take care of yourself by looking into all the birth control methods available.<P>

<P>
Sharing in the cost of the birth control method is a fantastic way for the
both of you to take equal responsibility for your decision to become
sexually active.  As you explore the various birth control methods
available to you and your partner, take a look at the costs associated with
using each of them -- and speak with your partner about how much you think each of you can expect to spend. <P>
For instance, birth control pills can cost as little as a few dollars each month if you purchase them at a student health public clinic -- or they can cost as much as $20 or $30 per month at a retail drug store.  You'll also need to get a prescription for birth control pills which will require a visit to your health care provider.  Again, this cost may vary depending on where you go for an examination. <P>

<HR>

1.  Don't shave as soon as you get up in the morning.  Everyone's skin is a little puffy first thing.  Wait for at least half an hour and you will get a better shave. <P>
2.  Shower or bathe before you shave.  Soak legs / underarms in a luxurious warm bath or shower for two to three minutes.   Use lots of soap and water.  That softens and expands the hairs making them easier to remove.<P>
3.  Use soap or a shaving preparation like moisturised cream or gel.  Apply liberally.  Smooth the gel upwards from the ankles to help the hairs stand up ready for shaving.<P>
4.  Use a sharp blade.  Make sure you change it often enough (for most women this is afer one or two sessions) since a blunt blade will pull and irritate the skin.  Never wipe the blade with a cloth or towel as this will damage the blade.  Simply shake and leave to dry.<P>
5.  Using a light touch, shave with, and then against the growth using short strokes.  Rinse the razor frequently.  Check with your fingers to be sure you have the smooth close feeling. <P>
6.  After shaving, many women finish with a moisturizing lotion for a silky smooth feeling. <P>

<P>
Why shave with a razor instead of shaving with an electric razor, waxing or using hair removal chemicals??  Because the experts say ...<BR><P>
<b>Wet Shaving</b> is truly the modern way; clean, fresh and hygienic.  You can shave as part of the daily routine of washing in bath or shower.  Best of all, it leaves your skin smooth and silky to the touch. <P>
An added plus is the removal of old, dry dead skin cells which leaves your skin feeling fresh and smooth.  <P>
Wet shaving is gaining in popularity worldwide mainly because beauty therapists and research by dermatologists indicate that wet shaving is not only quicker, but is more effective, more hygienic and less harmful to your skin in the long term.
<P>
Some people believe that wet shaving makes hair grow back more quickly when compared to other methods.  There is no evidence to support this.

<HR><CENTER>Sponsored by <BR><IMG SRC="ladypers.gif"><BR>Twin Blade Disposable Razors</CENTER>
<HR>
<strong>Warm Water</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"Be sure to use very warm water.  I've found that warmer water opens your pores and makes shaving easier.  Shaving in the bathtub is ideal, but if I have to shave in the shower, I leave it to the very last so that my skin is a little bit more soft and pliable from the steam."</blockquote><P>
<strong>Shaving Gels</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"I always like to shave with plain soap and water, but I find I get much smoother results if I stick with a shaving gel, preferably one with a skin softener built in, like lanolin.  There's even a few that are specifically designed for women, and they're really good."</blockquote>
<P>
<strong>Razor Edge</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"The best advice I ever got on shaving was from my first modeling agent.  She told me to change my razor every few shaves.  A new razor gives you a clean, rust-free edge."</blockquote>
<P>
<strong>Shaving Direction</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"When I'm shaving my legs I always shave against the direction that the hair grows.  In other words, I pull the razor upwards.  But fo the bikini area or the underarms it's absolutely necessary to shave with the hair direction.  Otherwise, you'll get ingrown hairs and that's miserable."</blockquote>
<P>
<strong>Difficult Spots</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"It took me forever to figure out how to really shave my knees.  Eventually, I discovered that if I bent my knees I could get a smoother surface to run the razor over.  Then I make several small, careful strokes up to the knee cap.  Sometimes I have to pull the skin slightly to get a more shaveable surface."</blockquote><P>
<strong>Underarms</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"Shaving underarms is pretty tricky, but by no means impossible.  Best bet is to use a mirror to get a really good view of where your razor is going.  Sometimes I have to actually get out of the shower or tub to look into the mirror over the sink.  But it really makes a difference."</blockquote><P>
<strong>Get A Grip</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"Soapy hands in the shower means slippery razzors -- and that's just a nick waiting to happen.  I try to keep my hands rinsed clean of soap or shaving cream."</blockquote><P>
<strong>Lotion</strong><BR>
<blockquote>"Right after I get out of the shower, I put lotion on my legs ... I only dry them a little and that way the lotion really sinks in and softens.  Some prefer baby oil, but I like lotion."</blockquote>

<CENTER>What to shave, <BR>what not to shave <BR>and where! ... <BR>some general pointers.<BR><BR><BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="1"><center><b>What to Shave</b></center><BR>
The areas that women choose to shave vary pretty widely -- some women only shave their armpits and not their legs, others only shave their calves and not their thighs, some women shave the outer areas of their pubic hair. <P>
<P>
If you have very fine or light-colored hair on your legs, you may find no reason to shave them at all.  Many <em>moms</em> prefer that their daughters only shave their calves in the beginning. Sometimes, women decide to shave more extensively in the summer when they wear bathing suits, shorts and tank tops. <P>
<P>
What to shave is a very personal decision -- there is no right or wrong way. But it may be best to choose a small area first to get an idea of just how much work -- and maintenance -- is involved before deciding to shave everything!!<P>
<P>
<A NAME="2"><center><B>What Not to Shave</B></center><BR>
<strong>Don't shave your mustache</strong>:  Although you may find that the hair above your
lip may become darker as you go through puberty, we don't recommend shaving it. Often, shaving this hair can result in it becoming darker and coarser when it grows back. Other solutions to this "mustache" problem are to wax it or to bleach it. Both of these methods can be purchased in the drug store -- or you can go to a salon to have it done. Waxing can be a little painful but it usually takes care of the mustache for as long as four weeks. <P>

<strong>Don't shave your eyebrows</strong>: Most razors aren't small enough to be as precise as you need for your eyebrows -- not to mention that it probably isn't a good idea to put something as sharp as razor near your eyes. If you want to shape your eyebrows, you have a couple of options -- plucking them or waxing them. Both of these methods can be a little painful so you may want to skip them completely. Many fashion magazines -- and lots of adult women -- believe that natural eyebrows are the most attractive.
<P>

<A NAME="3"><center><b>Where To Shave</b></center><BR>
One shaving decision to make is whether to do it in the shower or in the tub. Shaving in the shower takes good balance -- and some extra care so that you don't slip. Some women place one foot on the side of the tub and bend down to shave.  Just make sure that your feet are firmly planted in an area that isn't soapy or slippery.<P>
<P>
Shaving in the tub requires less balance -- but make sure that your hands are not soapy so that you can hold the razor securely. Some women choose to shave separately from bathing -- by sitting on the side of the tub. This can give you more stability.<P>

"bragging" just to cover up.  <BR>Don't fall for it -- make your own decision!<P>

No doubt about it, your raging hormones can <BR>sometimes force you into
making a spur <BR>of the moment decision.  <BR>Take a deep breath and think
carefully .... <BR>how well do you really know him? -- or his sexual past?<BR>
Think now to avoid regretting later.<P>

Though it is true that when you have your period you are shedding the lining in your uterus which contains the egg that your ovaries released that month, it does not guarantee you that the egg can't be fertilized. Therefore, it isn't surprising that there are a significant number of women who do get pregnant as a result of having unprotected sex while they have their periods. </FONT>

<P>Birth control pills are made up of hormones that essentially "trick" your ovaries into not releasing an egg. Just as it takes your body a whole month to complete its hormonal cycle for menstruation, birth control pills take an entire month to fully control your ovaries. Therefore, you have to take a pill every single day -- at the same time everyday for the pill to be effective.</P></FONT>

<P>If you been having sex with your boyfriend for a while without using any birth control and you haven't gotten pregnant-- it probably just means you're very lucky. There is some chance that you have been having sex during the times of the month in which your ovaries have not produced an egg. But this is certainly not something with which you will want to roll the dice.  If you do not want to get pregnant, check into some of the methods of birth control available to you within our Birth Control Questionnaire. 
</P>

<P>Though the likelihood of you (or your boyfriend) being sterile is pretty slim, a trip to your gynecologist or health care provider can help you determine if you are, in fact, unable to become pregnant. </FONT>

<P>The thinking behind this one stems from the idea that jumping up and down will keep the sperm from swimming through your cervix and from reaching the egg. Although sperm are small, they are stubborn! Chances are, they'll get where they're going regardless of any gymnastics. Besides, you could look pretty ridiculous using this as a method of birth control!!</P></FONT>

<P>This one is just NOT true. There are lots of women who've had this exact scenario happen. Generally speaking, if you have had your first period -- then your ovaries are producing an egg each and every month. This egg slowly moves from your ovaries, to your fallopian tubes, to your uterus -- where it sits and waits to be fertilized. This process will happen regardless of whether you're having sex or not. So if during this time you have sex for the first time, you are very likely to fertilize that egg -- in other words, get pregnant!!</P>

<P>(PS -- There have been studies which have shown that some young women who have had sex or who have been raped before they had their first period became pregnant. Though details on this subject are sketchy -- it is better to go on the wisdom that you can, indeed, get pregnant the first time you have sex.) </FONT>

<P>This method of birth control is called the "withdrawal" method and it means that the guy pulls his penis out of your vagina before he ejaculates (has an orgasm). Though many people consider this to be a valid form of birth control, it is simply untrue to say that you "can't" get pregnant when you use this method. In fact, the failure rate with this method can be quite high. </P>

<P>The reason for this is twofold: (1) Guys often have a small amount of "pre-ejaculation" fluid way before they have the real ejaculation -- both of which contain sperm. (2) Many guys aren't very good at controlling the timing with the withdrawal method. It is often difficult for them to know exactly when to "pull out" and, as a result, they may "pull out" too late. The result could be that some sperm is deposited into your vagina. </FONT>

<BR><BR>
Many gynecologists recommend that you take a full cycle of birth control pills before you rely on them as your primary method of birth control. A "full cycle" means that you take a complete pack of the pills (which is an entire month) and then have your next period. Only after that point will your body have had time to adjust to the effects of the hormones in the Pills.</FONT>

<CENTER>Wishful thinking!</CENTER>
<BR><BR>

<P>This myth is probably a result of someone not understanding women's anatomy too well!! When you have sex, the guy deposits sperm into your vagina. From there, the sperm swim up through your cervix and into your uterus. These parts of your body (your vagina, your cervix, your uterus) are in no way connected to your urinary tract or your gastro-intestinal tract. Thus, using the bathroom after having sex really won't do anything to "kill the sperm."</P>

<P>One addtional theory on this myth might be that when you sit down to use the bathroom, some of the ejaculation fluid which contains sperm may run out. Though it may be true that the sheer force of gravity will cause some of the fluid to come out, there are still millions of sperm that could still be inside your vagina.

<CENTER>Stress -- With A Capital "S"!</CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>

Although doctors don't have a good explanation about why stress cause pimples -- one thing is for sure --  alot of young women say that when they're under alot of stress or anxiety, they are more likely to get them.

But stress isn't the main cause of pimples -- the amount of oil your skin produces is usually the primary culprit!  When your skin produces lots of oil, your pores can become clogged.  So try to have a daily routine of cleaning your face, neck and chest to remove excess oils and dead skin.

<FONT SIZE =+1><CENTER>What should she do?<BR>
Scrub It? Pop It? Hide It?</CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>
Other than washing and cleaning your face, your best option for pimples is to leave them alone. Popping them can cause your skin to scar. It can also cause the pimple to become even redder and maybe even hang around alot longer. <P>

<P>If you notice that the pimple has a "white head" on it, it means that the pore has produced an excess of something called "sebum" (see-bum).  This sebum can clog the pore and lead to an infection -- which means that a there is pus underneath the skin. 
<P>
Sometimes washing a "white head" with a washcloth or a lightly abrasive scrub can help by releasing the sebum and pus.  But don't scrub too hard -- just enough to gently wash away the dead skin.<P>

<P>As far as hiding it, you're best bet may be an acne medication that comes in a "flesh tone."  Using a lot of make-up or cosmetic powder might hide it, but it certainly won't help heal it.  It's better to let it "breath" than cover it with too much make-up.<P>

Soap, Foam or Gel?? Which is best?</CENTER><BR><BR><BR>
<P>
<em>Thia says... </em>The sacred rule of shaving is never, never dry shave!  Always lube up or you're in for a burn girl!  So here's the low down on what you can lube up with -- and which one I think is the best!<P>

<blockquote><strong>SOAP</strong> -- The good news about soap is that it's almost always available no matter where you are.  But the negative is that it can be sooo drying. (Can I get a Diet Coke here?)  You know you have to lather up so the razor will glide across your leg -- but there are alternatives to plain old body soap. <P>

<strong>SHAVING CREAM</strong> -- No doubt you've seen your dad, your brother or some macho hunk on TV with a white foamy face just before shaving -- and trusty shaving cream is their answer for a smooth shave.  But beware the smell and that bulky can.  While the Aloe scent is tolerable, you can do better girl!<P>
<strong>SHAVING GEL</strong> Now, here's where it's at!  The name <em>gel</em> says it all.  It goes on easily, out of the fem, slender can and it smells divine!  Skintemate is its name -- and a smooth shave is its super-crucial claim!  And smooth it is.  Check it out and don't shave again with out it!</blockquote><P>

<BR><BR>Joke du Jour!<BR><BR><BR></CENTER>

<P>Three guys were fishing in the ocean when, suddenly, one of them hooked a mermaid and pulled her into the boat. She begged and pleaded for them to let her go -- and, in exchange, she would grant each of them a wish.</P>

<P>When the first guy asked:  "How do we know you can really grant wishes?"
The mermaid said, "Just make any wish and I'll prove it to you."</P>
<P>The first guy said, "Okay!  I want you to double my IQ!"</P>
<P>With a nod of the mermaid's head, he began to prefectly and eloquently recite endless lines of Shakespeare's poetry and analyze each line with extreme insight.</P>
<P>In amazement, the second guy immediately said, "I want you to triple my IQ!"</P>
The mermaid waved her hand and the second guy began to spout all the mathematical solutions to problems that have been stumping scientists of physics for years.</P>
<P>Seeing all of this, the third guy said, "I want you to quintuple my IQ!"</P>
But the mermaid said, "Look, I don't normally try to dissuade anyone from their wishes, but I really think you should reconsider that one."</P>
<P>"No, I definitely want you to quintuple my IQ!" insisted the third guy.</P>
"But it will change your entire view of the universe, it will force you to see things in an entirely different way!  Won't you ask for something else?  A million dollars, anything!?!" pleaded the mermaid.</P>
<P> But no matter what the mermaid said, the guy insisted on having his I.Q. increased by five times its usual power. </P>
<P>So the mermaid sighed and said "Done."</P>
<P>And he became a woman.</P></FONT>

What's The Deal With <B>Reality</B> --<BR> The Female Condom?<BR><BR>Even more info ....<BR><BR></CENTER>
<P><BR><BR>
<b>How Does It Work?</b></FONT><BR>
Reality is a soft, lubricated plastic sheath that lines the vagina.  It fits like a second skin, adhering to the vaginal wall, and also protects the outside of the vagina.  It has a soft, flexible ring at each end.  The ring inside the closed end helps you to put the female condoms inside the vagina, and helps hold it in place.  The other ring, which forms the open end of the sheath, stays outside the vagina, and partly covers the lop area.</P>
<P>For the best effectiveness, use a Reality condom with every sex act, and use a new one every time you have sex.  Like all condoms (and seat belts, too) they only work when you use them!  It's also a good idea to use additional lubricant at first.  Put a few drops in the opening of the condom and on the penis.  The additional lubricant diminishes friction and will stop any noises you may hear.  If you wish, you can use spermicide with it too, by putting it inside the vagina before you insert the Reality female condom.</P>
<P>It really helps if you practice inserting Reality before you plan to use it with your partner during sex.  This way, you'll better understand how it works and what feels most comfortable for you before you actually need it!</P>

<b>How Does It Protect Me?</b></FONT><BR>
The only 100% effective protection comes from abstinence.  No barrier method is 100% effective.  However, if Reality is used properly with every act of intercourse, it will provide protection against unintended pregnancy and will reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases.  The "typical" use failure rate using Reality in one six month study measuring contraception was 12%.  These women used Reality only sometimes or used it incorrectly.  When Reality was used properly every time, the failure rate was 3%.  Estimates of yearly failure rates are 19-25% for typical use and 5% for perfect use.</P>

1.  I like to wear tight stockings -- with a built-in support panty.  What are the <a href="hose1.html">pros and cons?</a><BR><BR></P>

Category 1<BR>Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia<BR>General Warning Signs<BR><BR><BR>
<P>If you can answer "yes" to two or more of the statements in Category 1, it certainly doesn't mean you have anorexia or bulimia -- but it might mean that you have an unhealthy or unrealistic view of yourself -- which is a classic symptom of women who do suffer from anorexia and bulimia. </FONT></CENTER></P>
<P>
A lot of young women go through times when they feel physically unattractive -- and even feel a little "out of control." But so much of these feelings are brought on as a result of unrealistic expectations we put on ourselves  -- like a need to be skinnier even when everyone else around us tells us that we're already thin enough!  </P>
<P>
For lots of young women and girls, it seems like weight is the only thing we can control in order to feel better about ourselves.  So many young women strive for perfection in everything -- and losing weight is just one way of feeling like we're doing this. </P>
<P>
Even though it's easier said than done ... it's extremely important to try and identify ourselves with things other than our weight.  For instance, ask yourself what you consider to be the best things about you ... </P>
<P>If your answer is something like "my hair, my legs, my chest" ... your focus may be too much on your physical self.  Just think about all the fantastic things about you that aren't purely physical -- the fact that you aced that math exam, the fact that you are an excellent soccer player or the fact that you have a great singing voice ... the list goes on and on! </P>
<P>When it comes right down to it -- your talents are the coolest, most interesting things about you! </P>

Category 2<BR>Anorexia Nervosa<BR>Specific Warning Signs<BR><BR><BR>
<P>A "yes" to two or more of the statements in Category 2 means that you definitely should take a closer look at your health -- and preferably with a health care provider who can determine if these signs are cause for concern. </P></FONT></CENTER>
<P>Without question, these are classic symptoms of a person suffering from anorexia nervosa.  This eating disorder is one in which a person attempts to lose weight by decreasing the amount of food she eats -- and some quit eating altogether. </P>
<P>But when your body doesn't get the necessary nutrients it needs, it begins to shut down.  One of the main things affected is your menstrual cycle.  When your total body fat percentage falls below a certain level, your body is unable to produce the hormones that control having a period.</P>
<P>
Though it may sound great to stop having your period, it's really very dangerous when it happens as a result of not taking in enough calories.  Your body needs a certain level of calories everyday.  For a young woman, this may mean 1000 to 2000 calories each and every day to give your body the energy it needs.  When your body is deprived of this, you can feel tired, dizzy or worse!</P>

If you can answer "yes" to two or more of the specific physical signs in Category 3 -- particularly if you also answered "yes" to statements in Category 2 -- you should see a health care provider to discuss your health.</FONT></CENTER></P>
<P>Category 3 lists symptoms of exactly what begins to happen to your body when it's not getting enough of the nutrients it needs.  Your skin, nails and hair are easily affected by a poor diet.  When you attempt an extreme diet or stop eating all together, you run the risk of truly hurting your body -- rather than helping it. </P>

Category 4<BR>Bulimia<BR>Specific Warning Signs<BR><BR><BR>
<P>Two or more answers of "yes" to the statements in Category 4 point toward some classic symptoms of bulimia -- and probably should be discussed with a health care provider.</FONT></CENTER></P>
<P>Bulimia is an eating disorder characterized by many of the symptoms in Category 4 -- forcing yourself to throw up, extreme dieting on some days and gorging on others, excessive use of laxatives, feeling out of control around food.  These symptoms in combination -- and particularly that of binging and purging (throwing up) -- are specific warning signs of bulimia.  </P>
<P>Just as with anorexia nervosa, the health consequences of bulimia are severe -- and lots of young women suffer from it. But there are ways to fight this eating disorder -- and you can start by talking with your health care provider. </P>

Category 5<BR>Bulimia<BR>Specific Alert Signs<BR><BR><BR>
<P>Answering "yes" to statements in Category  5 -- particularly if you can also answer "yes" to statements in Category 4 -- should be a red alert to you to talk with your health care provider.</FONT></CENTER></P>
<P>The symptoms in Category 5 are specific physical things that begin to happen to women who suffer from bulimia. A classic sign is that of cavities.  Throwing up results in the acidic fluids from your stomach passing over your teeth.  When you throw up excessively, this fluid eventually erodes the enamel on your teeth and makes you more likely to get cavities.  Other signs of excessive vomiting are a sore throat and hoarseness.</P>
<P>Finally, throwing up and excessive use of laxatives can leave your body dehydrated.  Dehydration can also lead to constipation -- therefore, it's easy for a person suffering from bulimia to get into a vicious cycle.</P>
<P>Bulimia is a very serious eating disorder that can severely impact your health.  If you think you have some of these classic symptoms and behaviors, see your health care provider for help!</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><BR>Question:  I like to wear tight stockings -- with a built-in support panty.  What are the pros and cons?<BR><BR></P>
<BR><BR>
<P><B>The benefits of wearing sturdy, tight stockings has been a secret <BR>of waitresses for a long time ... </FONT></P></CENTER></B>
<P>Lots of women who work in jobs that force them to stand on their feet for most of the day wear support-type stockings.  The benefit lies in the fact that the even pressure from the hose helps with the blood circulation in the legs.  Not only does is help by decreasing achey leg pain at the end of the day -- it also helps decrease the likelihood of getting varicose veins.</P>
<P>
<UL>(Varicose Veins -  ("vair-ah-kose") a condition in which poor circulation in the veins cause the vein to expand and protrude.  This condition can be genetic; however, special circumstances like excess pressure in the legs can force the condition to occur.)<BR></UL></P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><CENTER>
<P><B>Many young women find out the hard way <BR>what the problems are with wearing too tight stockings ...</FONT></P></B></CENTER>
<P>When stockings are too tight -- there is a good chance that your groin and pubic areas are not getting enough air.  This can result in the perfect environment for the micro-organisms that cause yeast infections to multiply!  Lots of young women who suffer from frequent yeast infections find that wearing looser pantyhose and wearing pantyhose less often can help decrease the number of yeast infection episodes they experience.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><BR>Question:  I prefer plain nylon hose without the extra panty.  Are there any positives and negatives to this?<BR><BR></P>
<BR><BR>
<P><B>You'd think that if there are problems with wearing <BR>too-tight stockings -- then wearing plain, nylon hose <BR>should be okay, right? Well, maybe ...</B></FONT></CENTER></P>
<P>The good thing about wearing loose, plain hose is simply to combat the problems with getting little air circulation around the pubic area.  When this area get plenty of air, there is less chance that the micro-organisms that cause yeast infections can thrive.  Wearing loose, plain hose may help with this battle if you are already susceptible to getting these infections.</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P><CENTER><B>Then again, maybe not ...</B></CENTER></FONT></P>
<P>The problem with wearing plain nylon stockings is that many of them come without the cotton crotch panel area built into the panty.  These panels are excellent because cotton helps keep the pubic area dry -- and provides great protection against yeast infections.  So, loose, plain hose are fine -- but the one's with a cotton panel are the best.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><BR>Question:  I like the hose with reinforced heels and toes.  Are there any benefits or problems with these?<BR><BR></P>
<BR><BR>
<P><B>The benefits are obvious...</B></FONT></CENTER></P>
<P>Although we haven't done an "official" study on this one, it's a pretty safe bet that the majority of runs in hose happen around the toes and heels.  Afterall, this is where the most friction happens.  So the best "health" benefit of reinforced toes might actually be for your wallet!  There is also some additional benefits to this due to the fact that the reinforced areas decrease any friction between your skin and your shoes -- protecting your heels and toes from blisters!
</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P><CENTER><B>The problems are not so obvious ...</B></CENTER></FONT></P>
<P>Because hose with reinforced heels and toes decrease friction between your skin and your shoes, you might not realize that your shoes don't fit properly.  Studies have shown that lots of women routinely buy shoes that are too small for them -- and the results can be painful!  Therefore, when shopping for shoes, don't be misled by wearing pantyhose that might make the shoes just "seem" to fit.  Also, make sure that your hose with reinforced heels and toes allow enough circulation -- both for blood and for air!  Too tight hose on your feet can play a role in achey, tired feet -- and can provide the perfect hot, moist environment for fungi to make a new home!

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Stormfront was the first White Nationalist site on the Web, going online
in March 1995. It was followed shortly by Reuben Logsdon's &quot;Cyberhate.&quot;
This precipitated an organized hate campaign by the Simon Wiesenthal Center
and similar groups to pressure our providers into yanking our accounts.
Since then, despite the best efforts of Rabbi Cooper and Company to censor
&quot;objectionable&quot; ideas, dozens of new sites have appeared. It's
becoming difficult for me to keep up with all of them, but I'll try to
keep this list updated with the most substantial of the new entries, along
with any URL changes for the old ones. </P>

<P>Please don't ask me to link sites at BHI's <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com">Geocities</A>.
This company offers free web pages, but it's adopted a policy of censoring
pro-White pages as soon as it finds them. Listing them here would only
hasten that process. <A HREF="http://www.aol.com">America Online</A> also
falls into this category.</P>

<DD>Pat Buchanan is a traditional populist conservative whose views frequently
coincide with those of White Nationalists. He was outspokenly opposed to
affirmative action and other anti-White programs long before it was fashionable
to do so. He called Capitol Hill &quot;Israeli-occupied territory.&quot;
He unflinchingly defended John Demjanjuk, the retired Cleveland auto worker
extradited to Israel for &quot;Nazi war crimes,&quot; and he was later
vindicated when the Israeli Supreme Court was forced to release Demjanjuk
in the face of new evidence released after the fall of the USSR. Though
he apparently does not understand the central importance of Race, his campaign
attracted some good people. This site, formerly the Buchanan for President
page, is now run by Linda Muller as a private project.</DD>

<DD>With many or most messages now crossposted to both the above newsgroups,
these have become very similar in content. The decibel level on the first,
nevertheless, is still slightly lower. Alt.politics.white-power seems to
be somewhat better known, however, having been mentioned in several national
news media recently.</DD>

<P><B>When the veil of fiction was rent, man shuddered before &quot;Nature,
red in tooth and claw.&quot; Nature had always been that and always will
be, and the hands of man, even when he fashions and defends the noblest
civilization, must forever be bloody hands, for this is a world in which
only the strong and resolute nations survive, while the weak, especially
the morally weak, who babble about brotherhood and peace, are biologically
degenerate and doomed to extinction.</B></P>

The group says the MarylandMotor Vehicle Administration's (MVA) recall violates their right to freespeech.  The recall was announced on January 2nd after the MVA said itreceived numerous complaints that the plates were offensive to blacks.  TheSons of Confederate Veterans are asking for an injunction stopping therecall and $1,000 in damages for each plate that is recalled.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>Tight Security at Burmeister Trial</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>The murder trial against former Fort Bragg soldier James Burmeister beganyesterday (1/21/97) under tight security.  Burmeister is accused ofshooting a black couple to death in December 1995.  Police said the murderswere racially motivated and it was reported that Burmeister is a skinhead.The state is seeking the death penalty in the case.  The judge ordered thateveryone must present identification every time they enter the courthouse.He also prohibited purses, briefcases, backpacks, bags and containers ofany kind.  Cell phones and pagers were also banned from the courthouse.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>3 Arrested at Georgia Anti-King March</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>Three people were arrested at a protest march in a mainly white county inGeorgia yesterday (1/20/97).  About 15 protesters waving Confederate andAmerican flags marched to the Forsyth county courthouse for a three-hourrally.  A spokesman for the sheriff's office said a member of theNationalist Movement was charged with simple assault and twocounter-demonstrators were charged with disorderly conduct.  The marchcelebrated the 10th anniversary of a Martin Luther King march by about 75people which drew over 2,500 counter-demonstrators and ended in rock andbottle throwing.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>Hess' Son Speaks on German TV</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>On Sunday (1/5/97) Wolf Ruediger Hess said on German television that his father, Rudolf Hess, was "absolutely innocent" and said he was killed by the English because he had proof that Britain wanted to continue World War II.  The program was broadcast on WDR, a privately-owned channel.  Also during the program Hess spoke of Hitler's government, saying "Seven million unemployed, empty public coffers, and after four years, everything was resolved.  [The government] in Bonn would be well inspired if they had someone with Hitler's ideas."  A spokeswoman for WDR said they were making no apologies for the broadcast because the chairman of the discussion reacted immediately in condemning Hess' views.  She also said about 30 to 40 complaints were received after the broadcast.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>MD Special License Plate Angers Blacks</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>Black leaders in Maryland are angered that the Confederate flag will be appearing on special license plates.  Maryland's Motor Vehicle Administration authorized the plates for members of the nonprofit group Sons of the Confederate Veterans (SCV).  Leroy W. Warren Jr. of the NAACP said "The state should not be selling those kinds of license plates.  There is no justifiable reason to remind people of the darkest days in this country's history."  Maryland State Senator Larry Young, who is also chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus, said "I'm taken aback.  I thought our climate was becoming progressive, but this situation shows obviously not."  A SCV member who requested the plate said "We did not choose to enter this program to evoke a controversy or fly a symbol into anybody's face.  It's a demonstration of pride just like any other institution would want to instill pride in their membership."  The Motor Vehicle Administration said officials did not find the design objectionable when they reviewed the application two years ago.  They also said they will now take another look.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><center><IMG WIDTH=468 HEIGHT=14 BORDER=0 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="images/barred.gif"></center><br><CENTER><IMG WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=305 BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="images/bornwhit.gif"></CENTER><hr><hr><A HREF="defaultf.htm"><IMG WIDTH=35 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="images/wplogos.gif">Return to main page</A> | <a href="current2.htm">Previous News Items</a> | <a href="mailto:dblack@jbx.com">E-mail Stormfront</a> | <a href="lform.htm">Post to the letters page</a></body></html>

The plan calls for an increase in the minority work force at Texaco from 23 percent to 29 percent within the next four years.  The proportion of negro employees is also planned to rise from 9 percent to 13 percent during the same time.  Texaco also wants the percentage of negroes among management to climb from 4 percent to 6.6 percent.  Managers will also be rewarded for hiring and promoting women and minorities.  Texaco also plans to spend almost $200 million per year on contracts with minority-owned companies.  The company will also try to arrange with financial institutions to help negroes secure loans to buy, lease and franchise Texaco outlets and will try to expand minority management of its $1.4 billion pension fund.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>Three Teens Arrested For Smashing Menorah</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>Three Pennsylvania teenagers were arrested yesterday (12/13/96) for smashing a Jewish family's menorah.  Police said the teens shattered the Markovitz's front window last Sunday with baseball bats and then threw the electric menorah on the ground.  District Attorney Alan RUBENSTEIN said the three "didn't seem to be part of an organized group, like Aryan Nation."  The teens were charged with ethnic intimidation, vandalism and several lesser charges.  One was released on $100,000 bail, and the others were released to their parents because they are juveniles.<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>Spanish Bookstore Raided</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>Yesterday (12/12/96) Spanish police raided a book store in Barcelona, Spain, and seized over 7,000 books and other material they say "espoused Nazism" and denied the "Holocaust."  The owner of the store, Pedro Varela, was arrested and later released on bail.  Police said most of the books, which were written in Spanish, German and English, were published in South America.  Swastika flags and "xenophobic videos" were also seized.  A law has recently been passed in Spain which makes in illegal to "defend genocide."<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>Prison Guard Investigated For Flying Swastika</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>Edward Kuhnel, a New York state prison guard, is being investigated for flying a swastika flag from his porch.  Kuhnel is a guard at the maximum-security Eastern Correctional Facility, which is about 70 miles north of New York City.  He said he has no intention of removing the flag.  He told the media on Monday (12/9/96) "I am not a racist and not a Nazi.  I like the color of the flag. I put the American flag out, too."  A spokesman for the State Department of Correctional Services said Kuhnel has violated a rule prohibiting guards from participating in activities that "discredit the prison department and display sympathy or support for racist views."  Kuhnel was suspended for several months in 1988 for displaying materials at the prison indicating that he belonged to the National Association for the Advancement of White People.  An attempt to fire him failed because there was not enough proof that it was a "racist group."  Yesterday New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Jew, called for Kuhnel's dismissal, asking if the state can "safely assume that a man who brazenly displayed a classic symbol of bigotry...will discharge his duties in a fair and equitable manner during working hours?"<p><em> Anton H., ANA Editor</em><hr width=85% align=center size=1 noshade><br><h3><em>Justice Department Tries to Strip US Citizenship From Man</em></h3><p> <b><a href="mailto:ana@stormfront.org">(ANA)</a></b>The US Justice Department is trying to strip the citizenship from a Florida man on the grounds that he "aided Nazi persecution of Jews in Lithuania during World War II."

<p>Learn your history or you will live some one elses! I was suprised to read a woman previous
my entry stating that she had a relative fighting for the South in the Civil War. She was proud of that, however she found Stormfront "wrong". I dare say if you asked your ancestor his belief it would differ from yours, my darling liberal!
<p>White woman your ignorance is our curse, every time you date outside your race, you destroy the blood of your family, your culture and pride. You lower yourself and disgrace your soul.
Please open a history book, it is your genes that are responsible for  higher culture.

<h3><i>Response to slavery messages...</i></h3>

<p><tt>Oct 17 19:47 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>After reading several posts concerning the slavery of Africans in the 
United States, I would like to make a couple of comments.

<p>My great-great-great grandfather had a plantation in the south during
the time of slavery.  He owned many slaves and had a very successful
operation.  When the United States government ended slavery, he 
allowed them to leave if they wanted.  But these slaves did not want
to leave.  Granted, he did not torture his slaves just as a rancher
would not torture his cattle.  He had an investment in the slaves and
harming them in any way would hurt his pocket.  You'll also find that 
many of the plantation owners worked alongside the blacks.    

<p>So, to the several blacks that have posted on the Stormfront Web 
site, I suggest this: African slaves did not abhor slavery as much
as is popularly portrayed.  They knew nothing else and when freed, 
many stayed right where they were at, working in the fields.  

<p>To suggest that I owe the African-American people anything because
of something my ancestors did is rediculous.  The African-Americans
in the United States who are complaining today were not even the 
ones who were allegedly oppressed.  

<p>Blacks in America should thank Whites for bringing them to the United
States.  The opportunities available for Blacks in the United States
today are tremendous and it is not "Whitey's" fault if Blacks do not
take advantage of them.  You must ask yourself one question:  Would
you rather be where you are at right now, in the United States, or 
would you rather be in Africa spearing animals and dying of huge
famines and droughts?  

<p>I am proud of my White heritage.  Every race is ethnocentric.  Blacks
have the right to be proud of their African heritage.  Just as Asians,
Latinos, and even Jews have.  But when non-White races label Whites
for ethnocentrism, it is a double-standard.  If a million White men
marched in Washington, it would be considered evil.  But when a 
million black men march in Washington, it is considered a good thing.
Racism is present in every race.  It is an innate part of human
existance.  

<p>After 120 years of no slavery in the United States, the usual complaint
by blacks that their statistical information is lower because of 
slavery is invalid.  Blacks are not born into a life of crime and are
not born into a life of welfare.  They choose this option.  The 
Arizona Republic printed the following statistics on Monday, October 16,
1995 as part of the Million Man March articles.  

<ul>
<dt>In 1994, nearly 30 percent of all black males in their 20s were
   either incarcerated or on probation or parole.

<dt>The homicide rate is 72 per 100,000 black men, compared with 14.2
   for black women, 9.3 for white men and 3 for white women.

<dt>Average unemployment for black men is 12 percent;  it is 11 percent
   for black women, 5.4 percent for white men and 5.2 percent for
   white women.
</ul>
<p>Why do people lock their doors when a group of young black men walk 
down the street?  This is the reason.  


<p>So, blacks hold in their hands the key to ending any discrimination
against them.  What do they need to do?  Stop committing (as many)
crimes, stop killing people, and get jobs.  The perceived discrimination
that blacks complain about will end when they take responsibility for
their own actions.  

<p>As for the topic of drug use and abuse and the attempt to shift the
blame to "Whitey" for bringing the drugs "from Columbia to America"
to poison the black culture, this is utterly rediculous.  Drug use
and abuse is a problem across all races, not just blacks.  However,
many blacks feel that they needn't try to get a job or succeed in
society.  What better way to make a living (and a profitable one at
that) than to sell drugs.  Blacks are the ones selling drugs to other
Blacks.  And when the drugs come from Columbia, blame the Latino and 
Mexican race, not Whites.  

<p>When blacks do not perceive me as a racist because I love my heritage,
my anger will stop.  I do not hate on the basis of skin color.  There
are far better reasons to hate someone than the color of their skin.  
Not allowing me to be proud of my European heritage is at the top of the
list.


<p>"We must secure the existance of our people, 
            and a future for White children."

<h3><i>The MILLION MAN MARCH</i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Oct 17 17:20 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>What a scary picture on the front page of today's newspaper.  Hundreds of thousand's of blacks led by Louis Farrakhan marching on the mall outside of the capital.  If White Americans had of tried to do that there would have been a riot caused by the blacks.  The message was for black men to take responsibility for their lives and those of their families.  Good message. Nothing wrong with that.  But look who the leader is.  Farrakhan!  

<p>Wake up black people!!! If you want equality and justice you do not select a leader who preaches hatred.  He is fooling you. He is preaching the Gospel now to get you to believe in him, but once he has you he will start telling you that white people are bad.  He is leading you to confrontation and you don't even know it.

<h3><i>Asians in Norway</i></h3>

<p><tt>Mon Oct 16 23:27 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>Dear Stormfront, I am a twenty-seven year old male in Northern 
Norway, married to a beautiful wife, Katia, and father of a 
beautiful daughter, Save.

<p>Please forgive my grammer. I have 
had very little contact with any "non-white" races, having
spent my life in Norway. But here in Velijord, our nearest neighbors
are Filipinos, or asians. I was a white supremacist when I was
younger boy, but I have changed that slightly. I do not know if
I support my previous views anylonger. Our neighbors are good 
people, and have helped us from time to time. I admit that I was
at first, bothered by them. Or perhaps, just fearful. But that 
turned out to be just a presumption that was unfounded. 

<p>I was
convinced to visit the United States, San Francisco to be exact,
to see if what television showed us was true. There were a great
number of Asians and whites in San Francisco, and I was surprised
to see such a mixture, but not surpised to see that they worked
so well together. In fact, one of my younger ideals when I was a 
skinhead was to somehow bring up a fourth reich with the Aryans 
of Europe, beginning in Germany, and to once again align 
this supremacist movement with the Japanese, who were ironically
better friends and allies to Adolf Hitler than the Italians were.
They reflected loyalty, honestly, and dogmatism, almost aryan in
their zeal. But anyway, in San Francisco, I was treated very well
by the Asians and especially my friends family. 

<p>Perhaps the only 
bad experience I had there was when we went a place called Oakland
and went to a mall. A group of black men approached us and asked
us to give them some money. My friend began to take out his
wallet when one of them suddenly struck him in the face. I was
suddenly angery and kicked the black man in the groin with my boots
(which I still retained from my skinhead days in Oslow). The others
came at me and my friend then, and we fought them off amazingly.
He apologized to me afterward for what had happened, and I 
could not understand why. They had attacked us, not the other
way around. We returned back to Norway, both of us a little
bruised from our encounter. I have realized that Asians are a
good people, and that I do not mind them as neighbors and friends.
But I am wondering now about how I would feel if black people
would move in to my country, and if they would show the same 
kindness. I was fearful of my daughter, Save, playing with my 
friend's daughter because I was still very prejudiced. But I have
found that my fears are not founded. They are now very good friends.
I still support white pride. I favor co-existence with Asians. But
I question whether or not blacks will be the same way. Please
understand that I am not a racist, but that I am trying to understand.

<p><tt>Mon Oct 16 19:07 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>This is to reply to all those who have sent me email concerning my "racist" attitude in the letter I have posted on this website. I am not a racist but I do believe in that we all come from different cultures and that if we  arn't careful we will lose the white culture. My only  purpose to protect that. If you don't like it then that is just too bad, as we are all allowed differences in thought..Although if you talk to any of the people who have been so kind to email me, my thoughts are invalid because they are the not what they believe .

<h3><i>Wake Up Call</i></h3>

<p><tt>Mon Oct 16 15:38 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I write this on the morning of the so-called "Million Man March" on Washington,
and would like to make a few points by relating some experiences on the way to work 
this morning.  First off, let me preface this by saying that I do not
"hate" other races, but I am proud to be Aryan.  

<p>I took public transportation to work this morning; a relatively short subway ride.  As the journey 
progressed, I noticed more and more blacks boarding the train bound for
the "Million Man March" site.  I felt a mob mentality take over, as is 
common where blacks congregate.  The black mob begin to shout, verbally abuse,
and generally harass the white commuters.  I heard such things as "It's time
to take over" and "You can't hide from this."

<p>As I took note of all this, I pondered a couple of things;

<p>1.  This march was better organized than any of us had figured.  The blacks
exhibited a solidarity that I have seldom seen whitebread America muster.

<p>2.  These people hate us, and they want blood.  

<p>My point is this; These people were clearly together and spoke with one 
voice.  I have yet to witness white-collar average joe American exhibit 
this sort of cohesiveness; we're all too busy taking care of our own
asses.  White America, it's time to wake up and smell the slime.  We've
given blacks every opportunity in the form of affirmative action, quotas,
welfare, public dole; you name it.  It's not opportunity they want, they
want control of the country.  They want to see all whites enslaved or
hanging from trees.  This "Million Man March" has done nothing but affirm
my belief that a race war is imminent.  What I am saying, White Folks, 
is you'd better be ready to fight, because the blacks sure as hell are.

<p>We as white Americans have gone soft; we've lost our values, lost our 
direction.  Our society is going the way of ancient Rome, permiated with
laziness, greed, lust, gluttony, etc.  We must come together before it
is too late, because very soon the time to defend ourselves from this
black onslaught will arrive.  We will have to stand and fight for our families
and our way of life; we must begin preparation now.  If we fail, we have
no one to blame but ourselves.

<h3><i>I Wonder</i></h3>

<p><tt>Mon Oct 16 12:22 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I mistakenly came across this page in my Internet travels.  I always wondered if such a place existed, kind of curious I guess.  But after discovering your little world of hate I find myself disgusted.  You people are cowards.  Afraid to face the world as it is and desperate to live this hassle free life where all your inadequacies can be blamed on the black man or the Jew.  I am a white male who has no complaints with any particular race.  Maybe you people should get on with living and give up your fantasies of a pure world.  How pure would it be with a bunch of blood thirsty hate mongers running loose?  Now I don't believe for one second that my heartfelt letter will have any effect on the dedicated subscribers of the Stormfront but I do feel that I have a right to judge and comment on your beliefs and lack of values.  Feel free to E-mail a letter back and tell me why I should hate the niggers and beat on some Jews.  Also I feel that the name Stormfront is really cute!
  and spooky.  I'm sure the Nigger-haters Club of the World would suffice too, but then again it wouldn't be approved of by the furherur.  I could sit here and give freaked out bible quotes and biological babble why were all equal but it would be a waster of time on your shrivelled black hearts.  Thank You for taking the time to read this.

<h3><i>It's time to rethink our motives</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sun Oct 15 17:33 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>My question to all the readers is where do I fit in?  I am a blond-haired, blue-eyed white
male.  I am exceptionally right-wing.  I believe in the following:

<p>1) Mixing of the races will eventually lead to the extinction of the caucasian race.

<p>2) Blacks are the primary cause of all crimes.

<p>3) Immigration is undermining America's foundation.

<p>4) An armed society is an honest society.

<p>I maintain a cache of weapons, ammunition, and I firmly believe that one day
I will need to use these in order to defend my family, property, and self.

<p>My family's lineage includes Confederate soldiers, Klan members, slave masters,
etc.  I am also a proud member of Sons of the Confederacy and Florida Pioneers.
The other half of my family (my mother's side) are Jewish immigrants from Russia.
I am Jewish.  I was Bar Mitzvah'd.  I am marrying a Jewish girl in less than three
weeks.  She feels the same way I do about most issues.

<p>My questions are as follows:

<p>1) There are a lot of white people in my position, ones who are "disqualified" from the white nationalist movement by a RELIGION, not a race. 

<p>2) Am I precluded from all "activities" because I am Jewish, as I will proudly admit, even though I would make most Stormfront readers look like tree-hugging homos.

<p>I want straight answers, no BS.  Where does everyone stand on this issue?
Unfortunately, I don't have time to write a well-thought out letter and I have a couple of coworkers
with wandering eyes. Please respond.

<h3><i>"Rights"</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Oct 13 12:34 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>While the Rodney King beating was wrong, Reno and the US Justice Dept
wasted no time in bringing "civil rights" charges against Powell and
Koon, and they are now in prison.  Where is the US Justice Dept's
civil rights suit against OJ???  No where, of course.  Seems like ole
Rodney has more "civil rights" than Simpson's now dead wife, Goldman,
and Vicki weaver, for that matter.

<p>The stench of hypocrisy that rises from the Rodhamite/Clintonista
Justice Dept is unbelievable.  Now, if the people of Los Angeles
reacted to the OJ verdict according to the Maxine Waters theory of
civic responsibility, whites would have rioted, and burned the place
to the ground.  This did not happen.  But watch,  whites will continue
to flee the cities, vote Republican, and have their duly elected
representatives end the welfare state that has ruined this country.
So, maybe the OJ verdict is good, after all.

<p>Thank you OJ for demonstrating that black juries cannot be
trusted to understand the evidence or render justice to
members of their own race.

<p>Thank you OJ for exposing the depth of racism among American

committed by American blacks.

<p>Thank you OJ for proving correct all of the racial stereotypes
about what happens when black men marry white women.

<p>Thank you OJ for turning American feminists into instant enemies
of their former allies on the affirmative action Left.

<p>Thank you OJ for causing so many American whites to abandon
the Democrat Party because of its pro-black racism.

<p>Thank you OJ for being a symbol of everything a man should not be.

<h3><i>Waco and Ruby Ridge</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Oct 13 04:58 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I wish to add a few viewpoints of my own to the above-listed debates. First off, I disagree with a lot of people concerning the "massacre" in Waco. I live not too far from there, and kept up with the entire episode. Though I do believe that the BATF and FBI really screwed up in their methods of storming the compound at Mount Carmel (yes, I agree that they were wrong in most aspects), the reason that the government agencies went there in the first place was to arrest David Koresh. The man was a terribly misguided lunatic who brainwashed his followers into believing that he was the son of God. Those of us in the social sciences call that a "cult." David Koresh broke the law by stockpiling illegal arms. The only way we can fight to keep our constitutional rights to bear arms is though the court system and by exercising our right to vote. If you don't like certain laws, do what you can to change them. Creation of fanatical fringe groups only hurts such causes.

<p>Like I said, I'm not denying that government agencies screwed up royally. However, when people mention about all the innocent lives of children lost in the fracas at Waco, we must consider that the children who died in that episode remained there by the orders of David Koresh. Young children do not have the learned experience of most adults to discern a true difference between right and wrong. They only can believe what is taught to them; when that teacher is a raving madman, and no one provides alternative views and information, they thereby are forced to believe in only one thing. In this case, it meant believing in dying for a cause. I see so many similarities between the incident at Waco and what happened many years earlier in Guyana. The so-called "Reverend" Jim Jones convinced many people to commit suicide there. David Koresh did the same thing at Waco. Some say that the fire at the compound in Waco was caused by the government, but I have viewed footage of the incident, even some that is unpublished, with great scrutiny. In my viewing of this footage, I was able to see that the fires *did* originate from within the building. Furthermore, there were people who were inside and who survived, that have made statements attesting to the same. Therefore, I can only come to the conclusion that what happened in Waco was not only our governments' latest mistake, but that the main cause of what happened was due to the misguidance of those under the "spell," so to speak, of David Koresh.

<p>Unlike the incident at Waco, my information concerning what happened at Ruby Ridge is quite limited. The only information I have is what I saw from the news media. I understand that the government went there to serve an arrest warrant to someone for (does this sound familiar?) stockpiling illegal armaments. *However*, I will agree with most others that the government added one more big screwup to their growing list. I simply cannot believe that someone "accidentally" shot the man's wife through the head. *Very* simple logic would tell anyone with an IQ higher than a simian that, if someone is a sharpshooter, they *should* be able to discern the difference between a suspected male and a female, even more so one holding an infant. If the man who fired that shot was able to line up the crosshairs on his scope well enough to shoot her through the head, he certainly should have been able to tell *who* he was shooting at. I feel that there are WAY too many gung-ho, trigger-happy people working for governmental agencies. Some of these guys need to sign up for mercenary work and go find a war some place. It's not like there is a shortage of wars these days. At least then they would be able to satiate their primordial desires to kill others, but this time shoot at people who can actually shoot back. Hell, they'd not only be doing themselves a favour, but they just might do *us* a favour by getting killed by the very people they are killing.

<p>It's no wonder there are so many people today who are dissatisfied with our government. And though I still feel the main way to remedy this is through our collective powers at the polls, we do have to keep in mind that we are up against others with the right to vote who still believe that everything our government does is for the good of everyone. *They* are the ones we need to educate; unfortunately, most of them are too pompous to even listen, thinking that they are so superior because they have lots of money and went to Harvard or wherever. They just don't seem to realize that a degree from an Ivy League institution does not necessarily make one intelligent or enlightened. So what else can we do? Join a militia group? Not me, folks; some of those groups scare me even more than my own government does. Too many of them are filled with hate mongers who want nothing less than to perpetuate the same sort of crimes that Hitler and his followers did. I do not wish to blindly fol!
 low those in power in this country, nor do I wish to align myself with a group of people who, sooner or later, will think of a reason to disclude me from their little clique. All I want is for our goverment to be responsible and representative of the majority of the people, not just cowtow to those who can pad their pockets.

<p>Any suggestions?

<h3><i>Race & American Psyche</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Oct 13 00:28 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>It is very interesting how many "Americans" quickly yell obscene names
at other racial groups, yet when you boil it down they don't actually
have a source of hate besides "Mr/Ms So-and-so says that they ....".

<p>The key to effective political objective achievement is to know your enemy
and therefore knowing his / her weaknesses.  I often refer to Sun Tsu's
"Art of War".  That book really helps you get in focus how you can
aim your political weapon, and therefore come off as an individual and
/ or group that is not just "A screaming crowd of yahoos."

<p>Remember my young ones, the mad dog is the first shot, but the 
sly dog is the last suspected.

<p>Quit with the rhetoric.  In all of the letters written herin, 
few make any sense to me.  All I can read is hate and fear.  Say some-
thing for real and speak with intelligence instead of inciting fires
with sparks of ignorance.  We need peace in this time...for our
precious children's sake...and for ours.

<h3><i>Space & Race</i></h3>

<p><tt>Wed Oct 11 19:27 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>aa107547@midnet.csd.scarolina.edu made some good points in a recent 
letter.  In particular, I strongly agree with your statements about the need for "life" to expand into
the nearly limitless resources of outer space.  And, of course, as you
pointed out, space exploration has been a very "white" project.

<p>With regard to miscegenation, I notice that very few people have spoken
about the struggle among different genes to replicate themselves in
competition with other genes.  Once this genetic competition -- the
so-called "selfish gene" theory -- is recognized, then the logical next
step is to compare the ability of race-specific genes to compete.  Here
the answer is clear to anyone who has taken high school biology:
The genes of the white race are recessive, while the genes of non-whites
are dominant.  So when whites and non-whites cross-breed, the non-white
genes will (statistically) predominate nearly always (with very few
exceptions).  Therefore, it is perfectly natural for white genes, and
hence the white race, to preserve itself by avoiding race mixing.
Our very genes demand such a strategy, else we will disappear as a
race.  And that would be the greatest tragedy of all.

<h3><i>Separatism, not racism!!</i></h3>

<p><tt>Mon Oct  9 02:01 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I think there is a common misconception. I have seen the tv talk shows and read the articles, and when there are other groups who are singing the praises of unity it is great, e.g. The Nation of Islam. However, when a white man steps up and says "we have to unite and keep ourselves together" he gets crucified and branded a racist. 

<p>I will be honest, I am not a racist, but I hate this whole idea of being squashed into one super-culture with everyone else. I am not african-american or latin-american. I am white, if anything I am a European-American. I think it is good to see a few white people standing up for themselves. I am tired of being called a racist because I am proud to be white. I think it is truly time to stand up and be counted, and recognized as what I am... a White American Male and damned proud of it! I want my children to grow up to marry whites. I want to keep my family lineage white, is that so wrong? Do I have to put up with all this "the white man is holding me down" crap? 

<p>Anyhow, I just wanted to say, to all of you here with the guts to speak your mind, good job. I don't like the ignorant racist rhetoric, but I do like to see people, white people, stand up for what they believe in!!

<h2>My Indian Odyssey</h2>
<h1>A Ghost from India Haunts Me Still</h1>
<h3>by David Duke</h3>

<p>
<i><strong>My Indian Odyssey</strong> is an excerpt from David Duke's forthcoming
autobiography. These passages were written about his journey to
India in 1971. At that time he was returning from Vientianne,
Laos, where he had instructed anti-Communist Laotian Army and
Air Force officers near the end of the Vietnam War. Representative Duke can be reached
at PO Box 88, Covington, LA 70434, or through his <a href="http://www.duke.org">Web page</a>. </i>
<hr size=4>
<br>
<p>

<font size=+4>W</font>ho can forget the day on which he first
sees one of the Seven Wonders of the World? I vividly remember
the details of the August day when I first saw the Taj Mahal.

<p>
Armed with a camera and a frayed note-pad,
I trotted out of the YMCA at about 5:30 in the morning. The cool
air felt good as I walked briskly toward the center of New Delhi.
Thousands of chirping birds serenaded me as I walked along the
main boulevards. A fat, bushy-tailed squirrel dared to cross my
path a few inches from my shoes, having learned no fear of man.
Such an abundance of small birds and animals was quite a contrast
from what I had seen in Laos and Thailand. Indo-Chinese cities
have a scarcity of small game because overpopulation has encouraged
the people to eat almost anything that moves which is not poisonous.
In India, however, small game is protected by religious sanction
-- and religious taboos in India seem even more powerful than
hunger. 
<p>
Small animals were not the only creatures
in great abundance in India, for so were the people. Along one
long sidewalk I saw hundreds of wooden shelves, each about the
size of a refrigerator laying on its side. Each served as home
for one or more people. Even less fortunate souls lay on the grass
or in the brown dust with a tattered blanket serving as their
only shelter. Some had only rags to protect themselves from the
elements. About a block from the YMCA, an old man grunted as he
squatted and defecated in the gutter; a little further on, a bony
couple engaged in pleasureless sexual intercourse while two children
sat beside them and played in the dust. Millions in India live
out their lives on the public streets awash in dust and mud. There
they are born; and there they bathe, eat, sleep, excrete, and
copulate. As attested by the teeming population, breeding is their
most successful endeavor.
<p>
As I penetrated deeper into the center
of New Delhi, I found that there were, however, many modern structures.
Most of them housed branches of European firms doing business
in India. Many Indian Government buildings had been constructed
in the colonial style of the twenties and thirties under the auspices
of English imperial rule. The contrast between abject human debasement
only a few steps away from monumental achievements was disconcerting;
but my eyes slowly got used to the stark disparity as I headed
for one of the main, commercial squares.
<p>
About 8:30 I reached the square where
I planned to inquire about bus service to Agra, site of the famed
Taj Mahal. The streets were buzzing with activity. The grass on
the boulevard's center ground was being mowed by a cylindrical
lawnmower pulled by a large white bull. It was guided by a turbaned
Indian dressed in white of a similar shade to the animal's. Near
some tour buses, I learned that I could ride to Agra and back
in a taxi cab (a round trip of over two hundred miles) for only
twelve dollars. I met a young Cambridge student of English derivation
traveling during his summer vacation, and we decided to share
a cab after getting some breakfast at the main coffee house on
the square.
<p>
Six Indians behind the counter worked
at a furious pace, serving hundreds of patrons. Each worker had
a separate job. Only one washed dishes, and cleanliness was not
one of his finer points, for he looked as though he moonlighted
as a grave-digger. Crusty black dirt trimmed the tips of his fingernails;
the lighter spots on his face and neck ,on diffident inspection,
turned out to be streaks where sweat and drool had washed off
some layers of muck. After hundreds of washings from the same
filthy water, his dish rag could only be adequately compared to
mummy wrappings. Plates and utensils were wiped according to immediate
necessity right before the eyes of the customer.
<p>
It was easy to convince myself that
I really wasn't hungry, but Rodney Johnson, my new English friend,
wolfed down coffee and fried eggs without the slightest suggestion
of discomfort. In fact, it perturbed me that he seemed to actually
enjoy it. Perhaps he simply wanted to keep up the British image
of true colonial grit. 
<p>
We hired a run down taxi of a make I
couldn't identify. Some sort of strange religious symbols hung
from the rearview mirror, and the clear plastic seats immediately
stuck to our bare legs as the three hour trip to Agra began. A
dozen books I had read on India didn't prepare me as I gazed at
the worsening panorama of horrors unfolding as we sped from the
business district of New Delhi. There were hundreds of rickety,
bug-eyed children, and I even saw two emaciated corpses lying
on the street, treated like so much refuse to be hauled away.
Incoherent squabbling and bargaining of the marketplace pounded
on my auditory nerves, and strange stenches filled my nostrils
from time to time. Sometimes the odors came from the fires made
from briquettes of bovine and human dung used as fuel. Amid the
ruins and rubble lay intermittent piles of ancient garbage being
picked over by the starving, looking for even the tiniest of rotting
morsels.
<p>
Once in a while an old temple or structure
would heave into view out of this sea of desolation and offer
a brief glimpse into a high culture that had been. The mind of
this young Westerner visiting India for the first time was not
going to be ensnared by the ugliness and the decay, for gradually,
in the midst of the ruins and putrefaction, I resurrected in my
imagination the once beautiful, magnificent empire of India. I
could feel the vitality and creativity that had ruled this land
thousands of years before; I could see the farmers and tradesmen,
the artisans and musicians, the road builders and architects.
<p>
As the cab began to wind out of the
stifling, heat-magnifying city and emerged into the countryside,
I thought about the once great Indian civilization. Green rice
fields sped by the window of my cab as I weighed what I had learned
from books and from the conversations I had with Indian college
professors over the previous few days. The historical facts that
swirled in my mind mingled with indelible impressions I harvested
with my own eyes.
<p>
Aryans, or Indo-European Caucasians
created the great Indian, or Hindu Civilization. Aryans swept
over the Himalayas to the Indian sub-continent and conquered the
aboriginal people. The original term &quot;India&quot; was coined
by the Aryan invaders from their Sanskrit word Sindu for the river
now called the Indus. Sanskrit is perhaps the oldest of the Indo-European
languages, having a common origin to all the modern languages
of Europe. Composed in about 1500 BC, the Hindu religious texts
of the Rig Veta tell the story of the long struggle between the
Aryans and the aboriginal people of the Indian subcontinent. Sixteen
Aryan states were partitioned by the sixth century AD, and Brahmanism
became the chief religion of the India. After the conquest, the
conquering race initiated a caste system to preserve their status
and their racial identity. The Hindu word for caste is &quot;Varna,&quot;
which means color. Today the word is usually associated with occupation
or trade; but the occupations evolved originally on the basis
of ethnicity. The palest of skin were called the Brahmin, the
warrior-priest class, the top of the social ladder. Untouchables,
or Pariahs, the racially mixed, or &quot;raceless ones,&quot;
were at the bottom.
<p>
Over the past few centuries, the clear
racial differences faded, but one can still notice the lighter
hues and taller statures of the higher castes. Many scholars consider
Sanskrit the oldest and purest of the Indo-European languages.
In modern India, the greatest insult one could pay a fellow Indian
is to call him &quot;black.&quot;
<p>
In spite of all the organized government
and media efforts to root out racial feeling, there is still ample
evidence that race does matter in modern India. Rodney told me
that the &quot;personal ad&quot; columns catering to the English-speaking
Indians are interesting in that the skin color of the advertiser
is always described very precisely. Before I left India, I found
that the ads often had an emphasis on the degree of lightness
of the perspective husband or wife.
<p>
The average Christian conservative of
the Western world would be aghast at the exuberant interest displayed
by the ancient Indians in sex and the ways they publicly displayed
sexual experiences through art. Hindu history, though, seems to
indicate that it was not any preoccupation with sex that brought
down the high culture, as much as the racial impact of that obsession.
In spite of strict religious and civil taboos, the ancient Aryans
crossed the color line. Slavery, or a similar system, makes servant
women easily obtainable and has proven a dangerous temptation
for some of the basest of the slave holders. Only a small percentage
of each generation had sexual liaisons with the lower castes,
but over dozens of generations a gradual change in the racial
composition had occurred, almost imperceptible in a single generation,
but dramatic after a millennium.
<p>
Perhaps one of the problems of the Indian
civilization, I reflected, (and of every one since) is that the
most creative, most intelligent and most-successful people have
had many distractions from sex and family, while the lower classes
find sex a much more important form of recreation and fulfillment,
in fact it is the one highly enjoyable pastime the poor can always
afford. Every civilization has a lower average birthrate among
its most talented elements while its less intelligent and unproductive
tend to proliferate, India was no exception.
<p>
Traveling 45 m.p.h. with all the taxi's
windows down, it was still so hot and dusty that my British friend
and I felt as though we could not get enough air. However, India
was not the dry, desert-like expanse that I had pictured. Certainly
there are arid areas in India, but great portions of the country
are humid and wet. During my stay I saw beautiful sea ports, green
fertile valleys, thick forests and jungles, mountains that glittered
with the reflection of their vast mineral wealth. The road we
traveled on was far from dry. Rice field followed rice field,
and there were numerous waterholes -- usually beset by cows cooling
their sacred hides. 
<p>
At mid-morning we decided to stop for
a little refreshment, and the cab driver pulled off the highway
by a little shanty cafe'. By that time my hunger had overcome
my lack of enthusiasm for Indian dish washing. My English friend,
undaunted as ever, ordered some fried eggs. I optimistically thought
that eggs fried in a hot skillet, albeit dirty, wouldn't do much
harm, so I put my order in. Since the coffee was boiling hot,
I consented to have some of it, as well.
<p>
After letting them cool a bit, I ravenously
consumed a nice yellow spoonful of eggs. A feeling like liquid
fire spread from my tongue to the roof of my mouth, and clear
back to my larynx. It spread from my throat into my esophagus
and stomach. My eyes watered. My nose ran. I tried to swallow,
but I couldn't. I looked at the swarthy, beady-eyed driver, then
at the proprietor of the shanty and imagined a criminal conspiracy
between them. I imagined the authorities finding my poisoned,
pain-contorted body in a rice paddy a few days later, stripped
of identification, passport, camera and money.
<p>
Then, through a blurry film, could see
Rodney wolfing down his eggs like they were milk chocolate. Maybe
what I had taken for British bravado was only true affection for
this land and its traits.
<p>
I believed that I stumbled onto the
reason why almost all the food in India is intolerably hot; for
as famished as I was, that one bite was more than enough for me
that morning. Suddenly, I wasn't hungry any more, but no longer
from fear of dirty utensils, for I figured that few germs could
have survived the heat of the little red infernos the Indians
call peppers. Growing up in south Louisiana, I had always been
exposed to very spicy food, but those Indian peppers could have
passed for glowing embers of lava! Only the English could have
colonized this place, for only they, like Rodney, had the stomach
for it. 
<p>
Near the shanty were hordes of small
children. A number of them had deformities such as full or partial
blindness and amputated limbs. The cab driver told me that many
are purposely mutilated by their own parents to increase their
intake from begging. As he spoke I grew angry and bitter at such
cruelty and corruption.
<p>
As we drove on, I found the poverty
of New Delhi duplicated in the countryside. We passed many settlements
teeming with rag-swathed, skeleton people--a sight that no Westerner
can view without compassion. There are children starving everywhere.
Cruel, open sores adorned their bodies; and unrelenting flies
swarmed to make a meal of the abundant rotting flesh. 
<p>
The probable first impulse of any American
who learns of India's plight is to send money and food; but by
sending such assistance he is really only compounding the agony.
The reason that so many are starving is the chronically high birth
rate. The resulting overpopulation outstrips the ability of the
people to feed themselves. Unless the givers tie aid to absolute
guarantees of population control, the increased food simply feeds
another reproducing generation that in turn only multiples the
problem! Despite this self-evident fact, Western nations have
poured unending food and medical supplies into India. The purpose
of the relief at its start early in this century was to help the
thousands who were starving. Paradoxically, because of our generosity
we can now proudly report that hundreds-of-millions starve in
India! The sunken faces of the malnourished, sick and mutilated
children around the nation are the results of misplaced humanitarianism
that has only increased human suffering and death.
<p>
At our next stop on this trip to the
Taj Mahal, my attention was diverted from the suffering of the
Indian people, to an innocent victim of those people. We had stopped
at a small bazaar along the road. Present were fakirs, snake charmers,
and animal trainers. One turban-crowned Indian had what he called
a &quot;dancing bear.&quot; A worn, leather leash was tightened
around the bear's neck, causing him to choke and gag. It was stifling
hot and this poor creature sweated profusely, soaking his heavy
coat and contributing to the severe skin infections that scarred
his body and had removed large patches of fur.
<p>
This bear was so emaciated that it was
frightening, for as he would stand and perform his tortured dance
he had an eerie resemblance to a man. I'll never forget the pitiful
look on that bear's face as the trainer whipped him with his stiff
cane pole. In human-like fashion the bear placed his paws over
his head to protect himself from the blows. Streaks of red blood
colored his digits. As I stood in the hot sun watching the wincing
bear I began to boil with anger.
<p>
I moved through the crowd with clenched
fists. It would have been so easy to wrench that pole from that
puny little torturer and give him a dose of the pain he was inflicting
on that pitiful bear. One more strike at that bear and I would
have at him, I thought. Then I felt a tug on my arm and heard
the calm, evenly modulated voice of the Englishman whispering
that he felt exactly the same way, but asking me, &quot;What are
you going to do, go to war against the whole Indian nation?&quot;
<p>
&quot;After all,&quot; he added &quot;this
atrocity is but a microcosm of the cruelty that exists here.&quot;
<p>
I stumbled back to the cab wondering
how many times in a man's life he must turn his head when justice
demands he act. Regardless of how much pity I have for the people
if India, it is true that every people ultimately is responsible
for its conditions of life, for its general health and well-being.
After gazing on the poor mistreated animal who has no control
over its destiny, a sadness came over me that was greater than
any I had felt since arriving in this forlorn nation.
<p>
On both sides of the highway onward
to Agra were cattle, thousands of them. The driver explained that
they were sacred. As he explained their religious sanctification
and protection, I thought about the great cattle industry the
nation could have. Later in the shops in Agra, I saw rats and
birds scampering around the food in the bins and not receiving
a second glance from the proprietors or their skinny customers.
In some areas of India even the rats are sacred.
<p>
Agra and New Delhi are far cleaner cities
(by their standards; all are abominable by ours) than the other
large cities like Calcutta or Bombay. In northern India the people
are taller, lighter skinned, and more sturdily built than those
of the hot coastal areas. Occasionally, I encountered a native
Indian who could easily pass for a southern European, or even
a Louisiana Creole. (a Creole has French and Spanish ancestry)
<p>
I had always wanted to see the Taj Mahal.
My father had described it to me a number of times, and my excitement
grew as we neared the famous structure. Anticipation welled-up,
tingling me like a cool breeze across my sweaty body. The Taj
Mahal was built long after the great flowering of the Aryan Civilization,
yet it contains many architectural and artistic qualities that
reflect the earlier era. As we passed through the shaded arches
of the outlying buildings, the whitish-blue, cloudless sky was
bright with glare. Then the great temple came into view, standing
magnificently, gleaming white in the sun. I had stepped out of
the filth, rot, and decay of modern India into an earlier era
of beauty, order and art. Sitting on the edge of the reflecting
pool, I just stared, losing all track of time. It is difficult
for me to describe my emotions, for I was completely overwhelmed
by its beauty. Rodney and I, usually both quite glib, sat motionless
and mute, and when one finally did speak the words automatically
came out in whispers of reverence for the splendor looming before
us.

<p>
After a while, historical reality began
to crowd in on me. I knew that most of the modern day Indian visitors
I saw around me were but poor reflections of the men and women
who walked these grounds centuries ago. Tourists from all over
the world find the temple very beautiful, but once they learn
of its origins, they leave saddened, for the great Taj Mahal was
built as a remembrance, a sepulcher if you will, by a man whose
wife died giving birth to her fourteenth child. I saw it as a
metaphor, a funerary monument to the memory of a people who gave
the earth great beauty.
<p>
Another feeling came over me as I viewed
the Taj Mahal in the sunlight. The rounded dome with its white,
bone-like features resembled a huge skull, symbolizing the spiritual
cranium of the Aryan people, one that once housed and held talented
and powerful minds; but which now only served as a magnificent
gravestone of a high culture and genetic treasure that is no more.
<p>
Unlike the thousands of decaying and
collapsing ancient temples around the rest of India, the Taj Mahal
is not pock-marked. Even just a few inches away, one can view
the overwhelming beauty in its inlaid stones and artwork, just
as one appreciates the architecture from a distance. The cool,
moist air of the interior of the Taj Mahal made me reluctant to
leave and begin the journey back to Delhi.
<p>
On the long road back, Rodney slept,
while I rested my head on the window frame and peered into the
dusty countryside, taking in the sights and sounds as nonchalantly
as if I had traveled on the road a thousand times. When I got
back to the YMCA, I took off my shoes and curled up on my musty
cot, falling asleep with my camera still around my neck.
<p>
A couple days later I decided to explore
some of the other old temples that dot the countryside. I hired
a cab, and it wasn't very long before I spotted a suitable target.
Soon I was walking across a grassy, dry area toward a huge temple
I could see in the distance. A few hundred feet from the paved
highway, I literally stumbled across another road; and it was,
in a word, magnificent. It was extremely old. Only a part of the
road was visible; the rest was covered with sediment. Stone had
been carved in perfect blocks and laid over a base of gravel.
The road was as level as a billiard table and would still be usable
if the weeds that had grown up in the cleavages of the stone were
cut.
<p>
As I walked over the ancient road and
through the thick patches of dry weeds toward the temple, I reviewed
all that I had read about India and all that I had seen firsthand:
the fact that the highest classes were the lightest-skinned, that
nothing was more insulting to an Indian than calling him &quot;black,&quot;
that Varna (caste) is the Indian word for color, that Sanskrit
is an ancient Indo-European language with direct links to every
other European language. A great deal of Sanskrit literature describes
many of the Aryan leaders as having light eyes and light hair.
I thought about the splendor that once was, and about the incessant
squalor I had witnessed since my arrival. I wondered about what
I might find at the temple looming ahead.
<p>
As I got closer to the temple, I noticed
that the dome was partially caved-in. Only two walls were left
standing. Still closer, I saw thousands of pock-marks all over
the structure, each of which once housed a precious stone, but
had long since been picked clean. I wondered if all the temples
and monuments of Europe and America will eventually endure the
same fate as this one.
<p>
Around the corner of the temple, on
the partially shaded side, I saw something that will forever remain
burned in my memory. There in the shade sat a little, brown, half-caste
Indian girl. She was thoroughly emaciated and resembled some sort
of hideous doll, but she moved slightly, and her animated bones
and skin had a terrifying effect. She was so malnourished that
her face had not developed properly, but her eyes were very large,
and in their own way hauntingly beautiful. On one cheek was an
open sore nearly the size of a quarter; there were more sores
on her arms, chest and legs, and each sore was covered by dozens
of flies. Occasionally, she would brush her frail hand over one
of the sores causing the flies to retreat. Inevitably though,
once her hand had passed, they returned to their grim feeding
like iron fillings to a magnet. She held out her hand to me, begging
for a few rupees. I dug my hand deep into my pocket, pulled out
all the Indian coins I had and carefully tipped them softly into
her dark, skeleton-like hand. Turning, I stumbled out into the
hot Indian sun, with my eyes blinded by tears.
<p>
On the way back to my room I wondered
if, in a few hundred years, some half-black descendant of mine
would be sitting among the ruins of our civilization, brushing
away the flies, waiting to die. Every day our nation grows a little
darker from the torrential immigration of non-whites , high non-white
birthrates, and increasing racial miscegenation; and with each
passing day, we see the quality of our lives decline. Crime is
ever on the increase, drug activity proliferates, educational
quality declines, and the American standard of living suffers.
The healthy racial values of our forefathers are ridiculed and
replaced by the pseudo-science of egalitarianism. Treason to our
heritage prospers and corruption feeds in the highest places.

<p>
All that keeps our society afloat are
the small number of scientists and technicians (predominately
Caucasian) who continue to create technological wizardry that
cushions the impact of the economic slide caused by lower individual
productivity, and the dependency of the growing welfare underclass.
Somehow, the increasingly hard-pressed, White middle class keeps
the wheels turning (and taxes flowing into the social structure),
but with lessening efficiency.
<p>
To the plaudits of the media, the Brahmins
of America and the West are slowly being replaced by the pariahs,
the Untouchables. Seeing that child in that prophetic setting
was my glimpse of a remorseless fate toward which the United States
and the Western World are hurdling. If that future is to be altered,
it will require each person who understands the racial truth -
- to forge by this knowledge -- policies that will preserve our
own heritage in our respective nations in the same way we now
seek to preserve the endangered whales or rare eagles.
<p>
The nation of India, like most of the
Third World, has already passed the point of no return. She cannot
feed or otherwise adequately take care of herself, not even with
repeated injections of Western capital, aid, and technology. The
huge populace of modern-day India cannot sustain the level of
culture and economic well-being that its high-caste forebears
originally created.
<p>
It is not, however, too late for America
and the West. No matter how dark our destiny may appear, there
is enough genetic treasure among our people to fashion a road
to the stars. Those who know the racial truth often excuse their
inaction by expressing pessimism. Suggesting that &quot;the battle
is already lost&quot; is often simply an excuse for cowardice.
Our race's evolutionary struggle for survival became the meaning
of my life when I looked into that little Indian girl's forlorn
face, for I then knew exactly what I must do. Prospects of victory
or defeat became irrelevant to my responsibility and my honor.
My life was from that defining moment, in the service of my people
and the Promethean task ahead. 

<img width=144 height=214 hspace=10 border=0 align=right hspace=15 vspace=5 src="images/indian2.gif">
<p>
When I grow tired and weary in this
battle, and I find my character smeared or my personal life attacked,
her gaunt face is there to haunt me, to drive me onward. When
my personal safety, or that of my loved ones is explicitly threatened,
her pleading countenance is there to remind me in the most graphic
human terms what failure means for our progeny. I learned that
I had to take personal responsibility for the well-being of my
people. By that, I don't mean that I felt it was my destiny to
lead, but it was my personal responsibility to do all that I could
for the survival of my heritage. In the crisis our race now faces,
all of us who know the truth must carry that same personal responsibility,
and with it the understanding that any individual danger or suffering
must be endured when the fate of our whole people is at stake.
Such was the altruism that brought our forebears through the crucible
of the Ice Ages of prehistoric Europe, and now we must draw from
that genetically imprinted trait as we stand on the brink of being
inundated by the masses of the Third World.
<p>
Before my journey to India, the racial
ideals that I believed in l abstract concepts and principles.
In the moment I saw that emaciated child in the ruins, all my
thoughts and concepts were dramatically transformed from sterile
contemplations into the reality of flesh and blood. I finally
realized that my cause is different than that of an athletic contest,
business competition, winning of an election, or even struggling
for an important new scientific discovery. It is not about being
right or wrong about ideas, but about life itself; the natural
laws that provide it's beauty, character, and meaning. I had already
committed myself to the struggle for my race's survival long before
I saw that fated child, but that experience changed an intellectual
commitment into an almost holy obligation.
<p>
An often quoted passage from the <i>Bhagavad
Gita</i> came to my mind with powerful meaning:

<p><em><strong>Likewise having regard for duty to
your caste<br>
For in a warrior, there exists no
better thing than<br>
A fight required of duty</strong> 

<p>(Chapter 2, verse 30)</em><br>

<p>
I realized that day in the scorching
Indian sun that I had to adopt the spirit of a warrior -- that
my race was in a life and death struggle that transcended the
centuries. Selfish pursuits seemed trivial, and my life became
from that moment interwoven with the Cause, a Cause that I knew
that I would never abandon. Through years of heartbreak and hardship,
physical weariness and character assassination, but also in the
exhilarating moments of success and acclaim, my heart has remained
true. The flame that ignited in me on that hot August day is still
white hot and imperishable.<br>

<p><h1>What Is Racism?</h1>
<p><h4>by Thomas Jackson</h4>

<p><i>Originally Published in American Renaissance, Vol 2, No. 8
</i>
<hr>
<p>There is surely no nation in the world that holds "racism"
in greater horror than does the United States. Compared to other
kinds of offenses, it is thought to be somehow more
reprehensible. The press and public have become so used to tales
of murder, rape, robbery, and arson, that any but the most
spectacular crimes are shrugged off as part of the inevitable
texture of American life. "Racism" is never shrugged off.        
For example, when a white Georgetown Law School student reported
earlier this year that black students are not as qualified as
white students, it set off a booming, national controversy about
"racism." If the student had merely murdered someone he would
have attracted far less attention and criticism.
      
<p>Racism is, indeed, the national obsession. Universities
are on full alert for it, newspapers and politicians denounce it,
churches preach against it, America is said to be racked with it,
but just what <b>is</b> racism?
      
<p>Dictionaries are not much help in understanding what is
meant by the word. They usually define it as the belief that
one's own ethnic stock is superior to others, or as the belief
that culture and behavior are rooted in race. When Americans
speak of racism they mean a great deal more than this.        
Nevertheless, the dictionary definition of racism is a clue to
understanding what Americans <b>do</b> mean. A peculiarly American
meaning derives from the current dogma that all ethnic stocks are
equal. Despite clear evidence to the contrary, all races have
been declared to be equally talented and hard- working, and
anyone who questions the dogma is thought to be not merely wrong
but evil.
      
<p>The dogma has logical consequences that are profoundly
important. If blacks, for example, are equal to whites in every
way, what accounts for their poverty, criminality, and
dissipation? Since any theory of racial differences has been
outlawed, the only possible explanation for black failure is
white racism. And since blacks are markedly poor, crime-prone,
and dissipated, America must be racked with pervasive racism.
Nothing else could be keeping them in such an abject state.      
                                                                                      
<p>All public discourse on race today is locked into this 
rigid logic. Any explanation for black failure that does not 
depend on white wickedness threatens to veer off into the forbidden
territory of racial differences. Thus, even if today's whites can
find in their hearts no desire to oppress blacks, yesterday's
whites must have oppressed them. If whites do not consciously
oppress blacks, they must oppress them Unconsciously. If no
obviously racist individuals can be identified, then societal
<b>institutions</b> must be racist. Or, since blacks are failing so
terribly in America, there simply must be millions of white
people we do not know about, who are working day and night to
keep blacks in misery. The dogma of racial equality leaves no
room for an explanation of black failure that is not, in some
fashion, an indictment of white people.

<p>The logical consequences of this are clear. Since we are
required to believe that the only explanation for non-white
failure is white racism, every time a non-white is poor, commits
a crime, goes on welfare, or takes drugs, white society stands
accused of yet another act of racism. All failure or misbehavior
by non-whites is standing proof that white society is riddled
with hatred and bigotry. For precisely so long as non-whites fail
to succeed in life at exactly the same level as whites, whites
will be, by definition, thwarting and oppressing them. This
obligatory pattern of thinking leads to strange conclusions.
First of all, racism is a sin that is thought to be committed
almost exclusively by white people. Indeed, a black congressman
from Chicago, Gus Savage, and Coleman Young, the black mayor of
Detroit, have argued that only white people <b>can</b> be racist.
Likewise, in 1987, the affirmative action officer of the State
Insurance Fund of New York issued a company pamphlet in which
she explained that <b>all</b> whites are racist and that <b>only</b> whites
can be racist. How else could the plight of blacks be explained
without flirting with the possibility of racial inequality?      

<p>Although some blacks and liberal whites concede that non-whites
can, perhaps, be racist, they invariably add that non-whites have
been forced into it as self-defense because of centuries of white
oppression. What appears to be non-white racism is so
understandable and forgivable that it hardly deserves the name.
Thus, whether or not an act is called racism depends on the race
of the racist. What would surely be called racism when done by
whites is thought to be normal when done by anyone else. The
reverse is also true.
      
<p>Examples of this sort of double standard are so common,
it is almost tedious to list them: When a white man kills a black
man and uses the word "nigger" while doing so, there is an 
enormous media uproar and the nation beats its collective breast;
when members of the black Yahweh cult carry out ritual murders of
random whites, the media are silent (see AR of March, 1991).
College campuses forbid pejorative statements about non-whites as
"racist," but ignore scurrilous attacks on whites.
      
<p>At election time, if 60 percent of the white voters vote
for a white candidate, and 95 percent of the black voters vote
for the black opponent, it is white who are accused of racial
bias. There are 107 "historically black" colleges, whose
fundamental blackness must be preserved in the name of diversity,
but all historically white colleges must be forcibly integrated
in the name of... the same thing. To resist would be racist.     
      
<p>"Black pride" is said to be a wonderful and worthy thing, but
anything that could be construed as an expression of white pride
is a form of hatred. It is perfectly natural for third-world
immigrants to expect school instruction and driver's tests in
their own languages, whereas for native Americans to ask them to
learn English is racist.
      
<p>Blatant anti-white prejudice, in the form of affirmative
action, is now the law of the land. Anything remotely like
affirmative action, if practiced in favor of whites, would be
attacked as despicable favoritism.
      
<p>All across the country, black, Hispanic, and Asian clubs
and caucuses are thought to be fine expressions of ethnic
solidarity, but any club or association expressly for whites is
by definition racist. The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) campaigns openly for black
advantage but is a respected "civil rights" organization. The
National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP)
campaigns merely for equal treatment of all races, but is said to
be viciously racist.
      
<p>At a few college campuses, students opposed to
affirmative action have set up student unions for whites,
analogous to those for blacks, Hispanics, etc, and have been
roundly condemned as racists. Recently, when the white students
at Lowell High School in San Francisco found themselves to be a
minority, they asked for a racially exclusive club like the ones
that non- whites have. They were turned down in horror. Indeed,
in America today, any club not specifically formed to be a white
enclave but whose members simply happen all to be white is
branded as racist.
      
<p>Today, one of the favorite slogans that define the
asymmetric quality of American racism is "celebration of
diversity." It has begun to dawn on a few people that "diversity"
is always achieved at the expense of whites (and sometimes men),
and never the other way around. No one proposes that Howard
University be made more diverse by admitting whites, Hispanics,
or Asians. No one ever suggests that National Hispanic University
in San Jose (CA) would benefit from the diversity of having
non-Hispanics on campus. No one suggests that the Black
Congressional Caucus or the executive ranks of the NAACP or the
Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund suffer from a
lack of diversity. Somehow, it is perfectly legitimate for them
to celebrate <b>homogeneity</b>. And yet any all-white group - a
company, a town, a school, a club, a neighborhood - is thought to
suffer from a crippling lack of diversity that must be remedied
as quickly as possible. Only when whites have been reduced to a
minority has "diversity" been achieved.
      
<p>Let us put it bluntly: To "celebrate" or "embrace"
diversity, as we are so often asked to do, is no different from
<b>deploring an excess of whites</b>. In fact, the entire nation is
thought to suffer from an excess of whites. Our current
immigration policies are structured so that approximately 90
percent of our annual 800,000 legal immigrants are non-white. The
several million illegal immigrants that enter the country every
year are virtually all non-white. It would be racist not to be
grateful for this laudable contribution to "diversity."        
It is, of course, only white nations that are called upon to
practice this kind of "diversity." It is almost criminal to
imagine a nation of any other race countenancing blatant
dispossession of this kind.
      
<p>What if the United States were pouring its poorest,
least educated citizens across the border into Mexico? Could
anyone be fooled into thinking that Mexico was being "culturally
enriched?" What if the state of Chihuahua were losing its
majority population to poor whites who demanded that schools be
taught in English, who insisted on celebrating the Fourth of
July, who demanded the right to vote even if they weren't
citizens, who clamored for "affirmative action" in jobs and
schooling?
      
<p>Would Mexico - or any other non-white nation - tolerate
this kind of cultural and demographic depredation? Of course not.
Yet white Americans are supposed to look upon the flood of
Hispanics and Asians entering their country as a priceless
cultural gift. They are supposed to "celebrate" their own loss
of influence, their own dwindling numbers, their own
dispossession, for to do otherwise would be hopelessly racist.   
      
<p>There is another curious asymmetry about American racism.
When non- whites advance their own racial purposes, no one ever
accuses them of "hating" another group. Blacks can join "civil
rights" groups and Hispanics can be activists without fear of
being branded as bigots and hate mongers. They can agitate openly
for racial preferences that can come only at the expense of
whites. They can demand preferential treatment of all kinds
without anyone ever suggesting that they are "anti-white."       
                                                                        
<p>Whites, on the other hand, need only express their opposition 
to affirmative action to be called haters. They need only subject
racial policies that are clearly prejudicial to themselves to be
called racists. Should they actually go so far as to say that
they prefer the company of their own kind, that they wish to be
left alone to enjoy the fruits of their European heritage, they
are irredeemably wicked and hateful.
      
<p>Here, then is the final, baffling inconsistency about
American race relations. All non-whites are allowed to prefer the
company of their own kind, to think of themselves as groups with
interests distinct from those of the whole, and to work openly
for group advantage. None of this is thought to be racist. At the
same time, <b>whites</b> must <b>also</b> champion the racial interests of
non-whites. They must sacrifice their own future on the altar of
"diversity" and cooperate in their own dispossession. They are to
encourage, even to subsidize, the displacement of a European
people and culture by alien peoples and cultures. To put it in
the simplest possible terms, white people are cheerfully to
slaughter their own society, to commit racial and cultural
suicide. To refuse to do so would be racism.
      
<p>Of course, the entire non-white enterprise in the United
States is perfectly natural and healthy. Nothing could be more
natural than to love one's people and to hope that it should
flourish. Filipinos and El Salvadorans are doubtless astonished
to discover that simply by setting foot in the United States they
are entitled to affirmative action preferences over native-born
whites, but can they be blamed for accepting them? Is it
surprising that they should want their languages, their cultures,
their brothers and sisters to take possession and put their mark
indelibly on the land? If the once-great people of a once-great
nation is bent upon self-destruction and is prepared to hand
over land and power to whomever shows up and asks for it, why
should Mexicans and Cambodians complain?
      
<p>No, it is the white enterprise in the United States that
is unnatural, unhealthy, and without historical precedent. Whites
have let themselves be convinced that it is racist merely to
object to dispossession, much less to work for their own
interests. Never in the history of the world has a dominant
people thrown open the gates to strangers, and poured out its
wealth to aliens. Never before has a people been fooled into
thinking that there was virtue or nobility in surrendering its
heritage, and giving away to others its place in history.        
Of all the races in America, only whites have been tricked into
thinking that a preference for one's own kind is racism. Only
whites are ever told that a love for their own people is somehow
"hatred" of others. All healthy people prefer the company of
their own kind, and it has nothing to do with hatred. All men
love their families more than their neighbors, but this does not
mean that they hate their neighbors. Whites who love their racial
family need bear no ill will towards non-whites. They only wish
to be left alone to participate in the unfolding of their racial
and cultural destinies.
      
<p>What whites in America are being asked to do is
therefore utterly unnatural. They are being asked to devote
themselves to the interests of other races and to ignore the
interests of their own. This is like asking a man to forsake his
own children and love the children of his neighbors, since to do
otherwise would be "racist."
      
<p>What then, is "racism?" It is considerably more than any
dictionary is likely to say. It is any opposition by whites to
official policies of racial preference for non-whites. It is any
preference by whites for their own people and culture. It is any
resistance by whites to the idea of becoming a minority people.
It is any unwillingness to be pushed aside. It is, in short, any
of the normal aspirations of people-hood that have defined
nations since the beginning of history - but only so long as the
aspirations are those of whites.

<P><B>by Bob Matthews</B></P>

<P>Morris Dees has written a book that purports to be about America's militia
movement entitled <B><I>Gathering Storm</I></B> with a subtitle of <I>America's
Militia Threat</I>. Though the title would make one think it is about the
militia, it is in fact a book largely about Louis Beam, a long-time patriot,
writer, and speaker. The militia movement is mentioned as a by-product
of the attack on Beam.</P>

<P>Dees wastes no time launching his verbal ICBM's at Beam. From the first
sentence to the last page Beam is castigated for his speeches against what
is wrong in America today. Beam's speech at Estes Park, Co. in 1992 plays
a central part of the book. Page one, line one (quoted without Dees' own
distracting commentary) begins thusly:</P>

<UL>
<P>Louis Beam minced no words.</P>

<P>&quot;I warn you calmly, coldly, and wit<TT>h</TT>out reservation that
over the next ten years you will come to hate government more than anything
in your life. The federal government in north Idaho has demonstrated brutally,
horribly, and with great terror how it will enforce its claim that we are
religious fanatics and enemies of the state. We must in one voice, cry
out that we will not tolerate their stinking, murdering, lying, corrupt
government.</P>

<P>Men, in the name of our Father, we are called upon to make a decision,
a decision that you will make in the quietness of your heart, in the still
places of the night.</P>

<P>As you lie on your bed and you look up at the ceiling tonight, you must
answer the question: Will it be liberty or will it be death? As for me,
give me liberty or give me death!&quot;</P>
</UL>

<P>Dees claims that Beam evokes the image of Adolf Hitler speaking to the
assembled millions in pre-war Germany. Reassembling Beam's speech from
the dissection performed by Dees leaves us with something like the following
paragraph, this time with Dees' interjections included.</P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;We bear the torch of light, of justice, of liberty, and we will
be heard,&quot; Beam shouted over the cheers of his audience. &quot;We
will not yield this country to the forces of darkness, oppression, and
tyranny. I cannot compromise with such men, they are men without principle.
I cannot reason with such men, they are men without reason. But I can warn
them, and it is a warning they must take to heart. I and many others in
this country, many in this room tonight , will not roll over and play dead
for your New World Order.&quot; The amens, hallelujahs, and applause that
erupted from the audience made Beam's closing words almost inaudible.</P>
</UL>

<P>Dees believes that &quot;There is nothing harmless about Louis Beam.
Charismatic, intelligent, and well spoken, Beam moves people... He was,
and is, far and away the most dangerous...of leaders.&quot; [I spare the
reader of this review the name calling Dees engages in at this point in
the book]</P>

<P>One thing is for sure. Beam knows the government. In the course of the
speech he makes a forbidding prediction that has sadly come true.</P>

<UL>
<P>&quot;The attack on the Weaver family by federal assassins was an attack
upon every family in the United States. This time the federal terrorists,
masquerading as officers, came for Randy Weaver. Next time they may come
for you... If federal terrorism goes unchallenged, then no one in this
nation is safe. Government terrorism, if ignored, does not go away, but
gets worse. Like a lion having tasted the blood of human victims, they
will come for more, new victims.&quot;</P>
</UL>

<P>Less than a year later black-booted thugs would pour from a cattle truck
in Waco, resulting in the horrible death of nearly a hundred people by
bullets and fire.</P>

<P>It is clear from a quick reading of <B><I>Gathering Storm</I></B> that
Beam's main crime and reason for being targeted by Dees is his ability
to appeal to the hearts of men in his speeches. Those who have heard him
speak often refer to him as the &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; of the American
Right. So is it Hitler or Henry? This is a decision that will be made by
those who listen to him speak. Has Adolf Hitler come to America with a
Texas drawl, or has Patrick Henry returned to once again urge his countrymen
to rebel against government tyranny?</P>

<P>You be the judge. A tape of this speech can be ordered from Stormfront
publications.</P>

<p><em>An Essay by L. R. Beam </em></center>


<p>

The internet, perhaps the last truly free means of information exchange
in the Western World, may soon be choked by censorship and governmental
controls. The circumscribing of the net may cause the death of what has
become the first people-to-people exchange of ideas and information on a
world wide basis.  The forces behind this effort appear at first glance
to be an unlikely coalition of conspirators, the CIA, some Jewish
Religious groups, and various foreign governments.  While this unholy
alliance for censorship and control may seem unusual to some, politics
makes the bed for these strange fellows.  Indisputably, an international
cabal of special interest groups both within and out of governments are
working both openly and secretly to end the unregulated direct exchange
of information between people.  At stake is nothing less then the
regaining of information control which the internet has shattered.  Up
for grabs is nothing more than the  thinking and decision making
abilities of informed men.  

<p>

Information has flowed from the top down for most of this century.
Filtering of information by middle men from government, newspapers,
radio, and then television has left most Americans depending upon Paul
Harvey "for the rest of the story."  Suddenly, almost without warning,
the internet mushroomed into popularity connecting people all over the
world together electronically and thereby threatening the power of those
who disseminate information.   If  information is power,  then the
control of information is more power.  The ideas of men are shaped by
what they are told.  For those who hope to erect a "New World Order"
upon what they view as the antiquated ashes of free speech, control of
the internet has jumped to near top of the list of "things to do." 
Governments and religious groups manipulate and control people by what
they are allowed to know or not know.  A decision has been made by the
information brokers to end unregulated information exchange.  Overnight
the propaganda begins as these forces build their case for control and
censorship.

<p>

Quickly the nightly news lights up with horror stories of pornography on
the net. Minutes later the same channel runs four hours of lurid
programming bringing profanity, sex, sodomitizers and violence into the
homes of viewers who were just shocked about porno on the net.
Newspapers carrier feature length stories about children being lured
from home over the computer telephone line, as if somehow typing a
request to a child for sex over the phone line is more effective than
saying it over the same phone line. The Anti-Defamation League issues a
report saying that bomb plans can be found on the net along with anti-
Jewish opinion.  As if the same were not available in every public
library in the United States.  Politicians in Washington began to talk
about "protecting the children."  The same politicians who's destructive
social policies and no win wars have destroyed more mothers sons than
all the pagan empires of the past.  Rabbi Abraham Cooper calls for
censorship of politically incorrect ideas in Canada and asks for the
establishment of an "internet police."  A delegation from the Nazi-
hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center in Vienna Austria, which has for the
most part ran out of eighty year old former Nazis to hunt, takes on the
new task of information censors and asks Italian Prime Minister
Lamberto Dini, European Union president to back World Jewish Congress
initiatives to stop those who disagree on the impact and importance of 
the holocaust from using the internet. Then in a joint effort of the ADL
and the Simon Wiesenthal Center letters are mailed to Internet service
providers in early 1996 urging providers not to carry messages that
contain non-complimentary opinion about Jews, which is quickly labeled
as "cyberhate speech."  This is but a glimpse of the public efforts of
the information censors to unleash "info police" on the net.  It is
clear that those who have previously served as the middlemen of
politically correct information are distraught at their having been
taken out of the loop.  

<p>

Meanwhile, sources within the federal government, who wish to remain
unnamed, reveal that there are considerable behind the scene efforts to
bring the flow of information under government control.  In the
labyrinthine bunkers of the CIA in Arlington Virginia, a team of
planners has begun discussion on how to control the net by establishing
internet node servers throughout the system that will act as a
"strainer" of unwanted electronic information flow  (there are
indications this process has begun now).  The Army Security Agency
(ASA), which has the worlds most sophisticated signals intelligence and
electronic monitoring capabilities has began setting up clandestine
servers to monitor traffic, catalog, classify, and achieve.  

<p>

>From the above sampling of events, it is clear that both government and
pressure groups with sacred cows to defend have determined that
uncontrolled information flow between people is a threat to their
interests.  The results of this statist thinking will lead to a "war on
information" similar to the  "war on drugs," curtailing free speech and
informed opinion.  Like the war on drugs the real objective will not be
to save society  but rather to control society.  CYBER WARS are breaking
out between the people and government over the flow of information. 
What is wanted by these would be internet thought police is nothing less
then the right of government and religious (in this case Judaism) 
imprimatur on the transfer of electronic information: an electron iron
curtain.

<p>

Efforts at censorship by religious groups are not new to this continent. 
The Spanish Catholic church which saw nothing of value among the
writings of Aztecs and Mayans ordered their books burned in contempt.  
Like them, Rabbi Abraham Cooper and the Anti-defamation League see
nothing of value in the words of those who beg to disagree. Black robed
priests yelled the smear words of the 16th century "Vile heretic!" and
labeled non-catholics "pagan savages."  Rabbi Cooper and his religious
cohorts of the new inquisition cry "anti-Semitic" and label those who
believe differently "hatemongers."  The words have changed, but for
those shouting them the objective is the same: eliminate the opposition,
the opponent is never answered; he is discredited.  Fear kept many
silent who would have otherwise opposed the Catholic Inquisition.  Fear
of the rack and straps of being labeled anti-Semitic will keep many
quite today.   The call now for censorship by Rabbis is much like the
pyres of Priests in the fifteenth century it is an electronic
equivalent of book burning. The zealots willingness to accept only his
personal vision of the world around him has led mankind down this same
pernicious path before. Intolerance it is clear, is not solely a non-
Jewish characteristic.  A new inquisition has begun.  This one will seek
out the heretics of the internet for the stake.   Each age it seems, has
it's TORQUEMADA. 

<p>

A warning of what is to come: as the Federal Government, Anti-Defamation
League, and the Central Intelligence Agency seek to squelch or control
the net, look for senseless acts of random electronic violence.  These
acts of subterfuge will be committed by computer nerds at CIA and the
ADL or their  agent provocateurs and will appear to have been
perpetrated by  "white racists," "neo-nazis," "patriots,"  "extremist
anti-government radicals," "hackers," or other identifiable dissidents
of the right and left.  The purpose of these incidents will be similar
to those of a drive by shooting to terrorize people into submission.  In
this case consent is wanted for censorship rather than drug turf but the
principal is the same: a political/religious gang wants control.
Understand that establishment media, as the propaganda arm of the
government, will on cue make the call for censorship of the net. Those
who have the resources to employ the best politicians money can buy also
own newspapers, radio and television networks,  for all serve their
design.  That design being the control of people through the filtering
of information and repressive laws.  After investing billions of dollars
in media/information empires and politicians,  all geared to work in
tangent keeping people under control, these modern day equivalents of
the book burners of former ages will not willingly let unfettered
information exchange hinder their efforts. With at least four federal
agencies (FBI, CIA, FINCEN, and ASA) investing hundreds of millions in
advanced computer systems designed solely to monitor and track people
technological warfare between the people and government will be a major
component of  the rest of this century and perhaps longer.  

<p>

The new head of the CIA John Deutsch was hand picked by Bill Clinton and
his backers to carry  forward plans for a technological police state to
rest upon the typical shoulders of bullet proof vests, black boots, and
front doors shattering under their assault. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel
Edward G. Lansdale, CIA operative par excellence, personally recruited
the new CIA director for his first Government job in the early 1960's at
just 22.  Deutsch became one of Secretary of Defense Robert MacNamara's
('we never intended to win in Viet Nam') whiz kids in the Pentagon who
would help to design the Vietnam War; a slaughterhouse for other kids
not so fortuity  as to have political connections.  Deutsch has held
political posts under Democratic administrations and advisory or
academic positions during Republican administrations.  Deutsch became
part of the elite permanent government of the United States that is
accountable to no one, and immune to the oversight process.  The shell
game of elections and political parties have no effect on their
careers..  This select cadre move in and out of various Federal agencies
and advisory positions, always on the public dole, never elected,
spending their entire lives trying to control the affairs of others. 
Much like the secret CIA Air Base (Area 51) at Groom Lake in
southeastern Nevada, there is an aureole of secrecy surrounding their
lives and functions.   Deutsch's grandfather was a diamond merchant who
ran the Zionist Federation of Belgium and he is therefore expected to
work closely with the ADL and other pro-censorship groups.  President
Clinton appointed Deutsch as Director Central Intelligence in May of
1995 at the moment when the bombing of the Federal kindergarten in
Oklahoma had allowed his Administration to launch a maximum
political/propaganda counter-offensive against the rapidly growing
discontent with, and mistrust of  the federal government.  Black smoke,
mutilated bodies, dying children, crying distraught mothers, created
exactly the atmosphere the government needed to turn things around. 
John Deutsch is the man in charge of that effort for the government.

<p>

Censorship is a word of many meanings.  In a narrow sense it of course
may refer to suppression of information, or ideas.  In a broader sense
however, it is the rape of the human mind:  Taking away that which is
needed to make fair, informed opinions about this life.  The mental
rapist of today is no different in his goals than the back ally pervert
who by force assaults a defenseless woman, taking from someone else that
which he has no right to.  Both acts are the works of the most
contemptible sorts of humankind, desperate men, fearful of the light of
day.  What is being called for by the online information censors is the
equivalent to Bosnian  ethnic cleansing' a sort of information cleansing
of the internet.  

<p>

It seems ironic to many that the ADL which has made innumerable calls
for "diversity" would spearhead these efforts at censorship. What is
being called for by them, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and Rabbi Cooper
is the equivalent to Bosnian ethnic cleansing' a sort of information
cleansing of the internet.  Perhaps a new organizational motto of  
"Many Cultures, One Opinion" would be more in line with true ADL
objectives. It is not  just a little bit odd that the same people who
fear firearms in the hands of the people fear information in the minds
of people. The ADL supported the recent government ban on certain types
of firearms just as it supports government action to censor the net.  As
firearms laws only disarm honest citizens who obey the laws, information
bans only effect people who desire to think for themselves.  One pundit
has already quipped that "I'll give up my information when they pry my
cold dead fingers from the keyboard."

<p>

In closing the author would like to make two additional things clear. 
First, there are Jews who oppose censorship although to this point their
voice is but a whisper compared to the intolerance of the Anti-
Defamation League and Rabbi Cooper.  Second, that writing about Jewish
religious leaders and government spymasters operating in a collusive
effort to erect an electron iron curtain to restrict freedom of speech
and information does not make one anti-Semitic or anti-government.  The
truth <em>is</em> anti-Semitic.  The government <em>is</em> erecting a police state.  The
author opposes both oppressive religious groups and repressive
government.  If speaking the truth and opposing tyranny makes one anti-Semitic 
and anti-government, then I am both...

<br>

<br>Technological wonders of which others can only dream...
<p>All these are achievements of the White race, very possibly the greatest race that has ever walked the face of this earth.
But who is the White race, and where did they come from?
<p>Broadly speaking there are three main sub divisions within the White race - Nordic, Alpine and Mediterranean.
<h3>SUB GROUPS</h3>
<p>Although these names seem to be referring to geographic places, they did in fact originally mean certain physical types.
<p>The Nordic sub group is recognizable by their tallness, light hair and eye colour and long skull.
<p>The Alpine sub group is recognizable by their shorter stature, round skulls and brown eyes and hair.
<p>The Mediterranean sub group is recognizable by their middle size stature, and their dark eyes and hair. The Mediterranean skull shape can be long or round.
<p>There are other sub groupings of the White Race, but these are generally mixed types - for example the Dinarics (found in Poland especially) who have light hair and eyes but the round skulls of the Alpine - the product of a Nordic - Alpine mix.
<h3>ORIGIN</h3>
<p>When did this broad category of races appear?
<p>Evolutionists would have you believe that the human kind originated in Africa, and as this early man migrated north, so did his pigmentation become light and his eye and hair colour lighter - by evolution of course.
<p>Creationists would have you believe that mankind was created by a God suddenly somewhere in the Middle East.
<p>Both theories are just that - theories, and the archaeological evidence tells quite a different story. The archaeological evidence consists of skeletal remains found at various sites around the world. From these skeletal types we can determine the size and physical features of the people who lived at that time.
<h3>NEANDERTHAL MAN</h3>
<p>What we see is that until about 40,000 or 30,000 years ago there was a race of beings who walked upright - called Homo Erectus. Homo Erectus was a two-legged creature who possessed very low mental faculties. This Homo Erectus is what is commonly known as Neanderthal man. His physical features were a small skull and particularly small cranial - brain - capacity. His arms were longer in relation to his body size that Homo Sapiens, and he was prognathic - a fancy scientific term which means that the forehead slopes back and the teeth stick out significantly - usually further than the furthest point of the nose or the chin.
<p>The evolutionists would have us believe that Homo Sapiens (which is Latin for Wise Man) evolved from Homo Erectus - but of course this is where the evolutionary theory falls flat - there is no conclusive genetic link between Neanderthal man and Homo Sapiens. On the contrary, the archaeological evidence would indicate that at the end of the last great ice age - which may have lasted hundreds of thousands of years and which only finally receded about 40,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens appeared out of the north and swept down through Europe, physically destroying Neanderthal man.
<h3>UPPER PALEOLITHIC</h3>
<p>For 20,000 years during this closing ice age - called the Upper Paleolithic period - a term referring only to the type of culture that existed amongst these early Homo Sapiens - our ancestors, the White race's ancestors, lived as hunter gatherers in Europe.
<p>Their physical remains and artifacts from this time are plentiful - and what is really amazing is how far spread out they were. This first race of people with whom we can claim a genetic affinity, were what is called the proto Nordic racial type - tall, light hair and eyes.
<p>In certain isolated areas in Europe you can still find perfect living examples of this racial type, and they differ only slightly in height from modern day Nordics.
<p>This great proto Nordic race lived in a broad band spanning from Spain right across Europe all the way to central Asia and even to the Pacific rim, where skeletal remains have been found as well.
<p>In Siberia and Asia they were eventually absorbed by the Mongoloid races and the same happened in the Pacific rim - for example the Ainu people of Japan - that society's highest class - are very clearly crosses of Mongoloids and Whites. They differ so substantially from the rest of the Japanese population that this is visible even to the Western eye.
<h3>PASTORAL PEOPLE</h3>
<p>When this great Ice age finally ended, some of these White hunters became a pastoral people. The first artifacts made from bone and stone date from this period - about 35,000 years ago. With established settlements came developments such as fire, paintings stone blades and the fashioning of animal bones into weapons and tools. Sewing needles were also developed during this period.
<p>Musical instruments also made their appearance- at certain sites in Southern France flutes dating back 27,000 years have been found. A typical settlement would have about 5 to 20 families living together. Coal was also first used as a fuel at about this time.
<p>They fired clay statues in ovens, had bows and arrows (a weapon which first appeared on the scene about 10,000 years ago).
<p>Their greatest failing was that they left no written records of their achievements - only paintings on rock walls.
<h3>ALPINES AND MEDITERRANEANS</h3>
<p>With the total disappearance of the Ice Age certain biological changes did start to creep into this proto Nordic race. In Southern and Central Europe, a process of an increasing head breadth began to develop which eventually resulted in the Alpine race.
<p>The Mediterranean race also appeared at about this time - also originally of Nordic extraction, it appears as if they developed their own physical characteristics due to long periods of isolation around the Mediterranean basin.
<p>I must stress here that what we today know as "Mediterraneans" are in fact different to these original Mediterraneans. The Mediterraneans commonly referred to today are much darker that the original Mediterraneans. The reason for this difference we will see presently.
<p>The most well preserved example of this age comes from caves in Southern France, called the Azilian culture, after the caves at Mes d'Azil. Here stones were found with what appears to be writing on them dating from this period - but they have never been deciphered and it remains to this day speculation as to what they exactly are.
<h3>NEOLITHIC AGE</h3>
<p>As climatic conditions improved, so occurred what is called the Neolithic revolution. Again, this is a fancy term indicating only a change in living style. Neolithic means the establishment of farms and crops and even more settled lifestyles.
<p>Although there are isolated examples of proto Nordics having established farms at the beginning of the Neolithic period in Northern Europe, the fact is that the climatic conditions were not ripe for large scale farming. The proto Nordics, Alpines and darker Mediterraneans who were living in the more climatically favourable Middle East were the first to start with large scale farming and settlements. Cereal crops were planted in the Middle east 10,000 years ago. 
<p>The cereal grain farmers spread their skills westwards, penetrating central Europe about 8000 years ago - when these crops first started appearing in Italy and the Balkans.
<h3>SEMITES AND MONGOLS</h3>
<p>Here we must of course bear in mind that the inhabitants of the Middle East at this period in history were not the same people who inhabit that region now! The Semites and Mongols (who lived further east) were still migrating North and West from ancient homelands in the South and East. 
<p>The people who lived in the Middle East at the time we are talking about now were a mixture of proto Nordics, Alpines and Mediterraneans, with Mediterraneans being in the majority. Although they do not predate the Upper Paleothic settlements in Europe - they can most certainly be said to have provided much of the impetus for early White civilization.
<p>Having said that, it was so that almost without fail the leadership elite of these Middle Eastern inhabitants were Nordics. A few examples: the first Egyptian societies were clearly White. The majority of the population were Mediterraneans, while the leadership elite was Nordic. The mummified remains of numerous pharaohs and common folk from the first great Egyptian civilization have these undeniable racial characteristics, while the first written reference to blond hair is made on the wall of the tomb of the pharaoh Cheops - his daughter, Queen Hetep-Heres II, is identified as having blond hair. Cheops was of course the builder of the great Pyramids we still see today outside Cairo.
<p>These racial types dominated in the Middle East for nearly 10,000 years, eventually being displaced and intermingle with massive waves of Semitic and Mongoloid invaders.
<h3>SUMERIA</h3>
<p>The first great White Egyptian civilization was in fact predated by about some 3000 years by the great Sumerian civilization - another  population whose racial make up was predominantly Mediterranean with a Nordic ruling elite.  This civilization, founded between the two great rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, even built pyramids - called Ziggurats - of their own long before the Egyptians apparently stole the idea from them.
<p>The Sumerian civilization was the first truly literate civilization, and was established as late as 3000 BC - some 5000 years ago. The most famous city state of the Sumerians was Babylon, which later became one of the wonders of the ancient world because of its beautiful hanging gardens. 
<p>The first great novel - a recreational work of fiction, was written down in Babylon - The Epic of Gilgamesh (which interestingly enough has as part of its story line the flooding of the world - clearly this was from where the later Hebrew religionists took the idea of Noah's Ark and the flood.)
<p>The first written law statutes also date from this Sumerian civilization - the Law code of Hammurabi, which dates from 1 760 BC.
<p>A number of other smaller White civilizations sprang up at this time in this region as well, each of them contributing in their own way to the advancement of civilization.
<h3>CARTHAGE</h3>
<p>Amongst them were the Phonecians, a people originally of Greek origin who established our modern alphabet and through trade established themselves as a powerful nation in the Mediterranean. The Phoenicians founded the city of Carthage, in present day Tunis, just opposite the bottom of the Italian peninsula. Carthage was of course to become one of the Roman empire's greatest enemies.
<h3>OLD EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION</h3>
<p>The neolithic (farming) revolution slowly spread through Europe, first along the Grecian peninsula, Italy, up the Danube River and reaching Northern Europe about 7000 years ago.
<p>These civilizations are what is know as the "Old European civilization" and included such places as Crete (the palace at that island's capital city, Knossos, had by the way, the first running water toilets - this about 4500 years ago!)
<h3>MODERN NORDIC</h3>
<p>By this time the modern day Nordic racial type had fully developed, and it may come as news to some of you that original large Nordic concentrations were not in fact in Scandinavia, but in modern day Ukraine and South Eastern Russia (hence Whites are mistakenly called Caucasians - after the Causacas mountains - by those who don't know better).
<p>The town of Kiev, was for example one of the biggest Nordic cities, dating from about 7000 years ago, and had a population of 20,000 - huge by standards of the time.
<p>These Nordics slowly crept westward, invading and re-invading Western Europe for a period of nearly 6000 years, finally resulting in the establishment of a new Nordic heartland in Northern Europe.
<p>These people developed a linear script and their own language. Very little of this language remains, although there are those who argue that the Hungarian language - which is exclusive and bears no relation to any other European language except to a Baltic dialect - is the purest surviving example of this language.
<p>These original Nordic tribes had stone buildings and worked bronze and copper. How much of this metal working skill was passed South to the Middle Eastern civilizations remains a matter of debate.
<p>However, what is for sure is that successive waves of Nordic tribes started invading central and Southern Europe in earnest about 6 400 years ago, and caused the Mediterranean civilizations (the "Old European" civilizations) to topple. Nordic tribes occupied large regions of Turkey, Crete, Greece and Southern Europe and Italy.
<p>The invading Nordics did not kill the largely Mediterranean populations of these areas - obviously feeling some type of racial kinship, but instead just ruled over them.
<p>Some Nordic tribes migrated into the Far East - as far as China, where some Nordic remains have been found in burial chambers. The details we have about this is too sketchy to speculate on what effect this may have had on the undeniably advanced Chinese culture.
<p>These Nordic tribes also invaded Egypt, but were in turn occupied by a Semitic invasion - the Hyskos, who wee only expelled after 100 years of their rule.
<h3>GREECE</h3>
<p>It was some of these invading Nordic tribes, around the year 2100 BC  - some 4000 years ago - laid the basis for the great age of Greek culture. From this period we owe much in terms of philosophers, mathematicians and great soldiers. This flowering of Greek civilization lasted till just after the founding of the greatest empire the world has known, in Rome.
<p>In 1595AD - some 3500 years ago - the city of Babylon was captured by these Nordic invaders. Another invading tribe was called the Philistines by the Egyptians - and these people established what is believed to be a harsh rule over the increasing number of Semites in the Middle East. The Semites developed a fanatical hatred of the Philistines, which they developed into their religion. 
<p>This was developed to the point where today anyone who has been raised a Christian knows that to call someone a Philistine is to insult him, even though the person using that insult may not even know who the Philistines were.
<h3>INDO-ARYANS</h3>
<p>Around the year 1500 BC - say 3500 years ago - Nordic tribes, who were sun worshippers, and who used the sanskrit (or Sumerian) language and their symbols, invaded central Asia and occupied territory as far as the North of India. These invaders were what is known as the Indo-Europeans, or the original Aryans. In fact, all of those countries spanning their age of conquest bear names directly related to them - India, Iran, Iraq are all corruptions of the original word Aryan.
<p>One of the symbols the Aryans had was the sunwheel, representing the sun and well being, which later developed into the swastika. This symbol was taken up in to the Indo-Aryan's religion, and transported over into the Hindu religion, which sprang from a corruption of the Indo-Aryans' beliefs. To this day you will find swastikas in Hindu temples across the world.
<p>Up until this time then, the development of White race's territorial expansion was such that they were a majority in Europe and Western Russia. Nordics ruled as an elite over a largely Mediterranean population into the Middle East. In areas further East, that is Iran and Northern India, the population grew steadily darker and less White, till at the furthest outpost in India the Nordic invaders were a distinct minority.
<h3>TURNING POINT</h3>
<p>At this stage in history the first great turning point in White civilization came about. The White Egyptians started using Nubian - or Black - labour to provide the manpower needed to build their great pyramids, while in other Central Eastern countries the Semitic or Arabic populations began to increase as they too were increasingly used as labour by the ruling Whites.
<p>Herein lies the key to understanding the rise and fall of all civilizations - as long as a race maintains its territorial integrity and does not start to rely on others to provide its labour, that civilization will stand intact. Once it starts to allow large numbers of other races into its midst, to do the labour, then that civilization falls. 
<p>A civilization stands or falls by the homogeneity of its population, and nothing else.
<p>To digress for one minute to explain this another way : no-one will argue that the Chinese people have built a civilization in China. If however the Australian aborigines had to immigrate to China in their millions, then in a few years the character of Chinese civilization would changed to that of an aboriginal one. 
<p>Those who occupy the territory, not those who own the territory, determine the nature of that society. This is an immutable law which cannot be escaped.
<h3>INDIA</h3>
<p>In India, for example, the Indo- Aryans established a strict segregation system to keep themselves separate from the local native population. This system was so strict that it has lasted to this day as is today known as the caste system. However, even the strictest segregation (and punishments such as death for miscegenation) did not prevent the majority population from eventually swallowing up the ruling Nordics till today when only a few very high caste Brahmin Indians could still pass as Europeans.
<p>Now exactly the same thing happened in central Asia, Egypt, Sumeria, and to a lesser degree, Turkey. Slowly but surely, as these civilizations relied more and more on others to do their work for them, their population became darker and darker. Today Egypt is not populated by the people who built the pyramids - and the same applies to any other original site of White culture in that region.
<h3>GREECE</h3>
<p>The Nordic civilizations in Greece also fell prey to this trap, and the last great Grecian leader, Pericles, actually enacted a law in the year 451 BC limiting citizenship of the state by racial descent. However, some 400 years later this law was changed as the population shifts had become more and more evident. Today there are significant genetic differences between many inhabitants of Greece and the original inhabitants of that country, although this change is not as complete as in a place such as Egypt.
<p>Thus, only the Nordics who invaded Eastward into Europe, have left any significant genetic heritage today, mainly because the original inhabitants of this region were genetically compatible with the Nordic invaders.
<h3>ALEXANDER THE GREAT</h3>
<p>Possibly one of the best known rulers of the period leading up the Christian year 0 was Alexander the Great. His tribe of Nordic invaders had settled the land known as Macedonia - just to the north of present day Greece. Alexander set about invading the already struggling Greece and eventually most of the known world, including poor old Egypt once again. 
<p>Alexander was however an exponent of multi culturalism, and established his new capital at Babylon. He even forced his army's senior officers to take Asiatic wives!
<p>Upon Alexander's' early death at Babylon, virtually all of his senior officers who had been forced into these multi racial marriages renounced their Asiatic wives, and Alexander's empire was split up amongst his generals. 
<p>The most famous one of these generals was Ptolemy, who established the Ptolemic reign in Egypt. The best known Ptolemic Egyptian queen was Cleopatra, who was of course born in Macedonia and not in Egypt at all. This Ptolemic reign provided a new short lease of life to Egypt, but soon the by then overwhelmingly Arabic population took over once again.
<h3>ROME</h3>
<p>Then came the great civilization of Rome. Originally the inhabitants of the Italian peninsula were settled neolithic - or agricultural Mediterranean peoples, but starting about 1000 BC - 3000 years ago - Italy also fell victim to the invading bands of Nordics flooding across Eastern Europe. In the 9th century BC the last of these Nordic invasions took place - and the last tribe to invade carried the name the Latini - and it is from them that the word Latin came.
<p>Together with other invading Nordic tribes, the Latini amalgamated with the Mediterraneans in Italy and formed the core of the Roman people. 
<p>One of the most prominent of the Mediterranean peoples in Italy before the arrival of the Latini, were the Etruscans, and for a long while they in fact ruled over the Nordic tribes coming south. The Etruscans were the first established and civilized - in the sense of having an establishes system of reading, writing, technology and so on - in Italy.
<p>In 753 the city of Rome was established, and was immediately under the control of the Etruscan rulers. The Etruscan king was however expelled from Rome in the year 509 BC.
<p>By the 4th century BC - 2000 years ago - the Latini, or as the became known the Romans, after their great city, had become the dominant tribe in all Italy. They were predominantly Nordic in racial make-up, with a fair admixture of Mediterranean blood.
<p>The Romans quickly advanced beyond all of their neighbours because they were the first to systemize and organize the state into a modern bureaucracy. Laws, Army discipline, training, advanced weaponry and learning enabled them to start conquering all of the less civilized peoples around them, and they soon conquered virtually all of Western Europe, including the British Isles, where the neolithic age had been plodding on uninterruptedly for many years.
<p>The only time that the Romans were in fact stopped was by their distant Nordic cousins in central Germany. The Germanic king Herman inflicted a massive defeat upon the Roman forces at the battle of Detmold in the year 9AD, and the Romans then never advanced further eastward in Germany past the present day city of Cologne.
<p>The Roman Empire however also extended South and East - and included many peoples into its reign who were definitely not Roman stock material.
<p>The city of Carthage proved to be one of Rome's greatest foes, and it was only after several years' fierce war and an invasion of Italy by the Great Carthaginian leader, Hannibal, that Rome finally overcame the city. The way they dealt with Carthage was insightful of the Roman mindset of the time - they killed all males, enslaved the females, burned the city down and then ploughed it over, pouring salt in the furrows. Nothing ever even grew on that place again.
<p>Citizenship rights, which were at the beginning jealously guarded and in fact racially linked - only Roman citizens born in Rome of Roman parents could become citizens - were changed as the Empire expanded. With each new conquest and addition,  the definition of citizenship become broader and broader.
<p>Cato the Censor, a Roman leader who lived from 234 to 149 BC was one who saw the dangers of extending citizenship rights to non Romans, and he tried to introduce a number of measures to boost the Roman birthrate and to exclude foreigners.  Augustus Caesar followed this up by issuing a decree that every Roman male between the age of 25 and 60 must be married - an hopefully produce offspring. In 9AD the Roman government announced tax concessions for Roman citizens having large families.
<p>All these efforts were ultimately in vain, and by the year AD 70, all manner of foreigners had been given Roman citizenship. In this way the Romanised Jew Josephus, who wrote an excellent account of the Roman war with the Jews in Palestine, was actually employed by the Romans to write that history.
<h3>PALESTINE</h3>
<p>The issue of Palestine and the Jews must be addressed quickly as a religion which came from this region - Christianity - has played such a pivotal role in modern Western Civilization.
<p>What happened in Palestine was that a Semitic tribe called the Hebrews had set up a particularly ethnocentric religion - a God for a specific people, which was a new concept amongst religions, as all other Gods could be for all people, but the Hebrew God was only for the Hebrew tribe.
<p>A small band of Hebrew heretics however objected to this ethnocentric religion, and founded a break away sect, called the Essenes. The Essenes preached that their God was in fact a god for all people, and they objected to the more chauvinist Hebrew god. The Essenes were persecuted by the majority of Hebrew tribe elders, and they were forced to hide many of their works and writings - and this is where the now famous Dead Sea Scrolls come form.
<p>The Essenes claimed that one of their leaders who had been persecuted had been able to perform miracles and had risen from the dead. Although these Essene claims have never been substantiated, it certainly appears to have been the basis or role model for the Jesus Christ of the Christian New Testament.
<h3>MISSIONARIES</h3>
<p>This Essene religion was reworked and revamped extensively after the Roman Jewish War of AD 70, and some Jewish converts to it set themselves up as missionaries and started trying to convert the rest of the world - after failing fairly spectacularly to convert any large numbers of Hebrews themselves.
<p>The most well known of these early missionaries was Paul of Tarsus, whose real name was of course Saul of Tarsus.
<p>Incidentally, the first Roman reference to Jesus Christ was made in Josephus' book The Jewish wars, which appeared in AD 70. In this book passing reference is made to a sect amongst Jews which claimed that the messiah, Jesus Christ, had been to them. It is interesting that the Biblical figure of Jesus Christ does not appear in any prior Roman records, especially when he is supposed to have played such a major role in the time period around the year 0.
<p>Despite their best efforts, the new cult's missionaries - who started calling themselves Christians as the story about Jesus was built up over several years - did in fact not have things all their own way. The Christian religion did battle with a number of other religions in the Middle East and in the Roman Empire - and the Christians were of course persecuted furiously by more than one Roman emperor who tried to stamp out what they saw as a subversive religion.
<h3>EDICT OF MILAN</h3>
<p>Christianity was in fact just another cult until the year 313, when the Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan guaranteeing equal status to all religions, including Christianity, in the Roman Empire.
<p>The reason why he did this remains a matter of debate. There is a evidence to show that his mother was an early Christian convert, and influenced him, but the popular story is that as he was about to do battle with a rival Roman general for the throne, he saw a flaming Cross in the sky with the words In Hoc Signo Vinces - In this sign you will win. He allegedly took this as a sign from the Christian God that he would win if he converted to Christianity. Constantine did win, and did officially convert to Christianity.
<p>With the conversion of the Emperor of the Rome to Christianity, the veritable flood gates opened and almost overnight Christianity became the most popular religion in the Roman Empire.
<p>In the year 325 Constantine called together what is known as the Council of Nicosea, where elders of the foundling church actually physically put the Bible together, discarding chapters and books of loose manuscripts that Christian preachers had been using for years - when they did not fit in with the whole story.
<p>Constantine also founded a new city, which he wanted to be a Christian city unsullied by the paganism of Rome. Modestly, he called the city Constantinople, nowadays called Istanbul.
<h3>EMPIRE SPLIT</h3>
<p>The new Eastern capital soon became more important than Rome itself, to the point that 50 years after Constantine's death, the empire was formally divided into two - the Eastern and the Western empires, each with their own capitals.
<h3>ATTILLA THE HUN</h3>
<p>The Western Roman Empire had long since been battling to contain the Nordic Germanic tribes battering against its northern borders. The German tribes had until then been relatively stable but in 451 AD they were propelled into action by a Mongolian invasion from the Far East under the great Mongoloid leader, Attilla the Hun. The Huns, being ferocious warriors and excellent horsemen, demolished the Nordic tribes situated to the East, by name the Ostrogoths. 
<p>The other German, or Gothic tribes actually petitioned the Romans for help against the Huns. Attilla however had everything his own way for as long as he lived, and the Mongoloid Huns' threat to Europe was only finally defeated after he died in 453 AD.
<h3>ROME SACKED</h3>
<p>The largest remaining Gothic tribe, the Visigoths, then launched a renewed assault on the  Western Roman Empire, under a dynamic leader name Alaric.  This tribe sacked Rome in the year 410 AD, and although there remained thereafter a semblance of emperors after this, in reality the Western Empire had disappeared. Historians mark the official end of the Western Empire in the year 476, when a German general, Adovacarr, who had been employed as mercenary by the Roman government, simply declared himself ruler of Rome without bothering to seek anybody's approval.
<h3>ISLAM</h3>
<p>The Eastern Empire did not far much better - surrounded by for the most part by racially alien elements, the furthest extent of the Christian outpost which Constantine had hoped for was quickly reduced to the immediate territory surrounding the city of Constantinople itself. The lands of virtually the entire Middle East had also by this time undergone huge racial changes, so that the vast majority of inhabitants were no longer racially classifiable as White. 
<h3>HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE</h3>
<p>In the West, meanwhile, the Gothic invaders quickly realized that they were in many respects culturally inferior to the Romans, and quickly took on the Roman ways of learning and government.
<p>The Gothic tribes began to settle themselves in distinct areas - with the Franks setting in present day France, the Saxons and Angles settling in the British Isles after the withdrawal of the last Roman legions there around 300AD, and so on.
<p>Each king of the various Gothic tribes all aspired to be like the Romans before them, and collectively they laid the basis for the origin of the Holy Roman Empire - an attempt to emulate the Roman days of Glory but this time with Christianity as well.
<h3>CHARLEMAGNE</h3>
<p>A series of Christian kings in Europe cemented the victory of Christianity, the most famous of which was Charlemagne, who succeeded to the Frankish throne in 758 AD. He ruled over what is today Western Germany and France, and he was a furious Christian missionary who did not hesitate to kill non believers. In one well known and documented incident, Charlemagne had 5000 Odinist Saxons beheaded in front of the Roman based head of the Christian Church, the pope, and then went about mass as usual, according to his biographer, the monk Einhard.
<h3>PAGAN RITUALS</h3>
<p>Through sheer terror rather than logical persuasion, Christianity then became the dominant religion of the previously pagan Europe -although they never quite succeeded in rooting out some pagan customs. 
<p>Easter, for example, comes from the old pagan god of fertility, Eoster (or Ostara), who used as her symbols the egg and the rabbit - potent signs of fertility. Most Christians today of course have no idea where their Easter bunny comes from, or why we still today have Easter Eggs. What happened was that the Eoster feast marked the start of Spring in Europe, and as this celebration as to deeply ingrained in these Gothic tribes, the Christianising Church elders simply took this feast and in arbitrary fashion made it into the date of Jesus Christ's cruxifiction.
<p>The same happened with the Winter solstice- originally a pagan celebration to mark the turning point of winter - the longest night of winter - with a fire and a pine tree. Solstice was then combined with the date of Jesus Christ's birth, again in an arbitrary fashion.
<p>However, the church was for a long time uneasy with the pagan undertones of the celebration - after all, pine trees, which are native to Scandinavia, and the exchange of gifts are nowhere to be found in the Bible - and this led to the church officially banning the celebration of Christmas no less than three times - all of course unsuccessfully.<p>In any event, by hook or by crook, Western Europe was, for the most part, won over to Christianity.
<h3>MUSLIM INVASION</h3>
<p>The Frankish king Charlemagne did not only spend his converting pagans at sword point - he also undertook several successful attacks against Islam - all in the name of Christianity. Islam propagated conversion by the sword, and this inspired (and still inspires) many Muslims to regard it as their duty to wage a holy war for their God, who strangely enough, if one reads the Koran properly, is the same God as of the Old and New Testament of the Christians.
<p>This zeal caused Islamic armies to invade both North Africa, Spain, the Balkans and Greece at various stages in history, occupying these territories for nearly 400 years at a time. They were eventually driven off by combined Christian - read White - armies, but 400 years of Muslim occupation left a clear genetic mark on the population. The Muslim/White racial mixes in these regions is today quite incorrectly labelled by those who do not know better as the Mediterranean people. They are in reality Arabic - Mediterranean crosses.
<p>Just as a matter of interest, the Muslims in Bosnia that we hear so much about these days also dates from the Islamic invasion of the Balkan peninsula.
<h3>CRUSADES</h3>
<p>Although the Islamic invasion into Europe was beaten off, the Christian invasion of Palestine to try and dislodge the Muslims there - called the Crusades, and which lasted nearly 150 years, were a failure. Constantinople, the last Eastern Christian outpost, had by the time of the Crusades, been reduced to city state status, and eventually fell to Islam in 1453.
<p>A renewed Islamic offensive into Eastern Europe was only turned back in 1532 when a Turkish Muslim army was defeated outside Vienna in that year. This battle marked the last Islamic invasion of Europe until the second half of the 20th century - our era, when a renewed non violent wave of Muslim immigration into Europe started.
<h3>DARK AGES</h3>
<p>The introduction of Christianity into Europe had one important side affect at this time - the doctrinal teachings actually forbid much intellectual development. Ironically it was up to some Arabic Muslims, who had seized ancient pagan Greek and Roman works during their forays into Europe, who kept alive much of these writings and teachings. The Roman Catholic Church - as the first original Christian church was called - very often simply outlawed any pagan works, suppressing them and persecuting anybody who tried to study them. 
<p>In this way for example, the astronomer Nicolas Copernicus, who, based on his reading of ancient Greek astronomical texts and his own observations, claimed in public that the sun was the centre of the universe, and not the earth, as was claimed by the Church. 
<p>The Church had him place under house arrest for this - but he was lucky. Many other scientists were branded as devils or witches and actually killed for making simple scientific observations. 
<p>The Church for example tried very hard to suppress evidence that the earth was round - although the Ptolemic Egyptians had known this centuries earlier, and they had in fact calculated the circumference of the earth. The Church quoted the scriptures as specifically referring to the four corners of the earth, and, as only a square can have corners, it was un Biblical to say that the earth was round.
<p>This suppression of learning brought about what is today known as the Dark Ages in Europe - the emergence of the Church as the most powerful factor in life in Europe. This was the age of the theocratic state, where the church held absolute sway, even over kings. 
<p>Learning was brought to a halt. Feudalism reigned supreme, society was divided into peasants, nobles and the clergy, and social divisions were created which have scarred Europe to this day.
<h3>RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION</h3>
<p>This absolute control by the Roman Catholic Church was broken by two events: the Reformation and the Renaissance. The Reformation started out as a theological revolt against certain teachings, but soon developed into a full blown political revolt against rule from Rome.  A large number of Christians broke with the Catholic Church, protesting certain teachings - and became known as "protestants." 
<p>The Anglican Church was of course founded by the English King Henry 8 after the Pope refused to allow him to divorce one of his unfortunate wives - surely a good enough reason to start a new church if ever there was one! Still today the Anglican church is counted as one of the Protestant churches.
<p>The Luther led Reformation started in Germany and quickly spread to most Northern European countries - and thereupon followed a series of religious wars between Catholics and Protestants which, it has been estimated, killed nearly one third of Europe's population. Lingering elements of this conflict lie at the root of the conflict in Northern Ireland to this day.
<p>In some countries the Catholics regained control - in others they lost. Germany still to this day has an interesting division - the south is Catholic and the north Protestant. This was the basis of a war known was the Thirty years which virtually destroyed Germany as these two Christian groups battled each other for supremacy, each claiming to have the true version of the ultimate truth.
<p>The Renaissance - which is French for rebirth or renewal - allowed the open rereading for the first time in centuries of ancient pagan works, scientific development and technological advances. It was as if a curse had been lifted - suddenly it was no longer dangerous to be a scientist, or to explore the unknown. It was truly a rebirth of civilization, emerging from the Church imposed Dark Ages.  
<p>It is no coincidence that the end of the age of the theocratic state also marked the start of a new surge in Western civilization.
<p>Suddenly Europe was on the advance - scientific breakthroughs, great works of art, the discovery of new worlds - there seemed to be no end to it. Explorers set out to discover sea routes around Africa, to the Americas, to India. 
<p>White settlements were established in the most far flung corners of the globe - from Australia to South Africa, from America to Canada.
<h3>NEW WORLDS, OLD FACTS</h3>
<p>In each of these places, great feats and exceptional heroism was displayed by the European settlers in taming these wild lands. In America and South Africa, Great Treks of equal ardour and bravery were undertaken, and in all the colonies little replicas of Europe were established. 
<p>However, once again the faults that the ancient civilizations had made, were made in the new colonies. Instead of flooding the new areas with their own kind to do the labour, the colonists found that it was apparently easier to get the local races to do the labour. In this way in Africa majority White occupation was never achieved, and only achieved in Australia with the virtual physical extermination of the Aborigine population.
<p>The American Indians were however either too proud or to weak to provide the wanted labour - and no sooner had the Whites established their society than they imported hundreds of thousands of Black slaves from Africa. After engaging in a civil war over whether these slaves should be freed or not, the American state declared these African slaves free and equal citizens -  and today virtually all major American cities are Black ghettos. A modern day visitor to America who only tours the big cities might well believe that America is a majority Black country.
<p>In South Africa, Black labour was used from the very beginning, and this economic entanglement contradicted Afrikaner attempts to enforce social segregation from the top down. The reliance on Black labour made it inevitable that the Whites in South Africa would lose power - it had happened in every other civilization which engaged in this practice.
<h3>EUROPEAN NATIONALISMS</h3>
<p>Modern European history has also been marked by competing nationalism - which has led to a number of murderous internecine wars. Pointless conflicts such as the Napoleonic wars, the religious wars, the First and Second World Wars -  these bloody and ultimately unnecessary wars lasted right up to the second half of the 20th century.
<p>By the end of the 19th century, the world had been effectively colonized by the White Race. On every virtually every continent the White master held sway - the British Empire stretched right round the globe, leading to the saying that the sun never set on the empire.
<p>America was booming - Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand were all firmly established as White ruled nations. It seemed as if nothing could go wrong.
<h3>ADVANCE</h3>
<p>Huge technological advances - inconceivable a hundred years ago - are now old hat. Going to the moon - it was done 25 years ago already! Computers? A modern 1995 BMW motor vehicle has more computing power on board than what the Apollo 11 rocket had in 1969! There seems to be no end to the wonders that the technological wizards of Europe and America can produce - with of course faithful duplication and mass production by the Chinese and Japanese!
<p>However, now as we approach the end of the 20th century, we see the all too familiar signs - the same signs which preceded the fall of the ancient White civilizations  - the reliance on alien labour and the mass immigration of racial foreigners into White heartlands. 
<p>The demographics of Europe and America are changing every year - getting darker.  
<p>In Germany the Turkish invasion of the 20 Century proceeds without check. Kreuzberg in Berlin, is now the second biggest Turkish city in the world outside of Istanbul! Brixton in London is almost as Black as Soweto. Black Swedish pop starts are at the top of the pop music charts in Europe. European territorial integrity has been broken.
<h3>PARALLELS</h3>
<p>It does not take a genius or a fortune teller to see the parallels. As the demographic face of the two White modern heartlands-  Europe and America - change, so does the nature of those civilizations. Population trends say that in 100 years America will have an absolute non White majority. Europe is not far behind this projection.
<p>This time however, unlike ancient Egypt, India or other civilizations, there are no new White barbarians ready to take up the reins of Western civilization. There are no new territories to be developed and opened up.
<p>If things proceed unchecked, it is not far fetched to say that the 21st century will see the final disappearance of the White Race from this globe. 40,000 years of this great epoch could be wiped out.
<p>Who will change it? Who will rescue the West? I do not know. All I can do is help to sound the clarion call, and hope that the call will not go unanswered.

<H1>White Nationalism FAQ</H1>

<H4>by Yggdrasil</H4>

<P><IMG SRC="images/celt.gif" HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=180 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<P><B>Q.</B> What is White Nationalism?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> The idea that Whites may need to create a separate nation
as a means of defending themselves.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Do White Nationalists feel they are superior to other races?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> No. The desire of White Nationalists to form their own nation
has nothing to do with superiority or inferiority.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Do White Nationalists seek to dominate other races?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> Not at all. In fact, formation of a White nation removes any
possibility of White dominance of other races, as well as the plausibility
of the accusation that Whites wish to dominate others.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Do White Nationalists seek to insulate themselves from competition
from other races?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> No. A separate White nation would establish a policy of free
trade with its new neighbors. Labor markets are global, and the formation
of a White nation would not protect Whites from economic competition.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Well if White Nationalists don't feel superior, don't want
to dominate others, and don't seek protection from competition, then why
would they want a separate nation?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> To avoid exploitation.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Exploitation? This is rich! So how is it that Whites are exploited?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> It is a long list. Burdensome racial preference schemes in
hiring, racial preference schemes in university admissions, racial preference
schemes in government contracting and small business loans. Beyond quotas
there is the denial of rights of free speech and of due process to Whites
who are critical of these governmental policies. We have special punishments
for assaults committed by Whites if the motives might be racial. In addition,
Whites pay a proportion of the costs of the welfare state that is disproportionate
to what they receive in benefits.</P>

<P>But the most exploitative aspect of the situation is that neither the
racial quotas, the business preferences, the loss of freedom of speech,
nor the disproportionate contributions to the welfare state have managed
to sate the appetites of non-Whites living in the United States.</P>

<P>The more Whites sacrifice, the more non-Whites demand. Many Whites are
beginning to believe that no amount of tribute, other than mass suicide,
would satisfy the non-White demands.</P>

<P>If our presence stirs up that much hatred in the hearts of non-Whites,
then the only sensible course of action is to separate ourselves from them.</P>

<P>Q. You claim that non-Whites are the aggressors and haters in race relations.
Aren't you afraid that most Whites will think this is ridiculous?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> Not in the slightest. For the past 30 years most Whites have
taken part in a mass migration or &quot;White flight&quot; away from neighborhoods
inhabited by non-Whites. Aggressors don't flee. For example, on a per-capita
basis, Blacks are 49 times more likely to assault a White than a White
is to assault a Black. Assaults by Whites against Blacks are approximately
40 times scarcer than they would be if races were randomly mixed and assault
rates did not vary by race. The best measure of racism is the number of
non-economically motivated attacks. White score low in this regard, non-Whites
high.</P>

<P>The fact is that non-Whites are clamoring to enter this country in droves.
Whites are fleeing en masse to formerly uninhabited areas to escape these
new arrivals.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> But how can Whites be exploited when it is Whites who have
enacted these racial preferences, the taxation, the welfare payments and
set immigration quotas?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> Excellent question! It is true that Whites are exploited by
their fellow Whites. In fact, we do not expect any resistance by non-Whites
to the formation of a separate nation. We expect White integrationist elites
to resist. They are the ones who have a great deal to lose.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> If life in America is so bad for Whites why don't you just
move back to Europe?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> We are a majority. We do not have to move back. We can resolve
to defend ourselves against this onslaught. We have the option of peacefully
ceding lands already inhabited by non-Whites to separate non-White nations.
We would save money, and could restore our civil liberties and free ourselves
from constant threats of violence by so doing.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> What would your separate state look like?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> The truth is we don't know yet. Our separate state would follow
the geographic outlines of White flight. The model for this state would
be the modern gerrymander created by the Voting Rights Act to create majority
non-White congressional districts. We would simply cede these to a separate
nation. The mechanics of this process will be explained more fully later
in a post entitled &quot;sweating the details.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Would all Whites be welcome in your separate state?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> Absolutely. There would be no restriction by country of origin,
and no genetic tests, skin color or hair color tests or any nonsense like
that. The only restriction would be that those who would wish to recreate
the present system by importing non-Whites and then encouraging their hostility
would not be welcome. They would have to remain in or move to the lands
ceded to the non-Whites.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Would Asians be welcome in your separate state?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> Absolutely. As a general rule, Asians show very little aggression
towards Whites, either personally or politically. Thus, there is no reason
to exclude them. There is no desire on the part of White Nationalists to
insulate themselves from competition from non-Whites who are already here,
and who get along well with us.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Would the same hold true for Hispanics.</P>

<P><B>A.</B> The census bureau classifies half of all Hispanics as White.
White Nationalists generally feel the same way. That portion of the Hispanic
population that blends in and displays no hostility of a personal or political
kind may remain. That group of Hispanics who want to see the Southwestern
U.S. annexed to Mexico would not be welcome.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> You are proposing that inclusion and exclusion be based on
ideology and feelings. Won't your act of nation splitting turn into a witch
hunt?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> For White liberals it is definitely going to feel like a witch
hunt! When the time comes, those who are guilty of &quot;integrationism&quot;
should do the sensible thing and flee. It will spare us all a lot of pain.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Is this White nation something that you intend to pursue right
away?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> No. The White nation is, by most accounts, about 20 years
off. When the rest of the U.S. begins to look like Southern California
it will happen more or less automatically, without much of a push from
us.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> Why do you use the term &quot;European-American?&quot;</P>

<P><B>A.</B> All Whites are descended from European immigrants, and we
are not actually &quot;White.&quot; The term European-American has political
significance for two reasons. First, it recognizes that most people in
the U.S. of European extraction have intermarried to such an extent that
it is no longer possible to identify American Whites as &quot;Irish&quot;
or &quot;German&quot; or &quot;Italian.&quot; But more important, use of
the term &quot;European-American&quot; is intended to recognize that White
elites in the United States have exploited differences based on religion
and European national origin to divide European-Americans, with the intention
of rendering us unable to defend ourselves against non-White demands.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> What is White separatism?</P>

<P>A White separatists will agree on most points with a White Nationalist,
except that he may not see a need to establish a separate nation within
the present territorial boundaries of the U.S.</P>

<P><B>Q.</B> What is a White supremacist?</P>

<P><B>A.</B> That is a White who wishes to subjugate other races by force,
ordinarily by military conquest. White supremacists are very rare in 1995,
and there is no visible trend or base of support which would allow them
to carry such a political program into effect.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Aryan Nations</B> is not a new right-wing organization
suddenly appearing on the scene. Aryan Nations is the on-going work of
Jesus the Christ regathering His people, calling His people to a state
for their nation to bring in His Kingdom! We hail His Victory!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> in the preservation of our Race, individually
and collectively, as a people as demanded and directed by Yahweh. We believe
our Racial Nation has a right and is under obligation to preserve itself
and its members.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that Adam, man of Genesis, is the placing
of the White Race upon this earth. Not all races descend from Adam. Adam
is the father of the White Race only. (Adam in the original Hebrew is translated:
&quot;to show blood in the face; turn rosy.&quot;) Genesis 5:1</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that the true, literal children of the
Bible are the twelve tribes of Israel, now scattered throughout the world
and now known as the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, Teutonic, Scandinavian, Celtic
peoples of the earth. We know that the Bible is written to the family of
Abraham, descending from Shem back to Adam. Yahweh blessed Abraham and
promised that he would be the &quot;father of nations.&quot; This same
promise continued through the seedline of Abraham's son Isaac, and again
to Isaac's son Jacob, the patriarch of the twelve tribes, whose name Yahweh
changed to Israel (Meaning: &quot;he will rule as God&quot;). Genesis 32:28;
Exodus 12:31; 16:4; 19:20; Revelations 21:12</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that there are literal children of Satan
in the world today. These children are the descendants of Cain, who was
a result of Eve's original sin, her physical seduction by Satan. We know
that because of this sin there is a battle and a natural enmity between
the children of Satan and the children of The Most High God (Yahweh). Genesis
3:15; 1 John 3:12</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that the Cananite Jew is the natural
enemy of our Aryan (White) Race. This is attested by scripture and all
secular history. The Jew is like a destroying virus that attacks our racial
body to destroy our Aryan culture and the purity of our Race. Those of
our Race who resist these attacks are called &quot;chosen and faithful.&quot;
John 8:44; 1 Thessalonians 2:15; Revelations 17:14</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that there is a battle being fought
this day between the children of darkness (today known as Jews) and the
children of light (Yahweh, The Everliving God), the Aryan Race, the true
Israel of the bible. Revelations 12:10-11</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> in the gam-ma'di'on (ga'ma'di-on), n.;
pl. -DIA (-a). [MGr., dim. of gamma.] A cross formed of four capital gammas
(I'), esp. in the figure of a swastika. Gamma among early Christians symbolized
Christ as a cornerstone of the church. WEBSTERS DICTIONARY.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that the present world problems are
a result of our disobedience to Divine Law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WE BELIEVE</B> that there is a day of reckoning. The
usurper will be thrown out by the terrible might of Yahweh's people, as
they return to their roots and their special destiny. We know there is
soon to be a day of judgment and a day when Christ's Kingdom (government)
will be established on earth, as it is in heaven. &quot;And in the days
of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never
be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it
shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand
forever. The saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
and all dominions shall serve and obey Him.&quot; Daniel 2:44; 7:18; 7:27</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WHITE RACISM:</B> Where does it come from?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What is the actual driving force behind the &quot;racist&quot;
White Christian Nationalist's fight for the preservation of the Aryan Race?
The news media would scream an immense and piercing shriek of &quot;HATE&quot;
if they could catch the slightest whisper of such a question coming from
ruddy Aryan lips. But those long standing warriors in this Struggle know
that the answer has a much greater depth and meaning than the anti-Christ
Jews, mongrel hordes and liberal White race-mixers could even begin to
fathom. . . that of LOVE.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The depths of Love are rooted and very deep in a real
White Nationalist's soul and spirit, no form of &quot;hate&quot; could
even begin to compare. At least not a hate motivated by ungrounded reasoning.
It is not hate that makes the average White man look upon a mixed racial
couple with a scowl on his face and loathing in his hear. It is not hate
that makes the White housewife throw down the daily jewspaper in repulsion
and anger after reading of yet another child-molester or rapist sentenced
by corrupt courts to a couple short years in prison or on parole. It is
not hate that makes the White workingman curse over his beer about the
latest boatload of mud-creatures dumped upon our shores to be given job
preference over the White citizens who build this land. It is not hate
that brings rage into the heart of a White Christian farmer when he reads
of billions loaned or given away as &quot;aid&quot; to foreigners when
he can't get the smallest break from an unmerciful government to save his
failing farm. No, it is not hate, IT'S LOVE.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>FOUNDATIONS</B> <B>BIOGRAPHY OF ARYAN NATIONS</B> Richard
G. Butler</FONT></P>

<P><IMG SRC="animages/an4.gif"  ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=+1>Who are we, and
who is Richard G. Butler? We are the continuing direct-line Church of Jesus
Christ Christian as originally founded by Dr. Wesley Swift of Lancaster,
California. After Dr. Swift's death, the church has been carried on by
Richard G. Butler.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr. Butler received his formal education and training
in southern California, including Aeronautical Engineering at Los Angeles
City College. His early experience in the aircraft industry included management
of maintenance assembly and repair of major assemblies for commercial and
military aircraft in the United States, Africa and India.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1946, and the following 18 years, he organized and
operated a machine plant for the production and precision machining of
automotive parts and engine assemblies and aircraft parts. Subsequently
from 1964 through 1973, Mr. Butler was a marketing analyst for new inventions.
In 1968 he became a Senior Manufacturing Engineer for Lockheed Aircraft
Co. at their Palmdale, California, plant, where extensive development was
under way for the L-1011 aircraft. He resigned from this corporate associateship
to devote full energy and time to his greatest and all-consuming desire
to serve God and Nation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Pastor Butler is a co-inventor for rapid repair of tubeless
tires and holds both U.S. and Canadian patents thereon. He is a pilot and
during World War II was among other duties, a Flight Engineer Instructor
in the U.S. Air Force. His background reflects a broad experience in the
United States and foreign countries concerning alien races, their work
habits, status of &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;religions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Returning home from wartime activities in 1946, Mr. Butler
was deeply troubled concerning the future of his nation from what he had
observed first hand overseas and events resulting from governmental edicts
that seemed to be always contrary to the best interest of the nation, and
of the White Race, in particular. While active in business life, the closest
thing to his heart was the future of his nation; therefore, most all available
spare time was spent studying and delving into various service and political
organizations, trying to arouse attention of friends, acquaintances, members
of fraternal organizations, and business associates into action concerning
the threat of Jewish communism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The media publicity received from these efforts, while
nearly disastrous to business and professional life, turned out to be the
greatest of all blessings, in that he was let to Kingdom Identity with
the meeting and forming of the closest, most rewarding of all personal
relationships with Dr. Wesley A. Swift, starting in 1961 and continuing
until Dr. Swift's passing in 1971.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The years of study were spent under Dr. Swift in his magnificent
library with line upon line, precept upon precept, and revelations over
the years from Dr. Swift and Rev. Bertrand Comparet. They shared the blows
of the enemy from their combined efforts in the Christian Defense League,
of which Pastor Butler was the National Director from 1962 to 1965.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Upon the passing of Dr. Swift, Mr. Butler continued holding
services for the congregation of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian,
until he moved to northern Idaho to expand the Kingdom Identity program
and to form the foundation for a &quot;Call to the Nation&quot; or Aryan
Nations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We seek to let every Aryan son and daughter of Yahweh
know what their duty is to the Covenent (Constitution) that Yahweh their
God has made with them as Nations of His people and His blessings come
to, or are withheld from, a Nation--so is it that each citizen of the Nation
is either blessed or cursed. The rewards are in direct proportion to the
ACTION and WILL of the Nation, for our people have the &quot;Law written
on their hearts.&quot; We seek to live and establish a government under
the Law of God, for Your Race is your Nation.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>FIDELITY</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>That for which we fight is to safeguard the existence
and reproduction of our Race, by and of our Nations, the sustenance of
our children and the purity of our blood, the freedom and independence
of the people of our Race, so that we, kindred people, may mature for fulfillment
of the mission allotted to us by the Creator of the universe, our Father
and God. Hail His Victory!</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Stormfront was the first White Nationalist site on the Web, going online
in March 1995. It was followed shortly by Reuben Logsdon's &quot;Cyberhate.&quot;
This precipitated an organized hate campaign by the Simon Wiesenthal Center
and similar groups to pressure our providers into yanking our accounts.
Since then, despite the best efforts of Rabbi Cooper and Company to censor
&quot;objectionable&quot; ideas, dozens of new sites have appeared. It's
becoming difficult for me to keep up with all of them, but I'll try to
keep this list updated with the most substantial of the new entries, along
with any URL changes for the old ones. </P>

<P>Please don't ask me to link sites at BHI's <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com">Geocities</A>.
This company offers free web pages, but it's adopted a policy of censoring
pro-White pages as soon as it finds them. Listing them here would only
hasten that process. <A HREF="http://www.aol.com">America Online</A> also
falls into this category.</P>

<DD>Pat Buchanan is a traditional populist conservative whose views frequently
coincide with those of White Nationalists. He was outspokenly opposed to
affirmative action and other anti-White programs long before it was fashionable
to do so. He called Capitol Hill &quot;Israeli-occupied territory.&quot;
He unflinchingly defended John Demjanjuk, the retired Cleveland auto worker
extradited to Israel for &quot;Nazi war crimes,&quot; and he was later
vindicated when the Israeli Supreme Court was forced to release Demjanjuk
in the face of new evidence released after the fall of the USSR. Though
he apparently does not understand the central importance of Race, his campaign
attracted some good people. This site, formerly the Buchanan for President
page, is now run by Linda Muller as a private project.</DD>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These newsgroups are unmoderated and have a very high noise level. Some
of the shrillest &quot;anti-racists&quot; feel completely safe spewing
their vitriol from behind a computer terminal, so be prepared if you've
never visited the usenet world. After a while, you may find aggressive
use of the &quot;kill files&quot; feature found on most newsreaders will
make these forums more readable. You might also want to subscribe to the

<h3><i>The Zundelsite is up and running!</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sun Aug 27 20:43 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>This is to thank Stormfront for putting up the URL for Zundelsite. For convenience's sake, I am listing it again.  It is <a TARGET="_top" href="http://www.webcom.com/~ezundel/english/">http://www.webcom.com/~ezundel/english/</a>.  We are asking other individuals or groups involved in this movement to help us advertise it and use it to the fullest, because, as we all know, ZOG will try to shut it down.  By the way, we should use the term ZOG as much as possible, because it is an identifier and helps condense and summarize what this is all about.

<p>Keep up the good work, Don.

<h3><i>White Culture?</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sat Aug 26 15:54 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I support your right to say what you like, but I question the logic
in some of your motives.  You say you celebrate white culture, and most
essayists here seem to be of the opinion that this white culture could
be destroyed by interracial breeding.  However: What do you consider
to be white culture?

<p>Whites in both the US and canada consist of those of British,
German, Irish, French, and other descents.  Those places have cultures
that should be celebrated.  Culture is not race based.

<p>The only culture that I could see as being in any sort of jeapordy
is that of the Germans.  (To some degree.)  It has gotten to the point
in Germany where waving a flag could get you labeled as a Nazi.  But in
the Americas, I don't see any such problem.

<h3><i>Stand up and be counted</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sat Aug 26 11:03 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I'm writing this letter wondering where and when a person could attend 
a meeting with other people of this interest. Other groups in this country
have conventions, why not us? The problem with most people is that they 
don't want anyone really to know about how they feel or think. Damnit man
we still have freedom of speech and the right to assembly the last time I looked.
Come on join in, don't be ashamed the blacks have got NAACP and proud of it.
Let's hear more a organization. Post here.

<h3><i>Identity Archaeology & Raymond Capt</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Aug 25 18:55 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>The Behistun Rock inscriptuion, and other stuff that is usually
cited to support Identity, is discussed by E. Raymond Capt in
MISSING LINKS or some such title, incl. refs. in title to
Assyrian records. I don't have it in front of me.

<p>Anyway, two points:

<p>(1) Capt never establishes that Khumri (for real Israel no 
question by authorities or anyone) and Kymry (Cimmerians) are 
the same, merely that they are simnilar enough sounding they
COULD be the same. A lot of peoples were dumped into the zone
between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea and many were already 
there. Function: dumppes were to be buffers against those 
already there, for the Assyrians. There are radical changes
in language, order of words, physical culture, etc. to be made
in a scant 200 years if Identity is true. 

<p>To assimilate into the background peoples there, and to be 
their origin, are not the same things.

<p>(2) In Ezra and Nehemiah, lists of Judahite returnees are 
given, which are short by 11,000+ of the total figure of 
returnees given, which was specified as not including servants,
so that doesn't explain it. Also sacrifices were made for "all
Israel," a term used several times. NT mentions Anna of the
tribe of Asher present in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus'
birth. It is thought that the Israelite tribes' members who
were still interested in God were the extra ones.

<p>As for blood, remember John the Baptist condemned those who
counted on their physical descent to make them count, saying
that if God chose He could raise up sons of Abraham from the
stones.

<h3><i>Aryan Singles page</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Aug 25 02:50 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>Excellent idea by the previous writer. An Aryan singles column. I tried to write a letter on that subject and submit it a month ago but I guess it didn't get through. This web site is great. Makes us feel so not alone. I could possibly get the page started with the assistance of Mr. Black. Please E-mail me Don and tell me how we do this. Were are all the girls and women of Euro decent? If your a female and you have some friends who would be interested in participating in this page please E-mail and I'll set up some guidelines(with Don's permission of course) And to all you Aryan men, show these Women why white men are the best, be honest and noble.

<h3><i>Vit Makt!!</i></h3>

<p><tt>Thu Aug 24 17:10 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I just returned to university from my summer vacation, only to find that, in order to get into the Net, I had to enter my name and the last four digits of my social security number. This applies to everyone who wants to use the computers. I asked the lab assistant, and she said that it's basically been done to monitor who uses what and who does what. 

<p>Not that I care if the university knows about my extra-curricular activities (I'm sure they do anyhow), but the very idea that they could monitor my activities on a day-to-day basis is intolerable. Of course, this type of tactic only makes me stronger. Now I understand how my brothers and sisters in more oppressive countries feel (as if there is any country more oppressive than the Jew.S.A). 

<p>My final thought: Don't let ZOG get you down. Stay strong and keep up the fight, for tomorrow does belong to us!

<p>Hi, this is AryanGar (Freya Yew) @aol.com.  Please tell Don that my name/link
is incorrect on the letters section.  I have been evidently getting many
contacts but they have been going by way of dead letter.  You have me down as
yew@aol.com, it should be Freya yew@aol.com but use my better known please,
AryanGar@aol.com.  Thank you very much for this change, i understand it is a
pain but i am establishing a National Alliance members on line directory &
they have been finding me via this link & not getting a response from me.  I
just recieved a letter from someone who has been hit with questions about my
link.  Thanks again for your time & effort :).  I shall share with you one of
my many poems in hopes it cures the pain in the as this letter might cause.
(you have my permission to print this poem in on your page or a publication,
E-mail me first though please).

<h3><i>ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION: WHAT IS RACE?</i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Aug 22 20:31 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>As a civilized society, we havent examined this question as objectively
as we should. Honest research and study in this field is needed without
the usual prejudice of some at the expense of others. "The Bell Curve"
comes to mind when I say this.

<p>Researchers, specialists, anthropologists, ethnologist, and every
other 'ologist claims that the oldest man/woman, human remains to
be found to substantiate (any) knowledge of the human race has been found
on the continent of AFRICA. That means, ADAM & EVE were of the African
race or whatever name they called themselves at that time, never-
the-less, they were of the Black family/race.

<p>This means that the remaining "human race" of men and women from Brown 
to White stems and therefore wouldn't even EXIST---if it wasn't for the Black
family/race. The logic is very simple, there was one man, one woman created
in the beginning. To this very day, there is no other evidence of any
other human fossil that has been found to deny this fact. From that 
man and woman sprang the rest of civilization, i.e. that including YOU
who are reading this now.

<p>So what does all this mean? It means that our so-called 'civilized' society isnt
as civilized as it claims. How could it be civilized when it despises the Black race for
no good reason at all other than the fact that Black humans suffered for white peoples
benefits.  What kind of logical explanation can a sane and intelligent White Nationalist 
or any other give to humankind to justify this ill behavior? I use the word despise 
understanding that in isolated incidences this word may be too harsh, but in other 
cases and the overwhelming majority of cases...Africans or Black people have been despised!

<p>The Black race is the same race of people who established the arts of civilization from religion, 
science, philosophy, astronomy, and even the calendar.  This fact may be hard for most people to 
believe since the masses have been deceived into believing otherwise, but all one has to do 
is research this information for yourself. 

<p>The Egyptians who once resided on the Northern tip of AFRICA learned how to build
highly complex and sophisticated temples including the grand structure, The Great Pyramid
by King Khufu. I often wonder why the founding fathers of this country used the
very structure (Pyramid) that Black people built and placed it on the back side of 
the dollar bill.

<p>I dont want to ponder too much on Africans contributions to the WORLD in particular
but I wanted to bring up these truths for those of you out there hating what you dont
quite understand. My question and extreme concern again is how a so-called 'civilized'
society can blame the very race it brought up in this society? How else did Africans/Black
people learn anything after being freed from slavery? Europeans in this country taught
Black people the very traits that are complained about today! Europeans created the
many vices that we encounter today and Black people are always to blame. If a White person
provided me with drugs after going to Columbia to get it...then this person is the real blame! 
Making drugs available for the Black community is the cause of their bad habit(s) and only 
the devil would cause temptation to human beings, get my drift.

I close only to say that I wonder about people who hate. It makes very little sense and if you can
educate me as to why this is...Im open ears. I only know that in order to love another, you must
be able to love yourself...COMMON KNOWLEDGE AND TRUE WISDOM.

Please print this letter but leave my e-mail address off.

Thank you,

<h3><i>Interesting yet lacking facts</i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Aug 22 17:37 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I have read your information and I have read some of the letters.  
I agree that if you feel that
your rights and / or freedoms are violated that you should stand
up for them.  One thing that I do not agree with is the constant belief
that "Other Races" are out to destroy you.  To be totally honest, it is
"white" race that is always worried about what other groups think of them
and always have the constant xenophobic reaction to other races being in a 
superior position to them.  This is caused by generations of invaisions into the poorly
defended Slavic and European kingdoms.  Ignorance and fear have fed to
the misinformation that is so prevelant in many publications such as
this one.  I would appreciate that you cut the rheoteric and other 
literary "fat" and put some facts that can be empirically "backed up"

<p>Good luck and keep it up.

<h3><i>First time internet user</i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Aug 22 16:36 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>This is my first time on Internet. I enjoyed reading the letters.

<p>I and most people I meet are (German Kelt) Aryans. Why are Aryans so prejudiced and narrow-minded? Have Aryans been mis-educated and brain-poisoned (Are Aryans so suicidal because they hate themselves?) by the Jewish owned/controlled mass media (according to my concept "media" includes schools and religious organizations, etc.)? Has anyone ever heard the media say anything good about Aryans or any criticism of the Jews who own it? The Jewish agenda includes inciting hatred between Aryans and other races, so Jews expose some Negro crimes so Aryans hate and focus blame on Negroes (who are powerless pawns) instead of on Jews. When Jews blame Aryans for Negro criminality they fulfill the Jewish agenda (devide and conquer?) in many ways at the same time, such as villification of Aryans who Jews say are hate-filled racists who cause Negro crime by unfairly impoverishing the Negro race. Jews want Aryans to believe that Negro genes are in no way responsible for the Negro crime rate being (!) en times that of Aryans, so the Negro can be glorified and miscegenation encouraged. 

<p>How alive or happy can anyone be without pride? Lack of pride is the Aryan's most commonplace mental disease (Christianity claims lack of pride is a virtue). Does the media always do whatever it can (lie, etc.) to glorify American minorities (Negroes, Latin Americans, Jews) and their cultures, etc., but only villifies Aryans? Will we spend eternity in Hell as punishment for being "born in sin" unless we worship a God/Jew quoted in the Bible, in Matthew 15: "I was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel and to them alone. It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs." (I use "The New English Bible" translation.) According to Deuternomy 7, etc., the Hebrew God (imposed on our Aryan ancestors by savage force) chose the Jews to be "above all people that are upon the face of the earth" and told Jews to drive us out of our land and to exterminate us without mercy. "God will put Aryan kings (governments) in the hands of Jews and wipe out the Aryan name/identity from under heaven (Deuteronomy 7.24). How can people without a government or identity defend themselves? The Torah has helped Jews to cherish and preserve Jewish identity for thousands of years. Ezra 9.12 tells Jews never to marry or seek the welfare or prosperity of non-Jews. Jews are unashamed (Jews got chutzpah!) of their racist religion, which is magnitudes more savage than anything Jews ever alleged Aryans to have done (2 Chronicles 8.7, for example). Yet Aryans are even afraid to say the word "Aryan", and hardly know what Aryan means.

<p>An Aryan is a person of Indo-Hittite (Indo-European) ancestry. Germans, Kelts, Slavs (Russians), Kurds, Persians (Iran = Aryan), India Aryans, etc. are more or less pure Aryans. Not all "Whites" are Aryans. Semites (Jews and Arabs), Basques, Caucasians, and southern Europeans, etc. are part of a race which about 35,000 years ago emigrated from Africa to Eurasia, where they miscegenated with or exterminated the Neaderthals, before the Ice Ages. Glaciers cleansed northern Europe by pushing people south, which is why the pre-Aryans of Europe are referred to as the Mediterranean race, and why the Aryan race of Northern Europe (the origin of most "white" Americans) has remain pure enough to maintain the most powerful Aryan civilization. The ancient Aryan civilizations in the Middle East and southern Europe, once the most powerful in the world, have declined due to miscegenation with Mediteraneans.

<p>Aryan civilization was the first on Earth (in Canaan 12,000 years ago), and has led the world in science and technology ever since. According to the "History and Geography of Human Genes" (1994), Aryans (Indo-Hittites) entered Europe from the Fertile Crescent, and the Bible refers to Aryans as Hittites who are part of the Hamite (Canaanite) race, which entered Europe from the Sahara because of drought in the Sahel. The human animal is as savage as any other and also requires domestication (breeding out dangerous behaviors necessary to survival in a savage environment/society) before civilization can exist. Some races have not yet been domesticated.

<p>Would miscegenation be distroying the Aryan race if Aryan education began with a knowledge of Aryan racial identity, history, civilization, etc? Will life ever have access to the infinite resources beyond earth if the potential of Aryan civilization is not maximized by as pure an Aryan race as possible?

<p>I write this in the hope some of you who are reading this are fighters who will help to educate others about the need to preserve Aryan race/civilization and the science and technology which gives life the potential to colonize the Universe beyond this finite planet.

<p>Thanks for the time you have taken to read this.

<p>I am a twenty four year old white male in a time and place where it is not popular to be such. I was quite impressed with your page and the message that you put out on the net. I am often stunned at the way people have abandond their race to try and adopt another one.  am not a racist.  have respect for any man who is willing to work raise a family and be an assest to his community, but it upsets me to see that this country of mine has turned into nation of whiners. If one person can see though the bull that the goverment puts forth and see the racism that others have towards whites (even our oown race hates itself) then your efforts are not in vain. Great job!!!!!!!!!!

<p>I've been on the net a week and I was stunned and horrified to stumble on 
this page.  Homage to the Waffen SS?  Denouncements of miscegenation?
I am a white, southern, American whose great uncle was a general in the
civil war.  But even coming from this background, I cannot understand
the blatant hatred displayed on this web page.  You ask why minorities
are always crying about racism?  This is why! You are why! And I will
tell you that if you try to gain power as a political party there 
are millions of white Americans who will stand up against you and 
strive to put your hatemongering away.
 
<p>You who are denouncing black people-how many have you known?  You who
say that the liberals are hiding the facts about genetic differences
between the races, know this.  The genetic difference between a random
white person and a random black person is no greater than that between
two white people.  Your time is over.  Your hatred will be defeated.

<h3><i>SLAVERY AND THE MYTH</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Aug 18 20:09 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>There is a serious misconception about Slavery and what occurred in 
Africa. First off, Blacks did not (sell themselves) into slavery...
what idiot would believe this garbage? Question: If you were an African
King/Chief, as there was, and you were told to either sell your tribe 
(people/community) into slavery or be enslaved yourself along with your
family...what would you have done? Blacks in Africa would have never 
sold their brethren if whites and other conquerors didnt have superior
weapons? Unfortunately, whites in those times werent courageous enough
to fight WITHOUT these weapons. To be honest, Africans really had no 
other choice with a gun in their face! Other than that, slavery was 
for those who were either captives of war or criminals and even then,
it wasnt BONDAGE slavery. There are no written records to date concerning
the slavery of any human beings treated as Africans have been treated 
here in America! The slaves mentioned in the Bible were treated better 
than Black slaves in America, at least they didnt get lynched or 
castrated! 

<p>Granted, White Americans of today were not there and did not enslave 
anyone, however, whites of TODAY are benefiting from and are the heirs 
of what AFRICAN-AMERICANS ancestors worked (through slavery) for 350 
years UN-PAID. Blacks are not whining about anything, we simply want 
what was rightfully EARNED. Whites of today just want the usual 
advantages of simply being white and all the things that go along 
with it. We could care less about being white, we want what OUR 
ancestors have EARNED. The white plantation owners sat around and 
watched and made sure the work was done, sure, but it was the Black 
people who actually did the hard work in building this country.  
Where is all the money now...IN OUR GOVERNMENT. So when you think we 
are whining, understand, we not only have a right but it is our duty 
because our ancestors were promised certain things from all this and 
received NOTHING!

<p>I am writing on this because of the response Stormfront received from 
a Connie in Texas who made some vague, yet childish comments.  I didnt 
see anywhere in the letter that I originally wrote that said Connie 
enslaved me. Connie makes silly statements like her being enslaved 
to constant whining and outrages, she meant outrageous Im sure, 
demands from your NAACP. Connie, I dont own the NAACP! Yes, I do have 
balls to gripe but dont put words where they dont belong! You may 
be tired of hearing about Slavery but dont think that we will ever 
forget this atrocity! Question: Are you also tired of  Shindlers List 
by chance?

<p>About the STATISTICS that Mr. Truth wrote about. Understand that 
statistics add up to numbers on paper and has very little to do with 
reality! For instance, you mentioned The Bell Curve which illustrates 
the competence and intelligence of certain races from what I gather. 
If I was to believe this garbage, how would one explain how Africans 
built Pyramids in Africa-Egypt and also how would one explain the 
numerous accomplishments of Africans here in America? You see, statistics 
are numbers and those numbers do not account for the many others 
outside of that perimeter.  Sure, alot of Black people are on welfare, 
but so are alot of whites. Sure, alot of Black people commit crimes, 
but what do you call people like DAHMER, FURHMAN, or PACKWOOD for that 
matter? Saints!  STATISTICS generalize and so do idiots!

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Truth stated that Blacks are dead weight over the 
shoulders of each REGULAR-American. I would like to know from Mr.Truth 
what the hell is a REGULAR-American? IF your answer is white then 
you are exactly what I perceived you to be from the beginning...you 
figure it out! Oh, and if you think that the country would be better 
off without Blacks, you may be right! I Just wish your ancestors would 
have thought about that long before they decided to bring us here!!!!!

<h3><i>Celebrating white heritage</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Aug 18 16:08 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>John Smith wants to know:

<p>"SO WHY IS IT THAT WHEN WHITE PEOPLE CELEBRATE THEIR HERITAGE THIS IS LOOKED UPON AS A DISGUSTING "HATE" ACTIVITY???"

<p>That's a good question John.  I think that the answer is that these "celebrations" too often denigrate into things like this:
<p>"To update you a little on the slavery in america. "blacks" sold themselves into slavery!!" (as if whites have never done that)

<p>"the game DOOM is well suited towards our interests. Despite the obvious fantasy elements of the game, it nonetheless reinforces marksmanship, conservation of ammunition and the proper use of cover." (have White-rights activists given up on democracy?  What do you propose to replace it with?)

<p>"the need to pay proper tribute the millions of brave European men and women who fought bravely with the Waffen-SS." (and here I thought the Nazi's were megalomaniacal bastards who killed millions of fellow white people)

<p>If you truly want to be able to state aloud that you are a proud, white, male, you must work to distance yourself, and your fellow proud, white, males from hate-mongers, revisionists and alias-wielding cowards.  The fact that your message is on the same page as these hateful tracts shows why people cannot help but associate them in their minds.

<p>I will be surprised if this gets posted, because Stormfront makes no distinction between white-rights activists and racists.  They would be unlikely to want to broadcast that fact.

<p>Reject hate, scorn haters and be proud of who you are.

<p>1: Congratulations on a well-executed website!

<p>2: Reference the posting Sat 08 JUL 1995 by DECADER, Richmond VA USA
   he might also be interested in the "Deguello" operations against
   wp leaders in the '70's. Frankly, these too sophisticated and 
   effective to have come from "outsider" cointelpro terrorists but
   were far more likely to have come from those who were in sympathy
   with many of our long-range goals. There's probably a place for
   some commentary and history about this as you get some of the
   archives set up, and it's part of the history of <*OUR*> movement!
   I can't think of a better place for the story to be told, and
   retold.

<p>3: Reference "John Doe #2"- now that FBI sniper Lon (women & children
   first) Horiuchi will be forced to appear as a witness at the
   congressional hearings on the Ruby Ridge murders, it'll be 
   interesting to see a profile photo of him side-by-side with the 
   "John Doe #2" sketch, which is no longer available at the FBI 
   website. Watch for him on C-Span!

<p>4: For an interesting website containing reports of Israeli Jews 
   killing 34 Americans and the resulting coverup, see:

<h3><i>Inclusion</i></h3>

<p><tt>Thu Aug 17 13:47 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I think that most of the posts to this website are reflective of the
dissatisfaction of the white people having felt duped by the people
that have tried to further the cause of the disadvantaged in America.
In this regard, when those in policy making positions decided what
was needed to protect the less fortunate they designed programs that
took away from one group perceived privaleges and afforded another
group preferential treatment over and above those of the other. This
has led to divisive nature of politics today. This cannot be construed
as an inprovement of the situation. If policy are exclusive of any one
group then a tremendous amount of animosity is generated.

<p>I don't anyone can identify my race from the text or tenor of this post
unless I specifically choose to profess it. That brings me to my point.
If anyone wants to make inroads in fighting for their rights let them
do so with the goal of including all people into their attempts to make
the world a better place.

<h3><i>A divided front?</i></h3>

<p><tt>Aug 13 02:17 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>Reading your pages, it becomes clear to me how thoroughly divided your "movement" is.  I would encourage all of your readers to go through each of the documents on this site and the associated ones, and mark down each statement you disagree with.  At the end you will find that that there are more differences than commonalties.

<p>Pride or hatred?

<p>On the one hand, you claim that all you stand for is white pride and unity.  Pride and unity of any sort are good.

<p>On the other hand, you direct people to web pages called "cyberhate." Skulls play a prominent place in your (collective) imagery.  You seem to embrace hate in your "quote of the day."  You promote records called "Born to hate."  You are glad that Orientals and blacks are fighting at UC.  

<p>Which is it?  Are you dedicated to unity and love or division and hatred?  

<p>Superior or not?

<p>On the one hand, the "White Nationalism FAQ" says "Do White Nationalists do feel that they are superior to other races?  No."  But another piece on the site says: "On the way back to my room I wondered if, in a few hundred years, some half-Black ancestor of mine would be sitting among the ruins of our civilization, brushing away the flies, waiting to die."  Which is it?  Are blacks our genetic ruination or are they different but equal?

<p>Nazi symbolism or Christian?

<p>You have this gothic-Christian cross-like logo on your front page, but nazi logos buried in subpages.

<p>In [1], the author says: "In the United States, we are taught that racial integration is a moral imperative."  Perhaps it has to do with that "we take these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal"

<p>Anti-British?

<p>In [2] there is a pile of anti-British propaganda.  I wonder what your readers of British ancestry think of that? 

<p>What is a "White?"

<p>All over the place on your site Jews are derided, but David Duke promotes ancient Indians as Aryans???

<p>Waco by the government or for the government?

<p>Some [3] of your writings about Waco say that it was "citizens striking back against the government."  Others [4] say that it was the government that did it.

<p>Christianity or Paganism?

<p>The people at [5] are clearly not Christians.  They laugh at those who: "postulate a divine but nevertheless manlike being who rules man and the world by supernatural law"  That sounds like the Christian God to me.  They sound more like Pagans or Buddhists in their belief in "one reality, which we call Nature"

<p>Barry Manilow, rules or sucks?

<p>At [6] a man denigrates Barry Manilow as an example of the evil infesting our society, but Mr. Cyberhate runs a Barry Manilow home page!

<p>Conclusion:

<p>It is clear that there is no unity or commonality of your beliefs.  You are united only by that most destructive of emotions, fear.  Your hatred is just a result of your fear, of course.  Most hatred is.  Like the obsolete macho men you are (women are obviously underrepresented in the movement), you put on a gruff, tough exterior to hide your fear of that which you do not know or understand (particularly the future).  If you ever got an opportunity to create your own country it would quickly collapse under the weight of your differences (and your penchant for military resolution of social problems).  

<p>Luckily racism (or racialism if you're a politically correct racist) has been on the decline since the beginning of the age of reason so your page stands out as a fantastic anthropological specimen of a dying belief system.  Keep up the good work!

<p>To update you a little on the slavery in america.  
"blacks" sold themselves into slavery!!
We did not rip them from their homeland, they where not even wanted 
by their own people!  If your black, personaly, im tired of 
hearing you whine about slavery, because I WAS NOT HERE!,i didnt
have a damn thing to do with it, neither did my family, we didnt
arive until after the civil war, but you still have the balls to
gripe to me that "I" enslaved you!  I am the one enslaved to your 
constant whining and the outrages demands from your NAACP.

<p>If you are white, sir , take off your blinders,  be aware of 
the world around you, dont just hide your head in books, but go out and 
live life,  maybe then you will experience what we are talking about, 
maybe then you will get a taste of the racism that is against you!

<h3><i>FIGHT, FIGHT, YOU MIGHTY WHITE!</i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Aug  8 09:59 EDT 1995</tt>

<P>Hi there!

<p>I am very pleased to see that Im not alone to fight for my race.
Currently, I live in Sweden, which soon is bound to be a place where 
the Whites are a minority (if nothing is done soon). Ghettos ascending from nowhere like
mushrooms, filled with non-whites. The estimated number of immigrants is now 18% and rising, 
and by year 2000, we are outnumbered. Our hope right now is to get organized, and seize the power.

<P>KEEP FIGHTING FELLOW WHITES, OR WE WILL FACE EXTINCTION!!!!!!!!!

<p>Although electronic gaming should in no way displace the Aryan's exercise of mind, body and learning; should one be inclined towards electronic gaming, the game DOOM is well suited towards our interests. Despite the obvious fantasy elements of the game, it nonetheless reinforces marksmanship, conservation of ammunition and the proper use of cover. All of these principles are very important in real life as well. This game can be networked, so that several players can hunt each other as well. All in all, a game that does well to teach partisan/militia tactics.

<h3><i>Multiculturalism</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sat Aug  5 21:18 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I think the current state of the country is very depressing.  
Multiculuralism is being taught just about every where and a city in
New York is trying to legalize homosexual marriages.  Meanwhile just
about every pro-white organization is too busy gossiping and back-
stabbing to do anything about it.  The way things are I wouldn't join
any organization, that really sickens me.  All white people need to 
band together or our children have no future.

<p>The Frenchman , Voltaire, said, "I do not agree with what you say
but I would give my life to defend it."  I agree with this, but if I see a
a lie, or just a mistake, I try to correct it. The mistakes of which I speak
are mannt... I shall just mention a few. Peanutbutter,gasmasks,trains, medical
contributions, were all made by the same people you seem so against. Lets just 
everything gets pushed to far, and a race war occurs... without the things I 
mentioned, all sides would suffer more then they would need to. Whats my point? 
just this, they did the things in the advancement of ALL of society, not just 
for themselves. Your fathers may have been saved due to a gasmask, or survied
on peanutbutter, or been evacuated, by things a "minority" created. Dig deeper 
into our history, you will find even grater trueths then you imagined.

<h3><i>WHY IS IT ? </i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Aug  1 16:24 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>The very concept of Multiculturalism is that every heritage group 
should be proud of their relative background.
We in Canada encourage the different groups to promote and 
rejoice in their respective heritage. 

<p>SO WHY IS IT THAT WHEN WHITE PEOPLE CELEBRATE THEIR 
HERITAGE THIS IS LOOKED UPON AS A DISGUSTING "HATE" ACTIVITY ???

<p>I believe that because whites are viewed by our governments as 
a silent majority, then they don't need to worry about our 
support, instead they feel that they had better coddle up to the 
visible minority special interest groups for votes.  
Its about time that the whites stood up for their own interests, as
do the visible minority groups.   Thats equality!  It doesn't
look like our governments are going to stand up for us, so lets do it
ourselves.

<p>Our government here in Canada does not help this situation, and 
actually makes the situation worse by ill-conceived policies.
Can you believe that here in Ontario, the provincial government 
actually publishes job postings in the newpaper 
which read "women, visible minorities and handicapped people are 
encouraged to apply".

<p>Why didn't they just say "white males need not apply."

<p>Its about time that whites in North America should not feel 
ashamed about beating our own drum and being proud of our heritage.
We represent one of the most successful races on earth.  Just look 
at the state of many of the visible minority nations.
Then look at the white nations.  That comparison should
tell you right there that we whites have a lot to be proud of.

<p>This does not mean that we should be against anyone because of 
colour or ethnic background for that reason alone, but we should 
not be afraid to promote our own racial heritage, that of the whites
from around the world.

<p>We have remained silent long enough.

<h3><i>Be Proud of Your History</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sat Jul 22 16:24 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>Great page design! 

<p>Though not a "socialist," I'm a nationalist who is angry at affirmative action, "multiculturalism," "diversity," and all the other anti-white code words and programs.

<p>Where do they come from? From a single root cause: the belief that "minorities" have been oppressed and harmed by whites, or the "white male system" otherwise known as Western Civilization.

<p>Let's get it right: minorities have it infinitely better in this country than they could ever have hoped for if their ancestors had never come into contact with Europeans. Despite media propaganda, the aborigines who populated this continent before the white man came were not beautiful creatures who lived in harmony with nature; they were illiterate savages who had to kill or be killed. They lived short hard lives of grinding poverty and ignorance. Even the descendants of those who were brought here as slaves are all far better off than they could
have hoped for if they had stayed where they were.

<p>Ever notice how those who hate Western Civilization the most are the first in line for the special favors and handouts so they can live in the white man's modern high-tech world? Funny thing, but I haven't seen any of them actually return to the primitive lifestyle of the ancestors they admire so much. 

<p>Time to get it right: The "oppressor" has given more and taken less than the "oppressed." Maybe its time we stopped getting treated as second class citizens and got a loud THANK-YOU!

<p>Hello. After many years of fighting to see to have a trully equal voice in public,it is
 indeed wonderful to see a web page such as this one. I fought most of my short 
30 years of my life against the lies of Multi-culturalism and affimative action, just as 
I thought all hope was lost for this country I am witnessing for the first time other 
individuals who are like minded take up the clarion call to action to preserve our 
future and way of life. 

<p>By the way, when will your graphic section be made availible? I look forward to that...
 I find it "Odd" that I can find the "Marxist Manifesto" "Das Kapital" everywhere on the the net, 
but not "Mien Kampf." Why is that?																														"14 Words!"

<p>I've just started cruising the Web Sites and find yours to be one of the best. Americans of European ancestry are responsible for all the comforts and conveniences we have today. Our forefathers fought, sweated, and suffered in the past so that their children could have it a little easier. Now we see the result: the vast majority of White Americans are so wrapped up in themselves and in trying to be fashionable that they don't even know what we are sprinting towards: our doom. With the help of your website and others, we can achieve Racial Solidarity and establish an Aryan Republic representative of its vast majority of those of European ancestry. Race is everything!

<p>As an supporter of the White race, ex-government employee with one of

I would like to commend those who are honestly in the frontlines to

this movement, with one goal in mind, and that is to destroy the White
race. 
<p>If, we were indeed performing some acts of terrorism, then fine, but
the simple fact is that there are those whom are seeking World Conquest,
and they can only accomplish it by 1) Disarming the Nation, 2) Taking
away the Rights of those from the Nation, and 3) Destroying the people
from that Nation.  There are 2 "foes" targeted, and that is the White
race and the Christian religion.

<h3><i>Building Blocks</i></h3>

<p><tt>Tue Jul 18 14:22 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I don't believe that their exists racism amongst white people anymore.  Instead I believe it is a form of realism.  Americans, since the beginning of their educational upbringing, are taught first with blocks, and then on to letter combinations, to build structure from pieces collected.  As we grow older, the lesson of building relevant creations continues and flourishes.  The same exists in relation to members of the black race.  With enough "bad pieces"-these being pieces one has collected through his/her life which lead to negative feelings towards that race, the individual will feel a negatitivity towards that race.  I believe it is realistic to assume that these pieces are everywhere and hencefourth, racism does not exist, but instead a sense of realism and an awakening...open up you eyes to what you know in your heart white brothers and sisters.

following, i would like to know why we Puerto Ricans being of mostly
european heritage are always been discriminated by the kkk and other
white groups, these groups label us as non whites, and this is very
much annoying for most of us we are also white and nobody can take 
that away from us no matter what language we speak. We dont have to 
prove our color to anybody, but for all of those ignorants out there
which cannot differentiate what is or who is a white person;do me a
favor pick up an antropology book or dictionary and look under different race 
and maybe you out there might races and see were the spanish people belong in.
and see were we belong to. please stop this nonsense just because we
have a different culture from white americans does not make us less 
white. 
<p>One very important contribution that us spanish people made in 
in world war 2 was that we were Germany ally, and we were and are
more extremists than you concerning race related subjects. read our
history and you'll find out thank you;

<h3><i>Looking for answers</i></h3>

<p><tt>Wed Jul 12 18:37 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>As a black male, your movement is of intense interest to me. Indeed as the saying goes 
"Hold thy friends close but thine enemies closer....". However I find myself looking 
for certain answers within your numbers.I respest your opinions as your opinions 
and in such a censored world I admire you for taking this stand for what you feel is right. 
Yet just 2 years ago I was beaten and left for dead by a group of Neo Nazi skinheads. 
This is the first thing that confuses me. I may hate everything your movement stands 
for yet it is not my right to violently force that upon others. To be honest, there have been 
times when I smiled at the idea of burning fields of skinheads but still this is not my right, 
to cause others to suffer for there beliefs. 

<p>This brings me to my next question. What society do you expect to build based on 
the persecution of others. Certaintly, it begins with your enemies but history has shown 
us that once that line has been crossed the field is open for persecution of ones former allies. 
Just look at eastern Europe's history or the tortured past of my own motherland, Africa. 

<p>This leads me onto my main query, one of the main problems I have with your movement. 
I am black and the world has made certain I know what goes along with this. But half my 
heritage is white and it is a half I am just as proud off. I am Irish, brought up fiercly Irish 
Catholic and from a very nationalistic family. This form off nationalism, bred by 1100 years 
of struggle is something that many of your ranks have no understanding of. Yet your movement 
tells me I have no right to rejoice in my white heritage. I hope you understand my questions 
and I hope you are not as cowardly as the 7 skinheads who were so brave in their battle 
with me and that you will confront me on paper. I thank you for your time.

<p>To me the concept of multi-culturalism is one of the most dangerous

American Colloquial English so that "Cultural Pronounciations" won't be discouraged.
They want separate dialects to flourish.  This can only fragment further
American society.  I must admit, perhaps contrary to some at this site, that
people of different backgrounds can be Americans.  But the must assimulate.
The must speak the American version of English, they can not have any other national loyalties,
They can not form special interest groups, lobbying for special treatment.
This idea of groups having the attitude that they can committ
crimes because what "society" did to the as a race is preposterous.
	
<p>I have a little problem with a National movement being exclusive though.
I want to join a Nationalist movement.  I feel in my heart that Nationalism
is the paste that glues us together.  To form the fist, rather than the open
hand.  I support foreign policies that put America's interest first.
I have little interest in fighting to change the out come of some elses civil
war, unless the US can reap substantial benefits.  

<p>I believe that if the Nationalist movement shifted to
a movement against multi-culturalism rather than multi-racism
our country can become the prosperious power it once was, and
deserves to be.

<h3><i></i>Canadian born - lost citizenship</h3>

<p><tt>Thu Jul  6 12:50 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>This may be a FAQ - my wife and I are British by birth, 
and had a son, Peter in Montreeal (1958), while "Landed immigrants". 
A few years later the family emigrated  to the US, and my wife and I 
added US Citizenship. This was also conferred automatically
on Peter even though he was under 18, and signed nothing.
The Canadian Embassy now inform him that he 'lost' Canadian
citizenship thereby, leaving him with just US and British citizenship.
Any comments ?
<p>I enjoy Up Front...

<p>I plan to start a WWW page that will contain reasoned discussion
of race, affirmative action, immigration etc.

<h3><i>Time for Proper Tribute to the Waffen-SS</i></h3>

<p><tt>Mon Jul 31 22:33 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>As the world looks from 1995 back, through the darkened glass of mainstream media distortion to 1945, I would like to highlight the need to pay proper tribute the millions of brave European men and women who fought bravely with the Waffen-SS.

<p>The Waffen (armed)-SS was a military field organization organized much the same way as the army (Wehrmacht) and quite distinct in its mission from the Allgemeine (general or police/civilian-oriented) SS.  Its mission was to provide a top quality elite presence on the battlefield to ensure the favorable resolution of critical tactical situations.

<p>The Waffen-SS is still the finest mass elite fighting force ever assembled.  More than two million men and women served in its ranks from 1939 through 1945.  The Waffen-SS pioneered many tactics and techniques that have been adopted by armies around the world.  For example, the Blitzkrieg ("lightning war") combined arms (infantry/tank/artillery/air) assault technique was often spearheaded by SS units.  The Waffen-SS pioneered the widespread use of the camouflage combat clothing that is used by nearly all armies today.

<p>In order to begin bringing attention to the courage and determination of these soldiers, I would like to mention some of the better known units:

<UL><LI>1st SS Panzer (Armored) Division "Liebstandarte Adolf Hitler" ("Personal Guard Regiment Adolf Hitler"; one of the first Waffen SS formations; distinguished itself on numerous occasions in the East)

<LI>2nd SS Panzer Division "Das Reich" ("The Realm"; the one they always called on when things got hot; often rescued encircled army units in the East against overwhelming Soviet forces; punched its way to within sight of the towers of the Kremlin)

<LI>5th SS Panzer Division "Wiking" ("Viking"; repeatedly gave the Soviets a bloody nose; feared in the East for its fierce assaults)

<LI>9th SS Panser Division "Hohenstauffen" (single-handedly decimated Monty's foolhardy airborne assault into Arnhem, Netherlands in 1944-see movie "A Bridge Too Far")</UL>

<P>There were also numerous Waffen-SS units made up of idealistic young volunteers from all over Europe.  These men hailed from Spain to Latvia and from Croatia to Norway.  Some of these European units that fought just as fiercely as their German brethren were:

<UL><LI>13th Waffen Gebirgs (Mountain) Division der SS (Croatian)

<LI>14th Waffen Grenadier (Infantry) Division der SS (Ukrainian)

<LI>15th Waffen Grenadier Division der SS  (Latvian)

<LI>21st Waffen Gebirgs Division der SS (Albanian)

<LI>28th SS Freiwilligen ("volunteer"; note: nearly all units were volunteer, whether designated as such or not) Grenadier Division (Walloon-Belgian)

<LI>29th Waffen Grenadier Division der SS (Italian)

<LI>31st SS Freiwilligen Grenadier Division (Bohemian-Moravian)

<LI>33rd Waffen Grenadier Division der SS "Charlemagne" (French)

<LI>34th SS Freiwilligen Grenadier Division "Landstorm Nederland" (Dutch)

<LI>41st Waffen Grenadier Division der SS "Kalevala" (Finnish)
</UL>
<P>Thank you for your Stormfront web site.  It is making a big difference for a lot of us out here.  Thanks in particular for the Spanish language section which has enabled an older relative who fought in Russia in WW2 to appreciate some of the news. 

<P>Keep up the good work and let us not forget these brave soldiers.

<h3><i>Ruby Ridge and Waco</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sat Jul 29 15:41 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>There has been anger from the far right and neo-nazi/militia types
concerning the incidents at Waco and Ruby Ridge.  I can understand
to a point the concern over Waco.  Here we had a branch of the 
government go a little trigger happy with Vernon Howell aka David Koresch.
Those people,however, had over 50 days to come out of that compound
and face the charges brought forth by the ATF.  Ultimatly, the entire
blame for the firey ending must be laid at the feed of child molester and
all around wacko, David Koresch.  The only tradegy here was the death
of the children and the 4 goverment agents.
<P>The standoff at Ruby Ridge is another story altogether.  The agent
who shot Mr. Weaver's wife and child was simply defending himself after
coming under fire by Randy Weaver.  I believe the reason Randy Weaver
was aquited of the charges is that is was difficult to prove who 
really fired upon the agents from the house.  It could have been Randy
or his wife.

<p>I LIKE MANY PEOPLE SURFING THE NET,   STUMBLED ON STORMFRONT, UNLIKE MANY OTHERS, I HAVE NOT FOUND ANYTHING ANTISEMITIC, OR RACIST TOWARD ANY MINORITY- NOT THAT I WAS LOOKING. IN LIGHT OF MY RECENT AWAKENING CONCERNING THE INTERNAL DESINTIGRATATION OF THE COUNTRY, I WANTED TO READ THE WRITINGS OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS AND GET THEIR VIEWS, SO HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS WAS WHAT I SOUGHT FROM THIS WEB SITE AND AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT STORMFRONT HAS PROVIDED AN EXCELLENT SOURCE OF LITERATURE. I DO AGREE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE GRAND EFFORTS TO SHUT IT DOWN THOUGH, THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND SPECIFICALLY THE HISTORICAL NARRATIVES (WITHOUT REVISION) ARE TOO THREATENING TO OUR CENSORS! THOSE WHO WOULD ENSLAVE US ARE VERY ABLE IN THE ART OF RE-INVENTING HISTORY AND WILL SURELY REENACT ITS MAJOR MILESTONES IF ALLOWED. THE FOUNDING FATHERS HAVE WARNED US WELL AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF WE CAN RESPOND BEFORE WE SUFFER THE FATE OF EVERY OTHER EMPIRE THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

<p>I am pleased to find this site. In Australia we have the same problems.
Our government is also trying to limit the freedoms of the population 
and take away the rights that helped build our country.
We also have a "Multicultural" society. Most of the immigrants that we 
have in this country have brought their hatred of the white race with them
and we are slowly becoming outnumbered. To even be in some areas of our
larger cities after dark is to be risking attack by machette weilding
groups of blacks or asians. 
<BR>point 1...why are governments taking from the people that contribute 
the most to society and giving it the those who contribute the least.
<BR>point 2...Why dont the so called refugees stay in their own country and
fight for it. I would rather fight and die for my freedoms than leave 
my brothers and sisters to suffer while I hid like a dog in another country.

<h3><i>Pride in accomplishment / Luck in race</i></h3>

<p><tt>Fri Jul 28 21:41 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>I've been on-line for approx. 4 years now and have lapped up my share of rhetoric from the extreme right to the extreme left and I've arrived at the following conclusion. All these hypenated Americans (Afro-American, Hispanic American, etc.) and the white pride folks seem to base their pride in something they had absolutely no control over: their race and ethnicity. I'm 36 years old and have met great people as well as major criminal-types of every race. I try to take pride in my accomplishments rather than the fact I'm white. (This is not to say that I'm not glad to be white, especially in this country. I'm not for "reverse-discrimination but am honest enough to realize that being white has it's advantages...even being a white male!). 

<P>I see your letters represent the spectrum from intelligent "aryans" to the neanderthal "lets send 'em to afrika / six million more" crowd. I disgaree with most every report I see represented as "the truth" since I believe those dedicated to a cause (a white homeland) would consider lying to be an economical weapon of choice. But I'm glad you have the right to print your words. Don't get me wrong though.... when the "jackbooted thugs" come for me (whether their yours or someone else's) I'll be ready!

<p>Has anyone else out there noticed the dramatic increase in inter-
racial dating over the past couple of years?  It seems to me that many
white women are no longer interested in dating white men.  A day
doesn't go by when I don't see one or two mixed couples....on weekends
I often see over a dozen.  What is going on here?  Is it just a "fad".
Is it happening all over the country or is it just here in the
shadow of Wash DC?

<P>I'm a single white male - I'm told I'm attractive, that I have a good
sense of humor...I'm reasonably athletic, gainfully employed and
what I want more than anything else on earth is to be a husband.  But,
I seem to be lacking a quality alot of white women are looking for:
black skin.

<P>I think Stormfront is great...but I have suggestion for you:  Create a
"single whites" section where like-minded men and women can get in
contact.  This maybe a crazy idea from your perspective - but how else
will our race survive if we don't do those things to help promote
its procreation?

<h3><i>Statistics</i></h3>

<p><tt>Sat Jul 22 19:54 EDT 1995</tt>

<p>Dear Sirs,

I enjoy your web page very much, but I don't believe you go far
enough in content.  Please let me explain.  If the average white 
person is ever going to truly understand the reality of the 
differences which exist between the white race and the black race,
they MUST be allowed to view the statistical data which so plainly
and clearly illustates all the points you and I are trying to make.
The liberal media "shields" the average person from the true facts,
because to do otherwise would be "insensitive" or not "politically
correct."  

<P>The true numbers are staggering!  Blacks are ravaging the
nation with crime, and the liberal media is worried about offending
certain members of society with the truth!!!  A sign of the times, 
my friends.  If you'll observe, the media seemingly always points to
crime statistices, HIV/AIDS statistics, illegitimate birth rate
statistics, and health statistics in terms of ALL races combined.  
However, when you actually take the time to read the race dependent
numbers (e.g. The stats which catagorize sets of data according to
race) published by such government organizations as, The Centers For
Disease Control,  The Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Central
Intelligence Agency, it rapidly becomes apparent that the black
community is responsible for a very large and disproportionate amount
of crime and HIV/AIDS in this country!  The media also fails to
indicate that if you are white, and you practice heterosexual sex
with a partner of your own race and whose practices are the same as 
yours, your chances of contracting HIV are far, far lower than those
of homosexuals, blacks, and illicit drug users.  How is it that blacks
comprise less than 13 percent of our society, and account for so much
turmoil?  Read "The Bell Curve" for a better understanding!  Sirs, I
strongly encourage you to produce numerous graphs on your WWW page
which clearly illustrate what the liberal media tries so hard to hide.
If you can help to force these numbers into the light, more people
might join our common cause.  Sadly, because of the media, many people
just aren't aware of the truth.  And if you do decide to create 
graphs, be sure to include the U.S. Goverment sources from which the 
data originates.  This will lend additional credibility to the data.
Otherwise, the liberal media will simply discount the data as being
misrepresented by "right-wing extremists"!  Finally, let me encourage
each of you to vote Republican during the next election!

<P>Sirs, feel free to print this letter, but please withhold my email
address.  I work for the U.S. Government and my job would be at 
jeopardy if it is discovered that I'm writing letters like this one
while I'm at work.  (I know, it's very sad that the "PC" crowd is
killing the first amendment.)  I am very proud of my political
position, but I can't afford to lose my job.  I don't hate all blacks,
and I don't love all whites.  I just feel the country would be
better off without them (blacks) as a whole, and they'd be better off 
back in their natural habitat.  If they continue to stay, they will 
continue to be like a huge "dead weight" over the shoulders of each
REGULAR-American.

<h3><i>Affirmative action</i></h3>

<p>Recently the Atlanta Journal/Constitution solicited our opinion on affirmative action. Below is the text of my letter:

<p>Affirmative action is a failure both to those it is intended to help and to those on whom the onus of mandated madness is imposed. You will always have the poor with you. Using police state tactics Russia spent 70 years trying to create a classless society. Such utopian dreams are in Plato's Republic and this scenario is acted out faithfully by our social insects but never by man, the free thinker.

<p>Our minority citizens, the Koreans, Chinese, Indians inter alios work and succeed in this society. Our African ex-slaves are ironically enslaved by the very social welfare system funded to help them. To further the irony businesses see them as a legal liability due to anti-business legislation. It is simply too dangerous to hire them because they can bring in the "feds" on any whimsical, fancied injustice. 

<p>The white man, be he employer or employee, is tossed into this egregious nightmare of balances and quotas. The employer faces a paperwork jungle of forms to be submitted; the well-qualified prospective employee may not get the job because of the numbers racket played by the E.O.E., etc.
In conclusion, affirmative action is an idealistic, unworkable doctrine of equality. Friedrich Nietzsche foresaw this more than 100 years ago. On equality he wrote: "There is no more poisonous poison anywhere: for it seems to be preached by justice itself, whereas it really is the termination of justice. Equal to the equal, unequal to the unequal - that would be the true slogan of justice; and also its corollary: Never make equal what is unequal."

<h3><i>Who Can You Trust</i></h3>

<p>How does a visitor to your Internet site know that it is not a front
run by the FBI??  I certainly do not mean to impugn your integrity or honor but,
after Waco and Ruby Ridge, it is clear to me that the federal government is out
of control. 

<p>Lies and coverups are the standard fare from Reno, Freeh
and the bleeding heart liberals who have ruined this country. If
Horiuchi is still on the payroll, and if the architect for Ruby Ridge and Waco can
be promoted to the #2 position at the FBI, one does not have to be
a genius to discern a coverup. Where is the accountability?? If one writes
their Senator/Congressman/Congresswoman, neither a Democrat, or a
Republican, will give a straight answer on Weaver's entrapment, the murder
of his son and wife, or explain why Potts was promoted. The reason
is that the Congress has built this moster that can assassinate at will,
and the Congress will NOT rein it in. Just watch the 12 July hearings. All
you will se is hot air, and no action to curb BATF/FBI abuses.

of the 60s and early 70s. Otherwise, they'd just be collecting more 
names of more dissidents to go along with millions of others. They 
could do the same thing just as effectively by visiting any working class bar.

<P>In actuality, the World Wide Web doesn't lend itself to collecting 
names. Only IP addresses are logged by the server, any one of which could 
represent many users - millions in the case of Prodigy, AOL or Compuserve.

<P>There's also the fact that I've been pretty well known in White Nationalist

<h3><i>Crossroads of Race</i></h3>

<p>We are at a crossroads my fellow Americans.  To all sides of the poltical and ideological 
spectrums groups claim dominance.  It is time, America, to make that choice. As I see it we have 
three options. 1.  Become a totalitarian state which would be ruled by unfair martial law. 
2. Adopt a new form of government and national idenity. Maybe that will be a white state, 
maybe it will resemble our current government, then again, maybe not. 3. Continue on our path to 
doom of overcrowding and loss of any pride, nationalism or happiness with this country. 

<p>If we do not take the steps now for a peaceful state of white cizens, this will be the battlle cry 10 years from now, when I'm 25, "This wrld rejects me. This world threw me away. This world never gave me a chance. This world gonna have to pay....sometimes I think I could I'm gonna burn this whole world down!!!!!" Trent Reznor.          

<p>And once this crossroads is passed nihlism and anarchy lay in wait.

<h3><i>StormFront; Living Proof</i></h3>

<p>I tripped over your WebPage quite by accident, and found it to be
the most interesting thing I'd read in weeks.  I disagree with
some of the views espoused here, but that's not why I'm dropping 
this line.  The very people who claim to be protecting the national
interests are the ones that would shut operations like yours down
in a heartbeat.  These charlatans are the true Anti-Americans.  I
think it was Thomas Jefferson who coined the phrase, "I don't agree
with a thing you're saying - and I will defend to the death your
right to say it."

<p>It is through organizations like yours that the American spirit is
preserved.

<p>Peace.

<h3><i>Hail Victory!</i></h3>

<p>Racial greetings my brothers and sisters! You do not know how happy I am to see a White Nationalist website. We are proving as a race that we can get our message across on a grand scale. Do you know how frightening that is to ZOG? 

<p>As we all know, they will try their best to shut us up. Remember Randy Weaver's family, our brothers in prisons around the world, and our brothers who have been taken to Valhalla/heaven. This fight is for them, for us, and for the future of our race!

<h3><i>What kind of people do YOU want living in your Utopia?</i></h3>

<p>This is more or less a follow on from my previous posting on the eight
year old asian girl who had ciggarettes stubbed out on her back by a
racist white guy. One person who claimed to be a member of the Ku Klux 
Klan said he would have gone further and tied the girl to a cartwheel 
and shoved barbed wire into her bodily orifices.

<p>What I want to ask is whether white separatists want people like this 
living in your white Utopia?  Do you realy want someone who do something
like that to a little girl (whatever her colour).  Do you want someone
who'd sooner stub out cigarrettes on a little girl's back than give you
the time of the day.  After all, to do something like that takes more
than 'having pride in your race'.  It takes a person who has something
wrong in their head.

<p>Let's take this further.  Say you where in a balloon 25000 feet above
the Atlantic with an asian doctor (who'd treat anyone regardless of 
skin colour) and a  racist white guy who couldn't find his butt if you
gave him a map. You need to throw someone out because you're running 
out of hot air.  Who would you throw out?

<P><I>[Ed: Your image of White Nationalists is the grotesque media caricature. 
No genuine White Nationalist would engage in gratuitous cruelty against other races. 
No genuine White Nationalist is interested in oppressing other races. We are 
fighting for the right to our own nation free of outside interference, just as 
other races should have the same right.

<P>Multiculturalism has created an enormous amount of resentment and racial animosity
on both sides. Most racial violence is committed by Blacks or browns against Whites, and 
is given little play by the media. Nevertheless, it isn't that hard for the media 
find a few White criminals victimizing non-Whites, and twist this into an indictment 
of White Nationalism.]</I>

<h3><i>FREE AT LAST!  FREE AT LAST!</i></h3>

<p>I'm just dropping a line to all concerned White Separatists who wrote
me with encouragement during my recent incarceration.  After 3 weeks in
the gulag, I am free, and back in business 110%!

<p>Check out the July issue of DETAILS Magazine, it carries a jumbo
story on Resistance Records and yours truly.  Form your own conclusions.
I am working on issue 5 of RESISTANCE Magazine, which will carry some
very interesting articles.

<p>Anyone who saw the CNN piece a couple weeks back may have noticed the
concert footage of RAHOWA.  That footage was taken from our upcoming 2
hour long concert video, on sale in the next issue of RESISTANCE (#5).

<p>Also coming in the same issue is a two CD box set "TRIBUTE TO
SKREWDRIVER".  Over two hours of music!  32 songs!  It is great . . .

<p>Anyways, I am currently out on appeal bail. My appeal comes up on
January 30th, 1996 (or later).  The Canadian ZOG have been gleefully
celebrating my "demise" due to the fact that entry into the U.S. with a
felony conviction is hard. Winning my appeal is very important to my
future movement goals for this reason. Doing the time is not the
problem, it is the transit problems afterwards.  They already
interrogate me for 2 hours when they intercept me trying to enter the
U.S., if they have an actual reason, it will get worse.

<p>Enough said already.  Sorry if the letter is a little disjointed, I
have three weeks worth of missed opportunities to pursue, and our
enemies never rest!

<h3><i>Genocide</i></h3>

<p>In Los Angeles there stands a temple to indoctrinate and punish free
thinkers known as the "Museum of Tolerance"; it was built by the
preserver of the collective human conscience, Simon Wiesenthal. Inside
this Disneyland of correct thought, the "E ticket to ride", is the
portrayal of all white people as the true hateful scourge of mankind. 

<p>My question is why there isn't a permanent display about the genocide
which the Jews themselves have commited. The book of Joshua outlines
seven people groups which the Jews eradicated completely from the Earth.
Has anyone met a Canaanite, Perizite, Amalakite etc. lately? Why isn't
the Museum of Tolerance at least honest about this mass slaughter of
humanity? I support genocide when it is God's will (as was the case in
the book of Joshua) so I'm not condemning them for what they did, but
what gives them the moral high ground to condemn such atrocities as
Hitler may have committed when they themselves have baggage seven times
worse?

those who suffer econmically. Put your time and energy towards something

<h3><i>End justifies the means?</i></h3>

<p>I'd like to ask white nationalists to what extent they would go in
upholding their beliefs. An asian family were forced out of there home
in a predominately white neighbourhood in which they were accpeted by
all but one particular family. The child of the asian family, a girl
aged eight had ciggarettes stubbed out on her back as she was walking
back from school by the eighteen year old boy of the racist family.

<p>I'd like to ask whether people agree with this.

<h3><i>Revisionism and Patriotism</i></h3>

<p>Brousing through your pages, I noticed a good deal of Revisionist
literature.  Additionally, there is much devoted to the current Patriot
ideas around today.

<p>Revisionists have always amazed me to the extent that they are able
to further their point.  In the face of mountains of evidence in the
form testimonials, confessions, and archival documents and film they
continue to deny that the Holocasut occured.  They pull this off with a
mix of semantics (there was no *intended* slaughter of the Jews, Jews
were killed, but *not* in gas chambers, etc.) and conspiracy theories
(confessions were beaten out of Germans, survivors are part of a Zionist
plot, films, documents and diaries were forged, etc.) that allows them
to deny the existence of the murder of Europe's Jews without saying
anything at all. Sophistry, if you ask me.

<p>Modern Patriots butcher the ideas of our founding fathers support
their goals.  They consistently ignore the fact that their ideal nation
failed (I'm thinking here of the 13 states as they existed under the
articles of Confederation....or alternately the Confederate States
during the Civil War) for precisely the reason the Union was formed,
lack of a strong Central government.  America was saved from
Jeffersonian Democracy by the federalists and we a huge debt of
grattitude as a nation to men like John Marshall.

<p>Forgive the random tone of this message, and please note that I
avoided any of the name calling you alluded to on the letters page.  I
dare you to post this.

<h3><i>Suggested Actions - Local Control</i></h3>

<p>Purchase a reliable firearm for every member of the family and learn
to use it.  It is necessary to have at least one completely legal
semi-automatic rifle or shotgun for use in cases of self-defense or
civil disorder.

<p>Second, be at least marginally respectful toward your local terror
police.  Buy the sheriff a cup of coffee if you see him at a resturaunt,
or give a friendly wave when you pass the state patrol. The rich man's
militia has the power to selectively enforce laws against us or against
our opponents.  They also serve as information gatherers for power
brokers in Washington and Tel Aviv.  The first step toward breaking
their hold lies in befriending the neighborhood cop, and voting for a
sympathetic boss in the next election.

<p> Anti-White facists in the Republican and Democratic parties are
gearing up for the 1996 corporate buy-out of Washington.  Both will turn
a blind eye to their past policies and attempt to cater to the emerging
body of armed patriots.  There also will be talk of greater anti-crime,
anti-terrorism, and anti-gun legislation to appease frightened liberals.
We'll have to eventually choose the lesser of a few evils, but we must
reserve our charitable funds and time for securing local control.  A few
hundred dollars and forty hours of work won't buy a plank on the
Republican platform, but it can tip the scales in a local sheriff's
election.
<p>There was a time when no jury in the South would convict a Klansman.
As our laws become more and more coercive, we need to return to the old
methods.  As we prepare for the 1996 elections, we should consolidate
local power by infiltrating police departments, befriending potential
jurors, and developing information networks - through radio, phone
trees, and email - that interpret news from a different standpoint than
our mass media.

<h1><center>The Boers Strike Back!</center></h1>
<P>
<em>So many people ask what happened in South Africa - mainly "why did the
Afrikaners not fight?" and so on.
<p>
For people wanting to know the truth, herewith follows an extract from
an unpublished book by <a href="mailto:odin@pixie.co.za">Odin</a>, in which the events leading up to and
surrounding the April 1994 hand over to the ANC are detailed.</em>

<hr width=80% align=center size=4>

<h2><center>The True story of Boer Resistance to the ANC Takeover in South Africa!</center></h2>
<P>
There are many critics who accuse the Afrikaner Resistance Movement -
AWB in Afrikaans - of "having done nothing" to try and physically
prevent the takeover of South Africa by the ANC - as had long been that
organization's war cry by it's leader, Eugene Terre'Blanche at AWB
rallies.
<P>
This criticism is based on ignorance of the facts - the truth is that
out of all of the numerous right wing organizations which threatened
violence and uprising should the ANC take over, the only organized
active physical resistance came from the AWB - and this was acknowledged
in a strange way by the government of the time with the calling out of a
state of emergency in the Western Transvaal in April 1994.
<P>
This campaign of violence resulted in the deaths of 21 people and damage
to the tune of R70 million - a not insubstantial effort by anyone's
reckoning.
<P>
After a series of smaller bomb blasts in Western Transvaal towns such as
Bloemhof and Sannieshof, the first indication of real trouble came with
the destruction of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)
broadcast tower serving the Western Transvaal during the week running up
to the April 1994 "one man one vote" elections.
<P>
On Friday night, 22 April 1994, a bomb destroyed the Department of Home
Affairs offices in Potgietersrus in the Northern Transvaal, and an
important petrol pipeline running from the Sasol complex in the northern
Orange Free State was severely damaged by another powerful bomb the same
night. The pipeline blast caused a spectacular fire.
<P>
It was however a bombing campaign which occurred in the days immediately
leading up to the election which caused international headlines and for
a while did caused many observers to seriously question whether the
elections would go ahead or not.
<P>
During this bombing campaign, the largest bombs ever to be detonated in
South Africa's history were to go off - bombs four times as big as the
biggest bomb that the ANC had ever been able to detonate during its 29
year long guerrilla campaign.
<P>
In the resulting court case in which a total of 27 AWB members - all
members of the AWB's black shirted elite unit, the "Iron Guard" (or
Ystergarde" in Afrikaans) - the state put together in its charge sheet
one of the most interesting cases the South African courts had ever
seen.
<P>
The charge sheet, which was finally formulated in December 1994,
contained many startling allegations, which included the following -
(the parts in quotation marks are taken directly from the charge sheet):

<blockquote>
<p>
"1. On or about 21 April 1994 accused Clint Entlish, Josias Cruywagen,
and Jan Kruger illegally broke into the club house of the Para-Shop
parachute club at the PC Pelser Airport at Krugersdorp and therefrom
stole the following items: 9 parachutes, one book entitled Sky Diving in
78 days; one Altimaster meter, four Auto Page Student Helmet Mount
Radios; 5 Motorola carriers for the Helmet Mount radios; 2 holders for
Motorola Two Way transmitters, and 1 King Kx99 ground to air tranciever.
These items were found on 27 April 1994 during the arrest action carried
out at the Waterval shooting range in the district of Rustenburg and
were found on or in the vicinity of mentioned shooting range.
<p>
2. On 21 April 1994 accused Nicolaas Barnard, Abraham Myburgh and Jan
Kruger carried out a reconnaissance on a game farm named `Springfontein'
in the Koster region (hereafter called the game farm) in order to
establish if it was suitable as a basis for the preparation and
execution of the aforementioned conspiracy.
<p>
3. On 23 April 1994 a group of persons gathered together at the game
farm for the purpose of furthering and executing aforementioned
conspiracy.
<p>
4. On or about 23 April 1994 and on the game farm, under the leadership
of Jan Kruger, assisted by one Johan Du Plessis (hereafter called Du
Plessis) started planning on how to steal motor vehicles for use in
attacks on (Black) taxis and taxi ranks, terror attacks and motor car
bombs.
<p>
5. On 23 April 1994 accused Etienne le Roux, Nicolaas Barnard, and
Abraham Myburgh, along with a co-conspirator named Jacob Koekemoer
(hereafter called Koekemoer) went to the farm Koesterfontein in the
Magaliesburg region (hereafter called Koesterfontein) in the Koester
district. Here accused Nicolaas Barnard told Koekemoer, who as a miner
was familiar with the workings of explosives, to build a bomb for use in
an act of terror in the center of Johannesburg. Koekemoer then with the
help of accused Etienne le Roux, Nicolaas Barnard, and Abraham Myburgh,
proceeded to build the bomb in an Audi motor car with registration
number HRZ 071T. This vehicle was lent to accused Nicolaas Barnard by
the owner thereof, with the purpose of using it in such terror attack.
<p>
Etienne le Roux, Nicolaas Barnard, and Abraham Myburgh proceeded with
the aforementioned Audi, in which the bomb was concealed, as well as a
second motor vehicle to the center of Johannesburg where they detonated
the bomb at 09h50 in Bree Street. (Ten people were killed in the blast,
and dozens more were injured. Damage to surrounding buildings was so
extensive that an entire block had to be demolished and water and
telephone supplies were cut to the entire city center).
<p>
7. On the same day Koekemoer proceeded to manufacture 20 pipe bombs at
Koesterfontein. These bombs were taken on 24 April to the Game farm by
accused Etienne le Roux, Nicolaas Barnard and Abraham Myburgh.
<p>
8. During the evening of 24 April 1994 accused (AWB secretary general)
Nico Prinsloo, (Ystergarde chief) Leon van der Merwe, Johannes Smit,
Abraham Fourie and Du Plessis, gathered behind closed doors on the game
farm. After this meeting Du Plessis and accused Abraham Fourie gathered
together all the persons on the game farm together (sentries included).
Thereafter accused Abraham Myburgh explained the workings of the pipe
bombs to the gathered persons. Du Plessis then asked for volunteers, who
had motor vehicles available, to carry out attacks with aforementioned
pipe bombs. He also asked for crew to accompany these drivers during the
execution of these attacks. The target areas for the attacks and the
groups were identified as follows:
<p>
(a) Westonaria: Accused Jan Kruger, Martin Wiebosch (hereafter called
Wiebosch) and Tiaan Potgieter (hereafter called Potgieter) in Wiebosch's
vehicle;
<p>
(b) Randfontein : Accused Clint Entlish, Josias Cruywagen, Johannes
Venter in Clint Entlish's vehicle;
<p>
(c) Pretoria: Accused Jacobus Nel, Petrus Steyn, and Gerhardus Fourie in
accused Jacobus Nel's vehicle;
<p>
(d) Krugersdorp: Jan Pieter Hanekom (hereafter called Hanekom); with
persons unknown in aforementioned Hanekom's vehicle. This group however
lost its nerve and hid the bomb at a place unknown to the state and
returned to the game farm without having accomplished their mission.
<p>
9. On 25 April 1994 accused Jan Kruger, together with Wiebosch and
Potgieter detonated a pipe bomb at a taxi rank on the Westonaria
-Carletonville road near to Westonaria. No persons were hurt during the
explosion but damage was inflicted to vehicles. On their return to the
game farm these persons gave a report back to accused AWB secretary
general Nico Prinsloo and Ystergarde chief Leon van der Merwe, after
these two asked about the course of the operation.
<p>
10. On 25 April 1994 accused Clint Entlish, Etienne le Roux and Johannes
Venter detonated a pipe bomb at a taxi rank on the corner of Third and
Park Streets, Randfontein. No persons were hurt during this explosion
and vehicles were damaged.
<p>
11. On 25 April 1994 accused Jacobus Nel, Petrus Steyn and Gerhardus
Fourie detonated a pipe bomb in a restaurant at 20h30 on the corner of
Bloed Street and 7th Avenue in Marabastad, Pretoria. (Three people were
killed in this attack on a Black owned and frequented eating house near
the Pretoria city center).
<p>
12. On 24 April 1994 Koekemoer, with the help of accused Etienne le
Roux, Nicolaas Barnard, Abraham Myburgh and Jan de Wet, as well as
accused Abraham Vlok built a further bomb at the game farm in a Karet
trailer with serial number LM6-R-343 STD and a registration number NSY
742 T.
<p>
13. Aforementioned trailer was, with the bomb mounted therein, taken to
Germiston on 25 April 1994. Accused Jan de Wet drove the vehicle which
pulled the trailer, while Abraham Vlok was the crew. Accused Etienne le
Roux and Du Plessis accompanied the other two to Germiston, in Etienne
le Roux's vehicle. The bomb was detonated at 08h45 in Odendaal Street,
Germiston. (Eight people were killed in this attack, which also
destroyed dozens of Black taxis).
<p>
14. The explosives used in the building of the aforementioned trailer
were supplied by accused Cornelius Botha (jnr) and Cornelius Botha
(snr).
<p>
15. A further group of conspirators which included accused Johannes
Olivier, Serge D'Abbadie and Dirk Meyer, who were under the command of
accused Milestone Sharp, arrived at the game farm on the morning of 25
April 1994 from Natal. After their arrival on the game farm accused (AWB
secretary general) Nico Prinsloo, who introduced himself as `general
Prinsloo' informed them about the situation. The core of his talk
contained the following: (his precise words are unknown to the state):
<p>
15.1 That it was now war and that those who want to leave the game farm
will be shot;
<p>
15.2 That a few bombs had already gone off. He explained that another
group, the Boere Krisis Aksie (the Boer Crisis Action- a group of
militant Afrikaner farmers) had also left off a few bombs, and that the
Telkom exchange and electronic instrumentation which had been blown up
was the work of the BKA. He said that the BKA had been informed that the
telecommunications were of such a nature that they could not afford for
them to be destroyed, but that they however would have no problem if the
BKA destroyed power lines.
<p>
15.3 That the persons at the farm could expect to be there for at least
two or three months;
<p>
15.4 That strict entrance control would be implemented and that no-one
could enter or leave the area without permission;
<p>
15.5 That there could be a visit from the police and it must look like
those present were busy with a training camp;
<p>
15.6 That illegal weapons must be hidden in the hills around the camp,
but in such a manner that they could easily be picked up;
<p>
15.7 That it was fairly safe on the game farm as guards had been
deployed on top of the hill and by the gate;
<p>
15.8 That they were going to see strange things and that certain persons
would be busy building things but that this would be no reason for
concern;
<p>
15.9 That the men should now forget for a while about their women, but
that opportunity would be given to phone them and to visit them on
certain weekends;
<p>
15.10 That when the men did go and telephone their wives, they would be
escorted by two members of the Ystergarde.
<p>
16. The accused Johannes Smit also addressed the persons and amongst
other things said to them:
<p>
16.1 That his 9mm pistol was illegal. He took his weapon out and showed
it to the men;
<p>
16.2 That if someone tried to run away, he personally would shoot them
dead;
<p>
16.3 That a roster would be worked out for guard duties;
<p>
16.4 That illegal weapons should be hidden;
<p>
16.5 That each person should write his name on a piece of paper and
indicate what his area of speciality was.
<p>
17. Accused Abraham Fourie, who acted as camp commander, then also
addressed the men. He laid out the rules with regard to camp hygiene and
said that no-one could leave the camp without his permission.
<p>
18. On 26 April 1994 the game farm was evacuated and those present,
including the accused and persons unknown to the state, moved in several
small convoys, using secondary roads, to a shooting range at Waterval in
the district of Rustenburg (hereafter called the shooting range).
<p>
19. After their arrival at the shooting range accused (AWB secretary
general) Nico Prinsloo gave orders to accused Clint Entlish and Jan
Kruger to hide a number of pipe bombs, explosives and explosive
equipment in the bush, which they then did.
<p>
20. Accused Milestone Sharp then gave accused Serge D'Abbadie and one
Pieter Swanepoel and Anton Oelofse orders to hide the following items in
the bush: a R1 rifle, a box with R1 ammunition, and two bottles
containing explosives.
<p>
21. Accused Abraham Fourie then gave the men orders to conceal illegal
weapons in the surrounding bush. If the police should arrive at the
scene the hidden weapons should be quickly obtained and the police
should be led into an ambush if they approached the bushes, he said. He
further told the men that the police were going to be informed of their
presence there, but that the purpose of their presence there was going
to be made out to be for training and patrols.
<p>
22. During the night of 26 April 1994 accused Nicolaas Barnard and
accused Jan Kruger and Du Plessis gave orders to the men to go and fetch
the pipe bombs which accused Clint Entlish and Jan Kruger had earlier
hidden in the bush. Accused Jan Kruger and Du Plessis then fetched five
pipe bombs and handed them to accused Abraham Myburgh. Thereafter
accused (AWB secretary general) Nico Prinsloo gave orders to accused Jan
Kruger and Du Plessis to go and fetch the rest of the hidden explosives,
which was then done.
<p>
23. Accused Abraham Myburgh then gave two pipe bombs to accused
Milestone Sharp, Johannes Olivier, Serge D'Abbadie, Willem Hattingh,
Andreas Coetzee and Hercules Coetzee, as well as the other conspirators
who had come from Natal. Accused Abraham Myburgh explained to the
aforementioned conspirators how to detonate the pipe bombs. The two
bombs were destined to be detonated in the Benoni area. Accused Johannes
Olivier, Serge D'Abbadie, Willem Hattingh, Andreas Coetzee as well as
one Doppies Treurnicht left for Benoni at approximately 18h00. Two
vehicles were used for the expedition. One vehicle was used as a lead
car while the pipe bombs were transported in the second car.
<p>
24. Around 21h40 during the evening of 26 April 1994 accused Johannes
Olivier who was driving a vehicle with Doppies Treurnicht as passenger,
drove through a police roadblock in Main Reef Road West, Benoni. The
vehicle was pursued by members of the Benoni traffic department. Shots
were then fired from the vehicle at the traffic policemen. After accused
Johannes Olivier brought the vehicle to a standstill, he and Doppies
Treurnicht jumped out and ran way. Accused Johannes Olivier was arrested
a short way away but Doppies Treurnicht got away. In the vehicle one
pipe bomb was found. Shortly thereafter another pipe bomb was found
alongside the road where it had been thrown out of the aforementioned
vehicle before it driven through the police road block. Accused Serge
D'Abbadie, Willem Hattingh and Andreas Coetzee returned during the
course of the night of 26/27 April to the shooting range.
<p>
25. During the night of 26 April 1994 some of the conspirators at the
shooting range moved by car to the farm of accused Jan de Wet where they
met their wives.
<p>
26. During the evening of 25 April accused Willem Hattingh and Andreas
Coetzee stole a Peugeot vehicle with registration number FXS768T from
Homelake Street, Randfontein.
<p>
27. During the evening of 26 April 1994 the aforementioned Koekemoer,
with the help of accused Etienne le Roux, Nicolaas Barnard, Cornelius
Botha (jnr), Cornelius Botha (snr) and Gert Alberts, made a bomb in the
aforementioned Peugeot. Accused Nicolaas Barnard explained to accused
Etienne le Roux and Du Plessis how to detonate the bomb.
<p>
28. On 27 April 1994 at approximately 02h45 accused Nicolaas Barnard
gave orders to accused Etienne le Roux, Jan Kruger and Du Plessis to go
to Jan Smuts International Airport (Johannesburg) with the
aforementioned Peugeot and detonate it. Accused Jan Kruger and Du
Plessis drove in the Peugeot while accused Etienne le Roux accompanied
them in another vehicle. At approximately 07h00 the same morning the
bomb was detonated in the under cover parking area at Jan Smuts airport.
No persons were killed during the explosion but the persons named in
charges 64 to 73 were seriously injured during the explosion.
<p>
29. Early in the morning of 27 April 1994 at the shooting range accused
Milestone Sharp gave the order to the conspirators to pack up and move
off the range. At about 05h15 the same morning members of the South
African police swooped on the shooting range while the conspirators were
busy withdrawing. Accused Nicolaas Barnard, Abraham Myburgh, Milestone
Sharp, Johannes Smit, Clint Entlish, Serge D'Abbadie, Willem Hattingh,
Andreas Coetzee, Cornelius Botha (jnr), Cornelius Botha (snr), Dirk
Meyer, Hercules Coetzee and Gert Alberts were the persons arrested in
the immediate vicinity of the shooting range.
<p>
30. During the arrests the accused as mentioned in paragraph 29, the
following items were seized in the immediate vicinity of the shooting
range:
<p>
(a) 16 machine guns as in charge 80;
<br>
(b) nine unlicensed firearms as in charge 82;
<br>
(c) 30 465 rounds of ammunition of various calibers;
<br>
(d) forty licensed firearms;
<br>
(e) four crossbows with arrows;
<br>
(f) 32 two way radios;
<br>
(g) four bullet proof vests;
<br>
(h) nine parachutes;
<br>
(i) one angle grinder;
<br>
(j) one welding machine;
<br>
(k) eight battery chargers;
<br>
(l) explosives, explosive devices and parts thereof:
<ul><dl>
<li>1 x 150 gram Dinogel explosive;
<li>49 x 250 gram Emex explosive;
<li>7 x 150 gram Emex explosive;
<li>62 x 250 gram Tovex explosive;
<li>2 x 150 gram Emex packaging;
<li>1 x 250 gram Cordtex fuse;
<li>1 x 500ml soft drink bottle containing Emex explosive;
<li>2 x M65 hand grenades;
<li>1 x limpet mine;
<li>100 x ordinary attaching fuse;
<li>5 x ordinary electric detonators;
<li>13 x electronically delayed detonators;
<li>20 x wax cartridges with megnadet detonating systems;
<li>50 x Sure Start electric igniters for fuses;
<li>1 x roll Stope Cord 9 fuse;
<li>5 x rolls slow burning fuse;
<li>1 x roll Stope line fuse;
</ul></dl>
<p>
(m) medical equipment including bandages and intravenous feeding apparatus;
<br>
(n) 173 back packs with additional clothing which included camouflage of different organizations;
<br>
(o) a large quantity of non perishable foodstuffs."
</blockquote>

<P>
It is worth noting the second last item listed above as being seized at
the shooting range: 173 back packs were found but in total only about 40
men were ever arrested.
<P>
It would be fair then to presume that the 40 men so arrested did not
each carry two or three back packs, so then it appears as if there are
still more than 130 people who were present at the shooting range,
apprehended and indeed unidentified.
<P>
Other incidents of note during the same period included the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the bomb blast in Bree Street, Johannesburg, killed an ANC candidate
in the elections, a white woman by the name of Susan Keane.
<LI>at the scene of the Pretoria restaurant bombing, a police guard at the
scene of the blast, shot and killed a White man who was part of a group
of Whites who were scratching through the rubble at 3am the following
morning, apparently in search of clues which might lead to the identity
of the bombers. The men were all wearing balaclavas.
<LI>before the police roadblock system achieved its breakthrough in
Benoni, the police had offered a R2 million reward to any person
providing information which would lead to the arrest and conviction of
the bombers - the largest reward ever offered in South African history.
<LI>several other bombs exploded at various places around the country as
well, with the biggest of these going off in Kimberly in the Northern
Cape.
</ul>
<P>
The new South African constitution ironically guaranteed the right to
bail, so the AWB men initially arrested at the Rustenburg shooting range
were granted bail of R10 000 each.
<P>
Not all the accused were arrested at the shooting range. Several were
arrested later as the police started to put together a picture of what
they believed had happened. One of those who was the last to be arrested
was Etienne le Roux, who was only granted bail during the court case
itself. Doppies Treurnicht, the man in the car which was stopped at the
roadblock in Benoni, was eventually arrested eleven months later in
March 1995 at his home town of Port Nolloth in the Northern Cape. He
however turned state witness, and was not charged.
<P>
Evidence presented before the court contained some dramatic revelations
not contained in the charge sheet, and these revelations included the
following:
<P>
The state's case rested heavily on AWB turncoats and the king pin in
this evidence has been Jacob Koekemoer, one of those originally arrested
at the shooting range. Without his evidence the state would have battled
to put together a case at all, even though there were a number of other
corroborating witnesses as well.
<P>
Koekemoer, who had been kept in protective custody, testified before the
Rand Supreme Court that he had helped to build the bombs which were used
in the bombing campaign of April 1994. He said he had been approached by
AWB commandant (and accused) Abraham Fourie, while on a game farm on the
weekend prior to the April elections. Fourie had asked him if he had
knowledge of explosives, to which he replied that he was a qualified
blaster on the mines. He was asked to accompany accused Etienne le Roux,
Clifton Barnard and Abraham Myburgh, who drove to the Koesterfontein
farm in the Krugersdorp area, on Saturday 23 April 1994.
<P>
At the farm they unloaded six 50 kg bags of Anfax explosives from the
boot of the car. Barnard said they wanted to build a car bomb, or a bomb
to be placed next to a building to cause large scale damage. He said
they hoped this would "prevent the Blacks from voting."
<P>
Koekemoer told the men that a car bomb would be more suitable, as it
would not be noticeable. They built the bomb by placing 100 kg of Anfax
mixed with diesel in the barrel of a grass roller. Koekemoer then placed
20 sticks of Watergel plastic explosive in the center of the barrel,
before another 100 kg mix of Anfax and diesel was used to fill it.
<P>
All four of them loaded the grass roller into the boot of a blue gray
Audi. Koekemoer said he made a fuse which would take about six minutes
to burn, extending from the boot to between the front seats. He told the
men that once the fuse was set, the burning would be visible from
outside the car.
<P>
Further explosives and pieces of iron were packed close to the car's
petrol tank. Koekemoer said Barnard, who was in charge, wanted to set
the car bomb off at a taxi rank in central Johannesburg. Barnard and
Myburgh were to drive the Audi, while Le Roux drove ahead to warn of
police road blocks.
<P>
Koekemoer told the court that after he had built the first car bomb, the
three men who had delivered the bomb to its target, Clifton Barnard,
Abraham Fourie and Etienne le Roux, had returned to the game farm. There
they had told Koekemoer that they had heard the explosion and "had felt
an enormous tremor" when they stopped at a red traffic light some
distance away.
<P>
Barnard had then instructed him to build a second bomb, Koekemoer said.
Barnard also mentioned that he would tell the owner of the Audi car used
in the first blast to report it as stolen.
<P>
Koekemoer said Barnard had told him that the explosives, fuses and
detonators for the second bomb had been provided by accused Cornelius
Botha senior, who had obtained them from the Mooinooi mine.
<P>
Koekemoer built the second bomb in a white trailer, which he was told
belonged to AWB leader Eugene Terre'Blanche.
<P>
It consisted of a 19 kg gas cylinder, 40 sticks of Watergel plastic
explosive sticks and a mixture of Anfax explosive and diesel fuel which
was poured over the top.
<P>
Accused Jan de Wet and Abraham Vlok then drove a red Nissan Skyline to
Germiston with the trailer attached. Accused Johan du Plessis and
Etienne le Roux accompanied them in another car, he said.
<P>
Koekemoer said he was "shocked" when he heard later that people had been
killed in the blast. However, he said Barnard and Le Roux sounded
cheerful about it, "and I fell in with them."
<P>
That afternoon they went to the game farm in the Koster district.
Koekemoer said AWB members had watched the 8pm newscast on television,
and had cheered when they saw the newscast.
<P>

During his evidence, Koekemoer alleged that he had been a police
nformer from the beginning. He told the court that he had joined the
AWB on the instructions of his employers, the police security branch.
<p>        
Despite this he had built several bombs for the AWB, he said, denying
defense accusations that he had acted on orders from a "third force"
within the police.
<P>
Koekemoer admitted that without his expertise gained as a blaster on the
mines, the bombs "would probably not have been built." Defense advocate
Louisa van der Walt put it to him that he had built the bombs on orders
from the police, and this was why he had made no attempt to contact the
police while at the farm.
<P>
She said the bombs had been built on orders from the police to commit
acts of terror as part of a "Third Force". In so doing they had
"attempted to discredit the AWB, to create chaos and to sow the seeds of
a fear psychosis so that the elections would fail." Koekemoer strongly
denied all the allegations.
<P>
He said that his last instructions from his handler was that if his life
was in danger, he should act to protect himself.
<P>
He felt that if he had not complied with the request to build the bombs,
his life would have been in danger. He had been told that if anyone
"turned" that would be the end of that person.
<P>
On joining the Ystergarde he had taken the oath expected of every
member:`if I should turn, shoot me' he said. Van der Walt put it to him
that "this oath meant nothing to him as he had already spied on his own
people."
<P>
Koekemoer said he had "tried to build faults in the bomb," but was told
that if it did not work, he "would be in trouble." He said he had made
the bombs out of fear for his own life.
<P>
He admitted he had made the pipe bombs safer for the people who were
handling them, by replacing rapid burning cortex fuse with a detonator
fuse. The cortex fuse burns at 8 000m per second.
<P>
This admission brought an admonishment from the judge, Justice Flemming,
who remarked to Koekemoer that "you made it safer for the man throwing
it, but thought nothing of the 20 or 40 people who would be on the
receiving end."
<P>
Koekemoer said he planned to contact his handlers, but was afraid to use
the party telephone line at the farm in case other people were listening
in. He had not attempted to escape from the farm because he thought he
might be caught by AWB patrols. "I knew it was wrong and a mistake on my
part, but in the situation I feared for my life," he said.
<P>
This line of argument however fell to pieces when Koekemoer admitted
that he had made the "corrections" to the pipe bombs while all alone on
a farm near Krugersdorp the weekend before the elections.
<P>
At the farm he had access to two way radios, and had still not used them
to contact the police, never mind having been left alone with the bombs
for a whole day.
<P>
Koekemoer also alleged that a bomb large enough to "lower airplanes
from the sky" was initially intended to be used by the AWB to bomb
either the Union Buildings in Pretoria or Jan Smuts airport.
<P>
He said a smaller bomb destined for Jan Smuts airport was eventually
built in a Peugeot car because accused Clifton Barnard had been unable
to obtain a petrol tanker in which the larger bomb would have been
built.
<P>
The car used in the Bree Street, Johannesburg, bombing of 24 April
1994, was in the possession of one of the AWB members standing trial,
the court was told by one of the state witnesses, Barend Breytenbach, of
Ventersdorp.
<P>
Breytenbach told the court that the car, a green Audi, had belonged to
his father, Marthinus Breytenbach. His father had died in January 1995.
<P>
He said his father had lent the car to one of the accused, Clifton
Barnard, on Friday 22 April 1994. On Saturday 23 April he and his father
drove through Ventersdorp in a minibus they had been lent in exchange
for the Audi, and saw Barnard standing next to the Audi outside the AWB
headquarters.
<P>
Barnard had told them they could only get the vehicle back `later' and
they had gone home, he testified.
<P>
On Sunday 24 April, they drove to Barnard's farm 15 km outside
Ventersdorp, but Barnard was not there. After they had spent the day
having a barbecue and riding horses, Barnard had eventually returned
late that afternoon in a brown Toyota Corolla car.
<P>
Breytenbach's younger brother, Rudolf, then testified that on Barnard's
return, when his father had asked Barnard what had become of the Audi,
Barnard had motioned him aside. Rudolf overheard Barnard tell his father
that the car was a "wreck" and described his father as being very upset.
<P>
When they returned home, they found a note under their front door,
apparently from Barnard, requesting his father to meet Barnard at
"headquarters." Later his father and Barnard's mother told him and his
brother not "to say anything about what they had seen or heard."
<P>
Breytenbach said the car was never returned to them. The court had heard
earlier that it had been reported stolen to the police at 6pm on Sunday
24 April.
<P>
Another witness, a Black man named Abraham Kujani, told the court that
he had seen two White men driving an Audi and park it in Bree Street on
the Sunday morning shortly before the bomb went off.
<P>
Kujani described the driver of the Audi as being tall, with blonde hair
and a beard. He was carrying a firearm. Kujani said he became suspicious
of the car on seeing smoke coming from the inside. He noticed two
policemen at a cafe across the road and then attempted to follow the
men, but lost sight of them.
<P>
One of the accused was apprehended in a road block on 26 April 1994 in
a car containing two pipe bombs, according to policemen doing duty at a
road block on that day.
<P>
The court heard that accused Johannes Olivier, 40, of the farm
Leafontein in the Boons district, had chased through a roadblock on Main
Reef Road, near Benoni, on the evening of 26 April.
<P>
State witness FG Wolmarans, who was doing a national service camp with
the Benoni army commando, said he had been stationed with three others
about 800 m from the main roadblock. They had been told to be on the
lookout for a white Ford Cortina.
<P>
At 9.40pm he noticed a car fitting the description come round the
corner. The car stopped about 20 m away from them and he noticed an
object being thrown out the passenger door. As they approached the car,
he saw two White men sitting in front. It began driving slowly towards
the main roadblock.
<P>
They radioed back to the main road block, who had told them that the car
had sped through at high speed and traffic officers were in pursuit.
<P>
A Benoni traffic officer, Hendrik Janse van Rensburg, then testified how
he and a colleague had pursued the Cortina to First Avenue, Northmead,
where the occupants got out of the car and attempted to escape. During
the chase, they heard several shots fired from the Cortina. He and his
fellow officer pursued Olivier on foot, and apprehended him.
<P>
Major Lionel Palmer, of the Benoni Crime Intelligence Service, said he
found a pipe bomb in the boot of the car after questioning Olivier, who
said he was the owner of the car. The object thrown out of the car was
also a pipe bomb.
<P>
Olivier told him that he and his companion had identified a target in
Boksburg frequented by Blacks where they would use the smaller of the
pipe bombs, and were on their way to Benoni to identify a second target
where the larger of the two bombs would be used.
<P>
Doppies Treurnicht, the man who was in the vehicle who got out and ran
away, was arrested after nearly a year on the run in the West Coast town
of Port Nolloth in March 1995.
<P>
Treurnicht, who was widely expected to join the accused, made a surprise
appearance as a state witness instead, although it turned out that his
evidence was not of such great value to the state as the prosecutors had
originally hoped.
<P>
Treurnicht testified that he was in a car with accused Johannes Olivier,
which was stopped in a road block on the way to the East Rand town of
Benoni on the evening of 26 April 1994.
<P>
He said the car contained two pipe bombs, one in the car and one in the
boot. Another car with other AWB men had been following them, he said.
<P>
Treurnicht said that when he saw the road block he instructed Olivier to
pull over to the side of the road. He had then thrown the pipe bomb in
the car out of the window.
<P>
They had then sped through the road block. He had fired several shots
into the road with his own firearm, but denied that he had fired shots
at the police.
<P>
Treurnicht said he was only able to identify Olivier, and one other
accused, Milestone Sharp, as having been on the game farm at Rustenburg
where the police had swooped on the AWB camp. He said Sharp had asked
him and Olivier when the came off guard duty at the camp's shooting
range if either of them "knew Benoni."
<P>
Treurnicht said he was unable to identify the other people who had
followed the vehicle in which he had traveled and that he could not
identify the person who had demonstrated how the pipe bombs had worked.
<P>
Treurnicht also denied ever having seen another state witness, Jacob
Koekemoer, whom the state alleged actually made the bombs.
<P>
AWB turncoat Barend Honiball testified in court that he had been part
of a group of AWB men gathered on a game farm in the Western Transvaal
where he had seen pipe bombs being handled.
<P>
He said two of the men, accused Jan Kruger, 20, and Johan du
Plessis, had given the men "instructions on how to steal cars."
<P>
Further he had been present when a red Nissan Skyline had arrived at the
farm, driven by Ystergarde leader Leon van der Merwe. Honiball and other
members were told to off load several pipe bombs from the boot of the
car.
<P>
He said he had first heard about the Bree Street bomb when he saw a
newspaper report. Another one of the accused, Clint Entlish, had then
told him that "this is only the start, there are still lots to come."
<P>
Honiball said Du Plessis and accused Gert Fourie had asked for
volunteers amongst the men who had cars, to target various places where
the pipe bombs could be thrown.
<P>
He said he went to see the police a half hour after being dropped off by
other AWB members in Pretoria a few days later.
<P>

One of the police officers investigating the bombings told the court
that a metal plate with a serial number from a trailer had been found on
the farm where the bombs were allegedly manufactured.
<P>
The court had heard earlier that the bomb which exploded at a Germiston
taxi rank on 25 April had been detonated in a trailer.
<P>
Warrant Officer G Pitout said he went to search the farm Koesterfontein
in Magaliesburg, where the bomb had allegedly been made. The farm is
owned by the father of one of the accused, Abraham Myburgh.
<P>
Pitout said he had found the metal plate in an uninhabited building. The
serial number belonged to a trailer registered in the name of AWB
leader, Eugene Terre'Blanche.
<P>
State witness Lizanne Kuhrau testified before the court that one of
the accused, Jaco Nel, had come to stay with her at the Oewers holiday
resort near Brits on 26 April 1994, "worried that the police were
looking for him."
<P>
Kuhrau, who was estranged from her husband at the time, said two other
accused, Petrus Steyn, 34 of Sundra, and Gert Fourie, 37, of Springs,
had accompanied Nel when he came to see her at her friend's flat in
Sunnyside, Pretoria, on the morning of 25 April.
<P>
They had left the flat in her friend's car, a blue Citi Golf, and
returned later that day. On the afternoon of 26 April, Nel arrived at
the resort with three other men. She identified one as Johannes Smit,
26, of Vereniging.
<P>
Nel told her he had heard a report on the radio saying the police were
looking for a blue car in connection with a bomb explosion in
Marabastad, Pretoria, on the night of 25 April.
<P>
He was worried that the police were looking for him and asked if he
could spend the night. She agreed and the other three men had left.
<P>
Kuhrau, who has since reconciled with her husband, said she made a
statement to the police on 21 July 1994. She denied that she had made
the report because her relationship with Nel had failed.
<P>
She said Nel had asked her to make a false statement saying she had been
with him from 10am on 25 April until the following day. Defense advocate
Harry Prinsloo said Nel would deny this.
<P>
AWB turncoat Dawid Potgieter testified in court how he and two others
had bombed a taxi rank in Westonaria on 25 April 1994. He said he had
been amongst those gathered at a game farm in the Koster district for
several days before the elections. 
<P>
Accused Johan du Plessis, 26, had asked for volunteers, he testified. He
required four men with cars, and another eight men as passengers to set
off pipe bombs in various areas. Potgieter said he was chosen to
accompany Martin Wiebosch and accused Jan Kruger, 20, to set off a bomb
in Westonaria. Wiebosch was not one the accused and also gave evidence
for the state.
<P>
Potgieter said they had left the farm early on 25 April. They surveyed
several possible targets, including a taxi rank at Westonaria, the train
station and the mine, before deciding to bomb a taxi rank on the way to
Carletonville. At about 8am they threw the ignited pipe bomb in the
direction of the taxi rank, where it landed under one of the vehicles.
<P>
Potgieter said he saw someone pick up the pipe bomb, and put it down
again, warning other bystanders. People then scattered as the bomb went
off. Potgieter said he later reported to AWB commandant Abraham Fourie
that the bomb had gone off successfully, but that he did not know if
anyone had been killed.
<P>
A statement which formed a crucial part of the state's case against
several of the AWB men was ruled inadmissible by the presiding judge,
HCJ Flemming, after a "trial within a trial" over the admissibility of
the statement and another two state documents.
<P>
One of the last state witnesses was the investigating officer in the
Bree Street bomb blast, captain Jacobus Terblanche. The defense put it
to captain Terblanche that another police captain, Nick Deetleefs and
state witness Jacobus Koekemoer had "colluded in making Mr. Koekemoer's
statement." (It was Koekemoer's evidence earlier in the trial which was
the most damaging to the defense.)
<P>
Terblanche conceded under cross examination that it was "possible" that
the statement could have been interfered with.
<P>
A Colonel Nick Engelbrecht also testified that he had taken a statement
from one of the accused, Jannie Kruger in May 1984. Kruger  had been
arrested along with another accused, Josais Cruywagen, and both had
allegedly made statements. The defense however contested the
admissibility of the statements, arguing that they had been filed in
without either of the two accused' knowledge or permission.
<P>
Engelbrecht said Kruger had made his statement freely and voluntarily,
and had not insisted on a legal representative being present even though
he had been advised that he could have one if he so wished.
<P>

The defense team put it to Engelbrecht that he and his team were "in a
quandary" and desperate for statements after the legal counsel of the
men arrested at the shooting range near Rustenburg on 27 April had
advised the men there not to make any statements.
<P>
The defense put it to Engelbrecht that part of the statement he had
taken from Kruger had been completed in his absence. Engelbrecht denied
this. The defense then asked him why if it were true that Engelbrecht
had not asked Kruger any questions, save for gaining clarification on
the events he allegedly described, Kruger had known that he had to begin
the statement by supplying details of his schooling and occupational
training.
<P>
Kruger himself testified that the police had told him that if he refused
to become a state witness, he would most certainly get the death
penalty. He said at first he refused to make a statement but had been
told that he would enjoy protection as a witness for the state, a car,
accommodation, a job and "compensation."
<P>
When he got to police head quarters in Johannesburg, he was taken to
Engelbrecht's offices in Germiston where he made a statement. On his way
to court for a bail application on 23 May 1993, he said Engelbrecht had
approached him with a statement on which he had marked with crosses the
places where Kruger was required to sign.
<P>
He said he had signed the statement after being told that was a form
from the attorney general's office which he was obliged to sign as a
state witness. He had however been charged along with the other accused
in the case.
<P>
The statement which Engelbrecht had drawn up and which Kruger had been
shown unsigned and asked to sign was now the one that the state was
trying to submit as evidence, the defense said.
<P>
Finally on 6 April 1995 Justice Flemming ruled that Kruger had had
little choice in making a statement "as he had virtually been placed
between the devil and the deep blue sea."
<P>
He said the reasons police gave as to why they did not give Kruger the
option of making the statement before a magistrate were unconvincing.
Police had testified that it was "too early" to get a magistrate in
before whom a statement could be made.
<P>
"One wonders why, after he was given legal advice to the contrary, the
accused would suddenly have been prepared to make a statement," Flemming
continued.
<P>
He said that from the content of Kruger's evidence and on the balance of
probabilities, it could not be said that he was not speaking the truth"
and that therefore the alleged statement was not admissible.
<P>
(The statement made by Kruger was to the effect that he had personally
driven the car bomb used in the attack on Jan Smuts airport, and that he
had been injured in the resultant blast when he had not been able to get
away in time. He had then walked back to Ventersdorp - a distance of
over 140 kilometers - over two days, spending nights in the veld, with a
head wound. He had then been sent down to the Eastern Cape by the AWB to
hide from the police, but he had been identified by the state witness
Koekemoer and was eventually arrested.)
<P>
The new interim constitution of South Africa contained a clause which
compelled the newly elected government to grant amnesty for political
crimes committed before 5 December 1993. As the election time bombings
fell outside this date, the AWB took it upon itself to try and get this
date extended to 10 May 1994 - the date of the swearing in of Nelson
Mandela as president of South Africa. To this purpose the AWB leader
appointed his media secretary, Fred Rundle to the post of "Chief
Negotiator" and instructed him to make submissions to the ANC Minister
of Justice, Dullah Omar, and Mandela to try and get the amnesty cut off
date extended.
<P>
After several written submissions and a meeting between Rundle and Omar,
an invitation was extended to the AWB to address the parliamentary
Standing Committee on Justice in Cape Town on the issue. Despite all
these efforts, the ANC dominated government decided against extending
the deadline.
<P>
This refusal to consider the AWB men for inclusion under the amnesty law
provoked an immediate response - four of the main accused- Clifton
Barnard, Etienne le Roux, Abraham Myburgh and Jan de Wet (the first
three were accused of planting the Bree Street bomb, while De Wet was
accused of planting the Germiston bomb) skipped bail on Wednesday 12
April 1995 and went underground.
<P>
On that day the four men failed to appear in court along with the other
accused in the case and warrants were issued for their arrest. Their
bail of R50 000 each was declared forfeit to the state.
<P>
Their attempt at escaping was however short lived, as they were
rearrested at a police road block between Piet Retief and Pongola on the
Natal / Swaziland border on 19 April 1995.
<P>
Although the police claimed the four men were arrested at a "routine"
road block, this appears most certainly to be an invented story to cover
<P>
for the fact that the AWB men were betrayed at some point in their
travels.
<P>
The police said that the four men were recognized "by chance" by one of
the men manning the road block "who happened to have been part of the
original arrest team" in the Transvaal.
<P>
The chances of a policeman working a roadblock in Northern Natal having
been one of the original arrest team is of course extremely slim, and it
is far more likely that the arrest team officers were brought down to
Natal especially for the road block prior to it being set up, so that
there would be people present who could identify the AWB men. All this
would indicate that the road block had been set up precisely for the
purpose of arresting the men following on information that they would be
travelling that particular road.
<P>
The driver of the pick up in which the four men were travelling, was
released by police virtually immediately afterwards, after apparently
claiming that he did not know to who he was giving a lift. This story is
of course also extremely dubious.
<P>
The four men re-applied for bail once they were back in Johannesburg,
and to no-one's great surprise, the request was refused.
<P>
The state then closed its case and the defense team immediately
requested the Court to discharge on all counts 16 of the 26 accused in
the case.
<P>
The defense team submitted that the following accused should be
discharged on all counts as the state had failed to produce any evidence
linking them to any of the incidents: Nico Prinsloo; Leon van der Merwe;
Abraham Fourie; his brother Gert Fourie; Hercules Coetzee; his brother
Andreas Coetzee; Cornelius Botha; his son Cornelius Botha junior; Gert
Alberts; Milestone Sharp; Serge D'Abbadie; Dirk Meyer; Johannes Smit;
Clint Entlish; Petrus Steyn; and Johan Du Plessis.
<P>
The defense also argued that there was no evidence of the involvement of
Etienne le Roux; Cliff Barnard; and Jan de Wet in the Randfontein,
Westonaria, Pretoria and Jan Smuts airport bomb blasts, and that charges
against them relating to these incidents should also be dismissed.
<P>
The defense further argued that there was no evidence against Jan de Wet
in the Bree Street bombing incident, and that this charge against him
should be dismissed. The defense further applied for the discharge of
accused Jaco Nel on all counts except the Pretoria bomb.
<P>
This plea was only partially met - seven of the accused were cleared on
all counts except for the illegal possession of firearms and explosives,
while another one was discharged on all counts except the illegal
possession of firearms and explosives charges and one charge of car
theft.
<P>
Etienne le Roux, Cliff Barnard, Abraham Myburgh and Jan de Wet, remained
charged with all 96 counts, which included all the murder charges.
Abraham Fourie, Johannes Venter and Johan du Plessis had all charges
except those relating to the Bree Street, Germiston and Jan Smuts car
bombings withdrawn.
<P>
Justice Flemming said the state had failed to prove that there was a
conspiracy to commit deeds of terror to disrupt the elections. He said
it was "not unthinkable" that among the AWB members gathered at the
farm, there was a "relatively innocent group" who only knew about the
pipe bombs.
<P>
The judge said the Bree Street, Germiston and Jan Smuts car bombs had
all been built on the farm Koesterfontein. There was no technical reason
why they could not have been built on the game farm. It could be that
the building of the car bombs was done in such a way as to prevent the
people at the game farm from knowing about them.
<P>
Aside from the evidence of state witness Koekemoer who was an accomplice
as well as a witness, there was very little evidence about what went on
at Koesterfontein.
<P>
The judge described Koekemoer as "not only an unconvincing but also a
very poor witness" whose evidence could not be accepted by a court
"without reasonable doubt."
<P>
The case was then postponed to September 1995 in order to give time to
the defense to prepare their case. However, when the case was restarted
it was once again postponed to 12 February 1996, pending the outcome of
a case in the then newly established constitutional court. The issue at
stake was whether it was fair to charge everyone present at the shooting
range with possession of the firearms and ammunition when they all
denied knowledge of the items and no one particular person was found to
be in possession of them.

<center><h3>Postscript</h3></center>
<P>
On 5 November 1994, Johan Heyns, a prominent Afrikaner theologian and
former moderator of the biggest Afrikaans church, NG Church, was
assassinated in his Pretoria home while playing with his grandchildren.
Heyns was the key man in turning the Afrikaners around against Apartheid
through their church by getting their main church to declare Apartheid a
heresy. This was a direct turnaround from the church's earlier position
which had endorsed Apartheid.

<P>
As the Afrikaners are to this day extremely attached to their church and
religion, there can be little doubt that this shift by the NG Church did
much to persuade Afrikaners to continue supporting the National Party's
reform policies. As such, Heyns fast became one of the most hated men
amongst the right wing.
<P>
In April 1995 police discovered three large arms caches which they later
linked to AWB fugitive and former Reconnaissance army unit soldier Thys
de Villiers. De Villiers eventually arrested in June 1995, and although
the police initially suggested that he would be charged with the Heyns'
assassination, they later had to admit that they did not have enough
evidence against him to press that charge.
<P>
De Villiers was however charged with a number of murders, including that
of an alleged police informant and some ANC members south of
Johannesburg.
<P>

<H1>Pat Buchanan Stuns Establishment</H1>

<p><em>by Don Black</em></center>


<p>Pat Buchanan has stunned the political and media Establishment with his victory in New Hampshire's presidential primary. Four years ago, his quixotic presidential bid was tolerated as a useful foil to the short-lived David Duke campaign. Now,  however, as Rabbi Avi Weiss shrieks in today's <em>Palm Beach Jewish Journal</em>, he's "an anti-Semite out of control."

<p>The Buchanan campaign has been discussed at some length on the Stormfront-L mailing list over the past six months, with some posters enthusiastically supporting Buchanan, while others believe he's just another Establishment shill. Regardless of his underlying philosophy and motives, however, Buchanan is now shaking the <em>status quo</em> to its core.

<p>I first noticed Buchanan in 1982, when he described the black riots in Washington, D.C. which followed an aborted Klan demonstration I had originally organized. The anticipated KKK march had created so much consternation among federal authorities that the Supreme Court had actually moved up an appeal I had filed challenging my previous conviction for violating the Neutrality Act. The Court denied <em>certiori</em> and I was ordered to report to a Mexican-dominated prison in Texas, rather than lead a demonstration in opposition to illegal Mexican immigration in the nation's capital. Though some Klansmen still showed up, the march was cancelled. The real story was the aftermath, which the national media portrayed as righteous indignation to Klan "hatred." Buchanan, however,  told the truth,  "When it comes to hatred, to violence, to racism, the Knights of the KKK can't hold a candle to the thuggish and criminal elements in the black community in Washington, D.C." Hmmm....

<p>After that, his columns and comments on CNN's <em>Crossfire</em> become a refreshing alternative to the "mainstream" media's usual drivel. He railed against "affirmative action" and other anti-White programs long before it was fashionable to do so. He decried the pernicious affects of Third World immigration on the city and the country where he grew up. Against his fellow conservatives' multi-nationalism and interventionism, he stood up for an America First foreign policy. He called Capitol Hill "Israeli occupied territory." When opinion polls were giving George Bush a ninety percent approval rating for his planned intervention in the Persian Gulf, Buchanan wrote, "There are only two groups beating the drums for war in the Middle East--the Israeli Defense Ministry and its amen corner in the U.S." And then, in a comment that Jews seem particularly sensitive to,  he said the war would be fought by "kids with names like McAllister, Murphy, Gonzales and Leroy Brown."

<p>In 1987 he spoke out against the impending deportation of Karl Linnas to the U.S.S.R., whom the Soviets has accused of "Nazi war crimes" in Estonia. He lost that battle. Linnas was deported by the U.S. and summarily executed by the Soviets. He then became the champion of retired Cleveland auto worker John Demjanjuk, whom Israel was accusing of "war crimes." Demjanjuk was extradited to Israel and, after a show trial held in a movie theater, sentenced to hang. Buchanan was vindicated this time, though, when the Israeli Supreme Court was forced to release Demjanjuk when new evidence was released by the Russians after the collapse of the U.S.S.R.

<p>Then Buchanan announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president in 1992 against George Bush, who was then considered unbeatable. Considering his previous statements, he was treated surprisingly gently by the media and other politicians. Since David Duke was also running in some Republican presidential primaries, many Duke supporters believed Buchanan's sole purpose was to siphon votes from the less "respectable" Duke. Whatever his motives,  he certainly undermined the Duke candidacy. During the latter part of his flagging campaign, he would crow at every fundraising gathering about having "buried David Duke in the bayou."

<p>With Duke now back in a U.S. Senate race, and with the Establishment's handpicked presidential candidate Bob Dole now wounded, "Loose Cannon" Buchanan, as some of his detractors have started calling him, now poses a  real threat. We can expect some real fireworks in the next few months.

<p>I can remember the outrage and panic in 1980 when Texas' former governor John Connally announced he would run for president. Connally had done no more than call America a "Christian nation" and suggest that Israel withdraw from the West Bank. One columnist in a major Jewish newspaper responded by implying that Connally should be assassinated if he should come "anywhere near" the White House. The media used Connally's own wheeler-dealer image to qucikly put an end to his candidacy, and then federal authorities tried to ensure he would never again pose a threat by indicting him on fabricated criminal charges, which he would later beat. (In an ironic twist, the Texas oilman who was his principal campaign fundraiser would be convicted on trumped up racketeering charges and would become my prison roommate and a close friend in 1984.)  

<p>Unlike Connally, Buchanan's populist message resonates with White working people. They know from personal experience that NAFTA and GATT, and exporting jobs to Mexico, are not in their best interests. As this "transition to a global economy" causes their incomes to continue to decline, they become even angrier about paying higher taxes to support a welfare underclass. They've experienced the anti-White racism called "affirmative action." They've seen many parts of their country turned into Third World cesspools because of the government's immigartion policy.  Pat Buchanan's campaign will continue its phenomenol growth because he is the only candidate taking their side.

<p>Despite Buchanan's courageous statements and despite the hatred he has engendered from our enemies, should we consider him one of us? Is he a White Nationalist? Well...not exactly. Buchanan's worldview is rooted in his traditional Catholic background. This accounts for his love of Western culture and his sense of justice, and his willingness to fight the enemies of these, whether they be America-last Zionists or Third World immigrants. This doesn't mean he's racially conscious. He apparently doesn't fully appreciate the central importance of race in the "culture war" he talks about. His sister Bay seems to be even more oblivous to the concept of Race, and she seems to be a major influence on her brother.

<p>Should we support him? In my opinion, yes. My first priority this election year is the David Duke Senate campaign. David does understand the real issues. But for those who want to be part of a national campaign, this is one worth considering. 

<p>Will Buchanan support us? No, of course not, though I suspect he will be forced to adopt a more tolerant attitude toward supporters who are members or former members of racialist organizations. There are just too many of them and the media would love to spend the rest of the campaign finding them. He can not be expected to embrace us,  however. He's no longer exhorting from the sidelines; he wants to be president. Nevertheless, I believe  that he is a trailblazer. He will make White Americans more aware of the real issues and of  their real enemies, and he will pave the way for other,  more racially oriented, candidates at all levels.

I suspect few government officials realized in 1992 the widespread anger
and resentment their actions in a remote area of Idaho would inspire.
Randy Weaver and his family were just some more "troublemakers" who
didn't like the multicultural cesspool and wanted to be left alone. They
would be "taken down hard and fast."<p>

While most of the American sheeple paid no attention to this atrocity, a
substantial minority on both sides of the political spectrum were
outraged and wouldn't forget. Now the story continues.<p>

Please note that, damning as the Justice Department
<a TARGET="_top" href="http://www.counsel.com/ruby/ruby1.htm">investigation</a>
is, FBI officials are now believed to have destroyed evidence to keep it
away from investigators.<p>

<b>Ruby Ridge: The Justice Report</b><p>

<i>By James Bovard</i><p>

The 1992 confrontation between federal agents and the Randy Weaver
family in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, has become one of the most controversial
and widely discussed examples of the abuse of federal power. The Justice
Department completed a 542-page investigation on the case last year but
has not yet made the report public. However, the report was acquired by
Legal Times newspaper, which this week placed the text on the Internet.
The report reveals that federal officials may have acted worse than even
some of their harshest critics imagined.<p>

This case began after Randy Weaver was entrapped, as an Idaho jury
concluded, by an undercover Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms agent
to sell him sawed-off shotguns.<p>

While federal officials have claimed that the violent confrontation
between the Weavers and the government began when the Weavers ambushed
federal marshals, the report tells a very different story. A team of six
U.S. marshals, split into two groups, trespassed onto Mr. Weaver's land
on Aug. 21, 1992. One of the marshals threw rocks at the Weaver's cabin
to see how much noise was required to agitate the Weaver's dogs. A few
minutes later, Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris, and 13-year-old Sammy Weaver
came out of the cabin and began following their dogs. Three U.S.
marshals were soon tearing through the woods.<p>

At one point, U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper "told the others that it was
['expletive deleted'] for them to continue running and that he did not
want to 'run down the trail and get shot in the back.' He urged them to
take up defensive positions. The others agreed.... William Degan ...
took a position behind a stump...."<p>

As Sammy Weaver and Kevin Harris came upon the marshals, gunfire
erupted. Sammy was shot in the back and killed while running away from
the scene (probably by Marshal Cooper, according to the report), and
Marshal Degan was killed by Mr. Harris. The jury concluded that Mr.
Harris's action was legitimate self-defense; the Justice report
concluded it was impossible to know who shot first.<p>

Several places in the report deal with the possibility of a government
coverup. After the firefight between the marshals and the Weavers and
Mr. Harris, the surviving marshals were taken away to rest and
recuperate. The report observed, "We question the wisdom of keeping the
marshals together at the condominium for several hours, while awaiting
interviews with the FBI. Isolating them in that manner created the
appearance and generated allegations that they were fabricating stories
and colluding to cover up the true circumstances of the shootings."<p>

After the death of the U.S. marshal, the FBI was called in. A source of
continuing fierce debate across America is: Did the FBI set out to
apprehend and arrest Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris -- or simply to kill
them? Unfortunately, the evidence from the Justice Department report is
damning in the extreme on this count.<p>

The report noted, "We have been told by observers on the scene that law
enforcement personnel made statements that the matter would be handled
quickly and that the situation would be 'taken down hard and fast.' "
The FBI issued Rules of Engagement that declared that its snipers "can
and should" use deadly force against armed males outside the cabin.<p>

The report noted that a member of an FBI SWAT team from Denver
"remembered the Rules of Engagement as 'if you see 'em, shoot 'em.' "
The task force report noted, "since those Rules which contained 'should'
remained in force at the crisis scene for days after the August 22
shooting, it is inconceivable to us that FBI Headquarters remained
ignorant of the exact wording of the Rules of Engagement during that
entire period."<p>

The report concluded that the FBI Rules of Engagement at Ruby Ridge
flagrantly violated the U.S. Constitution: "The Constitution allows no
person to become 'fair game' for deadly force without law enforcement
evaluating the threat that person poses, even when, as occurred here,
the evaluation must be made in a split second." The report portrays the
rules of engagement as practically a license to kill: "The Constitution
places the decision on whether to use deadly force on the individual
agent; the Rules attempted to usurp this responsibility."<p>

FBI headquarters rejected an initial operation plan because there was no
provision to even attempt to negotiate the surrender of the suspects.
The plan was revised to include a negotiation provision -- but
subsequent FBI action made that provision a nullity. FBI snipers took
their positions around the Weaver cabin a few minutes after 5 p.m. on
Aug. 22. Within an hour, every adult in the cabin was either dead or
severely wounded -- even though they had not fired a shot at any FBI
agent.<p>

Randy Weaver, Mr. Harris, and 16-year-old Sara Weaver stepped out of the
cabin a few minutes before 6 p.m. to go to the shed where Sammy's body
lay. FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi shot Randy Weaver in the back. As Randy
Weaver, Mr. Harris, and Sara Weaver struggled to get back into the
cabin, Vicki Weaver stood in the cabin doorway holding a baby. Agent
Horiuchi fired again; his bullet passed through a window in the door,
hit Vicki Weaver in the head, killing her instantly, and then hit Mr.
Harris in the chest.<p>

At the subsequent trial, the government claimed that Messrs. Weaver and
Harris were shot because they had threatened to shoot at a helicopter
containing FBI officials. Because of insufficient evidence, the federal
judge threw out the charge that Messrs. Weaver and Harris threatened the
helicopter. The Justice report noted, "The SIOC [Strategic Information
and Operations Center at FBI headquarters] Log indicates that shots were
fired during the events of August 22.... We have found no evidence
during this inquiry that shots fired at any helicopter during the Ruby
Ridge crisis. The erroneous entry was never corrected." (The Idaho jury
found Messrs. Weaver and Harris innocent on almost all charges.)<p>

The Justice Department task force expressed grave doubts about the
wisdom of the FBI strategy: "From information received at the Marshals
Service, FBI management had reason to believe that the Weaver/Harris
group would respond to a helicopter in the vicinity of the cabin by
coming outside with firearms. Notwithstanding this knowledge, they
placed sniper/observers on the adjacent mountainside with instructions
that they could and should shoot armed members of the group, if they
came out of the cabin. Their use of the helicopter near the cabin
invited an accusation that the helicopter was intentionally used to draw
the Weaver group out of the cabin."<p>

The task force was extremely critical of Agent Horiuchi's second shot:
"Since the exchange of gunfire [the previous day], no one at the cabin
had fired a shot. Indeed, they had not even returned fire in response to
Horiuchi's first shot. Furthermore, at the time of the second shot,
Harris and others outside the cabin were retreating, not attacking. They
were not retreating to an area where they would present a danger to the
public at large...."<p>

Regarding Agent Horiuchi's killing of Vicki Weaver, the task force
concluded, "[B]y fixing his cross hairs on the door when he believed
someone was behind it, he placed the children and Vicki Weaver at risk,
in violation of even the special Rules of Engagement.... In our opinion
he needlessly and unjustifiably endangered the persons whom he thought
might be behind the door."<p>

The Justice Department task force was especially appalled that the
adults were gunned down before receiving any warning or demand to
surrender: "While the operational plan included a provision for a
surrender demand, that demand was not made until after the shootings....
The lack of a planned 'call out' as the sniper/observers deployed is
significant because the Weavers were known to leave the cabin armed when
vehicles or airplanes approached. The absence of such a plan subjected
the Government to charges that it was setting Weaver up for attack."<p>

<H2>George Bush and the NRA</H2>

<P><B>by Yggdrasil</B></P>

<P> Poor, dumb George never did get it!</P>

<P> He joined the National Rifle Association years ago for reasons of political
expediency. He never really did believe in the cause. Poor old George never
could understand the fears of the Founding Fathers that our government
might turn into tyranny.</P>

<P> So once the NRA published an ad portraying ATF agents as jackbooted
invaders, he resigns to display his patrician, East Coast &quot;moral superiority&quot;.</P>

<P> You see George is one of those WW-2 vet Republicans who believes that
government is the sainted defender of all things good, and that all government
employees are well meaning people doing a wonderful job. So lost in the
fog of the &quot;Good War&quot; is George, that he ignores reality.</P>

<P> Ask George how one of his sainted FBI snipers could see Vickie Weaver
come to the doorway carrying her baby, place the crosshairs of his scope
over her temple and squeeze the trigger. Just another day in the life of
a well meaning government employee rescuing the world from tyranny, right
George?</P>

<P> George still can't figure out why those of us born after the War are
so angry at his tax increases. During Reagan's term, the Ole Ygg's top
marginal rate was 28%. George's tax hikes applied the infamous phase-outs
of deductions, dependent credits and the base tax rate, raising the Ole
Ygg's top marginal rate to 42%. Clinoccio then hiked it to about 45%.</P>

<P> Bush's taxes were unique in their public deception. The middle class
was left believing that the top marginal rate was a &quot;fair&quot; 32%
when they would be hit with 42% should any of them be so unfortunate as
to succeed. Not only did Bush raise the rates, but he concealed them from
public view.</P>

<P> And what have America's productive citizens received for their money?
To George, it's 50 year old memories of &quot;good intentions&quot; that
count, not the actual results. But the problem is that those of us born
after the &quot;Good War&quot; have eyes and were never issued rose colored
glasses.</P>

<P> What we are buying with our taxes is a rapid slide into Third World
status with runaway immigration, racial quotas, an entrenched welfare culture,
dramatically rising illegitimacy rates, falling SAT scores and finally,
a Treasury department that purchases attack helicopters, armored personnel
carriers and battle tanks for domestic use on those who might be offended
enough by these results to actually do something about it. These purchases
were made on George's watch, not Clinoccio's.</P>

<P> Then George has the gall to say that all Government workers are well-meaning
and that it is unfair for the national Rifle Association to criticize BATF.</P>

<P> The ATF was created years ago to destroy whiskey stills and shoot ridge-running
Southern moonshiners during prohibition. They have been chasing and shooting
rural white boys for at least 2 generations. The ATF has always had a clearly
understood mission as an extension of the Eastern Seaboard's post-civil
war program of Reconstruction in the South. The agency has always done
the bidding of our East Coast elites, controlling the hillbillies and other
white undesirables running around the rural countryside.</P>

<P> Only now, it has branched out into the rural Midwest and West, and
apparently these new objects of ATF attention are not as patient as Southerners
who have experienced the brunt of New England liberalism before.</P>

<P> The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> ran a full page editorial (&quot;Faddish
Justice?, May 2, 1995 p A24) contrasting the treatment meted out to police
handling the Ruby Ridge and Waco affairs with the treatment meted out to
the police who handled Rodney king. In the Journal's words:</P>

<P> <I>&quot;Allowing for the dilemmas of the real world, we seem to have
a double standard today: It says that law enforcement officials can do
what they want with unpopular defendants like religious fanatics and white
supremacists. But in dealing with suspects who might charge racial prejudice,
they have to be careful indeed. Even in the wake of Oklahoma City, we are
about to have the release of a Mario Van Peebles film making the Black
Panthers into entertainment, guns and all.&quot;</I></P>

<P> So what are we to think when these agencies begin arming themselves
against the civilian population with attack helicopters, armored personnel
carriers and tanks?</P>

<P> Indeed there is a double standard. It was on George Bush's watch that
the U.S. Marshals purchased the silencers that they carried up on Ruby
Ridge.</P>

<P> What possible reason could George Bush's beloved and sweet spirited
Federal police forces have for wanting to use a silencer when serving an
arrest warrant if not to kill people without alarming the folks who live
down the road?</P>

<P> Did George Bush sign the requisition order for these silencers?</P>

<P> Was he any more aware of what was going on in his administration than
Reagan?</P>

<P> Did the GSA sign the order under Bush's authority? If so, then why
isn't George Bush in the deepest and most profound sense a Washington Criminal?</P>

<P> At some point, those of us paying George Bush's exorbitant taxes have
to take responsibility for what we are financing! At some point we have
to connect motives with deeds. And with the Federal Government performing
so many evil deeds, at some point we must conclude that those directing
all this activity have evil motives.</P>

<P> Shooting someone by mistake is understandable. But requisitioning silencers
for use in making rural arrests bespeaks premeditation and a view of law
enforcement that is hard to square with any notion of liberty.</P>

<P> All things being equal, the Ole Ygg prefers to finance Federal police
that, when they choose to kill, must do so loudly so that the public knows
what is happening. George Bush and his ATF and GSA obviously had different
ideas.</P>

<P> The sad truth is that the &quot;Good War&quot; has blinded an entire
generation to reality.</P>

<P> The U.S. Government lied then about its involvement in that war just
as it lies now about Waco and Ruby Ridge.</P>

<P> The Ole Ygg's father still believes that Jews were killed in gas chambers
at Dachau, Buchenwald and Dora. He also believes that Nazis made soap and
lampshades out of Jews at Dachau.</P>

<P> While these particulars are acknowledged by Vad Y'shem in Israel to
be false, The U.S. military concocted the story upon liberating the camps
and broadcast pictures of emaciated corpses as supposed gas chamber victims
to the entire world. They did this despite a forensic examination by a
U.S. Army surgeon of hundreds of these corpses, and a finding that all
had died of typhus or similar diseases and malnutrition.</P>

<P> The Government did not tell the World about how, after the German guards
surrendered, they lined them up and then machine gunned to death in violation
of the Geneva conventions. But some troops enjoyed the event so much they
took pictures that survive to this day.</P>

<P> Despite the findings of Army doctors, the U.S. built a &quot;gas chamber&quot;
for tourists at Dachau after the War, where none ever existed before.</P>

<P> Oddly, they undertook this needless and false propaganda onslaught
_after_ the Germans were beaten. Why? Blood lust?</P>

<P> The U.S Government and its allies then imposed a constitution on West
Germany that prevented any German guard who served at one of the camps
from coming forward and denying that there were gas chambers at his camp
on pain of a 5 year jail term for &quot;Holocaust Denial.&quot;</P>

<P> In truth, George Bush's generation lied to itself to justify its own
savagery. They still do. Whether it is the wholesale and sly destruction
of African-Americans with abortion and liberal welfare schemes in our ghettos,
or the unbridled physical aggression against rural whites by Federal police,
George Bush and his World War II generation have learned to ignore Government's
deeds and pretend away the results of its actions.</P>

<P> To them, the ritual of manners and the posturing of high minded motives
are all that count.</P>

<P> In truth, for those of us born after the War, George Bush's reappearance
on the stage for one last patrician morality play is electrifying. The
Ole Ygg finds himself scurrying around to find the misplaced reply envelope
from NRA-ILA. Time for another 200 bucks to the boys in DC with a pair
of eyes who can shoot straight!</P>

<P> Time for 'Ole Ygg to fax his Congressman yet again about the future
mission of OSI once all the German prison guards that U.S. troops did not
murder finally die off. If you think that BATF is dangerous, just wait
till OSI finds a new mission!</P>

<P> Time for 'Ole Ygg to send a cool thou to IHR so that there will be
at least one non-liberal institution that can be trusted to preserve the
story of Western Civilization.</P>

<P> Time for 'Ole Ygg to find that misplaced reply envelope for the Phil
Gramm campaign. Dole has a bad dose of George Bush's disease.</P>

<P> Its the vision thing - World War II destroyed it!</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/barus.gif" HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=468 ALIGN=CENTER></P>

<H2>Oklahoma City Aftermath</H2>

<H4>by Don Black</H4>

<P>Though information about who is responsible for the OKC tragedy is limited,
there can be no question who the short-term beneficiaries will be. Public
outrage and fear are providing just the climate needed to ram through Congress
more repressive legislation and &quot;turn loose&quot; the FBI and BATF.
New gun control and &quot;anti-terrorist&quot; legislation is almost certain
now, empowering Big Brother to conduct warrantless searches and wiretaps
and infiltrate any organization holding politically incorrect views.<BR>
</P>

<P>All the media attention given the families of children crushed in the
bombing contrast sharply with the treatment given the approximately equal
number of children burned to death in Waco two years ago. These children,
victims of BATF criminals looking for a bigger Congressional budget allocation
and FBI agents with a reckless disregard for life, were buried in paupers'
graves.</P>

<P>With the promotion of the Larry Potts, recently censured for his role
in the killing of Randy Weaver's wife and son, to Deputy Director of the
FBI, and with the postponement of planned Congressional hearings on Waco,
the System's intentions have become all too clear. The BATF's current director
now dismisses the slaughter of innocents at Waco as &quot;mistakes&quot;
resulting form &quot;lack of training.&quot; While the rest of us have
to pay for our mistakes and our &quot;lack of training,&quot; federal agents
get promoted.</P>

<P>Though most Americans believed what the media told them about Waco,
a broad segment of the population did not. For the first time since Reconstruction,
millions of Americans have developed an abiding hatred of their own government.
They have concluded that these public servants turned public masters have
gotten out of control and are now willing to murder American citizens who
don't conform.</P>

<P>With our society unraveling, the kind of horror we saw in Oklahoma was
perhaps inevitable. Tragically, the history of the world has often been
characterized by atrocity followed by counter-atrocity. There is little
we can do to prevent this. Our job now as White Nationalists is to educate
our fellow citizens as to the cause of America's decline and build a movement
which will one day create a new nation.</P>

<title>Rabbi Cooper demands Net censorship in Canada</title>

<hr>

While Rabbi Cooper and his Thought Police are having difficulty in the
U.S. overcoming the First Amendment, they seem to be making more
progress in some other countries where such traditions aren't as strong.
The Rabbi is promoting "cooperation among all the world's governments"
in the suppression of ideas and information he finds objectionable.<p>

The following article ran on the Canadian Press Newswire on Wed. June
14.
<hr>

<h4>Regulation needed to stop Internet hate campaigns</h4><p>

<i>By Dianne Rinehart</i><p>

OTTAWA (CP) - An anti-racism group wants the government to regulate the
worldwide computer network under the Broadcast Act.<p>

Simon Wiesenthal Centre representatives say the Internet should be
defined as broadcasting and regulated by the Canadian Radio-television
and Telecommunications Commission.<p>

The CRTC can pull a broadcaster's licence if it airs hate propaganda.<p>

The organization also asked Wednesday for legislation to make promotion
of hatred on computer networks a criminal offence.<p>

"There's a change in the battlefield and a change in the rules of
engagement,'' Rabbi Abraham Cooper of Los Angeles said at a news
conference.<p>

The organization demonstrated the amount of hate and racist literature
available on the net by connecting with such state-of-the-art
information services as:

<ul>
<dl>

<li>Stormfront, published by former Ku Klux Klan member Don
Black.

<li>Resistance Records, put out by Canadian white supremacist George Burdi.

<li>Voice of Freedom, published by Canadian Holocaust-denier Ernst
Zundel.

</ul>
</dl>
<p>

"It's one-stop shopping for white racist revisionist material," said
Rick Eaton, of Los Angeles, as he scrolled through the services which
are set up like magazines with color graphics and content pages listing
articles available.<p>

Also on Internet: a library of Patriot (American militia groups)
material and guides on how to make bombs, plastic explosives, and the
gas recently used by terrorists to kill Japanese subway riders.<p>

Sol Littman of Toronto said the Internet gives hate mongers the ability
to reach millions in seconds.<p>

"It will make a radical change in their ability to reach out and
organize."<p>

But others worry censoring computer networks could endanger
democracy.<p>

"The Broadcasting Act is not a good route to take,'' says Marita Moll,
co-organizer Public information advisory council.<p>

"We would be much better served if the online medium was viewed in the
same way we view the telephone medium - as a communications medium in
which the person who is using it is liable for the kind of content they
put on there."<p>

Under the Broadcasting Act, companies providing information services on
the computer network would become gatekeepers, she said. That would be
like making Bell responsible for what people say on the phone.<p>

"It seems like an extremely dangerous way of looking at a communications
medium in the democratic world. It would give major service providers
control over content."<p>

Justice Minister Allan Rock said Wednesday he is waiting for a report
from a national advisory council set up to make recommendations on the
Internet.<p>

"We have to decide whether there are practical ways of limiting what's
put on the Internet, how that should be approached legally and how
that's enforced."<p>

<b><i>Daily News Worldwide</i> columnist Peter March speaks out about the Canadian
government's gun grab.</b><p>
<hr>

<i>THE DAILY NEWS WORLDWIDE</i><br>
(posted on the World Wide Web)<br>
Tuesday, May 23, 1995<p>

<i>by Peter March</b>
<p>

Remember that, as far as guns go, the government, not criminals is the
potential enemy. Hence, we should not let the government know who has guns,
who has the ammunition. The government should not be allowed to know what
kind of guns are out there - nor how, nor when, nor where they might be
brought together to form a citizen army. Political freedom is only secured
by genuine power, and such power is ultimately secured only by force.<p>

For where a citizenry loses the ability to counter government force with
an adequate force of it's own, it loses the ultimate guarantee of it's
freedoms and rights. Human freedom is always and only, threatened by other
humans who are prepared to use force. Against this threat, a wise citizenry
will retain sufficient power to fight back, to fight any government that
threatens it's freedoms.<p>

The prime minister asks why we allow the registration of pets but are
unwilling to register our guns. The answer is that we do not rely on cats
and dogs for our freedom. Guns, however, are the essential tool of power,
they are the fundamental tool of self-defence. The government knows that
and keeps a good supply for itself. And don't say such guns are only for
"outside" forces. Think of your local police force, and by golly, remember
Oka, by God remember the FLQ "crisis" when an unrepentant "Liberal" was
quite ready to declare the War Measures Act in peace time.<p>

No doubt Canadians will accept gun control. They will not notice that this
will mean the government can quickly and effectively collect all the guns
in the country. They will not see that by this measure they lose the
fundamental guarantee of citizen freedom against the abuses of power by
government. They will accept the argument that there is no use for a gun
other than hunting, collecting and target practice. Like innocents who want
to believe in the goodness of their elected representatives, they will deny
themselves the protection they need from these very representatives.<p>

Guns are needed in citizens' hands not for hunting or protection from
criminals. Such uses are scarcely worth the cost of the weapon. Guns are
needed against that evil day when the government becomes the enemy of the
citizens. Won't happen here? won't happen in the U.S.A.? Why not? Why are
we immune from the abuse of power by government? We must be different!
What is it? Genes that make us better? Our special history? Do we have
a new and wonderful culture safe from the political disasters that have
afflicted all other cultures in the past?<p>

What many in the United States understand in their bones is that the right
to have a gun, a well functioning gun, is a crucial right. Because the
American "balance of power" that political scientists talk such rubbish
about is not between the legislatures, the judiciary, and the executive
branch: the vital balance is between established authority, wherever it
resides, and the power of the citizenry. In America, the great balance
must therefore be between the citizenry on one hand and that mass of
powers that combine to restrict citizen freedoms. The presidency, the
judiciary, the legislatures, and powerful civil servants.<p>

The balance that matters is not between those in power but between those
in power and those who have relinquished their power, temporarily, on the
understanding that their freedom is respected. And the citizenry must
retain the ability to regain that relinquished power, by force, if
necessary.<p>

The same is true in Canada. Yet we have no understanding of the issues.
The National Rifle Association is not a bunch of cranks, it is a bunch
of people who in one way or another understand enough about history,
enough about human nature, to know that, ultimately, we must be prepared
to defend citizen freedom with a gun.<p>

We act as if we are naive about humans and about the troubles they get
themselves into, and about their willingness to violate one another's'
rights. We act as if we are naive about ourselves.<p>

there is no question that most governments will feel mystified and even
hurt when citizens insist on the right to keep guns. Those who are in
government are bound to feel offended when we do not give governments
that ultimate trust involved in disarming ourselves completely. But we
should be firm. History speaks clearly of the need of all citizens to be
prepared to defend themselves against the abuse of power by governments.<p>

Not today, of course, and not tomorrow will you need a gun. Perhaps not
in your lifetime. The need will arise only when Canada evolves into a
country where a government abuses its power. Against that sad day, and
despite the human cost, we should hang on to the right to own an un-
registered gun.<p>

<i>American Dissident Voices to be aired 29th April, 1995 by Dr. William L. Pierce, chairman, National Alliance:</i>

<hr>

<p>Hello, my fellow Americans and all my friends around the world.

<p>When the Federal Building in Oklahoma City was blown up a few days ago,
I was shocked. I didn't know who had done the bombing, of course, but I
had a very strong feeling that it was no coincidence that it came on
the second anniversary of the Clinton massacre at Waco. I felt an
intuition close to certainty that the bombing had not been an attack by
foreigners aimed at America but instead was an attack by Americans
aimed specifically at Clinton and his kind.

<p>I listened to the expressions of pious outrage by Bill Clinton and Janet
Reno and the other government gangsters on television that evening, and
I thought, "You hypocrites! What do you expect? You are the real
terrorists. When a government engages in terrorism against its own
citizens, it should not be surprised when some of those citizens strike
back and engage in terrorism against the government. You are the ones
responsible for this bombing, for the deaths of these children."

<p>Terrorism is a nasty business. Most of its victims are innocent people.
Some of the office workers who died in the Federal Building in Oklahoma
City may have been as much against the Clinton government as were those
who set off the bomb. But terrorism is a form of warfare, and in war
most of the victims are noncombatants. Certainly, none of us can
condone the killing of children, but in fact it is the Clinton
government which has led the way in the killing of children. About as
many  children died in the Waco massacre alone as in the Oklahoma City
bombing. It really infuriates me to see creatures like Bill Clinton and
Janet Reno shedding crocodile tears over slaughtered children. These
two are using the bodies of the dead children as a shield for
themselves. How many tears did they shed over the children they burned
to death in Waco? The hatred one hears in their voices when they talk
about the Oklahoma City bombers is not because children were killed; it
is because they know that the bombing was aimed at them, at Bill Clinton
and company.

<p>Americans haven't had a real war fought on their own soil for 130 years.
We haven't experienced any significant domestic terrorism since Bill
Clinton and his pro-Viet Cong buddies were burning ROTC buildings and
bombing draft offices back during the Vietnam war, and that was
relatively tame stuff. I think things are about to change.

<p>The U.S. government has been trashing other people's countries for a
long time now and getting away with it. The U.S. government has been
sponsoring Israeli terrorism in the Middle East for nearly 50 years,
financing and condoning the assassinations and bombings of Arabs by
Jews year after year, with remarkable forbearance on the part of the
Arabs. The bombing of the World Trade Center in New York by Muslims was
a very small reprisal for all of that.

<p>After the U.S. government smashed Iraq four years ago in order to make
the Middle East safe for Greater Israel, slaughtering thousands of
Iraqi children in the process, there was much government talk about the
danger of Iraqi terrorism, but nothing ever came of it. But now
something new is about to happen, I believe. A growing number of
Americans have such a hatred of the government in Washington that some
of them will commit desperate and foolish acts like the Oklahoma City
bombing. A growing number will turn to terrorism as their only weapon
against a terrorist government. And I suspect that we'll see some real
terrorism--planned, organized terrorism--before too long. I suspect that
a growing number of exasperated, fed-up Americans will begin engaging
in terrorism on a scale that the world has never seen before.

<p>As I said a moment ago, my first suspicion was that the Oklahoma City
bombing might have been done by persons sympathetic to the victims of
the government's Waco massacre. Things have reached the point in
America, however, that this bombing could have been done by any of a
very large number of angry, desperate people. The FBI has a list of
potential terrorists that it checks whenever something like this
happens, but in recent years that list has grown so large that it's
become practically useless. This may come as a surprise to some
citizens, but, believe me, there are many, many Americans who have come
to consider the U.S. government their worst enemy. And among those
Americans there are some who feel a sense of responsibility to do
something about that enemy.

<p>Let's get specific. If you watch a lot of television, you're easily
misled into believing that the attitudes and sentiments you see on your
screen are those of all Americans. They aren't. They are the attitudes
and sentiments of those segments of the population which believe that
things have never been better in America and that we have a wonderful
government. Foremost among these are the media people themselves--not
just the Jewish media bosses, but all of those who have their snouts in
the media trough, including the commentators. And, of course, there are
the politicians and the bureaucrats. And the homosexuals and the career
women. And the minorities. The Clinton constituency. They just love all
of the artificial equality and all of the special privileges which have
been bestowed on them. They can't imagine why anyone would want to go
back to the bad, old days when this was a White country, and men were
men, and women were women, and the freaks stayed in the closet, and
everyone worked for his living.

<p>Watching television you'd never know it, but there are some normal
people with healthy instincts left in America. And not just
heterosexual White males. There are still White women left in this
country who believe that being a mother and a homemaker is not a fate
worse than death: women who don't want want more laws requiring that
they be hired as prison guards or furniture movers or making it a " hate
crime" to hold a door open for them, but who do want a clean, healthy,
White world for their children to grow up in.

<p>Certainly, not all of these normal, healthy White men and women are
potential terrorists. But a very substantial portion of them are
intensely hostile to the government. That portion can only grow during
the next few years. It's not just the Waco massacre or the bombing of
Baghdad or this country's criminal policy in the Middle East which
makes so many Americans hate their government. It's what the government
has done to America.

<p>It's the government's deliberate flooding of our country with non-Whites
from the Third World, and the refusal to halt the massive illegal
immigration across our border with Mexico and the Caribbean. It's the
government's catering to the worst elements in the population, buying
their votes with welfare programs paid for by our hard work. It's the
government's theft of our freedom--with ever more oppressive taxes, with
ever more restrictive rules and regulations of one sort or another, with
efforts to take away our right to protect ourselves and our families.

<p>It's the more and more obviously corrupt and degenerate politicians who
are holding the highest offices in the government: crooks and liars of
the sort typified by Bill Clinton.

<p>It's the government's treasonous abdication of the responsibility
entrusted to it, its shortsighted quest for votes, its willingness
always to be led by the Jewish media rather than by a concern for the
good of the country.

<p>It's the government's deliberate turning away from the people who built
America and its cynical promotion of "multiculturalism," with the
consequent ruin of our schools, the degradation of our popular culture,
and the conversion of our cities into crime-infested hell holes. The
government and the controlled media are responsible for the spiritual

poisoning of our young people: young Whites singing rap ditties and
behaving like Blacks.

<p>To yuppies in New York and Washington, none of these things may seem
very important. For people who have never had an unfashionable thought
in their heads, for people who turn to their television for all of their
opinions and attitudes, it may be hard to understand why anyone would be
upset about what the government has done to America. But, believe me,
there are plenty of people who are very upset.

<p>People used to complain about the government's destructive policies, and
they used to write their Congressmen and hope that what was happening
was only a temporary aberration. But after decades of writing their
Congressmen and watching things become worse and worse, they're just
plain mad as hell. The privileged classes I named a minute ago--the
Jews and the politicians and the homosexuals and the minorities and the
female executives--who believe that this is the best of all possible
worlds, have no idea how angry, how furious, normal Americans are. And,
as I said, they're only going to get madder as time goes on. The ones
who aren't mad are the ones who've simply become alienated. They have
given up all hope for restoring any sort of sanity or decency to the
country and are just looking out for themselves.

<p>When people are pushed as far as they are willing to go, and when they
believe that they have nothing left to lose, then they will resort to
terrorism. There will be more and more such people in the future. Even
if they have no well thought-out plan, even if they belong to no
organization and have no real ideology, even if they only are striking
out as angry, frustrated individuals, their numbers and their deeds will
grow. Such disorganized terrorism, motivated by anger rather than by a
plan, will never bring down the government. About all it can accomplish
is the weakening of the self-confidence of the government's supporters
and the encouragement of the government's enemies. A long enough and
intense enough period of terrorism can discourage many people from
making long-term career plans and can lead to more of a short-term
mind-set in the general population, a let's-get-through-life-one-day-at-
a-time outlook. But by itself it can't really accomplish anything
positive.

<p>It's really too bad that innocent people will die--especially innocent
children. It's too bad that people will be maimed and injured. It's too
bad that people will be made fearful. If people could act in a
rational way, all of that could be avoided. But they never do. When a
civilization is dying, when the soul of a people is being poisoned,
all sorts of irrational behavior takes place. The government does
bizarre and destructive things. Individual citizens do bizarre and
destructive things. And bloodshed and suffering are inevitable. It will
become worse. There is nothing the government can do to stop
it--certainly not a government headed by the likes of Bill Clinton.

<p>So what ought people like us to do: people who approve of neither
government terrorism, such as the Waco massacre or the bombing of
Baghdad, nor private terrorism, such as the Oklahoma City bombing?
Should we just sit on our hands and watch the government terrorists and
the private terrorists fight it out?

<p>That, unfortunately, is what most of us have been doing until now. We've
watched it all on television, but we haven't done anything about it. I
believe that it's time for a few of us to begin shouldering a little
responsibility for what's going on in the world around us. After all,
it's our civilization they're destroying.

<p>Here's what I believe that we can and should do. We should help the more
perceptive members of the public to see terrorism in its context,
rather than merely as a series of individual acts. Back during the
Vietnam war, when Bill Clinton's buddies were bombing ROTC buildings
and draft board offices, and when they used a fertilizer bomb of the
same sort used in Oklahoma City to blow up a research center at the
University of Wisconsin, the context was clear. The terrorism was a
protest against U.S. involvement in the war. The whole public understood
that.

<p>We need to help people understand that a good bit, if not all, of the
private terrorism we'll be seeing in the future will be a protest
against the government's destruction of America. And most of the
government terrorism will be an effort to frighten the government's
critics into silence and inactivity. More and more, the government will
lash out at dissidents, at anyone who is not Politically Correct. And
the two sides will feed on each other: the more repressive and
terroristic the government becomes, the more individuals there'll be
who'll engage in terrorism to get back at the government. And the more
individual terrorism there is against the government, the more
terroristic the government will become in turn. And the rest of us will
be caught between them.

<p>More important than helping people understand the cause of private
terrorism is helping them to understand the role of the government in
terrorism. The problem is that when the government commits a terrorist
act, it's not called terrorism. It's always called something else. That
confuses people. I'll bet that before the Oklahoma City bombing ninety
per cent of the general public couldn't have told you what happened in
Waco, Texas, two years ago. And most of those who did remember the Waco
massacre remembered it the way the controlled media described it: as a
justified police raid on a group of dangerous extremists.

<p>"Extremists": that's one of those buzz words the controlled media and
the government use when they want to prejudice the public against
someone. The public needs to be told that the people killed at Waco
were just members of a fundamentalist Christian church that didn't like
the government, but they were no threat to anybody. The government had
no business interfering in their lives. The people who ordered the raid
on the Branch Davidian church which killed nearly a hundred innocent
people, mostly women and children, were Bill Clinton and Janet Reno.
They did it simply because the Davidians were different. Their religion was
odd. They weren't part of the mainstream. They weren't fashionable. And
Bill Clinton and Janet Reno are still sitting in their offices in
Washington, condemning other terrorists, telling everyone that they
won't tolerate terrorism. And as long as people like them are allowed
to hold pubic office and to get away with mass murder, we'll have a
growing problem of terrorism to worry about. People need to understand
that.

<p>We'll never have peace in America until the general public understands
the government's role in provoking and committing terrorism and is
ready to call the government to account for it. I don't know who set
off the bomb in Oklahoma city or exactly what their motive was, but I
have a suspicion that if Bill Clinton and Janet Reno had been put on
trial for murdering all those children in Waco two years ago, there
wouldn't have been an Oklahoma City bombing a week ago.

<p>Violence breeds violence. I wish there were a way we could stop it, but
I think that about all we can do now is understand it and try to help
other people understand it too. The bond of trust between the U.S.
government and its citizens has been broken, and it's far too late to
mend it. The rift between normal, healthy Americans and the Clinton
constituency will continue to grow. Let's try to keep as many of those
normal Americans as we can looking at the big picture and not letting
themselves be confused by the controlled media.

<p>The Clinton constituency, the privileged classes who support government terrorism against the rest of us, will be pushing hard for more
government repression. They'll be pushing for scrapping what's left of
the First Amendment and passing laws against any form of Politically
Incorrect expression. They believe that if they can control what normal Americans read and hear and think, they can control what we do. Even before the Oklahoma City bombing, Jewish groups such as the Simon
Wiesenthal Center and the Southern Poverty Law Center and the B'nai
B'rith were lobbying for laws to keep Politically Incorrect ideas off
the "information superhighway," off the Internet. Now they'll use each
new incident of terrorism as an excuse for censorship, for repression,
for controlling what people are permitted to say and hear and read and
write. They'll say, "If there had been more laws against 'extremists,'
against people who don't like the government, against people who don't
think the way we tell them to think, this wouldn't have happened."
They'll try to stampede a timid, frightened, confused public into
allowing the government to take away even more of their rights in
return for the false promise of more security.

<p>Our task is to halt that stampede by helping people understand who
America's real enemies are, by helping them understand the underlying
causes of terrorism, and by encouraging them to stand together in a
united front against government terrorism. We must begin laying the
groundwork for an America in which there is no terrorism. Thanks for
being with me today.

<h3>Oklahoma City--</h3>

<h1>J'Accuse!</h1>

<h4>by Eustace Mullins</h4>

<p>J'Accuse!  This is the title of the French Novelist Emile Zola's
trenchant work of the nineteenth century, which accused the Government
of France of brazen corruption. Today, in the United States, I accuse
the federal government of planning and perpetrating the most horrible
crimes, a series which culminated in the April 19, 1995 bombing of the
federal building in Oklahoma City.  This was a deliberate conspiracy by
corrupt and treasonous elements in the federal agencies in Washington as
part of a plan to provoke martial law, confiscate legal guns from
American citizens, and to wipe out the citizens militia of the several
states.

<p>For the past fifty years, I have repeatedly warned conservative
groups throughout this nation that when any person comes into your
meetings, demands that you take more stringent action against the
enemies of America, and urges you to bomb a building or to assassinate
an official, that person has revealed himself as an agent of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation or of its parent group, the Anti-Defamation
League of B'Nai B'Rith.

<p>Most patriotic groups chafe under the belief that they are not
accomplishing enough, that they are not moving fast enough.  Their
younger members are easy prey for anyone who comes in and says, "You
guys are a bunch of pansies.  Why don't you let the enemy know that you
mean business?  Direct action now - that's the way to make them fear
you."  The bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City can be seen
to be part of an ongoing pattern of activity. But is it more logical to
draw a direct line from a small group of inexperienced militiamen in
Michigan to a couple of young and rootless army veterans to the federal
building in Oklahoma City - or does it make more sense to draw a direct
line from the massacre of the Weaver family at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, to the
Waco Church Holocaust in Texas, to the New York Trade Center building
which was bombed in New York City, to the federal office building in
Oklahoma City, a line beginning with the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai
B"Rith, leading directly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and its
many agents and informants throughout these United States?

<p>After this latest outrage, there was an immediate reaction,
unrehearsed and unaffected by anyone else's opinions, among
conservatives throughout the United States that the Oklahoma City
bombing could not be anything but a federal operation. These opinions
have flooded the nation's airwaves and the front pages of major
newspapers. When I was asked about it, I replied without even thinking,
"It's a standard FBI operation."  After all, I have been chronicling
these FBI atrocities, whose victims have included myself and many
members of my family, for more than fifty years.  My compatriot M.J.
"Red" Beckman, with whom I addressed members of the MOM, Militia of
Montana, in Idaho only a few days before this latest outrage, was quoted
on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, April 24, 1995, "It has
all the earmarks of a CIA, FBI, or BATF operation," when he was asked
about the Oklahoma City bombing. On the widely viewed <i>60 Minutes</i>
program of April 23, 1995, reporter Leslie Stahl was horrified during
her interview with Gen. Norman Olson, commander of the Michigan militia,
when he observed, "I feel sure that you will find that this bombing is a
federal government operation."  How can you say such a thing?" shrieked
Stahl, reeling back as though she had been struck a mortal blow. "How
could you think that our federal government would do such a thing?"  Not
all of us live in the cozy liberal cocoon in which Leslie Stahl has
wrapped herself.  We deal with the real world, a world in which
politicians of the stripe of President Clinton know that if you want to
carry out a program, you have to infiltrate and control the opposition,
you have to shed some blood, and you have to weep for the innocent
babies whom you have ordered to be murdered. Will Bill Clinton be
remembered as the King Herod of our day?

<p>All over the United States, conservatives on talk shows, either the
hosts or the callers, or both, are echoing General Olson's belief that
the Oklahoma City bombing could only have been part of a federal
program.  There is an ancient question - Cui bono?  Who stands to gain
the most from this bombing?  Bill Clinton answered that question a few
hours after the bombing, when he announced to the press that for the
first time, he now believed that he had a chance to be reelected in
1996!  He then urged Congress to pass the Omnibus Anti-Terrorism Bill,
Bill No. 896, which had been hopelessly stalled in Congress, with no
chance of getting enough votes for passage.  It had been written by the
Anti-Defamation League, and introduced to Congress by the Congressional
spokesman for the ADL, Con. Charles Schumer.

<p>During the past several months, leaders of militia groups throughout
the United States had been warned that something big was coming down,
that the federal government was planning an incident which would provoke
martial law throughout the United States, resulting in confiscation of
all privately owned guns, and the forcible dissolution of all citizens'
militia units.  The April 19, 1995 bombing of the federal building in
Oklahoma City proved to be the planned provocation.  The idea that any
person associated with any militia unit would carry out such a bombing,
whose only possible results would be the federal outlawing of all
militia units, was unbelievable.

<p>After the bombing, media coverage featured maps drawn of all militia
units in the United States. These maps were prominently labeled,
"Prepared by the Anti-Defamation League appeared on national television,
boasting that they had been tracking and monitoring the militia for many
months.  Peter Jennings, Dan Rather, and other commentators repeatedly
noted that "The Anti- Defamation League has done a great job of tracking
these militia units."  If the Anti-Defamation League had been tracking
the militia operations in painstaking detail throughout the United
States, as they boasted, why would they have stood by and let them blow
up the federal office building in Oklahoma City?

<p>This bombing revealed the Anti-Defamation League's hand, its
longstanding determination to wipe out all citizens militia units
throughout the United States.  Why does the ADL insist on this goal?
Because the militia is now the only organized threat to the Zionists'
absolute control of the United States.  The ADL is in total control of
the FBI, the Department of Justice, all federal agencies, the military
forces, and the three branches of the national government.  The only
remaining area of resistance to their total control of our nation is the
state militia, which are now practicing maneuvers in twenty-six states.

<p>The news of the Oklahoma City bombing removed the testimony of
Hillary and Bill Clinton before Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr, in the
Whitewater Hearings, from the front page to the back pages of some
newspapers.  It never made the press in most cities.  The news that
thousands more innocents had been massacred in Rwanda also failed to
make most of the newspapers. Reams of coverage was devoted to the
innocent babies killed in Oklahoma City by the same newspapers which had
ignored the burning alive of many babies at their church in Waco.
Attorney General Reno had condemned them by claiming that they had been
the victims of  "child abuse."   After they were dead and their little
bodies bulldozed into the ground by the government agents, Reno admitted
that it all had been a lie, and that there had never been any child
abuse in Waco.  Government agents admitted that one of the suspects in
the Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh, had been bitter about the
Waco Holocaust.  They have offered no clues as to how a young,
penniless, unemployed Army veteran could have amassed the resources
necessary to carry out this massive bombing operation. Bets are now
being taken as to whether McVeigh will go the way of Lee Harvey Oswald,
before he appears for trial.  Perhaps he will be "overcome by remorse"
and will be a "suicide" in his cell.

<p>In addition to urging Congress to pass the ADL's Omnibus
Anti-Terrorism Bill at once, President Clinton also has submitted
demands to Congress for a special counter-terrorist organizations,
meaning presumably, any group which dares to disagree with the
Democratic Party's agenda; and to give the FBI unlimited authority to
bug telephones, seize mail, seize credit card records, and to employ
many other types of electronic surveillance.

<p>Meanwhile, the FBI is maintaining its Keystone Cops image by its
frantic efforts to solve this "crime," including the initial release
that two suspects seen fleeing the scene just before the Oklahoma City
bombing were obviously of "Arabic descent."  An Arab-American was
arrested because some ordinary electric cord was found in his luggage in
London; he was promptly released, as was an AWOL soldier in California
who had been the object of a nationwide alert as "John Doe No.2"  He was
also released and returned to his Army unit.  The haste to bring in
these "culprits" may well have been due to FBI concerns that the public
might well believe that the only possible perpetrator of this bombing
would be the FBI itself, or its multitudinous agents.

<p>To understand why the FBI would be involved in planning such a
terrible atrocity, we have only to look at the known involvement of the
FBI in many previous bombings and atrocities.  There was the murder
raid in Idaho, in which the FBI agents were instructed that no member
of the Weaver family was to be allowed to remain alive; the Waco Church
Holocaust, in which many worshipers, including innocent children, were
burned alive while worshiping in their church, an atrocity which
surpasses the worst accusations made against the Nazis in Germany; the
New York World Trade Center bombing, in which a rented truck filled
with explosives was parked at the building, the identical plan in which
a rented truck was parked at the Oklahoma City federal office building.

<p>The rented vehicle in both cases is a very important factor in
identifying FBI participation; professional terrorists would have
stolen a vehicle which could not be traced to them.  FBI rules demand
the use of a rented vehicle, so that it can be traced for the all
important Moscow show trial which is to crucial to their techniques.
The <i>New York Times</i> has been printing reams of copy about the
New York World Trade Center bombing, in which it repeatedly identifies
the key figure in the operation from the very beginning as a paid FBI
informant, Emad Salem, a former Egyptian Army officer who was recruited
by the FBI for this bombing.  Do we really need any more proof that
this was a typical ADL-FBI operation? In Los Angeles some months ago,
several youths were arrested and charged with plans to bomb buildings.
They indignantly protested that the only mention of any bombing has
come from a paid FBI informant who had infiltrated their meetings, and
who had then turned them in to the FBI in order to collect his pay.

<p>Strangely enough, no new information about the Oklahoma City bombings
seems to be released to the press.  The <i>Washington Post</i>. April 26, 1995
reported that "None of the fifteen ATF employees died in the blast."
There are persistent reports that FBI and ATF agents did not show up at
the building the morning of the blast.  Perhaps other odd circumstances
will emerge later, although it is more probable that we already know as
much about this atrocity as we will ever know. To remedy this situation,
we need a nationwide drive to demand a full and immediate Congressional
investigation of FBI and ADL involvement in the Oklahoma City federal
office building bombing, as well as information about any other federal
agencies who took part in planning this operation, or who had advance
knowledge that it would take place.

<p>This writer has insisted from the past thirty years that our own
native Gestapo, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which operates
solely as a secret police to carry out the desires of its masters, the
Anti-Defamation League, be abolished.  It is now widely known that the
ADL gained total control of the FBI by photographing its legendary
director, J. Edgar Hoover, in flagrant delicto with his longtime
consort, Clyde Tolson, as their suite at Miami's Roney Plaza Hotel.  The
Roney Plaza, a Meyer Schine hotel, not only was the official winter
headquarters of the Mafia; it was also the annual retreat of J. Edgar
Hoover, who was an honored guest there each winter season, with Clyde
Tolson always in attendance.  With these photographs, the ADL, and its
longstanding ally, the Mafia, attained absolute mastery of J. Edgar
Hoover, and the FBI because their willing servant.

<p>This Congressional investigation must obtain all memoranda between the
FBI and the ADL; all possible contacts in planning these many bombing
operations must be interviewed and full statements obtained from each of
them.  All federal officials and ADL planners of these criminal
syndicalist operations must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the
law.  We can no longer allow these menaces to public Safety to run
amuck.

<p>At approximately 5:30 a.m. on Sunday, May 7, the Toronto home and headquarters of Ernst Z&uuml;ndel, the German-Canadian revisionist publisher, was attacked by arsonist(s).
 
<p>The large Victorian home suffered extensive damage to the upper story. It was occupied at the time of the attack, though not by Mr. Z&uuml;ndel who was in western Canada.
 
<p>A surveillance camera captured the perpetator(s) dousing the front of the building with an inflammatory substance, presumably gasoline. A videotape of the attack has been turned over to Toronto police.
 
<p>The building was insured but not the contents. Some of Mr. Z&uuml;ndel's priceless files pertaining to his two historic trials for publishing the book <b><i>Did Six
Million Really Die?</i></b> were lost in the fire.

<img align=right src="images/Zundel.jpg" alt="Ernst Z&uuml;ndel" hspace=15 vspace=5> 

<p>Arson of an occupied building constitutes attempted murder.
 
<p>The Z&uuml;ndel house, located in a bohemian neighborhood, has for years been the
target of leftist groups. Recently their threats escalated.
 
<p>For further information telephone 416-922-9850.

<h1>FROM THE FRONT DESK...</h1>

<p>In his recently-aired documentary, <i>Hearts of Hate</i>, film producer Peter Raymont stated, "There's a war being waged in Canada, a battle for young minds... Hard times, harder hearts have profoundly changed Canada. Many young people have lost hope 
of ever finding a job, or living as well as their parents."

<p>Sounded promising!

<p>Would he turn his lens on the treacherous and treasonous power-brokers on Parliament Hill? After all, he did promise to shine a
bright light into the dark corners of our society. Surely, there are no darker corners than the cavernous halls of power in Ottawa, where sinister decisions are made on a daily basis - decisions that affect the life of every Canadian on a daily basis, wh
ile they have little or no say in how their affairs are run. Decisions that will mean the ultimate destruction of the nation that our forefathers struggled to build.

<p>Of course, I'm being facetious. We knew damn well what this film was about. The evils of racism!

<p>If Raymont's intent was to make that Heritage Front look bad, he failed miserably. Cloistered away in his elitist cocoon, he failed to recognize the real anger and discontent that's out there.  Thousands of viewers who had suspected that we weren't qu
ite as evil as the likes of Bernie Farber have tried to portray us, suddenly got a chance to judge us without the usual System filters perverting the message. And they liked what they heard. The response has been overwhelming.

<p>Could we ask any more?

writers will be identified solely by the first three characters of
their postal or zip codes.</i>

<hr>
<p>Dear <strong>Up Front</strong>:
<p>While I thoroughly enjoyed your lengthy article on the traitorous
spy Grant Bristow, I have a problem with the way you chose to
criticize and mock <i>Toronto Sun</i> reporter, Bill Dunphy.
<p>Your article claims that many people were suspicious of the mole
from the beginning:
<p>- 1. an NPC drunk stated, "looks like a cop to me"
<p>- 2. Droege and Lincoln chose to brush off these accusations, even
though they too, had strong suspicions.
<p>- 3. Gary Schipper crowed, "we knew he was a rat."
<p>Yet, none of you did anything to correct the problem. It took Bill
Dunphy to expose the rat Bristow. And even after the rest of the
media ran with the story, it was Dunphy who analyzed the situation
and put things in their proper perspective.
<p>In my humble opinion, Mr. Dunphy is a brilliant investigative
journalist with an uncanny talent for observation. It seems we all
owe him a debt of gratitude.
<p>I wish to remain anonymous at this time.
<p>M5A
<p><i>Is that you Bill?</i>
<hr>
<p>Dear Heritage Front:
<p>After reading "Adios El Observador" on the Internet, I was
intrigued. I wish to order a copy of the "Bristow" issue of your
magazine. Enclosed please find $30.00.

<p><i>For $30.00 we'll throw in the video too.</i>
<hr>
<p>Dear <strong>Up Front</strong> readers:
<p>Although our ruling elite are doing their best to prevent us from
looking at crime statistics based on race, it is common knowledge
who is committing the majority of crimes in our multiracial
paradise.
<p>Even though they are still a minority, even in Toronto, more than
three-quarters of all violent and drug-related crimes are
perpetrated by one group. A holdup squad officer, who did not want
to be named mentioned a figure of 85%.
<p>Even with our toothless justice system which regularly releases
them back into the community revolving door-style, this group now
comprises a large segment of our prison population.
<p>Our rulers, the liberal media and other ethnic screamers have
deigned to spare us these stats, but if the race of an assailant is
not reported, you can safely assume that he is not White.
<p>The absurdity of crime reporting becomes ridiculous when one hears
a criminal's description broadcast on the radio: The suspect is
five-feet-ten, a hundred and sixty pounds, with short hair, wearing
a blue jacket and a red baseball cap.
<p>TV journalists use their own bag of tricks. Recently they showed
footage of a suspect, arrested for a convenience store holdup. The
camera operator was careful to shoot well below the knees of the
suspect - not even the palms of his hands were showing. But his
day-glo green track pants told me all I needed to know.
<p>Is our media really all that different from the old PRAVDA of the
Soviet Union?
<p>M6G
<p><i>We learn to read between the lines.</i>
<hr>
<p>Dear Heritage Front:
<p>With a fine organization like the HF why do some of these little
Mickey Mouse organizations insist on trying to compete with you
rather than working alongside to further our cause?

<p><i>According to Milton, 'tis better to rule in hell than serve in

<hr>
<p>Dear Canadian Nationalists:
<p>Very little is known about Canada in Sweden (except when it
concerns hockey) and even less about your racial situation. After
having read the South African magazine <i>Impact</i> I have come to
realize that Canada has just as great - perhaps even greater -
problems with multiracialism and liberalism as Sweden, Europe and
the rest of the White world.
<p>Canada and Sweden are in many ways similar. Both sparsely
populated, with non-germanic minorities, and breathtaking scenery
throughout our land. We are both bilingual, Canada, English and
French, Sweden, Swedish and Finnish. I don't know about
Canada, but in Sweden the fastest growing religion today is -
Islam!
<p>I simply cannot believe that so many people have bought the
liberal-communist lies about the equality of all races.
<p>I have often wondered why - in the liberal mind - only the Left
can be oppressed; never the Right or Nationalists. In Germany you
can get five years in prison for denying the Holocaust. How many
years do you get for denying Stalin's murders? Have you ever heard
Amnesty International protest?
<p>I take great interest in the racial situation all over the White
world. I would therefore like to obtain a copy of your publication,
<strong>Up Front</strong>, and for that I enclose SEK 40 (CDN $7.40).

<hr>
<p>Dear <strong>Up Front</strong>:
<p>Thank you for the November issue of <strong>Up Front</strong>. My son (23) raved
about it. Your magazine has good substance (subjects, facts and
presentation) that will appeal even to middle-aged and "timid"
Canadians. I sincerely hope that you will always strive to maintain
and even improve upon your public image.

<p><i>You can help - share this magazine with your like-minded friends.</i>
<hr>
<p>Dear Heritage Front:
<p>It amazes me how much abuse at the hands of the leftists we take.
<p>The majority of our people sit on their butts, drink beer and watch
hockey while their brains run in reverse.
<p>In the <i>Etobicoke Guardian</i>, a community newspaper, dated January
11, 1995, the headline ran "SOMALI GROUP RECEIVES GRANT." In 1993
several groups within the Somali community formed a coalition to
aid new immigrants from the death-ravaged cesspool that they call
their homeland.
<p>As the story goes, this coalition received $75,000 from the
Ontario Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration Canada, the
Department of Canadian Heritage and the municipality of Metro
Toronto, with in-kind assistance from the United Way.
<p>This grant will help the tribesmen adjust to their new life as
"Canadians" (yeah, right!). The Family Services Association of
Metro Toronto will assist the "coalition" with the project startup
and operational phase, then turn all operations over to the
coalition.
<p>The project will be titled "DIJINTA BEESHA." (What a handle!)
<p>This is a blatant example of government waste. They don't dare to
go to the people to ask if this is an acceptable use of their tax
dollars, because they know bloody well that if asked, the majority
would respond with a resounding "NO!"
<p>Instead, they quietly implement any left-wing commie plan that
they see fit to, and we foot the bill.
<p>M9V
<p><i>Our government grant - Grant Bristow - produced more positive
results than can ever be expected from "Dejinta Deesha."</i>
<hr>
<p>Dear <strong>Up Front</strong>:
<p>The recent Republican win in the U.S. shows that Americans are fed
up with liberal nonsense. The `Silent Majority' has spoken, but
will the G.O.P. hear them, or will they cave to special interest
pressure?
<p>701
<p><i>Media control is a must if we are to prevail. The Internet is a
first step.</i>
<hr>
<p>Dear <strong>Up Front</strong>:
<p>The PC line is that "immigrants enrich Canada." Right now, how
many Third Worlders have just thought to themselves: "I must go to
Canada and enrich those poor souls." Better for us they should take
their benevolence and "enrich" their brothers in Uganda or Somalia.
<p>V9S
<p><i>And put all those creepy immigration lawyers out of work?</i>
<hr>
<p>Dear Heritage Front:
<p>While perusing a bulletin board at the Mississauga Central
Library, I spotted an advertisement for free ESL (English Second
Language) courses sponsored by some organization.
<p>Now we all know that nothing is really free. Who pays? You and I!
<p>Who can't speak English? Surely not you or me - we were born here!
<p>Who benefits? Three guesses! Who paid all the taxes to build the
schools and the teachers' salaries? You and I did!
<p>And who will leave when the economy collapses and there are no
jobs and the welfare runs dry? I don't have to spell it out, do I?
<p>And who will be left to clean up the mess? You and I, of course.
<p>Who should stop this mess before it really hits the fan? You and
I!

<p>Dear <strong>Up Front</strong>:
<p>I've never bothered to formulate an opinion on abortion, one way
or the other, so this is just an observation.
<p>I find it ironic that on the one hand the government takes a "pro-
choice" stance and legalizes and sanctions the killing of an unborn
fetus, yet on the other, they ignore the convictions of a religious
sect, forcing parents to submit their children to blood
transfusions against their will. Is this not a double standard?
<p>L9A
<p><i>Politicians are consistent only in the application of double
standards.</i>
<hr>
<p>Dear <strong>Up Front</strong>:
<p>I was impressed by Wolfgang Droege's remarkable showing at the
polls during the recent municipal elections.
<p>Fourteen percent of the vote is quite an achievement, when one considers the
handicap he endured. And I believe that 14% is the largest vote
garnered by any openly racialist candidate to run in Canada since
the Second World War. In a system of proportional representation,
this could have translated to a seat on city council.
<p>Despite a court-imposed gag order which forbade him from talking
to the media, he made sure that everyone in his ward received his
election pamphlet. So, I believe that he received a vote which is
fairly reflective of the population at large. I'm sure no one was
misled or ignorant as to who they were voting for. Although they're
slow to admit it, many people are starting to realize that race is
one of the most important issues facing us today. Ironically,
negative media coverage made sure of that.
<p>It's comforting to know that at least 14% of the population is
with us, sharing our views and ideas.
<p>I would also like to congratulate all the other Heritage Front
candidates for their courage in standing up for their (and our)
beliefs, and putting their names on the ballot. Their bravery in
challenging the political elite on important and taboo subjects
like race deserves our thanks.
<p>In particular, Lorna Houston displayed immense courage. Having
endured harassment, threats and disruptions by rabid leftists at
an all-candidates meeting, she stood her ground, never faltering in
the promotion of views generally regarded as unacceptable by
today's mind controllers. She is to be commended.
<p>Enclosed is $50 to help the HF carry on its important work. It's
not much compared to the huge amounts spent by our political
opponents who receive their funding from wealthy corporate donors,
and even the government. But being a working man, it's all my
budget will allow.
<p>M1E
<p><i>The ineptness of our current leaders assures the growth of the HF</i>

<h1>Light at the End of The Tunnel</h1>
<h2> Act of Bravery Leads to Assault Conviction</h2>
<p><strong>By Gerry Lincoln</strong>
<p><i>with files from Jean Morrison</i>

<p>Following numerous acquittals over the past eighteen months on
various political harassment charges, Wolfgang Droege faced the
final hurdle during a four-day trial in February.
<p>Droege, along with Peter Mitrevski, was charged in June 1993
following a late-night brawl with leftists in Toronto's west end.
Droege faced one count of aggravated assault and one of "weapons
dangerous" - a heavy-duty flashlight. Mitrevski was similarly
charged with "weapons dangerous" for being in possession of a
wooden stick which he had wrested from the grasp of a wild-eyed
anti-racist during the melee.
<p>The brawl was the culmination of an orgy of violence initiated by
members of a group of radical leftists, feminists and militant
lesbians known as the ARA (Anti-Racist Action) on the evening of
June 11. A howling mob of these moronic misfits had descended on
the rented home of Gary Schipper, trashing it while police looked
on.
<p>At the exhortation of Grant Bristow - and it didn't take much
urging - about forty Front supporters headed to Sneaky Dee's, a
renowned leftist hangout, to show the "anti-racists" that they
would not be intimidated.
<p>After staying for one drink, just long enough to make their point,
the HF members left in a group.
<p>But somehow 17-year-old Adrian Galinas became separated from his
friends and found himself facing a mob of about forty jeering
leftists. Police looked the other way, Galinas testified, as he was
kicked and beaten by the out-of-control rabble.
<p>Beaten and bloodied, the young man approached an officer, telling
him that he needed medical attention. He was informed by the
disdainful cop, "the hospital's that way. I suggest you start
walking."
<p>Meanwhile, Droege, Mitrevski and Max French had been circling the
block in an effort to make sure that everyone had evacuated the
area safely. They spotted what Max French referred to as a
"homicide in progress." Abandoning his vehicle in the middle of the
street and grabbing his flashlight, Droege and his friends jumped
into the fray.
<p>He was immediately accosted by a six-foot-six, bottle-wielding
dunderhead with a leering, slack-jawed grin and a vacant stare. The
ponytail-bedecked lout struck Droege a smashing blow to the side of
the head. Droege retaliated with a precisely-aimed wallop with his
flashlight to his antagonist's jaw - a blow which sent "Baby Huey"
into dreamland.
<p>At his trial, it was to become a point of contention whether
Droege had struck his assailant once or twice.
<hr>
<p>Over twenty months had passed since that crazy night of June 11th
1993. In sharp contrast to earlier court appearances, police
outnumbered both HF and leftist supporters as Droege and Mitrevski
made their way into the Federal Court building on Toronto's
University Avenue.
<p>Droege's lawyer, Harry Doan, began by asking judge David McCombs to
delay the case until CSIS spy Grant Bristow could be located to
testify. 
<p>"He's absolutely vital. He was there," Doan stated.
<p>To back up the defence claim, they played a portion of the <i>Best of
Bristow</i> tape, where Bristow urges supporters to confront their
opponents head on. 
<p>This evidence failed to convince the judge of
the need for Bristow to testify, but it did spark interest in the
latest HF video release. Outside the courthouse, sales of <i>In His
Own Words: The Best of Bristow</i> were brisk.
<p>George Wootten, Peter Mitrevski's lawyer added, "we've tried to
locate him," and speculated that Bristow is possibly in some sort
of witness protection program. The judge denied their request for
an adjournment and ordered the trial to proceed.
<p>The first Prosecution (Crown) witness was Detective Constable Paul
Cummins of the Metro Police, who testified that Wolfgang Droege was
the man he saw beating anti-racist Malcolm Sheppard with a
flashlight. Cummins stated under oath that Droege had hit the
victim after he had already fallen to the ground. Droege vehemently
denied the allegation, claiming he only hit the man once. The
officer testified that he arrested Mr. Droege shortly thereafter.
Other police evidence indicated that the anti-racists were well-
armed with empty liquor bottles and other potential weapons.
<p>On the second day, ARA supporter Malcolm Sheppard took the witness
stand. Sheppard, who stated he is a Grade 12 student, is a hulking
22-year-old with an admitted learning disability. (No kidding!)
<p>Defence lawyer Harry Doan, while cross-examining Sheppard, asked
incredulously, "You're 22 and in Grade Twelve?"
<p>"What can I say? I'm a slow learner," Sheppard responded
flippantly.
<p>In a surprise turn of events, the next witness to give evidence
was a strange individual named Darren Fox.
<p>The prosecution attorney announced that Fox feared retribution and
would be testifying in disguise. He also wanted to testify behind
a screen.
<p>Doan countered, "He can testify with a bag over his head for all
I care." Judge McCombs ruled that a wig would be fine.
<p>And what a wig it was!
<p>An unshaven Fox entered the courtroom, wearing a trenchcoat that
would have made Columbo look like a fashion model. His "wig" - a dilapidated 
Marilyn Monroe-style hairpiece thatlooked as though it had been left outdoors 
at the mercy of the elements for at least a couple of weeks - caused the entire court
to convulse with laughter.
<p>"That certainly is a wig," Judge McCombs remarked.
<p>When asked to describe his occupation, Fox mumbled incoherently,
raising his voice only when saying the words "law enforcement."
Asked to repeat his answer, it turns out he is employed as a
"private parking enforcement officer." His employment was never
confirmed, one way or the other.
<p>Fox testified that he saw a man beating a defenceless individual
with a flashlight. "He has a goatee," he muttered, "not very
attractive."
<p>"What did you say," the judge asked, "did you say not very
attractive?"
<p>Darren Fox replied uncomfortably, "I mean the tie ...(pause)...the
tie he's wearing."
<p>After another police officer testified regarding Mitrevski's
activities, it was the defence team's turn.
<p>Max French took the stand, telling the court how he and his
comrades had been driving away from Sneaky Dee's when he came upon
what he described as a "homicide in progress."
<p>Following French`s testimony, most of the anti-racists left the
courtroom, allowing, as one observer noted, "a breath of fresh air
to enter the premises."
<hr>
<p>The ill-behaved contingent of leftist rabble had behaved boorishly
from the onset. In contrast to most of the HF people who were
neatly attired for the occasion, the ARA bunch, with one exception,
presented a sorry spectacle.
<p>The most presentable among them, a left-wing activist named Kevin
Thomas, had been having a conversation with an out-of-town print
journalist, when the hideous Katrin Clouse, a loathsome creature
with the mouth of an unflushed toilet, approached and demanded of
the bewildered author, "why don't you fuck off?"
<p>He was stunned by her remark. "Oh boy." he said, "they sure are
hateful. What did I do?"
<p>His crime? He had been seen shaking Wolfgang Droege's hand and
chatting with Heritage Front supporters in a friendly manner.
<p>"He's now diseased! He shook Wolfgang's hand," the foul-mouthed
Clouse continued to shriek, to anyone who would listen.
<p>An amused Wolfgang grinned when told of her puerile outburst.
<p>Back at the CIUT studios, Kevin Thomas and his amigos devoted half
their Upper Cut radio show to news of the ongoing trial. His most
cutting remark was a comment that Wolfgang seems to be getting a
little "wide" lately.
<p>Once again, Wolfgang chuckled.
<hr>
<p>Next, young Adrian Galinas took the stand, essentially repeating
testimony he had given in the earlier trial of Chris Newhook. He
told of fearing for his life as he was attacked by the out-of-control 
mob and rabid anti-racists. The clean-cut youth also
related how, when he had asked police for assistance, he had been
pointed in the direction of a hospital and told to "start walking."
<p>Droege took the stand in his own defence. Not given to short
answers, he described at length events leading to the melee and
the subsequent skirmish which led to his arrest. As evidence, he
introduced his bloodied shirt and pictures of his injuries.
<p>Up next, Peter Mitrevski described much the same scene, and told
the court how he had wrestled a stick from his attacker, only to be
charged with the possession of that stick as a weapon later.
<p>George Burdi, of RaHoWa, confirmed that HF members had gone to
Sneaky Dee's at Bristow's insistence to "save face." The prosecutor
suggested that Front members were spoiling for a fight. Burdi
retorted, "Our five or six security men were the biggest and
strongest of the bunch. If we were looking for a fight, we wouldn't
have left."
<hr>
<p>With all the evidence in, it was time for summations.
<p>The Crown Attorney, reflecting on Droege's testimony, stated, "All
his answers were speeches. I don't know if I ever did get a
straight answer to some of my questions. Just speeches!"
<p>Justice McCombs, commenting on Mitrevski's case, remarked, "I'm
quite sure a person, having taken a stick from his attacker,
wouldn't take it and then lay it down on the sidewalk."
<p>While <i>Toronto Sun</i> reporter Bill Dunphy had earlier told
Droege outside the courtroom, "I found his [Darren Fox's] testimony
quite credible," apparently McCombs disagreed. He referred to Fox
as "bizarre" and questioned his mental stability.
<p>While admonishing Mitrevski for his failure to recognize the
seriousness of the proceedings, the judge nevertheless acquitted
the duo of the "weapons dangerous" charge.
<p>Droege's conviction for aggravated assault seemed to hinge on
whether or not he had struck Sheppard more than once. The judge
chose to believe police testimony.
<p>Sentencing is set for March 9th.
<P>

<h1>Love Your Race?</h1>
<h2>Then You've Got a <i>Heart of Hate</i></h2>

<strong>By Robby Vee</strong>

<p><i>Editor's note: When Peter Raymont's documentary aired on February
28th, we wanted someone to review it from at least arm's length,
someone who didn't appear in the film and hadn't even met the
producers. The hope was to minimize any bias, one way or the other.
Seventeen-year-old Robby Vee, one of our most promising young writers,
came through on a moment's notice. Hopefully, this is what the
average thinking White student saw.</i>

<p>What do you get when you throw together fifty-three minutes of
spooky background music, ominous-sounding narration, slow-motion
clips of street fights, and skillfully edited interviews with
Racialists?
<p>If you're a liberal supporter of the Establishment, you get yet
another entry in the seemingly endless parade of pseudo-documentaries 
attempting to discredit White Nationalists.
<p> But, if you're a Racialist, you get a nationwide advertisement for
people to join the Heritage Front.
<p> <i>Hearts of Hate: The Battle for Young Minds</i> aired on the last day
of February, a day I imagine many Racialists rue, as the film dwelt
on some of the seamier aspects of our movement. For one hour, the
viewer was treated to director Peter Raymont's droning alarmism, as
he recounted the movement's activities throughout the past few
years. Claims that White pride and love are really hate were
repeated ad nauseam, like some left-wing mantra. The film was
peppered with clever propaganda techniques, skillful cutaways and
a preoccupation with the isolated incident of violence that have
occurred - and always with provocation - from time to time.
<p> Did this slick System offering deal a dangerous blow to the
credibility of the Heritage Front and organized racialism?
<p> I don't think so. Not really.
<p> Personally, I think that such national media coverage, however
biased, with the potential of reaching every household in Canada,
is not a liability to the Front, but an asset. Seriously, could any
of us buy this kind of exposure? What began as a grassroots
articulation of discontent has just been presented to the whole
country! How many viewers watched, and said "hey, they're right!"
<p> Of course it would have been interesting to hear the full story
behind the Heritage Front, but I suppose petty details such as
truth are much too difficult for the left-wing media to deal with.
Nevertheless, one glaring omission stands out. Raymont skillfully
avoids pointing out the fact that it was the anti-racists who
incited the riot in Ottawa after the pro-White concert. What was
never shown was how the HF crowd had been goaded into retaliating
for hours before they finally were forced to take action to defend
themselves. Since Raymont had already assumed the anti-racists were
the "good guys" in this altercation, no doubt the fact that the
left-wing "ARA" outnumbered and began harassing the peaceful
contingent of Racialist is something that the viewing public
doesn't have to know.
<p> Mr. Raymont certainly has to repeat himself to convince us that
the Heritage Front is inherently violent. The shot of the Ottawa
confrontation is played twice in the program, and second time, the
ARA's Alicia Reckzin is heard saying, "once you kick someone in the
head for being Black, I don't think you can recover from that."
<p> Remarkable insight, Alicia, but you seem to forget that Graves is
White, as was everyone else involved in the melee on Parliament
Hill. And it was only scummy Marxist Whites who bore the brunt of
HF wrath outside Sneaky Dee's after they had trashed Gary
Schipper's home on June 11th.
<p>Both times the incident in Ottawa - actually only a few seconds
long - was shown in slow-motion, rendered in a surreal digital
gloss, with a low, eerie soundtrack accompanying the action. While
it makes sense from a propagandist's point of view to keep
repeating something that you want your audience to remember, one
must question Mr. Raymont's resources, or lack thereof. Surely he
could have found more examples if we're all just spoiling for
battle! After all, I am told that he was given complete access to
all recorded Front material by the Front itself.
<p>Unfortunately for the aforementioned ARA, Raymont does find other
examples of violence, but few indicating Racialists. The anti-
racists' cheap-shot vandalism of Gary Schipper's house is included,
and even though Raymont excuses this "raw street action" as taking
the law into their own hands, it is obvious that the ARA is far
more prone to hatred and violence than even the gruffest of
skinheads.
<p> <i>Hearts of Hate</i> doesn't spend much time explaining that when
Wolfgang Droege leapt into the subsequent College Street brawl, it
was to save the life of a young Front supporter who was being
attacked by a howling mob of bottle-wielding leftwing fanatics.
<p> True to his sensationalist industry, Raymont finds it more
important to lovingly describe the physiological details of
Droege's "assault" with gory musings on broken jaws and heavy
flashlights.
<p> In what we can only guess is an attempt at fairness, <i>Hearts of Hate</i>
allows several key Racialists to speak their views to some extent,
but it cannot resist interrupting them with narrative voice-overs
on how anything heard is actually a "racist myth," "bogus notion"
or that classic standby, "hate."
<p>As usual, the lack of arguments as to just why Racialism is so
invalid, are compensated for by plenty of name-calling and visual
effects. In one memorable segment, Raymont's elitism comes to the
forefront, as he refers to Wolfgang Droege's love of intellectual
freedom as "populist rhetoric of freedom of speech."
<p> Right Peter, why would anyone need to think for themselves, when
we have speech codes to tell us what is desirable and what isn't?
<p> The negative connotation added to the word "populist," which
normally refers to a political movement born of the common man, is
extremely revealing. It seems our "democratic" government can't
even keep its contempt for the Majority out of the very propaganda
aimed at the Majority.
<p> Fortunately, the charisma of our tireless activists shines
through. Though Raymont seems to delight in cutting off their
opinions in mid thought, what we do hear, especially from Droege
and Schipper, is rational and tempered, yet exciting and
passionate. Who could fail to admire - and agree with - Droege's
forthrightness when he said, "You may attack someone's house, but
you're not going to intimidate us. If someone seeks to harm me, or
commit violence against me, I don't think I want to turn the other
cheek."
<p> If the Left was trying to make the Heritage Front's leadership
look hateful and ignorant, it failed miserably! From the clips and
soundbites <i>Hearts of Hate</i> does afford our comrades, it becomes
abundantly clear that Racialism is on the side of the honest,
hardworking White Canadian, and that the government has lost all
touch with its subjects.
<p> No doubt the leftists are celebrating the many shots of Front
members giving the Sieg Heil salute. I can hear our enemies now:
What a shattering expose! How can the Heritage Front deny being a
fascist organization when such salutes are so commonplace?
 Well, an editorial comment in the March 1993 edition of Up Front
summed it up best. Such displays by young Front members are "merely
their way of expressing admiration for the only party in recent
history which put Race above all else."
<p> Sieg Heil salutes may not endear their presenters to the sellout
Establishment, but they undeniably give some factions of our
movement a sense of unity, cohesion and energy. I myself do not
apologize for any symbol, no matter how abrasive to mainstream
society, which serves to band together those who would fight for
their Race. If cries of "White Power" are too extreme for some
fellow Whites, well, they can go wring their hands with the likes
of the Reform Party or some other flock of weak little lambs.
<p>Yes, the Front has its radicals, its extremists, those who
understand only too well that if the System was just going to give
us back our land, it would have done so decades ago. If the rest of
White society wasn't so damned complacent, maybe we wouldn't have
today's problems of racial and national strife.
<p> In the holier-than-thou sanctimony that characterizes virtually
every media "examination" of White Nationalism, <i>Hearts of Hate</i>
loses any last shred of objectivity. Raymont makes no attempt
whatsoever to examine why Racialism is growing so strongly.
Instead, he contents himself with labelling all critics of racial
Marxism as ignorant savages. His film attacks White pride so
vehemently and without restraint that those not yet indoctrinated
by the Left must be wondering, "What is all the fuss about?"
<p>The truth is the System fears us because we are the only real
threat to its power, but the White masses, oppressed by crushing
over-taxation, ridiculous and suicidal immigration policies, not to
mention stifling political correctness, are just beginning to see
the light.
<p>Among the hundreds of thousands of viewers who watched Peter
Raymont's made-to-garner-sweeps-week-ratings effort, undoubtably
many of them sympathized with our struggle and question the
motives of the government and its minions in vilifying us.
<p>And thanks to <i>Hearts of Hate</i>, that light - however distorted by
Raymont's lens, just got a little brighter.

<hr>
<h2>Sometimes You Just Can't Win</h2>

<p>While many in the Racialist camp have been quick to criticize
Peter Raymont's made-for-TV effort <i>Hearts of Hate</i>, it didn't sit
too well with the leftists either.
<p>Dyed-in-the-wool liberal Joey Slinger, a mud-slinging, muddled-
thinking scribe who suffers from an unfortunate disability - he
actually believes people care what he thinks - whined that the film
was "pro-racist propaganda."
<p>He lamented that anti-racists are presented [in the film] as
"doddering goofs or hysterical urchins." Sounds like an accurate
portrayal to us.
<p>Slinger complains about the film's "lack of balance." Funny, he's
never worried about "balance" when writing his own left-leaning
drivel.
<p>A note at the bottom of his piece states:
"Slinger's column appears Thursday and Saturday."
... Why?

<P>

<H1>Zentrale Thesen des dritten Weges</H1>

<H2>1. Von der Unvermeidlichkeit der Revolution.</H2>

Betrachtet man die Geschichte der Ideologien aus dialektischer Sicht, so
wird es offensichtlich, ja unvermeidlich, da&szlig; das herrschende
materialistische Weltbild mit seinen beiden &Auml;u&szlig;erungsformen Kommunismus und
Kapitalismus durch etwas <EM>neues</EM> ersetzt werden mu&szlig;.<p>

Die Dialektik ist ein menschlicher Denkproze&szlig:, wonach etwas, das als schlecht
erkannt wurde, am besten durch sein Gegenteil, das dann ja gut sein sollte,
ersetzt werden mu&szlig;. So trat an die Stelle des Hauptprinzips Geist, das durch
die Kirche vor der Franz&ouml;sischen Revolution repr&auml;sentiert wurde, die Materie.
Diesseitiges Denken ersetzte jenseitiges Denken. Die Weltabgewandtheit, die
Vergeistigung des ganzen Lebens, die totale Bindung der Menschen wurde
durch ihr genaues Gegenteil abgel&ouml;st. Weltbejahung, die Naturwissenschaften,
Bindungslosigkeit waren die grundlegenden Stichworte des neu auftretenden
Materialismus.<p>

<H4>Zwei Seiten  einer Medaille</H4>

Dieser erreichte einen ersten H&ouml;hepunkt im Fr&uuml;h- oder Manchesterkapitalismus.
Die Widerspr&uuml;che, das tiefe menschliche, vor allem materielle Elend, das
diese Form des Kapitalismus ausl&ouml;ste, versuchte Marx dadurch aufzuheben,
indem er die eine Form des Materialismus, den Kapitalismus durch eine andere
Form des Materialismus, den Kommunismus ersetzte. Dabei orientierte er sich
an der Hauptwiderspruchslinie Arbeit/Kapital, die er im Sinne der Arbeit
aufzul&ouml;sen versuchte. Da der Kapitalismus das Elend verursachte, mu&szlig;te sein
Gegenprinzip, eben der sp&auml;ter nach ihm benannte Marxismus das Elend der
Menschen verhindern. <EM>Und genau das trat nicht ein</EM>. Woraus zu schlu&szlig;folgern
ist, da&szlig; sowohl Kommunismus als auch Kapitalismus <EM>falsche</EM> Wege sein m&uuml;ssen.
Beide Ideologien l&ouml;sten nicht die entscheidenden Probleme der Menschheit.
Sowohl auf materiellem Gebiet als auch noch viel mehr auf geistigem Gebiet.<p>

<H4>Der Dritte Weg</H4>

Konsequent weitergedacht bedeutet das, da&szlig; nur ein Dritter Weg jenseits von
Kapitalismus und Kommunismus <EM>und</EM> jenseits von einseitiger Orientierung an
Materialismus und Geist/Spiritualismus die Probleme der Zukunft l&ouml;sen kann.
In den Begriffen These/Antithese und Synthese gedacht bedeutet dies, da&szlig;
der <EM>Dritte Weg</EM> die Synthese aus der These Franz&ouml;sische Revolution und ihrer
Antithese Feudalismus sein mu&szlig;. Gleichzeitig mu&szlig; der <EM>Dritte Weg</EM>, verengt man
den Begriff auf die rein materielle Seite, die Synthese aus der These
Kapitalismus und ihrer Antithese Kommunismus sein. Der Widerspruch
Arbeit/Kapital mu&szlig; so aufgel&ouml;st werden, da&szlig; keine der beiden Seiten
unterdr&uuml;ckt wird. In diesem Zusammenhang ist es schwer zu leugnen, da&szlig; die
betont soziale Form der Marktwirtschaft obigen Widerspruch zwar nicht
aufgel&ouml;st, ihn aber, zumindest was die am h&ouml;chsten entwickelten L&auml;nder
betrifft, zu einem <EM>Nebenwiderspruch</EM> heruntergestuft hat. Der <EM>Hauptwiderspruch</EM>
wird sich daher an dem Widerpsruchspaar Materie/Geist orientieren.<p>

Was hat das freilich mit Revolution zu tun? Der offensichtliche Niedergang
des Marxismus-Leninismus und der scheinbare Endsieg des Liberalkapitalismus
bedeutet, da&szlig; der Widerspruch Arbeit/Kapital zun&auml;chst im Sinne des Kapitals -
trotz aller sozialer Begleitma&szlig;nahmen - <EM>prinzipiell</EM> aufgel&ouml;st wurde.
Gleichzeitig zeigt die allt&auml;gliche Realit&auml;t, da&szlig; der Kapitalismus <EM>niemals</EM> in
der Lage ist, alle menschlichen Probleme, geistig oder materiell zu
beseitigen. Das <EM>kann</EM> er ja auch nicht, da er nur die eine Seite der Medaille,
die eine Seite des Widerspruchspaares, nur die These einer Antithese, mithin
lediglich ein kleineres &Uuml;bel ist. Aber er ist eben ein &Uuml;bel, das <EM>nur</EM> durch
eine neue Synthese, eben den <EM>Dritten Weg</EM> ersetzt werden kann.<p>

<H4>Jenseits, nicht in der Mitte</H4>

Zusammengefa&szlig;t k&ouml;nnen wir sagen, da&szlig; der <EM>Dritte Weg</EM> in der Hauptsache die
Synthese aus Geist/Materie, in der Nebensache die Synthese aus Arbeit/Kapital,
unvermeidlich und revolution&auml;r sein wird. Derjenige wird an der <EM>vordersten
Front</EM> der zuk&uuml;nftigen Entwickling stehen, der das als erster begreift und
die richtige Synthese definiert. Es ist daher v&ouml;llig absurd,  den <EM>Dritten
Weg</EM> als "links" oder "rechts", als "antikommunistisch" bzw.
"prokommunistisch" usw. einzuordnen. Der <EM>Dritte Weg</EM> liegt nicht zwischen,
sondern jenseits all solcher Einordnungsversuche.<p>

<H2>2. Der DRITTE WEG orientiert sich an dem Widerspruchspaar Identit&auml;t/Entfremdung.</H2>

Diese These schlie&szlig;t sich logisch und konsequent an die erste These an. Der
in den am h&ouml;chsten entwickelten kapitalistischen Staaten erreichte materielle
Wohlstand hat es, trotz aller sozialer Ungerechtigkeiten und unbestreitbarer
Armut breiter Bev&ouml;lkerungsschichten, dazu gebracht, da&szlig; der seit dem Beginn
des 19.Jahrhunderts existierende <EM>Hauptwiderspruch</EM> Arbeit/Kapital zum
<EM>Nebenwiderspruch</EM> geworden ist. Niemand in den besprochenen L&auml;ndern mu&szlig;
verhungern, die absolute, "zum Himmel schreiende" Armut ist, nimmt man eine
Handvoll Asozialer aus, die es in <EM>jeder</EM> Gesellschaft unter allen denkbaren
Umst&auml;nden geben wird, eine Erscheinung der Vergangenheit. Niemand, der seine
f&uuml;nf Sinne halbwegs zusammen hat, ist in der Gefahr, tagt&auml;glich um sein
blankes &Uuml;berleben k&auml;mpfen zu m&uuml;ssen. Das hei&szlig;t nat&uuml;rlich nicht, da&szlig; es keine
sehr Armen gibt - man denke nur an die Empf&auml;nger von Mindestrenten oder
berufslose, alleinerziehende M&uuml;tter. Aber nochmal, selbst diese
Personenkreise sind sozial so abgesichert, da&szlig; sie zu keiner Zeit um ihr
nacktes Leben f&uuml;rchten m&uuml;ssen, zumindest aus rein materieller Sicht nicht.
Bilder von verhungernden Kindern, verkr&uuml;ppelten Jammergestalten, deren Bett
die Stra&szlig;e ist, beschr&auml;nken sich auf die Dritte Welt. Das ist nat&uuml;rlich ein
gewisser Erfolg des Kapitalismus, und es w&auml;re unrealistisch, dies zu
leugnen und davon zu faseln, die Arbeiterklasse habe nichts au&szlig;er ihren
Ketten zu verlieren. Sie hat eben schon etwas zu verlieren, n&auml;mlich einen
wenn auch noch so bescheidenen Wohlstand.<p>

<H4>Was ist das - Identit&auml;t?</H4>

Der Mensch lebt nicht nur vom Brot allein! Diese uralte Erkenntnis des
Menschen gilt immer dann, wenn das Individuum nicht all seine Energien,
seine Kraft und seine Intelligenz in die blo&szlig;e Nahrungsbeschaffung stecken
mu&szlig;. Wenn also Platz bleibt, &uuml;ber Sinn und Zweck des Lebens, &uuml;ber den
Unterschied zum nur instinktiv handelnden Tier nachzudenken, wenn also die
Frage nach der eigenen Identit&auml;t gestellt wird. Es ist schlichtweg
unbestreitbar, da&szlig; praktisch alle Menschen in den erw&auml;hnten L&auml;ndern diese
Frage stellen k&ouml;nnen. Es geht um Bereiche wie Heimat, Geborgenheit in der
Familie, der Dorfgemeinschaft oder des Stadtviertels. Es geh&ouml;rt dazu das
Zugeh&ouml;rigkeitsgef&uuml;hl zu einem gr&ouml;&szlig;eren Kollektiv, dem eigenen Berufsstand,
dem Stamm und dem Volk und schlie&szlig;lich der Rasse. Aber auch die Geborgenheit
in einem jenseitigen Ganzen, einer Religion, also die Orientierung an
metaphysischen, &uuml;berirdischen M&auml;chten geh&ouml;rt dazu. Verk&uuml;rzt k&ouml;nnte man dies
als die geistige Identit&auml;t des Menschen definieren. Identit&auml;t bedeutet Heimat,
es ist der Platz des Dazugeh&ouml;rens, der Bindung, der Verankerung. Der Sinn des
Lebens wird erfahrbar, Geborgenheit erlebbar, das nennt man Menschsein, die
M&ouml;glichkeit vollendetes Gl&uuml;ck zu empfinden. Begriffe wie Liebe und Ha&szlig;, Mut,
W&uuml;rde und Ehre, Feigheit und Opportunismus werden mit konkretem Leben erf&uuml;llt.
Wer keine Identit&auml;t besitzt, liebt alle Menschen (bzw. ha&szlig;t alle Menschen),
was aber in der Realit&auml;t nur bedeutet, da&szlig; er <EM>niemand</EM> liebt, da&szlig; 
<EM>ihn</EM> niemand
liebt. Nirgends w&auml;chst er &uuml;ber sich hinaus, er riskiert nichts, er lebt
freudlos in den Tag hinein. Er fl&uuml;chtet sich in die Ersatzwelt der Drogen,
des Alkohols, des k&uuml;nstlichen Nervenkitzels (Filme, Videos, exotische Reisen
usw.) synthetischer Stimmulantien (Musik aus der Konserve, Gaumenkitzel,
Sexismus usw.). Der identit&auml;tslose  Mensch lebt wie derjenige, der st&auml;ndig
unter dem Einflu&szlig; von Psychopharmaka steht: Alle Emotionen sind weggefiltert
bzw. m&uuml;ssen k&uuml;nstlich aufbereitet werden.<p>

<H4>Der Stolz des Kriegers</H4>

Der Entfremdete kann sich nicht &uuml;ber die Geburt eines Kindes freuen, weil
ihm der seelische Bezug fehlt. Er kapiert nicht, da&szlig; das Ansehen innerhalb
seiner Gemeinschaft, das er durch eine mutige Tat erreichen w&uuml;rde,
tausendmal sch&ouml;ner w&auml;re und viel l&auml;nger anhalten w&uuml;rde als die Freude &uuml;ber
noch so viel Geld. Der <EM>Krieger</EM>, der das &Uuml;berleben seines Stammes, seiner
Familie sichert, empfindet unendlich mehr Stolz und Gl&uuml;ck als der S&ouml;ldner,
der um materieller Vorteile willen, ihm unbekannte Menschen umbringt, die
f&uuml;r ihn ohne Bezug sind. Der <EM>Weise</EM>, der durch einen geschickten Schachzug
sein Volk aus der Umklammerung des Feindes l&ouml;st, der durch eine geniale
Erfindung ein Dorf vor der &Uuml;berschwemmung oder einen Landstrich vor einer
Seuche rettet, dieser Weise hat es nicht n&ouml;tig, da&szlig; ihm die Macht per
Abstimmung oder durch bombastische Titel best&auml;tigt wird. Nein, dieser
Weise wird zum Tr&auml;ger der Macht, ohne sie angestrebt zu haben. Sie f&auml;llt ihm
zu wegen seiner Taten, seiner Weisheit, seiner Gerechtigkeit. Seine Macht ist
gut, sie ist nat&uuml;rlich, denn sie ist Produkt hohen Ansehens, das er beim Volk
genie&szlig;t. Nie wird er diese Macht mi&szlig;brauchen oder gewaltsam verteidigen, denn
seine Macht ist so nat&uuml;rlich wie der Wechsel der Jahreszeiten und keiner, dem
Ehre und W&uuml;rde etwas bedeuten, w&uuml;rde sie in Zweifel ziehen. Der <EM>Handwerker</EM>
zieht Befriedigung aus der Sch&ouml;nheit seiner Produkte und dem Lob der K&auml;ufer,
das Geld dient ihm lediglich zum materiellen &Uuml;berleben. Denn eine
<EM>Gesellschaft in der Harmonie</EM> funktioniert nat&uuml;rlich nur dann, wenn niemand
in materieller Not leben mu&szlig;. Askese und m&ouml;nchische Weltabgewandtheit sind
ebenso Irrwege und Kennzeichen einer gest&ouml;rten pers&ouml;nlichen Identit&auml;t. Der
Asket ist st&auml;ndig auf der Suche danach, w&auml;hrend derjenige, der den
Widerspruch Identit&auml;t/Entfremdung zugunsten der Identit&auml;t aufgel&ouml;st hat,
dieses Menschsein, das vornehmste Ziel des Lebens, selbst lebt.<p>

<H4>In die Apokalypse (Weltende)?</H4>

Wer am Beispiel des Kriegers/S&ouml;ldners, des Weisen/Politikers oder des
Handwerkers/Flie&szlig;bandarbeiters gesehen hat, wie weit wir vom Ideal eines
selbstbestimmten Lebens entfernt sind, der ist in der Lage, aus der
materialistischen Raserei aufzuwachen und &uuml;berhaupt zu erkennen, da&szlig; es
diesen Widerspruch gibt. Und diese Entfremdung, diese Entgeistigung der
Menschen droht uns mit Riesenschritten in Richtung des Welteinheitsstaates,
der Welteinheitsreligion zu dr&auml;ngen. Und damit in die endg&uuml;ltige Katastrophe,
in die Apokalypse. Wo immaterielle Werte fehlen, &ouml;ffnet man der Raserei und
dem Wahnsinn T&uuml;r und Tor.<p>

<H4>Zwei Entwicklungen</H4>

Gegenw&auml;rtig beobachten wir zwei gegenl&auml;ufige Entwicklungen, eine f&uuml;r
vorrevolution&auml;re Situationen charakteristische Erscheinung. Einerseits
greift die Entfremdung immer weiter um sich, werden mehr und mehr Menschen
zu Nirgendwomenschen bzw. Weltb&uuml;rgern, die &uuml;berall und zugleich nirgends
zuhause sind. Die multikulturelle Gesellschaft, dieser Kampfbegriff zur
Entwurzelung, zur Entortung der Menschen wird von den Herrschenden, die an
einer identit&auml;tslosen Einheitsmasse und -rasse von Konsumidioten gr&ouml;&szlig;tes
Interesse haben, mit wachsendem Fanatismus eingesetzt. Andersdenkende, die
sich ihr Anderssein, ihre Eigenheit, ihre Identit&auml;t bewahren wollen, werden
einem massiven Psychoterror durch die allgegenw&auml;rtigen Massenmedien und
einer Erziehung, deren Ziel gleichgeschaltete Hirne sind, ausgesetzt.
Abweichendes soziales, politisches und kulturelles Verhalten wird
kriminalisiert. Dissidenten werden ausgegrenzt und an die R&auml;nder der
Gesellschaft gedr&auml;ngt. Der uniformierte Welteinheitsmensch befindet sich auf
dem Vormarsch.<p>

<H4>Nationalismus und Religion</H4>

Dennoch ist das unstillbare Verlangen nach Identit&auml;t, Gemeinsamkeit und
Zugeh&ouml;rigkeit nach wie vor vorhanden. Hatte sich dieses menschliche
Urbed&uuml;rfnis fr&uuml;her in dem Bekenntnis zur eigenen Herkunft, also zum
jeweiligen Volk und/oder in der Aus&uuml;bung religi&ouml;ser &Uuml;berzeugungen
manifestiert, so wird heute auf religi&ouml;se Sekten, Esoterik oder k&uuml;nstlich
geschaffene Gemeinschaften (vor allem im teilweise hysterische Dimensionen
annehmendem Spitzensport) abgehoben. Da traditionell identit&auml;tstiftende
Bereiche kriminalisiert werden bzw. sich selbst durch v&ouml;lliges Aufgehen im
individualistischen Materialismus (hier vor allem die christlichen
Amtskirchen liquidiert haben, sucht der verzweifelte Mensch nach Auswegen,
um sein Urbed&uuml;rfnis nach Geborgenheit und Lebenssinn zu befriedigen. Das
Scheitern politischer Utopien als Identit&auml;tsersatz f&uuml;hrt wiederum zu einer
breiten  Annahme des Nationalismus als einem Zentrum menschlicher Sinngebung.
Nach unserer Einsch&auml;tzung sind der <EM>Nationalismus und die Religion die
zentralen Fixpunkte einer spirituellen, also geistigen Lebensauffassung</EM>, die
im Gegensatz zum Materialismus steht.<p>

<H4>Lieber zuviel als zuwenig</H4>

Da auf geistigem Gebiet zur Zeit ein verheerendes Vakuum existiert, die
Menschen die spirituelle Lebensweise v&ouml;llig verlernt haben, weshalb sie
trotz materiellem Wohlstandes traurig, apathisch und freudlos sind, sind
&Uuml;bertreibungen und Ausw&uuml;chse im Zeichen spiritueller Renaissance
unvermeidlich. Fanatisierte Sektierer, vom positiven Nationalismus zum
zerst&ouml;rerischen Chauvinismus &uuml;bergehende V&ouml;lker werden in der Zukunft
verst&auml;rkt in Erscheinung treten. Irrationalit&auml;t und Emotionen werden den
vermeintlich rationalen Materialismus abl&ouml;sen. Ein zentraler Begriff des
<EM>Dritten Weges</EM> ist die Vorstellung der <EM>Ausgeglichenheit</EM>. Ausgeglichenheit
zwischen Geist und Materie, zwischen Rationalit&auml;t und Emotion, zwischen
Leidenschaft und Vernunft ist unser Ziel. Da aber im Zuge v&ouml;lliger
Entfremdung die Menschen riesige geistige Defizite haben bzw. die geistige
Dimension des Lebens g&auml;nzlich vergessen und verlernt haben, sind selbst
&Uuml;bertreibungen und Ausw&uuml;chse der oben beschriebenen Art grunds&auml;tzlich
begr&uuml;&szlig;enswert, da sie nicht zuletzt die Sterbestunde des reinen
Materialismus einleiten werden. Denn trotz entgegenlautender Spr&uuml;che, der
Materialismus, egal ob als kapitalistische oder kommunistische Variante, ist,
da er nur einen Teil der menschlichen Wirklichkeit widerspiegelt, selbst
g&auml;nzlich irrational. Der primitive Materialismus ist auf dem besten Weg, die
Menschheit ganz rational in die Apokalypse zu st&uuml;rzen: Bev&ouml;lkerungsexplosion,
globale Umweltkatastrophen, riesige Fl&uuml;chtlingsstr&ouml;me, Verschwendung der
nat&uuml;rlichen Ressourcen, letztlich die Zerst&ouml;rung aller Lebensgrundlagen.<p>

<H4>Gr&ouml;&szlig;enwahn und Untergang</H4>

Auf die Frage, wann denn alle Menschen als gl&uuml;cklich anzusehen seien,
antwortete ein katholischer (!) Geistlicher in vollem Ernst: "Wenn es ihnen
materiell so gut geht wie uns in Mitteleuropa." Abgesehen davon, da&szlig; diese
Aussage die katholische Lehre exakt in ihr Gegenteil verkehrt, spricht aus
diesen Worten eine gr&ouml;&szlig;enwahnsinnige Arroganz. Der materielle Wohlstand der
Mehrheitsbev&ouml;lkerung in den am h&ouml;chsten entwickelten L&auml;ndern ist also das Ma&szlig;
aller Dinge! Der entfremdete Nirgendwomensch, der in steigender Hysterie
materiellen Vergn&uuml;gungen nachgiert, der immer neue Nerven- und Gaumenkitzel
ben&ouml;tigt, um sich und sein Bewu&szlig;tsein zu bet&auml;uben, der der Verursacher
obiger Katastrophen ist, wird zum Idealtypus des Menschseins erhoben. Und
alle Menschen unserer Erde m&uuml;ssen so werden wie er, ungeachtet ihrer
jahrtausendealten Kulturen, Traditionen, ihrer Lebenserfahrungen. Dieser
sich hier zeigende messianische Liberalismus, dieser wahnwitzige fanatische
Materialismus, dieses vollst&auml;ndige Leugnen <EM>aller</EM> bisherigen kulturellen und
zivilisatorischen Leistungen aller V&ouml;lker, Religionen und Rassen und deren
Ersatz durch den gleichgeschalteten Konsumidioten, der sich in Kalkutta
genauso wohl f&uuml;hlt (falls er sich &uuml;berhaupt noch wohl f&uuml;hlen kann!) wie in
New York ist die kranke Utopie einer geistesgest&ouml;rten parasit&auml;ren Klasse.
Zugleich markiert diese Wahnvorstellung den Untergang der menschlichen Art,
das Ende aller Zeiten.<p>

<H4>Entschlossener Widerstand</H4>

Erst die entschlossene, kompromi&szlig;lose Wiederbesinnung aller denkf&auml;hig
gebliebenen Menschen auf ihre Einzigartigkeit, ihr Anderssein, ihre Identit&auml;t
(national und religi&ouml;s), die sich im fundamentalistischen Kampf gegen alle
One-World-Phantasten &auml;u&szlig;ert, garantiert den Menschen auf unserem blauen
Planeten eine Zukunft als Menschen. Deshalb ist es die vornehmste Aufgabe
aller, die sich an dem <EM>Dritten Weg</EM> orientieren, den Menschen die
Wiedergewinnung der pers&ouml;nlichen und kollektiven Identit&auml;t zu erm&ouml;glichen.
Erst selbstbewu&szlig;te, stolze, mutige und w&uuml;rdige Menschen besitzen die innere,
die geistige St&auml;rke, um den Kr&auml;ften der weltweiten Arroganz und des
Gr&ouml;&szlig;enwahns entscheidend und letztlich siegreich zu widerstehen. Deshalb ist
f&uuml;r uns der Widerspruch Identit&auml;t/Entfremdung bzw. Geist/Materie zur
entscheidenden Herausforderung des ausgehenden 20.Jahrhunderts.

<H1>Schafft befreite Zonen!</H1>

Eine der Hauptthesen unserer <EM>nationalrevolution&auml;ren Position</EM> lautet, da&szlig;
Europa unzweifelhaft der Brennpunkt aller zuk&uuml;nftiger politischer
Entwicklungen sein wird. Deutschland wiederum liegt im Zentrum unseres
Kontinents, weshalb nicht viel Intelligenz dazugeh&ouml;rt, um die Vorg&auml;nge in
unserem Vaterland als besonders wichtig f&uuml;r das weitere Schicksal Europas
anzuerkennen. Schlie&szlig;lich wird Mitteldeutschland in den n&auml;chsten Jahren eine
Hauptkrisenregion nicht nur im gesamtdeutschen, sondern im gesamteurop&auml;ischen
Zusammenhang sein. Diese nicht gerade umwerfend neue Erkenntnis ist Grundlage
all unserer &Uuml;berlegungen. Einer korrekten Analyse mu&szlig; aus unserer Sicht eine
These, dieser dann eine konkrete Tat folgen. Wer das nicht einsieht, ist
politikunf&auml;hig und verkommt zum Schw&auml;tzer. Wenn also im folgenden von
<EM>befreiten Zonen</EM> die Rede ist, so wird automatisch vorausgesetzt, da&szlig; diese
Zonen in erster Linie in Mitteldeutschland zu schaffen sind.<p>

<H2>Was hei&szlig;t das - befreite Zonen?</H2>

Wir betrachten die befreiten Zonen aus <EM>militanter</EM> Sicht, also aus der Sicht
des politischen Aktivisten. Es geht keinesfalls darum, eigenst&auml;ndige
staatliche Gebilde oder &auml;hnlichen Unsinn ins Leben zu rufen. Nein, befreite
Zonen bedeutet f&uuml;r uns zweierlei. Einmal ist es die Etablierung einer
<EM>Gegenmacht</EM>. Wir m&uuml;ssen Freir&auml;ume schaffen, in denen <EM>wir</EM> faktisch die Macht
aus&uuml;ben, in denen <EM>wir</EM> sanktionsf&auml;hig sind, d.h. <EM>wir</EM> bestrafen Abweichler und
Feinde, <EM>wir</EM> unterst&uuml;tzen Kampfgef&auml;hrtinnen und -gef&auml;hrten, <EM>wir</EM> helfen
unterdr&uuml;ckten, ausgegrenzten und verfolgten Mitb&uuml;rgern. Das System, der Staat
und seine B&uuml;ttel werden in der konkreten Lebensgestaltung der politischen
Aktivisten der Stadt <EM>zweitrangig</EM>. Entscheidender wird das Verhalten derer
sein, die f&uuml;r die Sache des Volkes k&auml;mpfen, unwichtig wird das Gezappel der
Systemzwerge sein. Wir sind drinnen, der Staat bleibt drau&szlig;en. Nat&uuml;rlich
besitzen die Staatstragenden weiterhin alle M&ouml;glichkeiten der Repression, von
der Pistole und dem Wasserwerfer bis zur Abh&ouml;rwanze. Aber diese Waffen werden
stumpf, sie werden entweder nicht mehr eingesetzt, weil die <EM>Gegnmacht</EM> so
gro&szlig; geworden ist, da&szlig; offene Unterdr&uuml;ckung nicht mehr machbar, weil
unkalkulierbar geworden ist oder aber der Einsatz der
Unterdr&uuml;ckungsinstrumente wird wirkungslos. Das gilt vor allem f&uuml;r
psychologische Waffen (Abh&ouml;rwanzen, Erpressung, Existenzvernichtung, Hetze,
Kriminalisierung usw.). F&uuml;r die Volksk&auml;mpfer sind derartige Repressionen
irrelevant geworden, entscheidend wird die Solidarit&auml;t des Volkes, das
Ansehen bei den Mitk&auml;mpfern sein.<p>

Als Corneliu Codreanu Anfang der zwanziger Jahre von den Marionetten des
rum&auml;nischen Regimes vor Gericht gezerrt werden sollte, meldeten sich 20.000
(in Worten zwanzigtausend!!) Verteidiger, um ihm beizustehen. Trotz Terror,
w&uuml;ster L&uuml;gen und wilder Beschimpfungen weigerten sich <EM>alle</EM> Geschworenen,
Codreanu (er hatte zusammen mit seinen Kameraden einen Verr&auml;ter hingerichtet)
schuldig zu sprechen. Der Freispruch m&uuml;ndete in ein riesiges Volksfest, die
R&uuml;ckfahrt Codreanus in seine Heimatstadt glich einem einzigen Triumpfzug.
Obwohl das reaktion&auml;re rum&auml;nische Regime noch immer die Macht hatte,
moralisch und geistig hatte die Eiserne Garde eine solch enorme <EM>Gegenmacht</EM>
aufgebaut, da&szlig; eine Verurteilung Codreanus einen landesweiten Volksaufstand
zur Folge gehabt h&auml;tte. Und ganz entscheidend noch: jeder Rum&auml;ne, dem
Begriffe wie W&uuml;rde, Mut und Anstand etwas bedeuteten stellte sich auf die
Seite der Nationalisten. Die Systemb&uuml;ttel fielen der totalen Verachtung
anheim, niemand wollte etwas mit ihnen zu tun haben, die T&ouml;chter des
Chefankl&auml;gers weigerten sich, weiterhin zusammen mit ihrem Vater an einem
Tisch zu sitzen, sie brachten Codreanu und seinen Kameraden Geschenke ins
Gef&auml;ngnis. Diese Form der <EM>Gegenmacht</EM> ist st&auml;rker als Tausende
Maschinengewehre, Fernsehsender oder Wanzen.<p>

Zweitens bedeutet f&uuml;r uns die Schaffung befreiter Zonen eine <EM>Kl&auml;rung</EM> unter
allen revolution&auml;ren Gruppen. Indem wir die Vorherrschaft in den Herzen und
K&ouml;pfen der Menschen errungen haben, entlarven wir gleichzeitig die extreme
Linke, die NS-Nostalgiker, die Autonomen und weitere Artverwandte als
staatstragende Wirrk&ouml;pfe. Diese werden sich n&auml;mlich in der aufkommenden
Panik, die unsere auch noch so winzigen Anfangserfolge bei ihnen ausl&ouml;sen
werden, flugs in die Arme des Staates werfen. Sie werden das System um Hilfe
anbetteln, unser Verbot fordern, uns n&auml;rrische Schimpfnahmen andichten. Kurz
sie werden brav ihre Rolle als f&uuml;nfte Kolonne in den Reihen der Opposition
spielen. Die Menschen in der befreiten Zone werden sich aber kein X f&uuml;r ein U
vormachen lassen und den genannten Schreih&auml;lsen mit tiefer Verachtung
begegnen.<p>

<H2>Warum brauchen wir befreite Zonen?</H2>

Der Kampf f&uuml;r die Sache des Volkes ist ein langes und z&auml;hes Ringen um die
Herzen und Hirne der Menschen. Die Volksk&auml;mpfer brauchen Bereiche, wo sie
Kraft tanken, Zuversicht und Mut sch&ouml;pfen k&ouml;nnen. In einem Meer der
Dunkelheit brauchen sie Orte der Helle. Befreite Zonen sind aber auch Pl&auml;tze,
wo die Menschen unsere Worte an unseren Taten messen k&ouml;nnen. Sie sind
Mikrokosmen der Gemeinschaft, die wir f&uuml;r <EM>alle</EM> anstreben. Befreite Zonen in
unserem Sinn sind Bereiche, wo der zentrale Widerspruch unserer Zeit,
n&auml;mlich der Widerspruch Identit&auml;t/Entfremdung zugunsten der Identit&auml;t
aufgel&ouml;st wird. Es sind Orte der Geborgenheit, des Dazugeh&ouml;rens, der W&auml;rme,
der Solidarit&auml;t. Sie sind Heimat f&uuml;r die Heimatlosen. Befreite Zonen sind
sowohl Aufmarsch- als auch R&uuml;ckzugsgebiete f&uuml;r die Nationalisten
Deutschlands.<p>

<H2>Der Weg zur befreiten Zone</H2>

Je weniger wir von den Einrichtungen des Staates oder vom Staat und seinen
B&uuml;tteln abh&auml;ngig sind, desto mehr n&auml;hern wir uns einer Befreiten Zone. Eine
Befreite Zone ist also nicht in erster Linie geographisch definiert. Das soll
durch einige Beispiele, die durchaus Vorbildcharakter haben, erl&auml;utert
werden. Es ist ein beliebtes Mittel westlicher "Demokratien", Dissidenten
und Andersdenkende nicht einzusperren oder deren Organisationen zu verbieten,
sondern man bedient sich der wirtschaftlichen Erpressung. Abweichler werden
in den finanziellen und wirtschaftlichen Ruin getrieben bzw. es werden
ihnen entsprechende Konsequenzen angedroht, wenn sie nicht den Buckel krumm
machen und kuschen. Das Stichwort "Berufsverbot" ist dabei nur der plumpeste
Versuch seitens des Systems, die Untertanen zur Botm&auml;&szlig;igkeit zu zwingen.
Die Wirklichkeit sieht meistens anders aus. Die Abweichler werden durch die
Massenmedien so sehr verleumdet und kriminalisiert, da&szlig; der Normalb&uuml;rger, der
sich zumeist kein objektives Bild machen kann, m&ouml;glichst nichts mit diesen
"Chaoten", "Rowdies", "Extremisten", "Neonazis", "Terroristen" bzw.
"Rechtsradikalen" zu tun haben will. Private Arbeitgeber werden aus schierer
Angst vor den Medien des Systems und in der Regel <EM>wider besseres Wissen</EM>
entsprechend titulierte Mitarbeiter entlassen. Obwohl sie rein rechtlich das
oft nicht k&ouml;nnen, ein Anla&szlig; ist <EM>immer</EM> und <EM>schnell</EM> gefunden. Die Berufsverbote
in staatlichen Institutionen wurden nicht deshalb eingef&uuml;hrt, um den Staat
vor der Unterwanderung zu sch&uuml;tzen, sondern um das letzte Schlupfloch der
Dissidenten - eben den Staatsdienst, wo man Kraft des Gesetztes normalerweise
<EM>unk&uuml;dbar</EM> ist - zu schlie&szlig;en. Damit hat es das System in den westlichen
"Demokratien" in der Tat erreicht, da&szlig; f&uuml;r <EM>tats&auml;chliche</EM> Dissidenten ein
vollst&auml;ndiges Berufsverbot gilt.<p>

Zumindest solange man sich <EM>&ouml;ffentlich</EM> zum Abweichlertum bekennt. Was man
<EM>privat</EM> tut, ob man sich zuhause zehn Hitler- oder Stalinb&uuml;sten in jedes
Zimmer stellt, das interessiert niemanden, weil niemand es sieht. Man kann
also ohne weiteres privater Neonazi, Stalinist oder RAF-Fan sein, solange
man will. <EM>Der Staat versucht alles, um jede Form des Widerstandes ins 
unverbindliche, ins Private und damit letztlich ins Unpolitische abzudr&auml;ngen. 
Oder in offenkundige Sackgassen zu lenken</EM>  - es ist kein Zufall, da&szlig; Autonome
und private Neonazis offenkundig Narrenfreiheit genie&szlig;en. Noch weniger Zufall
ist es, da&szlig; man entsprechende Klamotten bereits im Kaufhaus erwerben kann.
Was kann man gegen dieses teuflische System tun? Man kann offen so
weitermachen wie bisher und als Sozialfall enden. Oder resignieren oder
Kompromisse machen. Man kann aber auch versuchen, s&auml;mtlichen
Erpressungsversuchen zu entgehen, indem man sich selbst zum Arbeitgeber
macht. Man mu&szlig; hier Sektoren abdecken, die vom Feind nicht genutzt werden
k&ouml;nnen.<p>

Hierzu einige Beispiele:<p>
Errichtung eines unabh&auml;ngigen Buchladens, wo man <EM>auch</EM> B&uuml;cher und Schriften,
Aufkleber und Flugbl&auml;tter kaufen kann, die man sonst nirgends bekommt. Keine
Angst, in jeder Region Deutschlands besteht eine gen&uuml;gend gro&szlig;e, freilich oft
v&ouml;llig isolierte Szene, so da&szlig; sich ein solcher Laden rechnet. Oder eine
Druckerei, eine Werbeagentur, ein Reiseunternehmen f&uuml;r kleine Geldbeutel. Man
kann "T-Hemden" oder Schallplatten verkaufen, es gibt tausend und eine
M&ouml;glichkeit, aus dem System auszubrechen und Kohle zu verdienen, <EM>ohne</EM> da&szlig; man
sich ruiniert oder man zum Hampelmann des Systems wird. Und keine Angst, wenn
sich Euer Laden rumgesprochen hat, wenn Eure Qualit&auml;t und Zuverl&auml;ssigkeit
&uuml;ber dem Durchschnitt liegt, die Mund zu Mundpropaganda gegriffen hat, dann
werdet ihr Euch vor Auftr&auml;gen nicht mehr retten k&ouml;nnen.
Hinzu kommt das Stichwort der <EM>Vernetzung</EM>. Gleichgesinnte Initiativen, die an
verschiedenen Orten bestehen, m&uuml;ssen engen Kontakt halten, voneinander
wissen, einander helfen. vom Telefonkontakt &uuml;ber das Fax bis zum Computer mit
Modem - auch hier gibt es keine Grenzen.

<H4>Ein Beispiel</H4>

In Leipzig wollen Aktivisten der <EM>nationalrevolution&auml;ren Position</EM> ein
fetziges, witziges und qualitativ hochstehendes Flugblatt machen. Statt zu
verzweifeln, weil man nicht einmal eine vern&uuml;nftige Schreibmaschine hat usw.,
wendet man sich an ein dem Netzwerk angeschlossenes Text- und Graphikb&uuml;ro.
Dort ruft man an bzw. faxt hin, was man will. Und schon hat man das
druckfertige Exemplar - falls man faxen kann ist das eine Sache von <EM>Stunden</EM>,
nicht von Wochen oder gar Monaten. Drucken wird man es dann &uuml;ber die dem
Netzwerk angeschlossene Druckerei. Dann schickt man das Flugi an andere
Regionale Aktionsgruppen - und siehe da, es gef&auml;llt auch den Leuten in Berlin
und in Oberbayern. <EM>Das</EM> ist Vernetzung, das ist eine <EM>befreite Zone</EM>, denn die
Produktion dieses Flugblattes kann durch nichts und niemanden aufgehalten
werden.<p>

Aber davon kann man doch nicht leben, wird eingewandt werden. Richtig, wenn
man sich nicht der n&uuml;tzlichen Idioten bedient. Es gibt zahllose Gruppen in
diesem Land, die zu dumm, zu faul sind, ein vern&uuml;nftiges Flugi zu
produzieren. Die wissen jetzt, an wen sie sich, gegen nat&uuml;rlich
abzudr&uuml;ckende Kohle, zu wenden haben. Es gibt auch sonst viele Leute (vom
Fachgesch&auml;ft vor Ort bis zum Kaninchenz&uuml;chterverein), die ein schnell
produziertes, angemessen teures Flugblatt oder auch einen Speisezettel oder
eine Werbeschrift oder was wei&szlig; ich einem teuren, langsam produzierten und
zudem schlecht gemachten &Auml;quivalent vorziehen, das von politisch
ungef&auml;hrlichen St&uuml;mpern gemacht wird. Also noch einmal, unsere Druckerei und
unser Graphik- und Textb&uuml;ro wird einmal von den Leuten leben, die meinen, uns
politisch nahezustehen und von ganz normalen Leuten, die halt Qualit&auml;t
vorziehen. Anfangs wird es sicher nur wenige solcher Einrichtungen geben,
aber wenn die Vernetzung greift, der Erfolg sich rumspricht, was oft sehr
schnell geht und wir immer mehr Bereiche des stinknormalen Lebens
"auskoppeln" und zur <EM>befreiten Zone</EM> erkl&auml;ren k&ouml;nnen, umso dichter wird das
Netz, umso professioneller unsere Arbeit, umso h&ouml;her unser Ansehen. Das
Stichwort <EM>befreite Zone</EM> mu&szlig; man noch auf zwei weitere Bereiche ausdehnen:<p>

1. Die Stra&szlig;e. Aus militanter Sicht befinden wir uns dann in einer <EM>befreiten Zone</EM>, 
wenn wir nicht nur ungest&ouml;rt demonstrieren und Info-St&auml;nde abhalten
k&ouml;nnen, sondern die Konterrevolution&auml;re dies genau <EM>nicht</EM> tun k&ouml;nnen. Dazu
mu&szlig; man sich die Orte genau ausw&auml;hlen. Es gen&uuml;gen zehn oder zw&ouml;lf
entschlossene Revolution&auml;re und WIR bestimmen, was aus militanter Sicht in
einer Stadt ist und was nicht.<p>

<H2>Alles mit dem Volk</H2>

2. Das Wohngebiet. Revolution&auml;re d&uuml;rfen nicht &uuml;ber das gesamte Stadtgebiet
zerstreut wohnen, sondern sie sollten sich m&ouml;glichst auf ein Wohnobjekt und
einen Stra&szlig;enzug konzentrieren, um vor Ort sichtbar Macht auszudr&uuml;cken. Dann
ist es unabdinglich, mit der ans&auml;ssigen Wohnbev&ouml;lkerung in <EM>intensiven</EM> Kontakt
zu treten, den Leuten immer und &uuml;berall zu helfen. Das ist &uuml;brigens der
fundamentale Unterschied zu gleichgearteten Bem&uuml;hungen der Linksextremisten.
W&auml;hrend wir <EM>mit</EM> dem Volk uns solidarisieren, mit ihm k&auml;mpfen und siegen
werden, versuchen sich die Genossen vom anderen Ufer von genau diesem Volk
abzukoppeln, sie k&auml;mpfen <EM>gegen</EM> das Volk, weshalb sie verlieren m&uuml;ssen.
Beispiele: Alten Leuten kann man beim Ausf&uuml;llen von Formularen helfen, sie
beim Einkauf unterst&uuml;tzen, man kann Babysitter bei arbeitenden Ehepaaren oder
alleinstehenden M&uuml;ttern spielen, man kann den Garten in Ordnung bringen, die
Stra&szlig;en sauber und durch regelm&auml;&szlig;ige Nachtpatroullien sicher halten. Man kann
gegen den Zuzug eines Supermarkts, die Vertreibung alteingesessener Mieter
durch Miethaie, die Schlie&szlig;ung des kleinen Eckladens, den Aufmarsch von
Scheinasylanten und anderen Lichtgestalten oder den Bau einer Autobahn durch
das Wohnviertel protestieren und agitieren. Man mu&szlig; so handeln, da&szlig; man in
einem Meer der Sympathie schwimmt, da&szlig; die "normalen" Bewohner f&uuml;r uns "die
Hand ins Feuer legen". Dann wird dem Staat jede Form der Unterdr&uuml;ckung nicht
nur nichts nutzen, sondern das genaue Gegenteil bewirken: die Menschen werden
noch st&auml;rker in unsere Arme getrieben. F&uuml;r die Menschen vor Ort werden <EM>wir</EM>
und nicht anonyme politische Strukturen und arrogante Politiker und
B&uuml;rokraten das Ma&szlig; aller Dinge sein. <EM>Wir</EM> sind die Elite dieser Wohngegend,
<EM>uns</EM> traut man zuerst, <EM>wir</EM> sind die Vorbilder und <EM>wir</EM> haben die Macht, die wir
nicht mi&szlig;brauchen, eben weil wir sie wirklich und nicht nur fiktiv haben.
Allerdings ist das soeben m&uuml;hselig erk&auml;mpfte Ansehen sehr schnell wieder
durch <EM>Unw&uuml;rdige</EM> aller Spielarten zu verspielen. Weshalb wir auf die
charakterlichen Eigenschaften unserer Mitk&auml;mpfer nicht genug Wert legen
k&ouml;nnen.<p>

<H2>Leuchtender Weg</H2>

Ist auf diese Weise einmal ein Stra&szlig;enzug - es kann nat&uuml;rlich auch ein
kleines Dorf sein - zur <EM>befreiten Zone</EM> innerhalb einer militant  befreiten
Stadt geworden, haben wir also konkrete Gegenmacht erobert, dann wird sich
dies rasend schnell herumsprechen. Dann hat der Staat nur mehr zwei
M&ouml;glichkeiten. Entweder er greift brutal durch und entlarvt sich offen als
die Diktatur, die er heimlich schon immer gewesen ist. Brutal kann hier von
Knast bis zu offenem Mord lauten (Beispiele sind hier die Ermordung Codreanus
1938 oder die blutigen Terroranschl&auml;ge Anfang der 80er Jahre in Italien -
beides angebliche Demokratien) so schafft er aber die M&auml;rtyrer, mit deren
Hilfe unsere "Enkel" umso leichter k&auml;mpfen und siegen werden. Oder aber der
Staat weicht zur&uuml;ck - erst langsam, dann im Schweinsgalopp und schlie&szlig;lich in
panikartiger Flucht. Wir sehen also, wenn wir all unseren Idealismus, unsere
Kraft, unseren Glauben und unseren Mut konzentrieren, dann k&ouml;nnen wir nur
siegen und das B&ouml;se, den Weltstaat, vernichten. Aber der Kampf wird &auml;u&szlig;erst
hart sein, viele R&uuml;ckschl&auml;ge, manchen Verrat und manche &Uuml;berraschung - gute
und b&ouml;se - bringen. Viele werden unseren <EM>leuchtenden Weg</EM> wieder verlassen,
aber andere werden dazusto&szlig;en, Verlorengeglaubte und Neugewonnene werden
diese L&uuml;cken mehr als f&uuml;llen. Aus Rinnsalen werden B&auml;che, aus B&auml;chen wird der
gro&szlig;e Strom, der alles mit sich rei&szlig;t, das sich der Sache des Volkes
entgegenstemmt. Und wir und Ihr k&ouml;nnt einmal voller Stolz sagen: <EM> Aber wir
haben die Quellen offengelegt! Wir haben das Gute in uns und im deutschen
Volk wiederentdeckt!</EM><p>

Wem der Schlu&szlig; zu pathetisch war: Jede Revolution braucht, so wie sie ihre
Flagge und ihr Symbol braucht, ihr <EM>Pathos!</EM>

<H1>Die politische Tat</H1>

Das Problem der Widerspr&uuml;che zwischen Theorie und Praxis findet seine L&ouml;sung
weniger auf dem weiten Gebiet des absoluten Moralismus und der Rechtm&auml;&szlig;igkeit
als vielmehr mit der Beantwortung der Frage: Was l&auml;&szlig;t sich heute durchsetzen?
Und vor allem wie? Das Wollen als Idealismus und das K&ouml;nnen als Realismus
m&uuml;ssen dabei keine Gegens&auml;tze sein. Ihre Gemeinsamkeit liegt in der
Arbeitsteilung - revolution&auml;rer Idealismus als Theorie und k&uuml;hler Realismus
als Praxis. Leider hat sich die enge Verbindung von situationsangepa&szlig;ter und
politisch langfristig individualistischer oder systemsprengender Haltung
durch strikte Trennung ihrer unterschiedlichen Anwendbarkeit im Lager des
europ&auml;ischen Nationalismus noch nicht ganz durchgesetzt. Stattdessen scheinen
sich &uuml;berall unn&ouml;tige Fraktionsbildungen zu vollziehen, die in dieser Sch&auml;rfe
keine Existenzberechtigung haben. Offensichtlich ist die Ursache der
Auseinandersetzungen im "rechten" Lager genau dieses Problem: Was l&auml;&szlig;t sich
wie heute durchsetzen?<p>

Die politische Tat ist nur dann sinnvoll, wenn sie Signal ist f&uuml;r
nachfolgende Taten. So mu&szlig; die erste &Uuml;berlegung des politischen T&auml;ters sein,
ob Nachfolgetaten zu erwarten sind. Nicht zuletzt deshalb bedarf es einer
intensiven, generalstabsm&auml;&szlig;igen Vorbereitung einer Tat, die abkl&auml;rt: Was tun?
Wer soll es tun? Mit welchem Ziel soll es getan werden? Welche Reaktion ist
bei den Freunden zu erwarten? Welche bei den Feinden? Welche bei den
Unentschlossenen? Eine isolierte Tat erreicht nichts oder das Gegenteil. Um
das zu vermeiden, ist es notwendig, die Praxis st&auml;rker als bisher zu
theoretisieren und die Theorie praxisn&auml;her zu machen. Die politische Tat als
Test der M&ouml;glichkeiten oder gar schon als Versuch einer Verwirklichung der
Ideale im Handeln hat zweifellos eine eingliedernde Wirkung, nur mu&szlig; das
Verhalten des T&auml;ters nach der Tat auch dem entsprechen, was die auf ihn
blickende Gruppe oder Masse erwartet; d.h. er mu&szlig; seine Rolle weiterspielen
und darf keine Pause einlegen. Deshalb mu&szlig; er auch die ideologischen
Voraussetzungen mitbringen, um die Anh&auml;nger und Sympathisanten zu binden. In
unserem Falle also mu&szlig; er konsequenter Nationalist sein.<p>

Der europ&auml;ische Nationalismus, der sich zugleich nach innen als europ&auml;ischer
Sozialismus versteht, ist eine herbeigew&uuml;nschte Realit&auml;t. Eine Realit&auml;t, die
in den K&ouml;pfen einiger weniger als ein neues geopolitisches und soziologisches
Ordnungssystem existiert. Gew&uuml;nschte Realit&auml;ten aber werden gemeinhin als
Utopien bezeichnet, und so kann es nicht ausbleiben, da&szlig; die Propheten der
jeweils aktuellen Realit&auml;t auf politische Situationen, Machtverh&auml;ltnisse oder
Verfassungen verweisen, um damit den Staatsfeind in seine Schranken zu
verweisen. Weltanschauung ist aber nicht blo&szlig; eine "Zusammenfassung der
Elemente des Weltbildes", sondern eine Zusammenfassung der Idealvorstellungen
und damit eine klare Kampfansage an die bestehenden Herrschafts- und
Ordnungsverh&auml;ltnisse. Politik schlie&szlig;lich ist nicht blo&szlig; eine "Kunst des
M&ouml;glichen", sondern die Kunst, das unm&ouml;glich erscheinende mit den Mitteln der
Theorie und Praxis m&ouml;glich zu machen. Unsere Aufgabe ist es nicht, ein Spiel
mit vorhandenen Karten zu spielen, sondern die Herstellung eines neuen
Kartenspiels, da das alte gezinkt ist.<p>

Realit&auml;ten sind nicht gottgegeben und sind keine Naturereignisse, sondern sie
sind von Menschen geschaffen und k&ouml;nnen ergo auch von Menschen wieder
beseitigt werden. Wer das verneint, ist kein politisch Denkender und
Handelnder, sondern bestenfalls ein Verwaltungsbeamter, einer, der sich in
einem gegebenen System bequem zurechtfindet. Die Ver&auml;nderlichkeit der
Realit&auml;ten durch handelnde Menschen ist die eigentliche politische Realit&auml;t.
Nur wer die Dynamik der Geschichte erkennt und anerkennt ist Realist.
Insofern ist der unbeugsame Idealist der wirkliche und einzige Realist. Das
n&auml;mlich ist das Problem vieler Konservativer: Sie sind durch ihre
"Bodenst&auml;ndigkeit" dazu verurteilt, stets in angemessener Entfernung hinter
der Entwicklung herzulaufen, skeptisch, kritisch und ein wenig pessimistisch.
Weil sie die Wandelbarkeit zwar sp&uuml;ren, aber nicht selber Ver&auml;nderungen
wollen, nicht zu planen bereit sind, den ersten Schritt ins Neuland stets
und gern den Fortschrittlichen &uuml;berlassen. Den ersten Schritt m&uuml;ssen k&uuml;nftig
wir tun.<p>

Da&szlig; sich die historischen Konstellationen &auml;ndern und verschieben, haben alle
erkannt, die sich mit Geschichte und Politik eingehend besch&auml;ftigen. Aber es
geht nicht darum, sich andere Antworten f&uuml;r andere historische Lagen
auszudenken, sondern darum, neue historische Lagen zu schaffen - nicht
anpassen lassen, sondern anpassen, nicht dem Augenblick gem&auml;&szlig; handeln,
sondern f&uuml;r die &Uuml;berwindung des augenblicklichen Zustandes arbeiten. So wird
Politik gemacht und nicht anders. Das &auml;ndert nat&uuml;rlich nichts daran, da&szlig; das
Ma&szlig; jeder Bewegung Gegenwart hei&szlig;t und Luftschl&ouml;sser, vor allem im
praktischen Bereich der Aktion, die beste Garantie f&uuml;r einen harten Fall auf
den Boden der Tatsachen sind.<p>

W&auml;hrend die Theologen um gut und b&ouml;se r&auml;tseln und die Verfassungssch&uuml;tzer
Brave und Ungezogene trennen, wird wohl die f&uuml;r den politischen Kampf allein
wichtige Frage nach richtig oder falsch zum Leidwesen der Demokratisierer
immer nur von jenen beantwortet werden k&ouml;nnen, bei denen ein hoher Grad an
Informiertheit mit nat&uuml;rlicher Intelligenz und analytischer Bef&auml;higung
zusammentrifft. Drastisch ausgedr&uuml;ckt hei&szlig;t das, da&szlig; nicht das Volk selbst
regieren, sondern nur aus dem Volk heraus regiert werden kann. Die Furcht vor
der Technokratie ist deshalb auch ziemlich zweifelhaft, weil ja gerade das
aufsteigende Zeitalter der Technik die Notwendigkeit einer im positiven Sinne
elit&auml;ren, wenngleich notwendigerweise an der Basis abgesicherten Neuordnung
signalisiert.<p>

Das gilt erst recht f&uuml;r die nationalrevolution&auml;ren Aktivisten. Schon in den
zwanziger Jahren stellte sich dieses Problem besonders der Gruppe um Ernst
J&uuml;nger, Helmut Franke und Friedrich Hielscher mit ihren Publikationen
"Standarte", "Arminius" und "Der Vormarsch", die sich als Kern eines damals
schon so benannten "Neuen Nationalismus" verstanden und daran scheiterten,
da&szlig; sie sich als unf&auml;hig erwiesen, die Idee eines modernen Nationalismus &uuml;ber
die Literatur in die Praxis hinauszutreiben. Die Ans&auml;tze ihrer Ideologie sind
von den unseren kaum zu unterscheiden, und man kann behaupten, da&szlig; die
Geschichte des heutigen "Neuen Nationalismus" Ende des Jahres 1925 begann,
als die Gruppen um J&uuml;nger den Begriff des Nationalismus f&uuml;r ihre
nationalistische, soziale und konsequent revolution&auml;re Weltanschauung
"erfanden" und erstmals propagierten.<p>

Obwohl die nationalrevolution&auml;re Bewegung damals an der Schwierigkeit
scheiterte, politisierende Intellektuelle zu organisieren, haben einige
Praktiker doch wesentliche Vorschl&auml;ge zum politischen Handeln gemacht.
Kapit&auml;n Ehrhardt schrieb im "Vormarsch" vom Juni 1928 zum Thema
"Machtpolitik": "Die politische Entwicklung aber mu&szlig; weitergetrieben werden
durch die freigewordenen revolution&auml;ren Kr&auml;fte. Ihnen wird es nicht so
schwer, wenn n&ouml;tig, einen alten Rahmen aufzugeben und sich neue Formen zu
geben. Die Mitglieder der kleinen Kampfb&uuml;nde werden sich schneller um die
ersten Zellen nationalrevolution&auml;rer Gemeinschaften im Lande sammeln bzw.
selbst solche Zellen und Gemeinschaften bilden. Die Aufgabe dieser Zellen ist
die politische Eroberung der D&ouml;rfer und St&auml;dte. Die Gemeinschaften m&uuml;ssen
ihre Leute in alle politischen Organisationen hineinschicken, in die
Bauernschaften, Gewerkschaften, Studentenschaften usw. Diese Gemeinschaften
m&uuml;ssen alle vorhandenen nationalrevolution&auml;ren Kr&auml;fte und vor allem
F&uuml;hrerpers&ouml;nlichkeiten im Lande aufsp&uuml;ren und an sich ziehen. Es ist
unm&ouml;glich, zu gleicher Zeit dem nationalrevolution&auml;ren Gedanken und der
b&uuml;rgerlichen Ordnung zu dienen." Und Ernst J&uuml;nger f&uuml;gte im "Vormarsch" vom
April 1929 unter der &Uuml;berschrift "Der unsichtbare Kern" hinzu: "Nat&uuml;rlich ist
der Nationalismus kein literarisches Sp&auml;&szlig;chen, und ebensowenig vollzieht er
sich in der Zone der reinen Idee. Sowohl seinem Charakter sowie seinem
Temperamente nach zielt er auf die Aktion; er w&uuml;rde eine weltanschauliche
Spielart bleiben, wenn er sich nicht im Tats&auml;chlichen vollenden w&uuml;rde."<p>

Beide Zitate lassen die enge Verkn&uuml;pfung von Theorie und Praxis erkennen,
ebenso die unbedingte Verkn&uuml;pfung von Nationalismus und der bestehenden
b&uuml;rgerlichen Ordnung. Keine politische Bewegung kann sich auf Dauer halten,
kann auf lange Sicht die Massen &uuml;berzeugen, wenn sie nicht konsequent ist!
Kein Politiker hat das Recht, eine Bewegung zu f&uuml;hren, wenn er nicht bereit
ist, konsequent zu handeln und entsprechend die Konsequenz seines Handelns
auf sich zu nehmen. Der Erfolg des Kampfes h&auml;ngt davon ab. Und nur so l&auml;&szlig;t es
sich vermeiden, st&auml;ndig von den Herrschenden in die "esoterischen Zirkel"
zur&uuml;ckgedr&auml;ngt, von der &Ouml;ffentlichkeit noch vor dem Beginn der
Meinungsbildung ausgespuckt zu werden. Die Ideologie selbst kann in kleinen
Kreisen und Zellen ausgearbeitet werden; das ist ja bereits geschehen. Diese
"Elite der Wissenden" - die salbungsvolle Ausdrucksweise m&ouml;ge verziehen
werden - hat sich an den Kreis der Interessierten zu wenden, die &uuml;berzeugten
Interessierten m&uuml;ssen sich dann an die Unbeteiligten wenden usw. Kreise
ziehen, nicht Sportpalast-Seelenmassage - das ist echte Untergrundarbeit.<p>

Der Begriff der "Untergrundarbeit" widerspricht schon der "realistischen"
Forderung nach Rechtm&auml;&szlig;igkeit. Nun ist es nat&uuml;rlich wieder eine Frage, ob
wir uns die Waffen unseres Kampfes von der herrschenden, politisch
benutzbaren Rechtsordnung vorschreiben lassen oder ob wir uns diese
Entscheidung selbst vorbehalten wollen. Der Unterschied liegt ausschlie&szlig;lich
im Grad des Risikos. Das Ergebnis jedoch ist eine sehr verschiedene
Gr&ouml;&szlig;enordnung der Militanz. Das Beispiel Hitler als Beweis f&uuml;r
erfolgversprechende Rechtm&auml;&szlig;igkeit anzuf&uuml;hren ist falsch. Die Zeiten &auml;ndern
sich! So schlapp ist dieser Staat nun auch wieder nicht.<p>

Dieses Argument spricht allerdings auch gegen jene, die nun glauben, mit
Stahlhelm und Karabiner eine "revolution&auml;re Radikalkur" verordnen zu m&uuml;ssen.
In der Tat fehlen - abgesehen von der absonderlichen L&auml;cherlichkeit der
militaristischen Don Quichotes und Sancho Pansas - die wesentlichen
Voraussetzungen f&uuml;r einen bewaffneten revolution&auml;ren Kampf: Geographische
Vorteile wie z.B. in lateinamerikanischen L&auml;ndern, technisch quantitative
oder qualitative &Uuml;berlegenheit, Unterst&uuml;tzung der Volksmassen, &ouml;konomischer
Anla&szlig;, die Hilfe eines "gro&szlig;en Bruders", der auch nach dem erfolgten
Unternehmen eine Schutzfunktion &uuml;bernehmen k&ouml;nnte. Dennoch kann das beileibe
kein Grund sein, ab sofort die staatstragende Krawatte umzubinden und allen
Ernstes zu erkl&auml;ren, da&szlig; die Nationalen die besten aller denkbaren
Bundesrepublikaner seien. Eine rechte Wahlpartei hat das getan. Diese Methode
ist nicht nur taktisch zum Scheitern verurteilt, sondern sie hat auch eine
entscheidende Nebenwirkung, die doch gewi&szlig; nicht beabsichtigt sein kann: Sie
tr&auml;gt zur Stabilisierung eines teilnationalen Bewu&szlig;tseins bei, das den
gewollten Separatismus der Besatzungsdiener verh&auml;rtet und die Gr&auml;ben in
unserem Volk vertieft.<p>

Die Gesetzestreue ist im Grunde noch gef&auml;hrlicher f&uuml;r den europ&auml;ischen
Nationalismus als der Historismus. Diese beiden "Fl&uuml;gel" des Konservatismus
widersprechen sich aus prinzipiellen Gr&uuml;nden; denn wenn alles Bestehende als
rechtm&auml;&szlig;ig angesehen w&uuml;rde, k&ouml;nnte es Geschichte, also Entwicklung, gar
nicht geben. &Uuml;berhaupt d&uuml;rfte wohl nichts so schwer sein, als eine Definition
des politischen Begriffes "Konservatismus" zu wagen. Die r&uuml;ckw&auml;rtsgewandten
Tr&auml;umereien des Historismus jedenfalls, das lehrt z.B. die Geschichte der
Burschenschaften, k&ouml;nnen durchaus revolution&auml;re Impulse geben und die
bestehende Gesellschaft ver&auml;ndern; denn die Gegenwart an der Vergangenheit zu
messen, er&ouml;ffnet mitunter erstaunliche Perspektiven. Die Gesetzestreue aber
f&ouml;rdert die Zaghaftigkeit, beg&uuml;nstigt die Hasenf&uuml;&szlig;e, weil sie die jeweilige
staatliche Wirklichkeit als gegeben hinnimmt und ihre Basis als die ihre
betrachtet. Daraus folgen auch die "pragmatischen", "realistischen" und
"legalen" Einstellungen als Produkt der Logik. Der dynamische Nationalismus
der europ&auml;ischen Jugend besinnt sich jedoch auf die elementare Relativit&auml;t
staatlicher und rechtlicher Ordnungen und leitet daraus eine Politik
sch&ouml;pferischer Gestaltung ab, die eigene Normen setzt. Hier sp&auml;testens
erweist sich der "Neue Nationalismus" als revolution&auml;r.<p>

Zweifellos kann niemand behaupten, da&szlig; seine Theorie richtig sei und allein
zum Ziele f&uuml;hrt, ebensowenig kann das Gegenteil behauptet werden. Das
Schicksal einer Theorie, und damit meist auch das Schicksal eines Volkes,
vollendet sich erst in der Praxis. Die politische Tat leitet dabei die
Beweisf&uuml;hrung ein, w&auml;hrend die T&auml;ter und die Betroffenen dazu verdammt sind,
die weitere Entwicklung hinzunehmen. Dieser Gang der Dinge ist der Verlauf
der europ&auml;ischen Revolution. Sie beginnt im Geistigen, setzt sich fort in
aktivistischen Kadern und vollendet sich im Aufstand des Freiheitswillens der
V&ouml;lker gegen Unterdr&uuml;ckung und Ausbeutung durch die "Weltpolizisten". Aber
diese Reihenfolge mu&szlig; eingehalten werden, Schritt f&uuml;r Schritt. Ausdauer und
Rationalit&auml;t in der Planung, Einsatz des ganzen Herzens in der Durchf&uuml;hrung,
die Hinnahme von R&uuml;ckschl&auml;gen ohne Resignation und die besonnene Wertung von
Erfolgen werden die deutsche Sache und die der europ&auml;ischen Bruderv&ouml;lker
voranbringen. Eine solidarische Kooperation ist dabei unerl&auml;&szlig;lich.<p>

Alles ist eine Frage der Definition. Nationalisten w&uuml;rden z.B. gerne
konservativ - und hier liegt vielleicht wirklich der Schl&uuml;ssel zur
Gemeinsamkeit -, wenn Moeller van den Brucks Wort mehr Beachtung f&auml;nde:
"Konservativ ist, Di      chaffen, die zu erhalten sich lohnt." Diese
Formel k&ouml;nnte den Gegensatz zwischen der Arbeit mit den vorhandenen
M&ouml;glichkeiten und dem Willen zur Sch&ouml;pfung neuer Tatsachen einigerma&szlig;en
aufheben. Sie k&ouml;nnte den Widerspruch von Fortschritt und Bewahrung zumindest
vorl&auml;ufig aufl&ouml;sen. Doch der Definition folgt die Auslegung, und dabei haben
es die Marxisten aller Schattierungen bekanntlich zu einer wahren
Meisterschaft gebracht. Deshalb sollte sich der europ&auml;ische Nationalismus
fr&uuml;hzeitig davor h&uuml;ten, zwei- oder dreideutige Thesen aufzustellen, die
wieder Fehlauslegungen nach sich ziehen. Ein klares Wort, auch auf die Gefahr
von Schwierigkeiten, dient der Sache am besten. Das ist unsere Aufgabe, vor
der wir uns nicht dr&uuml;cken werden.<p>

<H1>Das Ende des Parteienzeitalters</H1>


Eine weitere unserer zentralen Thesen lautet, da&szlig; sich das Zeitalter der
politischen Parteien unwiderruflich seinem Ende zuneigt. Diese These mag
zun&auml;chst &uuml;berraschen, denn scheinbar haben die Parteien die Macht und damit
das Staatswesen BRD fester im Griff denn je. Nichts geht ohne Parteien, das
Parteibuch ist l&auml;ngst wichtiger geworden als nachgewiesene Sachkenntnis und
Kompetenz, wenn es um Spitzenpositionen in Staat und Gesellschaft geht. Kaum
eine gesellschaftliche Nische oder Struktur bleibt vom allgegenw&auml;rtigen
Parteienfilz verschont. &Uuml;berall, so hat man unwillk&uuml;rlich den Eindruck,
lauert der vielarmige Krake mit dem Namen "etablierte" oder "demokratische
Parteien". Ob es um die Farbgebung oder Gr&ouml;&szlig;e von M&uuml;lltonnen geht, ob man
umweltbewu&szlig;te B&uuml;rger mittels des ber&uuml;chtigten "Gr&uuml;nen Punktes" zum Narren
h&auml;lt, ob deutschen Mietern zugunsten parasit&auml;rer Asylanten die Wohnung
gek&uuml;ndigt wird oder ob Helmut K. und dessen "Spezi" Hans-Dietrich G. schon
mal dem m&ouml;rderischen US-Imperialismus 12 Milliarden Deutschmark "wg.
Golfkrieg" in den Rachen werfen, so scheint dies alles und noch viel mehr
ohne die Beteiligung "unserer" Parteien nicht abzugehen. Mit anderen Worten,
es gibt keine gesellschaftliche Entwicklung, keinen halbwegs relevanten
Proze&szlig;, bei dem die Parteien nicht in irgendeiner Weise mitwursteln und
nat&uuml;rlich mitkassieren. Fehlen hingegen die Parteien bzw deren Vertreter
irgendwann einmal, so deutet dies nur auf die v&ouml;llige Bedeutungslosigkeit
jenes Vorgangs hin, denn die Parteien, ihre Mitglieder und Funktionstr&auml;ger
sind das Schmier&ouml;l, sind die Zahnr&auml;der, die das am Laufen, am Funktionieren
halten, was wir so liebevoll unsere "FDGO" nennen.<p>


<H2>Die Parteien als Instrumente der Machterhaltung</H2>

Die leicht ironische Einf&uuml;hrung zu diesem Aufsatz machte bereits hinreichend
deutlich, was die Hauptfunktion der etablierten Parteien ist. Sie sind - ganz
im Gegensatz zu dem, was wir im Sozialkundeunterricht zu h&ouml;ren bekamen -
keineswegs dazu da, um Macht zu erobern, nein, ihre Aufgabe ist es allein,
die in den Parteien versammelten Bonzen und Funktion&auml;re an den Futtertr&ouml;gen
der Macht zu halten; das bedeutet nichts anderes, als da&szlig; das politische
System, das den aktuellen Inhabern von Macht, Geld und Einflu&szlig; eben dieses
erm&ouml;glichte, um <EM>jeden Preis erhalten</EM> werden mu&szlig;. Die Parteien erwiesen sich
nun im Lauf der Zeit als die idealen Transmissionsriemen der herrschenden
Klasse, um das gemeine Volk m&ouml;glichst widerspruchslos am G&auml;ngelband zu f&uuml;hren.<p>

Das war allerdings nicht immer so gewesen. Wie die Sinn Fein in Irland, die
Nationalpartei in S&uuml;dafrika und nat&uuml;rlich die NSDAP zeigten, gab es einmal
Zeiten, in denen es systemoppositionellen Parteien m&ouml;glich war, mittels
Abstimmungen oder Wahlen an die tats&auml;chliche Macht zu kommen. Damals war eben
das Parteiensystem noch nicht so verfestigt, waren die "etablierten Parteien"
noch nicht mit dem Staatswesen als solchem so gut wie identisch. Heute
freilich w&uuml;rde eine Abwahl der bezeichnenderweise als "staatstragend"
klassifizierten Parteien notwendig das Ende der politischen
Organisationsform Partei zur Folge haben.<p>

Ein Ersatz der "demokratischen" Parteien durch "nationale" Parteien
hierzulande ist genauso abwegig wie die Vorstellung westeurop&auml;ischer
Sozialdemokraten, der stalinistische Kommunismus werde durch eine Art von
"demokratischem" Kommunismus, dem sogenannten Sozialismus mit menschlichem
Antlitz ersetzt. Denkste! Die Menschen im ehemaligen Ostblock haben jede
Version von Sozialismus gr&uuml;ndlich satt. Genauso wie sich dort niemand unter
dem Begriff "Sozialismus" etwas Gutes vorstellen kann, wird man nach der
Revolution in unseren Breiten mit dem Wort "Partei" nicht die geringste
positive Assoziation verbinden.<p>

An dieser Stelle sei noch eine kleine Erl&auml;uterung gestattet. Es gibt aber
doch ausdr&uuml;cklich so etwas wie Oppositionsparteien, die, wie es doch ihr Name
schon ausdr&uuml;ckt, in Opposition zur Macht stehen, aber doch nicht die Macht
selbst aus&uuml;ben. So steht es im Sozialkundebuch der 9. Klasse, was Beweis
genug sein d&uuml;rfte, da&szlig; das pr&auml;zise Gegenteil der Wahrheit am n&auml;chsten kommt.
Jede unserer famosen Volksparteien plus ihren kleineren Mehrheitsbeschaffern
ist st&auml;ndig irgendwo an der Macht, w&auml;hrend sie anderenorts in Opposition
steht. Das ist und bleibt die beste und st&auml;ndig praktizierte Voraussetzung
daf&uuml;r, da&szlig; so ber&uuml;hmte Wahrheiten wie "eine Hand w&auml;scht die andere", "eine
Kr&auml;he hackt der anderen kein Auge aus", "die Gemeinsamkeit der Demokraten",
"Pack schl&auml;gt sich, Packt vertr&auml;gt sich" nie aus der Mode kommen. Es gibt
keine relevanten Oppositionsparteien in der BRD. Alle nennenswerten Parteien
sind automatisch Teil der herrschenden Klasse, Teilhaber an der realen
Machtaus&uuml;bung; dies gilt selbst dann, wenn man Parteien mit entgegengesetzten
Anspr&uuml;chen lancierte. Wie schnell die "Gr&uuml;nen" auf der Regierungsbank sa&szlig;en,
wei&szlig; wohl jeder, und da&szlig; die REP diesen Moment kaum erwarten k&ouml;nnen, ist
sicherlich keine b&ouml;swillige Unterstellung.<p>

Selbst die st&auml;ndig schikanierten, verfolgten, "extremistischen"
Kleinparteien sind objektiv St&uuml;tzen der staatlichen Macht, sogar dann, wenn
sie subjektiv glaubw&uuml;rdig solches heftig bestreiten. Von Spitzeln aller Art
verseucht, durch ihr verheerendes, <EM>ver&ouml;ffentlichtes</EM> Erscheinungsbild
magnetische Anziehungspunkte f&uuml;r Verr&uuml;ckte aller Rassen und Klassen, spielen
sie mehr oder weniger brav ihre Rolle als dunkelbraune Buhm&auml;nner der Nation,
von denen sich die "demokratischen Parteien" umso strahlender abheben.
Innerhalb der "Extremistenpartei" ist dabei eine Minderheit von psychisch
Normalgebliebenen weitgehend damit besch&auml;ftigt, den Sozialtherapeuten f&uuml;r
die gro&szlig;e Anzahl systemgesch&auml;digter, verhaltensgest&ouml;rter "Parteifreunde" zu
spielen. Bleibt, nachdem man die Fehlleistungen der Letztgenannten ausb&uuml;gelte,
noch etwas Freiraum, so "nutzt" man diesen zur pfleglichen Behandlung einer
unsinnig und &uuml;berdimensional aufgebl&auml;hten B&uuml;rokratie. Andererseits f&uuml;hrt die
st&auml;ndige Verbotsdrohung, die permanente Angst vor Kriminalisierung dazu, da&szlig;
hausgemachte Denksperren und Selbstzensuren die Analyse und konsequente
Therapie einmal erkannter Mi&szlig;st&auml;nde regelm&auml;&szlig;ig verhindern. Statt das System
selbst in Frage zu stellen, bleibt man h&auml;ufig bei querulatorisch anmutender
Besserwisserei ("das forderten wir schon in den sechziger Jahren; aber es
h&ouml;rt ja niemand auf uns ...") stehen. Fassen wir kurz zusammen, so k&ouml;nnen wir
festhalten: <EM>Jede</EM> Partei ist automatisch Teil der herrschenden Klasse oder
arbeitet dieser wenigstens indirekt zu. Diese Erkenntnis kann freilich nur
den &uuml;berraschen, der immer noch nicht kapiert hat, da&szlig; wir in einer
Parteiendemokratie leben und eine solche <EM>ohne</EM> Parteien ein Ding der
Unm&ouml;glichkeit w&auml;re.<p>

Wie funktioniert denn nun der Transmissionsriemen "politische Partei" genau?
Es gibt zwei Hauptfunktionen, die die Parteien der herrschenden Klasse so
lieb und teuer (letzteres im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes) machen. Einmal sind
sie harmlose Spielwiesen f&uuml;r politisch interessierte Zeitgenossen, die
alleingelassen vielleicht auf dumme Gedanken kommen w&uuml;rden. Zweitens dienen
sie dazu, den Proze&szlig; der Meinungsbildung von oben nach unten zu steuern, um
somit zu garantieren, da&szlig; eventuell aufkommende dumme Gedanken sich nicht
verbreiten k&ouml;nnen bzw schnell abgew&uuml;rgt werden.<p>


<H2>Die Partei als Besch&auml;ftigungstherapie f&uuml;r "Gschaftlhuber", Idealisten 
und Phantasten</H2>

Menschen, die in Parteien eintreten, haben die unterschiedlichsten Motive.
Neben materialistischen Erw&auml;gungen, die uns hier nicht interessieren, gibt
(inzwischen sollte es besser hei&szlig;en "gab", denn kein idealistisch veranlagter
Mensch, der noch halbwegs seine f&uuml;nf Sinne beieinander hat, wird heute
Mitglied einer Partei, wenn er etwas anderes als seinen Geldbeutel bewegen
will) es auch sympathischere Gr&uuml;nde, um sich in einer Partei zu organisieren:
Einer will erkannte Mi&szlig;st&auml;nde beseitigen, andere wollen dem erkl&auml;rten Feind
nicht kampflos das Feld &uuml;berlassen, der dritte h&auml;lt sich f&uuml;r kompetenter als
den Trottel, der ein Amt bekleidet, das nicht nur eine Nummer zu gro&szlig; f&uuml;r
ihn ist usw. Es ist also eine Mischung aus Idealismus, Interesse an den
&ouml;ffentlichen Dingen, rger &uuml;ber bestehende Verh&auml;ltnisse und amtierende
Personen, die fr&uuml;her einmal die bundesdeutschen Menschen scharenweise in die
Parteien trieb. Pr&auml;ziser formuliert, der seinerzeit vielbeschworene "m&uuml;ndige
B&uuml;rger" hatte ganz offensichtlich &uuml;bersch&uuml;ssige Energien, gute Nerven und eine
Menge Herz. Das alles wollte er nutzbringend, also parteilich organisiert,
anlegen. Um seinem zun&auml;chst idealistisch motivierten Ziel n&auml;herzukommen,
hatte das reformw&uuml;tige Neumitglied &uuml;ber Jahre hinweg gerackert, versucht, vom
Orts- und Kreisverband aufw&auml;rts, Mehrheiten zu bekommen, Denkschriften
verfa&szlig;t, Informationsabende durchgef&uuml;hrt, sich vielleicht ab und zu sogar
unters gemeine Volk gewagt. Diese Aktivit&auml;ten wurden so lange weitergef&uuml;hrt,
bis man entweder resignierend den R&uuml;ckzug ins Private antrat, oder aber durch
die &Uuml;bernahme lukrativer Posten in Partei oder Staat weggelobt und
korrumpiert die einst so lautstark vertretenen Ideale sehr in den Hintergrund
traten, um es noch freundlich auszudr&uuml;cken. An all dem gewinnt das politische
System der BRD. Politisch interessierte bzw engagierte Bundesb&uuml;rger k&ouml;nnen
sich auf diese Weise so lange austoben, bis sie resignieren und f&uuml;r den Rest
ihres Lebens von Politik und allem, was mit dieser zusammenh&auml;ngt, nichts mehr
wissen wollen.<p>

Die anderen freilich, denen die Erkenntnis, da&szlig; nur der, wer fr&uuml;h den Buckel
krumm macht, Parteikarriere macht, l&auml;ngst in Fleisch und Blut &uuml;bergegangen
war, wurden zu wichtigen, weil kritiklosen und jederzeit erpressbaren St&uuml;tzen
der unter der Abk&uuml;rzung FDGO bekannten Staats- und Gesellschaftsordnung der
BRD.<p>

Aber auch in anderer Weise dienen die etablierten, angeblich demokratischen
Parteien der Stabilisierung des real existierenden Herrschaftssystems des
besten aller deutschen Staaten. &Uuml;ber eine Heerschar sowohl haupt- als auch
ehrenamtlich t&auml;tiger Parteisoldaten kann in pr&auml;ziser Umkehrung der Theorie
dem gemeinen Volk die jeweilig aktuelle Politik der Parteispitzen "erl&auml;utert"
werden. Diese Erl&auml;uterung erfolgt &uuml;ber parteinahe Journalisten in allen
Massenmedien und Parteilobbyisten in den Verb&auml;nden oder den von &ouml;ffentlichen
Geldern abh&auml;ngigen Angestellten im &ouml;ffentlichen Dienst (z.B. Lehrer oder
Staatsanw&auml;lte) bis hinab zu Gemeinder&auml;ten oder den Parteienvertretern in noch
den kleinsten und unwichtigsten Vereinen vor Ort. Da all diese Personen in
irgendeiner Weise von den Parteien bzw dem von diesen l&auml;ngst zur Beute
erkl&auml;rten Staat abh&auml;ngig geworden sind oder zumindest abh&auml;ngig geworden zu
sein sich einbilden, werden sie stets versuchen, die W&uuml;nsche und Absichten
ihrer Br&ouml;tchengeber so genau wie m&ouml;glich zu erkennen und in die Realit&auml;t
umzusetzen. Willig reiht man sich so in Kampagnen gegen
"Ausl&auml;nderfeindlichkeit und Rassismus" oder f&uuml;r "die notwendige Ersetzung der
DM durch den ECU" ein, obwohl man unter vier Augen nicht genug gegen
Asylschwindler schimpfen kann oder Sinn und Zweck der DM-Zerschlagung heftig
bezweifelt wird. Statt aber Mut und Zivilcourage zu zeigen, mit der man
selbst heute noch durchkommen kann, entledigt man sich seiner W&uuml;rde als
Mensch und heult mit den W&ouml;lfen, um wenigstens ein paar Kr&uuml;mel aus dem Topf
"Selbstbedienungsladen BRD" abzubekommen. Die Herrschenden wiederum k&ouml;nnen
sich noch immer sicher sein, da&szlig; die Mehrheit ihnen gehorchen wird - murrend
zwar, aber doch ohne gr&ouml;&szlig;eres Gezeter. Aus &Uuml;berzeugungst&auml;tern werden so
Untertanen, die nicht aufgrund eigener Einsicht und unter Bewahrung der W&uuml;rde,
sondern aus Angst, Opportunismus und Korrumpierbarkeit so wie eben
beschrieben handeln. Was in Zeiten NOCH relativer gesellschaftlicher Ruhe die
Stabilit&auml;t des herrschenden Systems zu beweisen scheint, ist der sicherste
Hinweis darauf, da&szlig; das Politsystem  la BRD auch in dessen um die fr&uuml;here
Zone erweiterter Form bei einer l&auml;nger andauernden schweren Krise urpl&ouml;tzlich
wie ein Kartenhaus zusammenbrechen wird. Kein Mensch dieser Welt, nicht
einmal der deutsche Bananenb&uuml;rger, k&auml;mpft oder stirbt f&uuml;r etwas, das er nicht
in seinem Herzen tr&auml;gt. Nichts an dieser BRD wird staatstragend genug sein,
um diesen momentan vor sich hin wurstelnden Staat durch die kommenden heftig
bewegten Zeiten weitgehend unbesch&auml;digt durchzutragen. Beispielsweise
operiert die herrschende Klasse mit Geisterarmeen, wenn sie im Ernst glaubt,
sich im Notfall auf die Parteimitglieder verlassen zu k&ouml;nnen. Demselben
Irrtum unterlag bereits die SED-F&uuml;hrung, der mit beginnender Staatskrise die
Mitglieder in atemberaubender Geschwindigkeit davonliefen. Selbst f&uuml;r den
ziemlich unwahrscheinlichen Fall, da&szlig; keine grunds&auml;tzliche Systemver&auml;nderung
erfolgen wird, wird der nach der kommenden Krise existierende deutsche Staat
sehr wenig mit der heute real existierenden BRD zu tun haben. Weniger als
nichts bewirken und auf niemanden Eindruck machen werden dabei solch
l&auml;cherliche Staatsdemos, wie man sie im Herbst 1992 in Berlin durchf&uuml;hrte.
Schon die verblichene SED-Clique organisierte dergleichen befohlene
Kundgebungen selbst noch dann, als ihr Sturz schon begonnen hatte. Im
Gegenteil, solche Erscheinungen, da&szlig; n&auml;mlich die Regierung gegen angebliche
Mi&szlig;st&auml;nde nur noch protestieren kann, statt diese im Rahmen staatlichen
Handelns abzuschaffen, kann man nur noch als peinlichste Eingest&auml;ndnisse
eigener Ohnmacht einordnen. Da&szlig; in Berlin die Parteien bzw die obersten
Vertreter eben dieser Parteien vorneweg und f&uuml;r alle sichtbar mitlatschten,
ist mehr als alles andere der schlagende Beweis daf&uuml;r, da&szlig; die Parteien nur
mehr mit M&uuml;he die Macht zu erhalten suchen, von Eroberung oder
Neulegitimierung dieser Macht ganz zu schweigen.<p>


<H2>Von der Machteroberung zur Ohnmacht</H2>

Die bisher erfolgte Beschreibung des real existierenden Parteienunwesens in
der BRD, die, wie z.B. die Scheuch-Studie zeigt, keineswegs "eine geh&auml;ssige
Verleumdung seitens einiger unverbesserlicher Extremisten" ist, wie sich die
diesen Text "auswertenden" VS-Spitzel beruhigen k&ouml;nnten, macht wohl
hinreichend klar, da&szlig; die Parteien gegen Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts
sicherlich zu allem m&ouml;glichen, nur nicht zur Eroberung der politischen Macht
f&auml;hig sind. Wer aber nicht mehr zum Angriff in der Lage ist, wer immer
defensiver agiert und denkt, der steht nicht mehr an der Spitze der
historischen Entwicklung, sondern deckt den mehr oder weniger geordneten
R&uuml;ckzug aus derselben.<p>

Die politisch relevanten Prozesse der letzten ca. zwei Jahrzehnte verliefen
stets ohne, fast immer sogar gegen Parteiinteressen. So entstanden die
vielbeschworenen "neuen sozialen Bewegungen" (z.B. Umweltschutz- oder
Friedensbewegung) nach dem Tod oder Niedergang der in Parteiform
organisierten extremen Linken (K-Gruppen, DKP/SDAJ) und gegen den erkl&auml;rten
Willen der etablierten Parteien. Da&szlig; <EM>danach</EM> eigentlich fast wider Willen die
urspr&uuml;nglich als "Nichtpartei-Partei" geplante gr&uuml;ne Partei entstand, st&uuml;tzt
unsere These eindrucksvoll. Zun&auml;chst sind die Gr&uuml;nen ein Ergebnis, nicht der
Ausl&ouml;ser obiger Bewegungen, zudem wollten und mu&szlig;ten deren Wortf&uuml;hrer das im
Laufe der Zeit erworbene Terrain <EM>absichern</EM>, wobei einem trotz
entgegengesetzter Spr&uuml;che nur die Organisationsform Partei einfiel.
Entsprechende Denkblockaden kennt man schon seit langem im parteipolitisch
desorganisierten nationalen Lager.<p>

G&auml;nzlich ohne jede Form von Parteibildung verliefen die Demokratie- und
Nationalbewegungen im ehemaligen Ostblock. Die damals allein existierenden
Parteien, die eng mit dem Staatsapparat verfilzten KPs, waren sogar der
erkl&auml;rte Feind. <EM>Nachdem</EM> B&uuml;rger, Demokraten und Nationalisten die Kommunisten
verjagt, den Staatsapparat &uuml;bernommen hatten, begann man ernsthaft, neue
Parteien aufzubauen, um die soeben erworbene Macht zu konsolidieren, sie
gegen alte Kommunisten und neue revolution&auml;re Nationalisten sowie religi&ouml;se
Traditionalisten und Fundamentalisten zu <EM>verteidigen</EM>. Dabei ging der Aufbau
neuer Parteien keineswegs reibungslos vor sich, in keinem Punkt entsprach er
der Theorie der Sozial- und Gesellschaftskundeb&uuml;cher. Statt der
Konzentration auf einige feste, weltanschaulich oder klassenspezifisch
ausgerichtete Parteien, erfolgte eine geradezu abenteuerliche Zersplitterung
der neuen Parteien, die trotz weitgehender ideologischer und
programmatischer &Uuml;bereinstimmungen keine gemeinsame Organisierung dieser
gemeinsamen Interessen zulassen. Hinzu tritt eine enorme Mitgliederschw&auml;che
(Offensichtlich tritt man nur dann in eine Partei ein, wenn man als
Gegenleistung einen Posten zugesichert bekommt. Keiner tritt einer Partei
aus Idealismus bei oder um diese ostentativ zu unterst&uuml;tzen). Auch die gr&uuml;ne
Partei oder das B&uuml;ndnis '90 sind gerade in der ehemaligen Ostzone h&ouml;chst
mitgliederschwach. Das freilich bedeutet nichts anderes als: die Parteien
sind im Volk nicht verankert, sie geben keinerlei real existierende
Stimmungen wider, sie sind nur dazu da, um den in der Partei versammelten
Personen den praktischen Machterhalt zu erleichtern. Sobald eine "Partei"
diese Pr&auml;misse nicht erf&uuml;llt, gr&uuml;nden an den Rand gedr&auml;ngte Funktion&auml;re
flugs eine neue "Partei".<p>


<H2>Von der Parteien- zur Systemkrise</H2>

Noch einige andere Erscheinungen deuten das Ende des Parteienzeitalters an.
Das Ansehen der Parteien ist mittlerweile so schlecht geworden, da&szlig; nicht
nur "b&ouml;se Extremisten", sondern Hinz und Kunz Parallelen zu mafiaartigen
Strukturen ausmachen. Immer mehr anst&auml;ndige, honorige und seri&ouml;se Personen
verweigern sich der Mitgliedschaft. Selbiges gilt in fast noch st&auml;rkerem
Ma&szlig;e f&uuml;r die Jugend; in diesen Kreisen gilt ein Engagement in einer Partei
fast schon als kurios und skurril. F&uuml;r Posten, wo nichts oder wenig zu
verdienen ist (Vorstandsmitglied des Ortsverbandes oder Mitglied im
Kreistag), findet sich immer schwerer die n&ouml;tige Anzahl von qualifizierten
Leuten. Das erweist sich als eine weitere Parallele zu den Verh&auml;ltnissen im
"ersten antifaschistischen Staat auf deutschem Boden" gegen Ende der
siebziger Jahre. Seinerzeit begannen die Schwierigkeiten der SED, auch nur
nennenswert freiwillig engagierte Neumitglieder zu gewinnen. Allenthalben
gehen die Mitgliederzahlen der Parteien zur&uuml;ck, die Ausdehnung der
Westparteien auf die Zone kann getrost als gescheitert angesehen werden. In
der Zone geht es den Gro&szlig;parteien nicht anderes als den Gr&uuml;nen oder den
nationalen Parteien im Westen: es fehlt die organisierte Basis. Nach den
bezahlten Postenbesitzern kommt nicht mehr viel; es besteht ein krasses
Mi&szlig;verh&auml;ltnis zwischen der Zahl der W&auml;hler und der Mitglieder. CDU und
F.D.P. konnten zwar eine eindrucksvolle Anzahl von Mitgliedern ehemaliger
Blockfl&ouml;tenparteien &uuml;bernehmen - der SPD gelang nicht einmal dies
angesichts ihres Zusammengehens mit der KPD zur SED -, doch diese Leute sind
nicht an Parteiarbeit im eigentlichen Sinne interessiert, sondern betrachten
ihre Parteimitgliedschaft als Schutz vor politischer Verfolgung aufgrund
ihrer Aktivit&auml;ten in der ehemaligen DDR. Es mag deshalb kaum verwundern, da&szlig;
seitens der neuen Machthaber in den "neuen Bundesl&auml;ndern" immer wieder das
voreilig verh&auml;ngte Aufnahmeverbot f&uuml;r ehemalige SED-Mitglieder kritisiert
wird. Man hofft halt, da&szlig; aus einstmals strammen Genossinne und Genossen
genauso stramme, vor allem aber stromlinienf&ouml;rmige Parteiaktivisten werden.
W&auml;hrend einerseits die Glaubw&uuml;rdigkeit und das Ansehen der etablierten
Parteien rapide verfallen, entstehen &uuml;berall Protestparteien und Parteien,
die am rechten oder am links-anarchistischen Rand angesiedelt sind, beginnen,
ihr Sektendasein zu verlassen und zu relevanten politischen Gr&ouml;&szlig;en zu werden.
Die damit einhergehende, teilweise schon dramatisch zu nennende
Parteienzersplitterung, zu der noch ein scheinbar unaufhaltsamer R&uuml;ckgang
der Wahlbeteiligung tritt, f&uuml;hrt zu einer wachsenden Erosion der Macht.
Klare Entscheidungen, Probleml&ouml;sungen, die diesen Namen auch verdienen,
werden zu Rarit&auml;ten. Diese Defizite, die selbst bei prinzipiell Gutmeinenden
den Eindruck hinterlassen, die Parteien und ihre Repr&auml;sentanten seien nicht
nur unf&auml;hig, sondern eigentlich <EM>&uuml;berfl&uuml;ssig</EM>, treffen die als
"Parteiendemokratien" firmierenden Staaten der entwickelten Welt tief ins
Mark.<p>

L&auml;ngst werden nicht mehr nur Symptome und Ausw&uuml;chse kritisiert, schon h&ouml;rt
man allenthalben grunds&auml;tzliche Kritik. Die immer krasser erkennbaren
M&auml;ngel, die Furcht, das gegenw&auml;rtige System sei nicht krisenfest, wenn die
Krise heftiger und l&auml;nger ausfallen sollte, als es sich Kohl und Kinkel
jemals ertr&auml;umten, dies alles beginnt, sich in einer <EM>Systemkritik</EM> zu 
&auml;u&szlig;ern.
Man redet davon, den Parteien die Macht zu beschneiden, indem man diese
darauf hinweisen solle, die Parteien h&auml;tten nur die Aufgabe der "Mitwirkung"
am, nicht die der "Alleinbestimmung" des politischen Geschehens. Mit anderen
Worten, man wolle hier ein Ref&ouml;rmchen und da ein anderes in der stillen
Hoffnung, das System als solches weitgehend unver&auml;ndert lassen zu k&ouml;nnen.<p>

All diese Erscheinungen, von denen die Parteienkrise nur eine der
auff&auml;lligsten ist, lassen nur den einen Schlu&szlig; zu: die im Rahmen der
"westlichen Wertegemeinschaft" verfa&szlig;ten Staaten beginnen, mit ihrem Latein
immer mehr am Ende zu sein. Der eitle Wahn, End- und H&ouml;hepunkt der
gesellschaftlichen Entwicklung auf diesem Planeten zu sein, "das Ende der
Geschichte" erreicht zu haben, beginnt zu zerbr&ouml;seln. Wo in einem alten
System die Selbstzweifel zu spriesen beginnen, wo die real existierenden
Machtstrukturen sichtbare Risse zeigen, wo sich Regierung und "offizielle"
Opposition immer &auml;hnlicher werden, wo brennende Probleme nur mehr diskutiert
werden, weil niemand mehr gen&uuml;gend Macht und Mut besitzt, diese zu l&ouml;sen,
wo die Verteilungsk&auml;mpfe an Sch&auml;rfe zunehmen, wo man mittels Ref&ouml;rmchen
"Schlimmeres aufhalten" will, wo immer mehr Menschen Angst vor der Zukunft
bekommen, wo endlich immer mehr Menschen sich begr&uuml;ndet als Opfer von Unrecht
und Willk&uuml;r sehen, da werden die Keime f&uuml;r ein neues System gelegt, das kein
Abklatsch des alten sein wird, sondern &uuml;ber dieses hinauszeigend und es
&uuml;berwindend einen Blick in die Zukunft gestattet. Je st&auml;rker dabei die
Vertreter des alten Systems in Panik geraten, dabei immer mehr Fehler machen
und die Repressionsschraube anziehen, desto gewisser wird ihr Untergang sein.
Und wer jetzt versuchen sollte, durch Zwang und Terror den Gang der
Geschichte aufzuhalten, wird diese Illusion sp&auml;ter bitter und teuer zu
bezahlen haben.<p>


<H2>Von der Volksspaltung zum Kampf aller gegen alle</H2>

Aber es ist nicht nur die immer mehr entartende Form des
bundesrepublikanischen Parteiensystems, sondern es ist die Erscheinung
"Partei" als solche, die unsere Kritik und Ablehnung herausfordert. Die
Partei, auf deutsch der Teil, spaltet nicht nur ein Volk in verschiedene
Teile, die von winzigen Cliquen in quasi diktatorischer Anma&szlig;ung beherrscht
werden, sondern sie kann auch nur immer einen Teil der Wirklichkeit
widerspiegeln. Die beschr&auml;nkte Einsicht und Erkenntnis einer winzigen Gruppe
von Menschen, die das Ganze unter bewu&szlig;t subjektiven und egoistischen
Blickwinkeln (z.B. die Klassenpartei, die Interessenpartei, die
Regionalpartei, die ideologisch fixierte Partei usw.) betrachtet, ist
notwendig - selbst beim besten Willen in der Welt - dem Ganzen alles andere
als zutr&auml;glich. Parteienherrschaft bedeutet, da&szlig; man Teilinteressen h&ouml;her
ansetzt als das Ganze. Eine auf den Parteienkonsens sich st&uuml;tzende Regierung
meint lediglich, da&szlig; verschiedene Teilinteressen geb&uuml;ndelt werden in der
Absicht, bestimmten Gruppen des Volkes, gewissen Regionen oder Landschaften,
der einen oder anderen Stadt, Berufsgruppe oder &auml;hnlichem auf Kosten des
Ganzen Privilegien besonders effektiv zu erarbeiten.<p>

Parteien schlie&szlig;lich bedingen wegen der durch sie verursachten steigenden
Komplexit&auml;t politischer Prozesse die dieser Aufgabe gewachsenen Spezialisten,
die Berufspolitiker. W&auml;hrend fr&uuml;here Eliten in einem langen Reifeproze&szlig; sich
aus dem Ganzen, dem Volk herausentwickelten, repr&auml;sentieren die auf reine
Machtaus&uuml;bung und -vermittlung spezialisierten Berufspolitiker das gerade
Gegenteil. Die Parteipolitiker von heute sind dann erfolgreich, wenn sie
m&ouml;glichst geschickt und skrupellos die Interessen privilegierter Teile
(Lobbys) des Volkes auf Kosten der Gesamtheit vertreten. Das Ergebnis sind
Verteilungsk&auml;mpfe ohne Ende und voller Verbissenheit. Die gleichzeitige
Atomisierung der Gesellschaft, die Entsolidarisierung der Menschen endet da,
wo allein noch das Recht des Starken gilt. Zusammengefa&szlig;t bleibt
festzuhalten: die Parteienherrschaft f&uuml;hrt &uuml;ber die Volksspaltung letztlich
zur v&ouml;lligen Aufl&ouml;sung der Volksgemeinschaft und zum erbarmungslosen Kampf
aller gegen alle, zur sprichw&ouml;rtlichen H&ouml;lle auf Erden.<p>


<H2>Dienen statt verdienen - die Neue Elite</H2>

Im "Thesenentwurf Autorit&auml;t und Selbstbestimmung" der Organisation "Sache des
Volkes" (SdV) hei&szlig;t es unter anderem: "... jede Form der Herrschaft hat eine
Art der Auslese, der Elitebildung, der Entwicklung von Hierarchien notwendig
zur Folge ... Entscheidend ist die Frage, WIE diese Auslese erfolgt, wer wo
in der Hierarchie seinen Platz hat, wie man die Sehnsucht nach Autorit&auml;t und
Autonomie (Selbstbestimmung) unter einen Hut zu bringen vermag." Wenn es der
sich im verfallenden alten System heranbildenden Neuen Elite gelingt, sich
unter dem Leitspruch "Dem Volke und Deutschland dienen statt an diesen zu
verdienen" sammelnd diesen hohen Anspruch bereits im allt&auml;glichen
Mikrokosmos zu leben, dann wird nicht nur das Parteienzeitalter &uuml;berwunden,
sondern auch die auf reinstem, primitivstem Materialismus basierende
"westliche Wertegemeinschaft". Wie dieser revolution&auml;re Weg, der auch nach
altem indogermanischem Gesetz "der Weg des Kriegers oder des Weisen" genannt
wird, aussehen k&ouml;nnte, das wurde in fr&uuml;heren Ausgaben bereits diskutiert
(vgl. u.a. den Beitrag <a href="german/zonen.htm" >Schafft befreite Zonen!</a>) 
und wird hier nicht weiter ausgef&uuml;hrt.<p>

<H1>Wie organisieren?</H1>

Wir haben in der vorhergehenden Ausgabe dieser Zeitschrift vom 
<a href="german/endzeit.htm" >Ende des Parteienzeitalters</a> geschrieben. 
Das seinerzeit geschriebene wird
gerade eindrucksvoll bewiesen durch die Schwierigkeit der Parteien
Kandidaten f&uuml;r ihre Listen zu den Brandenburger Kommunalwahlen zu
finden. In dieser Ausgabe sollen nun &Uuml;berlegungen zu alternativen
Organisationsformen angestellt werden. Diese sind umso dringlicher,
als es heute - anders als dies vor zehn oder zwanzig Jahren der Fall
gewesen w&auml;re - nicht mehr ausreicht, eine Rep-Partei, DVU, NPD/JN usw.
ohne Asoziale aufzumachen. Auch eine Kader-Partei, so n&uuml;tzlich sie
fr&uuml;her auch gewesen w&auml;re, ist heute absolut fehl am Platz. Es geht
hierbei nicht in erster Linie um die reale Verbotsgefahr, die in
diesen hysterischen Zeiten alle Aufbauarbeit &uuml;ber Nacht zunichte
machen kann; auch ohne dieses Damoklesschwert w&auml;ren mit diesen
Konzepten nur sehr begrenzte Erfolge zu erzielen einfach weil die Zeit
f&uuml;r Parteien vorbei ist.<p>

Wenn wir von Parteien  sprechen, dann meinen wir damit in erster
Linie das "Prinzip Partei". Man kann n&auml;mlich durchaus Mitglied, oder
noch Mitglied einer Partei sein, ohne deshalb zum Parteimenschen zu
werden. Wenn ihr also meint, einen Grund zu haben, noch in der einen
oder anderen Partei mitzuarbeiten, dann sollte ein erster Schritt hin
zu einer Nachpartei-&Auml;ra ein konsequenter R&uuml;ckzug aus allen
Parteih&auml;ndeln, sowohl innerhalb der eigenen Partei, als auch innerhalb
des Lagers, sein. F&uuml;r diejenigen, die schon l&auml;nger im Kampf stehen,
ist es keine neue Erkenntnis, da&szlig; alle Optionen innerhalb dieses
Grabenkampfes per Saldo, unter Hinweglassung pers&ouml;nlicher Loyalit&auml;ten
und Vorlieben, auf dasselbe herauskommen. Einfach deswegen, weil sich
in allen Parteien (und allen Fraktionen derselbigen) des nationalen
Lagers dieselben Konstellationen finden. Mit unterschiedlicher
Gewichtung, gewi&szlig;, aber nichtsdestotrotz dieselben! Unsere Gruppe, die
der revolution&auml;ren Nationalisten, ist in allen Fraktionen und Parteien
in einer hoffnungslosen Minderheit. Das hei&szlig;t, da&szlig; wer auch immer
gewinnt, wir - im Falle unserer Mitwirkung - zu den Verlierern, oder
besser ausgedr&uuml;ckt, zu den n&uuml;tzlichen Idioten geh&ouml;ren w&uuml;rden. Dies
ist aber nicht weiter tragisch, da, wie bereits in der vierten Ausgabe
dieser Zeitschrift ausreichend begr&uuml;ndet, die Befreiung eben nicht
&uuml;ber einen 50,01-Prozent-Sieg irgendeiner nationalen Partei vonstatten
gehen wird. Ebenso notgedrungen wie wir heute zu den Verlierern
partei- oder lagerinterner Auseinandersetzungen geh&ouml;ren m&uuml;ssen, werden
die nationalen Parteien, sofern sie nicht von einem gn&auml;digen Schicksal
vorher verboten werden, zu den Verlierern der Revolution geh&ouml;ren.<p>


<H2>Kein notwendiges &Uuml;bel</H2>

Es ist auch keineswegs so, da&szlig; man Parteien braucht, da&szlig; sie ein
notwendiges &Uuml;bel unseres Kampfes darstellen. Nur f&uuml;r die Teilnahme an
&uuml;berregionalen Wahlen sind sie, aus gesetzlichen Gr&uuml;nden,
unentbehrlich. F&uuml;r alles andere aber sind sie nur hinderlich. Nehmen
wir nur als ein Beispiel das Erstellen eines Flugblattes zu einem
aktuellen  Thema her. Wer derartiges schon einmal versucht hat im
Rahmen einer   Partei durchzuziehen, wei&szlig; wovon ich rede:  Ganze
Kompanien von Partei"freunden" wollen, liegt der Entwurf erst einmal
vor, bei Gestaltung und Inhalt mitreden. - Geht es aber, nachdem man
sich endlich auf eine f&uuml;r alle tragbare Form geeinigt hat, an das
Zahlen der Druckkosten und an das Verteilen, sind die eifrigen
Besserwisser pl&ouml;tzlich wieder verschwunden. H&auml;tte man also dasselbe
Flugblatt parteiunabh&auml;ngig gemacht und vertrieben, dann h&auml;tte man sich
bei weniger Arbeit (keine dauernden Ab&auml;nderungen) und gleichen Kosten
auch noch die Nerven geschont.<p>

Ganz offensichtlich ist es so, da&szlig; die Etablierung einer seri&ouml;sen
nationalen Wahlpartei systemstabilisierend wirkt und den von uns
allen ersehnten Zusammenbruch desselben um Jahre verz&ouml;gern wird. W&auml;re
die herrschende Klasse nicht so ohne alle Ma&szlig;en verbohrt und paranoid,
so w&uuml;rde sie die Etablierung einer derartigen Partei geradezu f&ouml;rdern,
um sie und in Zusammenarbeit mit ihr die unzufriedenen Teile der
Bev&ouml;lkerung wieder in das System einzugliedern. Ebenso offensichtlich
ist es aber, da&szlig; eine derartige Partei absolut unvermeidlich sein
wird. Dies liegt einmal daran, da&szlig; es in weiten Kreisen der
Bev&ouml;lkerung, die ja trotz aller Unzufriede      1ch lange nicht die
Herrschaftsmechanismen des Systems durchschaut hat, den Wunsch nach
einer solchen Partei und die Bereitschaft eine solche zu w&auml;hlen gibt.
Andererseits werden sich immer irgendwelche Hanseln finden, die bereit
sind, mit einer nationalen Partei an Wahlen teilzunehmen und dann,
wenn die Stimmung im Volk entsprechend ist und sie sich nicht allzu
bl&ouml;d anstellen, auch gew&auml;hlt werden. Auf diese Weise kann der
unzufriedene Landsmann seine Wut auf die Altparteien mittels
Protestw&auml;hlen abreagieren und der Staat potentielle revolution&auml;re
Aktivisten &uuml;ber die Parteim&uuml;hle oder die parlamentarische Sacharbeit
neutralisieren. Da dies aber, wie wir festgestellt haben, eben
unvermeidlich ist, w&auml;re es nutzlos, ja kontraproduktiv, Energie f&uuml;r
die Bek&auml;mpfung einer derartigen Entwicklung zu verschwenden. Seien wir
also pragmatisch und verbuchen das ganze unter "notwendige Verluste".<p>

<H2>Neue Einheit an der Basis</H2>

Um siegen zu k&ouml;nnen brauchen wir nichts dringlicher als
Mitstreiter. Zwar alles andere als Millionenheere, aber doch deutlich
mehr als wir heute haben. Da die Zeit dr&auml;ngt und unsere Ressourcen
&auml;u&szlig;erst knapp bemessen sind, ist ein auf Effizienz ausgerichtetes
Vorgehen auch auf diesem Feld unabdingbare Voraussetzung f&uuml;r den
Erfolg. Da man ungef&auml;hr, je nach Gruppierung, ein Zehntel bis ein
F&uuml;nftel der organisierten Nationalen (vom Jungkonservativen bis zum
"Neo-Nazi") als "gute Leute" (nicht bl&ouml;d, nicht asozial, lernf&auml;hig,
keine Querulanten) bezeichnen kann, und da mit sich stetig
verst&auml;rkender Tendenz eine beachtliche Anzahl von Jugendlichen die
Pr&auml;missen des Systems verwirft, aus eigenem Antrieb zu uns st&ouml;&szlig;t und
hierbei infolge Eigenstudium mehr Wissen mitbringt als dies die
Parteien neben ihren immerw&auml;hrenden Wahik&auml;mpfen je zu vermitteln in
der Lage sind, w&auml;re es geradezu kriminell wenn wir uns bei der
Rekrutierung auf die Neuanwerbung konzentrieren w&uuml;rden. Ein erster
ganz entscheidender Schritt bei der Organisierung der brauchbaren
Leute ist also deren Herausl&ouml;sung aus den Grabenk&auml;mpfen und eine
Ann&auml;herung &uuml;ber die bisherigen Trennlinien hinweg. Der erste Schritt
hierzu ist, da&szlig; sich jeder selbst vom Parteiprinzip l&ouml;st und die
anderen Gruppierungen im Lager nicht als Konkurrenten um
Abgeordnetenmandate sieht, die f&uuml;r die meisten ohnehin nicht
erreichbar sind, sondern als Mitstreiter f&uuml;r ein gemeinsames oder doch
&auml;hnliches Ziel. Tragt also daf&uuml;r Sorge, da&szlig; ihr an Eurem Wohnort das
Lager kennt und sorgt daf&uuml;r oder helft mit, da&szlig; die guten Leute in
diesem &uuml;berschaubaren Rahmen auch au&szlig;erhaib ihrer Stammorganisationen
zusammenkommen. Alle Erfahrung zeigt, da&szlig; sich, ist dies ersteinmal
erreicht, sehr schnell neue Perspektiven auftun und Projekte
realisierbar werden, an die vorher nicht zu denken war. Wenn man erst
einmal damit aufh&ouml;rt, den anderen immer zuallererst den eigenen
Fraktionsf&uuml;hrer und die eigene Sekte ans Herz zu legen, dann wird man
sehr schnell feststellen, da&szlig; die Gemeinsamkeiten nicht nur
&uuml;berwiegen, sondern da&szlig; es kaum Trennendes gibt. Aus diesem Grund
geben wir auch schon seit l&auml;ngerern nur noch Wertungen &uuml;ber politische
Inhalte und Strategien, nicht aber &uuml;ber Personen und Organisationen
ab. Wir lassen uns hierzu auch nicht durch j&uuml;ngst erfolgte
Wadenbei&szlig;ereien provozieren. Es geht nicht darum, da&szlig; wir als
Einzelpersonen oder als Organisation siegen, sondern darum, was wir
als solche zum Sieg beitragen.<p>


<H2>Warum organisierern?</H2>

Wieso aber, so k&ouml;nnte der eine oder andere versucht sein zu fragen,
brauchen wir dann &uuml;berhaupt eine Organisation? Wir brauchen diese
nat&uuml;rlich nicht, um DM 10,- an Monatsbeitrag zu kassieren oder damit
jemand den Vorsitzenden machen kann! Der Sinn von Organisierung kann
unseres Erachtens nur in nachfolgend aufgef&uuml;hrten Punkten liegen:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Erm&ouml;glichung einer <EM>&uuml;berregionalen</EM> Kommunikation.
<LI>Eine Verbindung <EM>gleichgesinnter</EM> Initiativen, Projekte und Menschen,
mit dem Zweck, sich gegenseitig zu helfen und zu ermutigen.
<LI><EM>Aussenstehenden</EM> Gleichgesinnten den Kontakt erm&ouml;glichen.
<LI><EM>Durchf&uuml;hrung von Projekten</EM> erm&ouml;glichen, zu denen man als
Einzelk&auml;mpfer oder als Sektenh&auml;uptling niemals in der Lage w&auml;re.
<LI>Sie soll die Isolation der Aktivisten &uuml;berwinden helfen und das
Gef&uuml;hl vermitteln <EM>nicht allein zu sein</EM>.
</UL>

Hierzu eine Anmerkung zu den Unorganisierten: Wenn niemand wei&szlig; was
ich denke, und ich niemanden kenne, der so denkt wie ich, dann kann
ich mich auf den Kopf stellen und werde trotzdem nichts bewirken und
baldigst resignieren. Ich werde also dem Feind das Feld &uuml;berlassen.
Eine - wenn auch noch so lockere - Form der Organisation ist also
unabdingbar. Es geht um das <EM>Prinzip Verschw&ouml;rung</EM>: Alles, was die
unterschiedlichen Freimaurerlogen seit ihren Anf&auml;ngen an Zersetzungs-
und Zerst&ouml;rungsarbeit bewirkt haben, w&auml;re theoretisch auch ohne sie,
als Folge von Einzelinitiativen, m&ouml;glich gewesen. Aller
Wahrscheinlichkeit nach h&auml;tten diese Einzelinitiativen aber nur
Bruchteile des jetzigen "Erfolges" gezeitigt.<p>

Die bisherige Organisierung in Parteien und deren klassische
Gliederung in Landes-, Bezirks-, Kreis- und Ortsverb&auml;nde hat als
entscheidenden Mangel, der sich nat&uuml;rlich aufgrund unserer kleinen
Zahl noch potenziert, da&szlig; hierbei Menschen mit unterschiedlichen
Interessenschwerpunkten nach dem Territorialprinzip organisiert
werden. Das Ergebnis ist, da&szlig; sie sich ihrem eigenen selbstgesteckten
Aufgabenfeld nur noch am Rande widmen k&ouml;nnen und ihre Hauptenergie in
Dinge investieren m&uuml;ssen, die sie nur beil&auml;ufig oder aber &uuml;berhaupt
nicht interessieren. Hierbei gibt es nat&uuml;rlich auch Proviteure,
n&auml;mlich diejenigen, f&uuml;r die die Partei das Hauptinteresse darstellt;
f&uuml;r die anderen aber ist dies eine h&auml;ufige Quelle der Resignation,
oder auch ein Grund es von vornherein bleiben zu lassen. Jemand, der
zum Beispiel f&uuml;r die Wiederherstellung der Selbst&auml;ndigkeit seines im
Zuge der Gebietsreform zwangseingemeindeten Heimat- bzw. Wohnortes
oder f&uuml;r ein Bundesland Franken k&auml;mpft, sich an der herausgabe einer
nicht parteigebundenen Zeitung beteiligt, in der Jugendarbeit
engagiert ist oder irgendetwas  macht, was  nicht mit dem  Hauptzweck
der Partei deckungsgleich ist, wird laufend mit dieser in Konflikt
geraten, weil er nach deren Meinung woanders, wo sie es f&uuml;r
dringlicher h&auml;lt (z.B. wichtiger und alles entscheidender Wahlkampf
wei&szlig; der Teufel wo, oder Schriftf&uuml;hrer im Kreisvorstand), notgedrungen
fehlen wird. Einzig und allein auf lokaler oder regionaler Ebene ist
ein regelm&auml;&szlig;iger interessen- und schwerpunkt&uuml;bergreifender Kontakt
sinnvoll; allerdings nur dann, wenn er m&ouml;glichst informell, ohne
B&uuml;rokratie bleibt.<p>

Anstelle der bisherigen zentralverwalteten Territorialgliederungen
m&uuml;ssen autonome, auf gemeinsamen Interessenschwerpunkten beruhende
Projekte und Frontorganisationentreten. Diese k&ouml;nnen von dauerhafter,
aber auch von vor&uuml;bergehender Natur sein. Ein Beispiel f&uuml;r letzteres
ist der j&auml;hrliche Rudolf-Hess-Gedenkmarsch. Hierf&uuml;r gibt es ganz gewi&szlig;
ein das ganze nationale Lager umfassendes Interesse. Es besteht
deshalb aber noch lange kein Interesse mit denselben Leuten, mit denen
man in Wunsiedel oder Fulda demonstrierte, das ganze Jahr &uuml;ber
zusammenzuh&auml;ngen. In der Regel wird aber selbstredend eine
dauerhaftere Natur von N&ouml;ten sein. Zu beackernde Felder gibt es genug:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Mitarbeit bei bestehenden, oder auch Neuinszenierung von
Medienprojekten (Illustrierte, Magazin, Stadtzeitung, &uuml;berregionale
Zeitung, Graphikstudio, Verlag, Videoproduktion und dergleichen mehr).

<LI>Regionalistische Frontorganisationen zur Ausnutzung bestehender
Ungerechtigkeiten in der L&auml;ndereinteilung, um auf diese Weise unsere
&uuml;brigen Positionen besser an den Mann zu bringen. Gleichzeitig kann
man hierbei von den Erfolgen &auml;hnlicher Bestrebungen in Italien
profitieren. So wie sich die Gr&uuml;nen von Deutschland &uuml;ber ganz Europa
ausgebreitet haben, so wird die regionalistische Bewegung in Italien
sicherlich nicht ohne Folgen in hierf&uuml;r anf&auml;lligen Regionen in anderen
europ&auml;ischen L&auml;ndern bleiben. Es kommt auch hier, wie damals schon
beim Umweltschutz darauf an, wer die Begriffe rechtzeitig besetzt.

<LI>Ostdeutschland war immer ein zentrales Thema der Nationalen. Heute
stellt Ostpreu&szlig;en ein herrenloses St&uuml;ck Land mitten in Europa dar, das
nur darauf wartet wieder erobert zu werden. Gerade weil die BRD es
nicht will, stehen uns alle Optionen offen. Der erwartete Zuzug von
Hunderttausenden von Ru&szlig;landdeutschen nach Nord-Ostpreu&szlig;en, der eben
auch wieder gerade deswegen unvermeidlich ist, weil die BRD sie bei
uns hier nicht als Konkurrenz zu den Einwanderern aus der Dritten Welt
haben will, wird uns eine f&uuml;r unsere Ideen mehr als offene Bev&ouml;lkerung
bescheren. Auch in Oberschlesien mit seiner starken deutschen
Restbev&ouml;lkerung tun sich, wenn auch nicht im selben Ausma&szlig;,
interessante Perspektiven auf.

<LI>Wirtschaftliche Projekte, die es den f&uuml;hrenden Aktivisten erlauben,
sich aus dem System und seinen Zw&auml;ngen auszuklinken. Leider haben die
Nationalen in der Vergangenheit oft Mentalit&auml;t von
Sozialhilfeempf&auml;ngern und Beamten gepflegt. Sicherlich war dies eine
der Quellen ihrer Mi&szlig;erfolge. So sehr auch manche &uuml;ber wirtschaftliche
Fragen die Nase r&uuml;mpften, so wurden sie doch fr&uuml;her oder sp&auml;ter von
den Sachzw&auml;ngen eingeholt. W&auml;hrend der Feind zu einschneidenden
Sanktionen und Vernichtungsschl&auml;gen in der Lage ist, reicht es bei uns
in der Regel noch nicht einmal zu einfachsten Schutzma&szlig;nahmen. Gewi&szlig;
wird man in diesem Bereich anfangs oft kleine Br&ouml;tchen backen m&uuml;ssen,
doch ist auch eine Teilabsicherung besser als gar keine.
</UL>

<H2>H&uuml;tet Euch vor Mitgliedern!</H2>

Der schlimmste Feind des Aktivisten ist das Mitglied, das gleiche
Rechte beansprucht bzw. dem gleiche Rechte zugestanden werden, das
aber nicht daran denkt, auch die gleichen Pflichten auf sich zu
nehmen. Alles besserwissend und nichts bessermachend, eine
unersch&ouml;pfliche Quelle von Intrigen, eher auf Geselligkeit im Kreise
Gleichgesinnter als auf Kampf aus, stellt es ein &Auml;rgernis vom Tag
seiner Aufnahme an dar, an dem ihm schon meist der Aufnahmeantrag
ausgef&uuml;llt werden mu&szlig;, bis zum Austritt aus nichtigem Grund unter
Hinterlassung von Beitragsschulden. Ersetzen wir deshalb das Mitglied
durch den F&ouml;rderer. Wenn jemand bei uns anklopft, sagen wir ihm gleich
von Anfang an, was wir von einem Aktivisten erwarten und bieten denen,
die dies nicht leisten k&ouml;nnen oder wollen den Status des F&ouml;rderers an.<p>

<H2>Verh&auml;ltnis zu den Medien</H2>

Die Systemmedien sind nicht etwa neutrale Beobachter, denen man nur
ihre gegen uns gehegten Vorurteile nehmen mu&szlig;, sondern ebenso
integraler Teil des Herrschaftsapparates wie z.B. der
Verfassungsschutz. Die Basis f&uuml;r eine Zusammenarbeit mit ihnen ist
deshalb einfach nicht vorhanden! Daran &auml;ndert auch der Umstand nichts,
da&szlig; es in den Systemmedien Anh&auml;nger von uns gibt. Diese sind dort aber
abh&auml;ngig besch&auml;ftigt und ihre Zahl ist so gering, da&szlig; es allenfalls
f&uuml;r die eine oder andere "kleine Meldung" reicht, die aber das Kraut
auch nicht fett macht. Jedenfalls sind diese Sympathisanten und die
"kleinen Meldungen" es nicht wert, da&szlig; wir Zeit und Geld f&uuml;r den
zentnerweisen Versand von Presseerkl&auml;rungen verschwenden. Gr&ouml;&szlig;ere
Berichte, also solche die auch von einer relevanten Anzahl von
Menschen wahrgenommen werden, werden sowieso negativ sein. Derartige
L&uuml;gengeschichten kann sich aber der Herr Journalist auch gleich
komplett aus den Fingern saugen. Durch unsere Mitarbeit
(Presseerkl&auml;rungen und Pressekonferenzen, Interviews, oder wenn wir
wie die Auerh&auml;hne f&uuml;r "antifaschistische" Fahndungsfotos posieren)
verhelfen wir ihm nur zu dem K&ouml;rnchen Wahrheit, das seine L&uuml;gen erst
glaubw&uuml;rdig macht.<p>

Ninguna. La &uacute;nica evidencia la constituye el testimonio de &quot;sobrevivientes&quot; individuales. Este testimonio es contradictorio y ning&uacute;n &quot;sobreviviente&quot; alega haber presenciado de hecho ning&uacute;n &quot;gaseo&quot;. No hay pruebas concretas de ning&uacute;n tipo: no hay enormes cantidades de cenizas; no hay instalaciones crematorias capaces de realizar la operaci&oacute;n; no hay pilas de ropa; no hay jab&oacute;n hecho a partir de seres humanos; no hay pantallas para l&aacute;mparas hechas con piel humana; no hay archivos; no hay estad&iacute;sticas demogr&aacute;ficas.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; pruebas existen en cuanto a que no murieron seis millones de jud&iacute;os a manos de los nazis?</B><BR>
Muchas; incluyendo las de naturaleza forense, demogr&aacute;fica, anal&iacute;tica y comparativa -todas concurriendo a probar la imposibilidad de esa cifra que representa una exageraci&oacute;n irresponsable de, quiz&aacute;s, un 1000%.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Es cierto que Sim&oacute;n Wiesenthal afirm&oacute;, por escrito, que &quot;no hubo campos de exterminio en suelo alem&aacute;n&quot;?</B><BR>
S&iacute;. En &quot;Books &amp; Bookmen&quot; -ejemplar de abril de 1975- y en &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes -ejemplar de enero de 1993-, Wiesenthal alega que el &quot;gaseo&quot; de jud&iacute;os tuvo lugar en Polonia.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Si Dachau quedaba en Alemania y hasta Simon Wiesenthal dice que no fue un campo de exterminio, entonces &#191;por qu&eacute; miles de veteranos de guerra en los Estados Unidos dicen que lo fue?</B><BR>
Porque despu&eacute;s de que los aliados capturaron Dachau, miles de conscriptos norteamericanos fueron llevados y paseados por Dachau en donde se les mostraron edificios de los que se dijo eran c&aacute;maras de gas y porque los medios masivos de difusi&oacute;n, amplia pero falsamente, afirmaron que Dachau era un campo de &quot;gaseo&quot;.<p>
<B><li>Auschwitz queda en Polonia, no en Alemania. &#191;Hay alguna prueba de que existiesen c&aacute;maras de gas construidas para dar muerte a seres humanos en, o cerca de, Auschwitz?</B><BR>
No. Se ofreci&oacute; una recompensa de 50,000 d&oacute;lares a quien aportase tal prueba, y el dinero fue depositado en un banco, pero no apareci&oacute; nadie con prueba cre&iacute;ble alguna. Auschwitz, capturado por los sovi&eacute;ticos, fue ampliamente remodelado despu&eacute;s de la guerra y se reconstruyeron distintos edificios para que pareciesen enormes c&aacute;maras de gas. Actualmente, Auschwitz es una gran atracci&oacute;n tur&iacute;stica para el gobierno comunista polaco.<p>
<B><li>Si Auschwitz no fue un &quot;campo de exterminio&quot;, &#191;cu&aacute;l fue su verdadera finalidad?</B><BR>
Fue un complejo industrial a gran escala. Tuvo f&aacute;bricas de caucho y combustible sint&eacute;tico (&quot;Buna&quot;) y los reclusos, fueron utilizados como mano de obra. El procedimiento para la obtenci&oacute;n del &quot;Buna&quot; tambi&eacute;n fue empleado en los EE.UU. durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qui&eacute;n cre&oacute; los primeros campos de concentraci&oacute;n?. &#191;D&oacute;nde y cu&aacute;ndo fueron empleados por primera vez?</B><BR>
Aparentemente, los primeros campos de concentraci&oacute;n en el mundo occidental surgieron en los EE.UU. durante la Guerra de Independencia norteamericana. Los brit&aacute;nicos internaron a miles de norteamericanos, muchos de los cuales murieron a causa de enfermedades y golpizas. A modo de ejemplo puede citarse a Andrew Jackson y a su hermano, este &uacute;ltimo falleci&oacute; en uno de esos campos. M&aacute;s tarde, los brit&aacute;nicos erigieron campos de concentraci&oacute;n en Africa del Sur para internar a mujeres y ni&ntilde;os holandeses durante la conquista de ese territorio (la Guerra Boer). Decenas de miles de estas personas murieron en los infernales campos sudafricanos, cuyas condiciones de internaci&oacute;n fueron, de lejos, mucho peores que las de cualquier campo de concentraci&oacute;n alem&aacute;n durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial.<p>
<B><li>&#191;En qu&eacute; se diferenciaron los campos de concentraci&oacute;n alemanes de los campos de reubicaci&oacute;n norteamericanos en los que se internaron a japoneses y a alemanes residentes en los EE.UU. durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial?</B><BR>
Excepto por la denominaci&oacute;n, la &uacute;nica diferencia significativa consisti&oacute; en que los alemanes internaron a personas que constitu&iacute;an, real o supuestamente, una amenaza para la seguridad del esfuerzo b&eacute;lico alem&aacute;n, mientras que los norteamericanos internaron a personas exclusivamente a causa de su condici&oacute;n racial.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Por qu&eacute; los alemanes internaron a los jud&iacute;os en campos de concentraci&oacute;n?</B><BR>
Porque consideraron que los jud&iacute;os constitu&iacute;an una amenaza directa a la soberan&iacute;a y a la supervivencia de la Naci&oacute;n alemana y porque los jud&iacute;os aparec&iacute;an con desproporcionada frecuencia en las organizaciones subversivas comunistas. Sin embargo, no s&oacute;lo los jud&iacute;os sino todos los sospechosos de socavar la seguridad nacional estuvieron expuestos o fueron internados.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; acci&oacute;n a gran escala emprendi&oacute; el juda&iacute;smo internacional contra Alemania ya en 1933?</B><BR>
Un boicot econ&oacute;mico internacional contra los productos alemanes.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Es cierto que el juda&iacute;smo internacional le &quot;declar&oacute; la guerra&quot; a Alemania?</B><BR>
S&iacute;. Los medios masivos de difusi&oacute;n del mundo entero aparecieron con titulares que dec&iacute;an: &quot;Judea declara la guerra a Alemania&quot;.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Sucedi&oacute; esto antes o despu&eacute;s de que comenzasen a circular rumores acerca de los &quot;campos de exterminio&quot;?</B><BR>
Sucedi&oacute; casi seis a&ntilde;os antes. El juda&iacute;smo le declar&oacute; la guerra a Alemania en 1933.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Cu&aacute;l fue el primer pa&iacute;s en llevar a cabo bombardeos masivos a la poblaci&oacute;n civil?</B><BR>
Inglaterra; el 11 de mayo de 1940.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Cu&aacute;ntas c&aacute;maras de gas, para exterminar personas, hubo en Auschwitz?</B><BR>
Ninguna.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Cu&aacute;ntos jud&iacute;os hab&iacute;a, antes de la guerra, en los territorios que posteriormente pasaron a ser controlados por los alemanes?</B><BR>
Menos de cuatro millones.<p>
<B><li>Si los jud&iacute;os europeos no fueron exterminados por los nazis, &#191;qu&eacute; pas&oacute; con ellos?</B><BR>
Despu&eacute;s de la guerra, los jud&iacute;os europeos segu&iacute;an estando en Europa, con excepci&oacute;n de, quiz&aacute;s, unos 300,000 de ellos entre los cuales est&aacute;n quienes efectivamente murieron por una multiplicidad de causas durante el conflicto, y los que consiguieron emigrar a Israel, los EE.UU., la Argentina, Canad&aacute;, etc.. La mayor&iacute;a de los jud&iacute;os que abandonaron Europa lo hizo despu&eacute;s y no durante la guerra; lo cual no obsta para que se les incluya en el supuesto Holocausto.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Cu&aacute;ntos jud&iacute;os huyeron al interior de la Uni&oacute;n Sovi&eacute;tica?</B><BR>
M&aacute;s de dos millones. Los alemanes nunca tuvieron a su alcance a esta poblaci&oacute;n jud&iacute;a.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Cu&aacute;ntos jud&iacute;os emigraron antes de la guerra quedando, por lo tanto, fuera del alcance de los alemanes?</B><BR>
M&aacute;s de un mill&oacute;n (sin contar los que fueron absorbidos por la U.R.S.S.).<p>
<B><li>Si Auschwitz no fue un campo de exterminio, &#191;por qu&eacute; su comandante, Rudolf H&ouml;ss (no confundir con Rudolf Hess), confes&oacute; lo contrario?</B><BR>
Con H&ouml;ss se utilizaron m&eacute;todos muy eficaces para hacerle decir exactamente lo que sus captores quer&iacute;an escuchar.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Existe alguna prueba de que americanos, brit&aacute;nicos y sovi&eacute;ticos emplearon la tortura para forzar &quot;confesiones&quot; por parte de oficiales alemanes despu&eacute;s de la guerra?</B><BR>
Hay pruebas en abundancia de que la tortura se emple&oacute; tanto antes como durante los famosos juicios de Nuremberg y a&uacute;n despu&eacute;s, en otros juicios por cr&iacute;menes de guerra.<p>
<B><li>&#191;En qu&eacute; medida el mito del &quot;Holocausto&quot; beneficia actualmente a los jud&iacute;os?</B><BR>
Los sustrae de toda cr&iacute;tica como grupo social. Les proporciona un &quot;nexo com&uacute;n&quot; que permite el control por parte de sus l&iacute;deres. Es un instrumento &uacute;til en campa&ntilde;as de recolecci&oacute;n de fondos y permite justificar ayudas econ&oacute;micas a Israel que totalizan m&aacute;s de 10,000 millones de d&oacute;lares al a&ntilde;o s&oacute;lo por parte de los Estados Unidos.<p>
<B><li>&#191;En qu&eacute; medida beneficia al Estado de Israel?</B><BR>
Justifica los millones de d&oacute;lares -en concepto de &quot;reparaciones&quot;- que el Estado de Israel ha recibido de Alemania Federal (Alemania Oriental se neg&oacute; a pagar). Es usado por el grupo sionista israel&iacute; para controlar la pol&iacute;tica exterior norteamericana en sus relaciones con Israel y para forzar al contribuyente norteamericano a aportar todo el dinero que Israel desea. Y estos aportes son cada vez m&aacute;s voluminosos.<p>
<B><li>&#191;En qu&eacute; medida beneficia a algunos cl&eacute;rigos cristianos?</B><BR>
Correlaciona con la idea expuesta en el Antiguo Testamento en cuanto a que los jud&iacute;os ser&iacute;an el &quot;Pueblo Elegido&quot; perseguido. Tambi&eacute;n permite que la &quot;Tierra Santa&quot;, controlada por los israel&iacute;es, siga siendo accesible a la clerec&iacute;a.<p>
<B><li>&#191;En qu&eacute; medida beneficia a los comunistas?</B><BR>
Le permite al comunismo ocultar sus propias instigaciones b&eacute;licas y sus propias atrocidades; tanto las de antes como las de durante y despu&eacute;s de la Segunda Guerra Mundial.<p>
<B><li>&#191;En qu&eacute; medida beneficia a los brit&aacute;nicos?</B><BR>
En la misma forma en que beneficia a la Uni&oacute;n Sovi&eacute;tica.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Existe prueba alguna de que Hitler haya ordenado o sabido de un exterminio masivo de jud&iacute;os?</B><BR>
No.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; clase de gas fue utilizado por los nazis en los campos de concentraci&oacute;n?</B><BR>
Zyklon-B; un gas hidrocian&uacute;rico.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Para qu&eacute; usos fue -y sigue siendo- producido este gas?</B><BR>
Para exterminar al piojo causante del tifus. Es empleado en la fumigaci&oacute;n de habitaciones y vestimenta. Puede ser adquirido, sin dificultad, hasta el d&iacute;a de hoy.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Por qu&eacute; se us&oacute; este gas y no otro m&aacute;s adecuado para exterminios masivos?</B><BR>
Si los nazis hubieran querido usar gas para exterminar a seres humanos hubieran elegido alg&uacute;n otro entre los muchos que ten&iacute;an a su disposici&oacute;n. El Zyklon-B es muy ineficiente, excepto en su uso espec&iacute;fico como fumigante.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Cuanto tiempo se tarda en ventilar completamente un &aacute;rea fumigada con Zyklon-B?</B><BR>
Aproximadamente unas 20 horas. Todo el procedimiento es sumamente complejo y t&eacute;cnico. Se tienen que usar m&aacute;scaras antigas y s&oacute;lo pueden ser empleados t&eacute;cnicos altamente capacitados.<p>
<B><li>H&ouml;ss, el comandante de Auschwitz, afirm&oacute; que sus hombres entraban en las c&aacute;maras de gas, para remover los cad&aacute;veres, diez minutos despu&eacute;s de que los jud&iacute;os hab&iacute;an muerto. &#191;C&oacute;mo se explica esto?</B><BR>
No se explica de ning&uacute;n modo porque, si los hombres de H&ouml;ss hubieran efectivamente hecho algo as&iacute;, habr&iacute;an terminado sufriendo el mismo destino que los jud&iacute;os.<p>
<B><li>En sus confesiones, H&ouml;ss afirm&oacute; que sus hombres fumaban cigarrillos mientras sacaban a los jud&iacute;os muertos de las c&aacute;maras de gas, diez minutos despu&eacute;s de haber terminado la operaci&oacute;n. &#191;No es explosivo el Zyklon-B?</B><BR>
Lo es, y en alto grado. La confesi&oacute;n de H&ouml;ss resulta obviamente falsa.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Cu&aacute;l fue exactamente el procedimiento que supuestamente habr&iacute;an empleado los nazis para exterminar a los jud&iacute;os?</B><BR>
Las historias van desde dejar caer, a trav&eacute;s de una perforaci&oacute;n en el techo, contenedores de gas dentro de una habitaci&oacute;n atestada de gente, hasta la inyecci&oacute;n de gas a trav&eacute;s de ca&ntilde;er&iacute;as que terminaban en las duchas de las instalaciones sanitarias. Se alega que &quot;millones&quot; de jud&iacute;os habr&iacute;an muerto de esta manera. <p>
<B><li>&#191;C&oacute;mo pudo ser ocultado, a jud&iacute;os que a&uacute;n no hab&iacute;an sido arrestados pero que estaban destinados a ser exterminados, un plan masivo de estas proporciones?</B><BR>
No hubiera podido ser mantenido en secreto de ninguna forma. El hecho concreto es que no existieron gaseos masivos de este tipo en parte alguna. Los rumores acerca de los mismos provinieron exclusivamente de fuentes jud&iacute;as.<p>
<B><li>Si los jud&iacute;os destinados a ser ejecutados conoc&iacute;an el destino que les esperaba, &#191;por qu&eacute; fueron a la muerte sin luchar ni protestar?</B><BR>
No lucharon ni protestaron simplemente porque no existi&oacute; intenci&oacute;n de matarlos. Sencillamente se les internaba y se les obligaba a trabajar. (<I>N.del T.: actualmente, las autoridades israel&iacute;es se han dado cuenta de esta grave falla en el mito del &quot;Holocausto&quot; y por ello es que, de unos a&ntilde;os a esta parte, paralelamente al &quot;Holocausto&quot;, ha surgido el mito adicional de la &quot;her&oacute;ica resistencia&quot; supuestamente opuesta al &quot;exterminio&quot;.</I>)<p>
<B><li>&#191;Aproximadamente cu&aacute;ntos jud&iacute;os murieron en los campos de concentraci&oacute;n?</B><BR>
Entre 300,000 y 500,000.<p>
<B><li>&#191;En qu&eacute; forma murieron?</B><BR>
Principalmente por reiteradas epidemias de tifus que causaron estragos en la Europa sumida en la guerra de aquella &eacute;poca. Tambi&eacute;n murieron de inanici&oacute;n y por falta de atenci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica, hacia el fin de la guerra, debido a que todas las comunicaciones por ferrocarril y por rutas terrestres hab&iacute;an sido destruidas por el bombardeo aliado.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; es el tifus?</B><BR>
Es una enfermedad que siempre aparece cuando muchas personas se hallan encerradas juntas por largos periodos sin higienizarse. La enfermedad es portada por piojos que infectan el cabello y las ropas. Por ello es que las Armadas y los Ej&eacute;rcitos de todo el mundo tradicionalmente han impuesto cortes de cabello bien cortos a sus tropas. Ir&oacute;nicamente, si los alemanes hubieran usado mayores cantidades de Zyklon-B, muchos m&aacute;s jud&iacute;os hubieran podido salir con vida de los campos de concentraci&oacute;n.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; diferencia hay entre 6 millones y 300,000 jud&iacute;os muertos durante este tr&aacute;gico per&iacute;odo?</B><BR>
&#161;5,700,000! y aparte de ello -contrariamente a la propaganda del &quot;Holocausto&quot;- no hubo intenci&oacute;n deliberada de exterminar a nadie.<p>
<B><li>Muchos sobrevivientes jud&iacute;os de los &quot;campos de exterminio&quot; afirman haber visto pilas de cad&aacute;veres amontonados en fosas y quemados. &#191;Cu&aacute;nto combustible hubiera hecho falta para llevar a cabo esta operaci&oacute;n?</B><BR>
Bastante m&aacute;s de lo que dispon&iacute;an los alemanes con la cr&oacute;nica falta de combustible que ya sufr&iacute;an por aquella &eacute;poca.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Pueden los cuerpos humanos ser quemados en fosas?</B><BR>
No. Es imposible que un cuerpo humano se consuma totalmente por las llamas de este modo ya que, en fosas abiertas, no puede ser generado el calor necesario.<p>
<B><li>Los autores que afirman la existencia del &quot;Holocausto&quot; dicen que los nazis eran capaces de cremar un cuerpo humano en cerca de 10 minutos. &#191;Cu&aacute;nto tiempo se tarda en consumir un cuerpo humano, de acuerdo con el testimonio profesional de los operarios de crematorios actuales?</B><BR>
Aproximadamente unas dos horas.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Por qu&eacute; hab&iacute;a hornos crematorios en los campos de concentraci&oacute;n?</B><BR>
Para disponer, eficiente e higi&eacute;nicamente, de los cad&aacute;veres causados por las epidemias de tifus.<p>
<B><li>Suponiendo un funcionamiento al 100% de TODOS los crematorios en TODOS los campos del territorio controlado por los alemanes, &#191;cu&aacute;l es la cantidad m&aacute;xima de cad&aacute;veres que hubiera sido posible cremar durante la totalidad del periodo en que dichas instalaciones crematorias estuvieron operando?</B><BR>
Unos 430,600.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Puede un horno crematorio operar al 100% en forma continua?</B><BR>
No. Un 50% resulta ya una estimaci&oacute;n generosa (12 horas por d&iacute;a). Los hornos crematorios deben ser limpiados regularmente y a conciencia cuando est&aacute;n en uso continuo.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Cu&aacute;nta ceniza queda de un cuerpo cremado?</B><BR>
Despu&eacute;s de haber pulverizado completamente los huesos, aproximadamente la cantidad equivalente al contenido de una caja de zapatos.<p>
<B><li>Si seis millones de personas fueron cremadas por los nazis, &#191;qu&eacute; pas&oacute; con las cenizas?</B><BR>
Eso es algo que todav&iacute;a tiene que ser &quot;explicado&quot;. Seis millones de cad&aacute;veres producir&iacute;an literalmente toneladas de cenizas. Sin embargo, no hay pruebas de la existencia de ning&uacute;n enorme dep&oacute;sito de cenizas de estas dimensiones.<p>
<B><li>Las fotos a&eacute;reas de Auschwitz (tomadas por los aliados durante el per&iacute;odo en que las &quot;c&aacute;maras de gas&quot;, supuestamente, se hallaban operando a pleno) &#191;muestran la existencia de c&aacute;maras de gas?</B><BR>
No. En realidad estas fotograf&iacute;as ni siquiera muestran indicio alguno de las enormes cantidades de humo que habr&iacute;an existido en forma constante sobre el campo. Tampoco muestran las &quot;fosas abiertas&quot; en las que se alega que se quemaban cad&aacute;veres.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; dispon&iacute;an, esencialmente, las &quot;Leyes de Nuremberg&quot; alemanas de 1935?</B><BR>
Prohib&iacute;an el matrimonio y las relaciones sexuales entre alemanes y jud&iacute;os de un modo similar al de las leyes que existen hoy en Israel.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Hay precedentes norteamericanos de esas leyes alemanas?</B><BR>
Varios estados de los EE.UU. tuvieron leyes que prohib&iacute;an el matrimonio y las relaciones sexuales entre personas de distintas razas, mucho antes de que surgiesen los nazis.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; fue lo que inform&oacute; la Cruz Roja Internacional en relaci6n con la cuesti&oacute;n del &quot;Holocausto&quot;?</B><BR>
El informe de un delegado de la Cruz Roja Internacional que visit&oacute; Auschwitz en septiembre de 1944 se&ntilde;alaba que a los internados se les perniit&iacute;a recibir correspondencia y encomiendas, y que los rumores referentes a las c&aacute;maras de gas no hab&iacute;an podido ser confirmados.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Cu&aacute;l fue el papel desempe&ntilde;ado por el Vaticano durante el per&iacute;odo en que se dice que fueron exterminados los seis millones?</B><BR>
Si hubiera habido un plan de exterminio, el Vaticano ciertamente se hallaba en posici&oacute;n de conocerlo. Pero, puesto que no existi&oacute; plan alguno de este tipo, el Vaticano careci&oacute; de razones para adoptar p&uacute;blicamente una posici&oacute;n contraria al mismo.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; prueba hay de que Hitler orden&oacute; o supo que se estaba realizando un exterminio de jud&iacute;os?</B><BR>
Ninguna.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Hubo colaboraci&oacute;n entre los nazis y los sionistas?</B><BR>
S&iacute;. Ambos estaban interesados en sacar a los jud&iacute;os de Europa y mantuvieron relaciones amistosas durante la guerra.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; fue lo que caus&oacute; la muerte de Ana Frank varias semanas antes del fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial?</B><BR>
Tifus.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Es aut&eacute;ntico el Diario de Ana Frank?</B><BR>
No. Las pruebas recopiladas por Ditlieb Felderer en Suecia y por el Dr. Robert Faurisson en Francia prueban, definitivamente, que el famoso Diario es una falsificaci&oacute;n literaria.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; pasa con las numerosas fotograf&iacute;as tomadas en los campos de concentraci&oacute;n alemanes y que muestran pilas de cuerpos fam&eacute;licos? &#191;Son fotos trucadas?</B><BR>
Las fotograf&iacute;as pueden ser trucadas, sin duda. Pero es mucho m&aacute;s simple agregarle una acotaci&oacute;n o un comentario falaz a una foto o a un recorte fotogr&aacute;fico aut&eacute;ntico. Por ejemplo: una pila de cad&aacute;veres fam&eacute;licos &#191;es prueba de que se trata de gente &quot;gaseada&quot; o deliberadamente hambrienta hasta morir? &#191;O es que la fotograf&iacute;a muestra a v&iacute;ctimas de una tremenda epidemia de tifus? &#191;O a personas que murieron de hambre por la carencia de alimentos en los campos hacia fines de la guerra? Fotograf&iacute;as de pilas de cad&aacute;veres de ni&ntilde;os y mujeres alemanas, masacradas por los bombardeos aliados, se han hecho circular como fotograf&iacute;as de v&iacute;ctimas jud&iacute;as.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qui&eacute;n instituy&oacute; el t&eacute;rmino &quot;genocidio&quot;?</B><BR>
Raphael Lemkin, un jud&iacute;o polaco, en un libro que se public&oacute; en 1944.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Son documentales pel&iacute;culas como la del &quot;Holocausto&quot;  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; o &quot;The Winds of War&quot;?</B><BR>
No. Estas pel&iacute;culas no son hist&oacute;ricas sino basadas en novelas y ficciones basadas en la Historia. Desafortunadamente, es demasiada la gente que las ha tomado como representaci&oacute;n fidedigna de lo que realmente sucedi&oacute;.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Cu&aacute;ntos libros se han publicado en los que se refutan afirmaciones de la versi&oacute;n oficial del &quot;Holocausto&quot;?</B><BR>
Por lo menos 60. Y hay m&aacute;s en proceso de elaboraci&oacute;n.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; sucedi&oacute; cuando el Instituto de Revisi&oacute;n Hist&oacute;rica ofreci&oacute; 50,000 d&oacute;lares a cualquiera que pudiese probar que hubo jud&iacute;os gaseados en Auschwitz?</B><BR>
No se aport&oacute; ninguna prueba que mereciese la recompensa ofrecida, pero el Instituto fue demandado por 17 millones de d&oacute;lares por un sobreviviente del &quot;Holocausto&quot;, quien alega que la oferta le ha hecho perder el sue&ntilde;o, lo ha perjudicado comercialmente y representa una &quot;negaci&oacute;n injuriante de hechos establecidos&quot;.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; hay de cierto en la afirmaci&oacute;n de que quienes cuestionan el &quot;Holocausto&quot; son antisemitas o neonazis?</B><BR>
Se trata de una infamia destinada a desviar la atenci&oacute;n de hechos concretos y de argumentos contundentes. Entre los investigadores que han refutado los alegatos del &quot;Holocausto&quot; los hay de todas las ideolog&iacute;as: dem&oacute;cratas, republicanos, libertarios, socialistas, cristianos, jud&iacute;os, etc... No hay correlaci&oacute;n entre la refutaci&oacute;n del &quot;Holocausto&quot; y el antisemitismo o el neonazismo. De hecho, cada vez son m&aacute;s los investigadores jud&iacute;os que reconocen abiertamente que las pruebas referentes al &quot;Holocausto&quot; resultan altamente insuficientes.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Qu&eacute; sucedi&oacute; con los historiadores que cuestionaron la documentaci&oacute;n del &quot;Holocausto&quot;?</B><BR>
Han sido objeto de campa&ntilde;as difamatorias, expulsiones de puestos acad&eacute;micos, p&eacute;rdida de pensiones, destrucci&oacute;n de sus propiedades y violencia f&iacute;sica.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Ha sufrido el Instituto de Revisi&oacute;n Hist&oacute;rica (Institute for Historical Review) alguna represalia por sus esfuerzos en mantener el derecho a la libertad de palabra y a la libertad acad&eacute;mica?</B><BR>
El IHR ha sufrido atentados con bombas cinco veces y ha sido dos veces objeto de demostraciones por parte de representantes de la Liga de Defensa Jud&iacute;a (Jewish Defense League) que portaban banderas israel&iacute;es y profer&iacute;an amenazas de muerte. Amenazas de muerte hechas por tel&eacute;fono son, pr&aacute;cticamente, un hecho cotidiano. El 4 de julio de 1984, las oficinas y almac&eacute;n del IHR fueron completamente destruidos en un delito de incendio.<p>
<B><li>&#191;Por qu&eacute; hay tan poca publicidad sobre el punto de vista de ustedes?</B><BR>
Porque, por razones pol&iacute;ticas, el &quot;Establishment&quot; no desea ninguna discusi&oacute;n con profundidad sobre los hechos que rodean el mito del &quot;Holocausto jud&iacute;o&quot;.<p>
<B><li>&#191;D&oacute;nde puedo obtener m&aacute;s informaci&oacute;n sobre la &quot;otra cara&quot; de la historia del &quot;Holocausto&quot;, as&iacute; como sobre hechos referentes a otras &aacute;reas del revisionismo hist&oacute;rico de la Segunda Guerra Mundial?</B><BR>
Puede escribir a: Institute for Historical Review, Post Office Box 2739, Newport Beach, California 92659, U.S.A., que tiene una gran variedad de libros, casettes y videocasettes sobre importantes cuestiones hist&oacute;ricas y que adem&aacute;s publica una revista trimestral.<P>

<H1>Horst Wessel</H1><P>

Por<B> Bruno Renoult</B><P>

Una de las figuras m&aacute;s importantes del movimiento nacionalsocialista es sin duda la del joven Horst Wessel, Jefe de una Secci&oacute;n SA en Berl&iacute;n que fue asesinado a los 19 a&ntilde;os.<BR>
Hijo de un pastor protestante, ingres&oacute; muy pronto en la SA, para convertirse en poco tiempo en Sturmf&uuml;hrer (Jefe de Secci&oacute;n en la unidad No 5, de un barrio c&eacute;ntrico de Berl&iacute;n). Asiste a todos los Congresos del Partido y se le ve tanto en Munich, como en Nuremberg o Braunschweig, donde desfila a la cabeza de su Secci&oacute;n.<BR>
El 29 de Septiembre de 1929, el peri&oacute;dico de Goebbels, <code>&quot;</code>Der Angriff<code>&quot;</code>, publica una poes&iacute;a del joven Wessel: <code>&quot;</code>Die Fahne Hoch<code>&quot;</code> (Bandera en alto), que m&aacute;s tarde se har&iacute;a famosa, como veremos.<P>
<B>SER NACIONALSOCIALISTA EN EL BERL&Iacute;N ROJO</B> <P>
E1 combate pol&iacute;tico de principios de los a&ntilde;os 30 y sobre todo en Berl&iacute;n, se sit&uacute;a en la calle. En seg&uacute;n que barrios, n o estaba bien visto llevar la camisa parda, y los militantes nacionalsocialistas se encuentran enfrentados a verdaderas organizaciones terroristas de la &eacute;poca, como el Frente Rojo, que reagrupa al KPD (Partido Comunista Alem&aacute;n), el SPD (Partido Socialista Alem&aacute;n), y a otras diferentes organizaciones israelitas, marxistas y liberales. Ser nacionalsocialista en seg&uacute;n qu&eacute; barrios de Berl&iacute;n, tales como Wedding, Moabit o Kopenick era pr&aacute;cticamente una locura. Los comunistas se hab&iacute;an convertido en verdaderos guardias que vigilaban y toda aparici&oacute;n de camisas pardas era considerada una provocaci&oacute;n por aqu&eacute;llos que se cre&iacute;an los &uacute;nicos con el poder de dirigirse al pueblo. Amenazas, ataques a militantes en solitario, barricadas y asaltos a salas de reuniones del partido, estaban a la orden del d&iacute;a. Todo ello ocurr&iacute;a sin que la polic&iacute;a republicana reaccionara y ante su total indiferencia...<BR>
Entre 1923 y 1933, el terror rojo caus&oacute;, s&oacute;lo entre los miembros de la SA, unos 170 muertos, as&iacute; como millares de heridos, sin contar a los ca&iacute;dos de otras organizaciones del Partido. Por ejemplo, en un mismo ida fueron asesinados tres SA de Berl&iacute;n-Kopenick. Fue la llamada <code>&quot;</code>Blutswoche<code>&quot;</code> (Semana de la Sangre). Estos tiempos de lucha se encuentran magn&iacute;ficamente descritos por el Dr. Goebbels en su libro <code>&quot;</code>Kampfum Berl&iacute;n <code>&quot;</code> (Lucha por Berl&iacute;n), as&iacute; como en la reciente obra que sobre la Hitlerjugend (capitulo 11), ha escrito nuestro camarada Javier Nicol&aacute;s (pedidos a Ediciones Nothung).<P>
<B>DIECINUEVE A&Ntilde;OS DE UN JOVEN DE LA SA</B><P>
Horst Wessel naci&oacute; en Bielefeld, una ciudad en el coraz&oacute;n del <code>&quot;</code>Teutoburguer Wald<code>&quot;</code> (Bosque Teut&oacute;nico), en 1911. M&aacute;s tarde su padre se instal&oacute; en Berl&iacute;n para cumplir con su ocupaci&oacute;n de pastor en la parroquia de San Nicol&aacute;s.<BR>
Entretanto estalla la I Guerra Mundial y el padre sirve al lado del Mariscal Hindenburg, de quien se har&iacute;a amigo personal. Durante este tiempo, el joven Horst se encontraba ya a la cabeza de sus camaradas en la escuela y en la calle, donde asist&iacute;a a la amenazante Revoluci&oacute;n Bolchevique de Berl&iacute;n en 1919.<BR>
Tras frecuentar diversos grupos patri&oacute;ticos alemanes, Horst Wessel ingresa, muy joven, en el NSDAP de Berl&iacute;n, combatiendo simult&aacute;neamente a los comunistas y a la burgues&iacute;a. Estudiante de derecho, fue recibido en la corporaci&oacute;n de los <code>&quot;</code>Normannen<code>&quot;</code>. Orador y combatiente, a veces volv&iacute;a a casa en estado penoso, para gran horror de su madre, que entretanto se hab&iacute;a quedado viuda. Esto oblig&oacute; a Horst a alejarse del <code>&quot;</code>Berl&iacute;n Rojo<code>&quot;</code> y march&oacute; a Viena para continuar sus estudios. All&iacute; aprovech&oacute; para estructurar las secciones de la HJ (Hitlerjugend) austr&iacute;aca. De nuevo en Berl&iacute;n, pasa del <code>&quot;</code>Sturm 1<code>&quot;</code> al <code>&quot;</code>Sturm 5<code>&quot;</code>, con el que recorre, a bordo de camiones, la regi&oacute;n de Brandenburg, llevando buenas noticias a todos, en plan campa&ntilde;a publicitaria y en una atm&oacute;sfera alegre, a pesar del evidente riesgo que ello supon&iacute;a frente a los comunistas.<BR>
Un ida que se dirig&iacute;a a la Universidad, cerca de la Alexander Platz, conoce a una chica llamada Erna Jaenke. Se enamoran y deciden vivir juntos en contra de la voluntad de la madre de Horst, que decide no pagarle m&aacute;s sus estudios. Horst realiza todo tipo de trabajos para poder vivir y pagar su casa, ocup&aacute;ndose adem&aacute;s de las actividades de la SA.<BR>
Con ocasi&oacute;n de una salida de monta&ntilde;a, su joven hermano Werner Wessel, muere durante una tempestad de nieve. Horst vuelve a Berl&iacute;n moralmente destrozado, para llevar su cuerpo en un cami&oacute;n. Marcado duramente por esta nueva prueba, cae enfermo y debe permanecer en cama un tiempo. Sus camaradas Bruno, Richard y Albert, van a verle para levantarle la moral.<P>
<B>SE GESTA SU MUERTE</B><P>
Su portera, Frau Salm, viuda de un comunista, queriendo desembarazarse de este personaje que le ca&iacute;a mal, organiza un embrollo con el pretexto de un alquiler impagado y convoca a un grupo de comunistas de los bajos fondos de Berl&iacute;n, del <code>&quot;</code>Frente Rojo de Combate<code>&quot;</code>, para intimidarle.<BR>
Una tarde de invierno y comandados por la jud&iacute;a Else Cohn, un grupo dirigido por Ali Hohler (un macarra), hizo acto de presencia en el estudio de Horst Wessel, en el que viv&iacute;a con su compa&ntilde;era Erna Jaenke. Este abri&oacute; sin dudar la puerta y recibi&oacute; varios disparos de revolver, siendo abatido por un tiro en la mand&iacute;bula. R&aacute;pidamente intervienen sus camaradas y le llevan al Hospital de la Friedrichshain. El mismo Dr. Goebbels viene a verle varias veces, as&iacute; como el Pr&iacute;ncipe August Wilhelm de Prusia, miembro de la SA, pero sobre todo su hermana Inge. Durante todo un mes lucha entre la vida y la muerte, para fallecer finalmente de septicemia.<BR>
El proceso que tuvo lugar contra los asesinos bajo el r&eacute;gimen de la Rep&uacute;blica de Weimar, relaj&oacute; pr&aacute;cticamente a los asesinos, y hubo que esperar a la llegada del NSDAP al poder para hacer justicia. Ali Hohler y la jud&iacute;a Else Cohn fueron ejecutados.<P>
<B>LAS CONSECUENCIAS</B><P>
El asesinato de este militante del NSDAP, fue considerado por sus resentidos camaradas como una horrible y macabra provocaci&oacute;n por parte de los judeo-marxistas. Enseguida se decide a nivel nacional del Partido, organizar unos funerales grandiosos en respuesta a este crimen, aunque esta imagen de fuerza no causar&aacute; el efecto deseado, de hacer cesar todos los asesinatos, pero servir&aacute; de ocasi&oacute;n para demostrar la capacidad de disciplina del NSDAP y de excusa para una manifestaci&oacute;n .<BR>
Lo que persegu&iacute;an los comunistas era la prohibici&oacute;n de todo el Movimiento. Para ello no cesan en sus provocaciones e incluso asesinatos. En esa misma linea de incitar a una reacci&oacute;n violenta, con ocasi&oacute;n de los funerales por Horst Wessel, los comunistas organizan verdaderos grupos armados que deben atacar al cortejo f&uacute;nebre. Adem&aacute;s. &eacute;ste &uacute;ltimo se ve&iacute;a obligado a pasar por los alrededores de la <code>&quot;</code>Karl Liebcknet Haus<code>&quot;</code> (Sede del Partido Comunista), para dirigirse hacia el cementerio Nicolai.<P>
<B>DEMOSTRACI&Oacute;N DEL 23 DE FEBRERO DE 1930</B><P>
El reportero del peri&oacute;dico del NSDAP (<code>&quot;</code>Volkischer Beobachter<code>&quot;</code>), nos describe as&iacute; la manifestaci&oacute;n:<BR>
<code>&quot;</code>En los alrededores de la Friedrichshain, en direcci&oacute;n a la colina Prenzlauer, se pueden percibir a los contrarios, que se aglutinan a medida que bajan del tranv&iacute;a. La calle Konigstor est&aacute; llena de gente y, a pesar de su disimulo se puede reconocer a los miembros de la SA, llegando por su parte tambi&eacute;n en tranv&iacute;a. En la entrada del cementerio una veintena de SA limpian la pared de desagradables pintadas, antes de que pase el cortejo f&uacute;nebre. La polic&iacute;a republicana toma esto como pretexto para detenerles (!).<BR>
A medida que los SA van entrando en el cementerio, se despojan de abrigos y chaquetas para quedarse en camisa parda, a pesar del glacial viento de Febrero. En seguida se forman en columnas de protecci&oacute;n a ambos lados de donde deber&aacute; pasar el cortejo. El cementerio va llen&aacute;ndose m&aacute;s y m&aacute;s mientras se aproxima la columna f&uacute;nebre con m&aacute;s de 10.000 personas.<BR>
Este es el momento esperado por los comunistas, creando la confusi&oacute;n necesaria para conseguir m&aacute;s v&iacute;ctimas. En un momento dado las cuadrillas rojas se abalanzaron sobre la carroza funeraria tirada por caballos para apoderarse del f&eacute;retro, llegando a sacudir todo el carruaje. Ante semejante profanaci&oacute;n, la polic&iacute;a por una vez, interviene sin miramientos, haciendo retroceder a los atacantes. Los SA, por su parte, permanecen firmes, a pesar de la lluvia de objetos que caen sobre ellos, demostrando una disciplina ejemplar y enorme voluntad. En este &uacute;ltimo viaje de Horst Wessel se agrupan los trabajadores vestidos cada uno seg&uacute;n su ocupaci&oacute;n: los panaderos con sus gorros y ropas blancas, los cerveceros con sus correspondientes atuendos azules, los empleados de tranv&iacute;as, de ferrocarriles y correos, etc. Tambi&eacute;n se ven numerosos uniformes de la HJ, SA y SS, as&iacute; como miembros del <code>&quot;</code>Stahlhelm<code>&quot;</code>, sin olvidar mujeres del <code>&quot;</code>Deutsche Frauen Orden<code>&quot;</code> y del NSF.<BR>
La tumba se encuentra no lejos del muro trasero del cementerio, rodeado por los inmuebles de la cercana calle. Algunos centenares de comunistas se hab&iacute;an reunido all&iacute; y profer&iacute;an gritos salvajes, todo esto acompa&ntilde;ado de un diluvio de piedras que tiraban por encima del muro.<BR>
Desde la tercera planta del inmueble contiguo se oy&oacute; una risa hist&eacute;rica, efectivamente, alguien pudo reconocer la cara de aquella horrible vieja de aspecto jud&iacute;o.<BR>
A la salida del cementerio, los SA que hab&iacute;an permanecido impasibles ante las provocaciones judeo-comunistas, pudieron al fin limpiar la calle de canallas y de turba internacionalista, que llena habitualmente los viejos fondos de la capital<code>&quot;</code>.<BR>
El periodista del <code>&quot;</code>Volkischer Beobachter<code>&quot;</code> contin&uacute;a:<BR>
<code>&quot;</code>Nuestro grupo, dirigi&eacute;ndose de la Prenzlauer Strasse en direcci&oacute;n a Alexander Platz, esquina con la Konigsstrasse, vio aproximadamente a un centenar de comunistas maltratando a cinco hombres de la SA. En medio del tumulto y del tr&aacute;fico de veh&iacute;culos, los camaradas se lanzaron al asalto, brazo en alto, gritando <code>&quot;</code>Heil Hitler<code>&quot;</code> y <code>&quot;</code>Deutschland Envache<code>&quot;</code>, precipit&aacute;ndose sobre la horda roja para liberar a los cinco SA. Los rojos huyeron velozmente en todas direcciones para reunirse en los bajos fondos que nunca han abandonado totalmente...<BR>
Esta jornada en honor de Horst Wessel configur&oacute; m&aacute;s que un entierro, una marcha triunfal hacia un futuro siempre m&aacute;s duro y fuerte para el movimiento. Y durante mucho tiempo, los hombres del <code>&quot;</code>Sturm 5<code>&quot;</code>, guardaron su tumba de ida y de noche<code>&quot;</code>.<P>
<B>SU LEGADO (LA HERENCIA DE HORST WESSEL)</B><P>
Tras aquel ida memorable, la tumba de la familia Wessel fue modificada y sirvi&oacute; de soporte a un monumento de bronce, representando una bandera iz&aacute;ndose que simbolizaba el himno que &eacute;l mismo hab&iacute;a escrito a&ntilde;os atr&aacute;s: <code>&quot;</code>Die Fahne hoch<code>&quot;</code> &oacute; Bandera en alto.<BR>
Horst Wessel no muri&oacute; en vano. Las cuatro magnificas estrofas de lo que lleg&oacute; a ser el <code>&quot;</code>Horst Wessel Lied<code>&quot;</code>, el himno oficial del NSDAP, nos recuerdan a aquellos que cayeron bajo los disparos del Frente Rojo y la Reacci&oacute;n, sus esp&iacute;ritus marchan junto a nosotros en nuestras filas...<BR>
La tumba del peque&ntilde;o cementerio Nicolai lleg&oacute; a convertirse en el lugar de peregrinaci&oacute;n obligado para todo militante que pasaba por Berl&iacute;n, como lo era la Feldherrnhalle de Munich. El nombre de Horst Wessel fue dado a diferentes calles de la nueva Alemania, as&iacute; como a la estaci&oacute;n de metro m&aacute;s pr&oacute;xima del barrio Berl&iacute;n&eacute;s donde vivi&oacute; Horst. Cada aniversario fue conmemorado de manera grandiosa. El mismo F&uuml;hrer estuvo all&iacute; y tom&oacute; la palabra al pie de su tumba (con la camisa parda), bajo la nieve y los escu&aacute;lidos &aacute;rboles con un fervor m&aacute;s fuerte que nunca.<BR>
En 1944 se constituy&oacute; la Divisi&oacute;n SS <code>&quot;</code>Horst Wessel<code>&quot;</code>, as&iacute; como la Divisi&oacute;n <code>&quot;</code>Feldherrnhalle<code>&quot;</code>, que durante los terribles finales combates del Reich contra los sovi&eacute;ticos, quer&iacute;a rememorar el ardor de los primeros tiempos de lucha en los combates por conquistar el Berl&iacute;n rojo y el sacrificio de Horst Wessel.<BR>
En 1945 se produjeron combates con los rusos en aquel mismo cementerio, quedando como testigos los impactos sobre las tumbas.<BR>
Para nosotros, los camaradas nacionalsocialistas, Horst Wessel no ha desaparecido, sigue presente en su himno y no existe apenas un s&oacute;lo pa&iacute;s de Europa entera, Am&eacute;rica del Norte o del Sur, pasando incluso por &Aacute;frica, en el que cincuenta y ocho a&ntilde;os m&aacute;s tarde no se haya entonado de nuevo este canto simb&oacute;lico de nuestra lucha eterna.<BR>
Pero, ?qu&eacute; ha sido de la tumba de nuestro camarada?.<P>
<B>DESCUBRIMOS LA TUMBA DESAPARECIDA DE HORST WESSEL</B><P>
Tras el apocal&iacute;ptico final de 1945, el monumento de la tumba fue desmontado y la sepultura parcialmente desmoronada. Parece ser que alg&uacute;n miembro de la familia de Horst sobrevivi&oacute;, su hermana, que reconstruy&oacute; lo que pudo con las piedras, dando a la tumba un aspecto humano.<BR>
Con la muerte de su hermana, la tumba fue abandonada.<BR>
Con ayuda de un viejo plano de Berl&iacute;n, pudimos situar la estaci&oacute;n de metro <code>&quot;</code>Horst Wessel<code>&quot;</code>, hoy llamada <code>&quot;</code>Rosa Luxemburg<code>&quot;</code> y ubicada a pocos metros de la Friedrichshain. Pero ?c&oacute;mo situarla sobre el terreno, sabiendo que el coraz&oacute;n de Berl&iacute;n fue pr&aacute;cticamente arrasado en 1945?. Adem&aacute;s, ?c&oacute;mo localizar los vestigios de una tumba sin hacerse detectar por los funcionarios de ese cementerio, sabiendo que el menor de los cementerios de Berl&iacute;n ocupa varias hect&aacute;reas?.<BR>
Afortunadamente, cincuenta y ocho a&ntilde;os m&aacute;s tarde, los ancianos se acuerdan -como es el caso de dos mujeres de Berl&iacute;n Este de cierta edad, que nos orientaron amablemente de d&oacute;nde se encuentra la tumba. Esto ocurr&iacute;a ante el estupor de un viandante, probablemente funcionario del Partido &Uacute;nico en la RDA, para quien <code>&quot;</code>Horst Wessel<code>&quot;</code> representaba a&uacute;n al <code>&quot;</code>terror<code>&quot;</code> pardo.<BR>
Por suerte, el viejo cementerio Nicolai se encontraba intacto en la Prenzlauer Strasse, limitando con barrios completamente arrasados y reconstruidos al estilo <code>&quot;</code>staliniano<code>&quot;</code> de los a&ntilde;os 50. El muro sobre el cual los SA hab&iacute;an limpiado las inscripciones antes del entierro, estaba a&uacute;n en pie.<BR>
Entramos por un peque&ntilde;o porche sobrepuesto en el que figuraba a la inscripci&oacute;n de principios de siglo: <code>&quot;</code>Alte Nicolai Friedhof<code>&quot;</code>.<BR>
Con ayuda de unas fotos de &eacute;poca encontradas en un &aacute;lbum de familia com&uacute;n, hemos buscado el emplazamiento de la tumba, encontrando intactos los mausoleos a lo largo del muro. El inmueble desde donde gritaba la vieja jud&iacute;a, seg&uacute;n la informaci&oacute;n del <code>&quot;</code>Volkischer Beobachter<code>&quot;</code>, desapareci&oacute; en la tormenta de 1945.<BR>
Tomando medidas de acuerdo con los informes que nos daban, nos tropezamos con una piedra recubierta por la vegetaci&oacute;n , sobre la cual el &oacute;xido de antiguas letras de bronce dejaron una inscripci&oacute;n que todav&iacute;a puede leerse: <code>&quot;</code>Ludwig Wessel<code>&quot;</code>, padre de Horst, as&iacute; como la forma de una Cruz de Hierro, que este recibi&oacute; en la I Guerra Mundial.<BR>
En uno de los lados de la piedra rectangular, que no es sino una cuarta parte del monumento original, se distinguen a&uacute;n las patas de fijaci&oacute;n de las letras de bronce arrancadas, de una antigua inscripci&oacute;n, la misma que se distingue en la foto de la &eacute;poca. En la prolongaci&oacute;n de la piedra, una elevaci&oacute;n de la tierra parece indicar la sepultura misma. En partes del terreno se han encontrado trozos del brocal que rodeaba el monumento al pie del cual Hitler y Goebbels tomaron la palabra.<BR>
Con una gran emoci&oacute;n limpiamos la sepultura con nuestros camaradas de Berl&iacute;n y entonamos, brazo en alto, las estrofas del <code>&quot;</code>Horst Wessel Lied<code>&quot;</code>, en el crep&uacute;sculo de esa jornada glacial de Febrero, junto a la tumba de nuestro camarada presente, junto a nosotros, en nuestras filas cincuenta a&ntilde;os despu&eacute;s.<P>

<H1>La importancia de<BR>
 la integridad personal</H1><P>

<I>Texto publicado por CEDADE</I><P>

Cuando nos encontramos en momentos de crisis, o dudamos sobre el camino correcto, o participamos en conversaci&oacute;n es en que todo es puesto en duda; el hombre moderno corre el riesgo-carente de principios inmutables, como es com&uacute;n, de perder el rumbo y naufragar, dando al traste con todo aquello que hasta entonces le hab&iacute;a parecido s&oacute;lido y v&aacute;lido. O lo que es peor, puede caer f&aacute;cilmente en la confusi&oacute;n producida por los especialistas del lenguaje.<BR>
Hay un tipo de gente, por ejemplo, que no habiendo hecho suyo ning&uacute;n valor como norma de vida, lo dudan y critican todo, en discusiones o escritos nefastos. De esta gente abunda en el Sistema actual. Y dentro del campo nacionalsocialista no nos libramos de esta especie, claro contagio del ambiente que nos rodea. Hay incluso pueblos que tienen facilidad para la palabra, lo mismo que otros la tienen para la poes&iacute;a, la deducci&oacute;n, la inteligencia trascendente o la inventiva t&eacute;cnica, manual, etc. Curiosamente es el pueblo de Israel uno de los m&aacute;s dotados en el dominio de la palabra. N o es de extra&ntilde;ar pues, que en un mundo en que este pueblo goza del mayor poder, vivamos constantemente bombardeados, envueltos y dominados por la ingenier&iacute;a de la palabra.<BR>
La mejor y &uacute;nica soluci&oacute;n para tapar la boca a este tipo de personas, que habla demasiado y cuyo comportamiento no suele ser consecuente, es situar las cosas otra vez sobre el verdadero terreno: el Honor y l a integridad personal.<P>
<B>EL HONOR</B><P>
El Honor, palabra casi desaparecida de la vida cotidiana, toma para el Nacionalsocialismo un valor especial.<BR>
Para el Nacionalsocialismo recuperan su sentido todos los Valores, todo aquello que, por pertenecer al campo del esp&iacute;ritu, el mundo actual ha combatido o desde&ntilde;ado. Los valores, adem&aacute;s, forman parte de nuestro c&oacute;digo gen&eacute;tico.<BR>
Pero de todas formas, existe una &eacute;tica europea, bien diferente de la de otras razas o pueblos, que se&ntilde;ala un modo propio de comportarse. El Honor es uno de estos valores que consideramos fundamental es, tanto dentro de CEDADE como en el futuro Estado.<BR>
Por el contrario, el Sistema imperante considera el Honor como algo humillan te, puesto que su actualizaci&oacute;n pondr&iacute;a al descubierto la falta de integridad de los prohombres del r&eacute;gimen actual.<BR>
No escapa a nadie que buen a parte de los parlamentarios espa&ntilde;oles juraron fidelidad al r&eacute;gimen de Franco, para traicionar este juramento m&aacute;s tarde y volver a <code>&quot;</code>jurar<code>&quot;</code> a la nueva constituci&oacute;n democr&aacute;tica. Esto es as&iacute;. Si alguien les llama traidores o perjuros al verlos por la calle, no les insultan, sino que los describen con claridad seg&uacute;n el diccionario de la lengua espa&ntilde;ola. Estos dais se ven por las calles de Barcelona carteles que la extrema izquierda ha desplegado por doquier, reproduciendo unas fotograf&iacute;as de Franco con una alta personalidad del Estado actual. Dios nos libre de compartir estas ilegales ideas de la izquierda, pero debemos reconocer que los hechos son de una manera y n o como a nuestros gobernantes les gustar&iacute;a que fuesen.<BR>
Los campesinos de ciertas regiones de Europa, los vaqueros de Santander, por ejemplo, todav&iacute;a cierran con tratos con un apret&oacute;n de manos. Es la forma m&aacute;s viva del Honor de un pueblo. Aquel trato no hay quien lo cambie. Por su parte, Himmler dict&oacute; una orden interna de modo que en las SS no deb&iacute;an realizarse contratos por escrito, ni firmarse papelotes al respecto. La palabra de Honor de un SS deb&iacute;a ser sagrada. En la <code>&quot;</code>SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler<code>&quot;</code>, los armarios de la tropa deb&iacute;an permanecer sin llave. La propiedad de un camarada es in tocable. Los integrantes de esta Divisi&oacute;n de &eacute;lite estaban orgullosos de ello.<BR>
Cuando hablo con &eacute;l por tel&eacute;fono, un camarada suele responder a mis dudas sobre l as afirmaciones de este o aqu&eacute;l : <code>&quot;</code>no se puede dudar de la palabra de un nacionalsocialista<code>&quot;</code>. Me satisface escuchar tal convencimiento, por mucho que dude de algunos camaradas in maduros por juventud o in decentes por demasiado sabios.<P>
<B>LA FIDELIDAD</B><P>
La fidelidad es sin duda el 6e central de la &eacute;tica nacional socialista.<BR>
Si nos ligamos al Nacional socialismo mediante el v&iacute;nculo indestructible de la Fidelidad, no podemos ni tenemos el derecho de romper este arma y escudo espiritual formidable.<BR>
Cuando los <code>&quot;</code>chismes<code>&quot;</code> hacen su aparici&oacute;n, la Fidelidad los hace pedazos. Cuando la envidia y la indisciplina hacia el mando son promovidas por enanos para contentar a est&uacute;pidos, la Fidelidad se alza impenetrable. Cuando muchos caen en la trampa y se intenta abandonar a los que cayeron por nuestros mismos ideales, s&oacute;lo la Fidelidad puede salvarnos del caos. Cuando los a&ntilde;os pasan y la debilidad humana se hace notar, cuando empezamos a decir lo que no pensamos para <code>&quot;</code>disfrazarnos<code>&quot;</code> y acabamos pensando lo que decimos; &uacute;nica y exclusivamente la Fidelidad nos puede se&ntilde;alar otra vez el camino correcto.<BR>
Un guionista puso en boca de Thomas Moro que <code>&quot;</code>Hay cosas que la fidelidad a mi Rey no me permiten o&iacute;r<code>&quot;</code>. Un tal grado de lealtad es dif&iacute;cilmente encontrable, toda vez que ese mismo rey, su amigo, ordenar&iacute;a su ejecuci&oacute;n.<P>
<B>LA IMPORTANCIA DE LA INTEGRIDAD PERSON AL</B><P>
Si nos guiamos por estos valores, hay momentos en que la vida parecer&aacute; m&aacute;s dura para un o de lo que pueda serlo para otros, cuyo comportamiento se adapta siempre a las circunstancias; pero en realidad todo es m&aacute;s claro, m&aacute;s sencillo y a la larga m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil para vivir.<BR>
Si observamos con detenimiento, veremos que probablemente no quede en la sociedad actual m&aacute;s moral que la cat&oacute;lica y la nacionalsocialista. No es que haya otras morales diferentes, es que en realidad no existen y por lo tanto no pueden ser adaptadas como norma de vida.<BR>
Si conversando alguien discute sobre si quiere tener hijos o no, si estos le quitan a la pareja los a&ntilde;os de juventud en que puede ser feliz, s&oacute;lo traen problemas y suponen un a carga vital; habr&aacute; quien est&eacute; dispuesto a consumir todo tipo de anticonceptivos para evitar su llegada y otros que, a lo sumo, decidan traer al mundo uno o dos descendientes. Para el cat&oacute;lico las cosas son mucho m&aacute;s transparentes: el matrimonio tiene como una de sus misiones m&aacute;s importantes, tener una numerosa prole. Esto es as&iacute; de claro. Es probable que para &eacute;ste &uacute;ltimo la vida resulte menos c&oacute;moda, m&aacute;s cansada y llena de problemas, pero en &uacute;ltima instancia habr&aacute; cumplido con su deber y su F&eacute; y, como he dicho antes, la vida le traer&aacute; muchas otras alegr&iacute;as, totalmente desconocidas por la s parejas de egoc&eacute;ntricos que creen ver en la propia satisfacci&oacute;n el &uacute;nico fin de este mundo.<BR>
Si en otra ocasi&oacute;n alguien comenta las ventajas y desventajas que acarrea el divorcio, anteponiendo sin embargo la propia felicidad por el f&aacute;cil camino de la satisfacci&oacute;n personal por una nueva belleza, un gran amor a primera vista, etc.; para el cat&oacute;lico todo es mucho m&aacute;s rotundo: la fidelidad a la propia esposa es fundamental.<BR>
Podr&iacute;amos a&ntilde;adir aqu&iacute; otros ejemplos pero creo que son suficientes para llegar al terreno propuesto. La moral cat&oacute;lica -de hecho y probablemente la &uacute;nica aplicable y &uacute;til en el Occidente actual- coincide plenamente con el Nacionalsocialismo en much&iacute;simos aspectos. Este &uacute;ltimo ofrece al hombre una soluci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica y humana en este mundo, la primera ofrece una soluci&oacute;n para la otra vida. Pero ambos coinciden en ofrecer un mismo comportamiento &eacute;tico y decente, por la v&iacute;a de la dureza y la austeridad con uno mismo, como base para vivir correctamente.<BR>
No es casual que ambas concepciones del mundo, la terrenal supeditada evidentemente a la metaf&iacute;sica, sean el objetivo predilecto de los unimundistas, que han volcado todas sus fuerzas en desarraigar a los pueblos y vaciarlos de toda moralidad.<BR>
La integridad personal es pues muy importante y de hecho ha de ser proyectada en todas las facetas de la vida: la fidelidad pol&iacute;tica, la ideolog&iacute;a, la camarader&iacute;a, la amistad, las relaciones con el otro sexo, la relaci&oacute;n padres-hijos y viceversa.<BR>
Si en nuestro campo tenemos ejemplos a miles y muchos de ellos descomunales, del cumplimiento de estos principios; en el campo democr&aacute;tico-marxista es todo lo contrario. No hace mucho, un chiste aparecido en la prensa dibujaba a un t&iacute;pico <code>&quot;</code>progre<code>&quot;</code> de izquierdas que comentaba desmoralizado algo as&iacute;: <code>&quot;</code>Los socialistas prometieron un cambio y s&oacute;lo han cambiado lo que prometieron... Los comunistas tomar el <code>&quot;</code>Palacio de invierno<code>&quot;</code> y ni los invitan a la <code>&quot;</code>Moncloa<code>&quot;</code>... La derecha conservar la sociedad y no conservan ni una coalici&oacute;n... Los centristas ofrecer un punto de encuentro y ya tienen cinco... Los autonomistas acabar con el centralismo y s&oacute;lo quieren triunfar en Madrid... Vuelvo a la Iglesia: me dijo que el divorcio era malo !y signe dici&eacute;ndolo!<code>&quot;</code>.<BR>
A lo largo de los a&ntilde;os, en la lucha pol&iacute;tica tendremos numerosas ocasiones de comprobar hasta qu&eacute; punto es importante la integridad personal. Al no conseguir el &eacute;xito, surgen enseguida los que encuentran que el problema est&aacute; en una ideolog&iacute;a err&oacute;nea, o en un lastre hist&oacute;rico demasiado pesado que no debemos arrastrar por m&aacute;s tiempo, o en la falta de <code>&quot;</code>modernidad<code>&quot;</code> de nuestros planteamientos, etc. Cuando se empieza con esto, no hay lugar para discusiones bizantinas que pueden alargarse indefinidamente y que no hacen m&aacute;s que destruir la unidad y cohesi&oacute;n internas. Entonces hay que poner las cosas, como hemos dicho, sobre el terreno de la integridad personal: fidelidad, lealtad, honradez, honor...<BR>
Tampoco faltan discusiones sobre la culpabilidad de este o aquel miembro en el devenir de los acontecimientos. Ante esto s&oacute;lo hay una respuesta posible: <code>&quot;</code>No permito que delante m&iacute;o nadie hable mal de otro miembro de la organizaci&oacute;n, sea quien fuere y sea cual sea mi simpat&iacute;a hacia &eacute;l. Es mi camarada hasta que los mandos no decidan lo contrario<code>&quot;</code>. En este sentido, y dada la multiplicidad de gentes que opinan que todo es mejor, todo se hace mejor y todos son mejores que los que forman en la organizaci&oacute;n -por mucho que pocos hacen algo-, el planteamiento m&aacute;s contundente es: Todo el que est&aacute; en la organizaci&oacute;n me interesa y el que est&aacute; fuera no.<BR>
Cuando un camarada llega a personificar lo que siempre se ha tenido por un hombre honrado, hace el mayor de los favores a la causa nacionalsocialista, puesto que sirve de punto de referencia para todos los que le rodean y conocen sus convicciones ideol&oacute;gicas y pol&iacute;ticas.<BR>
Acabemos pues teniendo bien presente el lema que circulaba en los ambientes nacionalsocialistas: <code>&quot;</code>Si act&uacute;as bien hablar&aacute;n bien de ti, pero si act&uacute;as mal hablar&aacute;n mal del Partido<code>&quot;</code>.<P>

<h1>White Nationalism--Key Concepts</h1><p>

<strong>by Yggdrasil</strong><p>
<br>

<b><i>Concept 1 -</i> There is nothing sacred about having several
races in the same country.</b><p>

If having several different races in the same country works,
then fine. Keep the arrangement. If it doesn't, then scrap it.
There are no moral imperatives involved in the deciding whether
to have one country or several. The issue should be decided based
on practicality. The solution that reduces conflict and provides
the greatest degree of happiness to the most people is the one to
be pursued.<p>

In the United States, we are taught that racial integration is a
moral imperative. This morality is the self-interested creation
of planters and industrialists interested in cheap labor. It is a
morality created to facilitate what Alvin Toffler describes as
the "second wave" industrial economy.<p>

It was very much in the interests of planters and industrialists
to import whomever they wish to facilitate rapid growth and keep
wages low.  Any cultural and non-economic costs of learning to
adapt to one another were imposed on the existing inhabitants and
were not borne by the planters or industrialists individually.<p>

In other parts of the world, races come to be included in the
same nation by way of military conquest and colonization. For
colonizers, drawing borders in such a way as to include several
races makes it possible to pit one race against another,
rendering the colony easier to control. Niccolo Machiavelli
describes the strategy in his work "The Prince."<p>

<b><i>Concept 2 -</i>  When several races are placed in a single
country, conflict arises.</b><p>

For all the talk about the "brotherhood of man" examples of
several races getting along in a single country for an extended
period are either few or non-existent.<p>

Racial and ethnic groups always compete.<p>

With the advent of "multiculturalism" the U.S. is rapidly
balkanizing. It is only a matter of time before conflict
escalates.<p>

<b><i>Concept 3 -</i> Races will choose different methods of
competition depending on their circumstances.</b><p>

In the United States, we are taught that majorities always
oppress minorities.<p>

In truth, both minority and majority races compete for status and
power in a multi-racial county. They typically compete using
different means and strategies. Obviously, a minority will
attempt to conceal its aggressive agenda so as to lull the
majority into political complacency.<p>

To be successful, minorities must be content with indirect racial
victories masked from majority view by universalisms like
"fairness," "tolerance" and "compassion".  To be successful,
minorities must conceal their explicit racial agenda from the
majority.  Thus, minorities will seek to dominate the public
discourse concerning the terms of their interaction with the
majority.<p>

However, the achilles heel of minority control is their ability
to keep the non-elite members of their own group content with the
fruits of this indirect aggression against the majority.<p>

Once a significant number of any racial minority becomes
dissatisfied and desires the more intense pleasures of direct
racial confrontation with the majority, the game is very near an
end.<p>

In contrast, with raw numbers on their side, majorities will
almost always assert their racial interests in direct ways.
Because of this, it is easy to portray a majority as crude and
insensitive when it begins to assert its racial interests in the
public debate even if only in self-defense.<p>

<b><i>Concept 4 -</i>  A minority will expend great effort in defining
the conditions of its interaction with the majority.</b><p>

The most successful minorities will expend great amounts of
energy convincing their racial opponents that they are not
competing. Competition and conflict take many forms. Outright
violence gets the headlines. However, less visible forms of
ethnic conflict always occur. The political struggles for
preferences and group advantages that take place in the
legislatures always favor organized minorities over complacent
majorities.<p>

Successful minorities will attempt to dominate all communications
media to the point where they can prevent the dissemination of
any message that calls attention to minority racial and ethnic
dominance.  Only messages of minority victimization are allowed
to pass.  Serious discussion of these issues in books and
periodicals directed at the elites are spoken in "code" so that
they cannot alarm the majority.<p>

Control of the terms of interaction between minority and majority
demands sufficient control over public morality to ensure that
demands to block negative messages will be obeyed by the majority
elites. It does not require direct ownership or control over all
communications media.<p>

<b><i>Concept 5 -</i> Majority elites typically benefit from the
presence of minority races and will ordinarily oppose the
racial interests of their own kind.</b><p>

Think about it!  An elite would never allow the importation of a
racial minority unless it benefitted from the minority's
presence.  So naturally, once the minority has arrived, the
majority elite will protect that minority as long as the majority
elite continues to benefit.<p>

It makes perfect sense that the elite will invent new secular
moral imperatives of tolerance and respect for minorities and
demand that the majority learn, believe and follow those new
imperatives.<p>

<b><i>Concept 6 -</i> New immigrants struggle to gain supremacy over
the earlier arrivals.</b><p>

If you examine the history of the migrations to the United
States, it is clear that each new wave of arrivals struggles to
supplant the earlier arrivals and that most such groups succeed.<p>

The earliest arrivals were the Puritans 1620-1680 (largely,
descendants of Danish invaders of England).  Once they subdued the
indians, later arrivals of English Episcopalians sought to
displace the puritans economically and politically.  The contest
was fought with cultural and political tools, and the new
Episcopal arrivals won.<p>

When the earlier arriving Celtic "Anglo Saxons" inhabiting the
Southern States attempted to secede, this new Episcopal elite
fought the bloodiest war in U.S. history to suppress them.<p>

Beginning in 1880, a new wave of Jewish and Southern European
immigrants began arriving in the U.S. they too supplanted the
earlier English Episcopalian elite in wealth, education and
political power within 50 years of their arrival.<p>

Immigrant groups will invest a great deal of effort creating
myths surrounding the hardships encountered on first arrival to
deflect attention from their quick acquisition of economic and
political power. The myths about hardship and "discrimination"
confer upon these new elites "victim status" which insulates them
from criticism by the less fortunate and more complacent
descendants of earlier arrivals.<p>

<b><i>Concept 7 -</i> The masses of a majority race are likely to go
along with importation of different races as long as the
majority elite demands that new immigrants assimilate.</b><p>

If the majority elite demands that the new arrivals assimilate,
this is a recognition that the current inhabitants do not have to
give up their culture to accommodate the new arrivals.  New
arrivals must strive to become as much like the existing
inhabitants as possible and must strive to limit the potential
sources of friction.<p>

Once the elites of the majority race drop their demands for
minority assimilation, the minorities will tend to accentuate
their differences with the majority. Conflict, whether cultural,
political or physical, will escalate.<p>

<b><i>Concept 8 -</i> Majority elites will abandon integrationism as
soon as it ceases to benefit them.</b><p>

Until approximately the mid-1980's large corporations and
government bureaucracies created hundreds of thousands of middle
management positions to be filled by "generalist" college
graduates.<p>

New computer technologies are rapidly replacing these
"generalist" knowledge workers. Prior to the advent of these
technologies, "how you behaved" was more important than your
technical knowledge.  To be assured a middle class position in one
of these bureaucracies, you only needed to learn the liberal
propaganda at college. Not much else mattered.<p>

In exchange for belief in liberalism and integrationism, Euro-
American elites were rewarded with middle class jobs. In short,
they were bought off. There were direct economic rewards for 
liberalism.<p>

That is no longer so.<p>

Race based hiring preferences have largely eliminated access to
these middle management jobs in government and regulated utilities.
Technology is eliminating these positions in the private sector.<p>

In the past, you went to college to learn what to say.  One slip
of the anti-egalitarian tongue and you ended up in the mail room. 
Absent 1300 plus combined SAT scores and critical knowledge skills,
you will end up in the mail room anyway if you are White.<p>

Increasingly, the behavior and manners of egalitarian belief are
becoming less relevant to earning a middle class living.<p>

Correspondingly, the economic incentives for mouthing
integrationist and egalitarian viewpoints are eroding
dramatically.  This is an economic trend that will not reverse
itself any time soon.<p>

In the future it is going to become much more difficult for the
minority elites to find sufficient numbers of Euro-American front
men throughout our institutions to lull the majority back to
sleep. Anti-egalitarian dissenters will proliferate from within 
the information elites.<p>

It is going to be much more difficult to sustain the idea in the
minds of the average European-American that this is their
country.<p>

<h1>Christianity--Religion of the West</h1><p>

by Prof. Revilo P. Oliver<p>

<i>The late Revilo Oliver was Professor of the Classics at the University 
of Illinois in Urbana and was one of America's greatest patriots.</i><p>

"These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, 
saying, Go NOT unto the way of the heathen...but go rather
to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."  (Matt. 10:5-6)<p>
 
YOU, WHO ARE now reading these lines, and I are strangers.  
I have no means of knowing whether you are a Christian or 
an atheist.  That, however, will not matter, so long as we 
talk about facts and not wishes.<p>

The observed and verifiable facts of the world about us 
are not affected by religious faith or the lack of faith.  
Christians and atheists must find themselves in perfect 
agreement when they affirm that lead is more malleable 
than steel, that the earth is an oblate spheroid rotating on its 
axis, that whales are mammals, that Germany was defeated 
and devastated by the many nations allied against her in 
1945, and that the Chinese are Mongolians.<p>

About such matters there can be no dispute among 
Western men, who instinctively accept the reality of the 
world about us and CANNOT believe, as do many 
Orientals, that it is merely an illusion in the mind of a 
dreamer.<p>

If we would salvage and restore our civilization -- the 
Occidental culture that is peculiarly our own and that now 
seems to be disintegrating and rotting before our very eyes 
-- we must do so as Western men, by observing reality 
objectively and by reasoning from it dispassionately.  And 
when we try to compute what resources remain to us, we 
need first of all to determine the actual strength of the 
Christian tradition at the present time.<p> 
 
<center><b>The West and Christianity Synonymous</b></center><p>

It is a fact, which Christians will regard with satisfaction 
and some atheists may deplore, that Western civilization in 
the sense that the great majority of the people belonging to 
it (though never, at any time, ALL of them) believed 
implicitly in the truth of the Christian revelation.  That 
religious unanimity was for a long time so nearly complete 
that, after the fall of the Roman Empire and the evanescence 
of hopes for its restoration, we of the West regarded our 
religion as the bond that united us and distinguished us 
from the rest of the human species.<p>

During the Middle Ages, our ancestors occupied the 
greater part of Europe, and, until they discovered the 
American continents, they lived only in Europe, but despite 
that geographical unity, they did not generally refer to 
themselves as the Europeans.  For all practical purposes, 
furthermore, our ancestors belonged to the same division of 
the White race: they, like the true Greeks and the true 
Romans before them, were all members of the great race 
that we now call Indo-European or Aryan, but they had in 
their languages no word to designate their blood 
relationship and biological unity.  Thus, when they referred 
to the unity of which they were always conscious as 
something transcending the constantly shifting territorial 
and political divisions of Europe, they called themselves 
Christendom.  And for many centuries that word was 
adequate and misled no one.<p>

For many centuries the West was Christendom and its 
civilization was indubitably Christian: that, whether you like 
it or not, is an historical fact.  There is a complementary 
historical fact that was less obvious at the time and that even 
thoughtful men overlooked or tried to ignore until the 
events of the past two decades made it indubitable: 
Christianity is a religion of the West, and, for all practical 
purposes, ONLY of the west.  It is not, as its polemical 
adversaries so often charge, a Semitic cult, for it has never 
commanded the adhesion of any considerable number of 
[Semites], and it is not, as Christians once generally 
believed, a universal religion, for experience has now 
proved that it cannot be successfully exported to 
populations that are not Indo-European.<p>
  
<center><b>Ascertained Facts Undeniable</b></center><p>

Experience has also proved that it does not do the 
slightest good to deny ascertained facts.  The men of 
Classical antiquity knew, of course, that the earth is 
spherical, and Eratosthenes in the third century B.C. 
calculated its circumference as 24,663 miles.<p>

But the early Fathers of the Church, living in the age of 
growing ignorance that shrouded the last century of the 
Roman Empire, decided, on the basis of some statements in 
the Old Testament, that the earth ought to be flat or, at least, 
no more curved than a shield.  Lactantius was the most 
eloquent and probably, therefore, the most influential of the 
many who assiduously demanded that the earth be flat and 
so imposed on their contemporaries the conviction that it 
was.  In the Middle Ages, to be sure, there were some 
learned men, such as Buridan, who knew that the globe is a 
globe, but they, like learned men today, who all know very 
well that talk about the equality of races is utter nonsense, 
usually refrained from publicly denouncing fashionable 
delusions.  It was not until the Fifteenth Century that the 
truth became again inescapable, but when it did, the 
Christians, being men of the West, who do not deny the 
lessons of experience, surrendered the comfortable error in 
which they had once generally believed; and since that time, 
no rational Christian has doubted that the earth is spherical.<p>
 
<center><b>Western Civilization Unexportable</b></center><p>

Today, as in the Fifteenth Century, Western men have 
had to discard a congenial assumption to bring their 
conception of the world into conformity with observed 
reality.  So long as we of the West held unquestioned 
dominion over the whole earth, we permitted ourselves to 
assume that our civilization in general, and our religion in 
particular, could be exported and made universal.  We did 
not sufficiently observe that talent for mimicry is common 
to all human beings and indeed to all anthropoids; that all 
human beings stand in awe of those who have power over 
them; and that a genius for dissimulation and hypocrisy is 
hereditary in the most intelligent Orientals.<p>

Even with these oversights, the evidence against our 
assumption was fairly clear, but in the pride of our power 
we felt that we could indulge an assumption that was so 
congenial to the romantic generosity that is a peculiarity of 
our race.  But the events of half a century, and especially of 
the past two decades, have shown us, beyond peradventure 
of doubt, the shape of the world in which we live.  We now 
know what our prolonged missionary effort, cultural as well 
as religious, accomplished -- and how its visible effects 
were produced.<p>
  
<center><b>Conversion by Cannon</b></center><p>

When Cortes and his small but valiant band of iron men 
conquered the teeming empire of the Aztecs, he was 
immediately followed by a train of earnest missionaries, 
chiefly Franciscans, who began to preach the Gospel to the 
native and soon sent home, with naive enthusiasm, glowing 
accounts of the conversions they had effected.  Their pious 
sincerity and innocent joy still lives in the pages of Father 
Shagun, Father Torquemada, and many others.  For their 
sake I am glad that the poor Franciscans never suspected 
how small a part they played in the religious conversions 
that gave them such happiness.  Far, far more persuasive 
than their sermons and their book had been the Spanish 
cannon that breached and shattered the Aztec defenses, and 
the ruthless Spanish soldiers who slew the Aztec priests at 
their own altars and toppled the Aztec idols from the 
sacrificial pyramids.<p>

The Aztecs, Tepanecs, and other natives accepted 
Christianity, not because their hearts were touched by alien 
and incomprehensible doctrines of love and mercy, but 
because it was the religion of the White men whose bronze 
cannon and mailclad warriors were invincible.<p>
  
<center><b>Military force -- Not Love</b></center><p>

That was early in the Sixteenth Century and even then 
there were not wanting indications that should have given 
pause to a critical mind, but we of the West went on 
repeating that found mistake for four centuries, as the 
missionaries whom we sent to all parts of the world wrote 
home glowing reports of the number of "hearts" they had 
"won for Christ."  It was only after our enemies' campaign 
of "anti-colonialism" really got under way that most of us 
realized that what had won all those hearts was primarily 
the discipline of British regiments and the manifest power 
of the White man.<p>

We now know what happened.  On many a shore of 
Africa, for example, missionaries eager to "win souls for 
Christ" ventured to land alone, and the aborigines, after 
mutilating and torturing them for a good communal laugh, 
ate them, cooked or raw according to the custom of the 
local cuisine.  Usually, a few weeks or a few months later, a 
British cruiser hove to off shore and lobbed half a dozen 
4.5 shells into the native village, and, if not pressed for time, 
landed half a company of marines to beat the bushes and 
drag out a dozen or so savages to hang on convenient trees.<p>

Consequently the tribe, if not very obtuse, took the hint 
and respected the next bevy of missionaries as some how 
representing the god of thunder and lightning.  And if the 
men of God distributed enough free rice and medical care 
with their sermons, they were able to make "converts," as 
the natives learned to utter the words that Christians like to 
hear.<p>
 
<center><b> White Missionaries Murdered</b><p></center>

That is, in essence, the whole history of "winning souls" 
among the savages.  There were, of course, many local 
variations.  If the first missionaries were preceded by 
troops or White settlers, the Blacks had already been 
convinced of the virtues of Christian rifles and had learned 
that White men should not be regarded as esculent 
comestibles.  If often happened, however, that the natives, 
ever after many years of preaching and conversion, rejected 
the White man's odd rites very emphatically, and a fresh 
supply of missionaries was needed.  In 1905, for example, 
the Maji-Maji conspiracy in Tanganyika murdered all the 
missionaries and almost all the White men and women in 
the entire territory, and it required a German regiment and 
several companies of marines to restore the teaching of the 
Gospel.  That was done by giving some forty or fifty 
thousand demonstrations that a Mauser bullet could 
penetrate even a Black hide that had been most carefully 
anointed with the grease of a boiled baby.<p>

The Christian missionaries did teach a ritual and often 
inculcated a superstition that had some superficial 
substance of Christianity, but they might as well have 
followed the example of St. Francis and preached sermons 
to the birds.  That is why the many, many thousands of 
devoted Christians who expended their whole lives to "save 
souls" built only an edifice of cardboard and tinsel that is 
now gone in the wind.<p>
  
<center><b>Christianity Incomprehensible to Natives</b></center><p>

What the vanishing of that flimsy facade has made 
obvious was predictable from the first.  The religion of the 
West has <b><i>never</i></b> been comprehensible to the rudimentary 
minds of Congoids, Capoids, and Australoids; races so 
primitive that they were congenitally incapable of inventing 
a wheel and even of using one without supervision -- races 
that could not develop for themselves even the first and 
simplest preliminaries of a civilization.<p>

When the missionaries invented systems of writing the 
crude languages of the primitives, they had also to invent 
words to express such concepts as 'God', 'soul,' 'justice,' 
'morality,' and 'religion' -- invent them by either creating 
new words or by perverting to such meanings sounds that 
in the native jargons conveyed impressions that were faintly 
and remotely analogous.  That fact alone should have made 
us think.<p>

It was clear, furthermore, that the "converts," even those 
who had been most thoroughly imbued with an awe of the 
god of repeating rifles and locomotives, would conform to 
the White man's morality only under coercion, and that 
whenever they escaped from the White man's supervision 
they spontaneously reverted not only to their own mores 
but also to whatever form of voodoo they had practiced 
before.<p>

Even if earlier experience had not been conclusive, what 
happened in Haiti at the very beginning of the Nineteenth 
Century should have removed the last lingering doubt.  But 
the missionaries did not learn, and the "Ladies' Missionary 
Society" went on contributing their mites, plying their 
needles, and glowing with tender emotion for the sweet little 
savages depicted by their romantic imaginations.<p>

Although it is true that in some places in the former 
colonial possessions missionaries are still tolerated, if they 
are obsequious to the natives and pay very well, we have at 
least learned that the Gospel follows the British regiments 
in the White man's ignominious and insane retreat from the 
world that was his.<p>

<h1>Why White Nationalism?</h1><p>

<b>by Yggdrasil</b><p>
<br>

There are two answers to the question: "Why White Nationalism?"<p>

<b><i>1. The futility of Conservatism!</i></b><p>

As we approach the millenium, the destruction of Western Civilization in
the United States is so complete that there is little left to conserve.
The original understanding that brought our ancestors to the United
States was the melting pot, the "color blind society" in which
individuals would be judged on merit and not on skin color. The original
understanding or social contract has been broken. Individuals are no
longer judged by their own merit.  The color blind society has simply
disappeared.  As a practical matter, it will never return. As a
consequence there is no longer any reason for a European-American (or
anyone else, for that matter) to attempt to slow down the rush towards a
balkanized United States. You cannot slow down something that has
already occurred.<p>

<b><i>2. To assert European-American interests in this new balkanized
society.</i></b><p>

All efforts of liberals at maintaining racial peace in the United States
are guided by the false assumption that hostility and anger by
non-Whites is provoked by "White racism."  The truth is that non-Whites
would be hostile toward us even if every European-American were a
saint.<p>

In every non-homogenous country in the world non-Whites have powerful
racial animosities. (See Yggdrasil's lesson #2). These reactions occur
whether Europeans are present or not. However, White liberals imagine
that once these people arrive on our shores they lose that natural and
universal propensity to dislike people of other races.<p>

To the liberal mind, Black and brown people arriving here either become
"saints,"  devoid of the natural inclination of men everywhere to
dislike people with different skin color, or become "new socialist man,"
motivated solely by calculations of economic self-interest and utterly
devoid of racial awareness. Thus, to a liberal, whenever Blacks or
browns become angry, they must have been provoked by "White racism."<p>

Now this unfortunate assumption places the average European-American in
a rather awkward position.  Every time Black and brown people raise a
stink about their status or treatment, the liberal assumes that there
must be hidden White racism somewhere, and that the way to appease the
Blacks and browns is to adopt new employment quotas, more contract
set-asides, new standards for race-normed testing or admissions
procedures, more stringent "hate crime" laws, more stringent censorship
of White speech to filter out anything that might be giving such
offense, and if all that fails, direct cash handouts (paid for by the
middle class, of course).

Now Black and brown people are not fools, they know they are being
rewarded for raising a ruckus.  So far, they keep getting the same
rewards for it. More ruckus leads to more benefits, more advantages,
more tribute, and more humiliation of the average White by their own
elites.  What a country!<p>

Now for the average European-American who just commutes to work in the
morning, has very little racial anger, and certainly doesn't want to
foment or participate in any "revolution," all of these concessions
present a dilemma. At some point, these undeserved burdens have to stop.
Yet the average European-American has been so tolerant of their
imposition, and the White liberal elites in charge have been so utterly
naive and misguided in their judgments about race, that there is no
visible mechanism or group that could possibly stop what is now
beginning to look like a massive racially-based attack.<p>

There are no European-American leaders who are willing to stand up and
state the obvious. It is the Blacks and browns who are racist.  It is
the Blacks and browns who are exploiting the race issue for advantage.
At some point, the White liberal elites are either going to have to say
"no" to the Black and brown racial aggressors, or those White elites
will have to be replaced with someone who can.<p>

Thus there is a practical advantage to be gained by bringing White
Nationalism out into the open. These White liberal elites are going to
have to understand that there are competent rebels within their midst
(within the information elites described by Herrenstein and Murray) who
feel a moral obligation to dissent and organize average 
European-Americans to resist their practice of rewarding Black and brown 
racial aggression.  It does not matter whether this practice arises out of a
sincere (if obviously silly) notion that only White racism could cause
Black and brown hostility,  or whether this practice is conscious
aggression on the part of an alienated White liberal elite motivated by
a need to show contempt for their fellow European-Americans. Either way,
it is going to stop. The only question is how "messy" the process of
stopping these practices is going to get.

<H3><i>Race Bias #1</i></H3>

<h1>Minority Engineers</h1>

<p>
In much of the racial dialogue in the U.S., integrationists dispute the
simple fact of anti-White bias in the system. Of course, the media
generally propagate our national myths--myths intended to hide the
ball from the majority.  But there is one major daily newspaper that is
overwhelmingly subscriber supported (and not supported by ad revenue).
So it is no surprise that this well known paper reports the facts.
<b>All</b> the facts.

So you White Nationalists and ultra-conservatives will want to save
every one of Yggdrasil's <b>daily</b> posts in this series, each with a
different article on the operation of private race preferences in the
United States. What makes these articles unique is that they involve
private anti-White bias, not anti-White bias compelled by government.
Save them all and have a database to support your arguments and your
research papers!<p>

The following article inaugurates this series on private anti-White
bias by U.S. companies.<p>

<b>Minority Grads Remain  In Demand Despite Slump</b><p>

The recession is crimping job offers for college seniors, but
competition will remain stiff for talented minority graduates,
consultants say.<p>

About 225 companies, filling all available slots, are vying for this
spring's 125 engineering graduates at Howard University. Slots to see
non-engineers are still available, but the black university is demanding
more from companies that have visited for years but left few job offers
behind.<p>

"We have to ask them, `Why are you coming?'" says Samuel Hall Jr.,
placement director. To improve their chances of landing Howard
graduates, Mr. Hall says, employers should commit to work with faculty
and support the school with money and resources.<p>

Maury Hanigan, a New York consultant who devises recruiting strategies
for Polaroid, Colgate-Palmolive and other firms, cautions, "If a company
is just starting to get active and serious with minorities, it may be
too late." Especially on black campuses, Ms. Hanigan says, a company's
record in hiring and promoting blacks plays a major role in determining
recruiting success, making it hard to play catch-up. After summer
internships, returning students quickly research others' experiences at
various companies "as if it were another course," Ms. Hanigan says.<p>

<b>Privacy, Recession Help Job Service Find Work</b><p>

HEADHUNTER William Ellis says the recession has helped him
start a novel computerized recruiting service.<p>

Interspace Interactive, New York, sells corporate
subscribers an on-line catalog of potential hires -- with
minorities accounting for some 60% of his 3,000-person
listing. Though companies are doing more firing than hiring,
Mr. Ellis says the recession helped make the service
marketable to employers by providing him with an ample pool
of candidates, who pay $25 a year to be listed.<p>

Interspace's electronic service, which has placed 15
people in three months, doesn't provide candidates' names or
current employers without their permission in each case. Mr.
Ellis says privacy gets him better candidates who don't want
their names widely circulated.<p>

Corporate clients, including Citicorp and Sony, pay $1,500
a year for the service, but commissions are only 15% of a new
hire's salary, compared with an industry standard of 25% to
30%.<p>

This is a fascinating tidbit on the wining and dining of minority
executives by corporations recruiting them.  Call it the scarcity
factor.  Note that these searches entail higher costs, with the
greatest successes occurring in the absence of real need. <p>

<b>Find the Candidate Before Panic Sets In</b><p>

COMPANIES SHOULD actively recruit minorities for top executive
posts even when there are no openings, says search firm Wesley.
Brown & Bartle. <p>

Some 85% of chief executives surveyed by the New York firm say
they're committed to hiring high-level minorities, but 62% report
a tough time finding such candidates when searching to fill an
opening says recruiter Wesley Poriotis. <p>

"Diversity hasn't got a chance once a position is open," Mr.
Poriotis says, because the employer isn't likely to make the
extra effort to seek out the right minority candidate under the
"stress and angst" of a formal search. <p>

To improve the odds, Mr. Poriotis tracks minority candidates
for clients before jobs open and brings the candidates and
employers together in informal meetings.  For both sides "it's
like shop 'til you drop, without the pressure to buy or sell,"
Mr. Poriotis says.<p>

"Whenever you're recruiting, the more immediate your need, the
greater pressure you're under and the more it limits the extent
of your search," says Gerald DePalma, senior vice president for
human resources at Schieffelin & Somerset Co. a New York beverage
marketer.  Mr. DePalma says Mr. Poriotis's approach has helped
him recruit minority managers because, when he has an opening, "I
already have someone who's been tracked."<p>

better plan your business very carefully. Again, this behavior is not 
compelled by law.<p>

Insurance & Annuity Association College Retirement Equities Fund
did recently.  It shepherded a joint venture between PM Realty
Group, Houston, a large white-owned manager of commercial
properties, and RMC Group, New York, owned by veteran black real
estate consultant Richmond McCoy.  The McCoy/PM Realty Group,
launched in June, is 52% owned by RMC and is the nation's largest
minority-owned full-service property manager.  To seal the deal,
TIAA-CREF and PM's parent, Jupiter Industries, Chicago, each
committed 1.25 million square feet of property for McCoy/PM to
manage.<p>

Patrick Jolivet, TIAA-CREF associate manager for real estate,
says he wanted to avoid creating a minority "front" firm -- one
only nominally controlled by minorities. He says the joint
venture creates "a truly minority-owned firm that can compete
with all other management-leasing companies on their own terms."<p>

Mr. McCoy says RMC Group, begun in 1991, stumbled at first by
focusing on corporate and government "set-aside" work and serving
other minority firms. "You go down that route, you're destined
for failure," he says, because that strategy doesn't generate
enough work.<p>

McCoy/PM has 3,500 employees -- mostly contributed by PM -- in
22 states.  Minorities are almost invisible as managers in the
management-leasing industry;  Mr. McCoy plans to hire minorities
"whenever possible" to change that.<p>

<h1>Finding Minority Suppliers</h1>
<p>

In much of the racial dialogue in the U.S., integrationists
dispute the simple fact of anti-White bias in the system.  Of
course, the media generally propagate our national myths--myths 
intended to hide the ball from the majority.  But there is
one major daily newspaper that is overwhelmingly subscriber
supported (and not supported by ad revenue).  So it is no
surprise that this well known paper reports the facts. <b>All</b> the
facts.<p>

A vast effort is underway in corporate America to prefer minority
owned business in contracting.  This practice is compelled by
minority  "set asides" in state and federal contracts.  However,
the practice is pursued as well by many businesses not under
government compulsion.<p>

The practice is so entrenched that a supporting industry has grown
up around supplying large American corporations with information
and contacts to minority business. The article quoted below is but
one example.<p>

These aren't preferences for $7 an hour jobs. We are talking about
real money here!<p>

<b>Supplying a Minority Or Female Supplier</b><p>

NEED a minority or female supplier fast? Thomas Publishing, a
95-year-old New York company that puts out reference books used
by manufacturers, recently started a service to connect
manufacturers with such suppliers.<p>

Many government and corporate programs require manufacturers
to use minority and women-owned suppliers. Users of Thomas's
service can search by telephone keypad through 3,500 product
categories and receive information on suppliers within an hour,
by fax.<p>

Thomas lists 10,000 suppliers so far and has started signing
up subscribers, at $390 a year. Suppliers are listed free of
charge, with self-reported information as to their certifications
as non-white-male-owned firms by government and private agencies.
About two-thirds of the suppliers in the database have no proof
of certification, however, because many companies ignore getting
such approvals.<p>

This worries Harriet Michel, executive director of the
National Minority Supplier Development Council, the largest
private certification group, because bogus "minority" suppliers
may mislead subscribers, at certified firms' expense.<p>

<h1>A Boost for Black Media</h1><p>

In much of the racial dialogue in the U.S., integrationists
dispute the simple fact of anti-White bias in the system. Of
course, the media generally propagate our national myths--myths 
intended to hide the ball from the majority.  But there is
one major daily newspaper that is overwhelmingly subscriber
supported (and not supported by ad revenue).  So it is no
surprise that this well known paper reports the facts. <b>All</b> the
facts.<p>

It is also no surprise that Time Warner backs Black-owned
entertainment firms. But in the article below, N.J. Nicholas,
Time Warner's President, says that "national tastes are made
in the Black community."<p>

Wishful thinking? Or just code words for how the entertainment
industry wants Whites to adopt Black culture?  Blacks have
greater brand loyalty, have a negative marginal propensity to
save as income rises, and are more given to impulse and status
motivated purchases.  If you are pushing ad time for beer,
automobiles and perfumes you want an audience responsive to
advertising!  Small wonder Time Warner wants Whites to adopt
Black culture.<p>

Hey folks. No ideology here!  Just good old fashioned self-interest!  
You see, if you are in the right business, White-hating is good business!<p>

<b>Time Warner Funds Black Media Firms</b><p>

WHAT DO producer Quincy Jones, publishers Charles Harris
and Donald Anderson, broadcaster Pierre Sutton and
cable-channel operator Robert Johnson have in common?<p>

They're emerging black media powers with the same titanic
silent partner: Time Warner. The alliances, most made since
1988, are strategic, says Time Warner president N.J. Nicholas
Jr., because many national tastes are made in the black
community.<p>

Time Warner stands behind Quincy Jones Entertainment Co.
in movies, television and records. "Fresh Prince of Bel Air"
is already a TV hit. Time Warner also has a stake in Black
Entertainment Television, the only black-oriented cable
service.<p>

Time Warner's minority stake in Emerge, a new magazine
which aims to lead black opinion, raised some
African-American eyebrows at first. But Mr. Anderson the
publisher says such liaisons will sharply expand the power of
black media ventures. "From a black perspective," he says, "I
hope like hell that somebody tries to copy this soon."<p>

Analysts were unaware of any imitators, but Raymond Katz
of Shearson Lehman Brothers says the Time Warner style has
always been to find talent in new markets, "plant the seed
and leave them alone."<p>

Mr. Nicholas says more deals will be forthcoming, perhaps
another magazine.<p>

<h1>Minority Layoff Protection</h1><p>

In much of the racial dialogue in the U.S., integrationists
dispute the simple fact of anti-White bias in the system. Of
course, the media generally propagate our national myths--myths 
intended to hide the ball from the majority.  But there is
one major daily newspaper that is overwhelmingly subscriber
supported (and not supported by ad revenue).  So it is no
surprise that this well known paper reports the facts. <b>All</b> the
facts.<p>

The following tidbit is a classic. Seniority as a criteria for
layoffs is abandoned by American business when it results in
dismissal of new minority hires.<p>

A long list of bad guys raise their heads up out of the foxhole
including General Motors (again), GM Hughes, AT&T, Honeywell,
Nynex Corp. and DuPont. <p>

But the shift to performance reviews to select who stays and who
goes raises fascinating questions:<p>

Can performance reviews be objective when their purpose is to
select White males for dismissal?<p>

Is the shift to performance reviews recognition that you must
increase the competence of the remaining pool of Whites, and make
them work harder, to limit the economic damage to the company
inflicted by retaining less competent minorities?<p>

Are the costs of early retirement window programs really a cost
of diversity efforts?<p>

<b>Companies Alter Layoff Policies to Keep Recently Hired Women and Minorities</b><p>

Sept. 18, 1992 <i>Wall Street Journal</i> p B1<p>

By Julie Amparano Lopez<p>

Staff Reporter of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> <p>

When companies lay off employees these days the last person
hired isn't automatically the first one fired. <p>

That's a big boost for women and minorities--but it can leave
senior white men out in the cold and employers in a quandary. 
Major corporations are dropping their "last hired, first fired"
rules in order to preserve their carefully cultivated ranks of
women and minorities, typically the newest hires. Employers don't
want to risk job-bias suits from women and minorities nor
jeopardize government contracts tied to affirmative-action
efforts. Business leaders say they also must retain women and
minorities to compete for an increasingly multi-ethnic and female
customer base. <p>

"Many companies are finding a 'last hired, first fired' policy
is too damaging to minorities and women," explains Judith Katz,
vice president of Kaleel Jamison Consulting Group, a management-
consulting firm in Cincinnati. "They're having to resort to other
means when downsizing." Among them: sweetened pensions to
encourage voluntary retirements, job sharing, reduced workweeks
and performance appraisals.<p>

<b> 'Only Fair Way'</b><p>

Not surprisingly, union leaders defend a seniority-based layoff
system, which remains common among unionized businesses.
Seniority is the "only fair way to handle layoffs," says Reg
McGhee, a spokesman for the United Auto Workers union. <p>

But many businesses that once cut jobs largely through
seniority - including Honeywell Inc., Du Pont Co. and American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. --say they must trim differently today
to protect women and minorities. Honeywell for instance, now uses
performance appraisals rather than seniority.<p> 

AT&T employed an early-retirement sweetener in 1989 to usher
12,500 managers, largely white males, out the door. It isn't
alone. About 40% of the nation's largest companies offered early-
retirement programs to employees during 1990 and 1991, according
to an August survey by consultants Wyatt Co.<p>

In a few unionized facilities. AT&T still lays people off based
on experience. But a decade ago, seniority was the only means
used to reduce employment.<p>

<b>Caught in the Crunch</b><p>

The changing corporate strategy means that older white men like
James J. Klinikowski, who is 61 years old, are often caught in
the crunch. The former AT&T technical-staff engineer and 12-year
veteran says he was laid off in 1990. "I won't take anything away
from women and minorities," Mr. Klinikowski says. "But there are
lots of people like myself who are getting squeezed out. It
doesn't seem fair." <p>

Even some white males who survive job cuts feel disheartened.
This can be seen at Nynex Corp., which launched an aggressive
diversity program in 1986 and which has eliminated 1,700 jobs
over the last year through performance reviews and cutting out
unnecessary positions. The downsizing largely has affected senior
white men. One 52-year-old white Nynex operations manager who
remains says he lives in constant fear of losing his job. "You
can't help but feel that no one cares about us," he says. <p>

That feeling is also likely to be strong among senior white men
at General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft Co. unit, especially
since its new chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, laid down the law.
Last June, Hughes announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs over the next
18 months. But the proportion of minority and female employees
won't decrease during the layoffs, Mr. Armstrong later told
senior management, according to company officials. <p>

"There's always the tendency" to consider women and minorities
first in cutting employment because they often are the most
recently hired, explains David Barclay, Hughes vice president of
work force diversity. "That's why we have to oversee the process
and look for ways to protect them." <p>

On top of this, the big defense contractor is eager to retain
its lucrative federal and state government contracts, which
usually require hiring goals for women and minorities. Hughes
plans to use performance appraisals and other non-seniority
strategies in making job cuts, Mr. Barclay says. The company is
providing severance packages that will cost about $17,000 per
terminated employee. <p>

Honeywell, which began restructuring its operations in 1987,
has relied on its performance-appraisal system to reduce
employment. Under this approach, the Minneapolis controls-systems
concern first determines that a particular department is
overstaffed. After exempting critical jobs, Honeywell managers
decide which positions can be performed by others or are
unnecessary. Then they cut posts based on individual performance. <p>

"Performance appraisals are a fairer process" than seniority,
explains Barbara Jerich, Honeywell's director of work-force
diversity. "They help weed out insidious biases against women,
minorities or people with disabilities," she explains, adding
that the performance appraisals "have concrete criteria on which
everyone is judged." <p>

Still, Honeywell's practice disturbs some white male managers,
who contend that they are being dismissed disproportionately. Ms.
Jerich recently met with a group of these managers to allay their
anxieties. She spelled out Honeywell's layoff strategies and
explained why a diverse work force is important. Other companies,
such as AT&T, are setting up special classes and programs to help
these demoralized white male managers. <p>

But hostility can get intense. A black female banker in Los
Angeles found that she was the only one in her 12-person
department who didn't get laid off last year. All of her other
colleagues were white men. Since transferred to another division,
she says her new white male colleagues are angry that she was
given a job.<p>

"I don't get asked to join them for lunch. They look at my work
harder. They don't think I deserved to keep my job," she says. 
In some cases, a new approach to layoffs has helped to boost the
ranks of female and minority employees. Philadelphia Electric Co.
reports that the share of its supervisors who are women has
increased to 12% from 5% in 1989 while the proportion who belong
to minority groups has risen to 9% from 6% three years ago. In
1989, the utility largely abandoned its seniority-based policy in
favor of an early retirement program. <p>

When Du Pont drafted its downsizing plan in mid-1991, the
Wilmington, Del., chemical maker largely wanted to reduce
staffing costs by $1 billion without destroying its 13-year
effort to recruit more women and minorities. <p>

"Historically, in manufacturing plants a seniority system has
been used to reduce the work force," says Faith Wohl, who manages
Du Pont's diversity and family programs. But with a corporate
policy that women and minorities must constitute at least 45% of
all new hires, she adds, "we weren't eager to lose something that
we had worked on so carefully" since 1979. <p>

Du Pont wants to cut 700 of its 72,427 U.S. jobs by the end of
1993 through a sweetened early-retirement program. The company is
looking for excess positions in each unit and then asking
eligible individuals to retire early.- Company wide, Du Pont's
early-retirement push has trimmed 7,600 jobs since summer 1991,
saving about $700 million. <p>

"So far, we've managed our downsizing with all volunteers," Ms.
Wohl says. "We've been lucky. We haven't had to make any
layoffs." <p>

In turn, the reduced number of older workers has pushed up Du
Pont's employment of women and minorities slightly to 17% and 12%
respectively, a gain of about one percentage point since 1990.
Concludes Ms. Wohl: "We are changing the mix of the work force,
but it's a painful process." <p>

intended to hide the ball from the majority.  But there is

A preferred way to favor minorities in business is for a
restaurant chain to grant franchises to minority owners on a
preferential basis.<p>

Typically, the parent corporation provides 100% financing.<p>

The snippet below is included to show that being a minority is
the <b>only</b> way to get a franchise from Pizza Hut, a Pepsi unit.
(Coke is worse, as we shall see later!).<p>

<b>Former Pizza Hut Official Takes Big Franchise Slice</b><p>

PIZZA HUT christened the nation's largest black-owned
fast-food franchise company last month.<p>

Larry Lundy, until recently the chain's vice president of
restaurant development, purchased 31 stores in the New
Orleans area for a price that industry specialists estimate
at $15.5 million.<p>

Pizza Hut, a PepsiCo subsidiary, says it is making
developing minority franchises a priority. Last fall the
chain put another former executive, Mexican-American Eugene
Camarena, into 12 Amarillo, Texas, stores. In both cases,
Pizza Hut, which owns more than half of the chain's 7,500
U.S. stores, sold pieces of its own territory. Being a
minority "is now the only way to get into a Pizza Hut
franchise at this time," says Vincent Berkeley, vice
president, minority affairs.<p>

But the company's system historically has been hard for
minorities to crack. Unlike other chains, Pizza Hut
franchises large, exclusive geographic areas, making it tough
for newcomers to start businesses from one or two stores.<p>

Pizza Hut won't disclose figures, but sources familiar
with the chain say it has about 300 minority-owned stores.
That figure probably will shrink soon. The company is
expected to buy about 240 stores from Cuban-American
franchisee Arturo Torres to resolve a legal dispute.<p>

intended to hide the ball from the majority.  But there is

<b>Seeking Minority Talent For Higher Levels</b><p>
 
DEMAND for minority managers is heating up, executive
recruiters say. <p>

Richard Clarke Associates, a New York-based firm that
specializes in searches for minority managers reports its
minority-search assignments jumped 50% in September from a year
earlier. Amanda Fox, a vice president in the Chicago office of
recruiters Paul R. Ray & Co., says businesses request minorities
and women in 65% of the firm's executive searches, up from 40% a
year ago. <p>

One reason for the increase: Corporations that haven't
successfully promoted minorities now are looking outside for
qualified candidates to fill senior positions. Richard Clarke,
president of the search firm bearing his name, says companies
realize they must diversify their top ranks to remain competitive
in recruiting lower-level talent.<p>

Recruiters say most searches for minority executives are to
fill director and vice presidential positions in the sales,
marketing and computer fields. <p>

The increased demand is prompting many search firms to set up
separate arms for minority recruiting. Ward Howell, a New York
firm, established a diversity practice last year. Though it
focuses mainly on finding minority talent, the unit also advises
companies on retaining and promoting minority employees, says
Larry Poore,its head.<p>
