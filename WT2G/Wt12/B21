<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>A</FONT>ngela Brasher makes friends easily. She's soft-spoken but accessible. Her toothy smile and expressive brown eyes make people feel comfortable immediately. Angela also has a fast right hand that can peel the skin off your face and turn your brains into lumpy tapioca pudding.</P>





<P>That's just fine with Bob Chambers, who watches Angela with fascination and admiration. He's a veteran coach and manager who, at 54, finds himself squarely in the middle of the hottest revolution in sports--women's boxing.</P>





<P>"She impresses me a lot because she's got so much heart. She picked it up just like that," says Chambers, who is surrounded by boxing trophies at his desk at the Riverside Community Center in Indianapolis. "There's a lot she's gotta work on, but she works real hard."</P>


<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="boxing1.jpeg">



<P>It's been true throughout history that, while the sport's brutality repulses some women, others find themselves inexplicably drawn to boxing and its gladiators. Chambers even remembers a brave few who would venture into the ring to work out as early as the 1960s when he was a promising light heavyweight. In the last few years, though, an increasing number of women around the country have thrown serious punches of their own, competing alongside men in the "sweet science." They fought in obscurity, of course, and most of the grizzled gym rats considered them nothing more than novelties--when they considered them at all.</P>





<P>Then Christy Martin, 27, decisioned Deirdre Gogarty of Ireland in a furious six-round prelim to the recent Mike Tyson-Frank Bruno WBC heavyweight championship bout. Covered in her own blood, Martin triumphed over stereotype, and suddenly even the old men took notice. </P>



<P>There are women ready to bake in the rays of Martin's celebrity. Sue Leonard, 31, has been boxing for four years. A social worker studying for her doctorate in public administration, Leonard says she first considered boxing after an especially awful day at work. "I wanted to hit something," she says with a smile.
</P>




<P>"Mr. Chambers was very open to my being here. Archie (Chambers' son) was my first trainer," says Leonard, who counts "stamina and courage" as her strengths but "needs to work on basics."</P>





<P>Chambers points in Leonard's direction. "There goes a lot of heart," he says with fatherly pride. If someone had told him 30 years ago that he would someday coach women like Leonard and Brasher, Chambers would have laughed--or nailed 'em with a killer combination. He knew hunger and heart when he saw it, however, and he welcomed the women into the male-dominated world.</P>





<P>"My ideal fighter is about 6'3", 195 pounds. He's tall, lean, has a good jab, fast hands," Chambers says, knowing all the time his portrait is of a man. "You're born with fast hands. You can't develop fast hands. You can develop quickness, not speed. Reflex is so important."</P>





<P>Chambers speaks kindly of former heavyweight champ Ken Norton, the muscular ex-Marine who shared the title briefly in 1978. But Norton's powerful physique worked against him, "because, if anything, muscles slow you up. Women have an advantage there. If you watch women, many of them have quicker hand speed than men."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR><BR><BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=5>I</FONT>t turns out becoming a professional beer taster requires more than the ability to do one-handed keg stands. But, remember, this is America. Talented folks are being discovered all the time. Hell, you don't even need talent, you just need luck. Two words to prove my point: Tori Spelling. When you consider the cosmic imbalance that had to occur for that career to exist, your odds of becoming the first "discovered" beer taster seem more than favorable. But when the opportunity arises, you'll need to impress breweries with more than your uncanny ability to beer-gargle the theme to <I>Three's Company</I>.</P>

<P>So take a gander at this little crash course on beer tasting. This should not take the place of formal education, of course, but it might convince people you drink beer for reasons other than getting stinking drunk. It may even fool people into thinking you're an intellectual.</P>





<B><P>Color</P></B>





<P>Most of us don't pay attention to this detail--a pitfall of drinking directly out of cans and/or brown bags. But if you want to win friends and influence people, you'll need to incorporate this into your drinking repertoire. You can usually predict how a beer will taste by its color. And if you have even one active brain cell left, this part is cake:</P>


	


<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="beermug.jpeg"><BR>
<BR>

A light-colored beer usually means a light, malty flavor.</P><BR>







<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="beermug3.jpeg"><BR>
<BR>

A dark beer will smell stronger and the malt taste will be more 	pronounced.</P><BR>







<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="beermug2.jpeg"><BR>
<BR>

An amber color indicates a taste somewhere between these two.</P><BR><BR>




<BR>
<BR>




<B><P>Aroma
</P></B>




<P>This requires some theatrics. If you do it well, it's sure to make men applaud and women swoon. If you're comparing several beers, choose the lightest color first. To achieve the proper sniffage, swirl the glass (gently) to release the aroma and sniff. (Plunging your nose directly into the beverage is not recommended.) Then, of course, give your interpretation of what you're smelling. However, you'll need some vocab besides the words "neat-o," "peeww" and "smells like gym socks." Here are a few words to help:</P>




<UL>
<LI>Sulfidy: yeasty
<LI>Estery: fruity 
<LI>Grainy: starchy, smells like grain 
<LI>Sour: (c'mon)
<LI>Bouquet: the overall aroma of the beer
</UL>



<B><P>Taste</P></B>





<P>You may think you've got this part down, but it's not as simple as it sounds. Most of us slide beer past our tongue so quickly, we're only left with an aftertaste to guide us. And while the aftertaste is certainly important, you need to reacquaint yourself with your tongue and its many glorious functions to fully experience beer.</P>





<P>Think back to the days of health class film strips. Remember those diagrams of the tongue? If you do, you know that different regions of the tongue taste different qualities. The tip of the tongue tastes sweetness/bitterness. The middle of the tongue tastes saltiness. And the back of the tongue registers those aftertastes we know and love.</P>





<P>After you're comfortable with the intricate workings of your tongue, you're ready to taste beer. Take a drink and hold it in your mouth for a moment. Concentrate on how the beer tastes on each part of your tongue. Once you've isolated the beer's qualities, you can talk about each of them and how you feel they affect the overall taste of the beer. 
</P>




<P>A truly talented beer taster should know what ingredients and techniques produce each of these characteristics. That kind of information is a little too complicated for the likes of this article, so until you get a chance to study, you can make use of this gross, yet informative, oversimplification: The two main characteristics of beer are sweetness and bitterness. Sweetness is a result of malt and bitterness is a result of hops.</P>







<P><B>A note on aftertaste</B></P>







<P>This is often misunderstood. The dogmas of societal beverage consumption teach us that anything with an aftertaste is swill and should be labeled as such by means of an exaggerated grimace. But aftertaste in beer is both important and desirable. It is the aftertaste that provides the most information about the type and style of beer you're tasting. So don't dog the aftertaste. Aftertaste is your friend.</P>





<B><P>But wait, there's more!</P></B>





<P>The information you've read here is just the tip of the brewing iceberg. If you plan on breaking into the fast-paced, glamorous world of beer tasting, you need to further your education. There are several sites on the web that contain great information, or you could call up a friend and ask them for directions to your local library. Despite the fact that they don't serve beer, they do have information about it. And by all means, practice, practice, practice! </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>"W</FONT>e're going ballistic, Mav!" screamed Anthony Edwards in Top Gun, the movie that made tens of thousands of people want to climb into an F-14 and tear through the sky. </P>





<P>"Most people start in a Cessna 152," says flight instructor Mikel May. This small, lightweight plane with its wings strapped to the roof and its propeller dutifully pulling passengers through the air, is reminiscent of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. But that's where you start if you want to learn to fly.</P>





<P>"The first time you take a lesson, you'll go up in the air," says May. At some point during the flight, the hard-plastic, u-shaped controls to the airplane are handed over to you. Along with the combined fear and exhilaration, you'll experience the pulling, bouncing and gnawing vibrations of a plane that has no first-class section. But you'll have control.</P>





<P>It's your introductory flight, the initial step to getting a private pilot's license, and the wind roars as it rushes past the thin metal doors. The unexpected bump and jolt as the little plane chops it way into the sky sharpens your senses, unlike the numbness you passively receive in a massive airliner. </P>


<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="plane1.jpeg">


<P>You're in control as the ground shrinks beneath you and the sky opens up. When you take the controls, you're absorbing each sensation, additional knowledge for a license that will allow you to rent or own an airplane and fly by yourself in good weather, day or night. You'll be able to take passengers, but you can't be hired as a pilot.</P>





<P>The path you'll follow to your license follows strict guidelines set by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>


<UL>
<LI>Complete a minimum of 40 hours of flight time of which 20 hours are solo and 20 hours you'll have an instructor by your side.

<LI>Pass the private pilot written, oral and flight test.

<LI>Be at least 17 years old.

<LI>Pass a third class medical examination.
</UL>



<P>"With each lesson you'll fly," says May. "The instructor is there to correct the student's mistakes." Although correcting your mistakes may take more than 40 hours of instruction.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>R</FONT>unway modeling career not taking off like you'd hoped? Don't worry. There are other ways to make money in the fashion industry, and Farley Enterprises is one of them. The folks at Farley Enterprises buy and sell vintage clothing. More specifically, they buy vintage American clothing and sell it to vintage retailers in Japan.</P>

  
	

<P>Many of us here in the States buy vintage clothes because we get all the style and pizzazz of the Ropers for the price of a can of cocktail weenies. So you're probably wondering how selling <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="disco.gif">your clothes to a middle man, who exports it overseas to a retailer, is going to land you more than a couple nickels and a Skee-Ball token. Well, lucky for you, the Japanese are pretty serious about their vintage wardrobe.</P>


	

<P>According to Kurt Jensen, operations manager at Farley Enterprises, collecting vintage clothing is more than a fashion statement to the Japanese--it's a hobby. "They study and identify vintage clothes, especially jeans. Many of them can look at a jean and date it. To them, in a lot of ways, vintage clothes are a status symbol," says Jensen.</P>


	

<P>This means there are Japanese out there who are willing to pay serious cash for your hand-me-downs. But you have to have the right stuff. Farley Enterprises is a serious business and they need to satisfy the needs of their customers. For all of you who were hoping to make a quick buck on your third grade Hee-Haw culottes and your lavender legwarmers, you'll need to start planning a garage sale.</P>

 
	

<P>"Some people don't understand why I won't take their vintage clothing items. But I can't sell a retailer stuff that won't sell in his store. That's why we ask for very specific items--items that we know will sell," says Jensen.</P>

 
	

<P>The Japanese are primarily interested in clothing from the '40s to the '70s. But vintage denim is the treasure of choice--especially Wrangler, Lee and Levis. And if they're in good condition, you may be entitled to yen-o-plenty. For example, a pair of Levi's "red lines" in good condition could land you a hundred bucks. There are other gems to be had as well, like vintage Nike shoes, simple print college tees, Windbreakers and military and letterman jackets to name a few.  And for the lucky soul who saved a pair of first edition Air Jordans, you could be $200 richer. If you have a specialty item, you may be able to submit it to the vintage auction where your swank threads go to the highest bidder. (Some couple received a bid of $25,000 for a pair of 1927 vintage Levis in one of these auctions.)</P>


	 

<P>Wondering if you might have some worthy vintage duds? See for yourself on their website. There you'll get valuable information about the ebb and flow of the vintage market. You'll also find a description of their vintage reference guide, <I>Wanted in Japan</I>. According to Jensen, you shouldn't sell so much as a jelly bracelet without this bible of the previously owned.</P>


	 

<P>"<I>Wanted in Japan</I>  is kind of a training manual. It comes out once a year and contains basic vintage information. And it's good no matter who you're selling to. So if you're going to (sell vintage clothing), you'd better have our reference book. If you don't, you'll be at a loss," says Jensen.</P>

 
	

<P>Even if you are at a loss and have never sold a vintage item in your life, you can rest assured that when you deal with Farley Enterprises, you're dealing with honest people. "We have a lot of pride and integrity in our business." says Jensen. "We have no hidden agendas and we're very open with our information. So call right away. I need this stuff."</P>

<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Bill Thornbro</A></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>MIAMI</FONT> -- Because the US trade embargo against Cuba is more than 30 years old, a whole generation of smokers in this town have never puffed a good Cuban cigar. They praise the quality and character of cigars they've never tasted.</P>

<P>Laws don't stop smokers from dreaming of forbidden cheroots. Absence makes the heart and lungs grow fonder, it's true. Smuggling is a lucrative enterprise, and somebody always knows somebody who knows somebody, making a box of El Rey del Mundo coronas, while very expensive, a couple of connections away. And there are people in the states who don't mind paying ridiculous bucks for smuggled stogies; the contraband is as much a status symbol as the BMW or Mercedes in the driveway.</P>

<P>That's good news to the profiteers. The thriving black market even includes cigar counterfeiters, a major problem say experts. So while a number of Americans are cheering Cuba's creeping capitalism, there is a dark segment wishing Fidel <IMG WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=56 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="cigar1.gif"> Castro a long and happy life. Their illegal franchise depends on it.</P>

<P>The cigar is a peculiar thing to ponder at a time when cigarette popularity is plummeting. The government's war on tobacco -- and, to be honest, on smokers too -- is white hot. American tobacco companies are under fire, and smokers are treated like Montana militia members should they dare light one up in public.</P>

<P>Curiously, cigar smoking has recently achieved a glamour heretofore unknown. There was a time when the image of the cigar smoker came in two flavors: the fat, heartless Wall Street tycoon or the bewhiskered, often drunk hobo. But the attitude toward affluence changed in the Reagan decade, and younger, sexier celebrities embraced cigar smoking. David Letterman smoked 'em. Jack Nicholson enjoyed a good one. Even supermodels Lauren Hutton and Linda Evangelista appreciate what once was an exclusively masculine habit. Some smart entrepreneur eventually published a slick, classy magazine devoted to cigars and fine living, the oversized Cigar Aficionado. This was acceptance by any standards. Sentiment had shifted. Cigars were hot.</P>

<P>We're not talking about some foul rope and rank wrapper. What America most certainly does not need is a nickel cigar. But timing and luck and some good PR combined to again make fine cigars part of a gentleman's civilized evening.</P>

in half. This will give you four smaller pieces. Set aside for the
moment.</P>





<P>2. Combine the honey and the mustard. Generously baste the chicken with
the mixture and set aside again. This step may be done the night before in
order to let the chicken marinate in the sauce, but make sure to put it in
the refrigerator for the night.</P>





<P>3. Once the grill is hot enough, put the chicken on and cover the grill.
Keep a close eye on the chicken...you want to cook it, not burn it.</P>





<P>4. Fill a pot with enough water to generously cover the potatoes when they
are in it. Put the pot on the burner and leave to boil. When the water
boils, turn the heat down to simmer and cook the potatoes until they are
tender when poked with a fork. Drain and set aside to cool for the moment.</P>





<P>5. While the potatoes are cooking, look in on the chicken and flip it over.
You may want to baste it again with the honey and mustard, but make up a
new batch. The first batch may have bacteria in it from the raw chicken,
so make sure to also clean the basting brush. Cover again.</P>





<P>6. While the potatoes are boiling, slice the zucchini very thin and place
into a skillet with the butter, salt, and pepper. Cook on medium heat
until the zucchini are tender, but not soggy.  Remove from the heat.</P>





<P>7. Once the potatoes are cool enough to touch, cut each into fourths and
put into a bowl. Toss in 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt and the butter
indicated. Set aside.</P>





<P>8. By now the chicken should be done (the juices should run clear when cut).
 Remove
from the grill. Now everything is ready to serve. If the
zucchini is cool, place on the burner long enough to heat, and if the
potatoes are cool, put in the microwave long enough to warm. Serve
according to your appetite.</P>

<B><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><P>Candlelight Dinner of Burgundy Beef Tips, <BR>
Honey Glazed Carrots, Seasoned Rice,
 and dessert  <I>(perhaps a <A HREF="des1.html">Baked Apple</A>)</I>
</P></H3></B>

<P>Have you ever wanted to be romantic on short notice, and all that's in the refrigerator is beer, salsa, and chicken salad?  It's difficult, when you live alone, to be frugal with your money, but at the same time be elegant.  I have devised a menu that provides romance with easy steps, a small amount of time, and little money.  Get ready for a menu that will enhance a romantic evening!</P>



<BR>







<B>

<P>8-10 oz. of beef sirloin tips (you will probably have to buy beef sirloin 	and have the butcher cut it into pieces for you)</P>




<P>Burgundy wine or other dry red wine</P>




<P>1 red pepper</P>




<P>1 green pepper</P>




<P>1 small onion (I suggest vidalia or a white onion)</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of butter</P>




<P>1 small package of baby carrots</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of honey
White rice (enough for two people)
1 beef boullion cube</P>



<BR>
<BR>



<P>Directions</P></B>




<P>1. Cut the peppers into thin strips and discard the seeds.  Then cut the onion into thin rings.  Place enough of each for two people into a skillet with the butter.  Saute' until the veggies are hot and partially cooked, but still a bit crisp (about five minutes).  Set aside.</P>




<P>2. Heat a skillet or wok on high heat and add the beef tips.  Cook briefly on all sides to brown (this seals in the juices).  Turn the heat to medium, then add 1/4 -1/2 cup of the burgundy wine and continue to cook until the beef is no longer pink in the center.</P>




<P>3. While the beef is cooking, follow the directions for the rice and get that started.  Add the boullion to the water according to the instructions.  This will flavor the rice quite nicely.  </P>






<P>4. Go back to the beef tips while the rice is doing its thing.  Add the sauteed veggies to the tips, season to taste with salt and pepper, and turn the heat to low.</P>





<P>5. Check the rice before you move to the carrots.</P>






<P>6. The fastest and easiest way to cook these carrots is going to be in the microwave.  Put the carrots, about a teaspoon of water, and a dash of salt into a microwave safe container.  Cover with plastic wrap, place in the microwave, and cook on high for about three minutes.  After this time, poke them with a fork to test them.  They are done whenever they are as tender as you like.  Drain off the water, and add the honey.  Place the plastic wrap back over the bowl and place back inside the microwave (do not turn it on...this just provides a place to keep the carrots warm).</P>




<P>7. Check the rice.  Check the beef tips.  If everything is hot and done, you are ready to plate it up and eat it.  **If the sauce with the beef tips seems too runny, take about 1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon of cornstarch, mix it with a bit of cold water (to form a paste), and stir it into the beef tip mix.  This will thicken the sauce.  Continue to cook just a few minutes longer, and then serve.</P>



<P>Bon Appetit!</P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>-P</FONT>ut a quarter of a vanilla bean into the bottom of a ten-cup coffee pot
before the coffee is brewed. The bean will steep in the coffee and
take on a wonderful flavor. Try serving with whipped cream and vanilla
sugar.*</P>




<P>- Place a cinnamon stick in the bottom of a ten-cup coffee pot. Follow the
directions above.</P>




<P>- Fill a coffee mug half full with coffee and then add one tablespoon of
chocolate syrup. Top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cocoa.</P>




<P>- Use vanilla sugar or honey to sweeten your coffee.</P>




<P>- Present your guests first with their own cups of coffee, and then place a
saucer of hard candies on the table that they can drop into their coffee to
sweeten and flavor it. Good flavors to try are butterscotch, cinnamon,
peppermint, caramel, anise, vanilla, amaretto (Brachs makes a line of
International Toffees that would be excellent for this purpose).</P>





<P>For those who don't like coffee, the same ideas can be applied to hot
chocolate. This idea goes over well with youngsters.</P>





<P>*Vanilla sugar is made by burying a piece of vanilla bean in a cup or two
of sugar.  Seal both in a jar and allow to sit for a few days. Shake every
now and then to disperse the flavor.  Taste it to determine the intensity
of the vanilla flavor and use as desired.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Berry Wonderful Salad</H2>
<BR><BR>





<P><FONT SIZE=4>A</FONT>lthough it is not as common to see fresh fruit as an end to a French meal, it will pop up occasionally, especially when the weather is hot and something light is in order. This also makes a wonderful snack.</P>








<P><B>1 pint of good raspberries</B></P>





<P><B>1 pint of blueberries</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 pound of cherries-halved (Bing cherries are wonderful)</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 pound of strawberries-sliced thin</B></P>





<P><B>Honey</B></P>





<P><B>Heavy whipping cream</B></P>


<BR>
<BR>



<P><B>Directions:</B></P>





<P>1. Make sure that all of the fruit is clean before starting. Carefully wash the berries in cold water and pat dry with a clean towel.</P>





<P>2. Leave the raspberries and the blueberries whole. Remove the seeds from the cherries and then cut each in half. Remove the tops of the strawberries (be careful not to remove too much of the berry) and then slice them thin.</P>





<P>3.  Put all of the berries into a bowl and gently mix together.</P>

  



<P>4. If the berries are a bit tart, sprinkle with a bit of sugar and mix again. Be careful not to use too much sugar. You want to be able to taste the berry, not the sugar.</P>





<P>5. Pour about 1 cup of the whipping cream into a mixing bowl and begin to mix on low speed of an electric mixer (a wire whisk can be used, but beware that it is hard on the arm muscles). When it JUST starts to thicken a bit, add about one tablespoon of honey and continues to beat. You do not want the cream to get chunky, just smooth so that when you pull the beaters out of the mixture, it gently sticks to the beaters. Even if it is a bit runny, that's okay. Now taste it to make sure that it's sweet enough. If not, add a bit more honey and mix just long enough to incorporate. Cover and refrigerate.</P>





<P>If you're not ambitious enough to make your own whipped cream, either buy some or simply serve the berries sprinkled in honey. </P>

 



<P>To serve, put a small portion of berries into a dessert dish and carefully place whipped cream on top. Garnish with fresh mint if desired.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Chocolate Carmel Pecan Ice Cream Pie
</H2><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Here's a dessert that is perfect for company or just to enjoy all by yourself.  And guess what? It is sooooo easy!

<B>

<P>1 pre-made pie shell (graham or cookie)</P>





<P>1 quart vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt</P>





<P>1 small package chocolate chips</P>



<P>1  small package pecan pieces</P>





<P>1 jar carmel ice cream topping </P>

</B>
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Directions</B>



<P>1. Pull ice cream out of the freezer and allow to thaw on the counter for about 1/2 hour.</P>





<P>2. Open the pie shell, but leave it in the foil tin.</P>





<P>3. Melt 1/2 cup of chocolate chips over a hot-water bath or in the microwave.  </P>





<P>4. Spread the chocolate evenly over the bottom of the pie crust.  Put it in the refrigerator to harden the chocolate.
</P>




<P>5. Spread the ice cream into the pie shell (on top of the chocolate).  Use only enough to almost reach the top edge of the shell.</P>

 



<P>6. Pour the carmel over the ice cream and smooth.  You probably won't need all the topping.</P>





<P>7. Sprinkle the pecans on top.  You could also sprinkle chocolate chips on if you want.  Freeze for two hours.</P>





<P>To serve, use a warm, wet knife to slice through the pie.  Garnish with whipped cream and serve.</P>



<B>*</B>Hot chocolate or flavored coffee goes well with this.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Baked Apples</H2>

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P>This old favorite is a deceptively simple recipe. It makes a sweet, enticing desert, or a spicey treat any afternoon.</P>







<P>1.	Take your favorite apple, core it and peel the top half. 
</P>




<P>2.	Place in a oven-safe container just large enough to hold the apple.
</P>




<P>3.	Fill the center with 1 teaspoon of butter or margarine, 1 teaspoon<BR>
 brown sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon.
</P>




<P>4. 	Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Put apple in oven for 10 minutes. 
	Then baste the apple with the syrup in the bottom of the dish. </P>

	

<P>Bake for 10 more minutes.</P>







<P>5.	Repeat process until apple is tender when poked with a fork.</P>





<P>6.	Remove from oven carefully. Sprinkle more brown sugar if
 	desired.</P>


<P>Variations on a theme<BR>


Replace brown sugar with honey or omit the brown sugar and<BR>
 	cinnamon and fill the center with "red hot" candies.</P></B>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Healthy Eating--French Style</H2>
<BR>
<BR>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>W</FONT>hether you are trying your hand at classical French fare or are simply trying to keep the hot side hot and the cold side cold, here are a few ways to lighten your food and get you on the road to healthier eating and a happier life.</P>





<P>1. Try using non-stick pans to reduce the amount of oil or fat needed to cook with.</P>





<P>2. Saut&eacute; vegetables in water or a spritz of cooking spray instead of oil or butter. Season with herbs and spices.</P>





<P>3. Use lower-fat or no-fat ingredients when possible.</P>





<P>4. Ste am your vegetables whenever possible--this not only keeps them crisper, but they retain a lot more nutrients this way.</P>





<P>5. One cup of beans adds flavor and fiber, not to mention protein, to soups, stews and salads.</P>





<P>6. When a recipe calls for salt, either reduce the amount by half, or omit it all together and season with herbs. This lowers sodium in the diet.</P>





<P>7. If a recipe calls for whole eggs, try replacing 2 egg whites for every 1 whole egg. This lowers fat in the recipe (1 yolk has about 4 grams of fat) and cholesterol. </P>





<P>8. After cooking ground beef, place it in a strainer and rinse it with hot water to remove excess fat and grease.</P>





<P>9. When a recipe calls for butter, reduce the amount by a third and see what the result. You may be surprised. (This does not always work in baked products)</P>





<P>10. Substitute lean ground turkey or chicken for regular ground beef when possible.</P>





<P>There are many other ways to make a healthier you, but this will hopefully head you in the right direction.  Good Luck.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Your First Kitchen</H2>
<BR>
<BR>



<BLOCKQUOTE><P>As graduation approaches, we are all faced with the big questions.  How do I survive on my own?  What do I do?  What do I need?  Do I have what it takes to keep my underwear from turning pink in the washer?   Despite how huge the real world seems, it is possible to pull it into perspective.  Assuming your mother has helped you along until now, here is just a little more motherly advice to get you going. </P>

 



<P>The new apartment tenant must have a few things to survive in the kitchen.  Some people need more than others, but even if all you do is eat hot dogs and frozen dinners, I think the following will still apply.</P>





<P>The Absolutely Must-Have Kitchen Stuff</P>





<UL>
<LI> A small microwave (great for those frozen dinners and leftovers)
<LI>A paring knife and a chef knife (see the article in the May issue of ENTER)
<LI>Simple dishes (plates and bowls are a must; saucers and gravy boats are not)
<LI>Silverware (go for about 4 sets of knife, fork, spoon if you live alone)
<LI>Glasses (pickle and jelly jars work well here)
<LI> Basic spices (salt, pepper, cinnamon, etc.)
<LI> A sponge and dish soap (Do NOT use regular dish soap in dishwasher.  Use dishwasher soap, otherwise, you will be cleaning up suds for a long time.)
<LI> Plastic storage containers for leftovers (try Cool Whip containers and butter tubs)
<LI>One skillet and one saucepan (try to get a non-stick skillet)
<LI> A small four cup coffeepot (these also can make tea)
<LI> Dish towels and pot holders
<LI> Spoons and spatulas
</UL>




<P>As you get into your kitchen, you will probably want more than just these items, but these are the essentials.  Just think: if cavemen survived with sticks and rocks, you can survive with these simple basics.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Black Peppercorn Steak</H2>				

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT> have returned from France and have some wonderful things for you. 
I've modified some French recipes to fit your lifestyle. Using healthier cooking methods and altering the ingredients a bit, I have brought to you French Cuisine ... almost.</P>








<P><B>3 tablespoons of black peppercorns (or combine black, pink and white)</B></P>





<P><B>4 or 5 steaks of choice, cut to about 3/4 of an inch</B></P>





<P><B>Non-stick cooking spray (butter flavored if possible)</B></P>





<P><B>Salt</B></P>




<P><B>1/2 cup of alcohol (brandy, cognac, wine)</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 to 1 cup of heavy whipping cream</B></P>





<P><B>1 onion</B></P>

<BR>
<BR>




<P><B>Directions:</B></P>





<P>1. Using a hammer or the back side of a pan, crush the peppercorns. Do this just before use to preserve the flavor.</P>





<P>2. Divide the peppercorns evenly between the steaks and press firmly into the flesh. The steaks may be refrigerated overnight this way to infuse flavor.</P>





<P>3. Spray the pan generously with the cooking spray.</P>





<P>4. Add the steaks and onion to the pan and saut&eacute until brown on the first side.  Flip the steak over and repeat. Season with salt and continue to cook until done as desired.</P>





<P>5. Remove steaks and onion rings from the pan and carefully pour off the juices and discard. Place the steaks and onions back in the pan.</P>





<P>6. Return the pan to the burner and add the alcohol and flambe, if desired.*</P>

 



<P>7. Add the cream to the pan and simmer for about five minutes, stirring occasionally.  If the onions are not yet done, remove the steaks from the pan and continue to cook.</P>






<P><B>Serving suggestions:</B></P>





<P>Candied yams, baked potato, caramelized onions, salad</P>





<P>*Flambe means to light the alcohol. This will leave the flavor of the liquid, but remove the alcohol from it. Read up or ask a pro before trying this.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Summer Vegetable Salad</H2>				

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>H</FONT>ere's another French recipe modified for healthier eating. This one would be wonderful on a summer picnic or a family pitch-in.</P>








<P><B>1 cup of diced carrots</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of diced celery</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of shelled peas or lima beans</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of green beans</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of yellow pepper</B></P>





<P><B>4 or 5 tablespoons of red or white wine vinegar salad dressing (low-fat or fat-free is best)</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 cup of low-fat or fat-free mayonnaise (Miracle Whip works too)
salt and pepper, if desired</B></P>


<BR>
<BR>



<P><B>Directions:</B></P>





<P>1. Dice the carrots and celery into pieces the size of peas. Shell the peas and discard the shells--unless you want to nibble on them while you are preparing the salad.  Next, break off the head and tail of the beans and break each into 1/2-inch pieces. Peel the pepper, if desired, discard the seeds, and cut into pieces the size of peas.</P>





<P>2. Put the carrot and the celery in cold, salted (about 1/4 teaspoon) water and bring to a boil. Simmer for about 10 minutes or until tender when poked with a fork. Drain and set aside.</P>





<P>3. Boil the peas and green beans in salted (about 1/4 teaspoon) water for about 6 minutes or until they are just tender when poked with a fork. Drain and immediately put them into a tub of cold water (this stops the cooking).  Then drain and set aside.</P>





<P>4. Mix all the vegetables in one bowl with the salad dressing. Set aside to cool before adding the mayonnaise.</P>





<P>5. Stir in just enough of the mayonnaise to lightly bind the salad together.
Refrigerate. The flavor improves as the salad marinates, so make at least 6 hours in advance.</P>





<P>Any number of vegetables can be used according to your taste. Try some of these: beets, potatoes, leeks, turnips, pearl onions, red pepper, green pepper. The object is to keep the salad colorful.</P>

The hot pepper oil floats on the water, spreads to other parts of your mouth and throat and intensifies the problem. The best thing to do is to eat bread. The bread absorbs the oil.

<B><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><P>Candlelight Dinner of Burgundy Beef Tips, <BR>
Honey Glazed Carrots, Seasoned Rice,
 and dessert  <I>(perhaps a <A HREF="des1.html">Baked Apple</A>)</I>
</P></H3></B>

<P>Have you ever wanted to be romantic on short notice, and all that's in the refrigerator is beer, salsa, and chicken salad?  It's difficult, when you live alone, to be frugal with your money, but at the same time be elegant.  I have devised a menu that provides romance with easy steps, a small amount of time, and little money.  Get ready for a menu that will enhance a romantic evening!</P>



<BR>







<B>

<P>8-10 oz. of beef sirloin tips (you will probably have to buy beef sirloin 	and have the butcher cut it into pieces for you)</P>




<P>Burgundy wine or other dry red wine</P>




<P>1 red pepper</P>




<P>1 green pepper</P>




<P>1 small onion (I suggest vidalia or a white onion)</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of butter</P>




<P>1 small package of baby carrots</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of honey
White rice (enough for two people)
1 beef boullion cube</P>



<BR>
<BR>



<P>Directions</P></B>




<P>1. Cut the peppers into thin strips and discard the seeds.  Then cut the onion into thin rings.  Place enough of each for two people into a skillet with the butter.  Saute' until the veggies are hot and partially cooked, but still a bit crisp (about five minutes).  Set aside.</P>




<P>2. Heat a skillet or wok on high heat and add the beef tips.  Cook briefly on all sides to brown (this seals in the juices).  Turn the heat to medium, then add 1/4 -1/2 cup of the burgundy wine and continue to cook until the beef is no longer pink in the center.</P>




<P>3. While the beef is cooking, follow the directions for the rice and get that started.  Add the boullion to the water according to the instructions.  This will flavor the rice quite nicely.  </P>






<P>4. Go back to the beef tips while the rice is doing its thing.  Add the sauteed veggies to the tips, season to taste with salt and pepper, and turn the heat to low.</P>





<P>5. Check the rice before you move to the carrots.</P>






<P>6. The fastest and easiest way to cook these carrots is going to be in the microwave.  Put the carrots, about a teaspoon of water, and a dash of salt into a microwave safe container.  Cover with plastic wrap, place in the microwave, and cook on high for about three minutes.  After this time, poke them with a fork to test them.  They are done whenever they are as tender as you like.  Drain off the water, and add the honey.  Place the plastic wrap back over the bowl and place back inside the microwave (do not turn it on...this just provides a place to keep the carrots warm).</P>




<P>7. Check the rice.  Check the beef tips.  If everything is hot and done, you are ready to plate it up and eat it.  **If the sauce with the beef tips seems too runny, take about 1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon of cornstarch, mix it with a bit of cold water (to form a paste), and stir it into the beef tip mix.  This will thicken the sauce.  Continue to cook just a few minutes longer, and then serve.</P>



<P>Bon Appetit!</P></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Berry Wonderful Salad</H2>
<BR><BR>





<P><FONT SIZE=4>A</FONT>lthough it is not as common to see fresh fruit as an end to a French meal, it will pop up occasionally, especially when the weather is hot and something light is in order. This also makes a wonderful snack.</P>








<P><B>1 pint of good raspberries</B></P>





<P><B>1 pint of blueberries</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 pound of cherries-halved (Bing cherries are wonderful)</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 pound of strawberries-sliced thin</B></P>





<P><B>Honey</B></P>





<P><B>Heavy whipping cream</B></P>


<BR>
<BR>



<P><B>Directions:</B></P>





<P>1. Make sure that all of the fruit is clean before starting. Carefully wash the berries in cold water and pat dry with a clean towel.</P>





<P>2. Leave the raspberries and the blueberries whole. Remove the seeds from the cherries and then cut each in half. Remove the tops of the strawberries (be careful not to remove too much of the berry) and then slice them thin.</P>





<P>3.  Put all of the berries into a bowl and gently mix together.</P>

  



<P>4. If the berries are a bit tart, sprinkle with a bit of sugar and mix again. Be careful not to use too much sugar. You want to be able to taste the berry, not the sugar.</P>





<P>5. Pour about 1 cup of the whipping cream into a mixing bowl and begin to mix on low speed of an electric mixer (a wire whisk can be used, but beware that it is hard on the arm muscles). When it JUST starts to thicken a bit, add about one tablespoon of honey and continues to beat. You do not want the cream to get chunky, just smooth so that when you pull the beaters out of the mixture, it gently sticks to the beaters. Even if it is a bit runny, that's okay. Now taste it to make sure that it's sweet enough. If not, add a bit more honey and mix just long enough to incorporate. Cover and refrigerate.</P>





<P>If you're not ambitious enough to make your own whipped cream, either buy some or simply serve the berries sprinkled in honey. </P>

 



<P>To serve, put a small portion of berries into a dessert dish and carefully place whipped cream on top. Garnish with fresh mint if desired.</P>

<P><B>Directions:</B></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Chocolate Carmel Pecan Ice Cream Pie
</H2><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Here's a dessert that is perfect for company or just to enjoy all by yourself.  And guess what? It is sooooo easy!

<B>

<P>1 pre-made pie shell (graham or cookie)</P>





<P>1 quart vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt</P>





<P>1 small package chocolate chips</P>



<P>1  small package pecan pieces</P>





<P>1 jar carmel ice cream topping </P>

</B>
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Directions</B>



<P>1. Pull ice cream out of the freezer and allow to thaw on the counter for about 1/2 hour.</P>





<P>2. Open the pie shell, but leave it in the foil tin.</P>





<P>3. Melt 1/2 cup of chocolate chips over a hot-water bath or in the microwave.  </P>





<P>4. Spread the chocolate evenly over the bottom of the pie crust.  Put it in the refrigerator to harden the chocolate.
</P>




<P>5. Spread the ice cream into the pie shell (on top of the chocolate).  Use only enough to almost reach the top edge of the shell.</P>

 



<P>6. Pour the carmel over the ice cream and smooth.  You probably won't need all the topping.</P>





<P>7. Sprinkle the pecans on top.  You could also sprinkle chocolate chips on if you want.  Freeze for two hours.</P>





<P>To serve, use a warm, wet knife to slice through the pie.  Garnish with whipped cream and serve.</P>



<B>*</B>Hot chocolate or flavored coffee goes well with this.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Baked Apples</H2>

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P>This old favorite is a deceptively simple recipe. It makes a sweet, enticing desert, or a spicey treat any afternoon.</P>







<P>1.	Take your favorite apple, core it and peel the top half. 
</P>




<P>2.	Place in a oven-safe container just large enough to hold the apple.
</P>




<P>3.	Fill the center with 1 teaspoon of butter or margarine, 1 teaspoon<BR>
 brown sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon.
</P>




<P>4. 	Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Put apple in oven for 10 minutes. 
	Then baste the apple with the syrup in the bottom of the dish. </P>

	

<P>Bake for 10 more minutes.</P>







<P>5.	Repeat process until apple is tender when poked with a fork.</P>





<P>6.	Remove from oven carefully. Sprinkle more brown sugar if
 	desired.</P>


<P>Variations on a theme<BR>


Replace brown sugar with honey or omit the brown sugar and<BR>
 	cinnamon and fill the center with "red hot" candies.</P></B>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Healthy Eating--French Style</H2>
<BR>
<BR>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>W</FONT>hether you are trying your hand at classical French fare or are simply trying to keep the hot side hot and the cold side cold, here are a few ways to lighten your food and get you on the road to healthier eating and a happier life.</P>





<P>1. Try using non-stick pans to reduce the amount of oil or fat needed to cook with.</P>





<P>2. Saut&eacute; vegetables in water or a spritz of cooking spray instead of oil or butter. Season with herbs and spices.</P>





<P>3. Use lower-fat or no-fat ingredients when possible.</P>





<P>4. Ste am your vegetables whenever possible--this not only keeps them crisper, but they retain a lot more nutrients this way.</P>





<P>5. One cup of beans adds flavor and fiber, not to mention protein, to soups, stews and salads.</P>





<P>6. When a recipe calls for salt, either reduce the amount by half, or omit it all together and season with herbs. This lowers sodium in the diet.</P>





<P>7. If a recipe calls for whole eggs, try replacing 2 egg whites for every 1 whole egg. This lowers fat in the recipe (1 yolk has about 4 grams of fat) and cholesterol. </P>





<P>8. After cooking ground beef, place it in a strainer and rinse it with hot water to remove excess fat and grease.</P>





<P>9. When a recipe calls for butter, reduce the amount by a third and see what the result. You may be surprised. (This does not always work in baked products)</P>





<P>10. Substitute lean ground turkey or chicken for regular ground beef when possible.</P>





<P>There are many other ways to make a healthier you, but this will hopefully head you in the right direction.  Good Luck.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Your First Kitchen</H2>
<BR>
<BR>



<BLOCKQUOTE><P>As graduation approaches, we are all faced with the big questions.  How do I survive on my own?  What do I do?  What do I need?  Do I have what it takes to keep my underwear from turning pink in the washer?   Despite how huge the real world seems, it is possible to pull it into perspective.  Assuming your mother has helped you along until now, here is just a little more motherly advice to get you going. </P>

 



<P>The new apartment tenant must have a few things to survive in the kitchen.  Some people need more than others, but even if all you do is eat hot dogs and frozen dinners, I think the following will still apply.</P>





<P>The Absolutely Must-Have Kitchen Stuff</P>





<UL>
<LI> A small microwave (great for those frozen dinners and leftovers)
<LI>A paring knife and a chef knife (see the article in the May issue of ENTER)
<LI>Simple dishes (plates and bowls are a must; saucers and gravy boats are not)
<LI>Silverware (go for about 4 sets of knife, fork, spoon if you live alone)
<LI>Glasses (pickle and jelly jars work well here)
<LI> Basic spices (salt, pepper, cinnamon, etc.)
<LI> A sponge and dish soap (Do NOT use regular dish soap in dishwasher.  Use dishwasher soap, otherwise, you will be cleaning up suds for a long time.)
<LI> Plastic storage containers for leftovers (try Cool Whip containers and butter tubs)
<LI>One skillet and one saucepan (try to get a non-stick skillet)
<LI> A small four cup coffeepot (these also can make tea)
<LI> Dish towels and pot holders
<LI> Spoons and spatulas
</UL>




<P>As you get into your kitchen, you will probably want more than just these items, but these are the essentials.  Just think: if cavemen survived with sticks and rocks, you can survive with these simple basics.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Kitchen Basics--Knives</H2>
<BR>
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT>f you are just starting out on your own, chances are you don't have much.  Any little bit of information can be helpful. Unless you are a chef, you probably don't know where to begin when it comes to buying knives.  Knives are essential for cutting, slicing, dicing and chopping. Now, if you plan to live off hot dogs, lunch meat and beer, knives will probably never enter your kitchen--nor will a date--but if you plan to eat well and survive on your own, here are a few tips.</P>





<P>There are many different brands of knives. Some come already boxed ($20-$30) and these are fine. But if you want something a bit more durable--something to last through the years--you will have to spend a bit more money. I'm referring to the knives that are sold individually. Sometimes they are boxed, but most often not. There are usually about a million to choose from, but these are the ones you will need to survive.</P>





<P>The first is the chef knife. This knife generally comes in 10" and 8".  Which size you choose is completely up to you--whatever feels most comfortable. Both knives serve the same purpose. The chef knife is good for slicing vegetables, cutting large portions of raw meat, chopping and dicing. It's one of the most important knives.</P>





<P>The next is the utility. This knife does most things the chef knife does, but is slightly smaller--usually 6" to 8". It's good for pantry work, such as preparing lettuce, fruits and so on. It's also good for carving poultry.</P>





<P>The paring knife--usually about 2" to 3"--is probably the most widely used knife in the home kitchen. It is small, versatile and can be more easily manipulated and maneuvered than the other two. Used mostly for trimming and paring fruits and vegetables, it can also be used as a baking tool for trimming pie doughs and cutting pasta. People find this to be most useful for smaller jobs (cutting strawberries, slicing celery, paring apples).  Because it is so small, it fits comfortably in your hand.</P>

  



<P>Don't let the salespeople talk you into a 17 piece set so they can get their comission. Buy what you want and need. You have to live with what you purchase, not the salesperson.  Keep your mind set and dive right in.</P>





<P>Things to remember when buying knives:</P>




<UL>
<LI>How much can you afford?
<LI>How will you use the knives?
<LI>Spend a little extra for quality--it's better in the long run.
<LI>How long do you want these knives to last?
</UL>



<P>Some of the most popular brands are Chicago Cutlery, Henckles, and Wustoff, although there are many other brands.</P>





<P>Prices range from $10 per knife to over $400 for top of the line. Just remember--whatever feels right. Hold the knife in your hand. If it doesn't feel right, don't buy it. Be sharp and don't get cut. Have fun!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Welcome to ENTER Magazine's Premiere issue!</P>


<P>First, a fable for our time. 
</P>




<P>And so it came to pass that a few creative types discovered entrepreneurism by pioneering the 'Net. They entertained new options, explored new opportunities, and thoroughly confounded their families and friends with constant cybergibberish. It was fun, sure, but it was not without dangers. Publishing of any kind is a risky venture, but you've got to be especially brave or disturbingly stupid to put all your eggs in one on-line basket. To make matters worse, the creators of this magazine decided to distance themselves from the rest of the Internet pack by attributing sources and creating their own material. They would be serious journalists. They wanted to be good.</P>





<P>Who did these people think they were?</P>





<P>First, they drank a lot of coffee and argued and planned. They spent several months just creating the company's infrastructure. They sought financial backing rather than go with ads in the first issue. And they put together a small but dedicated staff with what money they had.</P>





<P>They said their magazine would be styled for people like themselves, young professionals who want to cram a lot of information in 30 minutes of 'Net reading. A lot of stories would be about similar young people on the verge of success. Other stories might be dedicated to saving a buck on a new or used car or fixing a cheap-but-impressive meal for a date. All of the stories would be written well. The stories would be the stars.
</P>




<P>Finally, the fellows decided their magazine would include short sound bites and movie clips, further distancing themselves from the competition.</P>




<P>
Will the guys succeed? Will they be happy ever after? The fable continues next month.         <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG ALT="When"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="when.jpeg">it comes to knowing what you're worth to a company the cards may in fact seem stacked against you. Maybe you've played a game of Go Fish with a potential employer. The game goes like this: "Do you have an ace?" you ask cautiously. "Nope, better luck next time. Go fish," the employer replies. All you find in the mess of cards is deuces. 
</P>




<P>"Job interviews are all a game so you just have to be careful how you play your cards," said Sara Veatch, an associate relations manager, with more than eight years of experience.</P>





<P>To straighten that mess of cards out you must first know how much the position you are interviewing for pays on the job market. Libraries and bookstores are littered with salary guides, but those guides are packed with figures from people with one to three years of experience. 
</P>




<P>Information overload.</P>





<P>One reliable source to find out what your colleagues are being offered fresh out of school is the Salary Survey published quarterly by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE). The guide is located in almost every college career center.

<P>So you've found what may be your next car and it's used. Before you drive into the sunset with the wind blowing through your hair, you need to carefully examine the car first.</P>






<P>We spoke with LemonBusters of Texas and Lemon Aid of Pennsylvania, two professional used car inspection services, about how to inspect a used car for potential signs of wear, tear, and damage. </P>





<P>Before you begin any inspection, make sure that a "Buyer's Guide" is displayed on the car if it is at a dealer. Federal law requires dealers to display the "Buyer's Guide" sticker to give buyers the warranty information. Read it carefully, because in many states the words "as is" declares a denial of warranty coverage, according to Consumer Reports.</P>





<P>If the car is from a private seller, ask for the service records, repair bill, or warranty information. If they look perplexed or can't show any documentation you may want to begin looking elsewhere for a used car.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You only paid four grand for that used car. Great deal. Now you may be looking at a repair bill for several thousand dollars. It's money you don't have and time you can't spare.  That's why you need to know everything that could go wrong before you drive away in what could be an expensive mistake.</P>





<P>Several businesses across the United States are armed with the knowledge and unbiased opinion that will make your used car choice the right one. Two such businesses--LemonBusters, located in Texas, and Lemon Aid in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania--are mobile used car inspection services. Both will travel within their greater metro areas to perform detailed inspections on that shiny, sparkling, sexy, exciting used car. </P>





<P>Don't think you need anything like this? Neither did John Parker.</P>





<P>"I had four good days of carefree driving after I bought my used car." says Parker. "Then on the fifth day I was driving down the road and the entire transmission fell out of the car. No joke. The whole transmission was just lying on the road behind me."</P>





<P>According to Parker the $1,600 he had paid for the car was a great deal at first, but after $1,200 in repairs he could only sell the car for $1,000. </P>





<P>"You have to be careful when you buy a used car because not every state, and that includes Texas, has a lemon law," says Keith Rizzo of LemonBusters.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"You're in debt way over your head."
</P>




<P>But how could they know? Could Dionne Warwick and her psychic friends hold some remarkable power? No.</P>





<P>"Sir, your VISA was just rejected. Do you have another credit card perhaps?" the psychic questioned. </P>





<P>Why yes, you do. Several in fact, but they all appear to be maxed out at the moment.</P>





<P>Could this be you? Grasping for any attempt to straighten out the mess of debt you created in college. For $5.95 a minute psychic hotlines are not your last bastion of hope. You can be your own savior, or at the very least find someone to help you out of the ever-growing hole of debt.</P>





<P><B>Yeah, whatever. What options do    <!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="i.jpeg">have?</B></P>



<P>The first step to ending the debt nightmare is to contact your creditors directly and throw yourself onto their mercy, according to Stephen Rhode, president of
<A HREF="http://www.debt-experts.com/">Debt Counselors of America</A> (800-680-3328), a non-profit credit counseling agency.  </P>





<P>By contacting your creditors you can fend off any calls or stop the ones that may already be coming. Creditors don't enjoy trying to track down their delinquent accounts, and most are willing to work with you to establish a payment plan. But be ready to answer some tough questions about why you haven't been paying. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Welcome to Enter Magazine's May issue!</P>




<P>ENTER Magazine will always be for the college student or recent grad. We want to help you land that great job and make good money. That's why few issues are as important to us as the one you're reading now. </P>





<P>If you're graduating from collge this spring, there are probably a number of important things on your mind, things like parties, parties and, yes, even parties. You might also think about resumes, jobs, cars and apartments. It's all here, pal. Oh, we also have a couple of stories about drinking beer and women's boxing, but that's because all work and no play will make you a vice-presidential candidate.</P>





<P>And we wouldn't want that to happen.</P>





<P>By the way, for the curious few who track such trivia, this magazine was not born in some sterile office environment. No, no. It slowly evolved over several months and hundreds of cold beers at the Nickel Plate Bar & Grill. In fact, we continue to hold a number of story conferences at "our table" at that friendly establishment. It would not be outrageous to credit some of our success to the Nickel Plate's speedy kitchen, swell eats and steady stream of Sam Adams and Honey Brown. Stop by when you're in Fishers, Indiana. Ask Scott the Bartender for the special.</P>





<P>Now, go turn that tassel and tap that keg. </P></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>W</FONT>elcome to Enter Magazine's June issue!</P>






<P>You've come to trust the staff at ENTER to bring you the information you need to improve your lot in life. But do you, dear reader, have any idea what our writers, editors, designers sacrifice?</P>





<P>In order to put together the great story on job interviews, it wasn't unusual for our people to go several minutes without a trip to the vending machines.</P>





<P>Before we could write stories about learning to fly, finding lost people and buying auto insurance, we were forced to conduct several story conferences by the pool. In lawn chairs. Wearing sunglasses. As if that weren't bad enough, the piece on the Nielsen families required watching a lot of TV--mostly sports--while we were forced to survive on a diet of Miller Lite and Doritos.</P>





<P>Man, we're dedicated.</P>





<P>We think our Food Editor has the right idea. Amy's spending a couple of weeks in France. That's right, the country near Paris. Anyway, she promises to bring back all kinds of yummy recipes. As usual, we promise to eat everything she cooks.</P>





<P>Ah, journalism is such hard work.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>W</FONT>elcome to Enter Magazine's July issue!</P>








<P>We're very proud of this issue.</P>


 
 

<P>For starters, it's full of the usual great stuff you expect from ENTER. We'll help you draft an excellent cover letter, walk you through a typical day as a movie extra, baby your car's air conditioning system and introduce you to one of the more noble work alternatives, the Peace Corps. Our recipes will keep your tummy happy. Our commentary will challenge your thinking.</P>


 
 

<P>As proud as we are of the contents, we're just as proud of the magazine itself. ENTER is part of a small group of online publications that try to take the high road. Like our good friends in cyberspace, we don't know the meaning of lowest common denominator. We try to show you the respect you've shown us in your letters, e-mail and calls.</P>


 
 

<P>We've found we can be irreverent and clever and still stay true to our journalism roots. And, although we're prepared to discuss advertising on our pages, we think our readers would appreciate our rejection of some potential suitors.</P>


 


<P>Thank you for reading ENTER. You mean everything to us.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>O</FONT>n March 1, 1996, the Internet changed; a dynamic, take-charge monthly magazine premiered, ENTER. With its unique brand of original content, ease of use and in-depth coverage of life after college, Enter has been hailed as one of the best sites on the Web. USA Today, Microsoft, NetGuide magazine, Global Network Navigator, Hearst New Media, LeadStory.com and <A HREF="/may/thanks/thanks.html">many more</A> agree, "Enter is the safety net when you jump off the college cliff." Internet Underground magazine calls Enter a "priceless resource." More importantly, our readers say they find Enter invaluable and entertaining.</P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>I bought my car, a 1987 Volvo 240 DL station wagon, at the end of the summer preceding my (second) senior year of college. I bought the car partially out of necessity. The car I was driving had too many pizza-delivery miles on it, and due to lousy seals around the rear windows, it was a mobile fishbowl when it rained. Before I poured any more money into it, I thought I'd cut my losses and get the wagon.
</P>




<P>It had around 113,000 miles on when I bought it, and I've put over 50,000 in the last two-plus years. It's been to Key West and back, and on a month-long journey through 15 states throughout the south and west, more than 10,000 miles in under 30 days.</P>





<P>I've changed the oil regularly, and replaced some belts, but the main headache has been the hub caps. Searching for the hub caps for this car should involve Americas Most Wanted. Also, I'm beginning to suspect that under the thin layer of plastic lays some precious metal justifying their cost.
</P>




<P>There are a few miscellaneous noises, and the radio cuts in and out from the passenger-side speakers when I hit one of Indianapolis' "battle zone" potholes, but I still enjoy driving it.
</P>




<P>I have an ultimate goal: I want to roll the odometer over 500,000 miles. When I do, I plan to pull to the side of the road and cut my driver's license in two. From there on, I'll take a bus or ride a bike.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>That's right! ENTER MAGAZINE wants to give you a <B>free</B> oil change if you give us the low down on your high-mileage car!</P>





<P>This is how it works:<BR>




1. The car has to have over 100,000 miles on it and still run.<BR>

2. Write 200 words or less about the car and what it, and you, have been through.<BR>

3. Take at least three pictures; these should include the outside of the car (front, side, or three-quarter angle from the front), and a picture of the odometer to verify the miles.<BR>

4. Send the essay and pictures to:</P>


<P ALIGN=CENTER>
ENTER MAGAZINE<BR>

P.O. Box 501431<BR>

Indianapolis, Indiana<BR>
 
46250-6431<BR></P>




<P>5. Entries must be received by the 20th of each month prior to the month of publication.</P>





<P>The winner will be selected not based on highest miles, but the most interesting story (see <A HREF="glue.html">example</A>) Winners will be notified by the 25th of the month prior to publication and will receive the oil change within two weeks after notification.</P>





<P>ENTER reserves the right to edit material that is received and all entries and material are non-returnable. All entries become the property of ENTER, Inc.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="wine.jpeg" ALIGN=RIGHT><BR><BR><BR>


<P>It's natural to want better things. The human animal is rarely satisfied. That's why, after a few (legal) years of light beer and margarittas at Chi-Chi's, you've decided to graduate to fine wine, one of civilization's oldest and best beverages. Cheers.</P>





<P>A couple of things you should know first:</P>




<P><B>
The rules aren't as complicated as you think.</B> Is it white wine with fish and poultry, red wine with cheeseburgers and pterodactyl? How long does a wine age before it reaches mandatory retirement and draws Social Security? </P>





<P>Some wine sophisticates will scream bloody murder if they catch you sipping a white wine with a steak. Hey, it's your wallet, your palette, your lunch. Drink what you want. You won't go wrong selecting a moderately priced cabernet sauvignon (a red) with red meat or a nice chardonnay (white) with chicken or fish, but don't feel glued to ancient customs.</P>





<P>As for aging, usually the more complex and heavier a wine, the longer it can take to mature. A chardonnay continues to improve for three or four years after being bottled, maintains its peak for a couple more years, and then declines. A medium-bodied red wine can peak and maintain its flavor for six to fifteen years, depending on a variety of factors.</P>





<P><B>There's a good wine for every budget.</B> A 12-year-old bottle of Chateau Arm-and-Leg may be a terrific buy at $250, but a year-old bottle of Yummy, the Wine o' Gods may be an even better deal at $8.50.</P>





<P>If you've read People or watched Entertainment Tonight, you know there are folks who think nothing about dropping three bills on a stupid pair of pants. But you're smart; you shop at The Gap. Well, there are Gap-like liquor stores with knowledgeable clerks who are more than happy to help you select the right bottle of vino. Some liquor stores even have free wine tastings.</P>





<P>Price differences may have nothing to do with quality. For example, some European wines are higher in price in order to cover shipping and distribution charges. </P>





<P><B>There's only one reason to drink wine.</B> Wine should please the senses. You'll impress more people by serving an affordable, great-tasting wine than by serving an over-priced wine that tastes like cough syrup. You value your reputation for honesty, right? Why blow it by pretending to enjoy a wine with all the flavor of a robust windshield wiper fluid (November vintage)?</P>





<P>Take advantage of opportunities to experiment with wines. Try as many wines as your  budget will allow. Sample a Burgundy or Bordeaux. Taste and compare a Chardonnay and a Chablis. The more you try, the more you learn. Later, when you need a wine for an important occasion, you'll think of a wine you will savor and a price you can stomach.        <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<IMG ALT="Y" IMG ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="y.jpeg">eah, you can see yourself in uniform,  a burly member of the feared Mattress Police, that top-secret division of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Box Springs. You'd take a blood oath to uphold the Constitution and to forever preserve the holy image of J. Edgar Hoover--the image we had before we learned the G-Man was a Girlie Man. Maybe you'd get to be a plain-clothes Mattress Dick. You could raid private homes, bust down bedroom doors and violate civil rights willy-nilly (What's a Constitution when you can be featured on Cops?). "Okay," you'd holler, "this is the Mattress Police. You two, stop that coitus right now!" You'd flash your badge so nobody could read it, towering over the probable felons like a California redwood. Then you'd wave your government-issue Uzi in their direction and scream: "Look, which one of you scumbags took off the TAG?"</P>

<!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="matt.jpeg">



<P>Only one problem, officer. There is no Mattress Police. The feds don't care if you remove the tag on your mattress. "The tag" is a requirement of individual state boards of health, not Janet Reno & Co. According to one bedding manufacturer, states require each company to attach a tag that lists the contents (goose down, polyester fibers, etc.) of new pillows and mattresses. "Each ingredient is listed on the tag," a manufacturer said, "along with a number issued to the company by the state.</P>





<P>But what about the famous warning, DO NOT REMOVE UNDER PENALTY OF LAW? "If you read it again you'll notice it says 'not to be removed except by the consumer,'" said another manufacturer, one who has heard this dumb story too many times over the years to be amused. "A lot of comedians tell the joke, but it's really not that funny."        <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Any chimp can review new movies (and some clearly do). But when all the new releases have been checked out, you need a fearless reviewer who'll suggest a video alternative, something old and overlooked. This month:</P>





<P>Oliver Stone's Nixon isn't half as good as the worst PBS documentary, fueling speculation that no dramatization can do the complicated president justice. Nixon was a drag, pure and simple. Fortunately, there are videos out there that give viewers a feel for Richard Nixon's place in history, sometimes without mentioning the man at all.
</P>



<P><B>All the President's Men</B> 1976 Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Robards Jr. 138 min. C. Redford and Hoffman star as two young, ambitious Washington Post reporters who shake up the Nixon presidency with their Watergate stories. Now 20 years old, this film may well be the greatest political drama ever made, and much of its greatness can be traced to its faithful account of the Post investigation (Oliver Stone take note!). Truth can be stranger than fiction. The result is an exhilarating, disturbing trip through Nixon's warped White House, his evil henchmen acting as tour guides. Jane Alexander's brave character will break your heart. This should have won the best picture Oscar in '76; Rocky won instead. Go figure.</P>



<P><B>The Conversation </B>1974 Gene Hackman, Frederic Forrest, Cindy Williams 113 min. C. This isn't a movie about Nixon. In fact, you won't learn a thing about him. What you will see is an America made ugly by people like Nixon and his thugs. Hackman plays a nerdy electronics expert who specializes in high-tech bugging (ah, Watergate!). No conversation is safe around Hackman and his super-sensitive microphones. Director Francis Ford Coppola presents a world of severe claustrophobia as well as an amorality play. Privacy is history. Information is gathered at any cost. Hackman is perfect (what's new?) as the man with fried values whose conscience finally eats at him. Watch for a young Harrison Ford.</P>


<P><B>Where the Buffalo Roam </B>1980 Bill Murray, Peter Boyle, Bruno Kirby 98 min. C. What an awful movie. Unsatisfactory in nearly every respect--except one. This flawed comedy illustrates the degree to which some people despised Richard Nixon. To them, Nixon will always be the Beast, and hating him is great fun. Murray plays a character based on Hunter S. Thompson, the acid-eating, bourbon-drinking, gun-loving writer whose best and funniest books attacked Nixon with almost every page. Except for a few scenes (Dobermans!), this film fails to recreate the humor and pace of Thompson's best writing, nor does it capture the anger and awful paranoia that were Thompson trademarks. Released the same year as Murray's much-funnier Caddyshack.</P>



<P>Finally, check out <B>Final Days</B>, a nine-minute sketch in The Best of Saturday Night Live 1976 95 min. C. Dan Aykroid's impersonation of Nixon is so perfect, so funny, many viewers may not notice (or notice but not care) that Aykroid has a moustache! Madeline Kahn is excellent as Nixon's wife Pat. The best--and meanest--in political satire.        <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<IMG ALT="W"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="w.jpeg">hen your star is on the rise, you can say crazy stuff and get away with it. But Rafaela Farias doesn't sound crazy. She sounds full of The Great American Dream, even when she says something really nuts like:
</P>




<P>"If you love what you're doing, money shouldn't matter."</P>





<P>The 28-year-old radio personality is hopelessly sincere. "I DJed at a radio station for four years for no money," she says, and you look at that heart-shaped face, deep into her honey-brown eyes, and you believe her every word and wonder why more people don't work 14 hours a day for black bread and water.</P>





<P>Farias, who goes by the moniker Ralph in real life and Rockin' Ralph on the air at 
<A HREF="http://www.wfbq.com">WFBQ-FM</A> in Indianapolis, combines hard work with equal parts enthusiasm and cuteness. She grins as she describes the handful of national radio commercials she recently recorded, but she positively beams as she explains the source of her work ethic and positive attitude--her parents.</P>





<P>Her Mexican-American parents were migrant farm laborers. They decided they would end the cycle of migrant life. Emilio Farias quit school in the eighth grade to work extra hours in the fields during hot Hoosier harvests, and he later toiled on a car lot before landing a factory job. Ralph's mother, Remigia Nunez, studied hard in high school and turned a love for typing into a scholarship to secretary school. When her family went back to South Texas at season's end, Remigia stayed in Indiana and furthered her education. Emilio and Remigia eventually met and married, settled down in quiet Union City, and raised their children to believe anything is possible if you're willing to work hard.</P>





<P>"To me, the American  Dream is fulfilling your goal, whatever it might be," says Ralph. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>We look forward to your comments, suggestions and criticisms. Please send your comments to <!-- MailTo Tag -->
<A HREF="feedform.html">ENTER</A> and please keep them brief (under 100 words). ENTER reserves the right to edit or not publish comments for reasons of grammar, spelling, length, decency and libelous content. Letters critical of the magazine should be addressed to the publisher. Cards and letters praising the magazine should be sent to the thinner-skinned editor.</P>




<P>Unlike some magazines, ENTER doesn't pretend to have all the answers. When we don't know something, we look it up. Or, when we don't look it up, we'll make up an answer that, right or wrong, seems to get us out of a jam.</P>





<P><B>Q: 	Why is it the hardest jobs at any company are reserved for the 	youngest and least-experienced employees? It sucks. The pay 	sucks, too.				</B><BR><BR>

			<I>Bad Attitude</I></P>





<P><B>A:</B>	This is America. You have to earn the right to sit on your butt 	and do nothing. Pay attention and one day you can attend 	meaningless meetings, take credit for the work of underlings 	and basically wait feverishly for the inevitable downsizing.</P>





<P><B>Q:	I've been asked to usher a friend's wedding. What are my 	responsibilities?</B>				<BR><BR>

<I>	Aisle 1, Row 3, Seat 5</I></P>





<P><B>A:</B>	According to Modern Bride magazine, your duties are few but 	important. For example, you must be at the wedding site an 	hour before the ceremony and have a typed list of guests that 	will sit in the reserved rows. Ushers ask each female guest if 	she is a friend of the bride or groom. Ushers then offer their 	right arm to the woman and escort her to an available seat on 	the appropriate side (bride's friends on the left, groom's on the 	right).
</P>




<P><B>Q:	I recently took a class in CPR and emergency first aid. Should I 	include that on my resume?	</B>		<BR><BR>

<I>Breathless in Seattle</I> 
</P>




<P><B>A:</B>	Certainly. Those little things add up and make you more 	valuable, especially to companies experiencing severe 	downsizing. You never know when someone in middle 	management might suffer a massive heart attaaacc.</P>





<P><B>Q:	I've been thinking about seeing a mental health professional to 	deal with some job-related stress, but I'm worried that 	insurance records are not kept entirely confidential at work. I 	don't want everyone at the office to know I'm going to a shrink. 	Should I be concerned?</B><BR><BR>

				<I>Worried Wally</I></P>





<P><B>A:</B>	Yup. According to the book Healthy Work: Stress, Productivity 	and the Reconstruction of Working Life (R. Karasek and T. 	Theorell, 1990, Basic Books), many employees deny problems 	exist for fear "of being laid off or punished if they complain 	about psychosocial conditions." Workers fear information 	gathered from "personality questionnaires and psychological 	consultations" might be "used against them." And it has 	happened. How do you protect yourself? A couple of things. 	First, provide as little information to your employer as possible. 	Secondly, try paying for mental health-related expenses out of 	pocket rather than through the company insurance.</P>





<P><B>Q:	I'm upset by a political commentary I saw on a local TV news 	broadcast in our area. If I write the station manager a letter, 	how can I be sure he'll read it?	</B><BR><BR>

<I>	The Scarlet Letter</I></P>





<P><B>A:</B>	You can be sure only if management acknowledges the letter 	by writing or calling you in return. But is that necessary? Do 	you know how many letters they get? You wrote a letter and 	made a point. Move on, bud.
</P>




<P><B>Q:	A bunch of us have decided you must be frauds. How can you 	have letters if this is your first issue on the Internet? Ha, 	fakers, you've been exposed!</B>	<BR><BR>

<I>	Mystery Hounds</I></P>





<P><B>A:</B>	Arrr, we'd have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for those 	meddling kids and their stupid dog.</P>





<P><B>Q:	My company is expecting an inspection from a state agency. 	Without getting specific, we're in deep trouble. Would it be 	appropriate to offer these hard-working civil servants a little 	something to make their time with us, uh, memorable?		</B><BR>
					<BR>
		<I>Morally Bankrupt</I>
</P>




<P><B>A:</B>	Huh? You skipped the ethics class, didn't you? We hope you're 	not asking us to encourage or endorse bribing government 	officials. No, not even in jest.
</P>




<P><B>Q:	I'm sick of the loudmouths who pass for sports announcers 	these days. Most of them are more into themselves than the 	game on TV. Every network's got at least three or four jerks 	that drive me nuts. Some of the worst announcers are the ex-	athletes. They act like they are the stars, not the teams on 	the field. Isn't anybody just interested in broadcasting the 	game?</B>				<BR>
	<BR>
<I>Cheesed in Wisconsin</I></P>





<P><B>A:</B>	Pat Summerall and Jim Kaat. Two former athletes, two different 	styles. Both men offer viewers knowledge and insight without 	showing off. There are many others, of course, but these 	gentlemen happen to be favorites.        <A HREF="feedform.html">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="nekid.jpeg">
<P>I'd rather write about the New Hampshire primary.</P>





<P>However, this is the first issue of a new magazine and you only get one opportunity to welcome a reader to a first issue. Like it or not, primaries will have to wait. There are other pressing concerns.</P>





<P>ENTER is being launched at a time when the Internet is under intense scrutiny. </P>





<P>As most of you already know, Washington discovered cyberspace and, not surprisingly, a number of Feds were shocked by the crap they saw. It was awful stuff. Disgusting. If the pornography didn't disturb them, surely the brazenness of the purveyors had to scare them to death. So the Feds did what they do best. The predictable "family values" legislation to come from all this discovery, the Communications Decency Act, is supposed to guard children from indecent material on the Internet.</P>





<P>Supporters of the legislation say Internet porn went unchecked too long. Congress is simply picking up the trash along the superhighway's greenbelt. Meanwhile, the First Amendment is safe for responsible adults. Not to worry.</P>





<P>Opponents are worried, though. The more vocal opponents see any legislation as a jackhammer chipping away at the First Amendment.</P>






<P>However, while the constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act is being debated Internet users should be looking to form societies, organizations and associations designed to represent the many journalists and business professionals on the Internet. The guidelines and codes of conduct that typically come from such societies won't do a thing to rid the Internet of the worst of the violent and sexually explicit material, but they would immediately distance serious Internet publishers from the worst cybertrash. And when questions of censorship arise in the future, publishers on the Internet would have an influential peer group prepared to speak on their behalf.
</P>




<P>A professional society would encourage debate on important Internet issues, sponsor enlightening programs and champion new publications like the one you're reading.</P>





<P>This is the first issue of ENTER magazine. There's no paper or ink, but ENTER is a magazine the way Time or TV Guide or Popular Science  are magazines. It deserves the same First Amendment rights enjoyed by Life, Good Housekeeping , Soldier of Fortune and Playboy. And ENTER should be expected to defend the right of those magazines to publish without fear, just as we would hope they would come to our defense if our rights were in peril.</P>





<P>That's the way it should be in America. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG ALT=""I"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="i.jpeg"> used this guide to determine what range the entry-level position I interviewed candidates for was worth," said Dick Beatty, the owner-president of an out placement consulting group for major corporations. Beatty has written 16 books on job hunting, four of them bestsellers. </P>





<P>Finding out what the low, middle, and high offers are in the salary guide can prove to be great ammunition when an offer is made to you, according to Beatty. </P>





<P>Having that salary information and relating it to a potential employer can prove to be tricky. Have you ever been hung up on the "Salary Desired" question on a job application? Write down Open or Negotiable according to Veatch. </P>





<P>"That's not going to eliminate me from talking to somebody. Whereas if somebody puts down $30,000 and my position only pays $25,000 I am going to find someone that is a little closer."</P>





<P>And Veatch's point of view is not unusual.</P>





<P>"Just write down the word Open," said Beatty. "Don't give an employer a reason to pay you less than what they're able to offer or knock yourself out of the running by writing something down too high."</P>

<HR SIZE=4 SHADE>

<P>Don't be fooled. Just because you've managed to dodge a salary figure up front, that doesn't mean you won't be asked again--and be expected to answer. </P>





<P>"When we ask for salary information in an interview you have to tell me what you want to make," said Debra Jones, a human resources manager, with more than 11 years of experience. "We gotta get something on the table."</P>





<P>Approach the subject by detailing why you feel you're worth the money you're about to ask for. Did you have an internship? Was your GPA above average? Did you work during school? These are just some of the questions you need to ask yourself before you're in the interview. Use your answers along with the data in the NACE guide to see if you may fit into a low, medium, or high pay range.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Baked Apples</H2>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P>This old favorite is a deceptively simple recipe. It makes a sweet, enticing desert, or a spicey treat any afternoon.</P>





<B>

<P>1.	Take your favorite apple, core it and peel the top half. 
</P>




<P>2.	Place in a oven-safe container just large enough to hold the apple.
</P>




<P>3.	Fill the center with 1 teaspoon of butter or margarine, 1 teaspoon<BR>
 brown sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon.
</P>




<P>4. 	Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Put apple in oven for 10 minutes. 
	Then baste the apple with the syrup in the bottom of the dish. </P>

	

<P>Bake for 10 more minutes.</P>







<P>5.	Repeat process until apple is tender when poked with a fork.</P>





<P>6.	Remove from oven carefully. Sprinkle more brown sugar if
 	desired.</P>


<P>Variations on a theme<BR>


Replace brown sugar with honey or omit the brown sugar and<BR>
 	cinnamon and fill the center with "red hot" candies.</P></B>

<P>Have you ever wanted to be romantic on short notice, and all that's in the refrigerator is beer, salsa, and chicken salad?  It's difficult, when you live alone, to be frugal with your money, but at the same time be elegant.  I have devised a menu that provides romance with easy steps, a small amount of time, and little money.  Get ready for a menu that will enhance a romantic evening!</P>



<BR>







<B>

<P>8-10 oz. of beef sirloin tips (you will probably have to buy beef sirloin 	and have the butcher cut it into pieces for you)</P>




<P>Burgundy wine or other dry red wine</P>




<P>1 red pepper</P>




<P>1 green pepper</P>




<P>1 small onion (I suggest vidalia or a white onion)</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of butter</P>




<P>1 small package of baby carrots</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of honey
White rice (enough for two people)
1 beef boullion cube</P>






<P>Directions</P>




<P>1. Cut the peppers into thin strips and discard the seeds.  Then cut the onion into thin rings.  Place enough of each for two people into a skillet with the butter.  Saute' until the veggies are hot and partially cooked, but still a bit crisp (about five minutes).  Set aside.</P>




<P>2. Heat a skillet or wok on high heat and add the beef tips.  Cook briefly on all sides to brown (this seals in the juices).  Turn the heat to medium, then add 1/4 -1/2 cup of the burgundy wine and continue to cook until the beef is no longer pink in the center.</P>




<P>3. While the beef is cooking, follow the directions for the rice and get that started.  Add the boullion to the water according to the instructions.  This will flavor the rice quite nicely.  </P>






<P>4. Go back to the beef tips while the rice is doing its thing.  Add the sauteed veggies to the tips, season to taste with salt and pepper, and turn the heat to low.</P>





<P>5. Check the rice before you move to the carrots.</P>






<P>6. The fastest and easiest way to cook these carrots is going to be in the microwave.  Put the carrots, about a teaspoon of water, and a dash of salt into a microwave safe container.  Cover with plastic wrap, place in the microwave, and cook on high for about three minutes.  After this time, poke them with a fork to test them.  They are done whenever they are as tender as you like.  Drain off the water, and add the honey.  Place the plastic wrap back over the bowl and place back inside the microwave (do not turn it on...this just provides a place to keep the carrots warm).</P>




<P>7. Check the rice.  Check the beef tips.  If everything is hot and done, you are ready to plate it up and eat it.  **If the sauce with the beef tips seems too runny, take about 1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon of cornstarch, mix it with a bit of cold water (to form a paste), and stir it into the beef tip mix.  This will thicken the sauce.  Continue to cook just a few minutes longer, and then serve.</P>



<P>Bon Appetit!</P></B>

<P>If you're satisfied with the information you have gotten so far, it's time to begin a thorough inspection of the vehicle.</P>





<B><P>Start the engine<BR></B>

Begin by starting the car and letting it run during the entire time you're checking things out.</P>





<P>"Sometimes people will try to mask engine problems by putting very heavy oil in the engine to quite it down," said Greg Geske of Lemon Aid. "You will be able to hear any problems by letting it run for a while."</P>





<P>Some sounds such as ticking may indicate stuck valves or lifters, and a knocking sound could be more severe.</P>





<B><P>Get inside<BR></B>

Go over every inch of the interior of the car. If there is a button or switch use it and check for and any signs of water stains or moisture. Explaining to a cop you bought this car and didn't know the brake lights were out may not get you out of a ticket.</P>




<B><P>Under the hood<BR></B>

Check all of the fluids and look for any leaks. This includes the oil, transmission, radiator (shut engine off for this and let it cool down), power steering, and brake fluids.</P>





<B><P>What color should they all be?<BR></B>

Oil--Light brown and should drip off the dipstick. Shouldn't look thick or black.<BR>

Transmission--Pink and shouldn't smell burnt.<BR>

Radiator--Green and not rusty. And look for green stains on the radiator that could mean leaks.<BR>

Power steering and Brake fluids--it's not the color that's important, make sure they're full.</P>





<B><P>Exhaust<BR></B>

Be careful not to burn yourself when you look for things as rust or damage. Also make sure the exhaust leaving the car is not blue or white. Blue smoke indicates the engine is burning oil and white means it is burning water. Either of these could mean costly repairs.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>That's why LemonBusters has been in business for more than six years, and business isn't slow at over 750 inspections a month. Their intense inspections are performed with diagnostic equipment and experienced mechanics.</P>





<P>"Our ASC certified master technicians will perform a complete 600-point mechanical, electrical, body, and chassis inspection on the vehicle," says Rizzo. "This inspection includes the entire drive train."</P>





<P>Inspecting the drive train involves the engine, transmission, differential, or four-wheel drive unit. 
</P>




<P>And the inspections rolls on. </P>





<P>They will evaluate the brakes, suspension, steering, exhaust, cooling, battery charging, air conditioning, and all the electrical systems before the car is driven anywhere. 
</P>




<P>"We then road test the vehicle for any type of driveability problems," says Rizzo. "such as transmission, shift quality, clutch operation, engine performance, as well as alignment, steering, and any braking problems."</P>





<P>After a thorough examination of the body and frame for any previous damage they will perform a title search and give you 120-point written report of what was found, all within one hour. This report is explained to you and gives approximate costs for making any repairs. All for $78, or $88 if it is a four-wheel drive vehicle.</P>

<P>Before you make the call sit down and realistically evaluate your situation. How much do you make? How much do you spend on the essentials? What can you bare to do without? </P>





<P>Most importantly is to stop using credit, according to Kim Donahue, education coordinator at Consumer Credit Counseling (CCC) (800-282-6196). CCC is a nationwide non-profit organization that works with over 5000 creditors.</P>

<P>If you feel that debt has consumed you it may be time to turn to a credit counseling agency. These agencies will examine your balance sheet and evaluate how much you owe and how much you make. Taking into account the essentials, they will establish a payment you make to them each month. The payment is then distributed out to each creditor you owe until the balance of your debt is eradicated.</P>







<P>But don't expect results overnight. You have taken the first step in repairing your financial situation, but it may take some time.</P>





<P>"We try to get people debt free in four years," said Donahue. Four years may seem long, but a lifetime of marred credit reports can be devastating. </P>






<P>Although there are many credit counseling agencies out there that can prove to be of valuable assistance in times of credit duress, a non-profit agency could prove to be a smart financial decision. </P>





<P>"We ask for a voluntary donation of nine dollars per month," said Donahue. This is a meager fee compared to pay-by-the-minute 1-900 lines and package deals that for-profit services offer. Also be aware, some agencies make you surrender your paycheck. Do you want to feel like your ten years old again?</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>he veil of secrecy around sending your resume to a company ends here. Three hiring professionals have stepped forward to unravel the mystery of what makes a powerful resume and what happens when your resume hits the hiring desk.</P>





<P>In today's tough job market, many college students and graduates are frustrated with the luke-warm response their resume seems to generate.</P>

 



<P>"I've been sending my resume out, but I haven't heard anything back," says Scott, a college graduate. "Every ad that I send my resume to says don't call. So I don't know what's going on."</P>





<P>What's wrong with the resume you're sending out? Why hasn't it gotten the response you're looking for?</P>





<P>"What is so frustrating about a lot of the resumes I receive is they leave it up to human resources (departments) to figure out how their skills fit into the company," says Sara Veatch, an associate relations manager, with more than eight years of experience. Veatch's eight years have exposed her to resumes from entry-level to executive level positions. "You need to tell me how you fit into the company."</P>





<P>If you're responding to an ad or sending your resume in blind, although it may be difficult, tailor the information to a specific position.
</P>




<P>"Your resume is a set of facts," says W.C. Bird, a vice president of human resources, with nine years of hiring experience. Those nine years have been spent hiring for sales and marketing positions. </P>





<P>Whether you're applying for a sales position or not, those facts need to sell you to an employer. And you don't have much time to make the pitch and close the deal.</P>





<P>"You get 10 seconds of my time," says Veatch. "I look to see what position you're applying for and then I look for supporting qualifications in the resume. If I don't see anything that qualifies you you go into 'the pile.'"

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>Y</FONT>ou've just graduated from college and said yes to a terrific job offer. The new boss wants you to start in two weeks, however, and the job means moving to a city several miles away. Before you reach for that first cardboard box, there are a few things you ought to know.</P>





<P>Apartment hunting is rarely fun. It usually involves numerous phone calls (often long distance) and a lot of driving (sometimes over great distances). It can include negotiating with landlords or office managers. Just when you think you're stressed to the breaking point, there is a decision to be made, <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="rent1a.jpeg">one you should be prepared to live with--and live in--for the length of your lease.</P>






<P>Here are some--though by no means all--of the basic questions and concerns a smart first-time apartment shopper should address. For purposes of brevity, most of our examples deal with complex living as opposed to that great second-floor flat in the renovated warehouse or the spartan quarters over your buddy's garage.</P>





<P>Start with solid resource information, which should include:</P>





<P>
<UL>
<LI>The classified ads or real estate section from the newspaper in 	   or near the city where you're moving.
<LI>An "apartment guide" from your new city.
<LI>One or two professional apartment locators in the area.
<LI>A book of advice for renters.
<LI>The phone numbers of some friends or future co-workers familiar with your new city.
<LI>A detailed apartment "wish list."
</UL></P>





<P>It doesn't matter which of these resources you use to kick off your search. There are often one or more free apartment guides published in larger metro areas, and these little magazines can be a good place to start because they feature the sort of apartment photos that can spark ideas for your wish list. Or you can start with the classified ads. Of course, if you come across any ads that begin "SWM seeks attractive SWF," you're in the wrong section.</P>





<P>In his book The Renter's Survival Kit (1993 Dearborn Financial Publishing, Inc.), author Ed Sack says safety should be a chief concern when looking at an apartment's location. Cathy Sharp of Apartment Showplace agrees.

<IMG ALT="When"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="when.jpeg">it comes to knowing what you're worth to a company the cards may in fact seem stacked against you. Maybe you've played a game of Go Fish with a potential employer. The game goes like this: "Do you have an ace?" you ask cautiously. "Nope, better luck next time. Go fish," the employer replies. All you find in the mess of cards is deuces. 
</P>




<P>"Job interviews are all a game so you just have to be careful how you play your cards," said Sara Veatch, an associate relations manager, with more than eight years of experience.</P>





<P>To straighten that mess of cards out you must first know how much the position you are interviewing for pays on the job market. Libraries and bookstores are littered with salary guides, but those guides are packed with figures from people with one to three years of experience. 
</P>




<P>Information overload.</P>





<P>One reliable source to find out what your colleagues are being offered fresh out of school is the Salary Survey published quarterly by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE). The guide is located in almost every college career center.

<P><FONT SIZE=5>I</FONT>t turns out becoming a professional beer taster requires more than the ability to do one-handed keg stands. But, remember, this is America. Talented folks are being discovered all the time. Hell, you don't even need talent, you just need luck. Two words to prove my point: Tori Spelling. When you consider the cosmic imbalance that had to occur for that career to exist, your odds of becoming the first "discovered" beer taster seem more than favorable. But when the opportunity arises, you'll need to impress breweries with more than your uncanny ability to beer-gargle the theme to <I>Three's Company</I>.</P>

<P>So take a gander at this little crash course on beer tasting. This should not take the place of formal education, of course, but it might convince people you drink beer for reasons other than getting stinking drunk. It may even fool people into thinking you're an intellectual.</P>





<B><P>Color</P></B>





<P>Most of us don't pay attention to this detail--a pitfall of drinking directly out of cans and/or brown bags. But if you want to win friends and influence people, you'll need to incorporate this into your drinking repertoire. You can usually predict how a beer will taste by its color. And if you have even one active brain cell left, this part is cake:</P>


	


<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="beermug.jpeg"><BR>

A light-colored beer usually means a light, malty flavor.</P><BR>

<B><P>Aroma
</P></B>




<P>This requires some theatrics. If you do it well, it's sure to make men applaud and women swoon. If you're comparing several beers, choose the lightest color first. To achieve the proper sniffage, swirl the glass (gently) to release the aroma and sniff. (Plunging your nose directly into the beverage is not recommended.) Then, of course, give your interpretation of what you're smelling. However, you'll need some vocab besides the words "neat-o," "peeww" and "smells like gym socks." Here are a few words to help:</P>




<UL>
<LI>Sulfidy: yeasty
<LI>Estery: fruity 
<LI>Grainy: starchy, smells like grain 
<LI>Sour: (c'mon)
<LI>Bouquet: the overall aroma of the beer
</UL>



<B><P>Taste</P></B>





<P>You may think you've got this part down, but it's not as simple as it sounds. Most of us slide beer past our tongue so quickly, we're only left with an aftertaste to guide us. And while the aftertaste is certainly important, you need to reacquaint yourself with your tongue and its many glorious functions to fully experience beer.</P>





<P>Think back to the days of health class film strips. Remember those diagrams of the tongue? If you do, you know that different regions of the tongue taste different qualities. The tip of the tongue tastes sweetness/bitterness. The middle of the tongue tastes saltiness. And the back of the tongue registers those aftertastes we know and love.</P>





<P>After you're comfortable with the intricate workings of your tongue, you're ready to taste beer. Take a drink and hold it in your mouth for a moment. Concentrate on how the beer tastes on each part of your tongue. Once you've isolated the beer's qualities, you can talk about each of them and how you feel they affect the overall taste of the beer. 
</P>




<P>A truly talented beer taster should know what ingredients and techniques produce each of these characteristics. That kind of information is a little too complicated for the likes of this article, so until you get a chance to study, you can make use of this gross, yet informative, oversimplification: The two main characteristics of beer are sweetness and bitterness. Sweetness is a result of malt and bitterness is a result of hops.</P>







<P><B>A note on aftertaste</B></P>







<P>This is often misunderstood. The dogmas of societal beverage consumption teach us that anything with an aftertaste is swill and should be labeled as such by means of an exaggerated grimace. But aftertaste in beer is both important and desirable. It is the aftertaste that provides the most information about the type and style of beer you're tasting. So don't dog the aftertaste. Aftertaste is your friend.</P>





<B><P>But wait, there's more!</P></B>





<P>The information you've read here is just the tip of the brewing iceberg. If you plan on breaking into the fast-paced, glamorous world of beer tasting, you need to further your education. There are several sites on the web that contain great information, or you could call up a friend and ask them for directions to your local library. Despite the fact that they don't serve beer, they do have information about it. And by all means, practice, practice, practice! </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>S</FONT>ounds like the perfect job, huh? After all, what could be better training than four (five, six, seven) years of college? I know I spent several Saturday nights trying to match my blood alcohol level with my GPA. I put in countless hours sleeping in dumpsters clutching 40-ouncers in both hands. And I took advantage of every opportunity to turn my liver into something resembling a fossilized lima bean. But I was surprised to find out that becoming a beer taster is hard work. If you think your ability to bong several metric tons of Schlitz will land you a job like this, it's time to sober up.</P>





<P>According to Donald Kent, a salesman for a midwestern beer distributor, most professional beer tasters are authors. Professional beer tasters "usually work for publishing houses or publications. Basically, they're specialized food critics," Kent says. "They travel the world tasting beer and writing about it. So it's probably a good idea to have some kind of background in English or journalism. And on top of that, many have experience as a brewmaster's assistant." 	</P>





<P>Brewmaster's assistant? That didn't sound very arduous. I found out, however, that becoming a brewmaster's assistant involves two more years of studying in a brewing academy. I envisioned classes like Foam 101 and Belching: Beer Remembered. But the curriculum includes a steady schedule of chemistry, biology and other yeasty sciences. So you see, becoming one of these beer-tasting food critics is quite a commitment.</P>

 



<P>I wasn't born yesterday. I watch TV, and I happen to know that every brewery needs someone within the facility to taste their beer. This was my next line of inquiry. Unfortunately, the outcome was similar. "This type of tasting is usually done in the brewery by a quality control panel, consisting mostly of the brewmasters themselves," Kent says. "But occasionally they do use test markets." </P>





<P>Ah, a ray of hope. I jumped on that tidbit like drunken sailor on a beer nut. According to Kent, when breweries are testing out a new beer, they take their product to the people. If you're lucky enough to be part of the demographic they're targeting, you may just get a taste. This won't lead to a job, but it may lead to a new favorite beer. However, the breweries have to find you. Pull up a stool and grab a brew--you might be waiting a while.</P>





<P>Don't lose heart. There are other ways to embark on the long road to barley and hops enlightenment. "You can gain some relevant insight from brewing your own or working for a beer distributor," Kent says. "But the easiest thing you can do is to just start tasting all kinds of beer." Amen.</P></TD><TD><!--space--!></TD></TR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>W</FONT>hat's up with the New Release section of video stores? They always look like the shelves of a Toys R Us after a pre-Christmas sale. Scalpers hang around outside with their returnables. Sweet old ladies turn into venom-spitting pro wrestlers if you're lucky enough to be able to challenge them to the last copy of a candy-ass Cruise or Pitt release. And entering the no-man's land of the general rentals is almost as painful as watching all the Mentos commercials back to back.</P>

<P>So, how do you avoid settling for the latest Merchant-Ivory snoozer or going into insulin shock with the new release from Disney?</P> 

<P>Take a peek into this reviewer's files. I find entertainment. The quirky, funny, thrilling and, yes, sometimes romantic, cinematic trash we all love to watch. This month: graduation flicks.</P>



<BR>

<P><I>"Where does he find this stuff?"</I></P>
<P><B>The Big Picture</B> 1989 Kevin Bacon, Jennifer Jason Leigh 101 min. Color. There's not much funny about looking for a job--unless you're graduating from film school. From the comic co-creators of Spinal Tap, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean, comes this savagely funny satire on Hollywood as we follow the rise, then fall, then rise of award-winning young filmmaker (Bacon) as he tries to create a "human" film only to have it twisted by a clueless studio mogul into the kind of silly trash we review in this column. Great trashy performances by Teri Hatcher (TV's <I>Lois & Clark</I>) and Martin Short as a Hollywood agent.</P>

<P>Category: Comedy</P>

<BR><BR>

<P><I>Classics</I></P>
<P><B>The Graduate</B> 1967 Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft 105 min. Color. What graduation movie review would be complete without this perennial classic? The Oscar-winning coming-of-age comedy that launched Hoffman's career and spoke to a generation. Follow aimless college grad (before we were called slackers) Hoffman as he is seduced by the glamorous older Mrs. Robinson (a sexy Bancroft), only to fall in love with her daughter (Katharine Ross). Director Mike Nichols shows early promise as a music video director with endless filler backed by amazing Simon and Garfunkel songs. </P>

<P>Other Oscar award winners/nominees starring Hoffman: Midnight Cowboy,  Little Big Man, Lenny, Kramer vs. Kramer, Rain Man </P>

<P>Category: Comedy</P>
<BR><BR>
<P><B>Diner</B> 1982 Steve Guttenburg, Mickey Rourke 110 min. Color. As graduation approaches, you're probably wondering what the future holds for you. Well, since you might be wondering this for a while, why not rent a movie about a bunch of guys just hanging out trying to figure out what they're going to do with their lives in 1950s Baltimore. Director Barry Levinson's warm, heartfelt comedy centers around a group of young men, their favorite hangout and the choices they face as they enter dreaded "adulthood." Great performances by the ensemble cast, including Daniel Stern, Kevin Bacon and Ellen Barkin.</P>

<P>Rourke's other good films: Rumble Fish, The Pope of Greenwich Village, Barfly, Angel Heart</P>
<P>Category: Comedy</P>

<BR><BR>
<P><I>"Remember this?"</I></P>
<P><B>How I Got Into College</B> 1989 Corey Parker, Anthony Edwards 89 min. Color. Yeah, yeah, we know. It's not exactly college graduation, but indulge us. After all, who can forget this rite of passage that sends shivers down the spines of millions of teens every year. If you can't quite remember your own nightmare, follow would-be freshman Corey Parker down the twisted paths of college admissions and it'll make you glad you never have to do that again. (Now all you have to do is find a job.) Edwards (<I>ER</I>) helps him through this trauma--also stars Lara Flynn Boyle.</P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"> 
<BR>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG  SRC="leasehead.jpeg"></P>

<BR>
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>here are people for whom leasing a new car might be an attractive option. But leasing isn't for the faint of heart. If you qualify, the process and terms of the deal can be complicated enough to drive the most experienced CPAs and tax attorneys bonkers, and the average consumers, if they're not careful, can find themselves driven straight to the cleaners.</P>





<P>To give you an example of what you're in for when leasing,  Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine quoted a general manager of a large import-make dealership: "Unfortunately, buyers are not really wise on leasing right now...If you are willing to pay $250 a month, I can make a lot of money on you. If you haven't compared me with other dealers on the details, I can probably really take advantage of you...if I were that kind of guy." </P>





<P>Leasing is all about the fine print so it's important to decide if this option is right for you. According to <I>Car Buyer's and Leaser's Negotiating Bible</I> by W. James Bragg (1996 Random House) there are advantages.</P>




<UL>
<LI>Monthly payments are lower.
<LI>You can drive a new car every two years.
<LI>You can drive cars you couldn't afford to buy.
<LI>Rarely a down payment.
</UL>



<P>Coming straight out of college, the lack of a down payment and low monthly payments are very attractive, but according to Bragg there are also disadvantages.</P>





<P>
<UL>
<LI>Leasing usually means keeping your miles under 15,000 a year.
<LI>You have zero equity in the car.
<LI>Leased cars aren't covered by "lemon laws."
<LI>End-of-lease charges can be killers.
</UL></P>





<P>Mileage can kill any initial cost advantage you may have if you drive a lot. Written into every lease is a cost-per-mile if you exceed the maximum allotment. The charge ranges from 10 to 15 cents a mile.
</P>




<P>If you're ready to look at leasing as an option, always remember to get the best price you can on the car first. Even if you know what payment your monthly budget allows, and you're set on leasing, you'll lose any negotiating advantage if you let the dealer know that payment up front. Make sure you're getting the car and options you want at what you believe is a good price. Consult new-car pricing guides such as Edmunds and Consumer Digest for option packages and retail prices. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>M</FONT>y car is a light blue 1989 Acura Integra, which I bought last year from a woman I worked with. She was the original owner and said she never had a problem with the car, a claim I believe. She wouldn't lie to me because we're friends and, besides, I know where she lives. 
</P>




<P>The car looks great and runs even better. Aside from routine maintenance, the only thing I've had done to it was have the clutch adjusted. I've never had anything major done to it. Nothing expensive. There is a little circle of rust on the driver's side door but that's all. It's been a great car.</P>





<P>The reason I've got so many miles on it is because I live in New Jersey. I'm always driving to New York, everywhere. In New Jersey, you go to the beaches a lot in the summer. The majority of the miles are highway miles.</P>


<A HREF="gluerules.html"><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="gluecar.jpeg" BORDER=0></A>



<P>I'm actually selling my Integra to my little sister. It'll be her first car and she needs something dependable because the twit is truly ruthless behind the wheel. I'm going to buy a Honda Accord. I can only hope the Honda lasts as long.</P>

<P>The first step to ending the debt nightmare is to contact your creditors directly and throw yourself onto their mercy, according to Stephen Rhode, president of
<A HREF="http://www.debt-experts.com/">Debt Counselors of America</A> (800-680-3328), a non-profit credit counseling agency.  </P>





<P>By contacting your creditors you can fend off any calls or stop the ones that may already be coming. Creditors don't enjoy trying to track down their delinquent accounts, and most are willing to work with you to establish a payment plan. But be ready to answer some tough questions about why you haven't been paying. </P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>here was a time when a person could expect to take a job after college, work for 30 years and retire with a gold watch. Few employees spend their entire career with one company these days, and a person is lucky to get a handshake upon retirement, let alone a snazzy Seiko. In fact, for a growing percentage of America's labor force, temporary employment has become a necessary fact of life, not an option.</P>





<P>Despite statistics that would suggest the nation's economy is healthy and getting healthier, a number of companies turn to temps rather than hire permanent full-time personnel. Where two or three national temp agencies may have been enough to plug the country's clerical job holes 20 years ago, there may be as many as 60 or more agencies listed in some metro telephone books today. ENTER interviewed managers at nearly 20 temporary agencies about the industry's growth, the current job market and landing permanent employment. The agencies included large national companies and small regional or local agencies. While clerical workers remain the backbone of the temp industry, many of the agencies offer highly specialized workers in an unlimited number of fields, including construction, landscaping, medical services and computer programming.</P>




<IMG WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=194 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="go.gif">


<P>Kelly Temporary Services began as an agency noted for its reliable pool of secretaries, receptionists and other clerical personnel. Now in its 50th year, Kelly also offers workers in marketing, technical and light industrial areas, says supervisor Erica Doud, and gone is the temp image that inspired the company's trademark "Kelly Girl."</P>






<P>"It's not just girls today," Doud says.</P>





<P>Doud says "temp services are the thing right now. That's why there are so many around."</P>





<P>Like most temporary agencies, Kelly doesn't charge fees to applicants. Employers pay a per-person, per-hour fee; Kelly handles tax withholding and distributes the paycheck to the worker. And insurance benefits are available to workers at some of the larger agencies.</P>

<P>Manpower Temporary Services, the largest of the temp agencies with more than a thousand offices around the world, is responsible for all the typical personnel paperwork, according to branch manager Teresa Ford. "While a temporary is with a company, they're our burden," Ford says.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>M</FONT>y freshman year of college was spent in Iowa. I hated it. The school was full of small-town jocks and wannabe frat boys and girls.</P>





<P>My work-study job was in the admissions office. You know those official looking letters you get right after you graduate from high school? Well, me and about five other people signed them. It was like a mini sweatshop, these college students in the basement of the administration building signing "John Doe, Director of Admissions" and stuffing envelopes for hours on end.</P>


<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="postaltoon.jpeg">


<P>Later that spring, I was able to transfer to another school for the fall semester. I got the news in March. I didn't tell them, though. I started signing other people's names to the letters. I did Elvis, Mr. Stinky Pants, all that stuff. So the letters would look like: </P>





<P>"Thank you for your interest in Ivy-Covered College. We are dedicated to serving America's youth, yadda yadda yadda. 
</P>




<P>Sincerely,<BR>

JOHNNY ROCKET!!!<BR>


John Doe,<BR>

Director of Admissions"</P>





<P>After I got tired of that, I started signing the director's name with my left hand, making it look like he was retarded.</P>





<P>At the same time that started to get old, they let me work on the database, entering new names for the mailing list. The system had a nickname field. If your name was Michael Jones, I would type "Mike" in the nickname field and the letter would read "Dear Mike." But I didn't type Mike. I went through all the names I'd signed and added new ones like Bubbles, Ragnor, Groc (I went through a Viking phase), Buttplug, and so on. They never caught me and all those letters went out the summer after I left.</P>

<HEAD><TITLE>Enter Magazine--Boxing's New Form</TITLE></HEAD> 
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"> 
<BR>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG  SRC="boxinghead.jpeg">
</P>



<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>A</FONT>ngela Brasher makes friends easily. She's soft-spoken but accessible. Her toothy smile and expressive brown eyes make people feel comfortable immediately. Angela also has a fast right hand that can peel the skin off your face and turn your brains into lumpy tapioca pudding.</P>





<P>That's just fine with Bob Chambers, who watches Angela with fascination and admiration. He's a veteran coach and manager who, at 54, finds himself squarely in the middle of the hottest revolution in sports--women's boxing.</P>





<P>"She impresses me a lot because she's got so much heart. She picked it up just like that," says Chambers, who is surrounded by boxing trophies at his desk at the Riverside Community Center in Indianapolis. "There's a lot she's gotta work on, but she works real hard."</P>


<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="boxing1.jpeg">



<P>It's been true throughout history that, while the sport's brutality repulses some women, others find themselves inexplicably drawn to boxing and its gladiators. Chambers even remembers a brave few who would venture into the ring to work out as early as the 1960s when he was a promising light heavyweight. In the last few years, though, an increasing number of women around the country have thrown serious punches of their own, competing alongside men in the "sweet science." They fought in obscurity, of course, and most of the grizzled gym rats considered them nothing more than novelties--when they considered them at all.</P>





<P>Then Christy Martin, 27, decisioned Deirdre Gogarty of Ireland in a furious six-round prelim to the recent Mike Tyson-Frank Bruno WBC heavyweight championship bout. Covered in her own blood, Martin triumphed over stereotype, and suddenly even the old men took notice. </P>



<P>There are women ready to bake in the rays of Martin's celebrity. Sue Leonard, 31, has been boxing for four years. A social worker studying for her doctorate in public administration, Leonard says she first considered boxing after an especially awful day at work. "I wanted to hit something," she says with a smile.
</P>




<P>"Mr. Chambers was very open to my being here. Archie (Chambers' son) was my first trainer," says Leonard, who counts "stamina and courage" as her strengths but "needs to work on basics."</P>





<P>Chambers points in Leonard's direction. "There goes a lot of heart," he says with fatherly pride. If someone had told him 30 years ago that he would someday coach women like Leonard and Brasher, Chambers would have laughed--or nailed 'em with a killer combination. He knew hunger and heart when he saw it, however, and he welcomed the women into the male-dominated world.</P>





<P>"My ideal fighter is about 6'3", 195 pounds. He's tall, lean, has a good jab, fast hands," Chambers says, knowing all the time his portrait is of a man. "You're born with fast hands. You can't develop fast hands. You can develop quickness, not speed. Reflex is so important."</P>





<P>Chambers speaks kindly of former heavyweight champ Ken Norton, the muscular ex-Marine who shared the title briefly in 1978. But Norton's powerful physique worked against him, "because, if anything, muscles slow you up. Women have an advantage there. If you watch women, many of them have quicker hand speed than men."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Q: Is it true that hair continues to grow even after you're dead?</B> <I>Keith the Rat</I></P>





<P>A: Absolutely, Keith. You want proof? Look at Willie Nelson.
</P>




<P><B>Q: About your story on salaries last month, aren't we at the mercy of employers? I graduated last year and was shocked at how low starting salaries were in my field (teaching). The attitude of some employers seems to be "take what I give you or walk." </B><I>C.D.W.</I></P>





<P>A: Don't knock walking. It's great exercise and often good for the dignity. If you think a salary offer is insulting--and you don't mind unemployment--don't accept the job. Somebody hungry will come along who'll find that offer very attractive. And that's what keeps those salaries down.</P>

<P>C: Great magazine. </B><I>Michael S., J.D. and Paul, Arizona State</I></P>

<P><B>Q: This doesn't have anything to do with anything, but my feet really stink. I shower every day, but my girlfriend is, like, really sick of my feet. Any advice?</B> <I>Toe Jam in Georgia</I></P>





<P>A: Try corn starch or talcum powder. You could wear thick cotton socks to absorb all the sweat. And there are deodorants specifically for feet. If all that fails, you can follow the example of several organized-crime figures from the '20s and '30s who solved their problem with something called "cement slippers."</P>





<P><B>Q: What can you tell me about Shawn Michaels, the hottest wrestler in the WWF?</B><I> The Nasty</I> </P>





<P>A: The long-haired former WWF Intercontinental champ is 6' and 234 pounds. He used to be called "Boy Toy." He won his title by beating Jeff Jarrett last year in Nashville but had to forfeit the belt due to injuries. I can't believe I'm writing this. Somebody slap me.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>A</FONT> lot of people -- members included -- are realizing the National Rifle Association is dangerous to our national health. That's the good news. The bad news is the NRA still carries enough cash and clout to spook a timid House into<IMG  SRC="gun.jpeg" ALIGN=RIGHT> repealing good legislation, the 1994 ban on certain assault weapons.
</P>





<P>President Clinton has vowed to stamp the repeal DOA should it pass the Senate. That's nice to hear, but Americans should be concerned about a pansy Congress that's quick to dump intelligent law in exchange for filthy NRA campaign contributions.</P>





<P>Oh, you say, House members wouldn't jeopardize the lives of Americans just because a special interest group with three million members decided to fund a few campaigns. Wanna bet? The NRA proudly claims to have spent nearly $1.5 million in the 1994 election. House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) put repeal of the assault weapons ban high on his Contract with White Conservative America. These people don't care if you or someone you love gets smoked by a stray bullet from a high-powered semiautomatic rifle. They don't give a damn if some squirrel decides to mow down kids on a playground in your neighborhood. Polls say people are indifferent on gun control this election, and this Congress is confident you won't cast your vote based on this one issue.</P>





<P>Nobody was indifferent two years ago, and the resulting ban on 19 semiautomatic weapons and large magazines was a triumph of common sense over NRA extremism. Later, Americans took notice of the NRA's strident position in the weeks and months following the inferno at Waco and the terrorist bombing at Oklahoma City, and they decided they'd had enough of the goofy gun lobby.</P>





<P>Roughly 400,000 members quit the NRA in 1995. These good Americans believe in the Second Amendment right to own firearms, but they grew tired of being bunched with militia nuts, religious kooks, racist jerks and antigovernment bananas. They no longer wanted to be associated with an organization that fanned the flames of hate among its mouth-breathing members, then arrogantly denied the practice.</P>





<P>The decent people who quit the NRA believe there's nothing wrong with owning a gun for sport, hunting or protection, but you don't go deer hunting with Kevlar-piercing bullets and AK-47s.</P>





<P>A year has passed since the Oklahoma City bombing. People are forgetting all the angry rhetoric that inflamed and inspired the antigovernment terrorists. Militia members are holed up in Montana and two men were busted in Georgia with all the ingredients necessary to make bombs. The NRA wants to distance itself from these extremists. The NRA wants you to forget.</P>





<P>Don't forget. Don't ever forget Oklahoma City. Remind Congress.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>Y</FONT>our palms are wet and your heart is pounding. You're stuck in the hot seat and about to give a performance that details everything from school to what jobs you've held. You'll be probed and analyzed, and the entire time you may never know if your going to make it. This unscripted and almost impromptu act must go like clockwork if you want the job.</P>

   



<P>Welcome to the world of job interviews.  If you're prepared for the interrogation you'll be able to distinguish yourself from the competition. According to Scott Lashley, a human resource manager with four years of experience, the key to a successful interview is to research the company you're interviewing with, and he emphasizes, "be prepared for anything."</P>


<IMG WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=285 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="don2a.gif">


<P>John Veatch, a human resource manager with four years of experience agrees, "Be ready for any type of question. I want to know what you know about us."</P>

 



<P>The best way to acquire knowledge about the company you're interviewing with is to start finding information at the library and on the Internet before the interview. Focus your search to not only general information, but also find information about the position you want. According to Veatch the more informed you are the better your questions are about the company. </P>





<P>"I place a lot of emphasis on questions asked of me," says Lashley. "It helps me to interpret someone's knowledge." Your preparation will not only show your knowledge and interest in the company and position, but it will set you apart from the competition. </P>





<P>"The question I like the best is when someone asks me what I like most about the company," says Veatch. </P>





<P>Although being prepared also means that you need to bring the right materials to the interview. "I like to get your resume, manuscript of classes and any references up front," says Veatch. </P>





<P>Even though the interviewer already has your resume, and will be asking questions framed around it, walking into an interview with the right materials can distance you from the competition from the outset. You immediately establish that you can take the initiative to provide necessary information without being asked first.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>he veil of secrecy around sending your resume to a company ends here. Three hiring professionals have stepped forward to unravel the mystery of what makes a powerful resume and what happens when your resume hits the hiring desk.</P>





<P>In today's tough job market, many college students and graduates are frustrated with the luke-warm response their resume seems to generate.</P>

 



<P>"I've been sending my resume out, but I haven't heard anything back," says Scott, a college graduate. "Every ad that I send my resume to says don't call. So I don't know what's going on."</P>





<P>What's wrong with the resume you're sending out? Why hasn't it gotten the response you're looking for?</P>





<P>"What is so frustrating about a lot of the resumes I receive is they leave it up to human resources (departments) to figure out how their skills fit into the company," says Sara Veatch, an associate relations manager, with more than eight years of experience. Veatch's eight years have exposed her to resumes from entry-level to executive level positions. "You need to tell me how you fit into the company."</P>





<P>If you're responding to an ad or sending your resume in blind, although it may be difficult, tailor the information to a specific position.
</P>




<P>"Your resume is a set of facts," says W.C. Bird, a vice president of human resources, with nine years of hiring experience. Those nine years have been spent hiring for sales and marketing positions. </P>





<P>Whether you're applying for a sales position or not, those facts need to sell you to an employer. And you don't have much time to make the pitch and close the deal.</P>





<P>"You get 10 seconds of my time," says Veatch. "I look to see what position you're applying for and then I look for supporting qualifications in the resume. If I don't see anything that qualifies you you go into 'the pile.'"

<IMG ALT="When"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="when.jpeg">it comes to knowing what you're worth to a company the cards may in fact seem stacked against you. Maybe you've played a game of Go Fish with a potential employer. The game goes like this: "Do you have an ace?" you ask cautiously. "Nope, better luck next time. Go fish," the employer replies. All you find in the mess of cards is deuces. 
</P>




<P>"Job interviews are all a game so you just have to be careful how you play your cards," said Sara Veatch, an associate relations manager, with more than eight years of experience.</P>





<P>To straighten that mess of cards out you must first know how much the position you are interviewing for pays on the job market. Libraries and bookstores are littered with salary guides, but those guides are packed with figures from people with one to three years of experience. 
</P>




<P>Information overload.</P>





<P>One reliable source to find out what your colleagues are being offered fresh out of school is the Salary Survey published quarterly by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE). The guide is located in almost every college career center.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/movnsound/case.wav"><IMG WIDTH=58 HEIGHT=68  SRC="/june/tocart/audio.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=0></A>"Keep in touch." <BR>



	

<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT> remember muttering this phrase to my friend Stinky Mahoney 34 times the day of graduation. However, I soon realized there was a problem with staying in touch--neither of us had any idea where the hell we were going. So we exchanged hometown addresses and promised to call each other in a couple weeks when our hangovers were gone to get a more informative address. But because I was busy with a new job and Stinky is, well, Stinky, a year went by before I finally got around to calling him. By this time Stinky's parents had picked up and moved, Cocker Spaniel and all, to Bora Bora. There was no scent of Stinky.</P>


	

<P>This scenario probably sounds familiar--we've  all lost a Stinky or two. The question is what to do about it. You could hire a private detective, try to get a spot on <I>America's Most Wanted</I>, or dust off your crystal ball and channel some cosmic vibes. But there's a much better, more economical way to find lost loved ones. It's called Find People Fast.</P>


	


<P><B>Who?</B></P>


	

<P>Find People Fast provides information useful in locating people living in the United States. They're not private investigators. They don't tote around micro cameras or wear trench coats. (You'll have to do the stalking yourself.) They search through the populace via computer--and do quite an impressive job. Many people who've been conducting their own search for decades find people in days or weeks using FPF. Since they began in 1992, FPF has found 50,000 people, a success rate of 80 percent. </P>


	


<P><B>How Find People Fast Works</B></P>


	

<P>FPF's computer resources are the most extensive available for locating people. Their database system is a hodge-podge of publicly accessible info-- "a combination of phone books, voter registration info and junk mail listings to name a few," says Kimberly Green, FPF marketing manager. But rest assured FPF is not a bunch of kids who've modified their Speak-n-Spells to act as a digital Rolodex. One of the founders, Graham Bloy, is a hard-core computer guru who boasts 25 patents for his computer designs. And in addition to their own database, FPF has access to four or five other databases outside their St. Louis office that aide in isolating the exact coordinates of lost Stinkys everywhere. In total, FPF has information on 170 million adults. </P>


	


<P><B>Who They Can Find</B></P>


	

<P>As long as the person you're looking for lives in the United States and is older than 18, FPF can probably find 'em--with the right information. Some cases are more difficult than others, however. The elderly are an example of this. "It can be difficult to find older people sometimes because they may live in homes or with one of their children. That makes them a little more difficult to track down," says Green. But as they point out on their website, most people are not trying to hide and don't consider themselves lost. So unless you're searching for a pal who's been running from the law since sixth grade because he stole a box of Junior Mints, you should have pretty good luck. </P>




<P>They've reunited childhood friends, lost loves and birth parents of adoptees, to name a few. They even do work for law firms and, occasionally, creditors. (Apologies to all those who planned on defaulting on student loans.) If you ask, they'll even track down someone who's passed away. Best of all, they'll mail your search report the next business day.</P>


	

<P>Obviously, FPF is a powerful tool in the field of lost and found. And they take extra precautions to ensure that their power is used for good and not evil. If you've spent the last 10 years running from your old neighbor, Wilbur the Psycho Nailclipper Man, you needn't worry. "When we run across a search order that looks questionable, we take all precautions necessary to avoid endangering anyone." says Green.</P>


	


<P><B>How to Contact Find People Fast</B></P>




<P>There are a variety of ways. As you might have guessed, we at ENTER are a little partial to websites. And FPF has a very informative one. There you can find all the information you need to begin a search. (Check out the e-mail address and URL at the end of this article.) You'll find all the gory details on what kind of information you need to provide. You'll also find that you don't really need that much--a first and last name usually does the trick. They also include an easy-to-understand price guide so you know exactly what your search will cost. And it generally doesn't cost a lot. For example, an individual name search starts at $39.00. Besides e-mail, you can place an order by phone, mail or fax. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>O</FONT>kay. By a show of hands, who else thinks America's funniest home video would be the televised execution of Bob Saget's joke writers? Do you equate watching Erkel to, say, a root canal with a chainsaw? What kind of people choose to cancel intelligent, well-produced shows like <I>Hill Street Blues</I>, <I>I'll Fly Away </I>and <I>Twin Peaks</I> only to insult viewers, night after night, by broadcasting the aforementioned crap?</P>





<P>Actually, it could be you. Or your neighbor. Because the 
fate of your favorite TV shows lies in the hands of the mythical Nielsen family. Like the famed monster of that Scottish lake, many don't believe Nielsen families really exist. Or they think it's a creation of the networks to control the masses through mindless televised drivel. Mostly because few people have met a genuine Nielsen family.</P>


<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="family.jpeg">


<P>Truth is, no one knows who the Nielsen families are. And the "families" won't tell you. Although it may sound like the type of conspiracy that would make Fox Mulder moist, these highly scientific methods make A.C. Nielsen the most respected and reliable viewer measurement service in the nation. According to a Nielsen source, the actual family sampling process can be complicated and many times the households aren't necessarily families in the "2.5 children" sense. In a nutshell, the Nielsen families are chosen as a representative cross-section of every type of household--from the single person living in a New York flat to members of the Freemen militia compound in rural Montana.</P>


 


<P>Unfortunately, you can't volunteer to be a Nielsen family. Some people have turned down the opportunity. According to Anne Elliot of the A.C. Nielsen Company, one man asked to be removed from the study because "whatever he watched suddenly turned up in the TV Guide," and he simply didn't want to be responsible for the power. </P>





<P>Of course, Nielsen does not actually cancel the show. The networks use Nielsen's viewer ratings to determine whether the show is profitable based on its production costs versus the amount of advertising the network can sell on the show. And shows with millions of viewers can be cancelled due to high production costs or lack of advertiser interest in the show's demographics. After all, television is not there for entertainment or enlightenment. It's there to make money.</P>





<P>Measurement devices include everything from a simple diary filled out daily by members of the household to electronic TV-top meters that automatically record when your set is on and what it's tuned to--then downloads information in the middle of the night to a central computer via modem.</P>





<P>And if that weren't Big Brother enough, Nielsen is currently testing a 
futuristic Passive People Meter technology. This TV-top device contains digitized facial features of every member of the family so it can "recognize" who's in the room without ever touching it. Spooky.</P>





<P>While you can't volunteer to be a Nielsen family, you should 
jump at the chance if A.C. Nielsen ever calls. Someday we may be able to credit you with saving us from the likes of the Olsen twins or Joey Lawrence.</P>





<P><I>The author participated in the Nielsen survey in 1989. He swears he watched all the good shows; blame his roommates for shows like Hard Copy and Full House.</I></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>S</FONT>ome movies achieve cult status. Others have cult status thrust upon them. You know when you're watching a cult classic, of course. For starters, everyone you know has seen the movie before you--and they've seen it two or three times. They've also memorized all the great lines. And they've told you so much about the movie that by the time you get around to watching it yourself, certain scenes seem strangely "familiar." Here are three flicks that have either made it to culthood or are awful damn close. </P>





<P><I>"Where does he find this stuff"</I></P>




<P><B>Marathon Man</B> 1976 Lawrence Olivier, Dustin Hoffman, Roy Scheider 126 min. Color. "Iz it ssssafe," hisses Olivier in the role that will have you asking for your dentist's credentials at your next office visit. Hoffman stars as a grad student accidently caught up in a web of intrigue as Nazi war criminals hunt for a fortune in stolen war diamonds. Olivier works his magic like you've never seen before as the evil Nazi dentist/torturer who's bent on making Hoffman spill the beans. Man, my teeth are sweating just thinking about it. </P>





<P>Also with Hoffman: Little Big Man, Midnight Cowboy, Tootsie, Kramer vs. Kramer, Hero, Outbreak (stinker). </P>






<P><I>Cult Classics</I></P>




<P><B>Blade Runner</B> 1982 Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young 117 min. Color. Director Ridley Scott's masterpiece about an ex-detective who's threatened out of retirement by his former boss to hunt down vicious genetically engineered humans of superior strength and intelligence called "Replicants" in 2019 Los Angeles. But as he terminates these Replicants one by one he begins to question who is human and who is not. Visually breathtaking without the multi-billion dollar budgets of Schwarzenegger movies. Remarkably acted by then no-name people like Hauer, Young and even Darryl Hannah. I highly recommend the director's cut without the bothersome voice-over by Harrison Ford, but the original is also great. Also watch for the cool symbolism of Gaffe's origami throughout the movie. Screenplay based on incredible Philip Dick novel ("Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep") who also wrote Total Recall.</P>





<P>Also by Scott: Alien, Thelma & Louise, Legend</P>






<P><I>"Remember this?"</I></P>




<P><B>Better Off Dead</B> 1985 John Cusack, David Ogden Stiers, Kim Darby 98 min. Color. Poor Cusack is dumped by his girl, terrorized by the family paperboy and singing hamburgers (yes, hamburgers) and is ignored by his folks. No wonder he feels he'd be better off dead in this offbeat, sometimes totally bizarre comedy. While this movie merely mimics John Hughes' style, it is by far one of the funniest of the 80s coming-of-age movies. </P>





<P>Also with Cusack: One Crazy Summer, Say Anything, The Grifters</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4>S</FONT>ome people would rather drive off a cliff than shop for auto insurance. The whole concept is depressing (my god, bodily injury!). The language and actuarial science can be confusing. And insurance ain't free.</P>





<P>"It's not easy to understand," admits insurance agent Jim Beehler. "Sometimes I've been confused by the thing."
</P>




<P>Finding the best policy doesn't have to be an awful experience, insists Beehler, and a careful consumer can find terrific bargains. Calling insurance companies and getting great rates is easier "once you have a basic understanding of what the coverages are and you know what terms like bodily injury and property damage mean," says Beehler.</P>

<IMG WIDTH=126 HEIGHT=351 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="coverage1a.gif">



<P><B>Bodily Injury Liability</B></P>





<P>You'll usually see a pair of numbers divided by a slash in the policy. It might be "100/300," for example. In that case, the insurance company will pay up to $100,000 per person for bodily injury caused by your accident, or up to $300,000 total to everyone in the other car, says Beehler.</P>





<P><B>Property Damage Liability</B></P>





<P>This is another of those "splits." If the policy reads 100/300/100, the first two numbers are for bodily injury, the third property damage. It means your policy will cover up to $100,000 of property damage you cause in an accident. "Generally it's another car," says Beehler, "but every once and a while a car jumps a curb and hits a building."</P>





<P>The required minimum amount of coverage for both bodily injury and property damage liability vary from state to state, according to Beehler.</P>





<P><B>Medical Payments</B></P>





<P>These figures apply to the policy holder and his passengers. The company will pay up to the amount in the policy per person in the vehicle. The numbers typically range from $5,000 to $100,000 or more.
</P>


<B>Comprehensive</B>



<P>Fire, theft, wind damage, a deer caught in your headlights, a tree falling on your car, the effects of the Jonestown Flood. "Say a rock is thrown up and breaks your windshield," says Beehler. "That's comprehensive."</P>





<P><B>Collision</B></P>





<P>As the name suggests, collision is all about hittin' or gettin' hit. It includes everything from cars to shopping carts. Shopping carts? "It happens a lot in mall parking lots," says Beehler.</P>





<P>Comprehensive and collision coverage typically involves deductibles. If your policy calls for a $500 deductible and the appraised damage to your car is $2,000, you pay $500 and the insurance company agrees to pay the rest.</P>





<P><B>Uninsured Motorist Coverage</B></P>





<P>This protects you in the event your car is hit and/or you're injured by a driver without insurance. "It usually matches the bodily injury liability limits," says Beehler.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>E</FONT>ach month The Glue Factory is devoted to covering topics that relate to keeping your car properly maintained and (nearly) hassle free. If you have questions about auto maintenance, send them to  <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">us</A>.  </P>










<P><B>Question:</B> My tires are losing traction and are getting pretty bald, but I don't have $300 to $500 to put four new tires on my car. What can I do before I get a flat that leaves me stranded?</P>









<P><B>Answer:</B> New tire prices can be intimidating and cost nearly as much as a month's rent. If you are looking for a good set of tires that will get you by for a year or so, then look into used tires. At many junk yards, gas stations and some tire dealerships, you can find a lot of tires with 50-to-90 percent of the tread left on them. It is not uncommon to replace all four tires for less than $100.</P>





<P>Although used tires are a bargain, there are some things you need to do before buying.</P>





<P>1. Visually inspect the tires for bulges, patches or cracking. Then run your hand across the tire to feel for unevenness. 
</P>




<P>2. Look for uneven wear. The best way to check is to bring along a penny. Place the penny between the tread on one side of the tire and mark with your thumb how deep the penny is into the tread. Then do the same with the other side of the tire. Make sure there is not a lot of difference between the depth on each side. </P>





<P>3. Check the inside of the tire to see if there is ground-up rubber. Shavings inside a tire indicate it was driven when it was flat.</P>





<P>According to one mechanic: "I found a set of four used tires for my truck and have driven 35,000 miles on them. I only paid $40 for all four."</P>








<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="gluepic1.jpeg"><BR>
<B>Quick Tip:</B> The string of numbers on the side of the tire refer to its size. For example, 205/55R15 S means: 205--the cross-secion width of the tire in millimeters, 55--the Aspect ratio of the height to width, and 15-- the diameter of the rim in inches. The letter crammed in between the numbers refers to Radial Construction. The letter at the end refers to the highest speed a tire is designed to go. The letter designation's top speed, in miles per hour (mph) is: S--112 mph, T--118 mph, U--124 mph, H--130 mph, V--149 mph, Z--over 149 mph.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

<P>So you've found what may be your next car and it's used. Before you drive into the sunset with the wind blowing through your hair, you need to carefully examine the car first.</P>






<P>We spoke with LemonBusters of Texas and Lemon Aid of Pennsylvania, two professional used car inspection services, about how to inspect a used car for potential signs of wear, tear, and damage. </P>


<IMG  SRC="lookpic1.jpeg" ALIGN=RIGHT>


<P>Before you begin any inspection, make sure that a "Buyer's Guide" is displayed on the car if it is at a dealer. Federal law requires dealers to display the "Buyer's Guide" sticker to give buyers the warranty information. Read it carefully, because in many states the words "as is" declares a denial of warranty coverage, according to Consumer Reports.</P>





<P>If the car is from a private seller, ask for the service records, repair bill, or warranty information. If they look perplexed or can't show any documentation you may want to begin looking elsewhere for a used car.</P>


<P>If you're satisfied with the information you have gotten so far, it's time to begin a thorough inspection of the vehicle.</P>





<B><P>Start the engine<BR></B>

Begin by starting the car and letting it run during the entire time you're checking things out.</P>





<P>"Sometimes people will try to mask engine problems by putting very heavy oil in the engine to quite it down," said Greg Geske of Lemon Aid. "You will be able to hear any problems by letting it run for a while."</P>





<P>Some sounds such as ticking may indicate stuck valves or lifters, and a knocking sound could be more severe.</P>





<B><P>Get inside<BR></B>

Go over every inch of the interior of the car. If there is a button or switch use it and check for and any signs of water stains or moisture. Explaining to a cop you bought this car and didn't know the brake lights were out may not get you out of a ticket.</P>




<B><P>Under the hood<BR></B>

Check all of the fluids and look for any leaks. This includes the oil, transmission, radiator (shut engine off for this and let it cool down), power steering, and brake fluids.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG WIDTH=260 HEIGHT=157  SRC="officehead.gif"></P><BR>



<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>here is no hell quite like an office where everyone hates each other. No cheerful "good morning" by the communal Mr. Coffee. Whispering cliques abound. Bosses preach teamwork in quiet meetings but practice favoritism when it counts. Anger and resentment, the twin viruses that kill productivity, thrive under weak, disinterested or incompetent management.</P>





<P>Hank Miller has heard all the nightmarish stories. As a manager of staff training, Miller leads workshops for university employees on workplace violence. His three-hour sessions are designed to "sensitize supervisors to violence early warning signals," but his experience in human resources has taught him that things don't have to reach that extreme before an office suffers emotionally.</P>


<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="scream.jpeg">


<P>"We need to communicate," says Miller. "Teamwork is more important than ever and so is group interaction. It's more important that people communicate and be open with each other."</P>





<P>Miller says "supervisors can control situations before they get out of hand," but that's assuming the supervisors aren't the cause of the problem. "That can be a little more difficult," he adds. "There are people who are technically proficient but who haven't been adequately trained in interpersonal skills or dealing with subordinates."</P>





<P>Like most HR personnel, Miller prefers "more informal" ways of correcting problems or dealing with the inevitable clash of personalities. "You need open communication to clear the air," he says.</P>





<P>Any company that believes all its internal squabbles are self-correcting is asking for disintegrating employee morale. Imagine a carpeted gulag full of brooding young malcontents, bitter mid-level managers stuck in office purgatory, and abusive bosses who openly pit workers against each other in almost gladiatorial battle.</P>





<P>Smart companies have grievance processes in place where employees can "go through the channels all the way through to arbitration, if that's necessary," says Miller. If the problem is with the boss, though, employees need to think long and hard. "It's a natural inclination that people would be apprehensive about going to a supervisor with problems with that supervisor."</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>M</FONT>anagement had just sent us an e-mail with a solution to a small problem--the over-packed company refrigerator.  Employees had been abusing the appliance by storing a week's worth of lunches, causing a tidal wave of culinary delectables to spew forth upon any unsuspecting boob who tried to retrieve his/her own lunch.</P>


<IMG SRC="conform.jpeg" ALIGN=RIGHT>


<P>"Each employee from now on will be assigned to clean out the refrigerator at the end of each week. If you cannot make your scheduled clean-out time, it is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIND A REPLACEMENT.  That is all," the company e-mail read.</P>





<P>Having never used the fridge, I was perturbed.  Management had already changed our dress code from "business casual" to "professional" (even as most companies were going the opposite direction); our phone calls had just begun to be monitored; and we had each been assigned our own personal KGB agent to watch over us like a BIG BROTHER. Re-education camps, I was convinced, were on their way. The new Fridge policy simply added to the frustration.</P>





<P>I wrote a reply e-mail to the activities coordinator saying that I took exception to the policy. My argument was that the masses should not have to be penalized for the irresponsibility of a few employees. I had never used the fridge, so why did I have to clean up after the big babies who did?</P>





<P>I found out later that it was my supervisor who had suggested the policy. She said she was "livid" when she read the e-mail I had sent.  How dare I defy her?  How dare I question her policy?  Despite just recently being commended for my efforts supporting two account reps and after having been described as "an asset," suddenly I was not a "team player" because I disagreed with the "Frigidare Mandate."</P>





<P>Never again will I speak my mind. Never again will I question the policies of others, be it large or be it small. Yes, ma'am, whatever you say, ma'am. May I interest you in a four-year-old frozen dinner, ma'am?</P>





<P>Conformity. What a wonderful choice.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>"W</FONT>e're going ballistic, Mav!" screamed Anthony Edwards in Top Gun, the movie that made tens of thousands of people want to climb into an F-14 and tear through the sky. </P>





<P>"Most people start in a Cessna 152," says flight instructor Mikel May. This small, lightweight plane with its wings strapped to the roof and its propeller dutifully pulling passengers through the air, is reminiscent of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. But that's where you start if you want to learn to fly.</P>





<P>"The first time you take a lesson, you'll go up in the air," says May. At some point during the flight, the hard-plastic, u-shaped controls to the airplane are handed over to you. Along with the combined fear and exhilaration, you'll experience the pulling, bouncing and gnawing vibrations of a plane that has no first-class section. But you'll have control.</P>





<P>It's your introductory flight, the initial step to getting a private pilot's license, and the wind roars as it rushes past the thin metal doors. The unexpected bump and jolt as the little plane chops it way into the sky sharpens your senses, unlike the numbness you passively receive in a massive airliner. </P>


<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="plane1.jpeg">


<P>You're in control as the ground shrinks beneath you and the sky opens up. When you take the controls, you're absorbing each sensation, additional knowledge for a license that will allow you to rent or own an airplane and fly by yourself in good weather, day or night. You'll be able to take passengers, but you can't be hired as a pilot.</P>





<P>The path you'll follow to your license follows strict guidelines set by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>


<UL>
<LI>Complete a minimum of 40 hours of flight time of which 20 hours are solo and 20 hours you'll have an instructor by your side.

<LI>Pass the private pilot written, oral and flight test.

<LI>Be at least 17 years old.

<LI>Pass a third class medical examination.
</UL>



<P>"With each lesson you'll fly," says May. "The instructor is there to correct the student's mistakes." Although correcting your mistakes may take more than 40 hours of instruction.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>he following text is taken from a commencement address by Wally Booger, chief executive officer of Booger Industries, to graduates of Minutia State College in Mucus, Kansas:</P>





<P>"It's a pleasure to be back on the Minutia campus. As you know, I spent my undergrad years here, the best years of my life. Excuse me if I get choked up. I always get a lump in my throat when I think of Mucus.</P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="brain.jpeg">





<P>I learned the value of little things at Minutia. For example, I appreciate the little people upon whose backs my fortune was made. If it weren't for little people like you, I wouldn't be able to make the generous tax-deductible donations that built Booger Arena, Booger Stadium and the Booger Food Court in the student union.</P>





<P>Most of you are wondering what the future holds. I wish I could tell you. I can tell you that a million-dollar donation gets you an honorary degree, a distinguished alumnus award and a lot of sucking up from the college administration. You'll never know that feeling.</P>





<P>You want jobs after college. Well, my company is always hiring. We're always hiring because we're always firing and laying off people. I can't explain why we have such turnover, but it might have something to do with our low salaries and the demeaning way we treat employees. It's earned us an awful reputation, but we've taken steps to change that by increasing the public relations budget and contributing more to the United Way. We don't pay our employees any more than we did in the past, of course, but we can hardly give them all decent raises and still pay me my $2.3 million a year.</P>





<P>What am I looking for in a kid fresh out of college? Brains. Big brains. My company is noted for hiring intelligent young people and then working them to death, ridiculing their ideas before adopting them as our own, and driving them nuts with promises of bonuses and raises before announcing cutbacks. It takes brains just to make it through the three-month probation.</P>





<P>Let me vaporize any dreams you might have of building a career with my company. Nobody in middle management can serve as your mentor because we sawed off those dead limbs in the last downsizing wave. And nobody wants you hanging around long enough to earn a respectable salary. You don't put in 30 years at Booger. That's not good business.</P>





<P>Why do we treat our people this way? Because we know there's always another freckle-faced graduate willing to suffer the pathetic pay and office politics. Many of you will gladly work for me--and endure the abuse.</P>





<P>Want some advice? Read newspapers and magazines. Learn which companies treat their employees with dignity and respect. Take an active role in your career and don't let bosses like me ruin your life. And always update your resume the week after you accept a new job.</P>





<P>Finally, I know none of you have listened to a word I've said. Congratulations, good luck to you all and don't forget to stop by our booth at tomorrow's job fair. Remember our motto: At Booger, we pick you."</P>

<P><IMG WIDTH=41 HEIGHT=60 ALT="T"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tdrop.gif">he ads and infomercials promise easy money for little work and minimal investment. Some of them are legitimate business deals, some are outright ripoffs. Many straddle the ethical-legal line. Nearly all of them can leave an unsuspecting individual with third-degree burns.</P>





<P>You've seen the ads. Often tucked away in the employment section of newspaper classifieds or near the back of cheap supermarket tabloids, the ads suggest thousands--even millions--of dollars can be made working part time out of the home. "Learn the secrets that made me a millionaire!" is a common claim. You won't learn those secrets for free, of course. You have to buy the book, kit, audio or video tapes. They're not cheap.</P>





<P>Nobody knows exactly how many people fall prey to these job or investment scams every year. An investigator with a state attorney general's office said many people would rather forget the experience and right off their lost investment rather than admit they bought the exaggerated claims of a fly-by-night outfit. Who wants to admit they're a sucker?</P>





<P>Even victims who seek justice will have a difficult time. "The laws are there and they can be enforced," says law professor James P. Nehf., "but the first problem is finding the perpetrator." There are consumer protection laws in every state, but the con artists and grifters seldom have a permanent address; they often rely on mail drops and post office boxes, travel frequently and change company names when they fear the law approaching.</P>





<P>To make matters worse, "consumer fraud is never very high on a state legislator's agenda," says Nehf. "It's not a high enough priority to get legislation that's helpful." Victims are not "getting ripped off for thousands and thousands of dollars, they're getting ripped off for a few hundred dollars."</P>





<P>That can be very frustrating to a person who hoped an ad might pave the way to riches--or at least provide the lucrative second income needed to get out of debt. "It's as if there's nothing you can do. To have a legal remedy but not be practically able to pursue it, it's like there's no remedy at all," says Nehf.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><IMG WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=54 ALT="O" ALIGN=LEFT SRC="odrop.gif">n the side of a dark highway. It's raining. Life's hell if you're forced to work on your car.  Your hand slips as you try to wrench a lug nut off a wheel. The image of Bill Bixby races thorugh your mind. His eyes glaze over, his shirt rips open and he becomes the steroid-engorged Incredible Hulk.  <A HREF="/movnsound/angry.wav">"You wouldn't like me when I'm angry."</A> (79k "Incredible" wav file.)</P>

  



<P>"The key to avoiding a road-side emergency is preventative maintenance," says Doug Smith, the manager of automotive services at a AAA regional office. According to Smith, there are several little visual things you can do to help.</P>

 



<P>"Start by checking your tires for signs of damage and correct air pressure. Also, inspect the engine for cracked hoses, worn belts, low oil and make sure your coolant is full," says Smith. But even the most intense inspections may not keep you from reaching your final destination carefree. That's when you're forced to become a road-side mechanic--and your chances of pulling the job off successfully improve dramatically if you have the right tools.</P>





<P>There's some basic equipment everyone should have in their car, and it's not as expensive as finding a phone and calling someone to fix things for you. "I get a milk carton and put everything in there, and then strap it into my trunk with a bungee cord," says Smith.</P>





<P>Here are the essentials to stock your milk carton up with according to Smith:</P>





<P><UL>
<LI>A flare or orange triangle to warn others that you're stranded on the side of the road.
<LI>Extra antifreeze in case you lose all of your coolant.
<LI>A quart of oil, because as the heat rises on the road your oil becomes thinner and could become low on a long trip.
<LI>A bottle of transmission fluid. If the transmission starts to slip because you are running low on fluid, this will prevent serious damage. 
<LI>Some shop rags or old rags to clean up with after you are done working on your car.
<LI>A flashlight for working in the dark, especially under the hood.
<LI>Bottled water so you don't overheat, and you can mix the water with the antifreeze to thin it out and make it last longer.
<LI>Crackers or a candy bar. You may be there for a while.
</UL></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>E</FONT>ach month The Glue Factory covers topics designed to help you keep your car properly maintained and (nearly) hassle free. If you have questions about auto maintenance, send them to <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">Enter</A>.</P>


 
 

<P><B>Question:</B>  I'm driving a used car and have no idea when the air conditioning was last recharged. How much can I expect to pay?</P>


 
 

<P><B>Answer:</B>  As long as you think your AC adequately cools your car, leave it alone. Unless there's a leak or seepage, most cars can go years before the AC needs recharging.</P>


 
 

<P>"I know people with '87 and '88 cars and they've never touched it," says Mike Bunch, a service manager. "If it's cold every year, there's no point in checking it. It's one of those things that if it's not broke don't fix it."</P>


 
 

<P>Standard AC draws hot air from the outside and cools it with a chemical before releasing the chilled air in the car. Depending on the make and model, you should feel a temperature change in 15 to 30 seconds. Service technicians check the AC's cooling ability by inserting what looks like a meat thermometer in one of the centerally located vents for a minute or two. Bunch says the temp should run 42 to 48 degrees.</P>


 
 

<P>Costs will vary around the country, but Bunch says labor at his shop will be about $40. Typical jobs require between two and four pounds of chemical coolant. One chemical is R12, commonly called Freon. Freon is a mixture of fluorine, carbon and usually chlorine and has been determined to damage the Ozone layer. Its price has skyrocketed lately and now runs about $25.50 a pound. "Supply and demand is driving prices up," says Bunch.</P>


 
 
 

<P>Freon's chemical cousin, the more environmentally friendly R134A, costs less than $20 in some places. Bunch sells it for $18.75.</P>


 
 

<P>Eventually all cars will use R134A. Drivers won't be switching from one chemical to another, however. "It's not going to be as simple as that," warns Bunch. Some cars will require adjusting of some fittings before going to the new chemical; it'll cost about the same as a recharging. Others, though, will need parts of the system replaced, and that could be $300 to $400 or more.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Heather Brophy</A></P>

<BR>


<P><IMG WIDTH=53 HEIGHT=50 ALT="W"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="wdrop.gif">ith 7,000 volunteers serving in 93 countries, a lot of people apparently love the "the toughest job you'll ever love," the Peace Corps, the number one employer of college graduates.</P>





<P>Many people envision a hut deep in a Third World forest when they think of the Peace Corps. But today a volunteer is just as likely to live in an apartment building and work in an office complete with phones and computers. For thirty-five years the United States has been sending volunteers to countries to help share technical knowledge as well as build understanding between countries. </P>

 



<P>While being a volunteer is not the most financially rewarding position--you will  earn mere peanuts--it does offer an opportunity to gain international experience, technical skills and, in most cases, a new language. Plus, you will have an advantage in getting federal government employment later. It even lets you put off the "real world" a little while longer. Experience of a lifetime--<IMG WIDTH=227 HEIGHT=219 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="peace1.gif">travel, adventure, helping others--what else could you want? But is it the career move to make? And how difficult is it to join?</P>





<P>Only four out of every 10 applicants are invited to serve. The first step to joining the Peace Corps is to get an application. Call or write the Peace Corps office, or visit their web page and ask for one to be sent to you. By the end of the summer you will even be able to download it from the web page. The application is long and Michael Wiedel, recruitment coordinator of the Chicago regional  office, suggests filling it out in detail and spending a lot of time on it.</P>





<P>"We're looking for interest and knowledge--through volunteering and education--that qualify (the applicant) for a position," says Wiedel.</P>





<P>Most volunteers work in four basic areas--agriculture, education, health or business. These and related degrees are helpful in obtaining a nomination.  There are also programs which do not require a specific degree but are based on work or volunteer experience. Teaching a vocational trade like carpentry is one example. Other experiences and certifications can also help so be sure to include CPR training and that vegetable garden you had last summer. Language skills are also a bonus, especially French and Spanish. While a college degree is not required, most volunteers are college graduates. And you must be at least 18 and a US citizen.</P>





<P>The next step is an interview, done either by phone or in person at a regional office or college campus. Two soon-to-be volunteers both felt face-to-face interviews were better.</P>





<P>Colleen Turner went to Chicago for her interview. She felt it gave her a chance to connect with her interviewer. She also felt she had more time with her interviewer compared to friends who interviewed on campus.</P>



<P>Throughout his application, Ahmad Ali never saw or spoke in person with anyone. Instead, he conducted his interview over the phone through the Dallas regional office while he lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico. While he was nominated, he felt a face-to-face interview would have given him a chance to really show his recruiter why he wanted to join the Corps.</P>





<P>Wiedel says recruiters are looking for someone committed and patient, with strong leadership skills as well as specific skills that qualify her or him for a  position.</P>





<P>Patricia Garamendi, associate director of recruitment, agrees the Peace Corps wants motivated, committed people with cross-cultural sensitivity because "all the skills in the world don't do any good without cross-cultural sensitivity." She says if you don't qualify for a position due to a lack of experience, you can work with the recruiter by doing some volunteer work--like six months of ESL (English as a Second Language) tutoring--to qualify for a position.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Jeff Morris</A></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=4>SCENE:</FONT> A balmy afternoon in New York City. Max (played by James Spader) 
has traveled several hundred miles from St. Louis and is about to enter 
the restaurant to reunite with his love, Nora (played by 
Susan Sarandon). He hesitates, then quickly ducks inside.</P>





<P>"Cut! You. Yes you, in the red shirt. Could you come out of the shop 
just a little sooner?"</P>





<P><IMG WIDTH=280 HEIGHT=238 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="crowd.gif">My big acting debut. For $25 a day, I had spent weeks just standing 
around drinking coffee, watching the action and waiting to be called. 
Only to be reduced to "you in the red shirt." But I couldn't be more 
thrilled. I was a movie extra in the feature film <I>White Palace</I>. Of 
course, when the movie hit the big screens, my celluloid debut (it was 
actually shot in the Central West End in St. Louis) didn't make it. Lost 
on the cutting room floor, as they say in the biz. I never even met any 
stars.</P>





<P>So how did I get there? A friend had heard about a cattle call audition 
on the evening news. We went, spent several hours in a cramped 
auditorium, filled out reams of paper, then went home to await our call 
to stardom.</P>





<P>According to Judy Welker, one of the midwest's premier casting 
directors, it sometimes happens that way. But only when vast numbers of 
people are needed. Like the cheering crowds in the movie <I>Hoosiers</I>. In 
New York or L.A. you can scour the ads in <I>Daily Variety</I> or the 
<I>Hollywood Reporter</I> for cattle calls, but most Hollywood casting 
directors won't even consider you unless you're with a Hollywood agent.</P>

 


<P>The midwest, however, is a different story. </P>





<P>"Many studios are now shooting in the midwest because [production] is 
cheaper, but also because the talent here are real people," says 
Welker, "so I don't necessarily look for people who are trained in 
acting because chances are that's not what the [studio] producer is 
looking for."</P>





<P>How do you become a movie extra? Try to arrange an appointment 
with a casting director like Welker, who operates Artistic Enterprises Midwest Casting. She keeps a database of 
profiles and photos that she calls upon when the Hollywood studios 
call upon her. Because of her busy schedule, it's tough to meet her and 
there's no guarantee you'll get any auditions. It all depends on her 
unique feel for the character and whether you fit that part. For 
example, the boy Welker cast in the part of a young Babe Ruth in 
<I>The Babe</I> had heard about the casting on the radio, visited the local 
library to research Ruth, then impressed Welker with his genuine 
personality. He ended up being the only child on the audition tape sent 
to Universal Studios.</P>





<P>According to Welker, these success stories sometimes feed local 
scams. "People hear these stories and think they can do it too. I always 
warn people to be very careful about answering newspaper ads. I rarely 
use advertising. I rely on my database. And I get paid by the studios, 
so I don't charge for auditions. There should never be a fee for 
auditions."</P>





<P>"Being an extra is a tough job for not much pay," says Welker. I 
couldn't agree more. "Excuse me, Mr. Coppola, what's my motivation for 
exiting this store?"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>W</FONT>henever you feel like you're neck deep in crap at work, remember that it could be worse. In 1984, my dad talked the Montpelier, Ohio, (population 4,000) Village  Administrator, a friend of the family, into hiring me to operate the town's sewer jetter for college tuition money.</P> 



<P>Now this is basically the Terminator of garden hoses. Spraying water at 2,500  p.s.i., this puppy could cut a puppy in half. This would be reeled through a sewer  and actually slice through all the roots, armpit hair and butt fritters built up in  the line.  </P>





<P>Anyway, a couple of weeks before I was to start <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="postaltoon.jpeg">work, the sewer jetter got stuck at  the very end of the village's sewer line. We would have to bring in a backhoe from  nearby Toledo to dig out the line. Bureaucracy being what it is, this process would  take almost two weeks.</P>

  



<P>Two days into my new job, I was lowered into a pit and ordered to open the clay  tiles and free the sewer jetter. Looking back, I should have questioned why my dad  was summoned to the site that day. I should have recognized the snickering behind  gloved hands. I should have considered the hip waders I wore and the casual  warnings that I may end up slogging around in the chunky remains of Montpelier's  collective dinner from the previous night. </P>

 



<P>What happened next will be retold among crews of the Montpelier city works for  generations, causing laughter so hard their lunchtime Spam sandwiches will spray out their noses.</P>

  



<P>After a tentative tap with a sledgehammer, I reeled back and struck the tiles with a  fierce blow. Two weeks of Montpelier's pressurized excrement exploded in my face.  Within seconds my hip waders were full of bowel gravy. Shrieking like a  five-year-old school girl, I clawed at the sides of the pit begging to be pulled  out. Everyone was laughing so hard their faces looked like over-ripe tomatoes  peering down into the pit. Tears rolled down my own father's face as he struggled  to catch his breath. </P>

 



<P>Incredibly, I was then forced to lean over and free the sewer jetter, sewer bass floating precariously close to my chin. Only then was I released so dad could haul me home in the back of the pickup and make me strip so he could hose me down on the back patio. After that, lunch was served. I think I had rump roast.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="ydrop.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="Y">our resume might be strong, your references top-notch. But if your cover letter is full of mistakes, you can forget landing an interview with most companies. One personnel director put it this way: "You want to make a favorable impression. Don't look stupid."</P>





<P>The cover letter is your introduction to a company. It needs to make an immediate impact. A cover letter is nothing more than a standard business letter that states in a few words why you should be hired. The letter should compliment the resume, not copy it. According to Sara Veatch, an associate relations manager, "you have to come up with something that makes a company want to talk to you." </P>





<P>Many companies are besieged with applicants for open positions, and your cover letter may only get a brief glance initially, making it important to clearly define in the opening statement what position you are applying for and where and when you saw the position advertised. "The first thing I do is look for a cover letter, then I scan it to see what position they are applying for," says Veatch. "I get a lot of resumes that don't have them (cover letters) at all, and that is a negative."</P>





<P>How important is a cover letter to getting an interview? Veatch says the cover letter accounts for about 25 percent of the overall package. Without a cover letter you're already starting with a "C" average when competition for jobs commonly knocks "A" applicants out of the running. "It (the cover letter) is going to tell me how well you write, how you put sentences together, and it's going to give me an idea of your personality," says Veatch.</P>

 



<P>Always sign your cover letter. And never misspell the name of the person who'll be getting the letter. Either mistake can kill any chance for an interview.</P>

 



<P>Applicants should personalize each cover letter. Address the letter to a specific person. Even if a classified ad lists only the name and department of a company, job applicants should take the initiative and call the company to get the name of the person receiving the resume and letter. Joseph P. Goodwin, an assistant director of career services, advises against using "Dear Employer" or, worse, "Dear Sirs."</P>





<P>Some of these errors are common among applicants who have an all-purpose cover letter stored in a computer or word processor. "It's like, well, 'I'm on their little assembly line,'" says Veatch.</P>





<P>Goodwin agrees. "If the person is using a standard cover letter from a word processor, tailor the letter to the position," says Goodwin, who thought of several instances where applicants failed to update existing computer files and sent cover letters to, say, a human resources person at Bowling Green but the letter's salutation was to a person at Eastern Michigan.</P>


 


<P>"Mistakes are common to all categories," says Goodwin. "New grads or experienced job seekers, we see the same mistakes across the board." Slipshod editing has killed many otherwise strong cover letters. Goodwin says people rely too heavily on the spelling features of computers and word processors, which are notorious for having difficulty differentiating between certain words. "Have it proofread," he suggests.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=46 ALT="L"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ldrop.gif">ook at any magazine, or watch TV and you'll see that human beings, must be pretty foul creatures. It seems we emit smells that offend anyone in our immediate vicinity. For years, Madison Avenue targeted the self-consciousness of consumers by advertising the "latest" or "newest" cure for one of these problems, bad breath.</P>


	


<P>For years, the prescribed cure for bad breath was brushing and using mouthwash (you decide - "mediciney" or "minty"). Dr. Howard Smith's Fresh Breath and Dr. Harold Katz's California and New York Breath Centers have grabbed a lot of media attention in the less than three years that they have been in existence. According to Dr. Katz, "The demand for our services has stunned us. We have successfully treated over 3,000 people since we started. In 1995 alone, we received over 10,000 inquiries [and] the number grows exponentially daily."</P>


	


<P>Halitosis, as the condition is formally known as, afflicts a wide spectrum of people. Dr. Katz estimates about 20 percent of the general population has this condition, with most of his patients falling in the 25-75 year old range. "However, we have seen patients as young as six, and as old as 86. It is evenly distributed between the sexes." says Katz "As far as socio-economic or other determinants, we have attorneys, bank presidents, physicians, computer <IMG WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=289 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="breath3.gif"> executives, teachers, scientists, etc. as patients. We also have dentists who have come to us for this problem." This condition is truly an "equal opportunity problem" Katz says.</P>


	


<P>Dr. Smith agrees that the condition is not limited to any single social or biological constraint, but he has found that "it has been our experience that middle-aged females are most likely to seek treatment, perhaps more so because of the social ramifications of living with this condition." Both doctors report requests for help and information from around the world.</P>


	


<P>Opinions for treatment vary. The toothpaste and mouthwash manufacturers continue to push their products, but the latest research is showing that these products have limited effects, and in some cases may only exacerbate the problem. Mouthwashes that contain alcohol will cause the mouth to dry out, one of the causes of halitosis. Dr. Katz recommends sufferers of this condition avoid alcohol, "whether it says Budweiser or Listerine on the label."</P>


	


<P>According to Dr. Smith, "80 percent of bad breath originates from the mouth, and 80 percent of these cases originate from the back of the tongue." He attributes this to numerous causes, including "poor oral hygiene, a diet that includes spicy foods, or dishes with a lot of garlic, onions or different cultural spices; a poor diet [lacking] the proper foods from the suggested food groups; not enough liquid intake (i.e. water); medications that tend to cause a dry mouth; and lastly, different systemic conditions which may lead to bad breath, such as infections in the lungs, stomach ulcers, or upper airway infections."</P>


	


<P>The actual odor can be attributed to "anaerobic bacteria that are located on the back of the tongue, and in the throat," Katz says. He adds that these bacteria are not "infectious or bad bacteria," but actually have a function in the digestion of food particles, "particularly proteins, by breaking them down into smaller chemical units, so that the digestion process is assisted."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>S</FONT>everal Web sites bit the dust today. Several more will disappear tomorrow. Cyberspace is as cold and unforgiving as space itself, and surfers are cautioned not to blink lest their favorite pages vanish without warning or without so much as a fractured atom to prove they once existed.</P>





<P>That's reality in an unreal world. Could it be the birth of a medium is not unlike the birth of a universe? If so, is it possible  <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="gravetoon.gif"> we skipped the beauty of creation and went straight to dead stars, lifeless planets and orbiting space junk?</P>




<P>Web Review, like the Utne Lens and other serious journals before it, will be missed. If timing is everything, perhaps these pioneer Net attempts came too early. It isn't easy to appeal to the intellect while the rest of the Web has one hand on the groin. Sadly, they couldn't wait for readers to mature, to outgrow the silly and suggestive.</P>




<P>So they're gone. You can find stuff like Amazing Toenail Clippings or Juanita's Ton O' Breasts Page, but Web Review is gone. Applaud the attempt to resuscitate it, but the effort will likely be as futile as it is noble. It's gone.</P>




<P>Don't blame readers. Afterall, who wants to read when you can download another picture of Pamela Anderson Lee naked? Aint never seen that before! She's hardly ever naked!</P>




<P>And don't blame the countless guides and sites and magazines that select Incredible Hot/Cool/Top Sites of the Day/Hour/Minute. Afterall, they were busy finding such worthwhile nuggets as Atomic Spittle Page or Adventures in Panties. Sometimes they'd go out on a limb and select something outrageous like Tongue, the Web site recently bought out by Giant Conglomerate--a new advertiser. That takes guts.</P>




<P>And please don't blame Web sites like Self Important, the clever site that ridicules other sites for selling out and accepting advertising--until, of course, it started accepting advertising from Giant Conglomerate.</P>




<P>The Public Broadcasting System and National Public Radio can tell you how hard it is to produce meaningful content. They can spank your ears with sorry stories. They know what some people on the Web are just now finding out. Life isn't always fair, especially when you're trying to sell the philharmonic to polka fans.</P>




<P>Like television and radio and print mediums, the Web will have to endure awkward, often ugly periods. Good sites--like good television shows and good newspapers--will die for lack of interest.</P>




<P>They will die because it's not cool to be smart.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>R</FONT>unway modeling career not taking off like you'd hoped? Don't worry. There are other ways to make money in the fashion industry, and Farley Enterprises is one of them. The folks at Farley Enterprises buy and sell vintage clothing. More specifically, they buy vintage American clothing and sell it to vintage retailers in Japan.</P>

  
	

<P>Many of us here in the States buy vintage clothes because we get all the style and pizzazz of the Ropers for the price of a can of cocktail weenies. So you're probably wondering how selling <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="disco.gif">your clothes to a middle man, who exports it overseas to a retailer, is going to land you more than a couple nickels and a Skee-Ball token. Well, lucky for you, the Japanese are pretty serious about their vintage wardrobe.</P>


	

<P>According to Kurt Jensen, operations manager at Farley Enterprises, collecting vintage clothing is more than a fashion statement to the Japanese--it's a hobby. "They study and identify vintage clothes, especially jeans. Many of them can look at a jean and date it. To them, in a lot of ways, vintage clothes are a status symbol," says Jensen.</P>


	

<P>This means there are Japanese out there who are willing to pay serious cash for your hand-me-downs. But you have to have the right stuff. Farley Enterprises is a serious business and they need to satisfy the needs of their customers. For all of you who were hoping to make a quick buck on your third grade Hee-Haw culottes and your lavender legwarmers, you'll need to start planning a garage sale.</P>

 
	

<P>"Some people don't understand why I won't take their vintage clothing items. But I can't sell a retailer stuff that won't sell in his store. That's why we ask for very specific items--items that we know will sell," says Jensen.</P>

 
	

<P>The Japanese are primarily interested in clothing from the '40s to the '70s. But vintage denim is the treasure of choice--especially Wrangler, Lee and Levis. And if they're in good condition, you may be entitled to yen-o-plenty. For example, a pair of Levi's "red lines" in good condition could land you a hundred bucks. There are other gems to be had as well, like vintage Nike shoes, simple print college tees, Windbreakers and military and letterman jackets to name a few.  And for the lucky soul who saved a pair of first edition Air Jordans, you could be $200 richer. If you have a specialty item, you may be able to submit it to the vintage auction where your swank threads go to the highest bidder. (Some couple received a bid of $25,000 for a pair of 1927 vintage Levis in one of these auctions.)</P>


	 

<P>Wondering if you might have some worthy vintage duds? See for yourself on their website. There you'll get valuable information about the ebb and flow of the vintage market. You'll also find a description of their vintage reference guide, <I>Wanted in Japan</I>. According to Jensen, you shouldn't sell so much as a jelly bracelet without this bible of the previously owned.</P>


	 

<P>"<I>Wanted in Japan</I>  is kind of a training manual. It comes out once a year and contains basic vintage information. And it's good no matter who you're selling to. So if you're going to (sell vintage clothing), you'd better have our reference book. If you don't, you'll be at a loss," says Jensen.</P>

 
	

<P>Even if you are at a loss and have never sold a vintage item in your life, you can rest assured that when you deal with Farley Enterprises, you're dealing with honest people. "We have a lot of pride and integrity in our business." says Jensen. "We have no hidden agendas and we're very open with our information. So call right away. I need this stuff."</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Bill Thornbro</A></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>MIAMI</FONT> -- Because the US trade embargo against Cuba is more than 30 years old, a whole generation of smokers in this town have never puffed a good Cuban cigar. They praise the quality and character of cigars they've never tasted.</P>

<P>Laws don't stop smokers from dreaming of forbidden cheroots. Absence makes the heart and lungs grow fonder, it's true. Smuggling is a lucrative enterprise, and somebody always knows somebody who knows somebody, making a box of El Rey del Mundo coronas, while very expensive, a couple of connections away. And there are people in the states who don't mind paying ridiculous bucks for smuggled stogies; the contraband is as much a status symbol as the BMW or Mercedes in the driveway.</P>

<P>That's good news to the profiteers. The thriving black market even includes cigar counterfeiters, a major problem say experts. So while a number of Americans are cheering Cuba's creeping capitalism, there is a dark segment wishing Fidel <IMG WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=56 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="cigar1.gif"> Castro a long and happy life. Their illegal franchise depends on it.</P>

<P>The cigar is a peculiar thing to ponder at a time when cigarette popularity is plummeting. The government's war on tobacco -- and, to be honest, on smokers too -- is white hot. American tobacco companies are under fire, and smokers are treated like Montana militia members should they dare light one up in public.</P>

<P>Curiously, cigar smoking has recently achieved a glamour heretofore unknown. There was a time when the image of the cigar smoker came in two flavors: the fat, heartless Wall Street tycoon or the bewhiskered, often drunk hobo. But the attitude toward affluence changed in the Reagan decade, and younger, sexier celebrities embraced cigar smoking. David Letterman smoked 'em. Jack Nicholson enjoyed a good one. Even supermodels Lauren Hutton and Linda Evangelista appreciate what once was an exclusively masculine habit. Some smart entrepreneur eventually published a slick, classy magazine devoted to cigars and fine living, the oversized Cigar Aficionado. This was acceptance by any standards. Sentiment had shifted. Cigars were hot.</P>

<P>We're not talking about some foul rope and rank wrapper. What America most certainly does not need is a nickel cigar. But timing and luck and some good PR combined to again make fine cigars part of a gentleman's civilized evening.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>O</FONT>h sure, guys like Thanksgiving, Christmas and Valentine's Day, but the 
Fourth of July is definitely a testosterone holiday. It's based on 
killing a bunch of people for freedom. It's celebrated by blowing things 
up. And it's purely American. For example, look what 
Hollywood's serving up on the Fourth of July: <I>Independence Day</I>, that 
glitzy, much-hyped alien takeover flick where we get to watch the White House fumigated for humans. (and who hasn't dreamed of doing that?) Just in case you're not in the mood to fight the holiday crowds at the box office, try blowing some of these out of your local video store.</P>
<BR>




<P><!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4>A</FONT>lien Takeover</P>




<P><B>Starman</B> (1984) Jeff Bridges, Karen Allen, 115 min. Color.
Can we compensate for the testosterone takeover of America in 
Independence Day with a different kind of alien takeover? Bridges 
stars as an alien who crash lands on Earth and takes over a human body 
who just happens to be the dead husband of widow Allen. Even though 
he has all kinds of cool powers, he doesn't blow up anything substantial 
but quickly discovers the best things about being human, like apple pie 
and sex (not at the same time). Bridges and Allen fall in love and 
together must avoid the military in a cross-country chase to return him 
to his people.</P>





<P>Also directed by John Carpenter: <I>Halloween</I>, <I>The Fog</I>, <I>Escape from New 
York</I>, soon-to-be-released <I>Escape from L.A. </I><BR>

<P><B>Apocalypse Now</B> (1979) Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, 153 
min. Color.
Okay, back to the killing. Hey, what did you expect? <I>Born on the Fourth 
of July</I>  ? I'm sorry, I just have a hard time taking Cruise seriously. No 
one looks that pretty after a fire fight. No, if you want a classic war 
film, you have to revisit Francis Ford Coppola's masterful, Academy 
Award winning, Vietnam update of Joseph Conrad's novella <I>Heart of 
Darkness</I>. Army officer Sheen is on a mission to terminate renegade 
colonel Brando in his jungle fortress. Unforgettable battle sequences 
and incredible supporting performances from Duvall, Frederic Forrest and 
Dennis Hopper.</P>





<P>Also with Brando: <I>A Streetcar Named Desire</I>, <I>On The Waterfront</I>, <I>The Wild 
One</I>, <I>Last Tango In Paris</I><BR>

<P><B>Once Upon a Time in America</B> (1984) Robert DeNiro, James Woods, 226 min. 
Color.
Life, liberty and the pursuit of illegal activities. That's America for 
DeNiro and Woods. Sergio Leone (director of spaghetti westerns like <I>A 
Fistful of Dollars</I>  ) brings us his sprawling gangster opus chronicling the 
rise to power of two New York hoods by visiting them at various times in 
their lives from the '20s to the '60s. Incredibly violent, engrossing, 
controversial and long (two tapes), Once Upon A Time also stars Treat 
Williams, Elizabeth McGovern, Burt Young, Tuesday Weld, Danny Aiello and 
Jennifer Connelly in her film debut. </P>





<P>Also with DeNiro: <I>Taxi Driver</I>, <I>The Deer Hunter</I>, <I>Raging Bull</I>, <I>Goodfellas</I>.

<P><FONT SIZE=4>"W</FONT>here does he find this stuff?"</P>




<P><B>Miss Firecracker</B> (1989) Holly Hunter, Tim Robbins, 102 min. Color.
I've probably seen hundreds of films over the years and I could only 
remember one that was set on the Fourth of July. If you love Holly 
Hunter, you'll love this movie. If you don't, you will after this. 
Hunter is the sweet underdog of a small Southern town's annual beauty 
pageant. Playwright Beth Henley (<I>Crimes of the Heart</I> ) adapted her 
acclaimed comedy for screen and introduces us to some unforgettable 
characters played by Mary Steenburgen, Robbins, Alfre Woodard, Amy 
Wright and Trey Wilson.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>When the mail arrives at a company things are usually pretty routine, except this time.</P>





<P><B>9:00 a.m. </B></P>





<P>A small box arrives missing a return address and sent directly to an employee that was leading a nasty lawsuit for our company. Our normally carefree mailroom clerk backed away from the box. The rest of our building unsuspectingly worked away.
</P>




<P><B>9:30 a.m.</B></P>



Still standing about three feet away from what he felt was a bomb our suspicious employee thought it might be time to make someone aware what was in the mailroom. The rest of our building unsuspectingly worked away.



<P><B>10 a.m.</B></P>





<P>Now the president, executive director, recipient of the package, and the mailroom clerk are all standing about three feet away from the box, perplexed about what to do. Guess what? The rest of our building unsuspectingly worked away.</P>





<P><B>10:30 a.m. </B></P>





<P>A phone is placed to the local sheriffs office and the suspicious package remains in the mailroom. And again, the rest of our building unsuspectingly worked away.</P>





<P><B>10:45 a.m. </B></P>





<P>The bomb squad will not be out until later that afternoon. The suspicious package remains in the mailroom and the rest of our building unsuspectingly worked away.</P>






<P><B>3:00 p.m.</B></P>





<P>Rumors begin to float around the building about a potentially explosive situation in the mailroom. "Yeah, right." is the most commonly heard phrase that day and our building worked away.
</P>




<P><B>3:30 p.m.</B></P>





<P>The bomb squad is arriving and an announcement is made that all employees should go home because there may be a bomb in the building.</P>





<P><B>4:00 p.m.</B></P>





<P>The package is placed in a container and exploded. Small pieces of white paper fill the air. </P>





<P><B>4:30 p.m.</B> </P>





<P>A phone call is placed to our insurance company to send more insurance pamphlets and this time please place a return address on the box.         <A HREF="MAILTO:entermag@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG ALT=""I"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="i.jpeg"> knew all along I wanted to be an entertainer of some sort. I liked to sing and I could play guitar," says Ralph, her husky voice a cross between Debra Winger with a sore throat and Kathleen Turner with severe laryngitis. "But we had no money (for college). There was absolutely no cash whatsoever. I didn't think I was gonna go."</P>





<P>Ralph's parents were humble, healthy and very happy, but money was tight. Her brother attended Indiana University on a scholarship, and it was clear Ralph would also need a scholarship. "I was walking down the hallway (at school) and this girl said, 'You know, Ralph, I'm in this pageant and you get scholarships if you win, and I put your name down on an entry form,'" says Ralph.</P>





<P>With little to lose, Ralph entered the contest. Her Mexican-American genes blessed her with stunning features, but Ralph insists the Miss Indiana National Teen-ager pageant was strictly "interview, academic record and talent. No bathing suits."  Ralph won the pageant and a scholarship to Oklahoma City University.</P>

<P>She wants to emphasize the academic nature of the pageant; face and figure weren't factors in her victory. "Dark hair, dark eyes. I stick out," Ralph admits. "But my looks have never been anything but negative for me. Too much attention. It's not wanted."</P>





<P>In other words, guys--</P>





<P>"Or women," Ralph interrupts, but carefully avoids finishing the sentence. "Just too much attention. Not necessarily sexual attention, just too much attention."
</P>




<P>Looks aren't an issue in radio, of course, where she is content to be a disembodied voice. But Ralph likes to perform, and the stage is a powerful magnet. So, beginning in college, she started singing in bar bands. Ralph currently sings with a classic rock/blues  band called Stuck in the Night. Leader and guitarist Don Stuck also is a Q-95 jock, but Ralph is quick to point out these people are serious about their music, that they're not just some DJs from the station who know a couple of chords on the guitar.</P>


<P>In a form-fitting black mini and denim shirt over a tight white top, Ralph looks a bit like Pat Benetar, but that voice sounds like somebody else. Mike in one hand, cigarette in the other, Ralph waits for a guitar solo before she sneaks a slug from a beer bottle she keeps hidden near the drum set. Janis Joplin?
</P>




<P>"No, Janis had great range. A lot better than mine," says Ralph, who obviously has no idea how much range she has.</P>

<IMG ALT="L"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="l2.jpeg">      ocated in an industrial park just off the highway, Climb Time's interior looks like any other warehouse save for the miles of plywood stretching to the ceiling. These boards comprise the climbing surface, and they jut out in a variety of odd, imposing and intimidating angles. Molded grips are scattered in seemingly random fashion on the plywood walls. A four-inch layer of automobile tire chunks surround the walls to cushion the occasional fall.</P>





<P>For a small fee ($16 at Climb Time for gear rental and unlimited daily wall access; prices may vary at different venues around the country), novice climbers can test their skills on the same walls with experienced climbers. A fraternal relationship develops quickly, and it's not unusual to see pros advising beginning climbers. According to Chris Bowman, 21, of York, Pennsylvania, just about anybody can climb indoors.</P>





<P>"My dad's 50 years old and I've got him on the rocks before," says Bowman, president of the Purdue Outing Club, an organization of nearly 300 adventurous members at Purdue University.</P>





<P>Jeff Moll, the 26-year-old owner of Climb Time, smiles, confident that nearly everybody can enjoy his facilities. "Girls and women tend to excel at this sport," Moll says, dispelling the notion that indoor climbing is macho male stuff. Moll explains that women are usually more limber than men, more flexible.</P>

<IMG ALT="After"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="after.jpeg"> determining what you feel you're worth for a position, make sure you know your bottom line. Detail what your expenses are now and the additional costs after accepting a position. These costs could include rent, food, loans, credit cards, clothes for the job, gas to get to work, and lunches out.</P>





<P>"The problem with the college graduate is that $1,000 or $2,000 can make a difference," said Jones. That $1,000 or $2,000 could mean an additional $60 to $120 a month. So try to include costs that may seem insignificant at first but could help get you by in the long run.</P>





<P>Most importantly, according to Beatty, is that you state a salary range as opposed to a figure. This will give you and the interviewer room with which to work.</P>





<P>"Every position has a salary range," said Veatch. Starting your range slightly above what your bottom line is and ending the range about 10 percent above that assures you're asking for an amount you'll need to survive. But if the employer's offer isn't as much as you believe you're worth, are you in a position to negotiate?</P>





<P>"I think there's always room for negotiation," said Veatch. "But I think you need to be realistic."</P>





<P>Being realistic means establishing your value first before you try to negotiate salary, according to Beatty. Furthermore, know the salary range for that position and don't go any higher than 10 percent of what the employer is offering.  
</P>




<P>"Also, being realistic means that sometimes negotiations fall through," said Veatch. </P>





<P>Get a feel for how willing the interviewer is to negotiate and try to weigh the overall picture before you begin to ask for more money. Don't lose sight of what is important to you in the job, and consider what other benefits are involved with the job offer.
</P>




<P>"An average of 30 percent of your salary goes towards benefits," said Jones. </P>





<P>And these benefits are not always apparent at first. Depending on what the employer values, "benefits" could include the work environment, equipment you use, or flexible hours. Take the entire offer into consideration before you ask for the next card in the interviewer's hand.</P>





<P>Interviews will probably always be like a game of cards, but knowing some of the rules to the game could help tip the deck in your favor.         <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/blkend.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 



<B>
<P>What a body<BR></B>

Check out the entire body of the car for dents, dings, mismatched paint, or rust. Areas that are prone to rust are wheel wells, trunk, and under the doors. Stand at each corner of the car and look along the side for any ripples or body panels that don't match. You're looking for signs the car has been in an accident and repaired to look like new.</P>





<B><P>Tires<BR></B>

Make sure there's a spare. Check for uneven tire wear, a signal that the car has been either wrecked or needs an alignment. If the tires are new or bald on a car with 25,000 miles or less it could mean the odometer has been turned back.</P>





<B><P>Suspension<BR></B>

Go to each corner of the car, push down and watch for only one or two bounces; any more and the car may need new shocks or struts. Also, if the car is front-wheel drive check the struts. Struts are behind the front tires and support the wheel. Look for any signs of leaks. Lastly, push and pull on the top of each front tire. If there is any movement it may mean bad bearings or suspension joints.</P>





<B><P>Let's go driving<BR></B>

If you're satisfied with all of your inspections, thoroughly road test the car.</P>

 



<B><P>You'll need to turn<BR></B>

Check the steering before you start moving to make sure there are no popping, grinding, or clicking noises. Also, check for excessive play when you turn the wheel; the steering should be smooth and free of any vibration or jerks.</P>

 



<P>Check to make sure the car doesn't pull to one side on a straight traffic-free road. Remember how the tires looked? Uneven wear and pulling may mean the car needs an alignment, or there could have been crash damage.</P>





<B><P>Shifting<BR></B>

If the car is a stick or an automatic the shifts should be fluid and not jerky or rough. Remember what the transmission fluid level was at when you checked? If it was full and the engine begins to rev before the next gear engages, it may mean the clutch is going out in a stick, or perhaps a more severe problem in an automatic.</P>

 



<B><P>Engine<BR></B>

Make sure there is enough power when passing a car or going up a hill. If the car hesitates when you press on the gas there may be clogged fuel lines or clogged fuel injectors. Also, listen for any pinging or knocking sounds. A ping or knock may indicate the need for better gas or a tune-up.</P>

 



<B><P>Sometimes you just gotta stop<BR></B>

Again, make sure you're on a traffic-free road and try several stops from 55 mph and down. Consumer Reports and other sources say you need to feel, or listen, for any vibration in the pedal (anti-lock brakes not included), squealing, pulling to one side, or if it takes a very long time to stop the car. When you come to a stop press down on the brake pedal and if it sinks to the floor the car may have a leak.</P>





<B><P>What's that sound?<BR></B>

Listen for any unusual sounds such as thumping, rattles, ticking, or vibrations. These may be insignificant problems, but if they're annoying enough to turn the radio up to drown them out you have a problem.        <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR><P>Meanwhile, across the nation, Greg Greske has been running Lemon Aid for 15 years. His experience as a state auto inspection technician, mechanic, and used-car manager makes this inspection service invaluable to the used-car shopper.
</P>




<P>"My primary concern is to evaluate the vehicle as whole," said Greske. Explaining that he will determine what the fair market value is for the car so you know if that value is in line with the asking price.
</P>




<P>For $100 Lemon Aid provides the customer with a written report that details what, if anything, is wrong with the car. Then the problems are listed out and repair costs are estimated. </P>





<P>But neither of these two services are searching to fill their repair bays because they have none. Their sole purpose is to help you determine that this is the car you want to buy.</P>





<P>"We're not interested in making any of the repairs," says Rizzo. </P>





<P>Both services offer invaluable information about a used car. And if you plan on purchasing a used car find the used car inspection service in your town. It is your right to have that car inspected.  </P>





<P>"Not many people know this, but Federal law entitles you to at least one inspection," said Rizzo.</P>





<P>And an inspection may be the difference between a carefree drive home, or riding shotgun in a tow truck wondering what the hell went wrong.         <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG ALT="If"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="if2.jpeg"> you already posses poor credit stay away from companies that may promise to change all of those "credit mistakes". The most common practice for these agencies is to send in many, many, many requests at once to credit reporting agencies. This vain attempt is to try and overwhelm the credit reporting agency hoping they'll just through their hands up in the air and change everything. </P>

<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
<HR SIZE=3 ALIGN=Center SHADE>



<P><B>I don't need anybody to tell me how to spend my money.</B></P>





<P>Your options aren't limited to going to an agency. Taking matters into your own hands could be finding a bank or credit union to give you a consolidation loan. With a consolidation loan you are borrowing money to pay off borrowed money, and shifting credit around doesn't eliminate the problem. Also getting a consolidation loan requires more than a promise that you'll pay it back. </P>





<P>"You usually need to put something up as collateral," said Linda Schultz, a loan representative for Bank One. </P>





<P>Banks want some security on the money they're handing over. No big deal, right? Just small things like a house, car, boat, or anything else that the value is equal to the amount of the loan. And in return for collateralizing your loan you'll get an interest rate that could stretch beyond 20%. If that doesn't seem like too much be prepared to show two years of residence in that state and two years of employment. </P>





<P>The advent of low-interest credit cards presents the best option if you're considering consolidating debt. Companies such as <A HREF="http://www.citicorp.com">Citibank </A>(800-950-5114), 
<A HREF="http://www.chasecard.com">Chase Manhattan</A> (800-282-4273), and Discover (800-347-2683) offer balance transfers. 
</P>




<P>"A balance transfer allows the cardholder to transfer balances from other credit cards to a Citibank card," said Ed Dixon from Citibank public affairs. </P>





<P>According to Dixon, Citibank offers different balance transfer programs at various times during the year to pre-selected Citibank cardholders. These "programs", as Dixon explained, vary in interest rates, but it will be no higher than the interest rate you currently have on your card.
</P>




<P>"The balance transfer does give a lower interest rate than taking a cash advance," said Dixon.</P>





<P>The other major credit card companies also offer balance transfer programs. If you already have a credit card, or are applying for a new one, ask for a balance transfer. You will either be sent checks that you can write to your existing creditors, or banks such as Chase Manhattan can electronically transfer the funds for you.</P>





<P>The darkening hole of debt from charging your way through school can end if you want it to. </P>





<P>"The debt wont go away." said Rhode. "It's not like a fine wine, the situation doesn't get better with age."        <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>he pile of discarded resumes has grown deep at companies over the last few years. One way to keep from landing in "the pile" is to immediately identify what you're looking for in an objective statement. </P>



<P>"You've got one chance to grab someone's attention and the objective statement has to be the most powerful statement on the resume," says Bird. "It should be crisp and clear." </P>





<P>According to Bird, someone coming straight out school should make the connection between the skills and learning acquired in school to the position they're applying for. The statement should be no longer than one sentence.</P>





<P>"Starting with the objective statement your resume should flow correctly and read like a book," says Bird. This makes it even more important to tighten up your facts and limit your "book" to only one page.</P>





<P>Organization throughout your resume is the key to explaining what you can provide to a company. The biggest negatives in a resume are always incorrect spelling, poor organization and sloppiness. "Presentation, presentation, presentation," insists Bird.</P>





<P>After the objective statement, list your employment experience. You may not have several years on the job, but positions you held in school, part-time jobs, activities you've organized and other outside-of-the-classroom experiences are extremely relevant.
</P>




<P>"I like to see an interest in the field or industry," says Richard Burke, a manager of applications development with over fours years of interviewing and hiring. The majority of Burke's experience is with computer science majors in school or recent graduates.</P>





<P>According to Burke showing outside interests proves you're really interested in your field and you're not just in school to get an education.</P>





<P>After listing your experience clearly show what responsibilities and duties you've performed. This list should be relevant to the type of position you're applying for--and make sure to use action words to describe what you've done.</P>





<P>"Some of the better ones (list of responsibilities) show a result expected from a project someone worked on," says Burke. "One or two lines, that's all it takes." </P>





<P>And if you're going to list software or equipment that you're familiar with, make sure you have a clear understanding of what is listed.</P>





<P>"Anyone can pick up PC Week and write down every buzz word that's in there," says Burke. "But after having a conversation with someone for five minutes, I can tell if they know what they're talking about."</P>





<P>Education is usually near the bottom of a resume. All that is needed is your degree, specific major and university. If you want to list a GPA, make sure it's a 3.0 or above.</P>





<P>"I'm not really interested in a GPA, especially for someone with a couple years of experience," says Burke.</P>





<P>After you send your resume in, finding out whether someone has received it is always concern. Give the company some time before you call, and be prepared to leave a message.</P>





<P>"I have to dig through resumes to find a specific one and that takes time," says Veatch.</P>





<P>Competition for entry-level jobs today is fierce. And behind that veil of secrecy is someone who will judge whether you're right for the position you're applying for, making it imperative that you build the best resume.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>"T</FONT>he thing I hear the most is safety," Sharp says. "Security is a big issue." When it comes to security, she'll never tell a renter not to move into any particular neighborhood.</P>





<P>"That's something I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole," she says. "Legally, we can't. We can't discriminate at all. Besides, what's acceptable to some people isn't acceptable to someone else. They can call the sheriff's department and say, 'I'm thinking about moving into apartment B, what kind of activity have you had there the last six months?' At least they'll find out if there's been a hundred drug raids in a month."</P>





<P>Sharp says she always advises renters "to drive through a complex. You can tell (if it's safe) by the vibes."</P>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="rentlast.jpeg">




<P>At Apartment Locators, a would-be renter tells Sharp what they're looking for in an apartment and she punches the info into her PC. The list includes everything from renter's salary and pets to desired amenities and location. The computer breezes through its files to find the local unit that comes closest to the renter's ideal pad and then displays a series of color photos of that unit on another screen. Sharp often calls the complex to see if units are available and then gives each renter a printout of the apartment's information before they leave. </P>





<P>Assuming the renter is satisfied the complex is secure, the next issue is usually price. While the apartment needs to be a pleasant environment "(Some apartment managers say) you need to make at least three times the amount of rent to qualify for the apartment They're getting stricter with credit checks. It's not impossible to get an apartment with bad credit, but it may not be the apartment you want," Sharp says.</P>





<P>Like most locators, Apartment Showplace offers their service free to renters. The complex "pays us only if we send someone to the complex and they rent the apartment."</P>





<P>Sharp says one way to trim rent is to look for apartments offering "specials." "It's not unusual for a complex to offer one or more rent-free months. But if (renters) don't ask for them, they don't always offer them."</P>





<P>Another way to save a few bucks is in the amenities department; if you don't think you'll need the racquetball courts, clubhouses, fireplace, bay windows, whirlpools and weight rooms, look for apartments that don't offer those frills. If, on the other hand, having a washer and dryer provided in your apartment will save you a lot of quarters over the course of a year, find a place with that feature.</P>





<P>Recent grads may not have acquired the sofas, coffee tables and other trappings of civilized post-college life. "Some apartments offer furniture," Sharp says, "but sometimes it's cheaper to get it on your own."</P>





<P>Renters with pets can expect to pay more every month--assuming pets are allowed at all. "Everybody goes by pet limit or by pounds," Sharp says. Some places won't allow specific breeds like pit bulls, for example, she added. There are even a few places that want to see the pet or current vet papers for proof of shots.</P>





<P>To avoid some future maintenance hassles, Sharp always advises renters to "walk through" the apartment with the prospective landlord or manager. "Take a notebook along, too. Make notes of things and make sure everything meets your satisfaction."</P>





<P>Finally, read the lease carefully before you sign. If you have any questions about the apartment or the conditions of the lease, don't hesitate to ask.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG ALT=""I"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="i.jpeg"> used this guide to determine what range the entry-level position I interviewed candidates for was worth," said Dick Beatty, the owner-president of an out placement consulting group for major corporations. Beatty has written 16 books on job hunting, four of them bestsellers. </P>





<P>Finding out what the low, middle, and high offers are in the salary guide can prove to be great ammunition when an offer is made to you, according to Beatty. </P>





<P>Having that salary information and relating it to a potential employer can prove to be tricky. Have you ever been hung up on the "Salary Desired" question on a job application? Write down Open or Negotiable according to Veatch. </P>





<P>"That's not going to eliminate me from talking to somebody. Whereas if somebody puts down $30,000 and my position only pays $25,000 I am going to find someone that is a little closer."</P>





<P>And Veatch's point of view is not unusual.</P>





<P>"Just write down the word Open," said Beatty. "Don't give an employer a reason to pay you less than what they're able to offer or knock yourself out of the running by writing something down too high."</P>

<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
<HR SIZE=4 SHADE>

<P>Don't be fooled. Just because you've managed to dodge a salary figure up front, that doesn't mean you won't be asked again--and be expected to answer. </P>





<P>"When we ask for salary information in an interview you have to tell me what you want to make," said Debra Jones, a human resources manager, with more than 11 years of experience. "We gotta get something on the table."</P>





<P>Approach the subject by detailing why you feel you're worth the money you're about to ask for. Did you have an internship? Was your GPA above average? Did you work during school? These are just some of the questions you need to ask yourself before you're in the interview. Use your answers along with the data in the NACE guide to see if you may fit into a low, medium, or high pay range.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><IMG  SRC="leasetoon.jpeg" ALIGN=RIGHT>After you've determined a price, you now have what the industry calls the "capitalized cost." And if you're trading in a car, or putting money down, you're making a "capitalized cost reduction." </P>





<P>The reason why dealers can advertise such low payments on expensive cars is because unlike purchasing the vehicle and making monthly payments based on the total cost, you are only paying for the difference between what the car's price is and what the car is worth at the end of the lease. The term for what the car is worth at the end of the lease is called the "residual value." There will also be an interest charge on the total price of the car.</P>






<P>So, let's take a look at an example from Bragg. You are leasing a car with a selling price (capitalized cost) of $20,000 for 36 months and the car will be worth $10,000 at the end of the lease (residual value). The interest charge is 7.5 percent.</P>





<P>First, determine the difference between the capitalized cost ($20,000) and the residual value ($10,000), and you get $10,000. By dividing that difference ($10,000) by the length of the lease (36 months) you get $277.78. </P>





<P>Next, to figure out your monthly interest charge you must multiply the interest rate (7.5) by 24, which gives you .003125, making your monthly interest charge $93.75. If you add the interest charge of $93.75 to the $277.78 you have a monthly lease payment of $371.53.</P>

 



<P>This example clearly illustrates the need for you to take your time and bring a calculator when you go to negotiate a deal, and never let a salesman buffalo or browbeat you into something you don't want. Don't be afraid to walk away if you smell a bad deal.</P>





<P>Qualifying for a lease is another matter. "Credit requirements are the same for anyone," says Christy Heckel, credit manager for Banc One.</P>

  



<P>Those requirements are a spotless credit history with nothing derogatory on your record. You need to show two years of employment and have lived two years at the same residence. Your monthly debt can not exceed 40 percent of your available monthly income. And some lenders may require that you make as much as three times the amount of the vehicle.</P>





<P>But Heckle also adds that "...every customer is different." Making the credit requirements seem somewhat contradictory to what happens when you actually apply for a lease. "We handle every application on an individual basis."</P>





<P>If you've just graduated from college, you may not have the requisite two years on the job or at the same apartment to qualify for a lease. Ask the dealer, bank or financing company about college programs. They don't advertise or promote college deals very often, but they do exist.</P>





<P>A lease is more difficult to handle than a straight-out purchase of a car. So if you've decided to explore leasing as an option, be prepared to dig through all of the fine print. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>That's right! ENTER MAGAZINE wants to give you a <B>free</B> oil change if you give us the low down on your high-mileage car!</P>





<P>This is how it works:<BR>




1. The car has to have over 100,000 miles on it and still run.<BR>

2. Write 200 words or less about the car and what it, and you, have been through.<BR>

3. Take at least three pictures; these should include the outside of the car (front, side, or three-quarter angle from the front), and a picture of the odometer to verify the miles.<BR>

4. Send the essay and pictures to:</P>


<P ALIGN=CENTER>
ENTER MAGAZINE<BR>

46250-6431<BR></P>




<P>5. Entries must be received by the 20th of each month prior to the month of publication.</P>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="if.jpeg">you're a jerk about it they wont be too understanding," said Rhodes.</P>





<P>Before you make the call sit down and realistically evaluate your situation. How much do you make? How much do you spend on the essentials? What can you bare to do without? </P>





<P>Most importantly is to stop using credit, according to Kim Donahue, education coordinator at Consumer Credit Counseling (CCC) (800-282-6196). CCC is a nationwide non-profit organization that works with over 5000 creditors.</P>


<HR SIZE=3 ALIGN=Center SHADE>


<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="pullquote2.jpeg"></P>




<HR SIZE=3 ALIGN=Center SHADE>

<P>If you feel that debt has consumed you it may be time to turn to a credit counseling agency. These agencies will examine your balance sheet and evaluate how much you owe and how much you make. Taking into account the essentials, they will establish a payment you make to them each month. The payment is then distributed out to each creditor you owe until the balance of your debt is eradicated.</P>







<P>But don't expect results overnight. You have taken the first step in repairing your financial situation, but it may take some time.</P>





<P>"We try to get people debt free in four years," said Donahue. Four years may seem long, but a lifetime of marred credit reports can be devastating. </P>






<P>Although there are many credit counseling agencies out there that can prove to be of valuable assistance in times of credit duress, a non-profit agency could prove to be a smart financial decision. </P>





<P>"We ask for a voluntary donation of nine dollars per month," said Donahue. This is a meager fee compared to pay-by-the-minute 1-900 lines and package deals that for-profit services offer. Also be aware, some agencies make you surrender your paycheck. Do you want to feel like your ten years old again?</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<BODY BACKGROUND="back.gif" TEXT="#999999"> 











<BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="chance.jpeg">




<P>Every temp agency claims to be a convenience to companies and workers alike. Workers get a foot in the door, earn a paycheck and get an opportunity to prove themselves to people who can give them full-time jobs. Meanwhile, companies get to test drive workers before they make a commitment to hire. One agency customer service representative repeatedly used the phrase "temp to hire."</P>





<P>"It allows a company to try out a person," Doud says.</P>

<P>It's not unrealistic to go into a temp job hoping to go full time, according to Ford. "I was a temporary."
</P>





<P>Ford quotes statistics that suggest 38 percent of temp workers become permanent. "Companies look to temporary services to screen employees, and they will only keep the cream of the crop."</P>





<P>Manpower, like Kelly, began as a strictly clerical placement agency but has since added industrial and technical workers, Ford says. "I couldn't quote you bill rates (to companies)," she says, "but we're going to charge more for a person with greater skills."</P>





<P>Workers with greater skills can expect fatter paychecks. They won't get rich in the temp game, but someone with computer experience or software knowledge might find the money isn't awful. "Technical workers make good money," Ford says.</P>





<P>The explosion in the temporary field is a reflection of the current job market, according to some agencies. Herb Gilmore, business manager of the regional Alternative Work Services, a four-year-old general labor agency, says a person need look no further than the trend in downsizing to see why temporaries have become so valuable to companies.</P>





<P>Temporary agencies aren't "the only way to go," says Gilmore, "(but) it's a shrinking job market. Everything's gotten smaller. Companies will use temporaries to fill their up times."</P>





<P>One bit of advice remains true whether the person is seeking temp work or full-time employment. "Feel the market out and do some networking," Ford says.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>L</FONT>eonna Williamson has fast hands. The 47-year-old nurse and mother of two started boxing at Riverside last year after 10 years as a black-belt karate instructor. She thought she'd experiment with boxing to drop a few pounds. Williamson now weighs 158, down from 176.</P>





<P>At 5'3" and 106 pounds, Jackie Weisenborn doesn't need to lose any weight. She loves the challenge and the solitary nature of the sport. "I've always appreciated boxing. I'm not much of team person. Boxing is individualized. It's you and one other person," she says. "I like finding that place inside yourself."</P>



<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="boxing2.jpeg">


<P>While Weisenborn practiced her straight jabs, a lean male figure skipped rope. They moved around each other gracefully, giving way, sometimes sharing space. "There's a camaraderie," she says. "I think there's a respect."</P>





<P>Weisenborn would like to go pro. "Yeah, that would be cool. I'd like to go as far as I can go."</P>





<P>Brasher will go pro--assuming they can find anyone to step in the ring with the 5'10", 200-pound licensed barber with a strong right hand. "I'm left working out with the guys," she says.</P>





<P>"I'm not bothering with amateur. Pro's the way to go," she says confidently. Although she's only been training a month, Brasher is certain she has the makings of a good fighter. Chambers, who says she "picked things up quick," agrees.</P>





<P>"I bring it straight to the person. Women's fighting is more interesting because they're constantly punching where men are ducking and weaving. They're scared to get hit," Brasher says.</P>





<P>All the women say their boxing is a personal mission and not part of some feminist message. "It's not a statement," Leonard says. "It's totally from inside me. It has nothing to do with anything else."</P>





<P>Weisenborn is even more emphatic. "I'm going to do what I want to do," she says. "Why can't you fight and defend yourself and still go out at night in a dress and heels?"</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BODY BACKGROUND="back.gif" TEXT="BBBBAA"> 
<BR>
<BR>



<BLOCKQUOTE><P>After you provide your materials and you begin to answer questions there are several guidelines to keep in mind. According to Lashley, always avoid bad mouthing previous employers, avoid negative comments and also try not to give clich&eacute;  answers. "Interviewers hear those (clich&eacute; answers) 100 times a day," says Lashley. "Be original."</P>





<P>Veatch adds that when you answer the infamous question, "Tell me a little bit about yourself," you should be able to give your response quickly and clearly.  "I don't want to hear personal information like where you went to high school and what you like to do," says Veatch. "I expect to hear about your employment experience or outside activities in school." Try to keep your answer focused to the position and what experience you have that you can bring to the company.</P>

<IMG WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=260 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="newdon2.gif">
 


<P>There are many questions that are illegal for an employer to ask you. While you may be willing to answer some of these, be aware that you are not required to. </P>





<P>"For example I can't ask questions about marital status or health," says Lashley. "I also can't ask someone if the are able to work on Sundays." This question relates directly to religion, another area off limits for an interviewer.</P>





<P>But sometimes an employer will attempt to find out this information by creating a work around question and phrase it very carefully. If you are asked an illegal question you can ask the employer if that is something that relates to the job itself. This will also give you some insight into not only the interviewer, but the company. </P>





<P>Sometimes you may not only be interviewing with a single person, but sitting in a room and being asked questions by several people. This round-table type of interview can be difficult. "Just relax," says Lashley. "Try not to look fidgety or refuse to make eye contact"</P>





<P>Veatch agrees, "When someone asks you a question direct your response to them, but maintain eye contact with everyone else." The person who asked the question may get irritated if you do not respond to them but keep responding to the person with the most authority in the room.</P>





<P>After you have finished your interview always ask for the job. "The interviewer may not think you're interested in the position if you don't ask for it," says Lashley.</P>

 



<P>Don't just blurt out, "Can I have the job?" The best way to phrase the question according to Veatch is to relate that you are interested in the position and would like to know when the employer will be making a decision. Also, reinforce the unique skills, experiences and abilities that you can bring to the position and the company. </P>

 



<P>Following up after the interview is another key to distinguishing yourself from the other candidates. Within three to five days after your interview send a letter thanking the person you interviewed with.</P>

 



<P>"Right after the interview is finished drop a thank-you letter in the mail," says Veatch. Make sure you get the interviewer's business card so you can spell their name and position correctly.</P>





<P>Remember the interviewer's job is to determine what qualities someone can bring to a position that other candidates can not. Everything you say should offer the interviewer the evidence that you are the candidate that fits those unique qualities.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>he pile of discarded resumes has grown deep at companies over the last few years. One way to keep from landing in "the pile" is to immediately identify what you're looking for in an objective statement. </P>



<P>"You've got one chance to grab someone's attention and the objective statement has to be the most powerful statement on the resume," says Bird. "It should be crisp and clear." </P>





<P>According to Bird, someone coming straight out school should make the connection between the skills and learning acquired in school to the position they're applying for. The statement should be no longer than one sentence.</P>





<P>"Starting with the objective statement your resume should flow correctly and read like a book," says Bird. This makes it even more important to tighten up your facts and limit your "book" to only one page.</P>





<P>Organization throughout your resume is the key to explaining what you can provide to a company. The biggest negatives in a resume are always incorrect spelling, poor organization and sloppiness. "Presentation, presentation, presentation," insists Bird.</P>





<P>After the objective statement, list your employment experience. You may not have several years on the job, but positions you held in school, part-time jobs, activities you've organized and other outside-of-the-classroom experiences are extremely relevant.
</P>




<P>"I like to see an interest in the field or industry," says Richard Burke, a manager of applications development with over fours years of interviewing and hiring. The majority of Burke's experience is with computer science majors in school or recent graduates.</P>





<P>According to Burke showing outside interests proves you're really interested in your field and you're not just in school to get an education.</P>





<P>After listing your experience clearly show what responsibilities and duties you've performed. This list should be relevant to the type of position you're applying for--and make sure to use action words to describe what you've done.</P>





<P>"Some of the better ones (list of responsibilities) show a result expected from a project someone worked on," says Burke. "One or two lines, that's all it takes." </P>





<P>And if you're going to list software or equipment that you're familiar with, make sure you have a clear understanding of what is listed.</P>





<P>"Anyone can pick up PC Week and write down every buzz word that's in there," says Burke. "But after having a conversation with someone for five minutes, I can tell if they know what they're talking about."</P>





<P>Education is usually near the bottom of a resume. All that is needed is your degree, specific major and university. If you want to list a GPA, make sure it's a 3.0 or above.</P>





<P>"I'm not really interested in a GPA, especially for someone with a couple years of experience," says Burke.</P>





<P>After you send your resume in, finding out whether someone has received it is always concern. Give the company some time before you call, and be prepared to leave a message.</P>





<P>"I have to dig through resumes to find a specific one and that takes time," says Veatch.</P>





<P>Competition for entry-level jobs today is fierce. And behind that veil of secrecy is someone who will judge whether you're right for the position you're applying for, making it imperative that you build the best resume.</P>

<IMG ALT=""I"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="i.jpeg"> used this guide to determine what range the entry-level position I interviewed candidates for was worth," said Dick Beatty, the owner-president of an out placement consulting group for major corporations. Beatty has written 16 books on job hunting, four of them bestsellers. </P>





<P>Finding out what the low, middle, and high offers are in the salary guide can prove to be great ammunition when an offer is made to you, according to Beatty. </P>





<P>Having that salary information and relating it to a potential employer can prove to be tricky. Have you ever been hung up on the "Salary Desired" question on a job application? Write down Open or Negotiable according to Veatch. </P>





<P>"That's not going to eliminate me from talking to somebody. Whereas if somebody puts down $30,000 and my position only pays $25,000 I am going to find someone that is a little closer."</P>





<P>And Veatch's point of view is not unusual.</P>





<P>"Just write down the word Open," said Beatty. "Don't give an employer a reason to pay you less than what they're able to offer or knock yourself out of the running by writing something down too high."</P>
<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

<P ALIGN=CENTER><!-- Graphic Tag -->

<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
<HR SIZE=4 SHADE>

<P>Don't be fooled. Just because you've managed to dodge a salary figure up front, that doesn't mean you won't be asked again--and be expected to answer. </P>





<P>"When we ask for salary information in an interview you have to tell me what you want to make," said Debra Jones, a human resources manager, with more than 11 years of experience. "We gotta get something on the table."</P>





<P>Approach the subject by detailing why you feel you're worth the money you're about to ask for. Did you have an internship? Was your GPA above average? Did you work during school? These are just some of the questions you need to ask yourself before you're in the interview. Use your answers along with the data in the NACE guide to see if you may fit into a low, medium, or high pay range.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><IMG WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=209 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="coverage2a.gif"><B>Underinsured Motorist Coverage</B></P>





<P>Similar to uninsured motorist coverage, it means "you can collect the difference between what you carry and what they carry," says Beehler.</P>






<P>Most states require drivers to carry insurance providing the above coverage; the minimum amounts vary from state to state. Some coverage is optional, however, and Beehler calls these items "fringe" coverage. Adding them to your policy means paying larger premiums, of course, but this kind of protection can save you money depending on the amount or kind of driving you do.</P>





<P><B>Emergency Road Service</B></P>





<P>If your car breaks down on the highway outside Mayberry, Goober will rush you to the garage, fix your problem and get you back on the road. The roadside coverage is similar to that provided by AAA, General Motors or other services, car manufacturers or major oil companies.</P>





<P>"I'll mention it to people," says Beehler. "They probably don't need it, but even some people with AAA pay the $4 or so a year for it anyway."</P>





<P><B>Rental Car Reimbursement</B></P>





<P>"If your car is going to be in the shop for any length of time, you better have rental car coverage," says Beehler. "If you don't, tough nookies."</P>





<P>The amount of rental car coverage "can vary all over the place. There's probably one out there that'll pay up to $30 a day regardless of the car (you rent)," says Beehler.</P>






<P>Once you have a basic insurance glossary, "it's just a matter of going in or making the calls and asking the questions," says Beehler. "Are you driving back and forth to work? Where do you live? Some rates can vary by counties or territories. If you have a claim do you call an 800 number?"</P>





<P>Young drivers might like to know they can save a lot of time shopping for auto insurance thanks to their parents. "With most insurance companies, a young driver under a parent's policy can have that policy signed over to them," says Beehler. "It's exactly the same policy. Check with the agent, but usually all they have to do is sign it over to the student. By switching the main insurer from the parent to the student, the bills come to the home in the name of the student. If they're staying in the same house, even the premiums wouldn't change."</P>





<P>Move out of the mom and dad's house, however, and the young driver loses possible discounts like multiple car discounts.</P>





<P>Discounts really come into play as young drivers mature. Beehler says the highest rates are typically for drivers of either sex between ages 16 and 21. Rates vary from company to company, policy to policy, but usually rates drop considerably for men and women between the ages of 21 and 25. "Women get their last break at 25. Single males get another break at 30," says Beehler. "Marrieds at any age pay less."</P>





<P>Want some idea of how complicated a typical policy can be to understand? Let's say your car is stolen. The car is covered, of course, but what about your cherished CDs? The jeans and sweaters in the front seat are covered. So is the basketball in the back seat. And the typical policy will replace--no questions asked--the lawnchair and fishing pole in the trunk.</P>





<P>"A box of CDs get stolen? Not covered. They're gone," says Beehler.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B><P>What color should they all be?<BR></B>

Oil--Light brown and should drip off the dipstick. Shouldn't look thick or black.<BR>

Transmission--Pink and shouldn't smell burnt.<BR>

Radiator--Green and not rusty. And look for green stains on the radiator that could mean leaks.<BR>

Power steering and Brake fluids--it's not the color that's important, make sure they're full.</P>

<IMG  SRC="lookpic2.jpeg" ALIGN=RIGHT>



<B><P>Exhaust<BR></B>

Be careful not to burn yourself when you look for things as rust or damage. Also make sure the exhaust leaving the car is not blue or white. Blue smoke indicates the engine is burning oil and white means it is burning water. Either of these could mean costly repairs.</P>



<B>
<P>What a body<BR></B>

Check out the entire body of the car for dents, dings, mismatched paint, or rust. Areas that are prone to rust are wheel wells, trunk, and under the doors. Stand at each corner of the car and look along the side for any ripples or body panels that don't match. You're looking for signs the car has been in an accident and repaired to look like new.</P>





<B><P>Tires<BR></B>

Make sure there's a spare. Check for uneven tire wear, a signal that the car has been either wrecked or needs an alignment. If the tires are new or bald on a car with 25,000 miles or less it could mean the odometer has been turned back.</P>





<B><P>Suspension<BR></B>

Go to each corner of the car, push down and watch for only one or two bounces; any more and the car may need new shocks or struts. Also, if the car is front-wheel drive check the struts. Struts are behind the front tires and support the wheel. Look for any signs of leaks. Lastly, push and pull on the top of each front tire. If there is any movement it may mean bad bearings or suspension joints.</P>





<B><P>Let's go driving<BR></B>

If you're satisfied with all of your inspections, thoroughly road test the car.</P>

 



<B><P>You'll need to turn<BR></B>

Check the steering before you start moving to make sure there are no popping, grinding, or clicking noises. Also, check for excessive play when you turn the wheel; the steering should be smooth and free of any vibration or jerks.</P>

 



<P>Check to make sure the car doesn't pull to one side on a straight traffic-free road. Remember how the tires looked? Uneven wear and pulling may mean the car needs an alignment, or there could have been crash damage.</P>





<B><P>Shifting<BR></B>

If the car is a stick or an automatic the shifts should be fluid and not jerky or rough. Remember what the transmission fluid level was at when you checked? If it was full and the engine begins to rev before the next gear engages, it may mean the clutch is going out in a stick, or perhaps a more severe problem in an automatic.</P>

 



<B><P>Engine<BR></B>

Make sure there is enough power when passing a car or going up a hill. If the car hesitates when you press on the gas there may be clogged fuel lines or clogged fuel injectors. Also, listen for any pinging or knocking sounds. A ping or knock may indicate the need for better gas or a tune-up.</P>

 



<B><P>Sometimes you just gotta stop<BR></B>

Again, make sure you're on a traffic-free road and try several stops from 55 mph and down. Consumer Reports and other sources say you need to feel, or listen, for any vibration in the pedal (anti-lock brakes not included), squealing, pulling to one side, or if it takes a very long time to stop the car. When you come to a stop press down on the brake pedal and if it sinks to the floor the car may have a leak.</P>





<B><P>What's that sound?<BR></B>

Listen for any unusual sounds such as thumping, rattles, ticking, or vibrations. These may be insignificant problems, but if they're annoying enough to turn the radio up to drown them out you have a problem.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Miller recommends doing a "cost-benefit assessment" before going up the chain of command with a complaint. Disgruntled employees need to ask themselves "if this is one of those things I need to talk about or is it just a less than optimal situation, something I can live with," says Miller. "If you're being asked to do something illegal or not within your job responsibilities, then you probably need to consider going forward or risk getting in trouble. But if it's just something that rubs you the wrong way, you have to ask yourself, 'What are the ramifications going to be?'"</P>





<P>One of the ramifications could be revenge by a burned supervisor. "That's always a possibility," he says. "There's no easy answer."</P>





<P>Miller suggests talking to colleagues in the office. "If there are several people in the office and they all feel the same way, you'd probably be better off than if you were the lone voice in the woods. Then they (management) might be less likely to believe it's just you and that person."</P>





<P>At some point--either during the cost-benefit assessment or when all else has failed--the employee needs to consider certain career issues. On a personal level, young employees exposed to the ugliness of office politics and backstabbing can develop poor work habits or become disenchanted with a career field.</P>





<P>"Transfer is an option," says Miller. "You might want to ask yourself if you're better off staying or leaving (the company)."</P>





<P>Turmoil in the workplace is expensive. In its mildest form, a hostile office atmosphere is responsible for increased absenteeism and a decline in morale among otherwise good employees. Left unchecked, an angry office can lead to increased health-care claims, rapid employee turnover and even violence.</P>





<P>Miller says nearly one in four employees have been harassed, threatened or attacked on the job in one recent year and, in 1994, there were more than 1,000 workplace homicides. "It's pretty complex. Often it's spill-over violence that has nothing to do with the office itself," he says.</P>





<P>"Counselling or employee assistance programs need to be in place before these situations get explosive," says Miller. "There needs to be an environment in the office where these situations aren't tolerated."</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>"The national average right now is between 60 and 70 hours," says flight instructor Ed Hautala. This depends on how often you take lessons because, like riding a bike, you never forget, you just get a little rusty. Unlike riding a bike, being rusty when you're stalling a single-engine plane at 3,000 feet isn't good.</P>





<P>As you knock the kinks out of your ability to handle a plane in the air, you'll be expected to do certain maneuvers. You'll find sitting at the end of a runway and giving your plane full power and lumbering into the sky is easy, but, as Newton observed, everything eventually comes down. Of course some things are more difficult to bring down than others.</P>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="plane2.jpeg">



<P>"You'll need to land correctly before you can solo," says Hautala. And phrases like, "Pull up, pull up" become common when someone learns to land. </P>





<P>"Nobody can really teach you how to land," says May. "It's like a light switch that goes off in your head--'Oh, I got it!'" When the realization hits, and as words like yaw, pitch and roll leak into your vocabulary, you're close to taking the plane up by yourself. </P>





<P>Solo training involves the successful completion of several cross-country flights, planning your course carefully. You'll also need to handle all the in-flight emergency procedures to keep you out of trouble if a "situation" arises. </P>





<P>With each hour of flight time you'll begin to feel more comfortable and confident in the air. It's important to feel comfortable when you're flying, because if something goes wrong, you can't pull over and wait for help. That's why you'll need to begin training on a simple aircraft that can take the punishment of your constant mistakes.</P>





<P>"The Cessna has always been a great plane to get your license in," says Hautala. "It's very forgiving and easy to feel comfortable in." It's also relatively inexpensive. At around $50 and hour, the little Cessna helps keep the average cost for getting your private pilot's license between $3,500 to $4,000. This includes the instructor's time, test and aircraft rental.</P>





<P>After you've passed the flight instruction course, and your written exam, your final objective is to pass the check ride with an FAA examiner. This private pilot's test isn't like getting your driver's license.  A half-assed parallel park job won't do; everything must happen according to the rules.</P>





<P>"You'll be expected to be very proficient with the airplane," says Hautala. "The FAA examiner is there to go for a plane ride, but he's watching every move you make."</P>





<P>Learning to fly is not for everyone. But the flight simulator on your computer is nothing compared to the real thing.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><IMG WIDTH=41 HEIGHT=60 ALT="T"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tdrop.gif">he infomercials are especially enticing. One features a man who claims average folks can "live the life you've always dreamed of" by working "only a few hours a week." To bolster his credibility, the man is shown in grip-and-grin photos with George Bush, Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich and Jesse Helms. He introduces viewers to a number of "success" stories, including one 22-year-old man who claims to have "a net worth of $1.4 million" thanks to the program. For three payments of $59.95, you can have the program--a manual with audio and video tapes--from George Bush's friend.</P>





<P>Infomercials represent a "legitimate business in that if you pay the money, they'll send you a kit. The problem is 90 percent of the people attracted to these (offers) won't have the wherewithal or the business acumen to pull it off," says Nehf.</P>





<P>More personalized sales pitches can cut through your natural resistance like a surgeon. Imagine a friend or acquaintance inviting you to a party where you don't know any of the other guests. After an hour of forced conversation with strangers, the host tells everyone about terrific "marketing" opportunities you'd be a fool to pass up. All you have to do is line up six people who agree to sell toothpaste or hair tonic and give you a huge cut of their profits. Those six people then recruit their own people, and you get money from them, too. You'll have to give a slice of your profits to your host-recruiter, of course, and he'll have to give some of his money to his recruiter, and so it goes all the way up "the pyramid."</P>

<CENTER><HR WIDTH=275 SIZE=2 SHADE></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>



<P>Pyramids are so tempting and the psychology is so powerful, even the most skeptical individuals can wilt under pyramid pressure.</P>





<P>"They're legal as long as the money is being generated by the sales of goods and services," says Nehf. "The problem with pyramid schemes is there aren't enough people to support it. The people at the top get rich but the people at the middle or bottom don't."</P>





<P>Nehf says "some people do  make a lot of money, but they work hard at it. They're the same people who'd make a lot of money doing anything because they'll work hard and spend the time necessary (to make a profit)." But "unfortunately, the most gullible people in society aren't well protected," says Nehf, so "make sure you deal with legitimate businesses whenever you can."</P>





<P>Nehf's advice: "If it sounds like you can make a lot of money without working hard, you can't."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><IMG WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=54 ALT="O" ALIGN=LEFT SRC="odrop.gif">ne of the most common road-side emergencies are flat tires. When your tire blows, or is losing air, get over to the side of the road as quickly as possible. If you were hoping you could just jam a can of Fix-a-Flat into your tire and keep rolling, think again. "Those type of sealants only work if you've got compressed air with you," says Smith. If you're losing air you can seal the leak with these products, but you can't fill the tire up with air.</P>





<P>The first rule to repairing a flat is to take of couple of minutes and read the manual about where to put the jack, suggests Smith. If you put the jack in the wrong place it makes the car unbalanced. Also, be sure not to jack up the car on uneven ground.  "A big semi can blow by and an unbalanced car will fall--or fall on you," says Smith.</P>





<P>If your car doesn't have a full-size spare, but has a "doughnut," remember to read the side of the tire about how far and fast you can go. Most doughnuts will only last for 35 miles with a maximum speed limit of 50 mph.</P>

<P>Blown tires aren't the only thing that can happen when you're driving. When the temperature stretches towards--and even past--the 100 degree barrier, overheating is a common problem. "Turn your heat on, all the way to hot," says Smith. As uncomfortable as that sounds, Smith says the heater triggers another cooling system that will get you to the next exit.</P>





<P>Smith also recommends bringing a roll of duct tape so you can temporarily seal a leaking hose. "It's very temporary, but it'll get you to where you can get help."</P>





<P>Also, bring along an extra fan belt. You may not have the skills to replace a fan belt yourself, but it'll save you from trying to find the part in the middle of nowhere. "If you break down on Sunday most (auto) part places are closed, but if you have the belt you can have a gas station replace it and get back on the road," says Smith.</P>





<P>All of these types of repairs need to be approached with your safety in mind. Always stand on the passenger side of the car, because if your car is hit, you'll be able to avoid becoming something for the Department of Transportation to clean up. "We like to think that doesn't happen, but it does," says Smith.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

Turner, 21, recently received her English teaching degree and English as second language certification. Ali, 27, has a masters in liberal arts with an undergrad degree in English. His teaching experience consisted of substitute teaching and non-classroom public awareness campaigning. They both had done public-service work and been exposed to various cultures and nationalities through extracurricular activities.</P>





<P>After the interview, if all goes well, you will be nominated for a position. At this point you find out what type of work you will be doing and in what area of the world. Your file goes to Washington where you will be evaluated and then sent on to placement--i.e., the government beauracracy really begins.  You will be asked to submit medical information to attain medical clearance.  Both Turner and Ali say this was the most difficult part of the process.</P>





<P>"They would lose (medical forms)," says Turner. <IMG WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=211 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="peace2.gif">Ali agrees and says he had to have four wisdom teeth removed to gain medical clearance. Both complained of the medical costs incurred. Garamindi admits it is frustrating to wait for medical clearance, but it is necessary to assure the volunteers health and safety while living in questionable living situations.</P>





<P>Once your name has reached the placement office--probably months from the time you sent in your application--the placement office will start looking for a country's training group for you to join. It took approximately a year for Turner and Ali from the time they applied to the day they left.</P>





<P>Your qualifications are matched with a job and country. You have to hope the country is still open to the Peace Corps; it can change at any time due to a lack of invitation by the host country or any situation that might make the country unsafe for volunteers. And they have to get it timed so that you can leave at the appointed time. Seventy-three percent of trainees depart for service during spring and summer so volunteers ready to leave during that time will be easier to place. Recruiters suggest applying about six to nine months before you would like to go but no later than September if you want to leave the following spring.</P>





<P>While you are given the opportunity to specify where you want to go and what type of job, Wiedel says flexibility is important. While the Peace Corps tries to give applicants a choice, it is often difficult to coordinate. Ali specified Africa and was given an invitation to go to Kasakstan, formerly part of the Soviet Union. Turner had asked for an East European country and was looking forward to going to Bulgaria but could not due to medical hold-ups. She accepted her second invitation to go to Kazakstan, which is actually closer to China than Europe. Yet both seemed excited to be going to Kazakstan, and Ali says he likes the randomness of going wherever the Peace Corps sends you. </P>





<P>The last step is receiving the long-awaited invitation that will start a flurry of activity as you race to get ready for departure. Fingers crossed, the process will not wear you out too bad and you'll feel like Turner.</P>





<P>"I don't think there is anything better I could do with my life right now,"  says Turner.</P>





<P>Some suggestions in applying:  Be persistent--keep calling. Make copies of everything. And realize that it can be a long process so you need to be willing to live with not knowing where and when you'll be going.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><IMG SRC="tdrop.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="T">he perfect cover letter will draw attention to your resume and let your personality show through. Keep the letter short, however. "Don't try to do the whole interview in the cover letter," says Veatch, who looks for a few quick main points in a cover letter that let her know "why I should read further."</P>





<P>Goodwin says applicants should keep cover letters to three or four paragraphs. "It should be brief and to the point," he says. "The candidate needs to begin with why he or she is applying," says Goodwin, "then talk about what it is in his or her background that makes them a strong contender for that position."</P>





<P>Human resource people disagree on how assertive an applicant should be. "Unless an ad stipulates not to call (the business directly), I suggest closing with a line or two that says the candidate will call the week of such-and-such for other info or to schedule an interview," says Goodwin. But one personnel director claimed that wasn't necessary, saying curtly, "I'll call you if I'm interested."</P>

<BR>


<P>Be confident without being cocky. "'Look no further, I'm the person you want.' Well, that's a pretty strong assumption to make when you're not exactly sure what I want," says Veatch.</P>





<P>Companies are looking for people with qualifications that most closely match open positions, says Veatch. Make a point to draw to attention to what the company wants. If an ad asks for experience in a particular field and you have it, point it out in your letter. You don't want HR people wondering who you are and what you can bring to the company. </P>





<P>It's OK to use "active" words to describe your work ethic or job experience, but laying it on too thick can have the reverse effect. HR and personnel people have seen and read it all and can spot a puff job a mile away. Also, if you use industry jargon or heavy computer lingo, remember that a little goes a long way.</P>


 


<P>The same holds true for the type of paper applicants choose for their cover letter. "I tell candidates that unless you're in a creative field--advertising or elementary education--be pretty conservative," says Goodwin. "Although they may want to be creative to get attention, they're taking a risk in doing that." He says sturdy white, off-white or ivory papers are the best choices. No bright colors or sissy pastels need apply.</P>





<P>Competition for jobs is fierce, especially entry-level jobs that only require zero-to-three years of experience. Mistakes--or a weak cover letter--are death to your job chances.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Katz says the odor is created when, " after the nutritional complexes are digested, the by-products of this chemical breakdown are left over. These chemicals are known as Volatile Sulfur Compounds (VSCs), and contain such compounds as Hydrogen Sulfide, which is the same chemical known as the 'rotten egg' smell."</P>


	


<P>Katz agrees that there are several factors influencing the amount of sulfur compound produced. A dry mouth, diet and medications, especially sulfa drugs, can have an effect. He also adds heredity, and hormonal changes as possible factors.</P>


	


<P>Diagnosing Halitosis can be done with a "Halimeter." This piece of equipment is designed to measure the amounts of VSCs in parts per billion. <IMG WIDTH=192 HEIGHT=160 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC=" breath1.gif">According to Dr. Smith, a Halimeter operates like a Breathalyzer, and is able to target the location of the highest levels of VSCs "from the front of the mouth, back of the mouth, from the digestive system, of the lungs, or from the sinuses." According to Dr. Katz, a researcher from Japan determined several years ago that VSC concentrations of about 70 parts per billion are detectable to the human nose. " We use this number as the borderline number of Clinical Bad Breath. Measurements of over 120 have shown us that there is a cumulative effect on the build-up of these sulfur compounds. We use 120 as the base of the very high level," Katz says.</P>


	


<P>"Our goal is to provide our patients with a confidence level by assisting the patient to get below the 70 level. Ideally, we have gotten most of our patients down to the 20's and 30's," Katz says.</P>


	


<P>If the halitosis is oral in origin, "treatment would consist of specialized products (a mouth rinse, toothpaste and a gel, a special toothbrush and a tongue cleaner, and an oral irrigator) which in combination provide a very effective and fast remedy to this condition," Smith says.</P>


	


<P>Tongue cleaners or "scrapers" come in a variety of styles, from a nylon ribbon design that slides across the surface of the tongue to razor blade-less razors that scrape at the tongues surface. Whichever design, their effectiveness is questionable. Dr. Katz says, "The tongue should be kept very clean. However, patients who have seen us have mentioned that in many cases, scraping the tongue is futile." Dr. Katz and his associates use tongue scrapers in treatment, but "a large majority of patients who have used these or other items have damaged their tongues, thinking that the harder you use it, the better the effect." Katz says, "[the bacteria] dont even live on the tongue surface, but deep within the tongues papillae (fibers)."</P>


	


<P>Commercial products like the " BreathAssure,"  which targets the cause of bad breath in the stomach and digestive tract are hot sellers. This is just another example of advertising hype to convince the public of the benefits of their "miracle" product, claim the doctors. BreathAssure, advertised on Radio and TV by actor George Kennedy (of Naked Gun side-kick fame), "is a gelatin capsule containing mainly parsley oil extract [that] is released into the bloodstream," Smith says." This all seems quite logical, but the location of VSCs is NOT in the blood, but they are found in highest concentration in the mouth, which is completely bypassed by swallowing the capsule!" Dr. Katz agrees. "It is based on mythology that bad breath originates in the stomach [when food is digested], and it doesn't."</P>



<P>"All treatment of Halitosis is based on using products containing stabilized chlorine dioxide. In contrast to plain chlorine dioxide which is used to treat water sewage (and the end product is harmful oxides), the interaction of stabilized chlorine dioxide with VSCs will eliminate the odor-causing compounds and the end result will be simple salts. An all natural product is used, with no harmful by-products produced." said Dr. Smith.</P>


	


<P>Dr. Katz says, "Chlorine dioxide has been used safely for over 100 years in water purification. It reduces odors by oxidizing sulfur bonds in various sulfur compounds in nature. Studies have shown that chlorine dioxide can even be digested safely." To treat patients, Dr. Katz explains, "You must use a pH balanced stabilized chlorine dioxide solution, without any sodium lauryl sulfate."</P>


	


<P>If you've decided you need professional help, you have a few options. Besides your local dentist, you may try a tongue scraper for yourself, to test its effectiveness (but be careful). They start at around $1, and go up.</P>


	


<P>Dr. Katz's California and New York Breath Centers have locations on both coasts, and usually require 3-4 visits, and costs $495, or, if youre out of that area, you can order their starter kit for $69, or receive information at 1-800-97-FRESH.</P>


	


<P><IMG WIDTH=91 HEIGHT=77 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="breath2.gif">Dr. Smith's Fresh Breath Centres are located in various cities, with new offices opening all the time. Call 416-787-6660 for information.</P>


	


<P>Some insurance plans may cover treatment. It sometimes is covered as long as you are seeing a dentist, and some plans may cover only part of the treatment. If you are in doubt, check with your provider.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Susan Pessoa, assistant administrator for food and beverage at Miami's Hotel Inter-Continental, says every few months they throw a night for cigar lovers. Hor d'oeuvres, champagne and cigars are enjoyed in the salon before everyone moves to another part of the restaurant for the six-or-seven course meal. "There's usually a theme with each dinner," Pessoa says. "In the past we've done the taste of Russia or the taste of Spain. The chef will come out and describe the meal and explain something about it and the country. Then it's eat, drink and be merry."</P>

<P>And smoke? "And smoke," Pessoa says.</P>

<P>The typical $100 dinner draws about 40-45 people, and as many as 10 or more diners will be women. "You'd be surprised. More and more woman are taking part," Pessoa says. "One time they took up one whole table. Five at one table."</P>

<P>Has she ever been asked to join the boys and fire up a Hoyo de Monterrey or H. Upmann? "It's interesting you would ask that. I've been invited on numerous occasions to sit in with them," <IMG WIDTH=260 HEIGHT=48 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="cigar2.gif">  says Pessoa, who admits to having taken "a few" puffs. While she does not find the aroma objectionable by any means, "to sit in a room full of cigar smoke, I can't."</P>

<P>Although some patrons will light up between courses, Pessoa frowns on the practice. "I can't understand smoking during a meal. Now, if it's after dinner with a nice cognac, like my father used to have, that's fine," she says.</P>

<P>Miami's Mayfair House Hotel also throws occasional nights for cigar buffs in their nightclub, Ensign Bitters, says Dan Mortesi, manager of the hotel's Mayfair Grill.</P>

<P>The Mayfair even has an in-house tobacco shop, the Havana Rays. Manager John Price loves to talk tobacco and asks several questions before suggesting a good cigar for beginners.</P>

<P>Price does not recommend going directly to classic Cuban Cohibas or Montecristos, naturally. "Anything in the Macanudo line," he says. "It's a mild line. It's so mild that if you have a drink, the taste is gone from your mouth. For the whole line, the taste is soft. You can smoke different sizes, but they'll all be mild."</P>

<P>What is it about a Macanudo? "It depends on the individual," Price says, "but it won't choke you out."</P>

<P>Smoke those for a couple of weeks, Price adds, and the novice cigar smoker will be ready to graduate to a more robust, full-bodied cigar. Price says smokers love to try different and heartier cigars the same way wine fanciers love sampling different vintages. And like wine experts, cigar buffs have a vocabulary all their own, often using words like cedar and cinnamon, nutty or leathery to describe top-of-the-line cigars. A panatela from the Dominican Republic may be said to have "a hint of pepper." A corona from Honduras might be "floral" or have a "coffee" flavor.</P>

<P>"You'll want to move up," Price promises. "Smoke these for a couple of weeks and I'll sell you a box."</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG ALT="W"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="w.jpeg">hether the microphone is on the stage or in the studio, Ralph is happy. "If someone said, 'Ralph, if you had 24 hours to do whatever you want, what would you do?' (I'd) DJ. That's my rest and relaxation. That's my place to be me," she says.</P>





<P>Ralph truly doesn't understand people who aren't into hard work, who don't want to fill their free time with another job, who don't want to go into the office on weekends to do filing. The young woman who found time to get her masters at Indiana University, DJ at a top-rated radio station, sing blue-collar rock on weekends and (believe it or not) squeeze in some work as an accountant, can't understand people who take the American Dream for granted.</P>





<P>"I was willing to work midnight to six a.m., Friday and Saturday nights, during my college years for $4.95 an hour," says Ralph. "Some people won't do that. It's bitch, bitch. 'That's hard work.'</P>





<P>"Awright," Ralph snaps, "go pick tomatoes from six in the morning until midnight and then come back and tell me if you don't mind working midnight to six in the air conditioning, playing rock music."</P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG ALT="E"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="e2.jpeg">     rin Haggerty, 22, a senior at Indiana University and a member of the IMU Outfitters on the Bloomington campus, agrees. "It's really great," she says. Because fear of falling is so natural, Haggerty says beginners are sometimes encouraged to take a tumble early and get the fear out of their system, freeing the climbers to concentrate on climbing.</P>

<IMG SRC="climb5.jpeg" ALIGN=RIGHT>



<P>"You have to fall once to feel comfortable when you're a first-time climber," says Haggerty.</P>



<P>Experienced climbers don't all have single-digit body fat, perfect cholesterol levels, and joints that work without creaking. It just seems that way. And along with odd-looking rubber shoes, real climbers often wear skin-tight Spandex, which only accentuates the near-anorexic appearance of many of these athletes.</P>





<P>Chris Bowman says it's a great sport to whip you in shape. Although he prefers mountaineering (a style that combines outdoor climbing with hiking), he enjoys/appreciates traditional climbing (where climbers insert devices in rock cracks and then run their ropes through the anchored devices as they climb) and sport climbing (similar to indoor in that the devices are already in place). Bowman likes mountaineering because "you've got a pack on and you've got a destination."</P>

<IMG ALT="After"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="after.jpeg"> determining what you feel you're worth for a position, make sure you know your bottom line. Detail what your expenses are now and the additional costs after accepting a position. These costs could include rent, food, loans, credit cards, clothes for the job, gas to get to work, and lunches out.</P>





<P>"The problem with the college graduate is that $1,000 or $2,000 can make a difference," said Jones. That $1,000 or $2,000 could mean an additional $60 to $120 a month. So try to include costs that may seem insignificant at first but could help get you by in the long run.</P>





<P>Most importantly, according to Beatty, is that you state a salary range as opposed to a figure. This will give you and the interviewer room with which to work.</P>





<P>"Every position has a salary range," said Veatch. Starting your range slightly above what your bottom line is and ending the range about 10 percent above that assures you're asking for an amount you'll need to survive. But if the employer's offer isn't as much as you believe you're worth, are you in a position to negotiate?</P>





<P>"I think there's always room for negotiation," said Veatch. "But I think you need to be realistic."</P>





<P>Being realistic means establishing your value first before you try to negotiate salary, according to Beatty. Furthermore, know the salary range for that position and don't go any higher than 10 percent of what the employer is offering.  
</P>




<P>"Also, being realistic means that sometimes negotiations fall through," said Veatch. </P>





<P>Get a feel for how willing the interviewer is to negotiate and try to weigh the overall picture before you begin to ask for more money. Don't lose sight of what is important to you in the job, and consider what other benefits are involved with the job offer.
</P>




<P>"An average of 30 percent of your salary goes towards benefits," said Jones. </P>





<P>And these benefits are not always apparent at first. Depending on what the employer values, "benefits" could include the work environment, equipment you use, or flexible hours. Take the entire offer into consideration before you ask for the next card in the interviewer's hand.</P>





<P>Interviews will probably always be like a game of cards, but knowing some of the rules to the game could help tip the deck in your favor.         <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/blkend.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A>

Honey Glazed Carrots, Seasoned Rice,
 and dessert  <I>(perhaps a <A HREF="des1.html">Baked Apple</A>)</I>
</P></H3></B>

<P>Have you ever wanted to be romantic on short notice, and all that's in the refrigerator is beer, salsa, and chicken salad?  It's difficult, when you live alone, to be frugal with your money, but at the same time be elegant.  I have devised a menu that provides romance with easy steps, a small amount of time, and little money.  Get ready for a menu that will enhance a romantic evening!</P>



<BR>







<B>

<P>8-10 oz. of beef sirloin tips (you will probably have to buy beef sirloin 	and have the butcher cut it into pieces for you)</P>




<P>Burgundy wine or other dry red wine</P>




<P>1 red pepper</P>




<P>1 green pepper</P>




<P>1 small onion (I suggest vidalia or a white onion)</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of butter</P>




<P>1 small package of baby carrots</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of honey
White rice (enough for two people)
1 beef boullion cube</P>






<P>Directions</P></B>




<P>1. Cut the peppers into thin strips and discard the seeds.  Then cut the onion into thin rings.  Place enough of each for two people into a skillet with the butter.  Saute' until the veggies are hot and partially cooked, but still a bit crisp (about five minutes).  Set aside.</P>




<P>2. Heat a skillet or wok on high heat and add the beef tips.  Cook briefly on all sides to brown (this seals in the juices).  Turn the heat to medium, then add 1/4 -1/2 cup of the burgundy wine and continue to cook until the beef is no longer pink in the center.</P>




<P>3. While the beef is cooking, follow the directions for the rice and get that started.  Add the boullion to the water according to the instructions.  This will flavor the rice quite nicely.  </P>






<P>4. Go back to the beef tips while the rice is doing its thing.  Add the sauteed veggies to the tips, season to taste with salt and pepper, and turn the heat to low.</P>





<P>5. Check the rice before you move to the carrots.</P>






<P>6. The fastest and easiest way to cook these carrots is going to be in the microwave.  Put the carrots, about a teaspoon of water, and a dash of salt into a microwave safe container.  Cover with plastic wrap, place in the microwave, and cook on high for about three minutes.  After this time, poke them with a fork to test them.  They are done whenever they are as tender as you like.  Drain off the water, and add the honey.  Place the plastic wrap back over the bowl and place back inside the microwave (do not turn it on...this just provides a place to keep the carrots warm).</P>




<P>7. Check the rice.  Check the beef tips.  If everything is hot and done, you are ready to plate it up and eat it.  **If the sauce with the beef tips seems too runny, take about 1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon of cornstarch, mix it with a bit of cold water (to form a paste), and stir it into the beef tip mix.  This will thicken the sauce.  Continue to cook just a few minutes longer, and then serve.</P>



<P>Bon Appetit!</P></B>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Baked Apples</H2>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P>This old favorite is a deceptively simple recipe. It makes a sweet, enticing desert, or a spicey treat any afternoon.</P>







<P>1.	Take your favorite apple, core it and peel the top half. 
</P>




<P>2.	Place in a oven-safe container just large enough to hold the apple.
</P>




<P>3.	Fill the center with 1 teaspoon of butter or margarine, 1 teaspoon<BR>
 brown sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon.
</P>




<P>4. 	Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Put apple in oven for 10 minutes.

<P>Bake for 10 more minutes.</P>







<P>5.	Repeat process until apple is tender when poked with a fork.</P>





<P>6.	Remove from oven carefully. Sprinkle more brown sugar if

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Chocolate Carmel Pecan Ice Cream Pie
</H2><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Here's a dessert that is perfect for company or just to enjoy all by yourself.  And guess what? It is sooooo easy!

<B>

<P>1 pre-made pie shell (graham or cookie)</P>





<P>1 quart vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt</P>





<P>1 small package chocolate chips</P>



<P>1  small package pecan pieces</P>





<P>1 jar carmel ice cream topping </P>

</B>

<B>Directions</B>



<P>1. Pull ice cream out of the freezer and allow to thaw on the counter for about 1/2 hour.</P>





<P>2. Open the pie shell, but leave it in the foil tin.</P>





<P>3. Melt 1/2 cup of chocolate chips over a hot-water bath or in the microwave.  </P>





<P>4. Spread the chocolate evenly over the bottom of the pie crust.  Put it in the refrigerator to harden the chocolate.
</P>




<P>5. Spread the ice cream into the pie shell (on top of the chocolate).  Use only enough to almost reach the top edge of the shell.</P>

 



<P>6. Pour the carmel over the ice cream and smooth.  You probably won't need all the topping.</P>





<P>7. Sprinkle the pecans on top.  You could also sprinkle chocolate chips on if you want.  Freeze for two hours.</P>





<P>To serve, use a warm, wet knife to slice through the pie.  Garnish with whipped cream and serve.</P>



<B>*</B>Hot chocolate or flavored coffee goes well with this.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Kitchen Basics--Knives</H2>
<BR>
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT>f you are just starting out on your own, chances are you don't have much.  Any little bit of information can be helpful. Unless you are a chef, you probably don't know where to begin when it comes to buying knives.  Knives are essential for cutting, slicing, dicing and chopping. Now, if you plan to live off hot dogs, lunch meat and beer, knives will probably never enter your kitchen--nor will a date--but if you plan to eat well and survive on your own, here are a few tips.</P>





<P>There are many different brands of knives. Some come already boxed ($20-$30) and these are fine. But if you want something a bit more durable--something to last through the years--you will have to spend a bit more money. I'm referring to the knives that are sold individually. Sometimes they are boxed, but most often not. There are usually about a million to choose from, but these are the ones you will need to survive.</P>





<P>The first is the chef knife. This knife generally comes in 10" and 8".  Which size you choose is completely up to you--whatever feels most comfortable. Both knives serve the same purpose. The chef knife is good for slicing vegetables, cutting large portions of raw meat, chopping and dicing. It's one of the most important knives.</P>





<P>The next is the utility. This knife does most things the chef knife does, but is slightly smaller--usually 6" to 8". It's good for pantry work, such as preparing lettuce, fruits and so on. It's also good for carving poultry.</P>





<P>The paring knife--usually about 2" to 3"--is probably the most widely used knife in the home kitchen. It is small, versatile and can be more easily manipulated and maneuvered than the other two. Used mostly for trimming and paring fruits and vegetables, it can also be used as a baking tool for trimming pie doughs and cutting pasta. People find this to be most useful for smaller jobs (cutting strawberries, slicing celery, paring apples).  Because it is so small, it fits comfortably in your hand.</P>

  



<P>Don't let the salespeople talk you into a 17 piece set so they can get their comission. Buy what you want and need. You have to live with what you purchase, not the salesperson.  Keep your mind set and dive right in.</P>





<P>Things to remember when buying knives:</P>




<UL>
<LI>How much can you afford?
<LI>How will you use the knives?
<LI>Spend a little extra for quality--it's better in the long run.
<LI>How long do you want these knives to last?
</UL>



<P>Some of the most popular brands are Chicago Cutlery, Henckles, and Wustoff, although there are many other brands.</P>





<P>Prices range from $10 per knife to over $400 for top of the line. Just remember--whatever feels right. Hold the knife in your hand. If it doesn't feel right, don't buy it. Be sharp and don't get cut. Have fun!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<IMG ALT="If"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="if2.jpeg"> you already posses poor credit stay away from companies that may promise to change all of those "credit mistakes". The most common practice for these agencies is to send in many, many, many requests at once to credit reporting agencies. This vain attempt is to try and overwhelm the credit reporting agency hoping they'll just through their hands up in the air and change everything. </P>



<HR SIZE=3 ALIGN=Center SHADE>



<P>
<IMG ALT="NEWS FLASH"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="news.jpeg">Companies that report your credit aren't stupid, and they wont change it. The only thing that can change poor credit is time. </P>


<HR SIZE=3 ALIGN=Center SHADE>



<P><B>I don't need anybody to tell me how to spend my money.</B></P>





<P>Your options aren't limited to going to an agency. Taking matters into your own hands could be finding a bank or credit union to give you a consolidation loan. With a consolidation loan you are borrowing money to pay off borrowed money, and shifting credit around doesn't eliminate the problem. Also getting a consolidation loan requires more than a promise that you'll pay it back. </P>





<P>"You usually need to put something up as collateral," said Linda Schultz, a loan representative for Bank One. </P>





<P>Banks want some security on the money they're handing over. No big deal, right? Just small things like a house, car, boat, or anything else that the value is equal to the amount of the loan. And in return for collateralizing your loan you'll get an interest rate that could stretch beyond 20%. If that doesn't seem like too much be prepared to show two years of residence in that state and two years of employment. </P>





<P>The advent of low-interest credit cards presents the best option if you're considering consolidating debt. Companies such as <A HREF="http://www.citicorp.com">Citibank </A>(800-950-5114), 
<A HREF="http://www.chasecard.com">Chase Manhattan</A> (800-282-4273), and Discover (800-347-2683) offer balance transfers. 
</P>




<P>"A balance transfer allows the cardholder to transfer balances from other credit cards to a Citibank card," said Ed Dixon from Citibank public affairs. </P>





<P>According to Dixon, Citibank offers different balance transfer programs at various times during the year to pre-selected Citibank cardholders. These "programs", as Dixon explained, vary in interest rates, but it will be no higher than the interest rate you currently have on your card.
</P>




<P>"The balance transfer does give a lower interest rate than taking a cash advance," said Dixon.</P>





<P>The other major credit card companies also offer balance transfer programs. If you already have a credit card, or are applying for a new one, ask for a balance transfer. You will either be sent checks that you can write to your existing creditors, or banks such as Chase Manhattan can electronically transfer the funds for you.</P>





<P>The darkening hole of debt from charging your way through school can end if you want it to. </P>

<IMG ALT="After"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="after.jpeg"> determining what you feel you're worth for a position, make sure you know your bottom line. Detail what your expenses are now and the additional costs after accepting a position. These costs could include rent, food, loans, credit cards, clothes for the job, gas to get to work, and lunches out.</P>





<P>"The problem with the college graduate is that $1,000 or $2,000 can make a difference," said Jones. That $1,000 or $2,000 could mean an additional $60 to $120 a month. So try to include costs that may seem insignificant at first but could help get you by in the long run.</P>





<P>Most importantly, according to Beatty, is that you state a salary range as opposed to a figure. This will give you and the interviewer room with which to work.</P>





<P>"Every position has a salary range," said Veatch. Starting your range slightly above what your bottom line is and ending the range about 10 percent above that assures you're asking for an amount you'll need to survive. But if the employer's offer isn't as much as you believe you're worth, are you in a position to negotiate?</P>





<P>"I think there's always room for negotiation," said Veatch. "But I think you need to be realistic."</P>





<P>Being realistic means establishing your value first before you try to negotiate salary, according to Beatty. Furthermore, know the salary range for that position and don't go any higher than 10 percent of what the employer is offering.  
</P>




<P>"Also, being realistic means that sometimes negotiations fall through," said Veatch. </P>





<P>Get a feel for how willing the interviewer is to negotiate and try to weigh the overall picture before you begin to ask for more money. Don't lose sight of what is important to you in the job, and consider what other benefits are involved with the job offer.
</P>




<P>"An average of 30 percent of your salary goes towards benefits," said Jones. </P>





<P>And these benefits are not always apparent at first. Depending on what the employer values, "benefits" could include the work environment, equipment you use, or flexible hours. Take the entire offer into consideration before you ask for the next card in the interviewer's hand.</P>





<P>Interviews will probably always be like a game of cards, but knowing some of the rules to the game could help tip the deck in your favor.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><P>Candlelight Dinner of Burgundy Beef Tips, <BR>
Honey Glazed Carrots, Seasoned Rice,
 and dessert  <I>(perhaps a <A HREF="des1.html">Baked Apple</A>)</I>
</P></H3></B>

<P>Have you ever wanted to be romantic on short notice, and all that's in the refrigerator is beer, salsa, and chicken salad?  It's difficult, when you live alone, to be frugal with your money, but at the same time be elegant.  I have devised a menu that provides romance with easy steps, a small amount of time, and little money.  Get ready for a menu that will enhance a romantic evening!</P>



<BR>







<B>

<P>8-10 oz. of beef sirloin tips (you will probably have to buy beef sirloin 	and have the butcher cut it into pieces for you)</P>




<P>Burgundy wine or other dry red wine</P>




<P>1 red pepper</P>




<P>1 green pepper</P>




<P>1 small onion (I suggest vidalia or a white onion)</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of butter</P>




<P>1 small package of baby carrots</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of honey
White rice (enough for two people)
1 beef boullion cube</P>



<BR>
<BR>



<P>Directions</P></B>




<P>1. Cut the peppers into thin strips and discard the seeds.  Then cut the onion into thin rings.  Place enough of each for two people into a skillet with the butter.  Saute' until the veggies are hot and partially cooked, but still a bit crisp (about five minutes).  Set aside.</P>




<P>2. Heat a skillet or wok on high heat and add the beef tips.  Cook briefly on all sides to brown (this seals in the juices).  Turn the heat to medium, then add 1/4 -1/2 cup of the burgundy wine and continue to cook until the beef is no longer pink in the center.</P>




<P>3. While the beef is cooking, follow the directions for the rice and get that started.  Add the boullion to the water according to the instructions.  This will flavor the rice quite nicely.  </P>






<P>4. Go back to the beef tips while the rice is doing its thing.  Add the sauteed veggies to the tips, season to taste with salt and pepper, and turn the heat to low.</P>





<P>5. Check the rice before you move to the carrots.</P>






<P>6. The fastest and easiest way to cook these carrots is going to be in the microwave.  Put the carrots, about a teaspoon of water, and a dash of salt into a microwave safe container.  Cover with plastic wrap, place in the microwave, and cook on high for about three minutes.  After this time, poke them with a fork to test them.  They are done whenever they are as tender as you like.  Drain off the water, and add the honey.  Place the plastic wrap back over the bowl and place back inside the microwave (do not turn it on...this just provides a place to keep the carrots warm).</P>




<P>7. Check the rice.  Check the beef tips.  If everything is hot and done, you are ready to plate it up and eat it.  **If the sauce with the beef tips seems too runny, take about 1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon of cornstarch, mix it with a bit of cold water (to form a paste), and stir it into the beef tip mix.  This will thicken the sauce.  Continue to cook just a few minutes longer, and then serve.</P>



<P>Bon Appetit!</P></B>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Chocolate Carmel Pecan Ice Cream Pie
</H2><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Here's a dessert that is perfect for company or just to enjoy all by yourself.  And guess what? It is sooooo easy!

<B>

<P>1 pre-made pie shell (graham or cookie)</P>





<P>1 quart vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt</P>





<P>1 small package chocolate chips</P>



<P>1  small package pecan pieces</P>





<P>1 jar carmel ice cream topping </P>

</B>
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Directions</B>



<P>1. Pull ice cream out of the freezer and allow to thaw on the counter for about 1/2 hour.</P>





<P>2. Open the pie shell, but leave it in the foil tin.</P>





<P>3. Melt 1/2 cup of chocolate chips over a hot-water bath or in the microwave.  </P>





<P>4. Spread the chocolate evenly over the bottom of the pie crust.  Put it in the refrigerator to harden the chocolate.
</P>




<P>5. Spread the ice cream into the pie shell (on top of the chocolate).  Use only enough to almost reach the top edge of the shell.</P>

 



<P>6. Pour the carmel over the ice cream and smooth.  You probably won't need all the topping.</P>





<P>7. Sprinkle the pecans on top.  You could also sprinkle chocolate chips on if you want.  Freeze for two hours.</P>





<P>To serve, use a warm, wet knife to slice through the pie.  Garnish with whipped cream and serve.</P>



<B>*</B>Hot chocolate or flavored coffee goes well with this.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Baked Apples</H2>

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P>This old favorite is a deceptively simple recipe. It makes a sweet, enticing desert, or a spicey treat any afternoon.</P>







<P>1.	Take your favorite apple, core it and peel the top half. 
</P>




<P>2.	Place in a oven-safe container just large enough to hold the apple.
</P>




<P>3.	Fill the center with 1 teaspoon of butter or margarine, 1 teaspoon<BR>
 brown sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon.
</P>




<P>4. 	Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Put apple in oven for 10 minutes. 
	Then baste the apple with the syrup in the bottom of the dish. </P>

	

<P>Bake for 10 more minutes.</P>







<P>5.	Repeat process until apple is tender when poked with a fork.</P>





<P>6.	Remove from oven carefully. Sprinkle more brown sugar if
 	desired.</P>


<P>Variations on a theme<BR>


Replace brown sugar with honey or omit the brown sugar and<BR>
 	cinnamon and fill the center with "red hot" candies.</P></B>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Your First Kitchen</H2>
<BR>
<BR>



<BLOCKQUOTE><P>As graduation approaches, we are all faced with the big questions.  How do I survive on my own?  What do I do?  What do I need?  Do I have what it takes to keep my underwear from turning pink in the washer?   Despite how huge the real world seems, it is possible to pull it into perspective.  Assuming your mother has helped you along until now, here is just a little more motherly advice to get you going. </P>

 



<P>The new apartment tenant must have a few things to survive in the kitchen.  Some people need more than others, but even if all you do is eat hot dogs and frozen dinners, I think the following will still apply.</P>





<P>The Absolutely Must-Have Kitchen Stuff</P>





<UL>
<LI> A small microwave (great for those frozen dinners and leftovers)
<LI>A paring knife and a chef knife (see the article in the May issue of ENTER)
<LI>Simple dishes (plates and bowls are a must; saucers and gravy boats are not)
<LI>Silverware (go for about 4 sets of knife, fork, spoon if you live alone)
<LI>Glasses (pickle and jelly jars work well here)
<LI> Basic spices (salt, pepper, cinnamon, etc.)
<LI> A sponge and dish soap (Do NOT use regular dish soap in dishwasher.  Use dishwasher soap, otherwise, you will be cleaning up suds for a long time.)
<LI> Plastic storage containers for leftovers (try Cool Whip containers and butter tubs)
<LI>One skillet and one saucepan (try to get a non-stick skillet)
<LI> A small four cup coffeepot (these also can make tea)
<LI> Dish towels and pot holders
<LI> Spoons and spatulas
</UL>




<P>As you get into your kitchen, you will probably want more than just these items, but these are the essentials.  Just think: if cavemen survived with sticks and rocks, you can survive with these simple basics.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT>f you are just starting out on your own, chances are you don't have much.  Any little bit of information can be helpful. Unless you are a chef, you probably don't know where to begin when it comes to buying knives.  Knives are essential for cutting, slicing, dicing and chopping. Now, if you plan to live off hot dogs, lunch meat and beer, knives will probably never enter your kitchen--nor will a date--but if you plan to eat well and survive on your own, here are a few tips.</P>





<P>There are many different brands of knives. Some come already boxed ($20-$30) and these are fine. But if you want something a bit more durable--something to last through the years--you will have to spend a bit more money. I'm referring to the knives that are sold individually. Sometimes they are boxed, but most often not. There are usually about a million to choose from, but these are the ones you will need to survive.</P>





<P>The first is the chef knife. This knife generally comes in 10" and 8".  Which size you choose is completely up to you--whatever feels most comfortable. Both knives serve the same purpose. The chef knife is good for slicing vegetables, cutting large portions of raw meat, chopping and dicing. It's one of the most important knives.</P>





<P>The next is the utility. This knife does most things the chef knife does, but is slightly smaller--usually 6" to 8". It's good for pantry work, such as preparing lettuce, fruits and so on. It's also good for carving poultry.</P>





<P>The paring knife--usually about 2" to 3"--is probably the most widely used knife in the home kitchen. It is small, versatile and can be more easily manipulated and maneuvered than the other two. Used mostly for trimming and paring fruits and vegetables, it can also be used as a baking tool for trimming pie doughs and cutting pasta. People find this to be most useful for smaller jobs (cutting strawberries, slicing celery, paring apples).  Because it is so small, it fits comfortably in your hand.</P>

  



<P>Don't let the salespeople talk you into a 17 piece set so they can get their comission. Buy what you want and need. You have to live with what you purchase, not the salesperson.  Keep your mind set and dive right in.</P>





<P>Things to remember when buying knives:</P>




<UL>
<LI>How much can you afford?
<LI>How will you use the knives?
<LI>Spend a little extra for quality--it's better in the long run.
<LI>How long do you want these knives to last?
</UL>



<P>Some of the most popular brands are Chicago Cutlery, Henckles, and Wustoff, although there are many other brands.</P>





<P>Prices range from $10 per knife to over $400 for top of the line. Just remember--whatever feels right. Hold the knife in your hand. If it doesn't feel right, don't buy it. Be sharp and don't get cut. Have fun!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG ALT="W"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="w2.jpeg">   ill Chalker, 10, of Indianapolis, is sold on indoor climbing, although he says he loves skiing and hockey more. Anne, Will's mother, recently threw a birthday party for Will and his friends at Climb Time. "It's hard on your hands," Will says. "My hands are all really red."</P>





<P>"Once you have a callus it doesn't hurt as much," his mom says. "It toughens you up." Will didn't look convinced.</P>

<P>Anne never felt she or her son were in peril as they climbed. "It's a wonderful way to get over your fear (of heights), I think," Anne says. </P>

<P>"You get to experience what climbing really is in a safe environment. It's also very fun."</P>

<P>A lot of people don't understand why we like to do it," Chris Bowman says. "You can only understand why once you've done it."</P>

<P>Bowman says he likes the challenge and sense of accomplishment, but perhaps the better answer is decades old. Shortly after climbing Mt. Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary was asked why. Why'd you do it, man?</P>





<P>To paraphrase the famous climber: "Because the plywood was there."        <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Fixing the bird</H2>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>Pumpkins, cider and Indian corn are vivid reminders that
the holidays are here. We pull out the turtlenecks and corduroy, the mittens
and scarves,
and all of the other traditional fall and winter customs that make this time
of year special.
The sweet potatoes, the pecan pie, and let's not forget the turkey.  The
turkey: how does
grandma get that golden, buttery turkey to turn out so well? Read along and
find out.

<P>There are a number of things to think about when planning a meal that
includes a turkey.
How many am I going to be feeding? Do I have storage space for a turkey? Can
I cook a
turkey? That would be the question. Don't be afraid. It really isn't as hard
as it sounds. 
Simply breathe deep and follow the directions.

<P>1. Figure out how many people you will need to serve. The size of the
turkey will depend on this. Most butchers are helpful and will guide you
to the bird you need.

<P>2. Make sure you have storage space for the turkey. It can't sit forever on
the
counter.

<P>3. Begin thawing the turkey <i>in the refrigerator</i> two to three days in
advance. Thawing in the refrigerator is safe and effective, but remember
that you have a large, dense bird. It will not thaw in just a few hours.
It needs time.

<P>4. The bird should be trussed when you get it. This means that the legs
and wings are tied against the body to ensure even cooking and an
attractive appearance. Do not cut this string until after the bird is
cooked. It significantly aids in the cooking.

<P>5.  Before cooking, rub the skin with oil or butter. This turns the skin a
beautiful golden brown and adds flavor.

<P>6. <i>Never</i>  put stuffing inside the turkey. During the cooking process,
the
inside of the cavity rarely reaches a temperature that will kill all of the
harmful bacteria that are found there. If stuffing is present, the
bacteria are transferred to it and then we eat them. These are harmful
bacteria that can cause serious damage.

<P>7. When testing for doneness, <i>always</i>  test the thickest part of the
thigh,
away form the bone. This is because the thigh is dark meat and it cooks
the slowest. So if the thickest part of dark meat on the turkey is done,
the whole bird is done.  The "done" temperature is 180 degrees F.
<P>8. <i>Always</i>  follow the directions, and if you have questions, ask your
butcher, not your neighbor. He gets paid to give out helpful information.
<P>9. <i>Never</i>  give the bones to your dog or cat. Just like chicken bones,
turkey bones splinter when chewed or broken and can cause serious damage to
an animal.

<P>I wish I could tell you how to cut it once it was out, but that
would mean illustrations or a demonstration. I don't know how to do
illustrations and I guess a demo is out of the question. So I will simply say
good luck.
After all, if you cooked the turkey yourself, the hard part is done. No one
is really going
to care how it looks when it is cut if it tastes good!  Now...go make your
pumpkin pie.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>he Christmas season in now over, but your bills may still linger. If you're staring at heavy monthly payments some tips from the Consumer Credit Counseling Service (800-388-2227) may help give you some relief.


<UL>
<P><LI>Know what you owe.  Track all of your spending, such as your credit and ATM transactions, and go through your checkbook register.</P>
<P><LI>Trim where possible.  Make a list of monthly spending and match it
against your current income.  Cut any expenses you can do without.</P>
<P><LI>Pay more than the minimum monthly payments.  The minimum payment may
only cover the interest rate and fail to chip away at the debt.  </P>
<P><LI>Increase your income.  If expenses are exceeding your income, consider working
overtime or taking an extra job to keep up. </P> 
<P><LI>Consider bankruptcy <I>only</I> as a last resort.</P>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>What do you eat on the go? Is it scary to think about? Most fast-food junkies should find their diets more frightening than dirty gym socks. When you're on the run, you have to get what you can when you can, right? Wrong. Many of you are back in school, dashing from one side of campus to the other, and now is the time to learn how to keep eating healthy when time is lacking.

Here are a few rules for when you're "on the run."



<P><B>Rule #1: Plan Ahead:</B> Make a list before heading to the store. Think about your needs "on the go" as well as those for dinner. What can you pop in your bag that is satisfying but quick and healthy? Try some of these:</P>



<UL>
<LI>Fresh fruit: apples, oranges, bananas
<LI>Cereal bars: lots of flavors
<LI>Granola bars: energy on the run
<LI>Cereal-throw some in a baggy and voila! A healthy snack
<LI>Dried fruit-apricots, raisins, cranberries, etc.
<LI>Baby carrots: quick, crunchy, and healthy
<LI>Jerky: turkey, beef, whatever
<LI>Vegetable juice in a can
</UL>





<P>Before you go to bed, put one or more of these items in your backpack or purse, so you'll be prepared in your rush the next morning.</P>



<B>

<P>Rule #2: Be Prepared:</B> Keep something extra with you or in your car for those times when you don't get a lunch break. Eat your stash instead of a vending-machine "sugar glob." Even if the snack will not hold you until dinner, it will hold you until nutrition can be found in something other than a chocolate bar and a cola.</P>



<B>

<P>Rule #3: Be Smart:</B> There are times when either our stores have been depleted or we were too sleepy the night before to remember our "instant energy." Sometimes it's impossible to do anything besides fast food. In this case, be sensible and feel better about your choice. A number of places now have salad bars, grilled or roasted items, and some even have "light" menus. Use common sense...unless you left that at home with the granola bar.</P>





<P>Being on the go is rough, but eating smart can be easy. Plan ahead, be prepared and be smart. It's a lot cheaper to buy a box of eight cereal bars at the grocery than to buy eight cereal bars from a vending machine. Spend that hard earned cash on something else... like running shoes for those mad dashes across campus.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Peppermint Bark</H2>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B>Ingredients:
<P>2 packages of white bakers chocolate (not coating chocolate)

<P>5 candy canes

<P>peppermint extract (optional)

</P>
<BR>
<P>Directions:</b>
<P>1. Place all the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and put in the microwave.
Heat the
chocolate at one-minute intervals. After each time, stir and then rotate the
bowl a quarter
turn and place back in the microwave. When the chocolate is liquid with
chocolate
lumps, cut the time to 30-second intervals. When totally melted, remove and
set aside.</P>

<P>2. Unwrap the candy canes and put them in a plastic baggy. Gently smash the
candy into
pieces with a hammer. You do not want big chunks, but you don't want dust.
Small
pieces are ideal. A little dust is okay, though.

<P>3. Gently stir the candy-cane bits into the chocolate. Add a few drops of
peppermint extract here if desired.

<P>4. On a sheet pan covered in waxed paper or parchment paper, pour the
chocolate and
carefully spread with a spatula to a thin sheet.

<P>5. Allow to chill in the refrigerator overnight and then break into bite-size
pieces. Give to
others to enjoy for the holidays.</P>

<P><B>Editor's note:</B> 
<P>These do not need refrigeration after hardened.</P>

<P><b>Variations:</b></P>
<P>-Try semi sweet or milk chocolate with any kind of nut you like (whole or
chopped).
<P>-Add dried, chopped fruit to the chocolate.
<P>-Stir in broken pretzel pieces.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>Y</FONT>ou almost didn't get the December issue of ENTER. Mr. Potter was makin' a
fuss about our dusty ol' magazine. And some of us were feeling depressed,
even suicidal. Then we snapped out of it,  beat the crap outta old man
Potter, and here we are.</P>

<P>We know how many lives we touch. We just don't know where the hell did we put
Zuzu's petals.

<P>The rest of the World Wide Web may take the holidays off, but the gang at
ENTER is dedicated to your life and career. For example, we cut our office
Christmas party short after three days. That's dedication. Speaking of booze,
check out our story on <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/dec/play/drinks/drinks1.html">funky mixed drinks</A>. Mr. Gower would be proud. And if
you're stuck for gift ideas, may we suggest something from Cassandra Anderson's
story on <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/dec/play/xxxmas/xxxmas1.html">adult playthings</A>.

<P>As always, ENTER is dedicated to bringing you serious journalism you need to
make the successful transition from carefree college senior to taxpayin'
maniac. Minority or not, you'll want to read our look at <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/dec/features/fair/fair1.html">job discrimination</A>.
And you may want to take some time off after you read our story on <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/dec/work/stress/stress1.html">stress</A> in
the workplace. <i>Money Magazine's</i>  Jordan Goodman will tell you how to
invest your millions (or hundreds) in an eye-opening <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/dec/carsncash/moneyman/mm1.html">interview</A> George Bailey
would love. It's the kind of award-winning stuff you've come to expect from
us, our Christmas gift to you.

<P>Finally, our good friend Clarence says every time a modem rings, an angel
gets his wings. What a nice thought. Happy holidays.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Broiled Basil Chicken, Autumn Squash, and Poppyseed Croissants</H2>

<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>

<P>For the chicken:</P>





<P>1 chicken breast (boneless, skinless, halved)</P>





<P>1/4 cup of soy sauce
</P>




<P>1 tablespoon fresh chopped basil</P>





<P>1 clove of garlic (crushed and finely chopped)</P>





<P>1 teaspoon of chopped parsley</P>


<BR>



<P>For the squash:</P>





<P>1/2 of a butternut squash (save the other half)</P>





<P>1/4 cup of butter</P>





<P>1/4 cup of brown sugar</P>



<BR>


<P>For the rolls:</P>





<P>1 package of refrigerator croissant rolls</P>





<P>1 tablespoon of poppyseeds</P>





<P>melted butter</P>

</B>
<BR><BR>


<P><B>Directions</B></P>





<P>1. Baste the chicken with the soy sauce.</P>





<P>2. Mix the basil, garlic and parsley together.</P>





<P>3. Sprinkle the chicken with this herb mixture, and then set aside for the
moment.</P>





<P>4. Remove the skin and seeds from the squash. Then chop it into small
cubes (about 1/2 inch) and put them into a 9 inch-by-9 inch oven-safe baking.</P>





<P>5. Pour melted butter over the pieces and sprinkle with the brown sugar.
Cover with plastic wrap and put into the microwave for about 5 minutes.
Check for doneness with a fork and continue this process until edible.</P>





<P>6. While the squash is cooking, put the chicken on an oiled roasting rack
and put it in the oven. The oven should be set to broil (never close the
door during broiling). Cook until no longer pink in the center.</P>





<P>7. Keep the squash in the microwave until dinner. While the chicken is
doing its thing, follow the directions for the croissants and place them on
a sheet pan spritzed with pan spray. Gently brush the tops of the unbaked
dough with melted butted and generously sprinkle with poppyseeds. When the
chicken is done, turn the oven on to the correct temperature for the rolls
and proceed. Serve everything hot and enjoy!</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>C</FONT>hristmas is the time that everyone enjoys family and traditions. Along with
the annual
tree selection and the holiday bake-off, there are many other things that
make the season
special. Spiced cider, hollyberries, mistletoe, stockings and snow are just a
few of the
things that create the magical feeling of Christmas.

<P>However, along with Christmas comes expenses. I know there are things I would
love to
do during the season, but can't afford. I have come up with some ideas to
make the
money stretch a bit during the holidays. I save my money for outings and that
special
someone's gift and use my homemade decorating ideas to not only save money,
but to
spend time with family. Its a great way to pass an afternoon with the kids!

<P>Here are some things to do when it is cold outside:
1. Pop some popcorn. Gather some thread and needles. String the popcorn onto
the thread
to create a pretty garland for the tree or put it on a bush outside for the
birds (make sure
that the popcorn is unsalted and unbuttered). Add cranberries to the strand
for color.
Make sure the kids are old enough to handle a needle.

<P>2. Bake some gingerbread cookies and use them as tree decorations. Before
baking, use a
drinking straw to cut a hole near the top to the cookie so that after baking,
it can be
threaded with ribbon for hanging on the tree. Also, before baking, decorate
with red hots,
raisins etc.

<P>3. Take those holiday greeting cards and make ornaments out of them. Use
cookie cutters
to trace a design, then cut it out. Use a hole punch to allow for a ribbon
hanger.

<P>4. Tie several cinnamon sticks together with wide ribbon and use as a
decoration anywhere. They smell so nice!

<P>5. Buy or dry your own apple and orange slices. Then glue a pretty ribbon
onto them and
decorate the tree.

<P>6. Decorate with dried flowers.

<P>7. Buy raffia (a straw-like ribbon) at any craft store and tie bows onto your
tree.

<P>8. If you are a pet lover, take dog bones and carefully drill a little hole
in the top of each.
String with colorful ribbon and tie on a wreath or the tree, but be careful
that the dog
does not try to knock the tree down to get them!

<P>9. Glue any number of things onto clothespins and clip on the tree, or
anywhere. Try
using pinecones decorated with fake snow or glitter and glue.

<P>10. Tie a loop of ribbon to the top of a pinecone. Cover the pinecone in
peanut butter and
then roll in birdseed. Tie it outside on a tree branch and watch the birds
come.

<P>There are so many other ways to celebrate the season at little expense, but
hopefully
these ideas will get you started. Enjoy your own traditions and your own
families and
have a very merry Christmas!

</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B>Apple Rosemary Pork with Broiled Tomatoes and Buttered Orzo:</B></H2><BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>For the pork: 2 1-inch pork chops (bone in)</P>

<P>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped</P>

<P>1 Granny Smith apple cored, peeled and chopped</P>

<P>1/2 cup chicken broth</P>

<P>1/2 cup apple juice</P>

<P>For the tomatoes: 1 large, red tomato</P>

<P>2 tablespoons light brown sugar (white will work too)</P>

<P>1/2 teaspoon dried or 1 teaspoon fresh basil</P>

<P>For the orzo: 1 cup of orzo (orzo is pasta shaped like grains of rice)<

butter, salt and pepper:</B></P>

<BR>
<BR>



<FONT SIZE=4><P><B>Directions</B></P></FONT>


<P>1. Combine broth, juice and rosemary in a shallow dish. Add pork and turn to coat. Refrigerate for about 20 minutes. Prepare the ingredients for the others, but do not cook them yet.</P>





<P>2. Measure out the orzo and set aside.</P>





<P>3. Core the tomato and slice it crosswise into halves. Set each half, cut side up, on an oven-proof dish. Top each with 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. Set aside.</P>





<P>4. Place chops on the rack of a roasting pan and place the rack in the pan. Place in an oven set at 375 degrees F. for about 20 minutes.</P>





<P>5. After the 20 minutes is up, baste the chops with the remaining marinade. Return to the oven at 400 degrees F. for about 20 more minutes.</P>





<P>6. Put the rest of the marinade in a sauce pan or skillet and add the apples. Cook on medium heat until the apples are tender. Set aside.</P>



7. At 10 minutes, cook the orzo according to the directions and season 

<P>with butter, salt and pepper. Keep in a warm spot.</P>





<P>8. Pull the chops out of the oven, making sure that they are completely cooked and not raw, and set them aside for the moment.</P>





<P>9. Turn on the broiler in your oven, put the tomatoes in (low in the oven) and remove only when the sugar is melted and golden brown. Top with 1 teaspoon of butter and chopped basil.</P>





<P>10. Serve by placing the orzo on one side of the plate and nestling the tomato half into it (this keeps the tomato from sliding around). Then put the pork chop on the plate and top with the hot apple marinade.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>H</FONT>appy New Year. Make 1997 your best ever.</P>


<P>Our only resolution for the new year is to help you become a confident,
successful
working professional. Unlike our friends who resolve to lose twenty pounds
or quit
smoking, we make resolutions we know we can keep. </P>


<P>College seniors know they can count on ENTER Magazine to give them the
stories they
need to get their careers off on the right foot. Eager young workers know
they can rely on
us for the information they need to keep their careers smoking. And our Net
peers
acknowledged ENTER's reputation for solid, reliable journalism with several
honors in
1996, and we expect that trend will continue in the new year.</P>


<P>We want you to land the job you want. In this special issue we present our
comprehensive Job Forecast for 1997, an interactive look at the hottest
careers around the
country. Also, it may sound a little ironic coming from ENTER, but we show
you the
right way to <i>quit</i>  your job. And does your resume suffer if you've had
several jobs
in a short period of time? We let you know.

<P>If you're hoping to make a little more money in 1997 with a raise, you'll want to read Putting More Dead Presidents In Your Pocket . And our regular
features
round out one helluva great January issue.</P>


<P>Finally, we begin 1997 with two new members of the ENTER family. Melissa
Daimler, a
New York-based career coach, will write Career FAQ, a regular column that
will answer
reader's job questions. And Massachusetts-based Jason R. Rich, author of
<i><A HREF="http://www.firstjob.com">First Job,
Great Job</A></i>, will cover career-related stories and issues. It's good to
have them aboard.
</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Cranberry Turkey, Sweet Potato Chips and Spinach Walnut Salad</H2>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Ingredients: </P></B>



<P>For the turkey:</P>

<B><P>1 breast of turkey</P>

<P>1 can of whole berry cranberry sauce</P>

<P>1 orange</P></B>
<BR>

<P>For the sweet potato chips:</P>

<B><P>1 sweet potato</P>

<P>butter</P>

<P>brown sugar</P></B>
<BR>

<P>For the salad:</P>

<B><P>fresh spinach leaves</P>

<P>1 small package of chopped walnuts</P>

<P>3 tablespoons of salad oil</P>

<P>juice of 1 orange </P>
<BR>

Directions:</B>
<P>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut the sweet potato into 
circles or chips about 1/4 inch thick. Arrange these chips onto a
well-greased sheet pan. 
Lightly brush each with oil. Put the pan into the 
oven and close the door. Set the timer for ten minutes.</P>

<P>2. Put the turkey breast into a skillet and, over medium heat, 
brown the breast on all sides, and then cover the pan. The turkey must 
be white, not pink, in the center to ensure it is fully cooked.</P>

<P>3. Check on the chips. If they are soft when poked with a fork, and 
especially if they are starting to brown, turn them over and brush 
lightly with oil. Watch carefully. You don't want to burn them.</P>

<P>4. Peel the orange, but do not throw away the peel. Carefully cut the 
colored peel away from the white part. Chop it (the orange-colored 
part) very fine and toss into a small saucepan with the cranberry sauce.  
Over low heat, warm the sauce.</P>

<P>5. Remove the turkey from the burner if done. Check the chips. If they 
are soft when poked and browning nicely, remove from the oven and 
turn the broiler on. Brush all of the chips with butter, sprinkle with 
brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. Return to the oven, watching <I>very</I> carefully. 
You only want the brown sugar to melt and bubble a bit. Then they are done.</P>

<P>6. Carefully cut the breast on a bias into thin pieces. Toss the pieces 
into the pan with the cranberry sauce.</P>

<P>7. Rip the spinach into bite sized pieces. Toss in about 2 tablespoons 
of walnuts. Whisk together the oil and the orange juice. Pour over 
the greens and mix to coat.</P>

<P>8. Place 3 or 4 chips on the plate, fanned out. Next to it, put a small 
portion of the salad, and then comes the turkey. Spoon a small bed of 
the cranberry sauce onto the plate. Neatly arrange several pieces of 
the turkey breast onto the sauce.</P>

<A NAME="Making Queries"></A><H3>Making Queries</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Excite for Web Servers gives web users access to a sophisticated concept-based
searching engine. But even though the search engine is advanced, users
can form queries without using a complicated query language. This page
will help you to choose the queries that will give you the best
results.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="Query Basics"></A><H3>Query Basics</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>A query is simply a description of an information need. Unlike Boolean
systems that search for just those documents containing <I>all</I> the
words in your query, Excite for Web Servers will search for documents that are a
best match for the words in your query. Excite for Web Servers will also search for
documents that are about the same concepts that your query describes,
so sometimes Excite for Web Servers will bring back articles that don't mention
<I>any</I> of the words in your original query.</P>
<P>
What this means is that your query -- the description of your
information need -- can be as detailed as you like. Don't worry about
providing too many words; the more words, the better. Additional words
in your query will help Excite for Web Servers figure out what concepts you're
really interested in. On the other hand, Excite for Web Servers will do a pretty
good job of figuring out what documents are interesting to you even if
your query is vague.</P>
<P>
For example, let's say you're searching a web site for documents about
customer support for the Widget2000 product you're using. A good
starting point would be</P>
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Widget2000
</PRE>

If you have a question about a particular feature of the Widget2000,
for example the Blurfl upgrade package, you might choose a query like
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Blurfl upgrade package
        of the Widget2000
</PRE>

Even if there are no documents that are actually about the Blurfl
upgrade, Excite for Web Servers will still show you documents about Widget2000
customer support.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="Advanced Query Tips"></A><H2>Advanced Query Tips</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of
Excite for Web Servers.</P>

<BR><P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Only use words that are relevant to your query</B><DD>
If you're looking for documents about the Widget2000, don't enter a
query like "<CODE>Find me all documents about the Widget2000</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers
considers <I>all</I> the words in your query to be part of your
information need, so queries like the previous example will find all
documents about <I>finding all documents about</I> the Widget2000, which
may not be exactly what you want.</P>
<P>
<DT><B>Specify multiple forms of the same phrases</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers distinguishes between hyphenated and un-hyphenated words. So,
sometimes it might be necessary to explicitly say that you want both
versions, for example "<CODE>CDROM CD-ROM</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers will try to figure
out that <CODE>CDROM</CODE> and <CODE>CD-ROM</CODE> are the same, but it never hurts to
explicitly specify multiple forms.</P>
<P>
<DT><B>Common words are ignored</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers doesn't index common words like <I>a</I>, <I>and</I>, or <I>the</I>.
Consequently, those words in your query will be ignored. Excite for Web Servers also
ignores numbers; however, it can find strings that happen to contain a
number, for example <I>3Com</I>.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Cheeseburger Potato</H2>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B>Ingredients:
<P>1 large baking potato

<P>1/4 pound of ground beef

<P>Cheese sauce

<P>1 teaspoon of dried onion

<P>Chili powder, cayenne pepper, hot sauce (all optional)

</P>
<BR>
<P>Directions:</b>
<P>1. Poke holes in the potato on all sides. Put it in the microwave at
three-minute intervals.
Check after each with a fork to check for doneness.

<P>2. Brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium high heat until no longer
pink. Use a
spatula to chop up the beef so that it is not in big, chunky pieces. Dump the
meat into a
strainer and run HOT water over it to remove excess fat. Return to the
skillet and turn the
heat to low. Add the onion and continue to cook for another 2 or 3 minutes.
Remove
from heat.

<P>3. Take the now done potato out of the microwave and put on a plate. Cut
however you
like and top with as much of the ground beef as desired. Put the rest in the
refrigerator for
the next time.

<P>4. Put the cheese sauce in the microwave and heat as directed.  Pour desired
amount over
the potato. Sprinkle lightly with desired spices and enjoy!</P>

<BR>
<P><b>Editor's note:</b></P> If desired, add the spices to the ground beef with the onions.
Be
careful! A little spice goes a long way!

</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Veggie Sub</H2>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Yield:</B>  Serves 2</P>
<P><B>Ingredients:</B>
</P>
<B><P>2 sub buns</P>

<P>1 head of red- or green-leaf lettuce</P>

<P>1 red tomato</P>

<P>1 sweet onion</P>

<P>1 yellow pepper</P>



<P>4 thin slices of cheese (your choice)</P>





<P>1/4 cup of low-fat or no-fat sour cream</P>





<P>1/2 teaspoon dried dill</P>





<P>salt</P>





<P>pepper</P>

</B>

Directions:


<P>1. Clean the lettuce under cold water. Promptly refrigerate any you 
will not use.</P>





<P>2. Cut the tomato into thick slices. Two slices per sandwich.</P>





<P>3. Cut the onion and pepper into thick rings. Make sure to get the 
seeds out of the pepper--they are bitter.</P>





<P>4. Mix the sour cream and the dill together. Spread evenly onto the sub 
buns. </P>

 



<P>5.  Pile the ingredients onto the buns in whatever order you like.  
Season with salt and pepper if desired.</P>





<P><B>(Attention vegans)</B><BR>

If you are vegan (people who don't eat anything that comes from an 
animal--cheese, sour cream, etc.), you can still enjoy this sandwich.  
Check the ingredient label on the bread to make sure it was not made 
with any animal fat or honey. Omit the sour cream and instead use 
Italian dressing on the sub bun.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Chocolate Carmel Pecan Ice Cream Pie
</H2><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Here's a dessert that is perfect for company or just to enjoy all by yourself.  And guess what? It is sooooo easy!

<B>

<P>1 pre-made pie shell (graham or cookie)</P>





<P>1 quart vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt</P>





<P>1 small package chocolate chips</P>



<P>1  small package pecan pieces</P>





<P>1 jar carmel ice cream topping </P>

</B>
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Directions</B>



<P>1. Pull ice cream out of the freezer and allow to thaw on the counter for about 1/2 hour.</P>





<P>2. Open the pie shell, but leave it in the foil tin.</P>





<P>3. Melt 1/2 cup of chocolate chips over a hot-water bath or in the microwave.  </P>





<P>4. Spread the chocolate evenly over the bottom of the pie crust.  Put it in the refrigerator to harden the chocolate.
</P>




<P>5. Spread the ice cream into the pie shell (on top of the chocolate).  Use only enough to almost reach the top edge of the shell.</P>

 



<P>6. Pour the carmel over the ice cream and smooth.  You probably won't need all the topping.</P>





<P>7. Sprinkle the pecans on top.  You could also sprinkle chocolate chips on if you want.  Freeze for two hours.</P>





<P>To serve, use a warm, wet knife to slice through the pie.  Garnish with whipped cream and serve.</P>



<B>*</B>Hot chocolate or flavored coffee goes well with this.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Creamy Chicken Pasta</H2>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Ingredients:
</P>
<P>2 chicken breasts
</P>
<P>2 cans of low-fat cream of chicken soup
</P>
<P>1 red pepper
</P>
<P>1 yellow pepper
</P>
<P>1/2 teaspoon of thyme
</P>
<P>1/2 teaspoon of rosemary
</P>
<P>1 box of rotini pasta (spirals)</P>

<P>parmesan</P>

<P>salt</P>

<P>pepper</P>
<BR>

<P>Directions:</P></B>
<P>1. Cut the peppers up. Scoop out and discard the seeds. Then cut the 
peppers into small pieces that are easily edible with a fork. Set 
aside.</P>

<P>2. After cutting the fat from the chicken, cut each breast into thin 
strips. Place these strips into a 10- or 12-inch skillet sprayed with 
cooking oil. Add the peppers to the chicken. Over medium heat, cook 
the chicken until no longer pink on any side and the peppers are tender.</P>

<P>3. Following the directions on the soup can, pour the soup (and water if 
the soup is condensed) over the chicken. Add the thyme and rosemary. Stir to
incorporate. Turn the heat down to low and continue to cook.</P>

<P>4. Prepare the box of pasta following directions on the box.</P>

<P>5. When the pasta is done, drain and blend it with the chicken mixture 
(the skillet may be to small for this so a larger bowl may be needed 
for this).</P>

<P>6. Portion onto plates and serve piping hot.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Butternut Squash with Herbed Rice</H2>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B>Ingredients:
<P>1 butternut squash

<P>2 cups of rice, brown or white

<P>1/4 cup of brown sugar

<P>1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

<P>2 tablespoons butter (melted)

<P>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
</P>
<BR>
<P>Directions:</b>
<P>1. Cut the squash lengthwise down the middle. Scoop out and discard the
seeds. Use a
melon baller to remove the inside flesh into nice round spheres. Discard the
skins.

<P>2. In a bowl (microwave safe), put the squash, brown sugar, cinnamon and
butter. Mix
everything together until well coated. Put plastic wrap over the entire bowl
and seal all
edges.

<P>3. Put the bowl into the microwave at 3 minute intervals, checking each time
with a fork
to see if the squash is tender. Make sure after checking, to tightly wrap
again before
returning the bowl to the microwave.

<P>4. While the microwave is doing its thing, prepare the rice according to
package
directions. Add the parsley to the water before adding the rice. If desired,
also add a
tablespoon of butter to the water.

<P>5. When the squash is done and the rice is finished, you are ready to serve.
Place about 1
cup of the rice on a plate. Before adding the squash, mix it to coat evenly
with the brown
sugar syrup. Place about 1 cup of the squash on top of the rice. Pour the
reserve brown
sugar syrup into a gravy boat and set on the table for anyone that wants more
of it.

<P>6. Sprinkle the top of each plate with about 1 tablespoon of chopped pecans.
Enjoy
piping hot!</P>

<BR>
<P><b>Serving suggestions:</b></P>
<P>Try a simple green salad on the side with cranberries and light dressing.
Editor's note: For a Vegan meal, use margarine instead of butter.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>As fall approaches, so does the desire for cozy campfires. Here is an
all-time favorite that
tempts the mouth and pleases the tummy.</P>




<B><P>Graham crackers</P>





<P>Large marshmallows or marshmallow cream</P>





<P>Chocolate bars</P>





<P>Tin foil</B></P>




<P><B>Directions:</B></P>



<P>1. Make sure your fire is going and it's nice and hot.</P>





<P>2. Rip off a piece of tin foil about one-and-a-half feet long.</P>





<P>3. Take one rectangle of Graham cracker and break it in half so that you
now have two squares. Set one of the squares in the center of the foil.
Set the other aside for the moment.</P>





<P>4. Unwrap a chocolate bar and break it in half.  Put one half on one side
of the Graham cracker. Let someone else have the other half for their
S'more.</P>





<P>5. Take one or two marshmallows (depending on how gooey you like 'em)
and put them on a stick. Carefully brown them over the fire, taking care
not to catch them on fire, unless you like your marshmallow blackened.
Remove them from the stick and put them carefully on top of the chocolate
and put the other Graham cracker on top.</P>





<P>6. Now wrap the S'more in the foil and gently place in at the base of the
fire (in warm ashes) or on a rack that sits above the flame. This will
melt the chocolate and warm the snack.</P>





<P>7. Unwrap and enjoy!</P>





<P>NOTE: If this is being done with children or indoors instead of in front of
a fire, marshmallow cream may be spread on the Graham cracker in place of
roasting the marshmallows inside.  Then place the wrapped sweet into a
250-degree
Fahrenheit oven for just a few minutes.  Please do not put the foil
into the microwave. The metal could damage the microwave.</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="privatecap.gif" ALT="I"><BR>f you pass the preliminaries then get ready for firearms training.
According to Gonzalez the training was basically the same class FBI
agents take. "Everything we did in this class was about saving your life,"
says Gonzalez. "It was very serious and very frightening, because (you
learn) little
statistics like if someone is 21 feet away from you it takes them 1.5
seconds to get at you so you have to shoot."</P>

<P>Shooting somebody in the movies and shooting them in real life are two
different things.
According to Gonzalez, "With an average 9 mm weapon, you would have to shoot
them
seven times to make somebody
drop, unless you hit a totally vital zone."</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="privatequote.gif">Boiled down to the basics, being a private detective requires a lot of
listening. "You can hear a lot if you keep your ears open," says Gonzalez.
And a lot of the administrative part of being a private detective is
"locates," but finding a person for one reason or another presents its own
set of problems. It "gets to be a very tricky thing because you have to
develop a motive of the person who is hiring you. Why is
this person coming to us and wanting to locate this person. What kind of
harm could they possibly do? What are their intentions?"</P>

<P>Your clients are sometimes just as interesting as the people you're going
after. "There was an old PI in the business, he had
said once, 'Most of the people who hire PIs either need priests, lawyers
or shrinks, but they come to us instead.'" And unlike the police
department or the FBI--where you keep going and going until you catch the
person--a
PI is limited to the price your client can pay for your services.
"They're (the client) gonna say, 'We want you to try and get him and our
budget is $500,'" says Gonzalez.</P>


<P>You're new job as a PI also may require that you strap on a helmet and
get ready to pursue a suspect through traffic at high speeds. According to Gonzalez 
there were a
lot of car chases, and one she was involved in hit
speeds of 105 mph in traffic. But as exciting as it gets, there's the
downside. "You're always dealing with the lowest possible human emotions,
primal emotions. People not wanting to be caught and people doing anything
to not be caught," says Gonzalez.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Baked Apples</H2>

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P>This old favorite is a deceptively simple recipe. It makes a sweet, enticing desert, or a spicey treat any afternoon.</P>







<P>1.	Take your favorite apple, core it and peel the top half. 
</P>




<P>2.	Place in a oven-safe container just large enough to hold the apple.
</P>




<P>3.	Fill the center with 1 teaspoon of butter or margarine, 1 teaspoon<BR>
 brown sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon.
</P>




<P>4. 	Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Put apple in oven for 10 minutes. 
	Then baste the apple with the syrup in the bottom of the dish. </P>

	

<P>Bake for 10 more minutes.</P>







<P>5.	Repeat process until apple is tender when poked with a fork.</P>





<P>6.	Remove from oven carefully. Sprinkle more brown sugar if
 	desired.</P>


<P>Variations on a theme<BR>


Replace brown sugar with honey or omit the brown sugar and<BR>
 	cinnamon and fill the center with "red hot" candies.</P></B>

It means there will be long lines at every ATM machine. It means at least
three football players will be suspended for (you pick) shoplifting, drunk
driving or beating up their girlfriends, but they'll be rehabilitated (and
thus reactivated) in time to play in a meaningless bowl game in January. And
it means your beloved Enter Magazine, that Internet juggernaut, is here to
make all your college boo-boos better.</P>



<P>If you're already outta school, that's cool. Enter Magazine is an Equal
Opportunity Educator. Read on.</P>





<P>You bust your hump for four years or more to get a degree. Do you need an
advanced degree? Are you ready to ride the tram to CareerLand? How much is
that B.A. or B.S. worth? Read <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/sept/features/degree/degree1.html">our story</A> this month before making your
decision.</P>





<P>Mom might think that stuff in your closet is crap, but that stuffed swordfish
you bought in Daytona last spring break means a lot to you. Protect that
fish--and the rest of your garbage--by reading <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/sept/carsncash/premprtx/premprtx1.html">our killer story</A> on renter's
insurance.</P>





<P>And we discuss the sensitive side of sex in a <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/sept/features/drjudy/drjudy1.html">revealing interview</A> with that star of <I>Love Phones</I>, Dr. Judy Kuriansky.</P>





<P>All that plus a whole lot <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/">more</A>. Now hurry. You don't want to miss the bus.</P>

<P><IMG  ALIGN=LEFT SRC="privatehead.gif" ALT="So You Wanna Be a...Private Detective">

<BR><BR><BR><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/tellus.html">By Andrew Vitale</A></P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="privatecap.gif" ALT="I"><BR>magine writing this letter back home:</P>

<P><i>I found a great job! No need to worry anymore. Today I strapped a 9 mm to
my side,
threw on my long overcoat (you know, the one I got
for my birthday) with a hidden camera inside and wore a pager. I followed
this guy who's wanted in seven states and snapped some photos
of him in a bar downtown. I had to use some of the money you sent me to
buy information from some guy missing a hand and one eye, but he was very
helpful. I think I can finally wrap up this case soon, but I need to bug
the suspect's apartment so I can get some evidence for court.

<P>Anyway, things are fine. Enjoying life after college. See ya soon and love
you all.</i></P>

<P>The movies, books and television shows are not far from the truth. Being a
private detective, according to Lauren Gonzalez, a former PI,  is like the
high-drama on the screen. "I think it's the subject matter. You're dealing
with people who are trying to get away with something and they're being
hunted, literally," says Gonzalez.</P>

<P>After graduating from college with a degree in journalism, Gonzalez wanted
to pursue a career in investigative reporting and was drawn to private
investigating to gather the necessary experience. She found several private
detective
agencies and landed a
very excruciating interview. "It was a painful interview," says Gonzalez,
who is currently
an editor at <i>Internet Underground</i> magazine. "It was painful in the
sense that he
was interrogating me, he didn't know
how to turn that off. I'm like, 'Wait a minute, I'm here to work for you. I
didn't do anything wrong.'"</P>

<P>Unlike most jobs, if you haven't been in jail or arrested you may not be
cut out to be a private detective. When asked if she had
ever been in jail, she replied no, which worried her soon-to-be boss.
"He said, 'I'm afraid you're going to be intimidated by cops," says
Gonzalez. And contrary to most types of employment, lying pays, not honesty.</P>

<P>The job Gonzalez landed was at a full-service detective agency
where she handled criminal, insurance, personal and domestic
investigations--and even
bodyguard work. It included everything down to even
analyzing fluid samples, blood samples and forensic work.</P>

<P>If you're terrified that browsing the Internet may give away your identity,
then the
extensive background check you'll have to go through after the interview may
not make
the job appealing. According to Gonzalez, you'll need an FBI background
check, a credit
check and you'll be fingerprinted. But it's all done for a reason, because
part of your job
will be going to court to testify. And the PI agency needs to know
everything about you
before the opposing lawyer learns it and crucifies you
on the stand.</P>

<P>"You could have been in prison. That's fine," says Gonzalez. "There's plenty of
PIs that have pretty jaded pasts, but if you're on the up and up about
it, and there's no secret records that pop up, that's fine."</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Stuffed Peppers</H2>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B>Ingredients:
<P>4 peppers (red, yellow or green)

<P>1/2 pound of ground beef

<P>1 can red beans

<P>2 cups of cooked rice (1 cup uncooked)

<P>1 cup grated cheese of choice

<P>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

<P>1/4 cup fine chopped onion

<P>1 teaspoon parsley

</P>
<BR>
<P>Directions:</b>
<P>1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Cook the rice according to package
directions.

<P>2. Cut the top off of the peppers and discard. With your fingers, remove the
white inner
core of each pepper and the seeds. Set aside.

<P>3. Drain and rinse the beans. In a bowl, combine the beans, cayenne pepper,
cheese and
onion. Set aside.

<P>4. Over medium-high heat, brown the beef in a skillet until no longer pink.
Use a spatula
to chop the meat up so that it is not in big, chunky pieces. When brown, dump
into a
strainer and run HOT water over it to remove the excess fat. Add this to the
bean
mixture.

<P>5. When the rice is done, add it to the bean mixture too. Mix all together
well. Taste it to
determine if it needs salt, pepper or otherwise. If okay, stuff each of the
hollow peppers
with the bean mixture. Pack them tight. If there is extra cheese, sprinkle
the top of each
one with it.

<P>6. Place the peppers in an oven safe dish and put into the oven. Bake until
the peppers are
tender, but not squishy. The whole should be hot and the cheese browned.
Remove from
the oven and serve.</P>



<BR>
<P><b>Serving suggestions:</b></P> Accompany with fresh veggies (carrots, peas, beans, etc.), a small side
salad, or maybe
some fresh bread with marinara sauce.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Summer Vegetable Salad</H2>				

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>H</FONT>ere's another French recipe modified for healthier eating. This one would be wonderful on a summer picnic or a family pitch-in.</P>








<P><B>1 cup of diced carrots</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of diced celery</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of shelled peas or lima beans</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of green beans</B></P>





<P><B>1 cup of yellow pepper</B></P>





<P><B>4 or 5 tablespoons of red or white wine vinegar salad dressing (low-fat or fat-free is best)</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 cup of low-fat or fat-free mayonnaise (Miracle Whip works too)
salt and pepper, if desired</B></P>


<BR>
<BR>



<P><B>Directions:</B></P>





<P>1. Dice the carrots and celery into pieces the size of peas. Shell the peas and discard the shells--unless you want to nibble on them while you are preparing the salad.  Next, break off the head and tail of the beans and break each into 1/2-inch pieces. Peel the pepper, if desired, discard the seeds, and cut into pieces the size of peas.</P>





<P>2. Put the carrot and the celery in cold, salted (about 1/4 teaspoon) water and bring to a boil. Simmer for about 10 minutes or until tender when poked with a fork. Drain and set aside.</P>





<P>3. Boil the peas and green beans in salted (about 1/4 teaspoon) water for about 6 minutes or until they are just tender when poked with a fork. Drain and immediately put them into a tub of cold water (this stops the cooking).  Then drain and set aside.</P>





<P>4. Mix all the vegetables in one bowl with the salad dressing. Set aside to cool before adding the mayonnaise.</P>





<P>5. Stir in just enough of the mayonnaise to lightly bind the salad together.
Refrigerate. The flavor improves as the salad marinates, so make at least 6 hours in advance.</P>





<P>Any number of vegetables can be used according to your taste. Try some of these: beets, potatoes, leeks, turnips, pearl onions, red pepper, green pepper. The object is to keep the salad colorful.</P>

<P><B>Directions:</B></P>

<P>2. Cut the cake crosswise into three equal sections (you will make cuts so that you end up with three "angel food rings")</P>




<P>3. Spread the first layer generously with raspberry filling.  Set the second later on the first.  Spread this with raspberry too.  Lay the third ring on top and press all three together firmly.</P>




<P>4. Open the frosting and spread over the cake generously.  Cover all surfaces evenly (try to get the inside of the ring too).</P>




<P>5. For service, cut into 1-inch slices with a serrated knife, lay on a plate and serve with a few fresh raspberries.</P>

proceedings. For those of you who are new to the "game scene," the
pre-game fun I am talking about is a tailgate party, so named because
all of the food is generally served out the back end of the car, off the
tailgate of a truck. So grab the hibachi, find that Thermos, locate the
blankets and get
ready for fun.</P>





<P>You don't have to wait for a tailgate
party to use this list of supplies. These items can be easily kept in the
trunk for any
special occasion: a picnic
basket filled with plastic silverware, paper towels (they double as
napkins), plastic glasses, corkscrew, bottle opener, can opener, pocket
knife, paper plates, blanket or table cloth, foil, baggies, wet wipes and
Kleenex. These basics will get the tailgate party going.  Then if you want
to eat, you've got to work a little harder than a stop off for fried
chicken and mashed potatoes. Here are a few ideas.</P>



<UL>
<LI>Put soup in a thermos
<LI>Put cocoa, coffee or tea in a thermos
<LI>Mix canned baked beans with any combination of brown sugar, honey, mustard or ketchup to taste.
<LI>Pack cold cuts, veggies, condiments and bread
<LI>Bring along chili in a heat-proof container
<LI>Chips and dip are great snacks during the game.
<LI>Fresh fruit with yogurt for dipping
</UL>



<P>No matter what you pack though, there are rules to follow to keep
you and the food safe.  There is a temperature danger zone of 40-140
degrees Fahrenheit. Any food between these two temperatures for very long
is in danger of bacterial growth and spoilage. Cooler than 40 degrees or
hotter that 140 degrees is safe to eat. Follow these guidelines for a
healthy and safe tailgate party.</P>





<P>-Any food to be eaten cold should be thoroughly chilled before putting in
the cooler. Once in the cooler, keep cold with ice, blue freezer packs, or
containers of frozen juice.</P>





<P>-Any food to be eaten hot should either be piping hot before storage (if to
be eaten within two hours), or kept completely chilled, like the cold food,
until time to reheat to piping hot.</P>





<P>-Cook all meats until well done to ensure that troublesome organisms have
been killed.</P>





<P>-Store hot and cold foods separately.</P>





<P>-Chill leftovers immediately. Discard large portions of hot food because
it can't chill quick enough in a cooler to be safe for later consumption.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Beef Stew with Dinner Rolls</H2>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Yield</B>:About 6 servings</P>



<B>

<P>1 pound of stew meat</P>





<P>2 cans of mixed vegetables (do not drain)</P>





<P>1 can of stewed tomatoes</P>





<P>1 small onion (sweet) sliced into thick rings</P>





<P>salt</P>





<P>pepper</P>





<P>1 bay leaf</P>

</B>



<P>For the biscuits, you will need a biscuit mix of some kind</P>


<BR>

<P><B>Directions:</B></P>



<P>1. Place all ingredients except for the salt and the pepper into a crockpot
the night before needed. Turn it on low and cook all night for the next
day's lunch. If you want it for dinner instead, put it all together that
morning (before leaving for work) and let it go all day, in the same fashion,
for that
night.</P>





<P>2. It is done when the meat is fork tender and no longer pink.</P>





<P>3. Season with salt and pepper.</P>





<P>4. For the biscuits, follow the directions on the box.  As a yummy
variation, add 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the biscuit mix
before baking.</P>





<P>Serve piping hot with the biscuits!</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Honey Mustard Chicken Nuggets</H2>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B>Ingredients:
<P>2-3 chicken breasts</P>

<P>1 cup crushed saltines crackers
</P>
<P>1/2 teaspoon of rosemary (dried)</P>

<P>1/4 teaspoon of thyme (dried)</P>

<P>1/4 cup yellow mustard</P>

<P>1/4 cup honey (clover works well)</P>

<BR>
<P>Directions:</b>
<P>1. Turn on the broiler in the oven. If there is a temperature control, set
it on about 350
degrees F.</P>

<P>2. Place foil on a sheet pan and spritz with non-stick cooking spray.</P>

<P>3. Mix together the honey and the mustard in a bowl.</P>

<P>4. Cut each of the breasts into fingers about 2 inches long, making sure to
remove any
visible fat.</P>

<P>5. Dip each piece of chicken into the honey mustard and then into the
cracker crumbs
that have the dried herbs mixed in.</P>

<P>6. Place on the sheet pan and put into the oven that has been preheated.</P>

<P>7. Watch the nuggets carefully, but they should be done in about 10-15
minutes. Always
remove the largest nugget and cut it open. If it is done (no longer pink
inside) this a good
indicator that the rest of the nuggets are done as well.</P>

<P>8. Mix up more of the honey mustard sauce for dipping or serve with any of the
following: barbecue sauce, honey, sweet and sour sauce.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Kitchen Basics--Knives</H2>
<BR>
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT>f you are just starting out on your own, chances are you don't have much.  Any little bit of information can be helpful. Unless you are a chef, you probably don't know where to begin when it comes to buying knives.  Knives are essential for cutting, slicing, dicing and chopping. Now, if you plan to live off hot dogs, lunch meat and beer, knives will probably never enter your kitchen--nor will a date--but if you plan to eat well and survive on your own, here are a few tips.</P>





<P>There are many different brands of knives. Some come already boxed ($20-$30) and these are fine. But if you want something a bit more durable--something to last through the years--you will have to spend a bit more money. I'm referring to the knives that are sold individually. Sometimes they are boxed, but most often not. There are usually about a million to choose from, but these are the ones you will need to survive.</P>





<P>The first is the chef knife. This knife generally comes in 10" and 8".  Which size you choose is completely up to you--whatever feels most comfortable. Both knives serve the same purpose. The chef knife is good for slicing vegetables, cutting large portions of raw meat, chopping and dicing. It's one of the most important knives.</P>





<P>The next is the utility. This knife does most things the chef knife does, but is slightly smaller--usually 6" to 8". It's good for pantry work, such as preparing lettuce, fruits and so on. It's also good for carving poultry.</P>





<P>The paring knife--usually about 2" to 3"--is probably the most widely used knife in the home kitchen. It is small, versatile and can be more easily manipulated and maneuvered than the other two. Used mostly for trimming and paring fruits and vegetables, it can also be used as a baking tool for trimming pie doughs and cutting pasta. People find this to be most useful for smaller jobs (cutting strawberries, slicing celery, paring apples).  Because it is so small, it fits comfortably in your hand.</P>

  



<P>Don't let the salespeople talk you into a 17 piece set so they can get their comission. Buy what you want and need. You have to live with what you purchase, not the salesperson.  Keep your mind set and dive right in.</P>





<P>Things to remember when buying knives:</P>




<UL>
<LI>How much can you afford?
<LI>How will you use the knives?
<LI>Spend a little extra for quality--it's better in the long run.
<LI>How long do you want these knives to last?
</UL>



<P>Some of the most popular brands are Chicago Cutlery, Henckles, and Wustoff, although there are many other brands.</P>





<P>Prices range from $10 per knife to over $400 for top of the line. Just remember--whatever feels right. Hold the knife in your hand. If it doesn't feel right, don't buy it. Be sharp and don't get cut. Have fun!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Berry Wonderful Salad</H2>
<BR><BR>





<P><FONT SIZE=4>A</FONT>lthough it is not as common to see fresh fruit as an end to a French meal, it will pop up occasionally, especially when the weather is hot and something light is in order. This also makes a wonderful snack.</P>








<P><B>1 pint of good raspberries</B></P>





<P><B>1 pint of blueberries</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 pound of cherries-halved (Bing cherries are wonderful)</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 pound of strawberries-sliced thin</B></P>





<P><B>Honey</B></P>





<P><B>Heavy whipping cream</B></P>


<BR>
<BR>



<P><B>Directions:</B></P>





<P>1. Make sure that all of the fruit is clean before starting. Carefully wash the berries in cold water and pat dry with a clean towel.</P>





<P>2. Leave the raspberries and the blueberries whole. Remove the seeds from the cherries and then cut each in half. Remove the tops of the strawberries (be careful not to remove too much of the berry) and then slice them thin.</P>





<P>3.  Put all of the berries into a bowl and gently mix together.</P>

  



<P>4. If the berries are a bit tart, sprinkle with a bit of sugar and mix again. Be careful not to use too much sugar. You want to be able to taste the berry, not the sugar.</P>





<P>5. Pour about 1 cup of the whipping cream into a mixing bowl and begin to mix on low speed of an electric mixer (a wire whisk can be used, but beware that it is hard on the arm muscles). When it JUST starts to thicken a bit, add about one tablespoon of honey and continues to beat. You do not want the cream to get chunky, just smooth so that when you pull the beaters out of the mixture, it gently sticks to the beaters. Even if it is a bit runny, that's okay. Now taste it to make sure that it's sweet enough. If not, add a bit more honey and mix just long enough to incorporate. Cover and refrigerate.</P>





<P>If you're not ambitious enough to make your own whipped cream, either buy some or simply serve the berries sprinkled in honey. </P>

 



<P>To serve, put a small portion of berries into a dessert dish and carefully place whipped cream on top. Garnish with fresh mint if desired.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Black Peppercorn Steak</H2>				

<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT> have returned from France and have some wonderful things for you. 
I've modified some French recipes to fit your lifestyle. Using healthier cooking methods and altering the ingredients a bit, I have brought to you French Cuisine ... almost.</P>








<P><B>3 tablespoons of black peppercorns (or combine black, pink and white)</B></P>





<P><B>4 or 5 steaks of choice, cut to about 3/4 of an inch</B></P>





<P><B>Non-stick cooking spray (butter flavored if possible)</B></P>





<P><B>Salt</B></P>




<P><B>1/2 cup of alcohol (brandy, cognac, wine)</B></P>





<P><B>1/2 to 1 cup of heavy whipping cream</B></P>





<P><B>1 onion</B></P>

<BR>
<BR>




<P><B>Directions:</B></P>





<P>1. Using a hammer or the back side of a pan, crush the peppercorns. Do this just before use to preserve the flavor.</P>





<P>2. Divide the peppercorns evenly between the steaks and press firmly into the flesh. The steaks may be refrigerated overnight this way to infuse flavor.</P>





<P>3. Spray the pan generously with the cooking spray.</P>





<P>4. Add the steaks and onion to the pan and saut&eacute until brown on the first side.  Flip the steak over and repeat. Season with salt and continue to cook until done as desired.</P>





<P>5. Remove steaks and onion rings from the pan and carefully pour off the juices and discard. Place the steaks and onions back in the pan.</P>





<P>6. Return the pan to the burner and add the alcohol and flambe, if desired.*</P>

 



<P>7. Add the cream to the pan and simmer for about five minutes, stirring occasionally.  If the onions are not yet done, remove the steaks from the pan and continue to cook.</P>






<P><B>Serving suggestions:</B></P>





<P>Candied yams, baked potato, caramelized onions, salad</P>





<P>*Flambe means to light the alcohol. This will leave the flavor of the liquid, but remove the alcohol from it. Read up or ask a pro before trying this.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>-P</FONT>ut a quarter of a vanilla bean into the bottom of a ten-cup coffee pot
before the coffee is brewed. The bean will steep in the coffee and
take on a wonderful flavor. Try serving with whipped cream and vanilla
sugar.*</P>




<P>- Place a cinnamon stick in the bottom of a ten-cup coffee pot. Follow the
directions above.</P>




<P>- Fill a coffee mug half full with coffee and then add one tablespoon of
chocolate syrup. Top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cocoa.</P>




<P>- Use vanilla sugar or honey to sweeten your coffee.</P>




<P>- Present your guests first with their own cups of coffee, and then place a
saucer of hard candies on the table that they can drop into their coffee to
sweeten and flavor it. Good flavors to try are butterscotch, cinnamon,
peppermint, caramel, anise, vanilla, amaretto (Brachs makes a line of
International Toffees that would be excellent for this purpose).</P>





<P>For those who don't like coffee, the same ideas can be applied to hot
chocolate. This idea goes over well with youngsters.</P>





<P>*Vanilla sugar is made by burying a piece of vanilla bean in a cup or two
of sugar.  Seal both in a jar and allow to sit for a few days. Shake every
now and then to disperse the flavor.  Taste it to determine the intensity
of the vanilla flavor and use as desired.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Healthy Eating--French Style</H2>
<BR>
<BR>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>W</FONT>hether you are trying your hand at classical French fare or are simply trying to keep the hot side hot and the cold side cold, here are a few ways to lighten your food and get you on the road to healthier eating and a happier life.</P>





<P>1. Try using non-stick pans to reduce the amount of oil or fat needed to cook with.</P>





<P>2. Saut&eacute; vegetables in water or a spritz of cooking spray instead of oil or butter. Season with herbs and spices.</P>





<P>3. Use lower-fat or no-fat ingredients when possible.</P>





<P>4. Ste am your vegetables whenever possible--this not only keeps them crisper, but they retain a lot more nutrients this way.</P>





<P>5. One cup of beans adds flavor and fiber, not to mention protein, to soups, stews and salads.</P>





<P>6. When a recipe calls for salt, either reduce the amount by half, or omit it all together and season with herbs. This lowers sodium in the diet.</P>





<P>7. If a recipe calls for whole eggs, try replacing 2 egg whites for every 1 whole egg. This lowers fat in the recipe (1 yolk has about 4 grams of fat) and cholesterol. </P>





<P>8. After cooking ground beef, place it in a strainer and rinse it with hot water to remove excess fat and grease.</P>





<P>9. When a recipe calls for butter, reduce the amount by a third and see what the result. You may be surprised. (This does not always work in baked products)</P>





<P>10. Substitute lean ground turkey or chicken for regular ground beef when possible.</P>





<P>There are many other ways to make a healthier you, but this will hopefully head you in the right direction.  Good Luck.</P>

Honey Glazed Carrots, Seasoned Rice,
 and dessert  <I>(perhaps a <A HREF="des1.html">Baked Apple</A>)</I>
</P></H3></B>

<P>Have you ever wanted to be romantic on short notice, and all that's in the refrigerator is beer, salsa, and chicken salad?  It's difficult, when you live alone, to be frugal with your money, but at the same time be elegant.  I have devised a menu that provides romance with easy steps, a small amount of time, and little money.  Get ready for a menu that will enhance a romantic evening!</P>



<BR>







<B>

<P>8-10 oz. of beef sirloin tips (you will probably have to buy beef sirloin 	and have the butcher cut it into pieces for you)</P>




<P>Burgundy wine or other dry red wine</P>




<P>1 red pepper</P>




<P>1 green pepper</P>




<P>1 small onion (I suggest vidalia or a white onion)</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of butter</P>




<P>1 small package of baby carrots</P>




<P>1 tablespoon of honey
White rice (enough for two people)
1 beef boullion cube</P>



<BR>
<BR>



<P>Directions</P></B>




<P>1. Cut the peppers into thin strips and discard the seeds.  Then cut the onion into thin rings.  Place enough of each for two people into a skillet with the butter.  Saute' until the veggies are hot and partially cooked, but still a bit crisp (about five minutes).  Set aside.</P>




<P>2. Heat a skillet or wok on high heat and add the beef tips.  Cook briefly on all sides to brown (this seals in the juices).  Turn the heat to medium, then add 1/4 -1/2 cup of the burgundy wine and continue to cook until the beef is no longer pink in the center.</P>




<P>3. While the beef is cooking, follow the directions for the rice and get that started.  Add the boullion to the water according to the instructions.  This will flavor the rice quite nicely.  </P>






<P>4. Go back to the beef tips while the rice is doing its thing.  Add the sauteed veggies to the tips, season to taste with salt and pepper, and turn the heat to low.</P>





<P>5. Check the rice before you move to the carrots.</P>






<P>6. The fastest and easiest way to cook these carrots is going to be in the microwave.  Put the carrots, about a teaspoon of water, and a dash of salt into a microwave safe container.  Cover with plastic wrap, place in the microwave, and cook on high for about three minutes.  After this time, poke them with a fork to test them.  They are done whenever they are as tender as you like.  Drain off the water, and add the honey.  Place the plastic wrap back over the bowl and place back inside the microwave (do not turn it on...this just provides a place to keep the carrots warm).</P>




<P>7. Check the rice.  Check the beef tips.  If everything is hot and done, you are ready to plate it up and eat it.  **If the sauce with the beef tips seems too runny, take about 1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon of cornstarch, mix it with a bit of cold water (to form a paste), and stir it into the beef tip mix.  This will thicken the sauce.  Continue to cook just a few minutes longer, and then serve.</P>



<P>Bon Appetit!</P></B>

<BR>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><i>ALL U CAN EAT</b></i> by Lela Nargi (Princeton Review Series $15.00 USA,
$21.00 Canada)</H2>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>his is a wonderful book on the very basics of cooking. It could easily be
called <i>How
To Boil Water</i>,  because it does just that. Nargi tells it like it is.
From boiling water
to entertaining others, this is a simple, easy-to-follow book for those who
want to cook--
and cook well--but don't have a clue.</P>

<P>The book starts out discussing kitchen products such as baking sheets,
roasting pans,
stockpots, woks, etc. And Nargi explains exactly what they're for, the sizes
they come in
and if they're really necessary for the kitchen cook. The next section,
<i>Things With
Handles</i>,  is all about utensils such as the apple corer, the chef's
knife, garlic press,
potato masher, etc. Then the book moves to colanders, mixers and other
useful, but not-
always-necessary things.</P>

<P>Nargi's next stop is at the grocery store where she describes products found
there and
their uses at home, including how to store them before and after use. If
you've made it
this far and you're not frightened out of the kitchen, she helps us to boil
water, make
toast, chop an onion, cook potatoes and more. The basics first, then more as
we learn.</P>

<P>The book is easy to navigate. Whether it's about breakfast (where we learn
how to make
coffee and French toast) or vegetarian dishes (like stir-fry meals and
stuffed artichokes),
all of the recipes are very simple, straight forward, easy to follow and
make. The
ingredients are readily found in the grocery store. Simple and yummy.</P>

<P>Another great feature is the information given for each recipe. Servings,
difficulty level,
and time to prepare are presented for everything. There also are variations
given on some
of the recipes so that if you feel daring, you can dive in and explore the
world of cooking
even further. Along the sides of some pages are informative quips and ideas.
Some
pertain to the history of food, some are musical selections that relate to
the culinary field,
others are definitions and tidbits that are amusing and informative.</P>

<P>The only thing that bothers me is the lack of pictures. I like pictures so
that I can tell
exactly what it is I'm making and if what I've produced looks like it's
supposed to. There
aren't many in this book and those that are present are hand drawn.  The
lack of photos is
not bad, not at all. It's just my personal opinion. <i>All U Can Eat</i>,
overall, is
excellent for the first-time cook or long-time cook who needs a refresher
course.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Your First Kitchen</H2>
<BR>
<BR>



<BLOCKQUOTE><P>As graduation approaches, we are all faced with the big questions.  How do I survive on my own?  What do I do?  What do I need?  Do I have what it takes to keep my underwear from turning pink in the washer?   Despite how huge the real world seems, it is possible to pull it into perspective.  Assuming your mother has helped you along until now, here is just a little more motherly advice to get you going. </P>

 



<P>The new apartment tenant must have a few things to survive in the kitchen.  Some people need more than others, but even if all you do is eat hot dogs and frozen dinners, I think the following will still apply.</P>





<P>The Absolutely Must-Have Kitchen Stuff</P>





<UL>
<LI> A small microwave (great for those frozen dinners and leftovers)
<LI>A paring knife and a chef knife (see the article in the May issue of ENTER)
<LI>Simple dishes (plates and bowls are a must; saucers and gravy boats are not)
<LI>Silverware (go for about 4 sets of knife, fork, spoon if you live alone)
<LI>Glasses (pickle and jelly jars work well here)
<LI> Basic spices (salt, pepper, cinnamon, etc.)
<LI> A sponge and dish soap (Do NOT use regular dish soap in dishwasher.  Use dishwasher soap, otherwise, you will be cleaning up suds for a long time.)
<LI> Plastic storage containers for leftovers (try Cool Whip containers and butter tubs)
<LI>One skillet and one saucepan (try to get a non-stick skillet)
<LI> A small four cup coffeepot (these also can make tea)
<LI> Dish towels and pot holders
<LI> Spoons and spatulas
</UL>




<P>As you get into your kitchen, you will probably want more than just these items, but these are the essentials.  Just think: if cavemen survived with sticks and rocks, you can survive with these simple basics.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, halved</B></P>




<P><B>1/4 cup yellow mustard</B></P>




<P><B>1/4 cup honey</B></P>

<BR>
<BR>


<FONT SIZE=4>

<P><B>Ingredients for zucchini</B></P>

</FONT>


<P><B>1 small zucchini or yellow squash</B></P>




<P><B>1 tablespoon butter
salt</B></P>




<P><B>pepper</B></P>


<BR>
<BR>



<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>Ingredients for potatoes</FONT></B></P>




<P><B>8 new potatoes, skins on</B></P>




<P><B>1 tablespoon butter</B></P>




<P><B>garlic salt</B></P>




<P><B>pepper</B></P>

<BR>
<BR>



<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>Directions:</FONT></B></P>



<P>Before doing anything else, fire up the grill (either gas or charcoal). </P>





<P>1. Remove any visible fat from the chicken breasts. Separate each breast
in half. This will give you four smaller pieces. Set aside for the
moment.</P>





<P>2. Combine the honey and the mustard. Generously baste the chicken with
the mixture and set aside again. This step may be done the night before in
order to let the chicken marinate in the sauce, but make sure to put it in
the refrigerator for the night.</P>





<P>3. Once the grill is hot enough, put the chicken on and cover the grill.
Keep a close eye on the chicken...you want to cook it, not burn it.</P>





<P>4. Fill a pot with enough water to generously cover the potatoes when they
are in it. Put the pot on the burner and leave to boil. When the water
boils, turn the heat down to simmer and cook the potatoes until they are
tender when poked with a fork. Drain and set aside to cool for the moment.</P>





<P>5. While the potatoes are cooking, look in on the chicken and flip it over.
You may want to baste it again with the honey and mustard, but make up a
new batch. The first batch may have bacteria in it from the raw chicken,
so make sure to also clean the basting brush. Cover again.</P>





<P>6. While the potatoes are boiling, slice the zucchini very thin and place
into a skillet with the butter, salt, and pepper. Cook on medium heat
until the zucchini are tender, but not soggy.  Remove from the heat.</P>





<P>7. Once the potatoes are cool enough to touch, cut each into fourths and
put into a bowl. Toss in 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt and the butter
indicated. Set aside.</P>





<P>8. By now the chicken should be done (the juices should run clear when cut).
 Remove
from the grill. Now everything is ready to serve. If the
zucchini is cool, place on the burner long enough to heat, and if the
potatoes are cool, put in the microwave long enough to warm. Serve
according to your appetite.</P>

Still, the number of bikes stolen annually continues to rise. The FBI reported 500,000 thefts took place in 1994, and some independent firms say nearly double that figure is probably closer to the truth. Why such a rise? Simple Economics 101: supply and demand. Campuses provide both, making it easy to get and sell bikes without creating too many waves. The former thief explains: "I sold to mostly college-aged kids, because they  didn't question where (the bikes) came from."</P>





<P>When asked about potential dangers, he says, "when I was really trying to be careful, I'd go to another area, like a campus a couple of hours away, and grab some bikes to sell here (Chicago), or I'd take a few from here to friends I have in the suburbs or on campuses. That is why I went for the plain bikes...they are less likely to be recognized."</P>





<P>Locking your bike securely will require some extra time on your part, but the time you spend will amount to less than the time you'll spend at the police station and wrestling with your insurance company. This former thief quit a while ago when his conscience began to nag him, but he cautions, "Every day there is someone out there that will take a bike if he sees an easy enough target." </P>

         



<P>Even the best locks won't help if you leave your bike out for long periods of time. If you're giving the thieves the time to plan, you may as well gift wrap your bike for them. Don't leave your bike locked outdoors during breaks or weekends, and don't leave it in unlit areas with light traffic.</P>





<P>Registering your bike with either your campus or some independent registry company can help you retrieve your bike if it is recovered. Both of these will cost some money, but they will eliminate the hassle of trying to prove ownership if your bike is found. Many bikes rust in campus and police warehouses. If you can't prove ownership, you may as well start shopping for a new steed.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>C</FONT>ollege can be pretty expensive.The last thing you need is to replace a stolen bicycle. If you're not careful, you could become one of a growing number of college students who fall victim to bike theft.
</P>




<P>According to FBI reports, larceny/theft is the largest category of crime. While most categories of theft were going down, though, bicycle theft rose 10 percent and cost an estimated $126 million dollars. In the face of such odds, the best defense seems to be a good offense--or at least some common sense.</P>





<P>Reading this won't guarantee your bike will still be in front of the quad tomorrow, but if you follow these guidelines and take some precautions, it may just help you save that bus fare for laundry.</P>





<P>First, don't be fooled into thinking that the  "lead-sled" your parents bought you for your 16th birthday isn't worth locking or that no one would bother taking it. If you would rather use it than walk to get across town or campus, chances are someone else would, too. Buy a lock and lock it properly, or you may be stuck on the shoe-leather express.</P>





<P>The type of lock you select will play a major role in determining the success or failure of a potential thief. The four-digit barrel locks you used when you were 10 may keep 10- year-olds from ripping you off, but these locks will not deter even a novice thief. "Those locks take seconds to get through. I <IMG WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=251 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="Bike.gif">never see any bike worth anything locked with  one," says a former bike thief from Chicago who asked not to be identified. Unless your bike is worth less than $25 (the cost of most "entry-level" U-Locks), it's best to stay  away from barrel locks.</P>





<P>U-Locks are your first line of defense. These locks are made of hardened steel and provide a solid connection between your bike and whatever it's locked to. Many of these locks include an insurance policy to cover your investment, but be sure to read the fine print and follow the necessary requirements to qualify. Also, some of the less-expensive U-Locks are easier to break because of plastic locking mechanisms.</P>





<P>Regardless of your choice, you may want to add reinforcement bars to the lock for added security. These bars add strength and prevent the insertion of a pipe or other object that may allow enough leverage to snap the lock. Adding these will make potential thieves take you a little more seriously. "If (the bikes) are locked real well and are in an area that would make it hard to snag without drawing a lot of attention, then I'd pass it by," says the former thief.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>French Onion Soup, Bread Crisps and Caesar Salad</H2>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B>Ingredients:</P>
<BR>
<P>Soup:</b></P>
<P>1 qt of beef stock or the equivalent using bullion cubes</P>

<P>1 large yellow onion</P>

<P>1 tablespoon of butter</P>

<P>2 thick slices of swiss cheese</P>

<P>salt and pepper</P>
<BR>
<P><b>Bread Crisps:</b></P>
<P>1 small loaf of french bread</P>

<P>butter</P>

<P>garlic salt</P>
<BR>
<P><b>Caesar Salad:</b></P>
<P>3 cups of romaine lettuce cut into bite size pieces</P>

<P>3 tablespoons of parmesan cheese</P>

<P>store bought croutons (or make some out of the French bread)</P>

<P>store-bought caesar dressing (regular, low-fat or no-fat)</P>

<BR>
<P><B>Directions:</b>
<P>1. For the soup, cut the onions in half so that you can then cut each half
into rings. Cut
the rings about 1/4 inch thick. When this is done, then cut the rings in
half so that each
one represents a moon shape. Put these in a 2-quart pot with the butter over
medium high
heat. Cook until the onions are a beautiful golden brown.</P>

<P>2. Add the stock to the onions and cook until the stock is nice and hot (not
boiling). Turn
the heat to low and move to the salad.</P>

<P>3. Place the bite size pieces of romaine into a large mixing bowl. Add about
1/4 cup of
dressing to start with and also the parmesan cheese a handful of croutons.
Toss all of this
together, and if it seems a bit dry, add some more dressing, but not too
much. Place the
bowl in the refrigerator.</P>

<P>4. Cut the french bread at a 45-degree angle to get nice pieces of bread.
Each slice should
be about 1/2 inch thick. You need 6 of these. Wrap the leftover bread in
plastic wrap and
put in the freezer for another time.</P>

<P>5. Brush each piece with melted butter and lightly sprinkle each with the
garlic salt.</P>

<P>6. Place on a sheet pan in a 300 degree F oven for about 10 minutes to dry
out and then
under the broiler to crisp and brown. Watch carefully under the
broiler--they will brown
<i>very</i>  fast.</P>

<P>7.  Put about a cup of soup in each bowl and put a slice of cheese on top of
each. Try to
get the cheese to overlap the edges of the bowl so that it doesn't sink.</P>

<P>8. Put the bowls in the oven under the broiler until the cheese melts and
turns golden. You are ready for service.</P>

<P>9. Remove the bowls from the oven with hot pads and put on one side of a
dinner plate.
Place 3 of the bread crisps on the plate alongside the soup. Use salad bowls
or salad
plates for the salad. Top with croutons and enjoy.
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>C</FONT>andy canes are a holiday tradition. The problem is, what do you do with
them after the
tree comes down? Some families eat 'em up, but many don't and they simply
get thrown
out or sit around until next year and get gummy. Here are a few ways to
utilize those
peppermint decorations after the presents are opened.</P>

<P>1. Dip the long end in chocolate and then into sprinkles and let the kids go
nuts for them.</P>

<P>2. Use them as stirrers for coffee, tea or hot chocolate.</P>

<P>3. Crush them up and sprinkle them on ice cream.</P>

<P>4. Before baking, sprinkle crushed candy on sugar cookies.  Bake and cool
and there is
not need for icing.</P>

<P>5. Stir crushed candy cane into brownie or cake batter before baking (about
2 or 3 canes).</P>

<P>6. Dip pre-made cookies into chocolate and then into crushed peppermint. Put
into the
refrigerator to set.</P>

<P>7. Toss the crushed candy into cookie dough with chocolate chips for a wonderful
variation.</P>

<P>8. Use the smaller candy canes as decorations of desserts.</P>

<P>9. Offer the smaller candy canes as after dinner mints to guests.</P>

<P>10. Try the recipe in the December issue of ENTER (<A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/dec/food/bark.html">Peppermint Bark</A>).

<IMG WIDTH=54 HEIGHT=74 ALT="E"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="gamecap.gif">ver wish you could get back all those quarters you dropped down those flashing, bottomless pits at the arcade as a kid. Did you spend hours in front of your Atari 2600 racing Pitfall Harry across the jungle? Do you remember ColecoVision, or did you have a Commodore 64? How would you like to relive all of those great childhood memories... and get paid for it? Yes friends, somewhere out there, people are playing video games, and they're making money doing it. Think you have what it takes to be a video game reviewer, or tester? Read on.

<P>Christian Svensson reviews games for <I>Next Generation Magazine</I>. He knows what qualifications make a good reviewer. "The ideal candidate will have a working knowledge of C and Assembly languages, as well as good writing skills, but you gotta die for games." He said. Svensson said that while it's not a requirement, he looks for someone with extensive technical knowledge, who understands what makes a game good, and can say why a game is good. Not someone who just says "this game rocks."</P>

<P>He also looks for someone who can play a game, make comparisons, and then articulate the finer points in a review. "Someone with good writing skills with a degree in English or journalism."</P>

<P>Sure reviewing  games is a lot of fun, "you get to see things before everyone else" according to Svensson. But all of this fun has its drawbacks. When the crappy game comes along, and Svensson says they do, you still have to run it through its test cycle.</P>

<P>This cycle can be pretty time consuming. While your typical shoot 'em up or racing game may take only ten hours to get a good enough feel for it, reviewing an adventure or RPG (role playing game) may go on for days according to Svensson.</P>

<P>And then it's time to give the game a review. Svensson said they use a "mathematical formula" to get the actual rating for a game. He explains that genre plays an important role when determining what review a game deserves. With a racing game, or the average Joe Sportstar endorsed sport challenge, "a reviewer should take note of such things as control and  frame rate. With  an RPG, the plot, effects, and story play a greater role" said Svensson.</P>

<P>If your interested in getting your hands on the games <I>before</I> they make it out the door for review, you may want to try you hand at testing.</P>

<HEAD><TITLE>Enter Magazine--Pulling It Off: Tattoo Removal</TITLE></HEAD>  
<BODY BACKGROUND="newback.gif" LINK="#000033" VLINK="#000000"> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><IMG SRC="scar.gif"></P>
<BR>


<P>The first step in a removal procedure is a consultation to find out the background of the tattoo. Was the tattoo done by an amateur or a professional? How old is the tattoo? Was this tattoo covered? What kind of ink was used? The procedure can begin once the tattoo's background is established.</P>

<P>The second step is to apply a local topical anesthesia called EMLA cream. It takes two hours after the application before the area is ready for the laser surgery.</P>

<P>The laser uses extremely fast, high pulses of energy on the ink of a tattoo, breaking it down and allowing it to be absorbed and digested by the body. There are three different kinds of lasers utilized in a tattoo removal: ND Yag works best on blue, black and dark green ink, a ruby laser works best on bright and lighter colors, and an Alexandrite uses a synthetically created ruby to work on bright greens and some other colors. The ND Yag is also a laser that works on the invisible infrared spectrum and works more efficiently because the melanin of the skin cannot absorb the laser's energy. The lasers work at approximately 10 shots per second at a three mm spot. A four inch-by-four inch laser tattoo removal treatment takes about five minutes.</P>

<P>The amount of laser treatments before a tattoo is completely removed varies on its age, color and how it was created. An amateur tattoo can be removed in one to three treatments. A professional tattoo that uses a lot of darkened space can take up to as many as eight treatments. The amount of ink and type of inks used in the tattooing process greatly affect the difficulty of removal. Tattoo inks are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, so there are many variations and some even contain plastics, ashes and coals in their make-up. Inks like these can be difficult to remove.</P>

<P>After the laser procedure, the area is treated with Bactracin, a triple biotic ointment, and hydrogen peroxide for two or three days until swelling and crusting is done. It is also recommended that people use sunscreen on any exposed area to prevent hyperpigmentation (too-dark skin) on the removal area. Usually any hyperpigmentation that occurs resolves itself over time. It also takes two to three months for the ink to fade and be maximally digested by the body. While there is a chance of scarring and mild textural change, Dr. Kunz has not seen any in his practice.</P>

<P>Choosing whether to get a real cool cobra or have your ex-girlfriend's name lasered away is a big decision. Think long and hard before becoming a work of art. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>C</FONT>huck Bonini, of Activision has been testing for two and a half years. He said there is no formal training involved in becoming a tester but, "It helps to be an avid gamer. If you love to play games and have some knowledge of PC's, Macintosh computers as well as console platforms, then you can test games." Bonini added, "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to do this job, but it does take tenacity.  We play a game, the same game over and over and over."</P>

<P>If that didn't send you running, then keep in mind that testers are always racing against time. "The worst part of the job is working to meet the deadlines for code release," said Bonini. "During the last phase of the testing period we go through 'crunch time.'  At this point, timing becomes crucial.  New code arrives each day, sometimes more than once a day.  We must test the code and report back to the production team in the shortest time frame possible, meaning long days and nights." He added. </P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=206 SRC="gamequote.gif"></P>
<BR>

<P>The deadlines vary from project to project. "Some games are huge and require extensive testing from a large team which can take five months or more.  Sometimes we have a small team of two to three testers working on a smaller projects which may only take one or two weeks," said Bonini.</P>

<P>The tests themselves are dependent on the phase the project is in according to Bonini. In the beginning, the goal may be to make the game more intuitive. Later consideration is paid to minimal system requirements, CPU speeds, and hardware compatibility.</P>

<P>Despite the challenging deadlines, and long hours, Bonini feels his job has its rewards. "The best parts of my job is being exposed to the many styles of 
computer games." He said. "What's exciting about being in this business today is the advancing technology of networking games, giving players endless worlds and battles to explore." He added.</P>

<P>Does this sound like your dream job? You may be in luck. Bonini said Activision sometimes uses outside testers. "We use 'outside Beta testers' who are gamers we have recruited or who have found us over the Internet. When a product is almost ready for code release to the public, we submit a copy to these 'outside Beta testers' who then play the game and provide feedback...This enables us to more thoroughly test a larger game in a shorter period of time and meet our deadline."</P>

<P>So do you think you have what it takes to review or test? Just in case, you'd better grab a handful of quarters from that jar in your parents' bedroom and head to your local arcade, or blow the dust off of that old Atari you have in the basement. Just be sure to say "hi" to Pitfall Harry for me.</P>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>here was a time when a person could expect to take a job after college, work for 30 years and retire with a gold watch. Few employees spend their entire career with one company these days, and a person is lucky to get a handshake upon retirement, let alone a snazzy Seiko. In fact, for a growing percentage of America's labor force, temporary employment has become a necessary fact of life, not an option.</P>





<P>Despite statistics that would suggest the nation's economy is healthy and getting healthier, a number of companies turn to temps rather than hire permanent full-time personnel. Where two or three national temp agencies may have been enough to plug the country's clerical job holes 20 years ago, there may be as many as 60 or more agencies listed in some metro telephone books today. ENTER interviewed managers at nearly 20 temporary agencies about the industry's growth, the current job market and landing permanent employment. The agencies included large national companies and small regional or local agencies. While clerical workers remain the backbone of the temp industry, many of the agencies offer highly specialized workers in an unlimited number of fields, including construction, landscaping, medical services and computer programming.</P>




<IMG WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=194 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="go.gif">


<P>Kelly Temporary Services began as an agency noted for its reliable pool of secretaries, receptionists and other clerical personnel. Now in its 50th year, Kelly also offers workers in marketing, technical and light industrial areas, says supervisor Erica Doud, and gone is the temp image that inspired the company's trademark "Kelly Girl."</P>






<P>"It's not just girls today," Doud says.</P>





<P>Doud says "temp services are the thing right now. That's why there are so many around."</P>





<P>Like most temporary agencies, Kelly doesn't charge fees to applicants. Employers pay a per-person, per-hour fee; Kelly handles tax withholding and distributes the paycheck to the worker. And insurance benefits are available to workers at some of the larger agencies.</P>

<P>Manpower Temporary Services, the largest of the temp agencies with more than a thousand offices around the world, is responsible for all the typical personnel paperwork, according to branch manager Teresa Ford. "While a temporary is with a company, they're our burden," Ford says.</P>

<P>Every temp agency claims to be a convenience to companies and workers alike. Workers get a foot in the door, earn a paycheck and get an opportunity to prove themselves to people who can give them full-time jobs. Meanwhile, companies get to test drive workers before they make a commitment to hire. One agency customer service representative repeatedly used the phrase "temp to hire."</P>





<P>"It allows a company to try out a person," Doud says.</P>

<P>It's not unrealistic to go into a temp job hoping to go full time, according to Ford. "I was a temporary."
</P>





<P>Ford quotes statistics that suggest 38 percent of temp workers become permanent. "Companies look to temporary services to screen employees, and they will only keep the cream of the crop."</P>





<P>Manpower, like Kelly, began as a strictly clerical placement agency but has since added industrial and technical workers, Ford says. "I couldn't quote you bill rates (to companies)," she says, "but we're going to charge more for a person with greater skills."</P>





<P>Workers with greater skills can expect fatter paychecks. They won't get rich in the temp game, but someone with computer experience or software knowledge might find the money isn't awful. "Technical workers make good money," Ford says.</P>





<P>The explosion in the temporary field is a reflection of the current job market, according to some agencies. Herb Gilmore, business manager of the regional Alternative Work Services, a four-year-old general labor agency, says a person need look no further than the trend in downsizing to see why temporaries have become so valuable to companies.</P>





<P>Temporary agencies aren't "the only way to go," says Gilmore, "(but) it's a shrinking job market. Everything's gotten smaller. Companies will use temporaries to fill their up times."</P>





<P>One bit of advice remains true whether the person is seeking temp work or full-time employment. "Feel the market out and do some networking," Ford says.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Welcome to my life tattoo <BR>
We will have a long time together <BR>
I expect I'll regret you but the skin graft will never get you <BR>
You'll be there when I die tattoo</I>
<BR><BR>
From "Tattoo" by Pete Townsend
<BR><BR>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>F</FONT>ads change quickly. Style is personal and rarely permanent. Lately, with the advent of grunge, alternative trash fashions and anti-style, the tattoo has grown in popularity. But unlike parachute pants, bell bottoms and Mohawk haircuts, the tattoo has very permanent implications.</P>

<P>For many, tattoos are works of art, an extreme statement of individuality. Once associated with bikers, convicts and sailors, tattoos have become a hip fashion accessory for many famous actors and musicians. A tattoo, however, is not an Italian-cut shirt or a double-breasted suit that can be changed on a whim. So what happens if you change your mind after ink meets flesh?</P>

<P>The simplest way to have a tattoo removed is to not get one in the first place. Getting a tattoo is a serious decision and shouldn't be taken lightly.</P>

<P>If your tattoo has gotten under your skin and you've decided you want "Mother" or "Born to Die" removed, laser surgery is the answer.</P>

<P>The current laser procedure for tattoo removal was first developed and marketed in 1993. Laser tattoo removal is done both by plastic surgeons and dermatologists and is becoming quite an ordinary and common procedure. According to Dr. Peter Kunz, most people get their tattoos between the ages of 14 and 21. Most of his patients range from their late 20s to 40s.</P>

<P>The procedure isn't cheap. It costs about $300 for a treatment for a four inch-by-four inch area. Why so expensive? The lasers used in the operation cost from $80,000 to $100,000 each. </P>

<P>Kunz, an Indianapolis-based plastic surgeon who specializes in laser surgery, described a typical removal procedure for <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com">ENTER</A>.</P>

Are you a people person? Like kids? Want a job that lets you sit most of the time? Well, ENTER may have just found you the job of your dreams. Be warned, though; the job's very temporary.</P>

<P>We've all seen them and have probably even confided in--or begged--them once or twice. But how does one become a mall Santa Claus?</P>

<P>According to Julie Inkrott, who works in marketing at one midwestern mall, ads are placed in local papers, and then prospective applicants are screened to make sure they're qualified. This helps to eliminate the stereotypical Santas often portrayed in movies (they're the guys clutching five-year-olds and making slurred ho-ho-hos through wine- and nicotine-stained beards).</P>

<P>What about the physical characteristics? "We definitely like it when someone looks like Santa," says Inkrott. She added that applicants with full white beards have an edge. If you don't have what it takes now, don't worry. You have about a year to work on the whiskers.</P>

<P>At Inkrott's mall, they employ both full- and part-time help that lasts from late November to December 24. Many of the employees are retired gentlemen who just want to bring some wholesome excitement to young visitors.</P>

<P>If you're ready, start training now. Here's the fool-proof "You Too Can Be Kris Kringle" plan: Quit shaving, eat lots of fried foods, and watch as many bowl games as you can handle. Then switch to MTV or ESPN and let your lardy butt slowly mold into the Lazy Boy you're lounging in. Maybe bounce a few neices or nephews on your knee from time to time, and work on those important listening skills. Then next November, keep your eyes peeled for the right ads--"JFM (Jolly Fat Male) for temporary position. Strong lap and lots of facial hair a plus."</P>

<P><b>Dear Coach:</P>
I've heard that it's not what you know, it's who you know.  I feel like I
don't know
anyone!  I hate the thought of  "networking"--I've never liked the thought
of  selling
myself. Is there an easier way to build my network other than through
networking?  
<i>Newark</i></b></P>


<P>Dear Newark:</P>
I've asked myself those same questions and spent endless hours trying to
figure out
another way to advance my career without networking. Recently, a prominent
headhunter
in New York told me some good news: "Networking is dead," he said. He wasn't
trying
to be dramatic, but networking as we've known it <i>is</i>  dead. People
today don't
network just to add another name to their Rolodex. People network today as
if they are
building something. One contact could lead to many contacts that could lead
you to that
person with whom you always wanted to work. The bad news is you still need
to connect
with people, and you need as many contacts as possible to build your career.
About 70
percent of jobs are found through people you know.  </P>

<P>Follow these tips and watch your world shift from hating to schmooze to
welcoming the
opportunity.</P>

<P>1. <b>Redefine networking for yourself.</b>  What does networking mean to
you? If you
put it in a context that's more exciting for you, then you will be more
likely to take the
actions necessary to make contacts. The standard definitive word for getting
contacts is
"networking," but you can come up with a word that still describes it, yet
doesn't make
you sick every time you think about it. A word that I use is
"connecting"--connecting with
people and learning how you can be resources for each other. It's about
socializing,
learning, and, hey, even about having fun! It's free publicity--a chance to
say who you
are, what you do and what you're up to in the world. Think of it as a big
game. Getting to
know people is a job in and of itself. You can learn much about someone in one
conversation. For example, the last trip I took consisted of a three-hour
plane ride. I
asked for a window seat, but the travel agent warned me that the plane was
booked and
I'd be sitting by someone. In other words, it would be very crowded and I
wouldn't be
having the middle seat all to myself. So, armed with my Walkman, sunglasses and
earplugs, I was ready for anyone to sit next to me. Well, it turns out this
person was
reading a book I was reading, looked to be about my age, and he was very
friendly. I
started talking about the book and the conversation took off. It turns out
he was interested
in the concept of coaching and had many friends who might be interested. I
gained a new
contact--and maybe several more. And it was a very enjoyable flight.</P>

<P>2. <b>Know who you are.</b>  A ridiculous statement, right? Well, if I asked
you to
describe yourself in seven seconds or less, could you do it?  Maybe, but not
very
effectively. The seven-second rule implies that first impressions happen in
the first
seven seconds of meeting someone. Be clear about what you want people to be
left with
after you meet them. Having answers to these questions will help you
formulate your
introduction. What is your vision in life? What are your goals? What
distinguishes you
from other people? What are your strengths? What can you provide for people?
How can
you support them? How can you provide service to them? Other people can't be
comfortable with who you are unless you are first. Once you are more
comfortable with
who you are, and what you have to offer, you can give away information more
easily, and
with a style that's all yours. People will realize what a resource you are,
and they will
likely to think of you when connecting other people to you. Be the fearless
one. Make the
first move. People are just as scared as you are. Go for it!</P>

<P>3. <b>Action--my favorite part.</b>  Connecting with people can be fun, and just
like anything else, it takes practice. The most difficult thing for me was
(and still is) just
opening my mouth. Once that's open, I'm fine. Make yourself known to the world.
Imagine how your life would be different if you could meet at least two new
people a
month. You will definitely have a fuller social life, and probably a more
productive
professional life. Get out there and volunteer, go to those parties that you
don't want to
go to, find out what events are happening in your area through your local
newspaper. Is
your address book updated? Better yet, do you have a database in which all
your contacts
are stored? How long has it been since you've talked with some of those
people? Who are
the professors at your university with whom it would be a good idea to stay
in touch? 
You never know, they may know the person who will help you land that perfect
job--but you
have to open your mouth.  </P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/tellus.html">By Bill Thornbro</A></P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=LEFT SRC="quitscap.gif" ALT="W">hile other employees chat in the breakroom about their jobs or boyfriends,
Donna is
quietly planning. She's already used four vacation days for job interviews,
and she's pretty
certain the last one will call back with an offer. But how does she quit her
current job?</P>

Paula Martin quit, just walked in and quit. She didn't hate her job. She
even liked her
supervisor. But a better job for more money made the decision easy. "I
offered them two-weeks notice and got out of the room before I cried," says Martin. "I still
talk to a lot of
those girls and went to one of their (baby) showers."</P>

Is there a good way to quit a job? Could it be the way a person leaves a job
is every bit as
important as the way they accept it? Yes, says Jason R. Rich, author of
<i>First Job,
Great Job: America's Hottest Business Leaders Share Their Secrets</i>. "You
can still
hate the person, but leave on positive terms. You don't have to say, 'Screw
you,' and
leave," says Rich.</P>

Donna has wanted to quit for nearly a year. She feels neglected and she's
certain she's
been passed over for promotions unfairly. Now she wants to go out in a blaze
of glory.
She wants to wave her arms, point fingers in faces and cuss at the top of
her lungs. She
wants to quit now--today--before she has anything lined up. Donna knows if
she leaves
now, she'll be sticking her boss with a lot of work. It appeals to her.</P>

"They won't be happy (I quit)," says Donna. "I can kiss ass and hope I get a
good
recommendation, or I can make a statement. I'd love to tell them what they
can do with
their job."</P>

<P>Rich sees a couple of problems. The desire to make a statement is one of
them. "First,
you're always going to be running into the same people if you stay within an
industry.
That's pretty critical. (The boss) may wind up at your company in six months
or a year
from now. He could be your boss again," says Rich. "There are only so many
people
qualified for certain jobs. If you're on non-speaking terms with someone,
that could come
back to haunt you."</P>

<P>If you "can maintain a good relationship, it can pay off in the future. Plus
there's the
recommendation. That carries a lot more weight than a professor or a
co-worker. If that
boss is still speaking very highly of you, that says a lot," says Rich.</P>

<P>Martin used her old boss as a reference, although she isn't sure what kind of
recommendation she received. <IMG  ALIGN=LEFT SRC="quitsquote.gif">"I thought it would be tacky to ask," she says.
"Anyway,
we always got along. If there was a problem, I'm sure she'd tell me." </P>

<P>"I deal with a lot of editors at different magazines because they change jobs
every three to
five years," says Rich. "It's smart to have a positive relationship with
them because I
never know when one might call me out of the blue to say they have a job for
me."</P>

<P>Donna knows all that. "That's what I'd <i>like</i> to do," she says. "It
won't happen. I'll
think about it between now and then, but I'm not that kind of person inside,
you know. I'd
chicken out. I'm not a hot-headed person. It'll just be good to get out of
there."</P>

<P>Rich says it also would be a mistake to leave without having "something
lined up. Things
always go wrong and you don't want to be caught without a job. Even if you
hate your
job, hate your boss, hate everything about it."</P>

<P>Martin's only regret is she couldn't give two weeks notice. The new job was
in the same
city, but the offer required her to start the following week. "I wish I'd
explained that I
couldn't do that to my old boss. But I took the job and didn't even think
about it."</P>

<P>"It goes beyond being professional," advises Rich. "You make an effort to
train the next
person and help with the transition. These days it's something you need to
do. It makes
you look more professional, but it's also the right thing to do, the right
ethical thing to do.
At least make the offer."</P>

<P>Donna says she'll probably offer two weeks notice, mostly because she'll
need the last
paycheck. Rich says it could be a moot point.</P>

<P>"Some companies might not want you around," he says. "They don't even want
you going
back to your desk. They don't want you around the client data base or
computer records
or anything. They want you out of the building. But two weeks is still the
right thing to
do."</P>

<BR><BR>
<BR><BR><A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/tellus.html">By Cassandra Anderson</A></P>



<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="idiotcap.gif" ALT="J">anuary. What a bummer. Christmas is over and Santa has taken his elves, his
reindeer and his sleigh back to the North Pole and left you with a Visa bill
that differs
from the national debt only by two decimal point places. Even worse, the
polar ice caps
have graciously expanded their territory to include your backyard, much of
your driveway
and Roy, your dog. Such bleak surroundings leave most people longing for
excitement.
Unless you've suffered a blow to the head in the last 20 years or so, you've
probably
noticed that most people find that excitement in basketball.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, if you're not into the hoop thing, the end of January may
find you playing
drinking games to informercials by yourself. And that's not something you'll
live down in
the near future. This article has been written for survival--survival for
the few non-sports
folks flanked by basketball fanatics and have an entire winter staring them
in the face.
Keep reading and you'll find a way to enjoy a basketball game in your own
creative way.
With a properly feigned love for the game, the winter will zip by in no time.</P>

<P><b>Tip #1: Get a Sporting Attitude</b></P>
<P>Most people have a natural enthusiasm for basketball that comes from a genuine
enjoyment of the sport. This is hard to fake. But the next best thing is to
get caught in the
bulk of traffic on the way to the game. A mere 15 minutes in
bumper-to-bumper traffic is
sufficient to create a hearty <i>competitive</i>  spirit. And for the extra
spirit that
tournament games require, attempt to find a parking spot close to the arena.</P>


<P><b>Tip #2:  Forget the Rules</b></P>
<P>Many people will tell you that the first rule in learning to like basketball
is learning the
rules. This is simply not true. Not knowing the rules is the only way to
truly enjoy the
game. Basically, the rules are pretty boring. They're merely a matter of
points and not
touching people. It's much more fun to hear the ref call something and then
guess what
the call was. For example, a personal foul really means a player has
attempted to keep his
opponent from scoring by touching/pushing/shoving. For some reason this is
not allowed.
But if you let your ignorance guide you, you can guess that it's a euphemism
for nailing a
cheerleader in the locker room. And that's certainly more exciting than some
guy tapping
another player on the wrist.</P>

<P><b>Tip #3: Yell at the Referee</b></P>
<P>You've probably noticed that basketball fans have an active and exciting
dialogue with
the players, coaches and referees. No doubt you've wanted to join in but
haven't because
you didn't know what was appropriate. A good rule of thumb is to insult the
referee.
Almost no one likes him so your chances of offending your fellow fans are
slim--you
don't even have to know who you're rooting for. Addressing a referee with a
typical
obscenity is usually sufficient. Comparing his eyesight with grandma's is
equally fitting.
And, if you're feeling especially ornery, feel free to question his
sexuality as well.</P>

<P><b>Tip #4: Always Cheer</b></P>
<P>The easiest way to know when and how to cheer is to learn the rules. But
we've already
established that as an unnecessary and arduous task. Besides, there are
other things you
can do while people are cheering for the players. Cheering is <i>very</i>
loud. It's the
perfect time to get bothersome information off your chest. When everyone
else is yelling
about defense, simply yell out what you had for lunch or the fact that you enjoy
pornography a great deal. No one can hear you over all the noise, and you'll
find a
confession in front of so many people is quite liberating.</P>

<P><b>Tip #5: There's Always a Way Out</b></P>
<P>The tips included so far are probably enough to get you started on a
lifetime of basketball
enjoyment. But always remember, the best part about your love of basketball
is the fact
that you don't care for it. So if all else fails, you can devise an endless
number of plans to
be ejected from the arena. One good way is to sit near the band and
continually throw
Baby Ruth bars in the Sousaphones. If you aren't familiar with this
instrument, just chuck
your candy at the musicians themselves. This should get you kicked out in
about 10
minutes. For faster ejection, throw cheese-covered nachos. But perhaps the most
immediate way to make a grand exit is to join the cheerleaders in their
cheering wearing
nothing but one of those oversized foam rubber hands.</P>

<P>There you have it--all the tips you need to actively enjoy something that merely
annoyed you
before. Practice and soon you'll not only be able to fraternize and share
experiences with
your fanatical peers, but you'll find the winters simply fly by.</P>

<IMG ALT="E"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="e2.jpeg">     rin Haggerty, 22, a senior at Indiana University and a member of the IMU Outfitters on the Bloomington campus, agrees. "It's really great," she says. Because fear of falling is so natural, Haggerty says beginners are sometimes encouraged to take a tumble early and get the fear out of their system, freeing the climbers to concentrate on climbing.</P>

<IMG SRC="climb5.jpeg" ALIGN=RIGHT>



<P>"You have to fall once to feel comfortable when you're a first-time climber," says Haggerty.</P>



<P>Experienced climbers don't all have single-digit body fat, perfect cholesterol levels, and joints that work without creaking. It just seems that way. And along with odd-looking rubber shoes, real climbers often wear skin-tight Spandex, which only accentuates the near-anorexic appearance of many of these athletes.</P>





<P>Chris Bowman says it's a great sport to whip you in shape. Although he prefers mountaineering (a style that combines outdoor climbing with hiking), he enjoys/appreciates traditional climbing (where climbers insert devices in rock cracks and then run their ropes through the anchored devices as they climb) and sport climbing (similar to indoor in that the devices are already in place). Bowman likes mountaineering because "you've got a pack on and you've got a destination."</P>

<IMG ALT="W"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="w2.jpeg">   ill Chalker, 10, of Indianapolis, is sold on indoor climbing, although he says he loves skiing and hockey more. Anne, Will's mother, recently threw a birthday party for Will and his friends at Climb Time. "It's hard on your hands," Will says. "My hands are all really red."</P>





<P>"Once you have a callus it doesn't hurt as much," his mom says. "It toughens you up." Will didn't look convinced.</P>

<P>Anne never felt she or her son were in peril as they climbed. "It's a wonderful way to get over your fear (of heights), I think," Anne says. </P>

<P>"You get to experience what climbing really is in a safe environment. It's also very fun."</P>

<P>A lot of people don't understand why we like to do it," Chris Bowman says. "You can only understand why once you've done it."</P>

<P>Bowman says he likes the challenge and sense of accomplishment, but perhaps the better answer is decades old. Shortly after climbing Mt. Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary was asked why. Why'd you do it, man?</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>A</FONT>s new pieces fall into place, a quite different puzzle may start to take shape. You can define this career puzzle more accurately by also doing informational interviewing. Approach employers in professions you're researching and set up interviews where you can ask detailed questions about the career. According to Bernstein, when you're doing informational interviewing, you're "not trying to get a job." Informational interviewing will also help you figure out how you fit into that career.</P>





<P><IMG WIDTH=324 HEIGHT=127  SRC="pullquote.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>If your interests lie in a career field that you have no experience in, there are ways to prepare yourself. "Match your skills and interests knowing that skills can be acquired," says Rogers. To acquire the skills doesn't necessary mean packing up everything you own and heading back to <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/sept/features/degree/degree1.html">pursue another degree</A>. "You can go back to school and take a class," says Rogers. "Find the things that you can do to go above and beyond to show an employer that you're interested in that career." You can also volunteer or take a job as a <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/may/work/game/game.html">temp</A>.</P>





<P>Vassallo says you may have decided on "the industry but not the profession." A major advantage to doing temporary work is it's easier to get a job if you already have one. A lot of "companies have really signed on to the whole idea of using temporaries in their business," says Vassallo. Another advantage is you're able to try several different jobs without the fear of it looking like you're job hopping.</P>





<P>If you're 26 years old, "living at home and you've had 10 jobs in the last 10 months, then there's a problem," says Rogers. And according to several of the hiring managers ENTER's spoken with, conservative companies tend to frown on frequent job change. "Moving around a lot is something you'll have to explain," says Vassallo. "It may make an employer uneasy."</P>





<P>At this point you're ready to put the final pieces in place by looking for a job. According to Bernstein, you'll be able to speak the lingo of your chosen profession and explain coherently what it is you're looking for in a job. "You're using very sophisticated psychological thinking to approach your career," says Bernstein.</P>





<P>Armed with this knowledge, you're making it easier for an employer to make a decision between you and someone who just wants a job but isn't as familiar with the profession. "There's nothing worse than graduating and being a 'job beggar.' Someone who walks around and says, 'Can you give me job?'" says Bernstein. </P>

<IMG WIDTH=54 HEIGHT=58 ALT="F"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dropcap.gif">or years you've been piecing together the employment puzzle. You get an education, write a resume, do an interview or two and get hired. But as you assemble your future, have you built the career you want to spend the rest of your life pursuing?</P>





<P>The daily grind, frustration and career anxiety can build at an unreal pace, and you're left wondering just where you're heading. "You should always be thinking: Am I really successful? Am I going somewhere? Do I like what I'm doing?" says Diane Rogers, a graduate placement officer at Illinois State University.</P>





<P>You may have jumped right into work after college and now realize that "your A in Poetry doesn't help you in your new career," says Alan Bernstein, author of <I>The Princeton Review Guide To Your Career</I>. The best way to avoid a potential mid-life crisis at age 26 is to begin by identifying your skills, needs and interests, says Bernstein. You need to identify whether your current career path is one that you want to follow, but keep in mind, "there's no such thing as a lifetime career," says Bernstein.</P>





<P>Ask yourself what you enjoy doing in life? Do you enjoy creating, organizing, controlling, working with people, numbers or tools. This isn't about work at this point, it's about you. "Isolate the interests you have and your needs," says Bernstein. The more literal you are about your assessment the better off you'll be, because you can match those interests with a profession.</P>





<P>What happens if you've wrenched out every last thought onto paper and the career you're already in isn't the one you want? "There's some people who are in a job for a week and say, 'I made a mistake,'" says Susan Vassallo, corporate communications manager at Olsten Staffing. But you may be able to reshape the position or move to another division within the company. "There's always something with any job that you won't like," says Rogers. "But you need to ask yourself, <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/june/work/awful/awful1.html">can you take it?</A>"</P>





<P>If the career you desire lies outside of your current company, you'll need to start gathering information about the industry and people that shape and make the career you've identified. "You're becoming a researcher and the research paper you're writing is called My Career," says Bernstein.</P>



 

<P>You can get the best information about a new profession by meeting with  people in that field. Find out what associations represent that profession and when they hold meetings. According to Bernstein, "It's important to expose yourself to the lifestyle of that profession."</P>





<P>Vassallo agrees, adding, "You need to network and you need to belong to organizations." It's possible you could meet someone at a meeting that has made a similar transition to the one your wanting to make.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Jeff Morris</A>



<P>I don't know about you, but when I think of the month with the biggest single meal of the year, I get a hankering to sample some videos. Every year, Hollywood and independent companies produce a smorgasbord of movies. Yet the American public demands more of the same tasteless story recipes they've been swallowing for years. Who would have thought, for example, a predictable movie about a Southern simpleton would become the mega-blockbuster <I>Forrest Gump</I>? Gump was an entertaining movie. We laughed. We cried. But the most surprising thing about this film is that it won best picture.</P>





<P>So, in honor of Thanksgiving and The Big Fill, we're serving up the tastiest turkeys on celluloid, movies that were tremendously entertaining but aren't exactly the filling films American movie-going public craves. Try a couple before spitting them out into your napkin:</P>


<BR>



<P><B>SUDDENLY, LAST SUMMER</B> (1959) Elizabeth Taylor, Katherine Hepburn. 114 mins. B&W. Imagine the controversary around Taylor starring as a disturbed young woman who brings home a dark secret (no, not another husband) after accompaning her homosexual cousin on trips to Europe. Hepburn is Liz's eccentric aunt, the only person who knows her bizarre secrets The sympathetic doctor, played by Montgomery Clift, decides to help Liz but can't seem to find out the whole story. Penned by Gore Vidal and based on the acclaimed Tennessee Williams play, disturbing ending is certain to shock.</P>




<P>Also with Taylor: National Velvet, A Place In The Sun, Cat On A Hot Tin Roof. Butterfield 8, Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?</P>


<BR>



<P><B>DEFENDING YOUR LIFE</B> (1991) Meryl Streep, Albert Brooks. 112 mins. Color. In this ingenious comedy, writer-director-actor Brooks is killed in an auto accident and arrives in the most unusual afterlife: Judgment City, an ethereal resort with the most incredible food. In Judgment City, he's put on trial for his mistakes on Earth. If he wins, he moves on to a higher plane of existence. If he loses, it's back to Earth to try again. (No wonder there are so many lawyers on Earth.) During deliberations, Brooks meets the woman of his dreams (Streep) and falls in love. Look for a hilarious cameo by Shirley MacLaine.</P>





<P>Also by Brooks: Real Life, Modern Romance, Lost In America.</P>


<BR>



<P><B>AFTER HOURS</B> (1985) Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette. 97 mins. Color. Urban paranoia in this dark comedy from director Martin Scorsese. Dunne stars as a bored yuppie whose chance encounter with a girl leads him through a harrowing night of mistaken identity, accidental death and bloodthirsty mobs. Also starring Terri Garr, John Heard, Linda Fiorentino.</P>





<P>Also by Scorsese: Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Last Temptation Of Christ, Goodfellas.</P>

<BR>




<P><B>INTO THE NIGHT</B> (1985) Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum. 115 mins. Color. Directed by John Landis, this comedy-thriller stars Goldblum as a harried nebbish who can't seem to sleep. (Probably due to what's happened to his career) One night, he runs into mystery woman Pfeiffer who involves him in international intrigue. Watch for several cameos that range from David Bowie to Dan Aykroyd to a score of Hollywood's top directors.</P>





<P>Also with Pfeiffer: Ladyhawke, Dangerous Liasons, Married To The Mob, The Fabulous Baker Boys, Frankie & Johnny.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>E</FONT>very piece of clothing is chosen with care to present just the right image. You even arrive early. And when you finally make it through the door, you greet everyone with respect because they might have influence with the one you're really there to see.</P>





<P>It's a job interview.</P>





<P>You may have spent hours deciding what to wear or say, not realizing that a series of smiles, handshakes, head nods and subconcious nervous gestures and body postures would be just as important to your ability to land a job.</P>





<P>Body language is touted as a key factor in romantic relationships, but it also plays a substantial role in job interviews. Most experts on interviewing suggest the interviewer has decided whether or not to ask you back within the first five minutes. So every move you make counts. Along with clothes, hair, general appearance and punctuality, body language matters because nothing is overlooked in a job interview.</P>





<P>How can you use non-verbal communication to make the best first impression?</P>





<P>Ken Ayres, an associate instructor of communications and a professional with years of hiring experience, tells his students to "be brief, be sincere and be seated." Ayres says the same rules apply to job interviews.</P>





<P>>One key--and easily overlooked--non-verbal skill important in interviewing is listening. "It is the first learned, least taught, and most used skill we have," says Ayres. Ironically, you will probably spend more than 40 percent of your life communicating and never take a class in good listening. Being a good listener means you look at the interviewer and let them know with head nods and other ways that you understand <IMG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=227 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="sitsmile1.gif">what they are saying. A careful listener is able to restate what the interviewer has said.</P>





<P>Ayres suggests keeping the interview at a conversational tone. If there is more than one interviewer, be sure to look at all of them and not just the person that asked you the question.</P>





<P>Here are some other tips:</P>





<P>Have a firm handshake. Some books say "one squeeze." Make good and continuous eye contact; it demonstrates confidence and indicates an interest in the conversation and the position. Exhibit good posture; you appear more professional and alert than someone that is slouched. While you have good posture, you also want to appear comfortable and relaxed, so sit back in your chair.</P>





<P>Also avoid excessive hand gesturing because, according to Ayres, it will make you appear nervous and it can distract from what you are saying. </P>

Don't pace or fidget; this behavior makes you appear nervous, which you have every right to be--but why advertise? Don't talk to receptionists beyond letting them know you are there for an appointment; they have work to do and probably don't want to be bothered. Avoid putting your hands on your mouth or chin; it will make it harder for you to be understood and you are more likely to mumble. Don't swing a crossed leg. Also, don't poke your head around corners or doorways; it could be interpreted as being tentative. Remember, you want to give the impression of confidence.</P>





<P>When it comes to more verbal communication--answering questions, for example--Ayres says there is a tendency to ramble, specially if you're nervous. Instead, try to be short and to the point.</P>





<P>Here's a comforting thought. Ayres says that you should be aware that most interviewers have never been trained to interview. They may be just as nervous as you. The best thing to do is to prepare well for the interview which will make you more at ease, and in turn the interviewer. Call ahead and find out how many people will be interviewing you, where the interview will be held, and how long it will last. Find out if you will be asked to make any presentations.</P>





<P>Ayres says interviewers are not only looking for someone with the correct skills and experience and educational background, they are looking for someone that is a "fit," someone that will be able to work well with other personnel, a team player.</P>





<P>George Anderson, director of training and development at General Electric, also stresses the importance of preparing for the interview. "At GE we're looking for independent, high energy people that can think on their feet, so that's what we look for in interviews," says Anderson, adding that those might not be the same qualities that a bank or other organization would look for.</P>





<P>By researching the company you'll be interviewing with, you will know more about what they look for in employees. You can then concentrate on reflecting those qualities during your interview. If the company is looking for aggressive sales people, then you might want to make aggressive non-verbal communications like taking a chair before one has been offered, whereas if you are interviewing with a hotel company you would want to be friendly and smile often.</P>





<P>Like Ayres, Anderson instructs avoiding any body language that says you are nervous. More than any thing else, he is watching to see that the interviewee is comfortable with themselves and confident.</P>





<P>There are many theories on non-verbal communication and their interpretation, says Anderson. "Everyone has there own little ideas on if he does this then it means this.  If she does that then it means that," he says. Unfortunately, studies have not given any conclusive evidence to support these ideas, so choosing an employee is still a difficult project and knowing just how to hold your head will not help you. Anderson suggests being yourself and exuding as much confidence as you can muster. </P>

<!--IMG  ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="http://www.entermag.com/nov/work/postal/postaltoon.gif">

<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>L</FONT>ike many college students, I had to work a variety of jobs to help cover all the fees that came with getting a degree. One job seems to rise to the top of the heap when the "misery factor" is taken into consideration.</P>

<P>I worked as a laborer in an ice-making factory. We made all types: blocks, 10- and 30- pound bags, and crushed ice. I mainly worked on the bagged ice. </P>

<P>The building was basically a freezing warehouse that had a few small offices in the front, a garage for the trucks to be repaired in on the side, an area where equipment could be assembled and serviced, and a large area in the back where all the ice was made and stored. That was where I worked.</P>

<P>The room was always around 18 to 29 bone-chilling degrees. </P>

<P>We worked seven days a week, and you never knew how long you would be there. We started at 6 am, and worked until all of the palettes were restocked. Basically, the daily routine was like this: We'd get to work and "suit up"--even though it may already be in the 80s outside, we'd have to put on long underwear, two or three pairs of socks, long-sleeve shirts, a winter coat, gloves and a hat. Then we'd head in and take our positions at the bagging machine. This machine would drop ice down into the plastic bag, then send it down a three-foot conveyor to a banding mechanism that would snap a piece of wire around the top, sealing in the ice. If you've ever tried opening one of these bags, you know what I'm talking about. Right after it was banded, the bag needed to be grabbed and thrown to someone standing over the palette, who would stack them in rows. We took turns throwing and catching the bags, about 300 a turn.</P>

<P>It's hard to say which job was worse. If you were at the bagging end, you had to stand with your back bent just enough to make you feel like Quasimodo after about six hours, but if you were on the catching end, you had to run around the palette stacking the bags, making you sweat-shiver-sweat all day. On either end, you were guaranteed wet, freezing hands after around five minutes of work.</P>

<P>The only relief came during lunch and one of two 15-minute breaks we were given. It was during these breaks that I had time to examine some of my co-workers. One in particular fascinated me. While I would exit the cooler and quickly peel off layers before I sweat too much, he would flop his 250-plus pound carcass down on the dock just  outside the cooler door. From there he'd drift into the alcohol-induced coma he had his mother wake him from just to get him to work. The heavy scent of gin or tequila (whichever was cheaper the night before) would hang like a mushroom cloud around his dead weight. Then just when I'd managed to get stripped down enough to avoid heat stroke, I'd have to dress again to go back to work. Drunk-Boy would awkwardly roll to his feet and join us.</P>

<P>Drunk-Boy's other job around the factory was fixing the rusted-out or busted-up ice boxes. He worked in a 10 foot-by-10 foot area spraying paint, applying and sanding bondo, without any kind of face mask. I believe the fumes were the snack that kept him going until his nightly binge. There was a small fan mounted in one of the walls, but he rarely ran it, except when it was so hot the 100-proof sweat was stinging his eyes.</P>

<P>I worked there with a few friends for one summer. We had one day off that came 22 days after I started. I have since gone on and finished college--as have my friends--but I often wonder if Drunk-Boy is still at it, bondo-ing away in his own slow-death Kevorkian fashion. </P>

<FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT>n the constantly changing, increasingly complex world we live in, it's easy to become overwhelmed, especially at work. If the experts are right, stress is eating us alive, and even if you're one of those rare people not under stress on the job, you're working with stressed-out people who can adversely affect your career with their poor decisions, performance and attitude.  </P>





<P>Stress and burnout can occur at almost any job at any time. Police officers, firefighters, social servants, doctors, teachers--any job with extreme demands and responsibilities can create stress. Number-crunching accountants can suffer from stress. Journalists who need to meet deadline after deadline can implode under the conditions. Human resource professionals who deal with the worst personnel problems can suffer from unbearable stress. Nobody's immune.</P>



<P>How bad is stress in the modern workplace? Debbie Brandt, a nurse, sees stressed-out people all the time. Not only does Brandt believe stress costs workers and companies in time off the job, but she claims she can trace a number of disability claims to stress. "I'd say 50 percent. It might be higher," she says. "I think a lot of injuries on the job are stress-related. You're more careless in your job performance." </P>

<P>Victims of stress often suffer more physical problems, including headaches, colds and back problems. Lack of sleep and substance abuse is not uncommon, according to experts.  </P>

<P>Recognizing symptoms of stress has become an important part of a healthy work environment. Today's team-oriented management expects every member to be able to be able to perform. When workers can't complete their tasks or deliver the quality needed, the group suffers, the company suffers, careers suffer. Stress costs everybody money. More companies are talking about stress management, and the smart ones are looking for ways to find the sources of stress and mental-health problems.</P>

<P>Wendy Tanenbaum, a California-based independent consultant and executive television producer, agrees that high stress levels at work will hurt productivity and eventually affect a company's bottom line.</P>

<P><IMG WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=265 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="http://www.entermag.com/dec/work/stress/stress1.gif">Signs of stress include increased anxiety, frustration, job dissatisfaction and anger. Stressed workers can become irritable, overly emotional, or display fits of extreme hostility. Some workers express feelings of meaninglessness or withdraw socially, becoming inaccessible to co-workers. 
</P>
<P>What causes stress at work? Just about everything. Job instability and fear of unemployment are very common causes, according to human resource pros. Many companies have gone to smaller work forces and increased individual work loads and time demands. A stress sufferer may feel they're always digging their way out of  impossible piles of work. For others, constant change, new technologies and the need for more education can be a problem. Unfamiliar tasks, territorial co-workers and ambiguous roles can create stress. Add lack of creative stimulation and stagnant, boring jobs. Who wouldn't be stressed if they felt they had zero influence or were trapped in ridged monotonous routines?</P>

<P><IMG WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=243 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="http://www.entermag.com/dec/work/stress/stress2.gif">"There's a certain threshold that each person reaches in combination with their personal life and their professional life where they just can't do anymore and they're not capable of anything more," says Tanenbaum. "Even the work that they're putting out is not really the quality that they are capable of."</P>

<P>Don't forget the boss as a source of stress. Working with or for in-your-face workaholics or passive-aggressive types can contribute to problems, say mental health professionals. Anxious or indecisive people can ruin your day--and dent your career. Lack of recognition can eat at your heart and stomach. Sexual or individual harassment can destroy you. Tyrants can work you to death.</P>

<P>"I think some people right out of college think that's the only way that there is: to work 24 hours a day and to be abused verbally. They don't know anything else," says Tanenbaum. "A manager that's been there for five years may also feel they have to do this because it's the only way to move up."</P>

<P>"I really think there's a difference between supervisors expecting that from the employees and the employees wanting to be there to finish a project," says Tanenbaum.</P>

<P>Experts in the environmental sciences say improper ventilation, insufficient lighting or a lack of personal privacy can contribute to job stress.</P>

<P>Personal problems often compound work-related stress. A person worried about things at home--the health of loved ones, financial woes and lack of time--can magnify minor problems on the job.</P>

<P>What can you do about stress?</P>

<P>Workers need to take responsibility for their stress, and experts recommend adequate exercise, improved diet, methods of relaxation and lifestyle changes. Companies can do their part to provide a healthy work environment by constantly evaluating policies, improving communication and providing employees with counseling and a way to air grievances.</P>

<P>But Debbie Brandt says too many companies don't deal well with mental-health issues. For some workers, "if you're depressed and you call in to say you can't get out of bed, they look at you like your stupid. As soon as management finds out your depressed, they assume you're a risk. There's a stigma to it."</P>

<P><IMG WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=263 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="http://www.entermag.com/dec/work/stress/stress3.gif">When Wendy Tanenbaum worked as vice president of the consumer marketing division at Hillon and Knowlton, she noticed stress levels had reached the breaking point for most of her employees. She tried a unique approach to get employees "out of the office and into an environment that would relax them a little and allow them to get to know each other outside of their work environment." Tanenbaum and employees spent part of their working morning at the Hollywood Bowl, eating breakfast outside and listening to the L.A. Philharmonic.</P>

<P>"Unfortunately, I hate to say this, I don't think a lot companies view something like that as productive," says Tanenbaum. According to Tanenbaum, most companies would view going to the Hollywood Bowl as a perk or social activity. "People's attitudes for the next few days were unbelievable. Everyone looked like it recharged them and it rejuvinated them. No one took lunch because they didn't want to," says Tanenbaum. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>E</FONT>ditor's Note: <I>Had a job you absolutely hated? Wanna whine, bitch or gripe about an old boss? Get it off your chest by sending your experience to your favorite rant-and-rave column, </I> <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/tellus.html">Let's Get Postal.</A> </B></P>

<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>N</FONT>o matter how bad you think your job is, nothing is worse than dodging speeding semis and blind grandmas in deadly Lincolns and Caddys. I had an uncle and brother who used to work for the county highway department and they got me a job as a flagman for one summer while I was in college, and I thought it would be like the perfect way to kill a summer. The money and overtime was great, but I don't miss it now. No way.</P>

<P>I was mooned more than once. I had fast-food trash and cups thrown at me. I was yelled at. I baked out there in hot boots and way too many clothes. Basically, only my neck and arms got a great tan. Once I caught a couple of butthead frat boys stealing orange cones. I don't know how they thought they were going to get away since it was only one lane with traffic in front and behind them. One woman flashed me (that was cool), but usually it was just the same monotonous garbage every day.</P>

<P>You got a lot of time to look around when you're just standing there with a sign, and some of the stuff along the highways were pretty amazing. You wouldn't believe the crap people throw out of their cars. I saw everything--shoes, panties, dentures and a lot of old rubbers. And tons of rotting, stinking roadkill, every kind of rude deer, dog, cat, 'coon, etc., you can imagine. On the plus side, I also found a lot of change and one watch. But no billfolds, though.</P>

<P>That was my job, to stand there looking stupid with a big "slow" sign in my hand while cars and trucks screamed by. Sometimes the cars would get so close I thought I was lunchmeat. Most of them slowed down, naturally, but I'm convinced it's way too easy to get a driver's license in this dumb country. Once when one guy popped his clutch and his car lurched forward, I thought that was it, I'm a dead man. I was always having little instant heart attacks like that and I don't miss it at all.</P>

<IMG WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=40 ALT="T"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tdrop.gif">he angry white men were quiet. Many of them had supported Proposition 209, the California initiative eliminating affirmative action in public jobs and college admissions. They said they were tired of race and gender preferences. Affirmative action wasn't necessary, they claimed. Then came Texaco and the angry white men were silent. </P>

<P>In the days after the election in November, tapes made in 1994 of executives at Texaco using racist language were released to the public. The executives were discussing a discrimination lawsuit against Texaco when some of the men in the room were caught openly considering destroying evidence connected to the suit, using racial epithets, and complaining about Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. A couple of the employees described black employees as "black jelly beans."</P>

<P>Texaco settled out of court, but it would not be the last job fairness issue to surface that month. Avis was next. A former manager of an Avis Rent-A-Car franchise in North Carolina claimed the owner gave employees instructions on how to deny rentals to black customers. Employees who failed to comply were denied bonuses or had their pay docked.</P>

<P>Then it was announced in November that several cases of sexual harassment and forced sexual misconduct were reported on Army bases. Instructors on base were allegedly forcing young women to have sex.</P>

<P>"Is there discrimination? There is," says David Mirza, chairman of the economics department at Loyola University in Chicago. "The reality has not changed; the reality is the same. It's just been brought to the attention of all of us. The Texaco thing just brings it out in the open."</P>

<P>California Gov. Pete Wilson talked about fairness as he promoted Propostion 209. Candace Gingrich, a spokesman for Human Rights Watch, the country's largest gay and lesbian political organization, talks about fairness, too. "To me it's such a basic ideal in our country, the belief that one is judged by their ability to perform a particular job or duty rather than judged on something that has nothing to do with ability."</P>

<P>It would appear everybody wants fairness. Why is it so many people--whites and blacks and women and gays and lesbians--see fairness differently?</P>

<P>Gingrich, who is the half-sister of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, doesn't have an answer. Fairness is a simple concept to her.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>"T</FONT>he first real job I had was at United Parcel Service where basically if you move X number of boxes an hour, they don't care if you're a tree," she says smiling. "As long as you can do it, that's what they care about. I wish everyone had that knowledge that they can walk into the workplace and know they're going to be judged by the work they can do."</P>

<P>Fairness, Gingrich says, means "the same opportunities, rights and protections that non- gay people have." But how do you get protection for your group when states like California are striking <i>down</i> affirmative action laws? Are laws protecting rights even necessary?</P>

<P><IMG WIDTH=324 HEIGHT=82 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="fairquote.gif">"In 41 states you can be fired from your job for being gay, somebody hears a rumor that you're gay," says Gingrich. "And you have no legal recourse to challenge that. "You could have been the most qualified person, you could have been doing your job, you could have been getting awards and promotions. But if somebody finds out you're gay or hears a rumor, they can fire you and there's nothing you can do about it."</P>

<P>Mirza isn't sure new laws prohibiting workplace discrimination will work. Companies that routinely discriminate are unlikely to change the way they do business, he suggests. "If you have a law that says you can't do X, there will always be people who will do Y, which is real close to X," says Mirza.</P>

<P>"Did the tailhook scandal eliminate sexual harassment? No," he says. "On the margin, there will be less discrimination and sexual harassment" as a result of the recent publicity surrounding Texaco, Avis and the military. But, he adds, "on the margin, people involved in these things will probably just be more careful."</P>

<P>As long as young workers are realistic, Mirza says they should "get the best possible job you can. The environment should be a factor, but whatever the environment is today, it may not be the environment tomorrow."</P>

<P>Gingrich wishes companies would realize "valuing employees for the work they can do makes the best business sense." She hopes young workers think job discrimination is an important issue, one that's worth fighting. Standing up for a belief can be costly, however, and she warns: "Nothing of importance is gained without risking something that's important to you." </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/tellus.html">By Jeff Morris</A></P>



<P>This month we're honoring that time of the year when the whole family gathers to review every humiliating mistake of your past and editorialize on the current direction of your life. In fact, it's amazing how much your parents have in common with
movie critics. They're both critics, of course, only your parents criticize
<i>your</i> career choices instead of Sylvester Stallone's. And they both have
exceptionally bad taste. Remember the Garfield sweater with attached jingle bells you got from Mom last Christmas? Finally, like your parents, movie critics are consumed with the
need to offer advice with no basis in logic.</P>





<P>This year can be different. Fight back by renting the spectacular holiday and family flicks below. Perfect for distracting the conversation or to simply drown out the sermons.</P>

<BR>

<P><B>SCROOGED</B> (1988), Bill Murray, Karen Allen, Color, 111 mins.
Only true holiday cynics can appreciate that irrepressible Dickens, Murray.
In this riotous re-working of the tired "A Christmas Carol," Murray stars as
a commercialized, callous TV executive who gets schooled in the art of
Christmas spirit by some hilarious Christmas spirits including John Forsythe, Carol
Kane and David Johansen. Also starring Bobcat Goldthwait and many others.
</P>

<P>Also with Murray: Caddyshack, Stripes, Little Shop of Horrors, Ghostbusters I
& II, Quick Change, Groundhog Day.</P>

<BR>

<P><B>A CHRISTMAS STORY</B> (1983), Darren McGavin, Melinda Dillon, Color, 93 mins. Peter Billingsley only wants what every red-blooded American boy should have for Christmas. A gun. Actually a Red Ryder Air Rifle. This hilarious and totally entertaining look into a young boy's mind as he attempts everything to get what he really wants for Christmas. His experiences with his parents, his trip to see Santa, and the "dreaded double dog dare," make this one of the funniest holiday movies of all time.</P>

<BR>

<P><B>THE SNOWMAN</B> Animated, Color, 26 mins. Even though I'm not a fan of sappy holiday movies, this Oscar-nominated animated short caught even my cynical side off guard. Using only mime, music and the viewer's imagination, a young boy's Christmas Eve dream sends him and his magically animated snowman on a wonderful journey into each other's world. If
you like this one, check out the sequel--Father Christmas--both from the children's
books by Raymond Briggs.</P>

<BR>




<P><B>PARENTHOOD</B> (1989) Steve Martin, Mary Steenburgen, Color, 120 mins. All right, this is technically not a Christmas movie, but it definitely shows the family dynamics around my house at the holidays. Director Ron Howard traces the ups and downs of three generations of a family and celebrates the eternal parent-child struggle, uh, relationship. Fantastic performances from an all-star cast that includes Rick Moranis, Dianne Wiest, Jason Robards, Martha Plimpton and Keanu Reeves.
</P>

<P>Also with Martin: The Jerk, The Man With Two Brains, Roxanne, Little Shop of Horrors, Planes Trains & Automobiles, My Blue Heaven.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ydrop.gif" ALT="Y">ou've strolled into a dimly lit bar, parched as hell, and headed straight for some liquid enlightenment. You catch the attention of the bartender who asks you to "name your poison." Do you want a scotch straight up, a gin and tonic, whiskey with a beer chaser or a Little Princess Cocktail?</P>

<P>Ah, a Little Princess Cocktail. That exquisite mixture of one-and-a-half ounces of rum and one ounce of sweet vermouth stirred delicately together to make a darling drink guaranteed to get your tender ass dragged outside and beat senseless by burly steamfitters and stevedores who know how to consume alcohol.</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="pull.gif">Certain drinks have a mystique, a rough edge or a sophisticated air about them that defines the character of the person sipping or throwing them down. But other drinks--a Dirty Girl Scout, Freddy Fudpucker, Swimming Ashore for the Songs of Sunrise or the always pleasant Walking to the Call of the Mockingbird don't seem to evoke that John Wayne or James Bond image. A Harvey Wallbanger conjures up a robust image. Bond, who liked his martinis shaken, could ask for a White Russian for a change of pace, knowing nary a waitress or fellow patron would raise an eyebrow. But a Fuzzy Navel is, well, barely fit for human consumption. No, James Bond would have nothing to do with Fuzzy Navels.</P>

<P>There exist drinkers who aren't shy, who can demand a Dirty Girl Scout and do it with pride. Liquor is good, they say, and a Little Princess Cocktail can provide the perfect kick start to a day, evening or weekend. But it takes a special person to order a Sacred Mountain of the Pekingese Cloud Gods. It takes a person who knows that to desire a Flaming Rum Punch in some taverns could get him or her a punch in the nose. Alas, there are drinks that will never be ordered--or whispered--in the confines of your average friendly neighborhood watering hole.</P>

<P>And while it may not be fair that a drink like the delicious Phoebe Snow will remain forgotten in the pages of a bartender's guide, only a few of the oddly named concoctions will be uttered underneath the mounted moosehead at the typical bar and grill. Yeah, it's safe to want a Blowjob. And you can look most bartenders in the eye and say, "How about a Slow Comfortable Screw?" Sex on the Beach? Oh, what a way to end a perfect day. But who among us can reasonably expect the averge barkeep to have committed to memory the ingredients of a Pink Squirrel?</P>

<IMG  Align=left SRC="lotions.gif"><BR><BR><P>If you're looking for something a little more adventurous, you may want to check out something called The Pocket Rocket. It's a mini-massager and the perfect item for anyone interested in a vibrator but intimidated by the thought of owning one. "It's not threatening because it's not phallic-shaped," says Ampeliotis. "That's important to many people, especially women, who have been taught it's bad and are trying to get over that." You can put one of these Pocket Rockets in a Pleasure Mitt for the ultimate in sexual giddiness.</P>

<P>Next stop is the educational shop where you and your lover can create your own little Ivy League of love. Some titles include, <i>Lover's Guide to Better Orgasms</i> and <i>Massage Skills</i>.You can also find instructional videos for anyone who likes to dabble in a little S&M. Suddenly <i>Miracle on 34th Street</i>  is sounding pretty silly, eh?</P>

<P>For those who are feeling really frisky or just inordinately curious, we have the dildo, vibrator and general mechanical pleasuring apparatus category. Here you can find the latest in erotic electronics. There are as many for men as for women. Some are for couples and some necessitate your best guess. You can also explore the world of patent- leather gownless evening straps and enjoy a smorgasbord of innovative and challenging restraining devices.</P>
<IMG  Align=right SRC="loveglove.gif">
<P>You're probably wondering about now what a six-foot inflatable penis is going for these days. You'll be glad to know that no matter what your budget, there is a toy-apparatus- goody that you can afford. All the stuff at Tasty's ranged from about $3 to $125. So you can mix and match items with complete abandon. Feel free to visit Tasty's website: <A HREF="http://www.tastys.com">www.tastys.com</A>. You'll find specifics there.</P>

<P>There you have it. Gift ideas out the wazoo (feel free to take that literally) that are mighty fun to shop for and quite affordable to buy. They're sure to make this Christmas very merry indeed. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT>t's that time again--time to shop until you want to puke up your spleen. And chances are, if you've been participating in this whole gift-giving circus for a couple of decades, you're just about out of ideas. Is it because you're feebleminded? Well, maybe. But it's probably because you haven't been shopping in the right places. For instance, when was the last time you patronized your friendly neighborhood adult gift store?</P>

<P>You think adult gifts are for pervs, freaks and your general raging-hormone ruffian. And, well, that goes without saying. But some shops today--Tasty's gift factory in Indianapolis for one--have a little something for everyone. If you don't believe it, just ask Alisa Ampeliotis, the owner. "A lot of people come to the store around this time of year," she says. "People will buy stuff for office parties, daddies will buy things for mommies and, of course, there's always gag gifts."</P>

<P>It happens there's a lot more to adult gifts than dildos, vibrators and pornography (although that's part of it). "You can find lots of stuff that's simply stress relieving on up to beginner bondage" says Ampeliotis. Bottom line--you might be surprised how many names you could cross off your list with one trip to an adult gift store.</P>

<P>For those who still get embarrassed buying toilet paper, let's start with the most innocuous stuff. For example, you could get that special someone, or even Aunt Betty, an array of luscious smelly things. There are all kinds of incense, bath powders and candles that can relax and rejuvenate even the Grinchiest spirit. And don't forget the chocolate. For most women, the link between chocolate and sexual pleasure isn't much of a leap. For those who haven't experienced this kind of tasting pleasure, chocolates are a must.</P>

<P>Of course, there's no better way to convey your Christmas spirit than a great gag gift. And you'll be glad to know that there are more sexual gag gifts out there than you can shake a boob-shaped coffee mug at. Stuff stockings with things like: Tit Bits bite-sized candies, a blow-up man, glow-in-the-dark condoms and everyone's favorite six-foot inflatable penis, Captain Pecker The Party Wrecker. You can also get some great party games and tastefully produced erotic films.</P>

<P>Now on to something a bit more sensual--Kama Sutra oils, balms and other slippery stuff. There's quite an assortment of massage oils to choose from. Kama Sutra makes several great smelling ones (tasty too) like Serenity, Sweet Almond and, believe it or not, Pralines and Cream. Kama Sutra also makes a very intriguing product called Honey Dust. It's a non-sticky, edible powder made from real honey that you apply with a feather. You might want to try a product by the name of Pleasure Balm. It tastes of peppermint, has a tingling effect and warms up when you breathe on it. There's no need to say more. You'll also find a massage aid called a Pleasure Mitt. It's nubby surface stimulates the skin and, well, feels awful darn good. </P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/tellus.html">By Bill Thornbro</A></P>

<P>Driving is serious business under the best of circumstances, but throw in some fog, snow, ice and freezing rain and suddenly you're in a hopeless spin inside a giant Slushy. Experts say drivers can take a number of steps to reduce the danger of property damage or injury in winter, the most dangerous driving season.</P>

<P>"Nine months of dry roads and people forget how to drive on snow," says service manager Mark Kimmerling. "You've got to be careful and take a little more time. You can't be in a gosh-awful hurry."</P>

<P>The California State Automobile Association, the AAA-affiliated auto club that provides services to more than 3.6 million members throughout northern and central  California, Utah and Nevada notes the number of weather-related injuries and fatalities peak between November and February. </P>

<P>"If you set your alarm for the same time you usually do and figure on getting to work on time, you can forget it. You got to get up earlier to leave earlier. If you don't, you try driving faster to get to work on time and you just can't drive like that in two or three inches of snow. A lot of people do and a lot of people end up in ditches," says Kimmerling.</P>

<P>Kimmerling says even drivers with four-wheel-drive vehicles need to slow down in hazardous conditions. "It's easy to get overconfident," he says. "Those are the guys who'll pass you doing the normal speed limit. I know it's tempting to speed up to keep up with faster vehicles, but I wouldn't do it. It's not worth it."</P>

<P>Cars need three times more space to stop on slick or icy roads, according to CSAA, which recommends keeping a six-to-eight second distance between your car and the car in front of you. CSAA also notes that most skidding happens when drivers make sudden stops or turns. "I tell my daughter to turn off her radio and concentrate on the road and driving," says Kimmerling. "You need to pay attention."</P>

<P>While he's not sure of the physics involved, Kimmerling says if you do go into a slide or skid, you should ease gently off the accelerator and steer toward the skid. Avoid sudden steering changes, however, and don't slam on the brakes. "If you've got anti-lock brakes, don't pump 'em. They used to say to pump your brakes, but with anti-lock brakes you just brake and the (computer) system does the rest."</P>

<P>If you're driving on a wet road and you find your car hydroplaning, gently apply the brakes until you have control again and your car has contact with the road, according to CSAA.</P>

<P>The best advice of all? "Slow down, slow down, slow down," says Kimmerling. "Or if it's that bad, just stay at home. Yeah, drink some hot chocolate." </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT>n light of the explosive discrimination case against Texaco, 
one employee was terminated, two retirees' benefits were permanently suspended and one executive was suspended for two weeks without pay. One of the four men involved, Peter Meade, a manager, will attend a sensitivity and interaction training program after serving his two-week suspension. According to a report in <I>HRNews Online</I>, "Meade was given a lesser punishment because 'there was no evidence that Meade was in the meeting where document destruction was discussed.'"</P>

<P>An independent investigation has prepared and given their report to the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The report focuses on the four employees and their alleged use of racial slurs and destruction of evidence for a racial discrimination lawsuit filed against Texaco. Texaco will not release the results of the investigation, conducted by outside attorney Michael Armstrong. According to a letter to employees from Texaco CEO Peter Bijur, "The U.S. Attorney has informed the company that release of the Armstrong report would interfere with the Government's ongoing investigation and therefore Texaco is not releasing the Armstrong report.

<P>Ralph truly doesn't understand people who aren't into hard work, who don't want to fill their free time with another job, who don't want to go into the office on weekends to do filing.

<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>he veil of secrecy around sending your resume to a company ends here. Three hiring professionals have stepped forward to unravel the mystery of what makes a powerful resume and what happens when your resume hits the hiring desk.</P>





<P>In today's tough job market, many college students and graduates are frustrated with the luke-warm response their resume seems to generate.</P>

 



<P>"I've been sending my resume out, but I haven't heard anything back," says Scott, a college graduate. "Every ad that I send my resume to says don't call. So I don't know what's going on."</P>





<P>What's wrong with the resume you're sending out? Why hasn't it gotten the response you're looking for?</P>





<P>"What is so frustrating about a lot of the resumes I receive is they leave it up to human resources (departments) to figure out how their skills fit into the company," says Sara Veatch, an associate relations manager, with more than eight years of experience. Veatch's eight years have exposed her to resumes from entry-level to executive level positions. "You need to tell me how you fit into the company."</P>





<P>If you're responding to an ad or sending your resume in blind, although it may be difficult, tailor the information to a specific position.
</P>




<P>"Your resume is a set of facts," says W.C. Bird, a vice president of human resources, with nine years of hiring experience. Those nine years have been spent hiring for sales and marketing positions. </P>





<P>Whether you're applying for a sales position or not, those facts need to sell you to an employer. And you don't have much time to make the pitch and close the deal.</P>





<P>"You get 10 seconds of my time," says Veatch. "I look to see what position you're applying for and then I look for supporting qualifications in the resume. If I don't see anything that qualifies you you go into 'the pile.'"

<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>he pile of discarded resumes has grown deep at companies over the last few years. One way to keep from landing in "the pile" is to immediately identify what you're looking for in an objective statement. </P>



<P>"You've got one chance to grab someone's attention and the objective statement has to be the most powerful statement on the resume," says Bird. "It should be crisp and clear." </P>





<P>According to Bird, someone coming straight out school should make the connection between the skills and learning acquired in school to the position they're applying for. The statement should be no longer than one sentence.</P>





<P>"Starting with the objective statement your resume should flow correctly and read like a book," says Bird. This makes it even more important to tighten up your facts and limit your "book" to only one page.</P>





<P>Organization throughout your resume is the key to explaining what you can provide to a company. The biggest negatives in a resume are always incorrect spelling, poor organization and sloppiness. "Presentation, presentation, presentation," insists Bird.</P>





<P>After the objective statement, list your employment experience. You may not have several years on the job, but positions you held in school, part-time jobs, activities you've organized and other outside-of-the-classroom experiences are extremely relevant.
</P>




<P>"I like to see an interest in the field or industry," says Richard Burke, a manager of applications development with over fours years of interviewing and hiring. The majority of Burke's experience is with computer science majors in school or recent graduates.</P>





<P>According to Burke showing outside interests proves you're really interested in your field and you're not just in school to get an education.</P>





<P>After listing your experience clearly show what responsibilities and duties you've performed. This list should be relevant to the type of position you're applying for--and make sure to use action words to describe what you've done.</P>





<P>"Some of the better ones (list of responsibilities) show a result expected from a project someone worked on," says Burke. "One or two lines, that's all it takes." </P>





<P>And if you're going to list software or equipment that you're familiar with, make sure you have a clear understanding of what is listed.</P>





<P>"Anyone can pick up PC Week and write down every buzz word that's in there," says Burke. "But after having a conversation with someone for five minutes, I can tell if they know what they're talking about."</P>





<P>Education is usually near the bottom of a resume. All that is needed is your degree, specific major and university. If you want to list a GPA, make sure it's a 3.0 or above.</P>





<P>"I'm not really interested in a GPA, especially for someone with a couple years of experience," says Burke.</P>





<P>After you send your resume in, finding out whether someone has received it is always concern. Give the company some time before you call, and be prepared to leave a message.</P>





<P>"I have to dig through resumes to find a specific one and that takes time," says Veatch.</P>





<P>Competition for entry-level jobs today is fierce. And behind that veil of secrecy is someone who will judge whether you're right for the position you're applying for, making it imperative that you build the best resume.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>P</FONT>lease, a moment of silence for another passing holiday season. Now we must
face the
same ol' New Year's resolutions: lose all the weight and debt we gained over the
holidays. Unfortunately, we must also face the continued onslaught of
holiday movie
returns delivered by Hollywood to our neighborhood movie-plexes. If only the
movie
moguls could resolve to be as creative as our financing. In their maniacal
pursuit of
blockbuster money-makers, Hollywood has once again recycled its old hits
(cast with
pretty new stars) to appeal to the MTV audiences of today. So before you
fight the
crowds at your local theater, sit back in your favorite easy chair with a
big bowl of
buttered...uh...plain popcorn and take a look at the originals.</P>
<BR>

<b>101 DALMATIONS</b>  (1961)  Animated, Color, 79 min. Don't get me wrong.
Glenn Close is over the top as Cruella De Vil in the remake, but nothing
beats the
original animated classic. Pongo and Perdita, London's most auspicious
canine couple,
set out to save the pups who've been snatched by the merciless De Vil.
Charming story
told from a dog's point of view. Songs include <i>Dalmation Plantation</i>  and
<i>Cruella De Vil</i>.</P>

<P>Other Disney Classics: The Jungle Book, Pinocchio, Snow White & the Seven
Dwarfs.</P>
<BR>

<P><b>THE BISHOP'S WIFE</b>  (1947) Cary Grant, David Niven, Loretta Young, B&W,
109 min. Who better to replace pretty boy Cary Grant than Denzel Washington
in the
new <i>Preacher's Wife</i>. In the original, Grant stars a suave angel who
comes to
Earth to help distraught young bishop, David Niven, raise money for his
cathedral in his
new parish while soothing over his wife's (Young) neglected feelings. Excellent
performances including wonderful support from Monty Wooley and James Gleason.</P>

<P>Also with Grant: Arsenic & Old Lace, Charade, North By Northwest, The
Philadelphia
Story, To Catch A Thief, An Affair To Remember.</P>
<BR>

<P><b>THE CRUCIBLE</b>  (1957) Simone Signoret, Yves Montand, Mylene Demongeot,
Foreign, B&W, 140 min. Can Winona Ryder pull off Arthur Miller's dark Salem
witch-
hunt drama? Even though Miller himself scripted the screenplay? Anyone remember
<i>Dracula</i>? Enough said. In this astounding French cinematic version
directed by
Raymond Rouleau, Signoret and Montand are brilliant as victims of savage
prejudice. Go
ahead, try it.</P>

<P>Also with Signoret: Diabolique (1954), Madame Rosa, Ship of Fools, Sleeping Car
Murders.</P>
<BR>

<P><b>INVADERS FROM MARS</b>  (1953) Helena Carter, Arthur Franz, B&W, 78 min.
No one can ever doubt the creativity and originality of Tim Burton,
especially in his
wacky new <i>Mars Attacks</i>. But I like to imagine he was inspired by some
of those
vintage campy space invasion movies. In <i>Invaders</i> a boy sees a flying
saucer
descend but nobody believes him. Soon we see the kid's paranoia is not only
fun, it's true
as aliens begin possessing his friends, family and neighbors. You'll love
the creatures and
effects. Also stars Jimmy Hunt, Leif Erickson.</P>

<P>Other Sci-Fi classics: The Day the Earth Stood Still, Invasion of the Body
Snatchers, War
of the Worlds.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT>nvesting your money in mutual funds is never easy, but now the Institute for American Values Investing  is targeting funds that they claim are "contributing to America's moral and cultural decline." According to the Institute they specialize in," identifying mutual funds that morally sensitive investors can be comfortable owning on the basis of both investment worth and moral values."</P>

The criteria used by the Institute to identify these mutual funds are based on the number of holdings each fund owns in companies that profit from or promote one or more of the following:  abortion, pornography, anti-family entertainment and companies that actively promote homosexuality. In addition, the Institute claims they also offer "the ability to add companies involved in the production of alcohol, tobacco and gambling."</P>

<P>According to the Institutes founder and president Scott Fehrenbacher, "We have spent the last two years developing software designed to identify the percentage of holdings in every stock mutual fund that is investing in and contributing to the moral decay of our culture."</P>

<P>Some of the funds targeted by the Institute include: </P>

<UL>
<P><LI>The Janus Fund, the nation's 11th largest mutual fund, which "has over $70 million invested directly in the company responsible
for RU-486, the spontaneous abortion pill."</P>

<P><LI>The AmCap fund, which "invests in the producer of the Howard Stern show." </P>

<P><LI>Investment Company of America, "with over $155 million invested in the owner of the pornographic 'gansta' rap Interscope Records label."</P>

<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Bill Thornbro</A></P>


<P>You don't need sub-zero temperatures or six feet of snow to ruin travel plans. Old Man Winter can do plenty of damage with a little ice and freezing rain, making even the straight line from point A to point B a difficult proposition. Getting to work in some of the worst winter weather can require the patience of Job and the nerves of Indiana Jones.</P>

<P>There are a few steps you can take to make sure you and your car make it safely into March and April. Properly winterized, your car should survive the winter just fine. Of course, a lot of people make the <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/sept/carsncash/glue/glue1.html">annual tune-up</A> an autumn ritual, which goes a long way toward beating winter back. Among the items checked during a typical tune-up is coolant, and if you've been topped off with the proper coolant, you should have protection down around -35 degrees F.</P>

<P>"There's a reason they call it antifreeze," says mechanic Chad Howell. Chad and his brother Derek, who also is a mechanic, own their own garage. "Use a 50-50 mix of water and antifreeze in the winter, 'cause you get too much water in there and it freezes and cracks the radiator or engine." When in doubt, always check your owner's manual, he adds.</P>

<P>Another essential liquid: windshield washer fluid. "You don't think about it--I don't. When all that snow gets black and slushy, though, and those trucks start kicking that (slush) on your windshield, you'll be plenty glad you've got it," says Howell. "Don't fill it all the way full during the winter. Maybe three-quarters of the way full. That way it can naturally expand without doing any damage."</P>

<P>Don't neglect the windshield wipers. Snow and ice reduce visibility as much as any hard rain. "I know I get up in the morning and scrap a patch on the windshield big enough to see and that's it. I'm like anybody else. I start the truck and turn on the wipers and it goes 'ggrrrrr' 'cause the wipers are frozen to the windshield. That makes the motor work harder and it can blow, so you ought to clear ice away from the wipers before you turn 'em on," says Howell.</P>

<P>Howell says he hasn't used snow <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/june/carsncash/glue/glue.html">tires</A> in years. "The tires I've seen with all-season tread are as good as it gets, and they'll get you most places old snow tires did. If they don't, you probably ought to be staying home anyway." When it comes to snow chains, state and local laws differ, he adds, so check with authorities before buying them.</P>

<P>Mechanic Tony Patterson says there's more to winterizing than checking the antifreeze. He says he you should be packing your trunk with stuff designed to keep you alive in the event you get stuck out in the boonies. Here's a short list of Patterson's items. Feel free to add to it.</P>

<UL>
<P><LI><B>Snow shovel.</B></P>

<P><LI><B>Jumper cables.</B></P>

<P><LI><B>Flares.</B> They should be in your trunk anyway.</P>

<P><LI><B>First-aid kit.</B> See above.</P>

<P><LI><B>Ice scraper.</B> It sounds crazy, but you'd be surprised how many people rely on their defrosters alone.</P>

<P><LI><B>Flashlight.</B> Try changing a flat without one at night in six inches of snow.</P>

<P><LI><B>Blanket.</B> Maybe two. Keep one in the trunk, the other in the backseat.</P>

<P><LI><B>Cardboard.</B> or a large sheet of plastic in case you have to get on the ground to do any repairs.</P>

<P><LI><B>Gloves.</B> An extra pair in the trunk wouldn't hurt. While we're at it, throw in an extra sweatshirt, a knit stocking cap and some clean socks. Keep them dry in a plastic bag.</P>



<P><LI><B>Munchies.</B> Throw a few packs of cheese-and-peanut butter crackers--or whatever you like--in a Tupperware container and stash it in the trunk. </P>

<FONT SIZE=4>I</FONT>t seems that sex is getting more and more complicated. Not the act itself--that remains fairly elementary. But with all the hullabaloo that goes with sex these days, you practically have to dip yourself in iodine, shield yourself with 15 layers of flame-retardant, slip-proof latex and have a dialysis machine on standby just to engage in heavy petting. Not to mention the stress of pleasing your partner, avoiding pregnancy or shouting out the name of  the third-grade teacher you had a crush on. </P>

<P>To top it all off, it seems at one time or another we've probably broken the law doing it. </P>

<P>Most of us assume that we know what's legal and what's not. After all, if it hasn't been on a talk show, it's gotta be fair game, right? Not so. There are a lot of sex laws on record that are highly specific, woefully unforgiving and, well, downright loony. </P>

<P>Just ask Robert Wayne Pelton. Better yet, read his collection of the before mentioned loony sex laws cleverly titled <I>Loony Sex Laws That You Never Knew You Were Breaking</I>. There are some wonderful morsels of judicial folly in this fine literary specimen. Perhaps Clinton never inhaled, but the judiciary branch of our government (well, state, city and county) seems to have left a legacy of reefer madness. </P>

<P>For instance, if you've ever had a fantasy about having sex in a toll booth on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, you'll want to keep that strictly a fantasy--it's illegal according to authorities in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. And if you're planning on some Nebraska-style hanky-panky, get your condoms before you cross the state line. It's not that they don't have condoms in Nebraska, it's just a little difficult to get them. According to Nebraska law, only doctors are allowed to dispense condoms (makes casual sex a little more formal, eh?). To married couples in Willowdale, Oregon, "safe sex" means more than a simple prophylactic. There, a husband breaks the law if he swears in the heat of the moment. His wife, however, may legally whisper the very same profanities in his ear. </P>

<P>Now we all know how exciting it is when both parties in the lovemaking process express their ultimate satisfaction. But men, please, try to contain your excitement if you're in Connersville, Wisconsin. There it is illegal for the you to shoot a gun into the air when you've caused a female to have an orgasm. If you feel the need to punctuate the experience, please use fireworks.</P>

<P>These laws are funny. Ha ha. They're a good joke at the office. And we can laugh at them because they're too specific and outrageous to spark even a hint of fear in us. Should they? If someone asked you to have sex in a toll booth on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, are you gonna turn them down? The good news is, if you decide to go for it (who wouldn't?), chances are you'll be OK. </P>

<P>David Papke, a professor of law at Indiana School of Law at Indianapolis, says that 99.9 percent of these laws are, in essence, dead. "There's always a chance a law like that could be upheld, but they're really not real life problems anymore," says Papke. The reason these laws seem so ridiculous is that they're just plain out of date. "Laws are a product of culture, politics and concerns of the era. Many of these laws are a reaction to a behavior at the time. They all deal with sexual norms and conduct. Then it wasn't inappropriate to legislate morality. But now it just looks silly." It also probably helps to know that you'd find Pelton's book in the humor section. Chances are if these laws were recently upheld, the contents would be considered a little more controversial. "Laws are interesting windows on time and culture. Pelton's book simply provides you a window to another time," adds Papke. </P>

<P>So why are the laws even on record? Like many things in this world, it all comes down to limited time. "There is no systematic, automatic way to strike these laws from record. Lawmakers have limited time, so they often just can't get to the task of reviewing laws like these," says Papke. </P>

<P>While it's probably true that the sexual no-nos of yesteryear will dog us forever, it doesn't look like any of us have to alter our behavior much. So relax. Feel free to shoot that gun. Just watch where you point it. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>P</FONT>oints on your drivers license are more like stains on a favorite shirt. Get
one stain on a
shirt and at least you can wear it with a sweater. Get another stain and you
can always
wear it while you work in the yard or garage. Get enough stains on the
shirt, however,
and it has to be pitched.</P>

<P>Get enough points and your license gets pitched.</P>

<P>Points are a way of measuring bad driving records. Run a red light, fail to
make a
complete stop, drive 45 mph in a 30 mph zone, hit a grandmother. These
things'll get you
points. How many points you get before your permission to drive is revoked
depends on
the state in which you live, but it doesn't take many.</P>

<P>"Some states don't have a point system at all," says Sgt. A. Philip Roysden.
"Different
offenses rate different points, but that's not a decision we make. And we
don't decide
what it takes to get suspended. A felony DUI might be a year's suspension, but a
misdemeanor DUI may be six months."</P>

<P>And suddenly you wish you hadn't breezed through that stop sign. You're
sorry you didn't
wear your safety belt. You wish you hadn't plowed into store window. You
wish these
things because you're now reduced to bumming rides from buddies or riding
your 10-
speed to work in the January snow. Your pride and joy, that beautiful
fendered friend is
sitting in your driveway and all you can do is sit behind the wheel and
pretend--just like
you did when you were 10 years old.</P>

<P>Can they be erased. "With time," he says. "And sometimes there are programs
you can
take to have them reduced." Again, that might differ from state to state.</P>

<P>"There are circumstances where you can be issued a hardship license," says
Roysden.
"Like if you're the sole provider for your family, the only one who drives
and you need
the car to get to work. Something like that."</P>

<P>Sgt. Roysden has crystal-blue eyes and a muscular neck that strains at his
collar. He looks
the part. Officer Authority. You can almost hear him say the magic words:
"License and registration,
please."</P>

<P>"Losing your license is a real eye-opener," says the sarge with a smile. "I
don't know a lot
of people who lost their license and continued to drive like maniacs. Most
people learn
their lesson real, real fast."</P>

<P>"We get a lot of e-mail from people saying, 'Why aren't there any jobs for people like me?' That's because companies don't think you're on the Internet yet," says Moore. But using the Internet to reach an employer does give you an advantage.</P>





<P>"You get the reputation as forward thinking if you are responding to an ad on the Web," says Hatelevig.  Even though you may get a reputation as forward thinking, you might not fit the complete profile of applicants a company needs. Because even as the demographics of the Internet change, many companies will still only use the Internet to advertise a portion of their openings.</P>





<P><IMG WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=240 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="Computer.gif">"One of the dangers of the Internet is that (employers) don't draw from a diverse pool because the Internet can be anything but diverse," says Lawrence. "You don't want to get just white male candidates." </P>





<P>As companies wrestle with concerns over solely using the Internet as a recruiting tool, there are considerations that the job seeker should keep in mind. If you are currently employed and looking for a job, do you want your current employer discovering your desire to leave?</P>





<P>"Individuals are entitled to build a career," says Moore. "But you need to make an active decision on whether you want to place your resume on an open or secure site." While CareerMosaic is an open site, CareerSite and Career Magazine are secure. </P>





<P>An open site allows an employer to search through and know the name and address of a person they are considering for an opening. But a secure site will list your skills, experience, salary desired, location and responsibilities without divulging who you are. "People want to be findable, but they don't want to be identifiable," says Laub. "And that's especially true if you already have a job."</P>





<P>But according to Laub, "there's no way to advertise yourself if you don't want to tell people who you are." By the very nature of placing your personal information online, you are becoming a record in someone's database. Your record may be deleted after 30 or 90 days, but finding a job requires that you are advertise your skills to a potential employer.</P>





<P>Another concern for job seekers using the Internet is trolling. According to Gary Resnikoff, president of Career Magazine, trolling is when a recruiter or company places an ad for a position that may or may not be open, using general terms in hopes of building their database of resumes. </P>





<P>But the trail the Internet leads you down when searching for a job is extremely benficial. "You can already be there when the jobs come in and you don't have to buy every newspaper to find a job," says Laub.</P>

<P>As you explore page after page in the newspaper looking for a job, the ink stains left on your hands leave a trail on your coffee mug, pen and notepad. But where that trail leads you is not always the path to employment.</P>





<P>The traditional paper-chase job search is quickly giving way to the digital-job search for employers and employees. 
But according to Rick Laub, vice president of sales at CareerSite, "Everything sounds great until you try to do something." That's because winding your way through the electronic maze of online employment ads can prove to be frustrating unless you're aware of what makes an employer want to hire you. </P>





<P>According to Barry Lawrence, a spokesperson for the Society for Human Resource Management, creating your resume for the Internet has little to do with looks and everything to do with the skills you list. Your skills essentially become keywords for an employer when they search for candidates. And an employer searching for a candidate on the Internet is much like the way you use search engines: an employer enters certain keywords and hopes for the highest possible match. This makes it all too important to <A HREF="/sept/work/resume/resume1.html">build a better resume</A> than your competition.</P>





<P>But even though employers are using the Internet as a recruiting tool, many are still waiting for applicants to contact them. "The person seeking the job has to seek the employer out," says Troy Hatelevig, online editor at HR Headquarters. "They (companies) post openings and let employees contact them."</P>





<P>And even when you do find an employer you're interested in contacting, the Internet differs radically from traditional job hunting methods. "A lot of companies don't have the backend processes to handle the resumes they get and sometimes you can get lost in the cracks," says Hatelevig. But the rise in sites that cater to companies and job seekers seeking a make a match is changing that problem.</P>





<P>At CareerSite, according to Laub, they attempt to match an employer with a candidate using what they call their Virtual Agent Search. Twice a week CareerSite combs through all of their job openings and their candidates, and after matching them, they alert the candidate to the open position. As Laub explains, "That way you don't have to be out there searching all the time."</P>





<P>Though searching for employment using the Internet is not unlike using any other method in one respect, there are always more candidates than there are jobs, and CareerSite has about 15 job seekers for every one opening. Your edge over other job seekers in the digital job hunt is to have as much information as you can about a company, and many job databases are helping give you that edge. </P>

 



<P>"We think it's important for applicants to choose companies not openings," says Bruce Moore, vice president of systems and planning at CareerMosaic. Moore explains that CareerMosaic tries to help companies brand themselves as an employer by providing information on what a company does, who their partners are, their mission statement and financial commitment. </P>





<P>Where the benefits really lie for job seekers using the Internet are in companies that know you are out there. "Companies are aware that people in college are on the Internet." says Lawrence.  But, he adds, most of those companies are usually high-tech or banking firms, and a lot of companies that may have the dream job you're looking for might not be using the Internet to find you. </P>

<P><b>

Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah,
Washington and Wyoming. Also Alaska and Hawaii.</b></P>

<P><IMG WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=37 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="wcap.gif" ALT="W">esterns used to be about cowboys. Today's West is about computers. From
Silicone
Valley to Bill Gate's pretty new house, this area is about motherboards and
modems.
Computer engineers, programmers, software developers, system specialists and
Webmasters will all be hot commodities in 1997. It's not enough to be able
to work on a
computer, however; you will need to know it inside and out. That's how
fierce the
competition is for good high-tech jobs in this region. And it will only get
more intense as
companies battle it out for that extra percent of market share. Good
networking is crucial.</P>

<P>That's the bad news. The good news is most companies will pay you well for
your ulcer.</P>

<P>The defense industry is cold right now. Service-related work is not. The
service sector
does take on a different look in a part of the country that includes Las
Vegas glitter and
Los Angeles glare. Every waitress is a budding actress and every pizza
delivery boy is a
promising actor. But the gaming and entertainment industries are always on
the lookout
for new talent, and we don't mean pretty faces. Software developers,
computer artists and
animators, systems analysts and--this is really interesting--security people
are all needed.
And you don't need an agent to get an audition.</P>

<P>Landscaping will be hot this year. Small corporations in cities and deserts
want to look as
nice as their bigger brothers, said one business professor. And keep an eye
on small
businesses in general, said another. Not only will they be hiring grads in
bigger numbers,
but young people are learning that smaller companies may not have the
prestige or big
salaries, but the opportunities for advancement are twice as good. Those
same smaller
businesses need personnel help. Call the human resource department.</P>

<P>Unemployment around here is awful. New Mexico's jobless rate is more than 6
percent
while Alaska is more than 7 percent and California's is nearly 8 percent. Most
government agencies and a number of non-profit organizations won't be hiring
much in
1997. But hiring in big numbers will be tourism-related companies in
California, Hawaii
and--are you listening?--Alaska. Cruises to Alaska are very popular and not
just among
retirees. Tourism will always be big here. Tourists generated more than $10
billion in
Hawaii, more than $55 billion in California.</P>

<P>An economist suggested that young marketers and advertising specialists
could always
expect top dollar in this region because businesses know the value of
"sizzle on the
steak." But another professor disagreed, saying "silver-tongued" salesmen
were a dime a
dozen out here." Either way, the jobs are there. Send a resume.</P>

<P>Communications majors can do worse that going West. Consider this: San
Francisco has
14 TV stations and 35 radio stations. San Diego has 8 TV stations and 22
radio stations.
Poor San Bernardino only has 5 TV stations. What do they do for entertainment?</P>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>Goodman:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP><P>Before you invest anywhere you have to understand what
you're
investing in. Most people spend too little time learning, and they just go
ahead and buy things on hot tips, or "my uncle says it's good" or "it
sounded good." They really don't understand what they're involved in, they
don't understand the risks, and then they don't understand why it went
right or it went wrong.</P>

<P>So invest in knowledge first and then invest in things later. Understand
about individual stocks, about mutual funds about bonds, the basics of
these things.</P>

<P>My experience is (the basics are) not being taught in schools at all. They
teach economics in very abstract (terms). They've got all kinds of theories
in calculus and charts and graphs, but it's not buying stocks and bonds,
and personal finances at all. So, that's the first thing to understand.</P>

<P>The second thing is to set up a disciplined investing system. You have to
do what I call <I>actual savings</I>  as opposed to <I>wishful savings</I>,
"When I pay off my credit card bills, when my student loans are paid off,
when something in the future happens then I'll start saving." I don't go
for any of that, because it doesn't happen. You have to set it up
automatically. And I recommend things where you can do an automatic $50,
$100 right out of your paycheck automatically, or your checking account,
whatever it may be.</P>

<P>Some specific things I like, for example, is something called the Stein  Roe
young investor's fund. It's perfect for this audience. One-hundred dollar
minimum, so you don't have to have thousands of dollars. It has had a
return of about 40 percent a year. Great returns.</P>

<P>The literature that goes with it is designed for young people in several
ways. First of all, the stocks they buy young people can relate to: Nike,
Disney, Coca-Cola, Hasbro, Toys 'R Us. And all the literature is designed
in very plain language, they've even got comic books.</P>

<P>Because, I find a lot people just intimidated by the language of finance.
It's like a whole new world and they don't even know how to
get started. So this is something that gives them a little bit of a head
start. And gives them a low-minimum, no-commission, no-load fund.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>ENTER:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>But do you think it's realistic for a new investor that's
going to
invest a small amount of money to think that they're going to get a large
return within a short period of time?
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>Goodman:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP><P>Well, I mean it can be done. There's a definite trade-off
between
risk and return. The higher risk you're going to take, over the long run,
the higher return you're going to get.  The short term it might not work
out that way.</P>

<P>The stock market has been incredibly robust right now. One of the reasons
is, people are putting money into the market because they're willing to
take more risk to get higher returns.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>ENTER:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>Do you think that the stock market is overvalued right now?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>Goodman:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>No.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>ENTER:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>So it would still be a safe bet to invest in the stock market?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>Goodman:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>I wouldn't use the word safe. I would say prudent. Safe
means
you're not going to lose money. You could definitely lose money. But it's
prudent in that's where you're going to make money long term. </TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP><P><!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=46 ALT="T"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tdrop.gif">he winners in society today are the owners, not the workers. So to become
a winner, become an owner. You become an owner by buying stocks, mutual
funds, participating in 401(k), profit sharing, volume business, that's
where you're gonna make money. You're never gonna get rich from your
salary, unless you're Shaquille O'Neal.</P>

<P>People think somehow they're gonna go along, earning two-to-three percent
on their passbook account, paying 18 percent on their credit cards, and
their student loans at 13 percent, and somehow they'll get ahead. It's not
gonna work.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>ENTER:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>Then how do you stop the downward spiral created by heavy debt
from credit cards and student loans?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>Goodman:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP><P>It does (become a downward spiral). You get into the wrong
habits,
and this is what I call the "Negative Compounding Spiral." You've got
interest piling up against you all the time from high credit cards. Your
savings are earning almost nothing, and you're getting further behind all
the time.</P>

<P>There's several ways (to get out of the Negative Compounding Spiral). First
of all, you lower the credit card interest from 18 percent down to eight
percent. Surf on down from ridiculously high rates to decent rates.</P>

<P><IMG WIDTH=324 HEIGHT=108 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="moneyquote1.gif">The second thing is to get a higher yield from your savings. You can get a
short-term-bond fund today, no-load fund, no-commission and seven or eight
percent yield, compared to two or three percent on your passbook account.
So you double, or more than double your income, and cut your credit cards
in half. And you're already on the road to getting a good start.</P>

<P>That's the financial part; there's also a psychological part. The more you
invest your time, your effort, your mind into personal finance, the more
return you get.</P>

<P>A lot of people are ruled by inertia, apathy and lack of knowledge. They
don't do anything. Life just kinda bumbles along and they don't know what
they're doing. They end up 50, they have nothing saved, they've got credit
card bills, they still haven't paid off their student loans. They're a
mess. They got into the wrong habits.</P>

<P>So (people in their 20s) are in a particularly great situation to get
into the right habits. It makes a big difference down the road.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>ENTER:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>If you're not an owner and you're not an entrepreneur, and you
are
stuck in that downward spiral of heavy debt, and you want to try and make
money, are there other ways to pull yourself out of this Negative
Compounding Spiral?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>Goodman:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP><P>There are dividend reinvestment plans if you buy stock.
There's
something called first share. First share is where you can buy one share of
stock with no commission. For the average person they can get into about
300 Blue Chip companies, and you can buy one share and enroll in a dividend
reinvestment plan. The dividends are reinvested by buying you more shares
automatically.</P>

<P>Even better than that are what are called "Discount Dividend Reinvestment"
plans. Where they give you a discount on reinvested dividends. Typically,
it is five percent. You give them $100 in dividends and they
give you $105 worth of stock. It's called free money.</P>

<P>You see my first principal of finance is never refuse free money. And let's
hope you don't do that too often. This is an example of it, "Discount
Dividend Reinvestment."</P>

<P>Another example is 401(k)s. If you start a job and they give you a 401(k),
I don't care how little you're making, take them up even if they don't
match you. It's nice if they match you, let's hope that they do; if they
do, for sure take them up on the amount up to the match. Up to six percent
of the salary, whatever it may be.</P>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>ENTER:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>Even if you're not going to be vested?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>Goodman:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>Even if you're not going to be vested. With 401(k) you're
always
vested with what you contribute. What you may not be vested in is the
company's contribution, but hopefully you'll be there long enough to get
that (the employers contribution) vested. But this is an automatic savings
plan that'll work for you, because it comes right out of your check and you
wont even notice it's gone. It's growing tax-deferred. It's a good idea.

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP><P><!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=46 ALT="I" SRC="idrop.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>f you're in geology, see what's happening with oil companies. Use the field
you're in to look at what's going on around you. I do a lot of radio shows
and I'm at radio stations all the time. I said "these guys are going to get
taken over here." And I've made a lot of money on radio stocks.</P>

<P>Keep your ears open and your eyes open. This is Peter Lynch's style--don't
buy exotic, weird technology things that you don't know what they're doing.
Buy stuff you can relate to and understand.</P>

<P>In many cases there's opportunities all around you. In what you shop for
and what your colleges (shop for).</P>

<P>Another way is to form an investment club. Where you get a diverse group of
people who have all kinds of ideas of what is going on. It's a good way of
beating different kinds of ideas back and forth.</P>
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>ENTER:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>For example, you're saying that you can find investments by
buying a
tie from the Gap and saying, "Hey, the Gap might be a good, safe
investment."</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>Goodman:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>Right, but I wouldn't emphasize safe. I would emphasize the
returns part. Safety means you can't lose your principal, which means you
can't make any money.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>ENTER:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP> When you're young and you're trying to get out of debt, do you
think
it's better to go with higher-risk investments?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>Goodman:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP><P>Absolutely. One of the biggest mistakes younger people make
is
taking too little risk on their investments. They're in passbook accounts.
They're taking no risk.</P>

<P><!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=324 HEIGHT=89 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="moneyquote2.gif">And they say to me all the time, "I've only got a $1000, I can't afford to
lose it." And I say, "You've only got a $1000, you have nothing to lose."</P>

<P>You're giving away all the potential upside of having it invested in a hot
technology company or mutual funds. You don't care if you need the money in
a year, you <I>need</I> it in 30 years. In 30 years is Microsoft going to
be higher or lower than it is today? Is an aggressive growth fund going to
be higher or lower than it is today? It's going to be 10 times what it is
today. A passbook account is just not going to make it, or a CD,
money-market fund or savings bond.</P>

<P>I talk about the investment pyramid of risk. The top of the pyramid being
aggressive
stuff, the middle being equity income: it has growth and income
and the bottom being the safe stuff. Most young people have it at the
bottom of the pyramid and they should have it all at the top. Because they
should make use of the greatest asset they have, which is time. Time on
their side to make the money grow.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>ENTER:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>Even if you don't have a lot of money to invest?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>Goodman:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP><P>Particularly if you don't have a lot money to invest.
Because
you're not losing anything, but you're giving up all the potential upside.</P>

<P>The more nervous it makes you to be risky, the better it is because it
means you'll pay more attention to it. Again, the more your mind is
involved with this--if your money is on line, if you're actually watching
stocks and mutual funds and your mind is involved with it--the better
returns than if you're just passive, inert and apathetic, the way most
people are about their personal finances.</P>

<P>Here's a thing that's in their greatest self interest, but they take the
least amount of time and effort. It's crazy. The line I like to say is,
"People spend 99-and-a-half percent of their time making their employers
rich and less than half-of-one percent on themselves." You watch your
employers money very carefully, and you're really careful at work, but you
don't use the same skills on yourself. I'm not sure why this is true but
it is.</P>
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>ENTER:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>Do you think IPOs are something people in their early or
middle
20s should look at investing in?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>Goodman:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>Most people in your crowd can't get into IPOs. Because you
have to
be a really good customer. If it's a hot IPO, if it's a Planet Hollywood or
some other hot IPO the people who get those shares are the good customers
that have been around for a long time. Those people [good customers] have a
lot more money, good relationships with brokers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>ENTER:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP>How do key economic indicators, like the unemployment rates 
have risen or fallen, relate to the stock market? Are they something that
someone should pay attention to?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><PRE> </PRE></TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=60 VALIGN=TOP><B>Goodman:</B></TD><TD WIDTH=450 VALIGN=TOP><P>To some extent they do affect it. They affect psychology. In
general, when unemployment is falling it means the economy is growing, but
there's more fear that inflation and interest rates may go up.</P>

<P>But you can get too caught up in the government economic numbers-statistics
mill. It can drive you crazy. You shouldn't be investing on "inflation's
up but unemployment is down," and all this day-to-day stuff. Buy good
companies or good mutual funds and you'll do fine.</P>

<P>A lot of companies are really unrelated to the economy and can do extremely
well. Two companies on the New York Stock Exchange: Corrections Corporation of
America and Wackenhut Corrections Corporation. They are privatizing prisons
throughout the country. Unlimited demand for their services, because
prisons are wildly overcrowded and will always be wildly overcrowded. They
can do it cheaper and better than local, state or federal. They're doing
all of them.</P>

<P>Prison agencies. They treat the prisoners better and they come out better.
It's far cheaper,
the facilities are nicer and they do a great job. These company's earnings
are rising like
100 percent a year. Unrelated to the economy, because the government can save
money.</P>

<P>I've got loads of examples, but that's an example of something unrelated to
the economy. I don't care if employment's up or down or interest rates,
here's companies that are doing good stuff.</P></TD></TR>

<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/tellus.html">By Andrew Vitale</A></P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="prescap.gif" ALT="I">t's tough to just get by paycheck to paycheck. You work hard, put in long
days, rise to the challenge and you may even save the company some
money. So now it's time to put some comfort in your lifestyle by putting
more dead presidents in your paycheck with a raise. But before you step
into your boss' office and demand to be paid more, there are several
things you must do to make the right approach and get the money you want.</P>

<P>According to Jack Milligan, a career management consultant with 27 years of
experience as a human resource professional, the raise process begins with the
expectations you were hired under. "Make certain the terms and conditions
of your employment are very well stated on the front end," says Milligan.
If you have a clearly defined role and objectives from the first day you
started working, then you should also know when you'll have your first
review and you can seize the opportunity to ask for more money at that
review.</P>

<P>Andrew Ludlow, a spokesperson for the Society of Human Resource Management,
agrees your "evaluation would be a good time for that (asking for a
raise)."</P>

<P>According to Milligan, "Coming into an organization you have an opportunity to say something like, 'I see that the standard review process
for new employees is to give a probationary review after 90 days, and then
an actual performance review after one year. Would it be possible if I
could hit the ground running and demonstrate my abilities and have my first
economic review in six months rather than a year."</P>

<P>If you didn't ask for your review date to happen sooner than
planned before you started your job--and now you feel like you deserve more
money but it's only been three months--you need to be very careful. "They've
just hired you for X amount of dollars, and that's what they wanted to pay
you to start, and if you walk right in and ask for a raise immediately I
wouldn't exactly advise on that," says Ludlow.</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="presquote.gif">If you already started working and didn't ask for a economic review date up
front, or even if you did, the first step is creating what Milligan
calls an "audit trail of justification." Your audit trail of justification
is a file or folder that you keep that details a time-specific record of
the good things you have done in your role. According to Milligan, after
several months of employment you have a permanent record of your
value-added incidents and accomplishments. "If you're gonna ask to be
higher paid, you have to create higher value," says Mulligan.</P>

<P>To create a great audit trail you'll have to keep track on a daily basis
when you reach certain milestones, when you turn in reports, when you've
made decisions and when you've had victories on the job. Because even
though you remember that you've accomplished great things, according to
Milligan, "the vast majority of those (accomplishments) in American business
tend to get celebrated and forgotten. Sometimes they're not even get
celebrated."</P>

<P>Also, before you can face your boss and ask for a raise you have to know
what you are worth in your current role. Milligan says there are
two parts to your worth: the internal and external dimension. The internal
dimension of your value is dictated by the salary range of the job you
have within your organization. If you're at the low-end side of the
range, "your requests for more money are going to fall on more sympathetic
ears then if you're high in the range," says Milligan. And you also need to
know your external dimension, which is what your current role is worth
based on the job market in your region of the country.</P>

<P>The last step before you even utter the words "more money," is you'll need
to know what your limits are according to Milligan. You can set your limits
by taking the salary you were hired at and plan that you want to be making
so much more money at your first review, and then another additional amount
at your second review. If you don't get what you feel you're worth then you
need to decide whether you should bail out of the company.
</P>
<P>And Ludlow agrees; you need to assess the fact of what you mean to the
company you work for and if they cannot pay you what you feel you're worth
then you may want leave. "You make the personal decision, 'Do I stick
around and wait till they (the company) have money, or do I look elsewhere
for another job that's paying me what I deserve?'"</P>

<P>Now that you're prepared with the proper tools to ask for a raise you can
pop the question. According to Milligan, you need to present what you feel
you are worth and ask for more money, don't request more money. You want to
avoid giving your boss an ultimatum by saying, "Give me this or else." By
avoiding the ultimatum situation you can keep things from becoming
polarized, and according to Milligan, "even if the answer coming back is no
you will not put your job in jeopardy."</P>

Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas,
Virginia,
West Virginia.</b></P>

<P><IMG WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=37 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tcap.gif" ALT="T">heme parks aren't the only reason to come down here. If you've got your
heart set on a
career in human resources, health care, transportation, banking or
computers, come for
the sun but stay for the job. Pick the right job, though, or you'll find
yourself in the
South's ashtray.</P>

<P>From Churchill Downs in Louisville to the dog tracks in Florida, gambling is
big. And
riverboat gambling hasn't been this popular since the days of Mark Twain.
It's all part of a
thriving tourism industry in the South, an industry that includes Disney
World, the
Alamo, charming Civil War museums, Universal Studios and the French Quarter.
Tourism generates more than $30 <i>billion</i>  every year in Florida
alone--and it
shows no sign of slowing down. The career opportunities are incredible.
Every possible
career you'd find in a city like Atlanta or Houston, you'll find in the
Magic Kingdom.
Computer programmer? Apply here. Accounting major? Send your resume. Into
state-of-
the-art animation? Come on down. Want to manage a restaurant? Let's talk.</P>

<P>According to a survey of businesses by the National Association of Colleges and
Employers, Southern firms may hire nearly 30 percent more fresh college
graduates in
1997. </P>

<P>Depending on their politics and ability to network, political science
enthusiasts can find
work in Washington, D.C.--which people forget is a <i>Southern</i> city--but
it won't be
easy. As promised, government is finally shrinking and hiring has slowed to
a snail's
pace. There are still jobs available in the communications industry, but the
most recent
growth has been in the service industry. The aveage per capita income is
great at
$32,274. But the average salary for a federal worker is more than $52,000, which
explains why so many fight tooth and toenail to protect their turf.</P>

<P>Once dismissed as "snowbirds" and ridiculed for their white shoes and
matching belts,
retirees, particularly those who transplant to subtropical Florida, are
largely responsible
for the growth of the health-care industry. Specialists are in demand,
naturally, but
medical assistants of all sorts are wanted. Nurses and physical therapists
are in demand.</P>

<P>Atlanta, of course, has led the way in the South's amazing renaissance over
the last two
decades. But Orlando, Louisville, Houston, Dallas, Charlotte and a half
dozen smaller
cities have all played a part in the rebirth of the South. And new jobs
require deeper
personnel departments. Human resource people take notice.</P>

<P>Sadly, economic growth has never been spread evenly in this region, and the
result is
unemployment rates well below the national average in states like Georgia,
Virginia and
North Carolina while states like Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia suffer
staggering joblessness. Furthermore, salaries in many states are nothing to
write home
about. While Florida's per capita income is nearly $23,000, Mississsippi's
per capita
income is barely $16,500. Of the 15 states in the region, eight have per
capita incomes
below $19,000, and three are below $18,000.</P>

<P>To add to the South's misery, if the Food and Drug Administration has its
way in the next
four years, King Tobacco may go up in smoke. Choking the cigarette makers would
throw thousands of people out of work, and the loss of their buying power is
hard to
measure. It would be a loss felt by several businesses--manufacturers and
retailers and service-related companies--and many of them could be as far
removed from tobacco as you
can get.</P>

<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Bill Thornbro</A></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=4>Y</FONT>ou read about bad bosses all the time. You read about CEOs with stainless-steel hearts, crocodiles who make millions while laying off thousands of workers who struggle at $15 an hour. You read about the inflated salaries and bonuses and stock options, cold rewards for micromismanagement and malfeasance.</P>

<P>You read about professional downsizers who sign seven-figure book deals and brag about their corporate kills, and it doesn't matter that the blood on the floor comes from decent people, good workers paying for decisions made by empty suits in dirty boardrooms. You read about stupidity and greed and it makes you sick.</P>

<P>Now read about Aaron Feuerstein.</P>

<P>Feuerstein is the CEO of Malden Mills, a textile company in Lawrence, Mass. A fire in December 1995 almost destroyed the family business, and even some employees thought the 70-year-old Feuerstein should pocket the insurance money and call it quits. But he couldn't do that to his 3,000 workers. Many of them had stuck with Malden Mills during lean years for the company and the textile industry. Their hard work had made Feuerstein a wealthy man. He would not forget them. He could not abandon them.</P>

<P>While parts of the plant still smoldered, Feuerstein announced he would rebuild. He said he'd keep all his workers on the payroll for one month. The paychecks carried them through an otherwise bleak Christmas, and it would have been foolish to expect more. But Feuerstein extended his offer another month in January. He did it again in February. It was generosity that would ultimately cost millions of dollars--and win for him respect, admiration and love from his employees and a glowing profile on <I>60 Minutes</I>.</P>

<P>Workers--blue collar and white, union and management--hung in there. Inspired by their leader, employees pulled together and had some machines running in less than two weeks.</P>

<P>Nearly all of Malden Mills' employees are now back on the job and working harder than ever. For the ones that haven't been called back--fewer than 500--Feuerstein guarentees their old jobs will be waiting for them when the new plant opens next year. In the meantime, he extended their health benefits. </P>

<P>A number of things set Feuerstein apart from his contemporaries in American business but two of the most obvious characteristics are heart and humanity. While other companies contribute to a few local charities and move on, their good deeds complete, Feuerstein makes real contributions to his community simply by caring about the people who work under him.</P>

<P>There are other bosses out there like Aaron Feuerstein. Seek them out. Send them resumes. If you're lucky enough to get hired by one of them, support them with your hard work. And when you become a boss, please be like Aaron Feuerstein.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><IMG WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=72 ALT="A" SRC="saldropcap.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>mong printed material available on average salaries, a quarterly survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers is an excellent resource--and prominently mentioned in an earlier salary story published in ENTER. Ludlow cites the Bureau of Labor Statistics and magazines like <I>Money</I>  and <I>Fortune</I>. Both Ludlow and Hardin suggested professional or trade publications. And there are several books on the subject, of course, including <I>The Princeton Review Guide To Your Career</I>  (Random House), which lists average starting salaries, salaries after five years and salaries after 10- 15 years for more than 150 different jobs.</P>





<P>Whatever source you're using, Hardin recommends looking up the annual cost of living index at the local library. "That will let you make some adjustments in the average salary," she says.
</P>




<P>Be prepared to make adjustments anyway; salary surveys can vary widely. "If it's a national average, that's where people get in trouble, because it can be a pretty large swing (up or down)," says Hardin. "Say a mechanical engineer knows the average salary and goes for a job in Buffalo and finds out it's on the low end. A friend could be making $20,000 a year or more as a mechanical engineer in Washington, D.C. or New York City."</P>



<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG WIDTH=324 HEIGHT=118  SRC="salaryquote.gif"></P>



<P>Ludlow agrees. National averages "aren't going to apply satistically to Washington, D.C.," he says. "If you're comparing Louisville, Ky. to New York City, the gap is going to be significant."</P>





<P>Like campaign polls that measure the popularity of a political candidate, there should be a "plus-or-minus" factor in salary surveys, but neither HR professional could say exactly what that figure might be. Their best advice: Go with regional salary surveys whenever possible. A quick search on the Web turned up several regional and state surveys, including some surveys of jobs in cities as small as Harrisburg, Pa.</P>





<P>"Make sure your data is held to the highest credible standard," says Ludlow. "The reliability factor should be high as well."</P>





<P>Many salary surveys don't include the many benefits (health insurance) or intangibles (computer training) that increase the total compensation package. "Just knowing what somebody makes isn't all black and white," says Hardin. "It pays to know the business strategy of the company, see if the company has profit sharing or bonuses that might boost a salary."</P>





<P>"If a company offers a strong benefit package but less money I think you would have to ask what's more important to you?" asks Ludlow. "I don't think that applies just to fresh college grads. I think that applies to anyone."</P>





<P>So, Andrew Ludlow, are <I>you</I> making enough money? "Is it ever enough?" he asks. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=72 ALT="A"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="saldropcap.gif">re you making enough money? You make enough to pay the rent, of course, but that's not the point. Are you making as much as the office nimrod in the next cubicle? You have the same title, do the same work. Wouldn't you be absolutely cheesed if you learned he made more than you?</P>





<P>Man is a competitive beast. We're always looking for ways to put calipers to each other. Now that we're no longer covered with hair and fighting over the same mammoth or saber-toothed tiger, we compare achievements, fight for assignments and compete for positions. And salaries are the first--although not always the best--yardstick we have to measure ourselves as working professionals. Your salary won't begin to measure your worth as a human being, but it will give you some idea of your standing with your company and your status within your profession.</P>





<P>Again, are you making enough money? And how do you find out if your salary is high or low in your business?</P>





<P>The "easiest way to find out is to ask" others what they're earning, says Andrea Harden, human resources consultant for Praxair, Inc., a supplier of industrial gases near Buffalo, N.Y. And if colleagues are reluctant to tell you what they make, Harden says you'd be surprised "how much you can learn just by listening."</P>





<P>There was a time when individuals guarded their salaries the way some governments guarded atomic secrets, but Andrew Ludlow, a public affairs assistant with the Society of Human Resource Management, says young workers may be more willing to break the code of silence. "The younger you are, the more open you are with that information. At least that's the way it seems to me. Older workers are more sheltered and less likely to discuss subjects like salaries," he says. "Also, there's a feeling out process with your first job."
</P>




<P>Some working professionals don't have to be detectives to find out what fellow pros pull down. Rookie golfer Tiger Woods, for example, took home $297,000 for winning the Las Vegas Invitational. And <I>TV Guide</I>  reports Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry and the rest of the cuddly cast of <I>Friends</I> will likely take home $75,000 per episode this season and $85,000 per episode next season.</P>





<P>Unless you're a celebrity actor or athlete, odds are you'll never know what it feels like to read about your salary negotiations in newspapers and magazines. The typical company isn't keen on giving out that kind of information. "There are privacy laws that prevent companies from sharing the salaries of people," says Hardin.</P>





<P>But our competitive nature is the real reason why companies don't want you to know what your pals earn, and it's illustrated perfectly in this sentence from <I>TV Guide</I>: "Warner Bros. executives are none too happy that details of the <I>Friends</I>  negotiations have leaked out; they fear the deal will encourage actors to trash existing contracts if their shows become successful."</P>



<P>There are countless other ways to find out what you should or could be earning. One obvious resource is the Web. Punch the word "salary" or "salaries" into just about any search engine and among the thousands of entries that turn up will be more than a few surveys of salaries for any number of jobs.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/tellus.html">By Bill Thornbro</A></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=4>A</FONT>s any political junkie can tell you, elections are never over. You get post-election analysis for two or three months. The next couple of years are filled with insider books by assorted pundits and Teddy White wannabes. Then scholars--the historians and political scientists--write their books. It's the Hot Stove League for people who live for predictable speeches and the planting and harvesting of campaign yard signs, and it keeps us happy and stoned until roughly a year before the next election, the next fix.</P>

<P>You don't have to be addicted to politics to enjoy the post-election fun. Relax and enjoy. </P>

<P><b>Feel Good About America Again</b> Rep. Bob Dornan, the California Republican who made a career out of mean-spirited C-SPAN speeches to empty House chairs, was never happier than when he was attacking somebody's character. The insufferable Dornan couldn't just disagree with an opponent; he had to hurt them, question their patriotism and morals and call them cruel names. Unbridled arrogance led him to run for the presidency, and even his fellow Republicans cringed when he opened his mouth on the campaign trail.</P>

<P>He served as a substitute host on pal Rush Limbaugh's radio show. Blacks, Jews, women, gays, any supporter of gun-control laws--he had a nasty thing to say about all of them. </P>

<P>Dornan lost a close race to Loretta Sanchez, a relative newcomer to politics. Hispanics and Asians, recent citizens and new to the Orange County district, put her over the top. Was Bob a good sport? Did he lose with dignity? "I will not concede to an inarticulate, flaky, non-qualified person," said Dornan, a classic playground bully. "It would be a travesty to have someone who spent 22 years in the Air Force voted out of office by noncitizens."  Sanchez kept her cool. After the election, Dornan shouted at a fellow California Republican whose only crime was he supported Sanchez.  "You are a poor excuse for a Marine," Dornan screamed. "You are a pathetic old senile man. You are a slimy coward. Go register in another party."</P>

<P>Bob Dole was right. Character <i>does</i>  matter. Voters in the 46th District decided they wanted a representative with some.</P>

<P><b>Be Fair, Be Like Me</b> Of all the columns in the days after the election, none were funnier than the one by Linda Chavez in <i>USA Today</i>. Chavez, a conservative who willingly gave up life in the public arena to join the media, whined about the awful media's liberal bias. It's an old song, one we've heard a million times by Democrats and Republicans alike. Gotta blame somebody for losin' elections, right? Don't wanna blame politicians. That would mean takin' responsibility. No, better to blame the press. Bad, bad media.</P>

<P>Nobody thinks the press plays fair. Chavez--always thinking of others--wrote: "The public has a right to know how reporters, editors and others in positions to influence coverage actually vote, just as they already have the right to know who owns media outlets."</P>

<P>If the media's bias is so obvious, why do we need to know how media people vote? It's obvious, right? If Chavez is right and the media favors Democrats, why do Democrats like strategist James Carville think the press is so unfair to President Clinton? Oh, but that's the problem; the bias is only obvious to Democratic and Republican insiders-- insiders like Chavez who dream of a tool with which to browbeat reporters and twist coverage to suit their agendas. Spin doctors could only do so much in the last election.</P>

<P>Want to know something obvious? Try this: If Linda Chavez really thinks Americans have <i>a right to know</i>  how other Americans vote, it's obvious she's discovered a right overlooked by the Founding Fathers. What else is obvious? People like Chavez don't want the press to be fair; they want the press to slant in their favor. Finally, we can all thank God someone as painfully obvious as Linda Chavez is no longer in government.

<IMG ALT="If"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="if2.jpeg"> you already posses poor credit stay away from companies that may promise to change all of those "credit mistakes". The most common practice for these agencies is to send in many, many, many requests at once to credit reporting agencies. This vain attempt is to try and overwhelm the credit reporting agency hoping they'll just through their hands up in the air and change everything. </P>

<IMG ALT="NEWS FLASH"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="news.jpeg">Companies that report your credit aren't stupid, and they wont change it. The only thing that can change poor credit is time. </P>

<P><B>I don't need anybody to tell me how to spend my money.</B></P>





<P>Your options aren't limited to going to an agency. Taking matters into your own hands could be finding a bank or credit union to give you a consolidation loan. With a consolidation loan you are borrowing money to pay off borrowed money, and shifting credit around doesn't eliminate the problem. Also getting a consolidation loan requires more than a promise that you'll pay it back. </P>





<P>"You usually need to put something up as collateral," said Linda Schultz, a loan representative for Bank One. </P>





<P>Banks want some security on the money they're handing over. No big deal, right? Just small things like a house, car, boat, or anything else that the value is equal to the amount of the loan. And in return for collateralizing your loan you'll get an interest rate that could stretch beyond 20%. If that doesn't seem like too much be prepared to show two years of residence in that state and two years of employment. </P>





<P>The advent of low-interest credit cards presents the best option if you're considering consolidating debt. Companies such as <A HREF="http://www.citicorp.com">Citibank </A>(800-950-5114), 
<A HREF="http://www.chasecard.com">Chase Manhattan</A> (800-282-4273), and Discover (800-347-2683) offer balance transfers. 
</P>




<P>"A balance transfer allows the cardholder to transfer balances from other credit cards to a Citibank card," said Ed Dixon from Citibank public affairs. </P>





<P>According to Dixon, Citibank offers different balance transfer programs at various times during the year to pre-selected Citibank cardholders. These "programs", as Dixon explained, vary in interest rates, but it will be no higher than the interest rate you currently have on your card.
</P>




<P>"The balance transfer does give a lower interest rate than taking a cash advance," said Dixon.</P>





<P>The other major credit card companies also offer balance transfer programs. If you already have a credit card, or are applying for a new one, ask for a balance transfer. You will either be sent checks that you can write to your existing creditors, or banks such as Chase Manhattan can electronically transfer the funds for you.</P>





<P>The darkening hole of debt from charging your way through school can end if you want it to. </P>





<P>"The debt wont go away." said Rhode. "It's not like a fine wine, the situation doesn't get better with age."        <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P><IMG WIDTH=44 HEIGHT=53 ALT="B"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="b.gif">ut employers often look for intangibles, those little things that are hard to express on a resume. When an undecided student comes to Melissa Wahlton, a career coach in New York, she says "go out and get some life experience, at least for a year. It doesn't have to be work. Go out and travel. Get out there and see the world. Just experience life."</P>





<P>When the time comes to go to work, it doesn't "have to be a job that's their major," says Wahlton. "It should be a job where they develop relationships and learn what it's like to work with a team of people and meet deadlines."</P>





<P>Later, should a professional decide to add a master's degree to their credentials, or if they just want the extra education for education's sake, Kathleen Halloran suggests night classes rather than stalling a career to study fulltime. "If they want to stay with their company--the company their currently with--I'd strongly recommend the evening program."</P>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH=450 SIZE=2>

<BR>



<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG WIDTH=450 HEIGHT=72  SRC="quote.gif"></P>


<HR WIDTH=450 SIZE=2>
<BR>


<P>What about the person concerned that if they delay the graduate degree chase, they'll get caught up in career, home and bills and wake up 20 years in the future having never gone back to school? "Obviously, that's an issue. It's easier to stay on the track and get your master's degree," says Melissa Wahlton. "I don't want to be too general. It's different for everybody."</P>





<P>There are people for whom a bachelor's degree is enough personally and professionally. Halloran is currently working toward her master's, but Wahlton, on the other hand, is content with her undergraduate education. "For me, right now, I don't think I'll go back for my master's," says Wahlton.</P>





<P>Still, there will always be critics of today's liberal arts colleges who suggest bachelor's degrees have declined in value over the years. They say serious education has been replaced by puff classes and fuzzy education. "A bachelor's degree carried more weight years ago," says Wahlton. "A degree alone doesn't cut it anymore. What else can you bring to the table? I say experience." </P>

<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Bill Thornbro</A></P><IMG ALT="E"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="e.gif">ducation is valuable currency in this technological age. The classified sections of newspapers and trade publications are full of help-wanted ads that call for, say, "a master's degree in finance, accounting or business." Does this mean a college senior should postpone entering the job market to pursue an advanced degree?</P>





<P>How much is a bachelor's degree worth in today's job market?</P>





<P>"Too often students go straight to graduate school because they are not sure what they want to do and figure that attending graduate school will help them choose a direction. That's a terribly expensive way to make a career decision," says Dr. Alan Goodman, director of the Career Services Office at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.</P>





<P>If a student knows their field of interest and "it requires a graduate degree, by all means go right ahead, especially if the graduate school will pay for their education," says Goodman. However, Goodman points out that most "good MBA programs prefer that candidates have some professional business experience" before admission. "The thinking is, and I agree, that the student's decision to attend graduate school will have been based on some reality testing."</P>





<P>Kathleen Halloran, director of the MBA Career Management department at Arizona State University, is an advocate of that sort of reality testing, and a minimum of two years of work experience is required for entrance into Arizona State's program. "I would strongly urge the student to get real-world experience first," says Halloran.
</P>




<P>That's not just her advice. "The companies that recruit at our campus obviously feel the same way. If you don't have a foundation before you pursue your master's degree, you're at a disadvantage," says Halloran. On average, the person who went straight for their graduate degree is "not going to get the same level of position as the student who has the work experience."</P>





<P>There are always exceptions. Hillary DeMello went on to graduate school after getting her undergraduate degree, "knowing that the graduate degree may not help my career- earning potential in the short-term, but would benefit me down the road."</P>





<P>DeMello couldn't be happier with her decision. "It helped broaden my perspective, which put me ahead of others competing for jobs," she says. After stints at two public relations agencies, DeMello is "now in charge of press relations for International Data Corporation, a high-tech market research firm.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/tellus.html">By Bill Thornbro</A></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>he beginning of a new year is the perfect time to take care of unfinished
business and
clear off the desk. If the desks at ENTER Magazine are unusually messy it's
because
1996 was a busy--and absolutely fantastic--year.</P>

<P>Of all the stuff in the Unfinished Business category, what stands out most
was the easiest
to put off. I think it's time to introduce you to some friends of mine and
tell you a little
about the origin of this special magazine.</P>

<P>ENTER was just a concept in 1995. A few clever ideas and some pretty lofty
dreams
were tossed together like clay on a potter's wheel. Conversations led to
discussions which
became debates that sounded like fights but almost always ended in mutal
agreement.
Eight months of planning went into the magazine before we did the first
interview. And
patient waitresses kept the coffee coming at the Nickel Plate Bar & Grill or
the whole
thing would have gone in the toilet before the first issue. </P>

<P>What you see on your screen right now is our vision of what serious Web
journalism
should be. It's our attempt to bring you the best, most reliable career and
consumer
information available, do it with clear, crisp writing and package it in a
well-organized,
easy-to-navigate site. We want you to survive the transition from college
classroom to
office, but we know your career doesn't mean squat if you're not enjoying
life outside
work. That's why every issue features some humor, a little commentary,
easy-to-follow
recipes and handy reviews of movies and books.</P>

<P>We think the combination makes ENTER unique, and a lot of people agreed in 1996.
<i>Netsurfer Digest</i>, for example, said: "So you have your degree in one
hand and a
mortarboard in the other. What now? Maybe get a close friend to stick ENTER
Magazine
into your pants." I'm still not sure what that means, but it sounds good
enough, and to the
folks at <i>Netsurfer Digest</i>--and to everybody who reviewed us or wrote
to say they
liked us--a hearty thanks. </P>

<P>None of it would be possible without the combined talents of Andrew Vitale
and Douglas
Copfer, two indestructable workaholics and very good friends.</P>

<P>It's Doug's awesome responsiblity to make sure every page is attractive and
doesn't take a
year to materialize on your screen. Just when I think he's been tossed a
story idea that
will be impossible to illustrate, Doug amazes me with just the right art.
The young man
simply understands the marriage of text and graphics as well as anyone on
the Net.</P> 

<P>Andrew is nothing less than the spiritual leader of ENTER Magazine. It was
his idea, his
brainchild. Somehow he manages to juggle the business end of the magazine
and still
write a feature each issue. It's a lot to ask--too much to ask of most
mortals--but he does
it every month. Andrew seems permanently glued to the telephone, and my
guess is he's
responsible for burning up miles of fiber-optic cable. Few people have his
energy,
courage or heart. </P>

<P>I'm never happier than when we're sitting around trying to decide how long a
story on a
Web page can be before a reader scrolls himself to death. It's not like
writing or editing
for newspapers or magazines, which is what I did before ENTER. New mediums
demand
new journalism. I think about that when I'm writing the Welcome letter or
Reason, and I
hope I'm doing my profession proud. </P>


<P>We're not cruising cyberspace alone, of course. God bless writers like Cassandra
Anderson, a terrific lady who helped shape this magazine with her peculiar
style and wit.
Jeff Morris' video reviews are a pleasure to edit. Programmer Don Orban
keeps us afloat,
don't ask me how. Writers all over the country have made us a magazine you
can count
on, and the best part is the ENTER stable of writers grows every month.
We're constantly
looking to add new people and features to the mix--added a couple this
month, in fact--
and your feedback is always welcome. You're crusing cyberspace with us,
remember.
Write us. You've got the address. Don't be a stranger.</P>

<P>That said, we want to wish everyone a safe and prosperous 1997. Thank you
for reading
our magazine.
</P>

<P>That's why LemonBusters has been in business for more than six years, and business isn't slow at over 750 inspections a month. Their intense inspections are performed with diagnostic equipment and experienced mechanics.</P>





<P>"Our ASC certified master technicians will perform a complete 600-point mechanical, electrical, body, and chassis inspection on the vehicle," says Rizzo. "This inspection includes the entire drive train."</P>





<P>Inspecting the drive train involves the engine, transmission, differential, or four-wheel drive unit. 
</P>




<P>And the inspections rolls on. </P>





<P>They will evaluate the brakes, suspension, steering, exhaust, cooling, battery charging, air conditioning, and all the electrical systems before the car is driven anywhere. 
</P>




<P>"We then road test the vehicle for any type of driveability problems," says Rizzo. "such as transmission, shift quality, clutch operation, engine performance, as well as alignment, steering, and any braking problems."</P>





<P>After a thorough examination of the body and frame for any previous damage they will perform a title search and give you 120-point written report of what was found, all within one hour. This report is explained to you and gives approximate costs for making any repairs. All for $78, or $88 if it is a four-wheel drive vehicle.</P>

<P>You only paid four grand for that used car. Great deal. Now you may be looking at a repair bill for several thousand dollars. It's money you don't have and time you can't spare.  That's why you need to know everything that could go wrong before you drive away in what could be an expensive mistake.</P>





<P>Several businesses across the United States are armed with the knowledge and unbiased opinion that will make your used car choice the right one. Two such businesses--LemonBusters, located in Texas, and Lemon Aid in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania--are mobile used car inspection services. Both will travel within their greater metro areas to perform detailed inspections on that shiny, sparkling, sexy, exciting used car. </P>





<P>Don't think you need anything like this? Neither did John Parker.</P>





<P>"I had four good days of carefree driving after I bought my used car." says Parker. "Then on the fifth day I was driving down the road and the entire transmission fell out of the car. No joke. The whole transmission was just lying on the road behind me."</P>





<P>According to Parker the $1,600 he had paid for the car was a great deal at first, but after $1,200 in repairs he could only sell the car for $1,000. </P>





<P>"You have to be careful when you buy a used car because not every state, and that includes Texas, has a lemon law," says Keith Rizzo of LemonBusters.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR><P>Meanwhile, across the nation, Greg Greske has been running Lemon Aid for 15 years. His experience as a state auto inspection technician, mechanic, and used-car manager makes this inspection service invaluable to the used-car shopper.
</P>




<P>"My primary concern is to evaluate the vehicle as whole," said Greske. Explaining that he will determine what the fair market value is for the car so you know if that value is in line with the asking price.
</P>




<P>For $100 Lemon Aid provides the customer with a written report that details what, if anything, is wrong with the car. Then the problems are listed out and repair costs are estimated. </P>





<P>But neither of these two services are searching to fill their repair bays because they have none. Their sole purpose is to help you determine that this is the car you want to buy.</P>





<P>"We're not interested in making any of the repairs," says Rizzo. </P>





<P>Both services offer invaluable information about a used car. And if you plan on purchasing a used car find the used car inspection service in your town. It is your right to have that car inspected.  </P>





<P>"Not many people know this, but Federal law entitles you to at least one inspection," said Rizzo.</P>





<P>And an inspection may be the difference between a carefree drive home, or riding shotgun in a tow truck wondering what the hell went wrong.         <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/end.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><IMG WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=37 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tcap.gif" ALT="T">rucks, sport-utility vehicles and vans. A good chunk of the Rust Belt's
strong economic
rebound can be traced to the huge popularity of these vehicles. After some
pretty
depressing years, even General Motors made big money in 1996. Electric cars
rolled off
the assembly lines and into showrooms. And sales of American-made cars sold
well in--
are you ready?--Japan. There's no reason to believe the growth won't
continue this year.
As a result, the Big Three are actively recruiting bright engineering majors.</P>

<P>The revival of Detroit is a welcome sign across the country. For many
people, a healthy
Detroit is a pyschological boost as well. It's hard to imagine the number of
jobs in this
region that depend on the automotive industry. Hot jobs are in marketing,
advertising and
sales.</P>

<P>Nobody stays unemployed long in the Midwest. It's remarkable but true; all
12 states in
this region are at or below the nation's unemployment level. Half of them
have jobless
figures below 4 percent. Nebraska's unemployment rate is below 3 percent.
Unemployment in Boone County, Missouri, a Midwestern medical and educational
hub,
is a near-perfect 1.3 percent. Salaries are stable, not spectacular. In
fact, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, per capita incomes is over $20,000 in all but
two of these 12
Midwestern states. Starting salaries are rarely massive, but they pay the
bills in a part of
the country famous for its low cost of living.</P>

<P>Many of the new jobs around the region are in the ever-growing service
sector and pay
paltry wages, however. There are no big raises in sight. Companies want
young people
with impressive computer skills but, true to their conservative roots,
they're looking to get
those people dirt cheap. Computer programmers and software developers are on
a lot of
wish lists.</P>

<P>There's no escaping the fact that the Midwest has a "tight" labor market.
However, one
economics professor in Wisconsin said young workers who were "pretty comfortable
with computers, pretty comfortable with abstract reasoning" should be ahead
of the
game.</P>

<P>Next to cars, agriculture is king, and young researchers, chemists and
engineers are
needed in this field as well. As one agri-business professor put it: "It
takes more than
good weather to grow good beans." Some farm equipment manufacturers are happy to
report better sales figures, certainly better than those in the dismal
1980s, but still feel the
economy is too sluggish. "We're the last to feel a recession and the last to
recover.
Always," said one Hoosier economist.</P>

<P>Durable manufacturing is stronger than at any time in the last decade, but
the bloom may
be off the electronics rose, especially in areas where foreign-owned
companies are
involved. Publishers in Indiana, Wisconsin and Minnesota are looking for new
blood and
expect to hit campuses hard this year. There are a number of opportunities
in the medical
and insurance professions, especially in areas that have seen a growth in
specialty clinics.
Think sports medicine.</P>

to tell you
how to start your day. But Bob Dylan was right when he said you didn't "need a
weatherman to know which way the wind blows." If you're a college student
wondering if
your chosen career field will feature sunny skies or thunder showers, Al
Roker can't help
you. ENTER Magazine, however, can.</P>

<P>With this interactive 1997 Job Outlook, we'll tell you which fields are hot
and what parts
of the country are really cooking. Should you relocate? Should you
reconsider careers?
ENTER has digested business information from a number of resources, public and
private. And we interviewed more than 40 business and economics professors,
writers,
human resource professionals and personnel managers to create as accurate a
picture of
career prospects around the country as you're likely to see on the Net--or
anywhere. We
tried hard not to leave any stone unturned. Simply click on a section of the
country, and
we'll blast you to the info you need to make a smart career decision. </P>

<P>The news is generally quite good for the new year. The economy continues to
hum along
at a steady pace, even if some economists think that pace is poky and a
recession is
around the corner. Unemployment around the country remains at near-record
low levels
and any increase will be minimal. Some experts are predicting as many as two
million
new jobs in 1997. Businesses will be all over campuses recruiting the latest
crop of the
best and brightest. Small businesses will be hiring in huge numbers.
Entry-level salaries
will be higher in many cases, especially for high-tech jobs. In short, fair
skies from coast
to coast.</P>

<P>The bad news--if there is bad news--is the competition for many of these
jobs will be
tough. Resumes better look good and interview skills polished to a spit
shine. While
some areas of the country report a diluted talent pool as workers relocate,
most areas
report a glut of extremely talented young professionals. It's a buyer's market.</P>

<P>As you travel this map keep one word in mind:
computers.
You'll quickly see what we mean.</P>

<P>Should you find a sweet used car, remember "the older the car, the higher the rates,"warns Jones. And many financial institutions have a cut off point. Her bank won't finance any model car manufactured before 1989, for example.
</P>

<P>The minimum down payment is pretty much whatever the financial institution wants it to be, although Jones says a typical down payment is around 15 percent. The more you put down, the less you finance and the lower your payments. "We don't really care (howmuch is put down) because the larger the loan the more money we make in interest. But from a consumer standpoint, a larger down payment is good," says Jones.</P>

<P>There are differences in financial institutions that could affect your decision. Finance companies, for example, may be more willing to make riskier loans in exchange for slightly higher rates. Jones says her bank has their own finance company; she says it's actually possible to be rejected for a car loan at her bank but be approved by the same bank's finance company.
</P>

<P>Borrowers should not overlook credit unions. Unlike banks, which are supported by shareholders, credit unions are member-based organizations. "Everybody here has a share in the credit union," says Connie Green, a branch assistant.</P>

<P>Some credit unions are comprised solely of employees of specific companies or organizations, and their loans can be approved or disapproved by committees of co-workers. There may be occasions when a loan application rejected by a bank will be approved by a credit union because committee members are familiar with the applicant, his character and his ability to pay back the loan.</P>

<P>"You'll find our rates are very competitive with banks. Across the board, our rates are very competitive," says Green.</P>

<P>If a borrower is less concerned with qualifying or getting a loan than he is actually paying it off, Green has a suggestion. Many people like the concept of payroll deduction as a way to pay off loans, she says. This way the loan payment is automatically deducted from the employee's paychecks.</P>

<P>That rusty beater served you well while you were in college. But it burned oil, guzzled gas and looked like junk. Forget sentimentality. When you decide you need a <B>REAL</B> car, shop around, ask questions and get the best financing available.</P>

<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P><A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">By Bill Thornbro</A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>E</FONT>ven more than a stylish wardrobe and a cheerful demeanor, a reliable car is necessary to your employment success. After all, you have to <I>get</I> to the job before you can perform well <I>at</I> the job. Unless you're rich as Croesus, however, odds are strong you'll need to finance that new or dependable used car.</P>

<P>Money should be your first consideration. Look at your accumulated savings, your average paycheck, study your monthly budget and examine your credit history. Be prepared to shop around for the best rates. And then ask yourself some key questions. How much can you afford to pay each month in car payments? What kind of down payment can you make? Can you afford the insurance on the make and model you've got your heart set on?</P>

<P>Another question: Can you get a loan on your own? "If they're just starting out, generally young people don't have any credit," says Sandy Jones, a bank business service and sales representative. "They'll need a co-signer."</P>

<P>A co-signer is a joint borrower, a person kind enough to back your loan with their goodname and solid credit history. Besides the obvious obligation to pay back the loan, the borrower also has a moral and ethical responsibility to the co-signer. Should the primary borrower default on the loan, the lending institution can turn to the co-signer for full payment on demand. Even failure to make prompt payments can undermine a co-signer's ability to get other loans in the future.</P>

<P>"If a person makes late payments, that reflects on a co-signer's credit," says Jones.
</P>

<P>While it's not unheard of for a friend or employer to co-sign for a loan,many financial institutions figure borrowers are less inclined to stick a parent or other responsible family member with the balance of a loan. "While it doesn't have to be a family member, we'd like it be family," says Jones.</P>

<P>Jones recommends getting preapproved for a loan. "I think it's a good idea to come in and get preapproved before you go shopping for a car. Established borrowers usually know what their credit is like, but it could be an advantage to anyone," says Jones. And if you're going to go to all the trouble of getting a loan preapproved, you might as well call the insurance agent to find out what your new premiums are going to be. After all, your ability to make those monthly loan payments could be affected by astronomical insurance costs.</P>

<P>Smart car shoppers look for the best interest rates. Institutions like banks, credit unions and financing companies often have their current loan rates posted in a prominent place or listed in brochures available to customers. Car dealers often advertise interest rates, particularly if those rates are irresistibly low.</P>

<P>"If they go through a (car) dealership and fill out a credit application, the dealer will shop around to see who's giving the best rate," says Jones, although she suggests borrowers watch out for "hidden costs" such as prepayment penalties and optional fees in contracts that can balloon the total price of a car.</P>

<P>"Starting with the objective statement your resume should flow correctly and read like a book," says Bird. This makes it even more important to tighten up your facts and limit your "book" to only one page.</P>





<P>Organization throughout your resume is the key to explaining what you can provide to a company. The biggest negatives in a resume are always incorrect spelling, poor organization and sloppiness. "Presentation, presentation, presentation," insists Bird.</P>





<P>After the objective statement, list your employment experience. You may not have several years on the job, but positions you held in school, part-time jobs, activities you've organized and other outside-of-the-classroom experiences are extremely relevant.
</P>




<P>"I like to see an interest in the field or industry," says Richard Burke, a manager of applications development with over fours years of interviewing and hiring. The majority of Burke's experience is with computer science majors in school or recent graduates.</P>





<P>According to Burke showing outside interests proves you're really interested in your field and you're not just in school to get an education.</P>





<P>After listing your experience clearly show what responsibilities and duties you've performed. This list should be relevant to the type of position you're applying for--and make sure to use action words to describe what you've done.</P>





<P>"Some of the better ones (list of responsibilities) show a result expected from a project someone worked on," says Burke. "One or two lines, that's all it takes." </P>





<P>And if you're going to list software or equipment that you're familiar with, make sure you have a clear understanding of what is listed.</P>





<P>"Anyone can pick up PC Week and write down every buzz word that's in there," says Burke. "But after having a conversation with someone for five minutes, I can tell if they know what they're talking about."</P>





<P>Education is usually near the bottom of a resume. All that is needed is your degree, specific major and university. If you want to list a GPA, make sure it's a 3.0 or above.</P>





<P>"I'm not really interested in a GPA, especially for someone with a couple years of experience," says Burke.</P>





<P>After you send your resume in, finding out whether someone has received it is always concern. Give the company some time before you call, and be prepared to leave a message.</P>





<P>"I have to dig through resumes to find a specific one and that takes time," says Veatch.</P>





<P>Competition for entry-level jobs today is fierce. And behind that veil of secrecy is someone who will judge whether you're right for the position you're applying for, making it imperative that you build the best resume.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>he veil of secrecy around sending your resume to a company ends here. Three hiring professionals have stepped forward to unravel the mystery of what makes a powerful resume and what happens when your resume hits the hiring desk.</P>





<P>In today's tough job market, many college students and graduates are frustrated with the luke-warm response their resume seems to generate.</P>

 



<P>"I've been sending my resume out, but I haven't heard anything back," says Scott, a college graduate. "Every ad that I send my resume to says don't call. So I don't know what's going on."</P>





<P>What's wrong with the resume you're sending out? Why hasn't it gotten the response you're looking for?</P>





<P>"What is so frustrating about a lot of the resumes I receive is they leave it up to human resources (departments) to figure out how their skills fit into the company," says Sara Veatch, an associate relations manager, with more than eight years of experience. Veatch's eight years have exposed her to resumes from entry-level to executive level positions. "You need to tell me how you fit into the company."</P>





<P>If you're responding to an ad or sending your resume in blind, although it may be difficult, tailor the information to a specific position.
</P>




<P>"Your resume is a set of facts," says W.C. Bird, a vice president of human resources, with nine years of hiring experience. Those nine years have been spent hiring for sales and marketing positions. </P>





<P>Whether you're applying for a sales position or not, those facts need to sell you to an employer. And you don't have much time to make the pitch and close the deal.</P>





<P>"You get 10 seconds of my time," says Veatch. "I look to see what position you're applying for and then I look for supporting qualifications in the resume. If I don't see anything that qualifies you you go into 'the pile.'"

<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="repairedcap.gif" ALT="W">hen you need a mechanic, do you cross your fingers and flip through the phone directory under grease monkey, or do you ask an experienced friend or relative to recommend a certified professional? It's an important question. Pick the pro and you'll get your car fixed. Pick the other and ...</P>

<P>"Most people aren't made of money," says service manager Charles Egan, "and nobody I know wants to be taken advantage of."</P>

<P>More than a generation has passed since youngsters learned the mystery of the internal combustion engine while they watched their fathers tinker with the family car in the driveway. Back then, even if Dad decided to take the car to the dealer's service department or the corner garage, at least he could identify the problem and know roughly how much the repairs should cost. But cars are too complicated these days for the average shade-tree mechanic, and a lot of people are getting ripped off as a result. "We're paying for our ignorance," says Egan.</P>

<P>How can you protect yourself--and your car--from garage cheats?</P>

<P>"Get estimates in writing. I give written estimates for everything I do. It's like a habit," says Egan. "And go to a certified mechanic. That's the first thing."</P>

<P>Egan says a lot of cheaters "lay in wait" for young customers, particularly women. "They're pretty sure you don't know anything, and most of the time they're right. If a mechanic said you needed a rebuilt engine and all you needed was a new muffler, would you be able to catch him? Most people wouldn't, I think," says Egan. "So get a written estimate and hold them to it."</P>

<P>Egan said a good mechanic--even one up to his ears in work--will gladly estimate how long it will take to make the necessary repairs. Just like going to a certified mechanic isn't a guarantee your car will get repaired right the first time, having a written estimate is no promise the mechanic won't stumble across another problem later. Still, Egan says those two steps alone may stop a significant amount of fraud.</P>

<P>If you still have doubts, don't hesitate to get a second opinion. "It don't hurt my feelings," says Egan.</P>

<P>Crooked mechanics have a number of scams they use to cheat you. According to Egan, these are among the most common ripoffs:</P>

<OL><LI><P> Billing you for time that wasn't spent working on your car. Do you know how long it takes to replace a clutch? The rotten mechanic sure does, and he could be padding your bill with labor charges when he was actually working on somebody else's Chevette.</P>

<LI><P>Charging you for repairs that were never made. A guy can say he fixed your engine, but did he really? Egan says customers should always ask to see old parts before authorizing repairs. "Maybe you don't know what you're looking at," he says, "but telling a guy right off that you want to see an itemized bill or old parts can (help)."</P>

<LI><P>Unnecessary repairs. Example: Suppose you're taking your car to an oil-lube station and you know there's nothing wrong with the almost-new air filter. The mechanic changes the oil but then replaces the air filter without your permission.</P> 

<LI><P>Roadside ripoffs. "These are the guys you see on <I>60 Minutes</I>  a lot," says Egan. "They're real good at faking problems with a little grease or a little bottle of oil." They'll pull their con on just about anybody, but business travelers and senior citizens are always vulnerable. Stuck out in the boondocks and miles from familiar civilization, a stranded driver will almost always pay for the repairs, forgetting that the car or RV was in decent shape when they stopped for gas. "They're real good at poking a hole in your radiator or maybe a tire without you seeing them."</P></OL>

<P>Egan says motorists should never pay cash for repairs. "Put it on your (credit) card," he says. "If you pay with a credit card and the garage ripped you off, take it up with the credit card company and tell them you won't pay till it's corrected. What they'll do is they won't make you pay till the matter is resolved.</P>

<P>"I take Visa and Mastercard," adds Egan with a laugh.</P>

<A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/tellus.html">By Jeff Chandler</A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>T</FONT>ransience in the workplace is increasing. These days once a college student
has landed
that first job, their next question is: How do I get a better job? It's the
unusual worker
who puts in more than a year or two at any job, and nobody stays at one
company for the
duration of a career.</P>

<P>Is that good? What about the person who has experience mostly at temp jobs? </P>

<P>"If you want experience in an office environment, a staffing agency 
provides plenty of  opportunities," says Jeff Grant of Toussaint and 
Company, an Indianapolis-based staffing service and employment 
contractor. </P>

<P>But at what cost? The staffing agency or temporary employment firm can be an
easy way
to develop a number of job experiences in a short span of time. But is it
worth it? Does a
worker look bad if he or she has several jobs on their resume within the
first few years
out of college?</P>

<P>"It depends on the reason for leaving for leaving the job," says
Jack Milligan, a career management consultant with 27 years of human resource
experience. If you're hopping from job to job and not showing an advancement
in your career, you may be in trouble when your resume hits a human
resource professional's desk. According to Mulligan, "if it doesn't show
that (advancement), then cool your jets until you find the job that will
give that upward
mobility."</P>

<P>And if you make it to the interview stage, expect to be asked why you're
looking for a
new job.  According to Milligan, you should
explain "that I'm not really interested in leaving my current position. <IMG  ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="hopquote.gif" ALT="Pull Quote"> I'm
quite happy where I'm at." With that as an opening statement you've
established that you're not running from your job, and more importantly,
you impress upon the interviewer that you wont be running from the job
they're offering anytime soon.</P>

<P>But according to Milligan, you should also
point out that the job you're interviewing for does appear to have the
upward mobility and career direction that you're seeking.</P>

<P>The changing of jobs can be very beneficial to the development of work
experiences.
There was a time, however, when having several 
jobs on a resume was a red flag to a personnel director or human resource 
professional. "If you changed jobs twice or three times you were considered 
unreliable,"  says Anthony Marshal, chairman of the economics department 
at Colombia College in Missouri. "That's no longer the case," he adds, 
because "everyone they see is that way."</P>

<P>However, a career of job hopping will not lead to long term growth, say most
experts.
Companies need people to take responsibility and accountability for their 
work. At some point a person has to put in their time on the job. Rome was
not built in a
day and your career won't be either. </P>

<P><!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG ALT="After"ALIGN=BASELINE SRC="after.jpeg"> determining what you feel you're worth for a position, make sure you know your bottom line. Detail what your expenses are now and the additional costs after accepting a position. These costs could include rent, food, loans, credit cards, clothes for the job, gas to get to work, and lunches out.</P>





<P>"The problem with the college graduate is that $1,000 or $2,000 can make a difference," said Jones. That $1,000 or $2,000 could mean an additional $60 to $120 a month. So try to include costs that may seem insignificant at first but could help get you by in the long run.</P>





<P>Most importantly, according to Beatty, is that you state a salary range as opposed to a figure. This will give you and the interviewer room with which to work.</P>





<P>"Every position has a salary range," said Veatch. Starting your range slightly above what your bottom line is and ending the range about 10 percent above that assures you're asking for an amount you'll need to survive. But if the employer's offer isn't as much as you believe you're worth, are you in a position to negotiate?</P>





<P>"I think there's always room for negotiation," said Veatch. "But I think you need to be realistic."</P>





<P>Being realistic means establishing your value first before you try to negotiate salary, according to Beatty. Furthermore, know the salary range for that position and don't go any higher than 10 percent of what the employer is offering.  
</P>




<P>"Also, being realistic means that sometimes negotiations fall through," said Veatch. </P>





<P>Get a feel for how willing the interviewer is to negotiate and try to weigh the overall picture before you begin to ask for more money. Don't lose sight of what is important to you in the job, and consider what other benefits are involved with the job offer.
</P>




<P>"An average of 30 percent of your salary goes towards benefits," said Jones. </P>





<P>And these benefits are not always apparent at first. Depending on what the employer values, "benefits" could include the work environment, equipment you use, or flexible hours. Take the entire offer into consideration before you ask for the next card in the interviewer's hand.</P>





<P>Interviews will probably always be like a game of cards, but knowing some of the rules to the game could help tip the deck in your favor.         <A HREF="MAILTO:enter@entermag.com">            <IMG SRC="http://www.entermag.com/blkend.jpeg" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BASELINE></A>

Nobody can. But
people with superior computer skills will be in demand as much or more than
any other
professional. Like companies in the rest of the country, Northeast
businesses want people
with extensive computer experience--everything from information system
specialists to
entry-level clerical people who can manage minor desktop publishing. New York,
Boston, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh aren't the only cities with companies
needing high-
tech talent; look for starting salaries at smaller companies around the
region to become
more competitive in 1997. Programmers are hot stuff everywhere.</P>

<P>Four states--New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island and Pennsylvania--have
fairly high
unemployment. Otherwise, unemployment in this region is roughly what it is
for the
country as a whole (5.2 percent), according to the Labor Department. A lot
of people are
content with those numbers. Don't expect a lot of new jobs in the near future.</P>

<P>Some experts think it's time for a dip in the stock market. Even if that's
true, college
seniors looking to begin a career in the financial arena will still find
employers willing to
hire.</P>

<P>Small businesses are expanding--or plan to expand--in many suburban areas,
and based
on last year's performances, a significant percentage anticipate an increase
in hiring
recent grads. Accounting majors have the edge. The picture for larger retail
companies is
more fuzzy. Despite the obviously improved economy, consumer spending didn't
match
expectations at many stores last year, and hiring may suffer as a result.
Business majors
beware. While one source says hiring will increase 15-to-20 percent, another
source
swears hiring of new graduates may not increase much at all. Nobody agrees.</P>

<P>A strong portfolio has never been more important, particularly for young
people looking
to build a career in marketing and public relations. Firms--especially those
outside the
huge metro areas--will be out in force scouting clever candidates. Market
research
analysts, communications and telecommunications specialists will be popular.
Starting
salaries won't match those of industrial or computer engineering majors, but
they never
will. Despite an expressed desire to find more job candidates with strong
oral or written
communications skills, most companies aren't willing to cough up attractive
salaries. Or
as one professor at a Southern university put it: "What (businesses) say
they want and
who they hire are often two different things."</P>

<P>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, work in this region is spread
out about the
same; roughly 25-to-30 percent of all jobs are in the service industry,
maybe 20-to-25
percent in trade, 10-to-18 percent in manufacturing, and another 13-to-15
percent in
government. In case you haven't heard, government is <i>shrinking</i>, not
growing.
The service industry, however, should hold firm or grow slightly in 1997,
particularly in
states like New York and Connecticutt. In fact, NACE expects service
employers in this
region to increase hires of recent graduates nearly 13 percent.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>D</FONT>o you know how much everything you own is worth? How about if you came home and you didn't have anything left except the clothes you were wearing? How much would it cost to start from scratch, absolutely nothing, and get back to a decent standard of living?</P>





<P>Those were not hypothetical questions on July 6, 1996, when five units of a 16-unit apartment building were burned to the ground. Nothing left to come home to, because there was no home. And only one of those residents had renter's insurance.</P>





<P>"The most important thing about renter's insurance is that you get replacement cost of contents," says Bruce Flynn Jr., an insurance agent with State Farm. Replacement cost means that your insurance company will replace your old stuff with new, similar-quality merchandise if it is lost in a fire, flood, lightning, theft, a broken pipe, tornado--any accident. If it's gone, it will be replaced through renter's insurance.</P>





<P>According to Flynn, the reason replacement cost is so important to someone in college or right out of college is because you may have a lot of things that were given to you by your parents, relatives or friends. "Until you lose those things, you can take for granted what it would take to buy new or replacement merchandise," says Flynn.</P>





<P>You've never been without clothing. You may have five pairs of jeans, a suit, several dresses, underwear, socks, shoes and more. If any of those clothes are three years old or older, their current value is zero. Those clothes may cost hundreds--maybe thousands--of dollars to replace if they're lost, however. With renter's insurance, it doesn't matter what they were worth, a policy will cover the cost of replacing them if you had to buy them all today.</P>





<P>Could you remember everything you own off the top of your head? "All I want to know is where's the stuff? In a total fire loss I want to pay you exactly what I owe you," says Flynn.</P>





<P><!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="fire2.gif">To get an accurate picture of everything you own and what it would cost to replace it, Flynn recommends going through your entire apartment with a video camera. What you are doing is creating a personal inventory. "Document your socks, your belts, your shoes, everything you own--take a video," says Flynn. Carefully record each item by describing it in detail, and after you're finished you will have a complete record. But you'll need to protect the tape by placing it in a fireproof box or take it offsite.</P>





<P>Kate Eshelbrenner can't agree more with Flynn. Eshelbrenner, a recent college graduate, witnessed the total loss of five apartment units first-hand as a leasing consultant. "Renter's insurance is something you have to have because it is so dangerous not to. Naturally, the people who didn't have renter's insurance were very upset because they lost everything they owned. But there's nothing that we can do to restore what they lost," says Eshelbrenner.</P>

Renter's insurance isn't just about replacing your stuff. It will also help protect you against liability. According to Flynn, liability is the strongest point concerning renter's insurance, and he knows. One of his clients fell asleep on her couch with candles burning and the entire apartment building burned down. His client is now liable not only her own stuff but for the loss of all the other units in the building and the building itself.</P>





<P>Even though burning down an entire building may seem like an extreme case, any loss you cause you will have to cover. "A lot of people think that their most valuable asset is their CD player, CD collection, clothing etc.," says Flynn. But your most valuable asset out of college is your ability to earn wages. It's your ability to make money that becomes known as your human life value.</P>





<P>Human life value is determined by what you are making now and what you have the potential to make over your lifetime. If you're found liable, your paycheck will be garnished for the rest of your life, or until you pay back the entire loss. All this takes place after they're done liquidating your assets.</P>





<P>"A lot of people say, 'I'll just file bankruptcy,'" says Flynn. "Go ahead and file bankruptcy on a court judgment and see how that takes you. You can file against your creditors, but you can't file against a court judgment." Renter's insurance will cover a large portion, if not all, of a judgment if you're found liable for an incident.</P>





<P>Aside from a total loss, your policy covers you no matter where you are in the world. If you're heading overseas after school and your suitcase is stolen with all of your clothes in it, you'll be covered for replacement costs.</P>





<P>"A lot of people don't think of it (renter's insurance)," says Eshelbrenner. "One of my friends that doesn't have it says she keeps on forgetting to call." And as Eshelbrenner explains, "forgetting to call isn't going to bring all your stuff back if it's all gone."</P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dropo.gif" ALT="O">nly in a world sketched by Dr. Suess would bulls and bears  become characters that define a set of beliefs that represent the best  and worst outlook for society. But <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/nov/features/terms/terms1.html#bull">bulls</A> and <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/nov/features/terms/terms1.html#bear">bears</A> have jumped from the  pages of children's literature and trampled their way down Wall Street.  As cuddly or intoxicating as it might sound, investing is not  the place for fantasy or amateurs.</P>

<P>"There are traps for people who would be penny wise and pound foolish,"  says Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington, a Washington  D.C.-based investment advisor firm. "If it was easy then there would be  people with a lot more experience and a lot more money."</P>

<P>According to Farr, "Investing in the stock market is seldom as risky as  when you're a beginner." You can very easily get swallowed into a world  where millions are made and lost instantly and the <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/nov/features/terms/terms1.html">lingo</A> is rattled off  at a frantic pace. "Odds are you're never going to know what the market  doesn't already know," says Farr. So that hot tip that you unearthed on  the Internet this morning was last night's--or last month's--news, and  the market has already reflected that information.</P>

<P>The basic nature of investing is investment horizon. Your investment  horizon is how long you're willing to commit your funds to an  investment. "The longer your horizon, the better you can make money,"  says Farr. "The worst that can happen to the new investor is they go in  for the short term and make money."</P>

<P>According to all the investment advisors ENTER interviewed, you will  need to hold an investment in the stock market for at least three years--and preferably longer that five years. "This is because even quality  companies have hiccups and can be judged only over a full three-to-five  year market cycle," says Farr. If your investment horizon is short  because you're saving for a down payment on a new car or house and not  retirement then the stock market is not the place to put your hard  earned cash.</P>

<P>Farr offers this example of what can happen if you purchase a stock and  you do not have a long investment horizon. "If you purchased 100 <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/nov/features/terms/terms1.html#common">shares</A>  of Intel in November 1995, you would have paid about $7,000. In January  1996, your investment in Intel was down to $5,000."</P>

<P>A lot of new investors with short investment horizons will tremble at  the first signs they're losing money. And according to Harold Evensky, a  financial planner specializing in investing, the biggest problem is "that you get scared and sell when it goes down instead of staying in  for the long run." If you're likely to get scared and panic, you may want to look at <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/nov/features/terms/terms1.html#mutualfund">mutual funds</A>. "You get a big bang for your buck in mutual funds," says Evensky.</P>

<P>Mutual funds are investments in the stocks of a lot of different  companies. According to Farr, "The shares of the fund are sold so that a  single share represents fractional interests in all of the companies  owned by the fund." It's this ability to spread your money around that  have made mutual funds so attractive recently, because you don't want to  put all of your eggs in one basket.</P>

<P>"The most important decision is allocation. How much you can put in  stocks, <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/nov/features/terms/terms1.html#bond">bonds</A> and mutual funds," says Evensky. Your allocation helps to  buffer the constant changes that occur in the marketplace. </P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dropt.gif" ALT="T">o purchase mutual funds, stocks or bonds you'll need to go through a  broker. The trick is to find someone you can trust with your money as  much as you trust yourself. "I'd be aware that anybody but a discount  broker lives on <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/nov/features/terms/terms1.html#commission">commission</A>," says Jay Marchand, a professor of finance  at Westminster college of Salt Lake. The best way to find a reputable  broker is to ask your friends, relatives or co-workers; people whose  opinion you trust. This personal reference also helps if you are not  investing a lot money (less than $5,000) at once.</P>

<P>"Ideally you want the friend to make an introduction," says Farr. Make  sure that the broker has at least five years of experience and you  should check them out through the Public Disclosure Program  (800-289-9999) provided by the <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/nov/features/terms/terms1.html#nasd">National  Association of Securities Dealers.</A>  Also, ask  the broker how well the recommendations by the firm they work for have  done over the last several years, says Marchand.</P>

<P>If you purchase stock from a broker you want to consider buying stock in  what is called "round lots." Round lots are 100 shares of stock in a  company. But every share of stock that is for sale isn't always the  price you see in <I>USA Today</I>. The stock market updates every second and  this morning's paper has yesterday's closing prices. Even getting stock  quotes online is delayed 15 minutes. So be aware that while you're on  hold with your broker the stock price probably just changed.</P>

<P>When is the best time make an investment? "The best time to buy is when  you have money," says Farr. If you have the money then you'll also need  to know how well you can handle the risk of losing it all. Playing the  stock market can be just like dropping quarters in a slot machine; what  at first seemed like a sure payoff could leave you broke in the end.  "How much volatility can you handle before you jump out of a window?"  asks Evensky.</P>

<P>If the risk of losing even a little bit of money or the market's frantic  pace gnaws at you until you can't sleep or eat, then you may want to look  at putting your money in low risk investments. "Unless a person is  willing to take risk they should look at a savings account," says  Marchand. You can also consider investing in the company you work for,  <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/nov/features/terms/terms1.html#cds">Certificates of Deposit (CDs)</A> or a <A HREF="http://www.entermag.com/nov/features/terms/terms1.html#moneymarket">money market</A>. </P>

<P>The investment world's bull and bears are not drawn as neatly as a  lesson in morality from Dr. Suess, but they can foreshadow good and  bad things to come, and it is something important to learn. "As you're beginning to  invest as a young person, you are continuing your education," says Farr. </P>

<center><table><tr><td>
<b>You are more than just the sum of your body parts.  That's why doctors of osteopathic medicine (DOs) practice a "whole person" approach to medicine.  Instead of just treating specific symptoms, osteopathic physicians concentrate on treating you as a whole.<p>


Osteopathic physicians understand how all the body's systems are interconnected and how each one affects the others.  They focus special attention on the musculoskeletal system, which reflects and influences the condition of all other body systems.<p>
</td><td>
<img src="11om.jpg"></td></tr></table></center><p>

<b>
This system of bones and muscles makes up about two-thirds of the body's mass, and a routine part of the osteopathic patient examination is a careful evaluation of these important structures.  DOs know that the body's structure plays a critical role in its ability to function.  They can use their eyes and hands to identify structural problems and to support the body's natural tendency toward health and self-healing.<p>

Osteopathic physicians also use their ears to listen to you and your health
concerns.  Doctors of osteopathic medicine help patients develop attitudes and lifestyles that don't just fight illness, but help prevent it, too.  Millions of Americans prefer this concerned and compassionate care, and have made DOs their doctors for life.<p>
<center><img src="rule.gif"></center><p>
<h2>Professional Education</h2><br>

To become an osteopathic physician an individual must be a graduate of an
 osteopathic medical school.  Each school is accredited by the Bureau
of Professional Education of the American Osteopathic Association.  This
accreditation is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the
Council on Postsecondary Education.  Typically, applicants to osteopathic
colleges have a four-year undergraduate degree, and complete specific
science courses.  Applicants must take the Medical College Admissions Test
(MCAT).  Osteopathic medical schools also require a personal interview to
assess the student's interpersonal communication skills.<p>

The osteopathic curriculum involves four years of academic study.  As a
reflection of the osteopathic philosophy, the curriculum emphasizes
preventive medicine and holistic patient care.  Medical students learn to
use osteopathic principles and techniques for diagnosis and treatment of
disease throughout the curriculum.<p>

After completing osteopathic medical college, DOs serve a one-year
internship, gaining hands-on experience in internal medicine,
obstetrics/gynecology, family practice, pediatrics and surgery.  This
experience ensures that osteopathic physicians are first trained as primary care physicians even if they plan to pursue a specialty.  The internship provides every DO with the perspective to see and treat every patient as a whole person.<p>

Many DOs then choose to take a residency program in a specialty area, such
as internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, radiology or pathology.  A
residency typically requires from two to six years of additional training.
<p>
<center><img src="rule.gif"></center><p>
<h2>Licensure</h2><br>

All physicians (both DOs and MDs) must pass a state medical board examination in order to obtain a license and enter practice.  Each state board sets its own requirements and then issues the license for the physician to practice in that state.<p>

Additional information may be found in the pages on <A href="whatdo.htm"> "What is a DO?"</a>, <a href="omededuc.htm">"Osteopathic Medical Education"</a>, and <a href="omt.htm">OMT:  Hands-On Care</a>.<p>
<center><img src="rule.gif"></center><p>
<h2>Complete Care</h2>

<table><tr><td>
<b>
DOs are complete physicians.  That means they are fully trained and
licensed to prescribe medication and to perform surgery.  DOs and
allopathic physicians (MDs) are the only two types of complete
physicians.<p>

DOs practice in all branches of medicine and surgery, from psychiatry to
obstetrics; from geriatrics to emergency medicine.  However, DOs are trained to be doctors first, and specialists second.  The majority are family-oriented, primary care physicians.  Many DOs practice in small towns and rural areas, where they often care for entire families and whole communities.

<h2>Some facts about osteopathic physicians:</h2>

<UL>
<LI>By the year 2000, it is expected that 45,000 osteopathic physicians will be in practice in the U.S.

<LI>Over half of all DOs practice in the primary care areas of general practice, internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology and pediatrics.

<LI>DOs represent 5.5% of the total U.S. physician population and 10% of
all U.S. military physicians.

<LI>Each year, 100 million patient visits are made to DOs.

<b>If you're like most people, you've been going to a doctor since you were born, and perhaps were not aware whether you were seeing a DO (Osteopathic Physician) or an MD (Allopathic Physician).  You may not even be aware that these are the only two types of complete physicians in the United States.<P>

<center>

<img src="bkgd.gif" height=5 width=40></td><td><b>

<center><img src="rule.gif"></center><p>

<h2>DOs and MDs are alike in many ways:</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Applicants to both DO and MD colleges typically have a four-year undergraduate degree with an emphasis on science courses.
<LI>Both DOs and MDs complete four years of basic medical education.
<LI>After medical school, both DOs and MDs can choose to practice in a specialty area of medicine -- such as psychiatry, surgery, or obstetrics -- after completing a residency program (typically two to six years of additional training).
<LI>Both DOs and MDs must pass comparable state licensing examinations.
<LI>DOs and MDs both practice in fully accredited and licensed hospitals and medical centers.

</UL>
<P>
DOs comprise a separate, yet equal branch of American medical care.  Together, DOs and MDs enhance the state of care available in America.<p>

However, it's the ways that DOs and MDs are different that can bring an extra dimension to your family's healthcare.<p>


<center><img src="rule.gif"></center><p>

<h2>100 Years of Unique Care</h2>


Osteopathic medicine is a unique form of American medical care that was
developed in 1874 by Andrew Taylor Still, MD.   Dr. Still was dissatisfied with the effectiveness of 19th Century medicine.  He believed that many of the medications of his day were useless or even harmful.  Dr. Still was one of the first in his time to study the attributes of good health so that he could better understand the process of disease.<P>

<table><tr>

<td>
<img src="14do.jpg">
</td>

<td><b>
In response, Dr. Still founded a philosophy of medicine based on ideas that date back to Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine.  The philosophy focuses on the unity of all body parts.  He identified the musculoskeletal system as a key element of health.  He recognized the body's ability to heal itself and stressed preventive medicine, eating properly and keeping fit.<p>

Dr. Still pioneered the concept of "wellness" 100 years ago.  In today's
terms, personal health risks - such as smoking, high blood pressure,
excessive cholesterol levels, stress and other lifestyle factors - are
evaluated for each individual.  In coordination with appropriate medical
treatment, the osteopathic physician acts as a teacher to help patients take more responsibility for their own well-being and change unhealthy patterns.
</td>

</tr></table><p>



Sports medicine is also a natural outgrowth of osteopathic practice, because of its focus on the musculoskeletal system, osteopathic manipulative treatment, diet, exerecise and fitness.  Many professional sports team physicians, Olympic physicians and personal sports medicine physicians are DOs.<p>


<center><img src="rule.gif"></center><p>
<h2>21st Century,  Frontier Medicine</h2>

Just as Dr. Still pioneered osteopathic medicine on the Missouri frontier in 1874, today osteopathic physicians serve as modern day medical pioneers.<p>

They continue the tradition of bringing healthcare to areas of greatest
need:

<ul>
<li>Over half of all osteopathic physicians practice in primary care areas, such as pediatrics, general practice obstetrics/gynecology and internal medicine.

<li>Many DOs fill a critical need for family doctors by practicing in
small towns and rural areas.
</ul><p>

<center>
<table width=85%><tr><td><b>
Osteopathic physicians are on the cutting edge of modern medicine.  However, DOs do not rely solely on the latest medical technology.  They combine today's medical advances with other, more basic, tools -- their ears to listen carefully to their patients; their eyes to see their patients as whole persons; and their hands to diagnose and treat injury and illness.
</td>

<td><img src="15do.jpg"></td>

</tr></table></center><br>

Additional information may be found in the American Osteopathic
Association's web pages on <a href="omed.htm">"Osteopathic Medicine"</a> , <a href="omededuc.htm">"Osteopathic Medical Education"</a>, and <a href="omt.htm">"OMT:  Hands-On Care"</a>.<p>


<center><img src="rule.gif"></center><p>
<h2>DOs bring something extra to medicine:</h2>


<ul>
<li>Osteopathic medical schools emphasize training students to be primary care physicians.

<li>DOs practice a "whole person" approach to medicine.  Instead of just treating specific symptoms or illnesses, they regard your body as an integrated whole.

<li>Osteopathic physicians focus on preventive healthcare.

<li>DOs receive extra training in the musculoskeletal system - your body's interconnected system of nerves, muscles and bones that make up two-thirds of its body mass.  This training provides osteopathic physicians with a better understanding of the ways that an injury or illness in one part of your body can affect another.  It gives DOs a therapeutic and diagnostic advantage over those who do not receive additional specialized training.

<li>Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is incorporated in the training and practice of osteopathic physicians.  OMT allows physicians to use their hands to diagnose injury and illness and to encourage your body's natural tendency toward good health.  By combining all medical technologies -- from medication to surgery -- with OMT, DOs offer their patients the most comprehensive care available in medicine today.

<b>Si usted, como casi toda la gente, ha estado visitando al doctor desde que vino al mundo, tal vez no se ha dado cuenta si su m&#233;dico es un doctor osteop&#225;tico (DO) o un m&#233;dico en medicina general (MD).  Tal vez no se ha dado cuenta de que en los Estados Unidos existen estos dos tipos de m&#233;dicos.

<h2>Los DOs y los DMs son parecidos en muchos aspectos:</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Los aspirantes a DO (doctores osteop&#225;ticos) y DM (doctores en medicina) generalmente obtienen un t&#237;tulo universitario en ciencias de cuatro a&#241;os.
<LI>Tanto los doctores osteop&#225;ticos como los doctores en medicina terminan cuatro a&#241;os de educaci&#243;n m&#233;dica b&#225;sica.
<LI>Despu&#233;s de la escuela de medicina ambos doctores pueden hacer su pr&#225;ctica en cualquier especialidad del campo de la medicina; psiquiatr&#237;a, cirug&#237;a u obstetricia.  Esto es despu&#233;s de haber terminado un programa de residencia (generalmente de dos a seis a&#241;os de entrenamiento adicional).
<LI>Ambos aspirantes deben de pasar ex&#225;menes similares para la obtenci&#243;n de licencias estatales.
<LI>Ambas especialidades tienen su pr&#225;ctica en un hospital o centro m&#233;dico totalmente acreditado y con licencia de pr&#225;ctica.

</UL>
<P>
Dentro del cuidado m&#233;dico en los Estados Unidos, los doctores osteop&#225;ticos comprenden una rama distinta, aunque son verdaderamente lo mismo que los doctores en medicina general.  Ambas ramas alcanzan un nivel m&#225;s alto en la medcina disponible en los Estados Unidos.<p>

Sin embargo, las diferencias de estas dos carreras son las que le pueden brindar a su familia una dimensi&#243;n extra o tal vez distinta en cuidados de salud.<p>

<h2>100 A&#241;os de Cuidado &#218;nico</h2>


La medicina osteop&#225;tica es una forma &#250;nica del cuidado m&#233;dico americano que fuera desarrollado en 1874 por el doctor Andrew Taylor Still.  El doctor Still no estaba satisfecho con la efectividad de la medicina del siglo XIX.  El cre&#237;a que muchos de los medicamentos de su &#233;poca no ten&#237;an utilidad y que hasta pod&#237;an ser da&#241;inos.  El doctor Still fue uno de los primeros de su &#233;poca en estudiar los atributos de la buena salud para que
as&#237; pudiera entender mejor el proceso de las enfermedades.<P>

<table><tr>

<td>
<img src="14do.jpg">
</td>

<td><b>
Como una respuesta a ello, el doctor Still fund&#243; una filosof&#237;a m&#233;dica basada en ideas desarrolladas en los tiempos de Hip&#243;crates, el padre de la medicina.  Esta filosof&#237;a se enfoca en la unidad de todas las partes del cuerpo, e identific&#243 el sistema oseomuscular como un elemento clave en la salud.  Reconoci&#243; tambi&#233;n la habilidad del cuerpo para curarse a s&#237; mismo y enfatiz&#243; la medicina preventiva, comer bien y mantenerse en buena forma f&#237;sica.<p>

Hace 100 a&#241;os el doctor Still fue pionero del concepto del "bienestar".  En los t&#233;rminos de hoy en d&#237;a, riesgos personales de salud, tales como:  fumar, presi&#243;n alta de la sangre, niveles excesivos de colesterol, estr&#233;s y otros factores de estilo de vida, son evaluados para cada individuo.  En coordinaci&#243;n con el tratamiento m&#233;dico apropiado, el doctor osteop&#225;tico act&#250;a como un maestro para ayudar a los pacientes a tomar m&#225;s responsabilidad en su propio bienestar y cambiar patrones de conducta que no son saludables.

La medicina deportiva brinda un campo de crecimiento a la pr&#225;ctica osteop&#225;tica debido a su concentraci&#243;n en el sistema oseomuscular, el tratamiento de manipulaci&#243;n osteop&#225;tica, la dieta y los ejercicios f&#237;sicos.  Muchos doctores en medicina deportiva, los m&#233;dicos que trabajan en olimpiadas, as&#237; como doctores privados de estrellas deportivas son tambi&#233;n m&#233;dicos osteop&#225;ticos.<p>

<h2>La Medicina Pionera del Siglo XXI</h2>

As&#237; como en 1874 el doctor Still fue un pionero en la
medicina osteop&#225;tica en la frontera de Missouri, hoy
en d&#237;a, los doctores osteop&#225;ticos son pioneros en la
pr&#225;tica m&#233;dica moderna.

Estos doctores contin&#250;an con la tradici&#243;n de llevar el
cuidado de la salud a las &#225;reas con mayor necesidad:

pediatr&#237;a, pr&#225;ctica general en obstetricia y gine
colog&#237;a, y medicina interna.

<LI>Muchos doctores osteop&#225;ticos cubren una cr&#237;tica

<h2>Los DOs aportan m&#225;s a la medicina: </h2>


<ul>
<li>En las escuelas de medicina osteop&#225;tica el 
entretamiento que se les da a los estudiantes es para
formarlos como m&#233;dicos de cuidados primarios.

<li>Los doctores osteop&#225;ticos practican un m&#233;todo
denominado "persona completa".  Este m&#233;todo consiste 
en no tratar las enfermedades como s&#237;ntomas
aislados, sino tratarlas como problemas de todo el
cuerpo.

<li>Los doctores osteop&#225;ticos se enfocan en el 
cuidado de la salud preventiva.

<li>Los doctores osteop&#225;ticos reciben un entrenamiento 
adicional sobre el sistema oseomuscular; el sistema que 
conecta a todo el cuerpo, y que consiste en nervios, 
m&#250;sculos y huesos.  Este entrenamiento
comprende dos tercios de la masa corporal.  As&#237;
los doctores osteop&#225;ticos adquieren un mejor
entendimiento de c&#243mo una enfermedad en una
parte del cuerpo puede afectar otra parte de &#233ste.
El entrenamiento le da a los doctores osteop&#225;ticos
una ventaja en terapia y diagn&#243;stico que otros
doctores no adquieren al no recibir este entrenamiento 
especializado.

<li>El Tratamiento Osteop&#225;tico de Manipulaci&#243n (OMT,
por sus siglas en ingl&#233s) es incorporado al entrenamiento 
y pr&#225ctica de los m&#233;dicos osteop&#225;ticos.  Con
el OMT, los doctores osteop&#225;ticos usan sus manos
para diagnosticar da&#241;os y enfermedades, tambi&#233;n
promueven la tendencia natural que el cuerpo tiene
hacia la buena salud.  Al combinar todos los procedimientos 
m&#233;dicos con el OMT, los doctores osteop&#225;ticos
ofrecen a sus pacientes el cuidado m&#225;s completo y
disponible en la medicina de hoy.

In today's healthcare enivironment, you can't afford to ignore the
fact that osteopathic medicine is a primary choice in good medical care.<p>

There are nearly 40,000 doctors of osteopathic medicine (DOs) throughout the
country who treat hundreds of thousands of patients every single day.<p>

<h2>Subscriber Loyalty</h2>

Including this important profession in your plan can go a long way toward helping you realize your plan's objectives for increased subscribers.<p>

This has been shown in a recent survey of more than 825,500 physician referral requests in eight major cities.  Consumer Health Reports, Inc., a non-profit group, found that one of the top five requested qualities of family practitioners is that they be a DO.<p>

This puts osteopathic training with other top qualities such as: extended appointment hours, a female doctor, and an interactive/educational style.<p>

By giving your subscribers the flexibility of choice, you immediately increase their receptiveness and loyalty to the plan.<p>

<h2>Cost savings and hospitalization reduction</h2>

Including DOs as a choice in your plan can also help reduce the costs
of medical services, therapies, and hospitalization.<p>

In an independent survey comparing hospitals in Toledo, Ohio, the osteopathic medical center had fewer average bed-days, lower average payment per patient, and lower average related expenses.<p>

<h2>An added treatment: OMT</H2>
DOs are dedicated to preventive, primary care medicine and can offer osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) as a unique tool.<p>

OMT is incorporated in the training and practice of DOs, which gives them a diagnostic and therapeutic advantage.<p>

Its basis is hands-on treatment of the musculoskeletal system.  Manipulating this interconnected network of nerves, muscles, and bones can encourage the body's natural tendency to heal and maintain good health.<p>

OMT is commonly used by DO family practitioners and specialists for many different medical conditions, such as back pain, neck pain, and headaches.  By combining OMT with medication, surgery, and other procedures, DOs offer patients the most comprehensive care available.<p>

In an era marked by medical advances, from state-of-the-art surgery to the newest prescription medication, what unique tool will osteopathic physicians use?<p>

<center>
<table><tr><td align=center><b>
Their hands.</td><td><img src="06omt.jpg"></td></tr></table></center>

<p>

Osteopathic physicians (DOs) provide you with all of the best that medicine
has to offer.  They can specialize in every recognized area of medicine, from
pediatrics to neurosurgery.  However, their knowledge and use of the latest
medical technology is complemented by their application of a hands-on
diagnosis and treatment tool known as osteopathic manipulative treatment, or
OMT.<p>

Using OMT, DOs bring an added dimension to healthcare, in the form of a non-
invasive therapy.  DOs use OMT to diagnose, treat, and even prevent illness
or injury.  And when appropriate, OMT can be used in conjunction with (or in
place of) medication or surgery.<p>


<center><img src="rule.gif"></center><p>

<h2>Osteopathic Medicine: A Unique Philosophy of Care</h2>

<img src="07omt.jpg" align=right><br>

DOs are widely recognized for their incorporation of manipulative medicine
into their spectrum of care; OMT, however, is just one element of the unique
philosophy of osteopathic medicine.<p><br>

<center>
<font size=+2><I>The Big Picture</I></font><br>
</center>

DOs take a whole person approach to care, and don't just focus on a diseased
or injured part.  They look for underlying causes for disease, instead of
simply treating your symptoms.  And they consider your physical condition,
plus mental and emotional factors (home, work and family, etc.) when diagnosing you.  In keeping with their holistic approach to care, you'll find many DOs in
primary care (family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and
gynecology).<p>

<center>
<font size=+2><I>Patient, Heal Thyself</I></font><p>
</center>

DOs recognize that the body is inherently capable of healing
itself, though it must constantly fight physical, emotional,
chemical and nutritional "stressors" to maintain a state of
wellness.  DOs believe in educating you about good health and
avoidance of disease. If either occurs, however, DOs recognize
that medication, surgery, and often OMT are necessary elements of
treatment.<p>

<center>
<font size=+2><I>The Musculoskeletal System</I></font><p>
</center>


DOs believe that all of the body's systems, including the
musculoskeletal system, work together, and that disturbances in
one system may impact function elsewhere in the body.  This
understanding of body structure and organic function is at the
core of the osteopathic approach to medicine.<p>

DOs place particular emphasis on the musculoskeletal system,
which comprises two-thirds of the body's mass; they use OMT to
manually assess and treat illness or injury.<p>

<CENTER>
<img src="rule.gif">
</CENTER>
<p>

<h2>The ABC's of OMT and How It Can Work for You</h2>

OMT is predicated upon your DO's knowledge of medicine.  Once
your DO has ruled out non-mechanical causes for your illness or
injury (through blood and urine testing, x- rays, etc.), and based
upon physical/mechanical findings, he may decide to utilize
manipulation.  While manipulative medicine is commonly associated
with physical ailments such as low back pain, this far-reaching
treatment modality can also be used to relieve the discomfort or
musculoskeletal abnormality associated with a number of disorders, 
including:<br>

<UL>
<LI>Asthma
<LI>Sinus Disorder
<LI>Carpal Tunnel
<LI>Migraines
<LI>Menstrual Pain
</UL>

The osteopathic approach to treating many diseases includes medication and/or
surgical intervention, plus manipulation.  OMT can relieve muscle pain
associated with a disease, and can hasten your recovery from illness by
promoting blood flow through tissues.<p>

<h2>Your Structural Exam:</h2>

<center><font size=+1>Diagnosis</font></center><p>

Your structural exam will begin with an assessment of your posture, spine and
balance.  Your DO will then use his fingers to palpate your back and extremities.  He will also check your joints for restriction and/or pain during motion,
as well as your muscles, tendons and ligaments, where tenderness can signal a
problem.  Through extensive osteopathic training in manipulative medicine, DOs
can detect changes in tissue, however small, that signal injury or impairment.<p>

Once the structural exam is complete, your DO will integrate this information
with your medical history and a complete physical exam, and will then establish
a treatment plan.<p>

<center><font size=+1>Treatment</font></center><p>

Using a variety of OMT techniques, your DO will apply manual forces to your
body's affected areas to treat structural abnormalities, and will then apply
specific corrective forces to relieve joint restrictions and misalignments.
Based upon the complexity or severity of your problem, you may require more than
one treatment.<p>

<h2>The Osteopathic Approach</H2>

<table width=75%><tr><td><b>
<font size=+2>Case 1:</font><p>
Mary visited her DO complaining of a sharp pain in her side.  The physician asked a
series of questions about her pain, its intensity, onset and duration; they also
discussed her medical history.  The physician then ordered a series of tests to
determine whether the pain was caused by disease (ie: gallbladder or appendix).  Tests
revealed that it was not.  Since the patient indicated that she worked in an office
with a "surround-style" desk, the DO considered that Mary might be suffering from
postural/mechanical strain.  Based upon his examination, interview with the patient,
and the negative test results, the physician decided to employ manipulation to relieve
motion restrictions and muscle strain caused by improper sifting and movement.  He
also recommended changes in the set-up of her workstation to alleviate further pain.

Michael's symptoms included cough, congestion, fever and headache.  Suspecting chronic

confirmed the diagnosis, the physician prescribed an antibiotic to treat the
infection; she also employed a variety of OMT techniques to promote sinus drainage and
relieve pain related to the infection.  Michael's congestion was markedly reduced
after just one OMT session.  Upon completion of his antibiotic therapy two weeks
later, his infection was eliminated.</td></tr></table></center>

Through OMT, people of all ages and backgrounds have found relief from pain and
dysfunction.  DOs incorporate OMT into their treatment plans for top athletes
and performance artists; workers with on-the-job injuries and hundreds of
thousands of people, just like you.  Those who have enjoyed the benefits of OMT
realize that it can successfully relieve pain and restore mobility.  And by
maintaining proper alignment and structural function, OMT can actually help you
to avoid injury.<p>

OMT used in place of surgery can help you save critical healthcare dollars.  The
use of OMT for prevention of illness or injury can result in long-term savings.

<h2>Proof Positive: OMT Works</h2>
A recent study of acute low back pain revealed that manipulation is an effective
treatment option; similar studies on the use of OMT to treat various disorders,
ranging from migraines to asthma, are currently underway.  Results will quantify
what DOs - and their patients - have known for years:	OMT is effective.  And it can work for you.<p>

<h2>A History of Hands-On Healing</h2>

The earliest medical writings from centuries past describe the efficacy of
manual medicine.  In 1874, osteopathic medicine's founder, Dr. A.T. Still,
recognized the power of hands-on care and incorporated it into his philosophy of
medicine.  Dr. Still identified the musculoskeletal system as a key element of
health; he recognized the body's self-healing capacity; he emphasized
prevention, exercise and keeping fit; and he identified palpation and human
touch as vital and less intrusive elements of diagnosis and treatment.  As the
impressive growth of osteopathic medicine demonstrates, Dr. Still's founding
tenets have withstood the test of time and scientific scrutiny.<p>

<h2>Osteopathic Medical Education</h2>

DOs complete four years of medical training at one of the nation's fully
accredited colleges of osteopathic medicine.  The osteopathic curriculum is
intensive and broad-based.  It includes comprehensive training in the
musculoskeletal system and use of OMT.  Manipulation combined with the
osteopathic philosophies of holistic care, prevention and primary care makes
osteopathic medicine unique.<p>

Upon graduation from medical school, DOs complete a one-year internship,
rotating through all areas of primary care.  Then, they may complete a residency
in any of more than 120 specialty and subspecialty areas of medicine.  Sixty-
four percent of all DOs remain in primary care practices, however, in keeping
with the osteopathic philosophy of holistic medicine.<p>

<H2>What is a DO?</H2>

<P><B>DOs are complete physicians, licensed to perform surgery, prescribe
medication, and specialize in all areas of medicine, from neurosurgery
to psychiatry. They incorporate non-invasive therapies into their spectrum
of care, enabling them to provide the most comprehensive treatment available.
There are nearly 40,000 DOs in the U.S. today.</B> 

<H2><B>The DO Difference</B></H2>

<P><B>DOs stress preventive medicine and offer a complete approach to care,
treating the body as an integrated whole. They consider heredity, job and
home environments, diet, and exercise, and take time to explain how lifestyle
can affect your health. And DOs believe that listening is critical to effective
diagnosis and treatment.</B> 

<P><B>DOs receive training in the musculoskeletal system, and may utilize
osteopathic manipulation as a non-invasive means of diagnosing and treating
illness and injury, while encouraging your body's tendency toward good
health.</B> 

<P><B>Isn't it time you realized the DO difference? For more information
or to locate a DO in your area, please refer to the following guide. State
associations, foundations, and colleges, plus their locations and phone
numbers are listed for your convenience. Some states may be found in the
regional guide at the back of this brochure.</B>

<center><table width=85%><tr><td><b>
Osteopathic medicine is emerging as one of our nation's fastest growing healthcare professions.  And with good reason.  Because of their commitment to primary care and prevention, osteopathic physicians (DOs) are becoming the physicians of choice for more and more people.</td><td><img src="01ome.jpg"></td></tr></table></center>


<p><b>

Osteopathic medicine emphasizes the inter-relationship of the body's nerves, muscles, bones and organs.  The osteopathic philosophy of treating the whole person is applied to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness, disease and injury.<P>

Osteopathic physicians provide complete medical care to millions of people
throughout the United States.  DOs are trained in family practice and many receive additional training in specialty areas such as psychiatry, pediatrics, obstetrics, surgery, ophthalmology and cardiology.<p>

<center><img src="rule.gif"></center><p>

<h2>Preparing for Admission</h2>

To be considered for admission to any of the nation's osteopathic medical
schools, applicants typically have a bachelor's degree, with undergraduate studies that include one year each of English, biological sciences, physics, general chemistry and organic chemistry.  Other requirements may include genetics, mathematics, and psychology.  Most prospective DO students major in sciences with an emphasis in biology or chemistry; however, applicants may major in any discipline as long as they meet the minimum course and grade requirements.  Applicants must also take the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT).<p>

<center><table><tr><td><img src="02ome.jpg"></td><td><b>
Osteopathic medicine is a people-oriented profession that demands dedicated and
empathetic individuals.  Prospective osteopathic medical students must exhibit
a genuine concern for people.  Applicants may wish to spend some time with a
DO or do volunteer work in a healthcare setting before considering a career
in this field.  Osteopathic medical colleges require a personal interview to
assess an applicant's desire to become an osteopathic physician.
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>

For a catalog of requirements and information, contact any of the osteopathic
medical schools listed <A HREF="colleges.htm">here</a>.<p>

<center><img src="rule.gif"></center><p>

<h2>The Osteopathic Curriculum</h2>

The first two years of the osteopathic medical curriculum focus on basic
sciences.  The third and fourth years emphasize clinical work, with much of
the teaching in community hospitals, major medical centers and doctors'
offices.<p>

During the clinical years, students study general medicine and are involved in
research.  They rotate through urban, suburban and rural settings, gaining exposure to all areas of medicine.<p>

Osteopathic principles and practices, which emphasize the relationship
between body systems, are integrated into the four-year curriculum.
Students learn osteopathic manipulative treatment for prevention, diagnosis
and treatment of disease.<p>

<Center><img src="rule.gif"></center><p>

<h2>Postdoctoral Training & Licensure</h2>

Following graduation, DOs complete an approved 12-month internship.  Interns 
rotate through hospital departments including internal medicine, family practice 
and surgery.  Many may then choose to complete a residency program in a specialty area, requiring two to six years of additional training.<p>

DOs are licensed for the full practice of medicine and surgery in all 50 states.  Each state determines the tests and procedures for licensing its physicians.  In 
some states, the same tests are given to DOs and MDs; other states administer separate licensing exams.<p>

<Center><img src="rule.gif"></center><p>

<h2>Continuing Medical Education</h2>

Continuing Medical Education is a lifetime commitment to learning by osteopathic physicians who recognize that the study of medicine does not end with completion of medical school.  The American Osteopathic Association requires its members to earn a specified number of continuing medical education credits every three years in order to maintain membership.<p>

<font size=+2>introduction</font><br>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>

As of 1994, 51% of insured Americans (92 million of 181 million,
including dependents) received health care through managed care 
organizations.&#185;  Enrollment increased 14-fold from 1989 to 
1994.&#178;  It has been estimated that by 1997, 85% of the
population will be covered by managed care.  Because of this 
explosive growth, it is vital that osteopathic physicians be
proactive with regard to participation in managed care organizations.<p>

Primary care physicians play a critical role in the delivery of
managed health care and the demand for this key player is rapidly
increasing.  Colleges of osteopathic medicine have a strong
tradition of graduating a large percentage of primary care 
physicians -- far more than their allopathic counterparts.  In
1992, only 14% of allopathic medical school graduates chose a
primary care career compared with a consistent rate of about 40%
of osteopathic medical school graduates.&#178;  This creates an
outstanding opportunity for osteopathic physicians to fill a need
and become leaders in this rapidly evolving health care
delivery system.<p>

As leaders in the field, osteopathic physicians will have an
opportunity to impact the design of the system ensuring that 
managed care organizations deliver cost-effective care without
sacrificing quality.  To communicate the high standards of
osteopathic medicine effectively within these organizations,
osteopathic physicians must learn to speak their language.
This page will help you begin that process -- a first step
toward becoming a manager of managed care.<p>

<font size=+2>Types of Managed Care Delivery Systems</font><p>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Health maintenance 
organization (HMO).</font><p>
Provides coverage of agreed-on health services needed by plan 
members for a fixed, prepaid premium. There are four basic models
of HMOs: group model, individual practice association, network model
and staff model.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Group model HMO.</font><p>
Involves contracts with physicians organized in groups who receive 
a fixed payment per patient to provide specific services.  These
physicians usually see only HMO patients.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Individual practice association (IPA) 
model HMO.</font><p>
Involves contracts with independent physicians who work in their 
own private practices and see fee-for-service patients as well as 
HMO enrollees.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Network Model HMO.</font><p>
Involves contracts with multiple physician groups and sometimes with 
multiple specialties. Physicians work in their own offices and may 
also treat fee-for-service patients.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Staff model HMO.</font><p>
Employs physicians to provide health care to its members. The HMO
compensates physicians with salary and incentive programs.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Preferred provider organization 
(PPO).</font><p>
Contracts are established with care-givers referred to as 
preferred providers.  Usually, the benefit contract requires 
significantly less copayment for services received from preferred 
providers to motivate enrollees to use these providers.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Exclusive provider organization 
(EPO).</font><p>
Similar to a preferred provider organization (PPO); however, while 
a PPO provides coverage for non-preferred provider services as well 
as preferred provider services, an EPO only reimburses for services 
rendered by a preferred provider.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Point-of-service (POS) plan.</font><p>
Allows the covered person to decide at the time services are needed 
whether to choose a participating or non-participating provider with 
different benefit levels associated with the use of participating
providers.  There are several ways in which this plan may be delivered:
<UL>
<LI>an HMO may permit limited services from non-participating
providers
<LI>an HMO may offer a supplemental major medical policy to
provide non-participating benefits
<LI>a preferred provider organization (PPO) may be used to provide
both participating and non-participating coverage
<LI>various combinations of the above
</UL>

supplying all health services required by the
covered person under the conditions of a provider contract.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Fee maximum.</font><p>
The highest amount a provider may be paid for a specific
health care service provided to a covered person based on

fee maximums exist for each procedure.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Prospective reimbursement.</font><p>
Any method of paying hospitals or other health care providers for 
a defined period (usually one year) based on a fixed rate agreed 
upon in advance.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Reasonable and customary (R&C).</font><p>
The commonly charged or prevailing fees for health services within 
a specific geographic region. A fee is deemed reasonable if it 
falls within the limits of the average or commonly charged fee 
for that service within that specific community.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Resource based relative value 
scale (RBRVS).</font><p>

to provide health care to Medicare enrollees based on reasonable
cost or prudent buyer concepts.  Based on estimated costs, the 
plan periodically receives a capitated amount, which may be 
adjusted later to reflect actual cost.  Expenses are audited at
the end of the contract to determine the final rate the plan
should have been paid.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Health care prepayment plan (HCPP).</font><p>
A cost contract with Health Care Financing Administration that prepays 
a health plan a flat amount per month to provide Medicare-eligible Part B

An agreement between the Health Care Financing Administration and
a managed care plan requiring the plan to supply all Medicare-covered
services to Medicare-eligible enrollees at a predetermined monthly
payment rate from the government and a monthly premium rate paid by
the enrollee.  The managed care plan is then liable for services
regardless of their scope or cost.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Hold harmless clause.</font><p>
There are two types of hold harmless clause.  The first type involves
a physician's agreement not to pursue a patient for fees in excess of
those allowed in an HMO contract.  In the second type of hold harmless
clause, the physician agrees not to sue the managed care organization
for its contribution on a liability claim.<p>

<h2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></h2>

<p>
This edition of the CME Guide includes certain changes in the requirements, guidelines and procedures of the American Osteopathic Association's program on continuing medical education effective as of January 1, 1995.

<p>
These changes reflect both experiences accumulated by the Council on CME in administering the program since it was initiated on June 1, 1973, as well as many specific recommendations made by those participating in the program.

<p>
While the objectives of the CME program remain the same, these changes are intended to simplify administrative procedures and make all requirements, guidelines and procedures more easily understood.

<p>
This document is designed to serve as a handy reference which should answer most, but probably not all, questions concerning the CME program.  It can serve its intended purpose, however, only if it is read thoroughly, its contents absorbed, and then referred to as specific questions arise.  The special summary found on the center pages should be particularly helpful in answering the most common questions.

<p>
The Council welcomes comments and suggestions from all individuals and organizations participating in the program.  These should be directed to the Division of CME, American Osteopathic Association, 142 E. Ontario Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611.

<H3 ALIGN=Center>AOA succeeds in passing Medicaid legislation recognizing AOA board certification</H3><BR>
<p>
The AOA claimed a major victory on September 27, when the US Congress unanimously passed the Medicaid Certification Act of 1996 (H.R. 1791). H.R. 1791 corrects a provision in Medicaid law (OBRA '90) which ultimately established criteria physicians would have to meet to treat Medicaid recipients who are pregnant women and children. One of the requirements in the statute was that physicians must hold allopathic (MD) board certification. The approval of H.R. 1791 includes osteopathic board certification, which is a vital element of the bill because it ensures that DOs certified by the AOA can continue to treat this particular group of Medicaid patients.<p>

Prior to President Clinton's signing of the bill, the AOA had spent the past six years persuading Congress to correct the error on OBRA '90. The AOA began its final push to pass the bill on Sept. 13, when  the AOA urged members of the House Commerce Committee to review the bill along with other Medicaid technical corrections bills that were under discussion by the committee. The bill reached the House floor on Sept. 19 and the Senate on Sept. 24. The bill was officially signed into law by President Clinton on October 9. <p>

Along with his appointment Lt. Gen. Blanck was also promoted to the rank of lieutenant general.
</b></font></td></tr></table>


Lieutenant General Ronald R. Blanck, U.S. Army, DO, a board certified osteopathic physician, was sworn in as the 39th surgeon general of the Army and was promoted to the three-star rank of lieutenant general on October 1.<p>

A 1967 graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Dr. Blanck is currently the commander of Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the North Atlantic Regional Medical Command. As the Army's surgeon general, he will also command the U.S. Army Medical Command at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The medical command operates eight medical centers, nearly 30 community hospitals, as well as research and teaching institutions around the world.<p>

Entering the Army in 1968, Dr. Blanck was assigned as a general medical officer in Vietnam. Following an assignment as a general medical officer at Fort Myer, Dr. Blanck completed a residency in internal medicine at Walter Reed in 1973. He went on to serve as assistant chief of the general medicine service and as the assistant chief in the department of medicine at Walter Reed. Later assignments included serving as assistant dean of student affairs at Uniformed Services University School of Medicine; chief of the department of medicine at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston; and chief of the medical corps career activities office in the office of the surgeon general. Dr. Blanck also served as commander of the Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center in Frankfurt, Germany and as the director of professional services and chief of medical corps affairs in the office of the surgeon general. <p>

<H3 ALIGN=Center>AOA, ACOOG unveil "A Woman's Guide to Managed Care"</H3>

In an effort to educate women about managed care and help them make informed healthcare decisions for themselves and their families, the AOA has teamed up with the American College of Osteopathic Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOOG) to produce a comprehensive presentation, "A Woman's Guide To Managed Care."<p>

The presentation kit and brochure will provide a step-by-step guide on selecting a managed care plan, from teaching women how to evaluate a managed care organization (MCO), to suggesting key questions they should ask about covered services and providers.<p>

<img src="woman.gif" ALIGN=right>

A ready-to-use presentation kit will be available from the AOA to DOs who wish to address local women's groups. The $45 kit will include a script, 35 mm slides, and brochures. Physicians using the materials will be enhancing their practice visibility and promoting the osteopathic medical profession as well as delivering important information.<p>

A Woman's Guide to Managed Care" brochures will join the AOA's literature series and will be available through the AOA Order Department for $25/100. The brochures will also discuss the benefits of osteopathic medical care.<p>

The development of the presentation kit and brochure come at an ideal time, according to James E. Zini, DO, chairman of the AOA Committee on Public Relations. "Today, more people than ever before receive medical coverage through managed care plans. The understanding of how plans operate, what benefits and services they provide, and how well they respond to their enrollees is vital. The presentation program is of special significance to women, who are often the primary healthcare decision-makers for their families," Dr. Zini said.<p>

"A Woman's Guide to Managed Care" was developed by members of the ACOOG Ad Hoc Committee on Health Promotion for Women in conjunction with the AOA Committee on Public Relations. <p>

<H3 ALIGN=Center>DOs staff national health hotline during convention Dial-A-DO</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=Center>Publicity reaches 11 million Americans</H4>

Hypertension and pregnancy. Cancer and the common cold. Whatever the question, 68 DOs were on hand with answers during the 2nd annual Dial-A-DO, held at the AOA's 101st Annual Convention and Scientific Seminar in Las Vegas last October.<p>

<table align=left width=33%><tr><td>

<font size=-1><b>
AOA trustee, Captain Michael Murphy, DO, MC, answered health-related questions from callers across the country during the second annual Dial-A-DO. More than 1,500 called in to Dial-A-DO over the course of the two-day program.
</b></font></td></tr></table>

The two-day hotline offered people across the nation an opportunity to speak directly to a physician for information on their health or osteopathic medicine. While DOs did not diagnose by phone, they answered health questions and even directed several callers to emergency rooms for immediate treatment.<p>

More than 1,500 people throughout America took advantage of the health hotline, which accepted calls for 12 hours each day. The largest volume of calls (542) came from Illinois, with California (288) dialing in at number two.<p>

DO volunteers completed data sheets for every caller, recording the question(s) asked; age/gender of callers; and their location. Callers were also asked where they heard about the program. The data will help the AOA department of communications develop a bigger and better program for 1997, and will also help to identify typical health concerns.<p>

What did callers want to know? Nearly 10 percent of all calls pertained to musculoskeletal problems. Others asked questions about reproduction/sexual health; many were concerned about wellness, nutrition and exercise, and others inquired about the common cold. Many callers wanted to learn more about osteopathic medicine and requested a DO in their area.<p>

Evaluation of the caller sheets revealed some interesting data as well: The average age of callers was 49. The youngest caller was 11 while the oldest caller was 87. In addition, more women than men called the hotline.<p>

Dial-A-DO was promoted on radio, television and in newspapers across the country. In addition, the AOA distributed more than 15,000 promotional flyers, and mailed toy cellular phones bearing a message to 250 top media outlets.<p>

</b></font></td></tr></table>

While final usage reports have not yet been received, the program thus far has generated nearly 11 million audience impressions.<p>

One promotional vehicle was a video news release (VNR) package featuring AOA president John P. Sevastos, DO and Dial-A-DO volunteer, M. Jay Porcelli, DO, a California-based family physician. The piece included information about Dial-A-DO and osteopathic physicians; it appeared on newscasts in Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, Phoenix, and Greensboro, N.C.<p>

News releases were distributed to over 5,000 papers nation-wide, with placements in publications including <I>The Daily Oklahoman</I> (Oklahoma City, Okla.); <I>Journal</I> (Albuquerque, NM); <I>Daily Bulletin</I> (Ontario, Calif.); <I>Democrat</I> (Tallahassee, Fla.) <I>Labor Paper</I> (Kenosha, Wis.) and <I>Parent Guide</I> magazine. <p>

DOs staffed the phone lines in two hour shifts, working in a specially constructed lucite walled room on the convention's exhibit floor. In all, 84 shifts were filled, with many DOs volunteering additional hours. Participants received a "Dial-A-DO" t-shirt and an AOA coffee mug in recognition for their support of the program. Their volunteer efforts were also promoted via news releases sent to their hometown papers and affiliate organizations.<p>

Dial-A-DO is sponsored by SmithKline Beecham as part of the "Osteopathic Medicine's Caring Cooperative" initiative. <p>

For two days of the AOA's 101st Annual Convention and Scientific Seminar in Las Vegas, 56 DOs participated in the AOA's radio interviews. The efforts of the osteopathic physicians that participated in the program resulted in the 1996 AOA radio interviews reaching a total audience of nearly 93 million.<p>

Speakers and leaders were interviewed by a professional broadcaster on subjects ranging from back pain to drug abuse among teenagers. Osteopathic physicians were able to discuss their topic with the broadcaster prior to the interview to ensure that they would be able to focus on the key points of the topic during the actual interview.  The entire process took each physician approximately ten minutes. Once the interviews were completed, they were sent to individual and network stations of each participating physician. Interviews aired on a total of 2,436 stations, including nine regional networks and four national networks. <p>

<H3  ALIGN=Center>AOA takes part in National High Blood Pressure Education Program</H3>

The National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) Coordinating Committee has issued a call for action to health professionals, patients, and the public to do more to detect, treat and control high blood pressure especially in older Americans. William A. Nickey, DO, FACOI, representing the AOA on the NHBPEP coordinating committee&#151;a body of 45 professional, voluntary, and Federal health agencies said, "the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reports that, of those age 70 or older, only 19 percent of white women and 16 percent of white men are controlling their blood pressure. In the same age group, African Americans do somewhat better (23 percent of women and 25 percent of men), but only 7 percent of Mexican American women and 12 percent of Mexican American men are controlling their blood pressure to below 140/90 mm Hg." <p>

<b>Communications Efforts</b><p>

With many changes taking place in the health care delivery system,
now more than ever, DOs need a unified voice to speak for them
on issues of national importance.  The AOA Communications
Department has taken significant action to promote and preserve
the practice rights of DOs. Efforts focus on educating key
decision makers in government, managed care plans, and third party
payors about the benefits of osteopathic care.  The Communications
Department also works with the AOA Washington Office to guarantee
visibility for the profession with government policy makers.  The
AOA is also very successful at placing information about DOs in
media targeted to health care consumers.  Many of these activities
are highlighted in <I>For AOA Members Only</I>, a quarterly 
newsletter specially designed to keep members informed of issues
important to osteopathic physicians.<p>

<b>Government Relations</b><p>

The AOA Department of Government Relations represents the
interests of the nation's DOs to federal and state government
officials, both in the legislative and executive branches.  In
promoting the osteopathic medical profession, the Department of
Government Relations has been successful in expanding the profile
of the profession with Members of Congress, providing testimony at
Congressional committee hearings, providing input on White House
health care initiatives, and securing DO representation on
several state licensure boards.<p>

<UL>
<LI><b>National - Washington, DC</b>--The Washington office is 
responsible for securing recognition of
Osteopathic Medicine at the national level.  In this office,
efforts to work with Members of Congress, White House staff and
health agency officials takes priority.  Recently the Washington
office played a critical role in obtaining several osteopathic
friendly amendments in the balanced budget act.  For further
information or questions, call (800) 962-9008.<p>

<LI><b>State</b>--The State Government Relations 
Department, located in the Chicago office, works with 
state osteopathic associations and DOs in all 50 states 
to protect the profession's practice rights.  It also
educates public policy makers as to the contributions of
osteopathic physicians and surgeons to a vital health care system
in their respective state.  The office is also responsible for the
compilation of all states' licensing requirements for osteopathic
physicians.  For further information or questions, call
(800) 621-1773 ext. 7441.<p>

<LI><b>Emerging States</b>--The AOA created three regional 
offices to act as a liaison to those states with emerging DO 
populations.  The Northeast, Southeast, and Northwest regions 
are administered by an AOA Regional Manager.<p>
</UL>

<b>Education</b><p>

The Education Department at the AOA is set up to assure the
highest standards in education, postdoctoral training, and
continuing medical education for osteopathic physicians.  The
Education Department is divided into six divisions:<br>
<ul><li>Predoctoral Education
<li>Research
<li>Postdoctoral Training
<li>Certification
<li>Continuing Medical Education
<li>Hospital Accreditation
</ul>


<b>Predoctoral Education</b><p>

The Division of Predoctoral Education provides staff support to

the public at large.  To request information about the college

<b>Research</b><p>

The AOA has devoted significant resources to expand and develop new avenues
for osteopathic research.  The AOA Bureau of Research has supported the
development of the first textbook on OPP/OMT to be used in osteopathic
medical schools, the development of research training programs for
osteopathic physicians who are in the early stages of their careers as
clinical researchers, and studies that will increase the widespread
acceptance and use of OMT in the health care system.  The AOA Bureau of
Research also sponsors an annual research conference held in conjunction
with the AOA Annual Convention.  For information, please call 
(800) 621-1773 ext. 7447 or 5874.<p>

<b>Postdoctoral</b><p>

The Division of Postdoctoral Training of the AOA approves postdoctoral
training programs offered by AOA-accredited hospitals and medical schools.
Completion of such training programs leads to certification in a variety
of medical specialties.  DOs who pursue ACGME-accredited residency
training may request AOA approval of their chosen programs.  For
information about osteopathic internships and residencies, call 
(800) 621-1773 ext. 5844; to request approval of ACGME-accredited 
training, call ext. 5856 or 5888.<p>

<b>AOA CME Registry Services</b><p>

As a service to members, the CME Division of the American Osteopathic
Association records the CME activity of each DO and prepares
complimentary biannual reports (non members pay $350).  These CME reports
are valuable in seeking, renewing or expanding hospital privileges and
maintaining state licensure, and assists DOs in keeping organized and
accurate records of CME fulfillment.  For information regarding your CME
activity, call the CME Division at (800) 621-1773 ext. 7439.<p>

<b>Specialty Board Certification</b><p>

The AOA is the only national accrediting body with programs leading
to the certification of osteopathic physicians.  The Bureau of 
Osteopathic Specialists establishes and maintains standards of 
specialization and training for the various osteopathic specialty
areas.  Currently, osteopathic physicians can be certified in more 
than 100 specialties and subspecialties.  For more information about 
specific requirements for various certifying boards or board eligibility, 
call (800) 621-1773 ext. 7445.<p>

<b>Hospital Accreditation</b><p>

The hospital accreditation program of the AOA is recognized 
nationally by federal and state governments and various 
insurance carriers as holding "Deemed Status" to conduct
accreditation surveys of acute care hospitals.  This 
designation means that hospitals accredited by the AOA are 
deemed to comply with the Medicare Conditions of Participation
for Hospitals as published by the Health Care Financing 
Administration (HCFA).  Hospitals accredited by the AOA are, 
therefore, eligible to receive Medicare funds for the care of 
qualified patients.  The program also has "deemed status" to 
accredit hospital laboratories under the Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA).  For information, please 
call (800) 621-1773 ext. 7449 or 5849.<p>

<b>Payor Relations</b><p>

The AOA's division of Payor Relations promotes recognition of 
osteopathic credentialing leading toward inclusion in managed 
care plans.  The Payor Relations Division also assists members 
in issues related to resolving problems in coding and reimbursement 
for services.<p>

The AOA is also planning to offer regional coding seminars and is 
involved in updating relative work values of physician services 
through the multi-specialty RUC process.<p>

<H2>AOA embarks on three initiatives for graduate medical education</h2>
</center>
<p>


The AOA has embarked on three initiatives to address graduate medical education (GME) 
financing and resulting physician workforce issues.
<p>
Because the federal government is trying to curb healthcare expenditures, it comes as 
no surprise that GME monies are in jeopardy. The AOA is working to ensure that quality, 
cost-effective healthcare is available to all people by promoting the value of 
osteopathic medical education and training programs to key policymakers. In addition, 
the AOA is working to assist policymakers in developing appropriate national physician 
workforce and training policies.

</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>

<img src="opipari.gif" align=right>


To this end, the AOA will testify before the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC) 
in mid-December on the value of medical education and training consortia, such as the 
Osteopathic Postdoctoral Training Institutions (OPTIs). Michael Opipari, DO, chairman of 
the AOA's Council on Postdoctoral Training, will testify on the AOA's behalf in an 
attempt to gain the PPRC's support for the consortia concept as illustrated by the OPTI 
program. Such support would be extremely helpful when the AOA promotes the OPTI concept 
to Congress next year.
<p>


Second, the AOA is participating in a profession-wide task force on osteopathic GME.  As 
reported in the October issue of Government News Line, the AOA Board of Trustees at its 
October meeting approved a resolution submitted by the AOA Council on Federal Health 
Programs that called for the establishment of an Osteopathic GME Task Force with 
representatives from the AOA, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic 
Medicine (AACOM) and the American Osteopathic Healthcare Association. The purpose of 
this task force is to develop policy, respond to reform proposals, and act as a resource 
for staff as they respond to proposals from legislators and academia. The first meeting 
of the task force is scheduled to occur sometime in January via conference call.
<p>

Third, the AOA is engaged in dialogue with representatives of the American Medical 
Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, AACOM, the Association of 
Academic Health Centers and the National Medical Association to develop consensus on 
general medical education and training policy. If the "House of Medicine" can reach 
consensus on this issue,  the AOA's job on Capitol Hill next year will be much easier. A 
draft consensus document will be the basis of a public forum in early December, during 
which medical associations will testify in support of, or against, the principles of 
reform included in the document. After the public forum, the aforementioned groups will 
determine if consensus among the members of the "House of Medicine" exists. If consensus 
does exist, a press conference will be held sometime during the beginning of the 105th 
Congress to promote the reform plan. 
<p>

All of these three initiatives will lay a strong foundation of advocacy for the 
osteopathic medical education continuum in the 105th Congress.

<h2>From our chairmen:</h2>

<p><img src="thomas.gif" align=right>


The issue of physicians administering treatment to patients suffering from intractable 
pain was a main topic of discussion at the October meeting of the Bureau of State 
Government Affairs. The treatment of patients with intractable pain, in particular, the 
treatment of individuals suffering from a terminal illness, has been a growing concern 
to the public and medical profession.  

<p>
At the meeting, the Bureau heard testimony from AOA Ethics Committee Chairman, Donald J. 
Krpan, DO, in support of state legislation to protect physicians from disciplinary 
actions for prescribing or administrating controlled substances to patients with 
intractable pain.  With the help of AOA state executive directors, the Bureau 
has identified ten states that are expected to take legislative action on this issue in 
1997.  The Bureau and the Ethics Committee have recently forwarded their findings on 
intractable pain to the AOA's Trustees with a recommendation that the AOA adopt an 
official policy in support of intractable pain legislation.

<p>
In addition, the Bureau voted to adopt the Agenda  '96 - '97 proposal as submitted to 
the Bureau at the October meeting. This document will be used as a guide for the 
Division of State Government Relations activities over the next 12 months. 
<p>
<hr width=33%>
<p><img src="oliva.gif" align=left>
Now that the 104th Congress and the 1996 presidential and congressional elections are 
behind us, the Council on Federal Health Programs is gearing up for its legislative 
efforts in the 105th Congress. 
<p>
As reported previously, the osteopathic medical profession had a major victory at the 
adjournment of the Congress with the passage of the Medicaid Osteopathic Certification 
Act of 1996, but the legislators fell short of enacting any broad healthcare reforms. 
The Kennedy/Kassebaum legislation provides a good framework for additional health 
insurance reforms, but there is no such framework in place for the healthcare financing 
and delivery reforms that are so necessary.
<p>
Since there will again be a Democratic administration working with a Republican- 
controlled Congress, I believe we will hear the same discussions and debates on 
healthcare issues such as oversight for managed care organizations, physician workforce 
policy, graduate medical education financing and  medical liability reform. As we saw in 
the 104th Congress, many of these debates ended up in partisan gridlock.  How then will 
we overcome such gridlock in the 105th session?  I believe that members of the medical 
profession, working together, can develop strong advocacy groups that can influence the 
Congress. Advocacy groups are already beginning to form that will act to protect the 
interests of the osteopathic medical profession and promote much-needed healthcare 
reforms. The Council on Federal Health Programs Agenda '97 will reflect this advocacy 
philosophy. I look forward to sharing the Agenda with all of you in late January after 
the Council's first meeting.

<h2>AAOE discusses status of NBOME</h2>
<I>by Robert W. Foster, DO, AAOE President</I>
<br><p>
The status of the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) exam was the 
main topic of discussion at the October meeting of the American Association of 
Osteopathic Examiners (AAOE) in Las Vegas. 

<p>
Representatives from at least 12 licensing boards attending the meeting, along with  
representatives from the American Osteopathic Association, the Bureau of State 
Government Affairs (BSGA), the NBOME and the American Association of Colleges of 
Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM). Gerald Osborn, DO, vice president of the NBOME, said they 
are currently introducing Step 2 of COMLEX, which replaces Part II of the NBOME exam. 
The NBOME is also in the process of developing an osteopathic version of the Federation 
of State Medical Board's (FSMB) Special Purpose Examination (SPEX). This new 
examination, which would include osteopathic principles and practices, would enable 
state licensing boards to adequately test the proficiency of osteopathic physicians who 
have been out of medical school for five or more years. 
<p>
The NBOME has also contacted the FSMB about appointing an FSMB representative to serve 
on the NBOME Liaison Committee. In addition, the NBOME is writing an article on COMLEX-
USA for the FSMB's Bulletin, which should be published in time for the FSMB's annual 
meeting in April.
<p>
Douglas L. Wood, DO, PhD, AACOM president, said that there was close to unanimous 
support among the colleges of osteopathic medicine to require the NBOME for graduation. 
Currently, 13 of the 16 colleges require students to sit for Part 1, nine colleges 
require students to sit for Part 2 or Step II (which implies the passage of Part 1), and 
four colleges require passage of Part 1 and either passage of Part 2 or Step II.  Dr. 
Wood noted that AACOM would like the COMLEX exam schedule to be reconsidered. The NBOME 
agreed to look at rescheduling exam dates if it would be helpful to the colleges. 
Attendees were also updated on the efforts of the AOA in securing recognition of the 
NBOME in Louisiana, licensing changes in Texas and the new Federation Credential 
Verification Service (see story on page 5).
<p>
Linda Mascheri, assistant director of AOA State Government Relations, researched state 
medical practice acts to ascertain which states have acts that contain appropriate 
language with regard to the osteopathic medical profession. She then compiled a handout 
on acceptable medical practice language for osteopathic medical education, GME, 
examination sequence, specialty board certification and CME.  This information will give 
the AAOE a starting point for developing "model osteopathic language" for inclusion in 
state medical practice acts.  
<p>
Dates for the AAOE's 1997 Summit meeting will be discussed at the next AAOE meeting, 
which will be held in conjunction with the FSMB's  annual meeting in San Diego. The 
tentative date for the AAOE meeting is Wednesday, April 16. An announcement of the time 
and location of the meeting will be mailed to all AAOE members prior to the FSMB 
meeting.  Anticipated topics for the AAOE meeting include the candidates who are 
nominated for FSMB offices, the development of strategies to help promote osteopathic 
representation within the FSMB and planning for the 1997 Summit meeting.  
<p>
Bill McCord, DO, an FSMB board member who sits on the Tennessee Board of Osteopathic 
Examiners, will be running for re-election to the FSMB board for a three-year term and 
needs the support of DOs at the upcoming FSMB meeting.  Dr. McCord has also been 
appointed to fill a newly created position on the AOA's Bureau of State Government 
Affairs, in which he represents the AAOE as a voting member. This appointment 
demonstrates the AOA's support for the involvement of the AAOE in state government 
affairs.
<p>
Anyone interested in running for an FSMB office or serving on an FSMB committee should 
contact Linda Mascheri at (800) 621-1773,  ext. 3652, or Robert Foster, DO, AAOE 
president, at (304) 647-6290.

<h2>FCC committee addresses telemedicine needs of rural health facilities</h2>
<p>
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Telecommunications and Health Care Advisory 
Committee made public in November their recommendations to the FCC concerning the rural 
telemedicine provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other telemedicine 
issues.
<p>
The recommendations, which focused  primarily on the communication needs of providers in 
rural areas, include the following: that rural health facilities be given the financial 
support to develop an adequate infrastructure to implement telemedicine, that standards 
be established to ensure interoperability among networks with different technologies and 
equipment and that access to the Internet be made available at the same cost as in urban 
areas. The Committee stated that both the federal government and the states should 
assist in funding  infrastructure development and subsidizing cost differentials between 
rural and urban markets for access to telecommunications providers.
<p>
The Committee also touched upon telemedicine in the international arena.  Members of the 
committee identified many of the barriers to international telemedicine implementation, 
including access at a reasonable rate, availability of capital, varying licensure 
requirements, incompatibility of systems, and scarcity of healthcare professionals 
abroad, but did not make any recommendations  on how to address these barriers. The 
Committee, however, did recommend the establishment of a working group composed of 
representatives from federal agencies and the private sector to help promote 
telemedicine abroad.
<p>
If you would like additional information or have questions concerning telemedicine, 
please call Keith Brin, legislative analyst, AOA State Government Relations, at (312) 
280-3653 or (800) 621-1773, ext. 3653.

<h2>DOs are lowest-cost providers in Colorado</h2>
<p>
A recent study conducted by the actuarial firm Milliman & Robertson in Colorado shows 
that DOs are the lowest cost providers of workers' comp healthcare services in the state 
among chiropractors, MDs, mental health providers and physical therapists as a function 
of average cost per claim. The study was commissioned by the Colorado Division of 
Insurance for claims closed in 1995. This is the fifth consecutive year the study has 
been conducted.

<h2>Two major HMOs remove gag clauses from contracts</h2>
<p>

Humana Inc., based in Louisville, Ky., recently decided to remove language from its 
contracts with 40,000 physicians nationwide that physicians say prevented them from 
discussing all available treatment options with patients. United Healthcare Corp., based 
in Minneapolis, is also removing so-called "gag-clauses" from their provider contracts 
and says it is adding contract language that will encourage physicians to discuss all 
treatment options with patients, even those treatments that are not covered as a 
benefit.
<p>
The American Association of Health Plans (AAHP), a Washington association representing 
HMOs, expects other HMOs to follow suit. "We expect that other HMO plans will move in a 
similar direction as Humana," says Donald White, an AAHP spokesperson. Sixteen states 
have passed legislation banning gag clauses, and 14 states plan to introduce 
similar measures.

<h2>FSMB launches credentialing service</h2>

<p>
 The Federation Credentials Verification Service (FCVS) will contract with individual 
licensing boards (allopathic or osteopathic) to verify the core credential documents  
necessary for physician licensure, which include physician biographical information, 
medical education, including medical school transcripts, graduate medical education and 
verification of the physician examination sequence. The core credential information will 
be used by state medical boards to assist in evaluating physicians for initial 
licensure, reactivation/reinstatement of licensure or licensure by endorsement. 
Physicians must provide their written consent to obtain documents from the FCVS and must 
pay an initial fee to initiate the core credentialing process (see box).  Subsequent  
credentialing requests will be processed at a substantially reduced rate.  
<p>
Although the AOA believes that the FCVS  provides a worthwhile service, the AOA does not 
endorse the use of the FCVS as a requirement for physicians who wish  to petition for 
licensure.  The AOA endorses the use of the FCVS as an option for credential 
verification.
<p>
The state licensing boards of Utah, Ohio and Wyoming have already signed contracts with 
the FCVS as part of an FCVS pilot program, and Georgia, Maryland and Virginia are 
expected to sign up for  the credentialing service by the end of the year. Fourteen 
other state boards have agreed to accept FCVS-verified documents, but will not require 
them for physician licensure. At the request of the AOA, the Utah Osteo-pathic Board of 
Medical Examiners has agreed to make the use of the FCVS an option as opposed to a 
requirement for licensure. The state's allopathic board, however, will require MDs to 
use the FCVS.
<p>
The State Medical Board of Ohio has published a proposed amendment stating that all 
physicians applying for a Ohio license be required to use the FCVS.  The AOA wrote a 
letter to the board  stating that physicians petitioning for a license in Ohio should 
have a choice to use or not use the FCVS. The Ohio licensing board subsequently 
scheduled a hearing for Nov. 14. The AOA also contacted the Wyoming Board of Medicine, 
which has not signed up with the credentialing service and has yet to indicate whether 
they will require physicians in the state to use the FCVS.
<p>
The AOA will continue to monitor the progress of the FCVS.  If you would like additional 
information, please contact Linda Mascheri, assistant director, AOA State Government 
Relations, at (800) 621-1773, ext. 3652.

<h2>Louisiana Medical Society calls for action by LBME</h2>
<p>

In response to the Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners' (LBME) refusal to accept the 
National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiner's (NBOME) exam as a pathway for the 
licensure of DOs in the state, the Louisiana Medical Society's House of Delegates is 
calling for the LBME to  review the NBOME exam.
<p>
At the Louisiana Medical Society's recent House of Delegates meeting in Shreveport, a 
representative of the LBME presented arguments as to why it is holding firm in 
supporting the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) as the only pathway 
for licensure in the state. The representative also chastised the medical society's 
board of governors for supporting the NBOME and challenged the society to put the issue 
to a vote of their House of Delegates. Louisiana Osteopathic Medical Association 
President Nancy Bellemare, DO, corrected several misstatements made by the 
representative about the NBOME and, in particular, challenged the LBME to substantiate 
its charges regarding DO pass/fail rates on the USMLE. The Louisiana Medical Society 
then called for a vote by their House of Delegates on their Board of Governors' 
recommendation that the state licensing board review the NBOME exam to determine its 
validity as a tool for measuring the medical competence of osteopathic physiciansa 
review the LBME has refused to undertake. The House of Delegates voted unanimously to 
accept the recommendation.
<p>
The House and Senate Health Committees of the state legislature scheduled a joint 
hearing for Nov. 12 to discuss the licensing issue. The AOA will testify that the LBME 
is not operating in the best interests of the citizens of Louisiana and will ask the 
committee to instruct the LBME to accept the NBOME without further delay.

<h2>AOA secures inclusion of osteopathic language in managed care legislation</h2>
<p>

The AOA has secured the inclusion of osteopathic-specific language in recent legislation 
aimed at protecting providers and patients in managed care plans.
<p>
Two weeks before the 104th Congress adjourned, a senior member of the House Ways and 
Means Subcommittee on Health, Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.),  introduced a revised version 
of The Managed Care Consumer Protection Act of 1996 (H.R. 4220) that contains  much of  
the osteopathic language the AOA had desired. The proposed legislation addresses 
provider contracting, utilization review standards and other managed care issues and 
calls for a ban on gag clauses in physician contracts along with proper access to 
emergency medical care, both of which the AOA strongly supports. 
<p>
After thoroughly reviewing the original version of the legislation, which  was 
applicable only to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans, AOA staff met 
with Rep. Stark's chief healthcare advisors to begin a discussion over how the bill 
could be improved. The AOA then seized the opportunity to advocate  the inclusion of 
osteopathic-specific language in the bill. Following weeks of negotiations with Rep. 
Stark's personal and committee staff, the congressman included most of the language 
drafted by AOA staff in the revised version of the bill.  The scope of the bill was also 
expanded to include all persons enrolled in managed care plans.  
<p>
Although the bill did not see action prior to Congress's adjournment, Rep. Stark has 
indicated that he will re-introduce it shortly after the 105th Congress convenes in 
January. The AOA will be working closely with Rep. Stark in the next Congress in an 
effort to put additional osteopathic-specific language into the bill that would prohibit 
a health plan from denying participation privileges to DOs solely on the basis of 
osteopathic training or certification. 	
<p>
The osteopathic-specific provisions currently included in the bill are as follows:
<p>
<center>
<table width=75%><tr><td>
<b>Utilization review</b><p>
" ...  with respect to a decision to deny the provision of medical items, services, or 
procedures, a provider licensed in the same field shall conduct a subsequent review to 
determine the medical appropriateness of such a denial and physicians from the same 
medical branch <b>(allopathic or osteopathic medicine) and specialty (recognized by the 
American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association) shall be 
utilized as needed."</b>
<p>
<hr width=50%><br>

<b>Due process protections for providers</b><p>
"Each plan or issuer shall provide a process under which a provider may request a review 
of the plan's or issuer's decision to terminate or refuse to renew the provider's 
participation agreement.  Such review shall be conducted by a group of individuals the 
majority of whom ... are members of the same profession as the provider who requests the 
review <b>and, for physicians, the same medical branch (allopathic or osteopathic 
medicine)."</b></td></tr></table></center>

<h2>DO promoted to chief medical officer of Office of Minority and Women's Health</h2>
<p>
<img src="joe.gif" align=right>
Joseph Kaczmarczyck, DO, an AOA member, was recently promoted to the position of chief medical officer of the Office of Minority and Women's Health (OMWH) at the Bureau of Primary Health Care. Dr. Kaczmarczyck previously served as an occupational medical consultant at the Bureau and the AOA strongly endorsed his promotion.
<p>
In his new position, Dr. Kaczmarczyck will oversee activities within OMWH aimed at improving the health status of women and minorities and  reducing the disparities in the healthcare provided to these populations. Such activities will involve fostering awareness in healthcare systems nationwide of the unique healthcare needs of  women and minorities, establishing  linkages with private and public sector organizations to promote resource sharing  and developing initiatives to ensure access to affordable, comprehensive and coordinated healthcare.
<p>
Dr. Kaczmarczyck is a commander in the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and has the distinction of being the only PHS medical officer who is board certified and trained in both obstetrics/gynecology and preventive/occupational medicine. He presently retains faculty appointments in ob/gyn and preventive medicine and biometrics at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. He is also a member of the American College of Osteopathic Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOOG) Board of Trustees and chairman of the ACOOG Ad Hoc Committee on Health Promotion for Women.

<h2>AHCPR unveils new program to replace Clinical Practice Guideline Program</h2>

<p>
The Agency for Health Care and Policy Research (AHCPR) announced at its last National Advisory Council  for Health Care Policy, Research and Evaluation meeting that it is replacing its Clinical Practice Guideline Program with the new Evidence-Based Practice Program. A congressional directive calling for the AHCPR to trim its research costs coupled with AHCPR's desired goal of producing more outcomes-based information were the catalysts for launching the new program.
<p>
At the ACHPR meeting, AOA Washington Office staffer Michael Conrad met with Doug Kamerow, MD, director of AHCPR's Office of the Forum, and Carolyn Clancy, MD, director of AHCPR's Primary Care Division, to discuss the status of the unfinished Chronic Pain: Headache clinical practice guideline. The AOA learned that the headache guideline will be published in a new report generated by the Evidence-Based Practice Program. 
<p>
Earlier this year, eight AOA members were chosen by the AHCPR to serve as peer reviewers for the headache guideline. These members are Barbara Briner, DO, Anthony Chila, DO, Gregory Dott, DO, Mitchell Elkiss, DO, Frederick Freitag, DO, R. Michael Gallagher, DO, Harvey Micklin, DO, and Paul Winner, DO.
<p>
The AHCPR told the AOA that all eight of our peer reviewers will be used to evaluate the  draft version of  the Chronic Pain: Headache Evidence-Based Practice Report when it is released next year. The AOA will inform members of  topics for the Evidence-Based Practice Reports when such information is made available by the AHCPR. The AOA will be working closely with the agency to ensure that there is continued input by osteopathic physicians in future Evidence-Based Practice Reports.

As the AOA's 100th president, I have the unique pleasure of leading our organization as it celebrates the 100th anniversary of its founding on April 19. Not only surviving - but thriving - for 100 years is no small feat. And this will be no small celebration. Numerous plans are already in the works, including a commemorative AOA Centennial History magazine. This publication will be an outstanding retrospective that will offer a glimpse into the very first days of the AOA's existence. For osteopathic medical students, this publication will be especially meaningful as it shows the vital role that osteopathic medical students have played in the AOA since its very beginning. An excerpt from the September 1901 <I>Journal of the American Osteopathic Association,</I> which appears in the history magazine, reveals just how important osteopathic medical students were to the conception of the AOA.
<P>

<center><table width=75%><tr><td>
 "...in the autumn of 1896 a move was started among the students at Kirksville to effect an organization. A meeting of students and nearby osteopathists was held on Feb. 6, 1897. Discussion revealed a unanimity of sentiment, and the practical work of perfecting the organization was enthusiastically entered upon. A committee of 16 members, four students from each class, was appointed to formulate a plan of organization. On March 13th the report of this committee was submitted and the constitution of the American Association for the Advancement of Osteopathy was approved by sections, final action being deferred until a later meeting. In the meantime the proposed constitution was sent to all osteopathists and to the other schools, inviting suggestion and cooperation. The committee reported strong endorsement of the plan, and on April 19th a permanent organization was effected."
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>

Throughout 1997, the AOA will see to it that the work of these 16 students is honored with a celebration befitting of an organization that today stands at 24,500 members strong.
<p>

Aside from the AOA Centennial magazine, Centennial banners are currently in production that will be displayed along Michigan Avenue in Chicago, within view of the AOA offices. As the final touches are put on the banners, 3,000 AOA Centennial media kits will be distributed to media outlets, affiliates and key medical associations; and a Centennial news release will be sent to 2,000 top media outlets via newswire. For those "surfing" the Internet, Centennial updates will also appear on the AOA web site. In March, I will personally take part in working with the media through the production of an audio news release. In April, a second news release will be distributed via newswire and the AOA communications department will begin intensive contact with key members of the media. 
<p>

AOA President John P. Sevastos, RPh, DO, FACOFP, examined layouts of the AOA Centennial history magazine during a recent visit to AOA headquarters in Chicago.
</b></font>
</td></tr></table>

Throughout the summer, the AOA will continue to work with the media and members of the AOA will continue to learn about the Centennial through its newsletters as well as <I>The DO</I> magazine. In July, the Centennial banners will adorn Michigan Avenue in time for the annual AOA House of Delegates meeting which will take place in downtown Chicago.
<p>

You can see that there are exciting times for our organization in the months ahead. As you take part in the celebration, please pause for a moment to reflect and think of those 16 students who gathered in Kirksville a century ago. At the time of the AOA's founding, osteopathic medicine was growing rapidly. There were battles with the existing medical profession, legal issues, and the communication amongst osteopathic physicians required the presence of a strong organization. Isn't it amazing what we have in common with 16 osteopathic medical students from a century ago! We all owe a tremendous debt to these students. To fully repay this debt, we must continue to grow; solidify our rightful place as an established form of medicine; make our voice heard in the legal battles; and communicate with our members across the country to see that osteopathic medicine has the organization it desperately needs to continue to survive - and thrive - into our next century.
<p>

<H3>West Virginia Study Reflects DOs Impact in Rural Areas</H3>

As I'm sure you are aware, one of the greatest services provided by osteopathic physician is our ability to provide medial care in the rural, under served areas of the country. Reinforcing this fact about osteopathic medicine is the 1996 annual report from the West Virginia Rural Health Education Partnerships (WVRHEP). According to the report, students from the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine (WVSOM) served more than 170 rotations totaling 852 weeks at the WVRHEP consortiums across the state. Also, WVSOM students served 313 rotations for a total of 1,434 weeks at other rural sites in West Virginia. These statistics were compiled from June 1, 1995 - May 31, 1996.
<p>

WVSOM president Olen Jones Jr., PhD, tells why it is such benefit for students to train in rural areas. "First, we want to expose our students to rural medicine. By placing our students in rotations at these rural areas across the state, we hope they will learn to appreciate the advantages of living in a small community and develop an affinity for rural medicine...Not only do our students receive outstanding medical training, but the various hospitals and clinics are serving their patient base more efficiently by supplementing their staffs with our student doctors."
<p>

<hr><br>
<H3>Faculty Advisors Wanted</H3>

The National Youth Leadership Forum (NYLF), a non-profit educational organization, is looking for energetic individuals to serve as faculty advisors for high school honor students for two, eleven-day programs on medicine in Boston, Chicago, Houston- Galveston, San Francisco, or Washington, D.C. Responsibilities include facilitating small group discussions, general supervising of assigned groups of high school honor students, accompanying all site visits and outings in the conference city, preparing student's for each day's activities, providing supervision and assistance in residence at the forum site; and guiding students through role playing simulation.
<P>

Aside from the obvious need for outstanding medical knowledge, advisors must also have experience working with high school students as well as attend a week-long paid training session prior to the forums. Faculty advisors will be working with students who have demonstrated outstanding academic achievement and a special interest in a career in medicine.
<P>

For osteopathic medical students interested in applying for a 1997 National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine Faculty Advisor Position (NYLF/MD), send a cover letter and resume to: 1997 NYLF/MD Staff, National Youth Leadership Forum, 1511 K St., NW Suite 843, Washington, D.C., 20005. For further information and application materials, please contact NYLF at the above address or via e-mail: medstaff@nylf.org. Deadline for applications is March 1.

<H3>Presidential Travels</H3>

One of my goals as AOA president is to travel throughout America visiting our affiliates and medical schools seeking their support and membership in the AOA. There are various medical societies offering memberships, but only the AOA has the ability to serve as the link amongst all the nation's 40,000 osteopathic physicians. Serving as a representative of the AOA, I have attended numerous functions, including the dedication of Midwestern University's Glendale (Ariz.) Campus; the American Osteopathic College of Anesthesiologists annual convention; the annual meeting of the American College of Osteopathic Surgeons; the American Osteopathic Academy of Orthopedics membership banquet; and the annual banquet of the American Osteopathic College of Radiology. Aside from these visits, I have also been in the offices of our AOA headquarters in Chicago on several occasions, meeting with all department directors about the latest administrative activities.

"Perhaps the osteopathic medical profession historically has been
more inclined to support underrepresented minority groups because 
the profession itself has struggled in the past against the
ignorance of those incognizant of the tenets of the osteopathic
medical profession.  In a sense, as DOs, we all come from a history
of struggle and a kind of oppression, and perhaps this is what makes
us stronger as doctors and stronger as people."

The American Osteopathic Association adopted a formal code of
ethics in 1904 at its 8th annual convention, held in St. Louis,
Missouri, July 11-15.  The code of ethics was developed to
establish guidelines for appropriate professional conduct.  The
code prohibited unethical advertising, and took a dim view of
price wars between competing osteopathic physicians, suggesting
that DOs within regional areas agree upon reasonable fees
among themselves.
<p>
The code of ethics also barred physicians from taking each
other's patients, recommending "... A physician ought not to
take care of or treat a patient who has recently been under
the care of another osteopathic physician, in the same illness,
except in the case of sudden emergency, or in consultation
with the physician previously in attendance ...."
<p>
The American Osteopathic Association had an estimated 850
members at the time.

As the AOA's 100th president, I have the unique pleasure of leading our organization as it celebrates the 100th anniversary of its founding on April 19. Not only surviving - but thriving - for 100 years is no small feat. And this will be no small celebration. Numerous plans are already in the works, including a commemorative AOA Centennial History magazine. This publication will be an outstanding retrospective that will offer a glimpse into the very first days of the AOA's existence. For osteopathic medical students, this publication will be especially meaningful as it shows the vital role that osteopathic medical students have played in the AOA since its very beginning. An excerpt from the September 1901 <I>Journal of the American Osteopathic Association,</I> which appears in the history magazine, reveals just how important osteopathic medical students were to the conception of the AOA.
<P>

<center><table width=75%><tr><td>
 "...in the autumn of 1896 a move was started among the students at Kirksville to effect an organization. A meeting of students and nearby osteopathists was held on Feb. 6, 1897. Discussion revealed a unanimity of sentiment, and the practical work of perfecting the organization was enthusiastically entered upon. A committee of 16 members, four students from each class, was appointed to formulate a plan of organization. On March 13th the report of this committee was submitted and the constitution of the American Association for the Advancement of Osteopathy was approved by sections, final action being deferred until a later meeting. In the meantime the proposed constitution was sent to all osteopathists and to the other schools, inviting suggestion and cooperation. The committee reported strong endorsement of the plan, and on April 19th a permanent organization was effected."
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>

Throughout 1997, the AOA will see to it that the work of these 16 students is honored with a celebration befitting of an organization that today stands at 24,500 members strong.
<p>

Aside from the AOA Centennial magazine, Centennial banners are currently in production that will be displayed along Michigan Avenue in Chicago, within view of the AOA offices. As the final touches are put on the banners, 3,000 AOA Centennial media kits will be distributed to media outlets, affiliates and key medical associations; and a Centennial news release will be sent to 2,000 top media outlets via newswire. For those "surfing" the Internet, Centennial updates will also appear on the AOA web site. In March, I will personally take part in working with the media through the production of an audio news release. In April, a second news release will be distributed via newswire and the AOA communications department will begin intensive contact with key members of the media. 
<p>

</td></tr></table>

Throughout the summer, the AOA will continue to work with the media and members of the AOA will continue to learn about the Centennial through its newsletters as well as <I>The DO</I> magazine. In July, the Centennial banners will adorn Michigan Avenue in time for the annual AOA House of Delegates meeting which will take place in downtown Chicago.
<p>

You can see that there are exciting times for our organization in the months ahead. As you take part in the celebration, please pause for a moment to reflect and think of those 16 students who gathered in Kirksville a century ago. At the time of the AOA's founding, osteopathic medicine was growing rapidly. There were battles with the existing medical profession, legal issues, and the communication amongst osteopathic physicians required the presence of a strong organization. Isn't it amazing what we have in common with 16 osteopathic medical students from a century ago! We all owe a tremendous debt to these students. To fully repay this debt, we must continue to grow; solidify our rightful place as an established form of medicine; make our voice heard in the legal battles; and communicate with our members across the country to see that osteopathic medicine has the organization it desperately needs to continue to survive - and thrive - into our next century.

<H3>West Virginia Study Reflects DOs Impact in Rural Areas</H3>

As I'm sure you are aware, one of the greatest services provided by osteopathic physician is our ability to provide medial care in the rural, under served areas of the country. Reinforcing this fact about osteopathic medicine is the 1996 annual report from the West Virginia Rural Health Education Partnerships (WVRHEP). According to the report, students from the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine (WVSOM) served more than 170 rotations totaling 852 weeks at the WVRHEP consortiums across the state. Also, WVSOM students served 313 rotations for a total of 1,434 weeks at other rural sites in West Virginia. These statistics were compiled from June 1, 1995 - May 31, 1996.
<p>

WVSOM president Olen Jones Jr., PhD, tells why it is such benefit for students to train in rural areas. "First, we want to expose our students to rural medicine. By placing our students in rotations at these rural areas across the state, we hope they will learn to appreciate the advantages of living in a small community and develop an affinity for rural medicine...Not only do our students receive outstanding medical training, but the various hospitals and clinics are serving their patient base more efficiently by supplementing their staffs with our student doctors."
<p>

<hr><br>
<H3>Faculty Advisors Wanted</H3>

The National Youth Leadership Forum (NYLF), a non-profit educational organization, is looking for energetic individuals to serve as faculty advisors for high school honor students for two, eleven-day programs on medicine in Boston, Chicago, Houston- Galveston, San Francisco, or Washington, D.C. Responsibilities include facilitating small group discussions, general supervising of assigned groups of high school honor students, accompanying all site visits and outings in the conference city, preparing student's for each day's activities, providing supervision and assistance in residence at the forum site; and guiding students through role playing simulation.
<P>

Aside from the obvious need for outstanding medical knowledge, advisors must also have experience working with high school students as well as attend a week-long paid training session prior to the forums. Faculty advisors will be working with students who have demonstrated outstanding academic achievement and a special interest in a career in medicine.
<P>

For osteopathic medical students interested in applying for a 1997 National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine Faculty Advisor Position (NYLF/MD), send a cover letter and resume to: 1997 NYLF/MD Staff, National Youth Leadership Forum, 1511 K St., NW Suite 843, Washington, D.C., 20005. For further information and application materials, please contact NYLF at the above address or via e-mail: medstaff@nylf.org. Deadline for applications is March 1.

<H3>Presidential Travels</H3>

One of my goals as AOA president is to travel throughout America visiting our affiliates and medical schools seeking their support and membership in the AOA. There are various medical societies offering memberships, but only the AOA has the ability to serve as the link amongst all the nation's 40,000 osteopathic physicians. Serving as a representative of the AOA, I have attended numerous functions, including the dedication of Midwestern University's Glendale (Ariz.) Campus; the American Osteopathic College of Anesthesiologists annual convention; the annual meeting of the American College of Osteopathic Surgeons; the American Osteopathic Academy of Orthopedics membership banquet; and the annual banquet of the American Osteopathic College of Radiology. Aside from these visits, I have also been in the offices of our AOA headquarters in Chicago on several occasions, meeting with all department directors about the latest administrative activities.

<p>
AOA members will receive <font size=+1>Individual Activity Reports</font> of
 their CME credits at appropriate intervals.  The report will be a
 computer print-out of CME activity as compiled from documents submitted to the Division of Continuing Medical
 Education by both sponsors and the physician.

<p>
All acceptable CME hours will be indicated, even though
 they may exceed the maximum allowable for a particular category.  Total hours applicable to each physician's CME requirement will be indicated in a statistical summary at the bottom of
 the report.

<p>
The main portion of the report will be a line-by-line listing
 of each CME activity or program recorded for the physician.
 Each line will indicate the date of the activity, the unique program number assigned to it for computer recording, the title of
 the program, the category under which credits were granted,
 and the number of hours granted.

<p>
Any physician who believes an error has been made in this
   report should contact the Division of CME and supply appropriate documentation so the record may be corrected.

<p>
A charge will be made for <font size=+1>Individual Activity Reports</font>
   requested by AOA non-members.

<p>
<I>NOTE:</I> Individual Activity Reports will be mailed to physicians.  It is the physician's right and responsibility to forward
   duplicate copies of this report to others, as necessary.

<h2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></h2>

<p>
This edition of the CME Guide includes certain changes in the requirements, guidelines and procedures of the American Osteopathic Association's program on continuing medical education effective as of January 1, 1995.

<p>
These changes reflect both experiences accumulated by the Council on CME in administering the program since it was initiated on June 1, 1973, as well as many specific recommendations made by those participating in the program.

<p>
While the objectives of the CME program remain the same, these changes are intended to simplify administrative procedures and make all requirements, guidelines and procedures more easily understood.

<p>
This document is designed to serve as a handy reference which should answer most, but probably not all, questions concerning the CME program.  It can serve its intended purpose, however, only if it is read thoroughly, its contents absorbed, and then referred to as specific questions arise.  The special summary found on the center pages should be particularly helpful in answering the most common questions.

<p>
The Council welcomes comments and suggestions from all individuals and organizations participating in the program.  These should be directed to the Division of CME, American Osteopathic Association, 142 E. Ontario Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611.

<b>

The basic objectives of continuing medical education are the growth of knowledge, the refinement of skills, and the deepening of understanding.

<p>
The ultimate goals of continuing medical education are continued excellence of patient care and improving the health and well-being of the individual patient and the public.  

<p>
The American Osteopathic Association's mandatory program of continuing medical education is designed to encourage and assist osteopathic physicians in achieving these objectives and goals.

<p>
This is implemented, in part, by granting credits to osteopathic physicians for their participation in approved CME activities sponsored by recognized organizations, institutions and agencies.

<p> 
Specifically excluded from credit, however, are educational programs leading to any formal advanced standing within the profession.  These include pre-doctoral courses in colleges of osteopathic medicine, internships, residencies, preceptorships and fellowships.

<p>
Approved educational activities may be formal or informal, full- or part-time.  These include, but are not limited to, scientific seminars, workshops, refresher and postgraduate courses, lectures, home study, and local, state, regional and national medical meetings.

<p>
The American Osteopathic Association grants CME credits to osteopathic physicians for their participation in educational activities meeting specific criteria.  These criteria, depending on the type of activity, are described on subsequent pages.

<p>
In all cases, credit is granted only after the educational activity has been completed and documented.  Sponsors must have AOA accreditation for conducting a formal osteopathic program.  They may submit programs in advance to the AOA Division of Continuing Medical Education for review.  If a program meets criteria, the sponsor will be notified that "initial" approval has been granted, or that the program may be "eligible" for CME credits.  Mention of such approval or eligibility may be included in announcements of the program and the printed program itself.

<p>
Osteopathic physicians wishing to know if a particular program is eligble for CME credit should first review the criteria under the appropriate category in the Guide.  If the program meets the criteria, they may assume it is eligible and that they will be granted CME credits by properly reporting and documenting their participation.  If in doubt, they should contact the Division of Continuing Medical Education at the AOA.

<p>
It is not mandatory, however, that a program be approved in advance to be eligible for CME credit since final determination of credits and categories are made only after a program has been completed.  

<P>
Physicians are encouraged to consult various AOA publications, including the <I>AOA COMING EVENTS</I>, published in THE DO to plan their CME activities in advance, compatible with their personal and professional interest and needs.

<p>
The Council on Continuing Medical Education is devoting increased attention to the educational quality and value of programs it approves for CME credit.

<p>
While "quality" and "value" admittedly are subjective, here are objective standards of evaluation which can help determine if an educational activity does in fact meet educational needs.  The Council gradually will integrate these standards into its evaluation procedures.

<p>
In particular, the Council expects all CME planning groups to include three guidelines to help insure that the program is a meaningful educational experience.

<p>
First, the program should provide a clear statement of its educational objectives.

<p>
Next, the program should selectively utilize the faculty, formal and educational modalities best suited to the topic.

<p>
Finally, the program should conclude with some form of evaluation to determine if the educational objectives have been accomplished.

<p>
With these guidelines the physician can determine if the program meets the physician specific educational needs and thus become more intelligently selective in his/her CME activities.

<p>
The AOA CME quality guidelines are:

<OL>
<LI>CME will be systematically organized and administered.

<LI>The program should focus on the needs of the participants.  The programs should be based on some type of needs assessment when possible:  that is, using a needs-identifying-process to form a priority list for educational programs in <I>advance</I> - based on deficiencies, problems, and needs.  (that is, every program is to be a planned program of learning, not just one of trial and error conceived by a program chairman.)

<p>
Some examples of these needs assessments are as follows:
<p>

<OL TYPE=A START=1>
<LI> Medical Audit (Identifying Needs)

<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
<LI>Develop criteria of excellence (such as FOR A P.R.O.)
<LI>Collect and summarize data
<LI>Analyze and interpret data.

</OL>

<LI>Pre-Test item analysis (Identified Needs)
<LI>Self-Assessment (Identified Needs and Felt Needs)
<LI>Questionnaire (Physician Felt Needs)

</OL>

<LI>Establish a faculty for CME with adequate credentials.

<LI>Every program should have stated and printed educational objectives.  The objectives should state what the physician should know or be able to do at the end of the program, for example:  correction of outdated knowledge, and new knowledge in specific areas; master new skills, change attitudes or habits, etc.

<LI>Primary evaluation responsibility lies with the CME sponsors.

<LI>CME programs should include a variety of course-class altenatives and encourage innovative program development.

<LI>Each program should have a statement as to the type of audience for whom the program is designed - for example:  general practitioners, surgeons, cardiologists, etc. - and the program should be <I>relevant</I> to the practice needs of this audience.

<LI>The sponsors should encourage active participation by the learner wherever possible.

<LI>Attendance records should be kept as means of assuring that those attending a program are given proper credit toward their CME requirement.

<LI>Sponsors shall conduct a post-course evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the program and whether the stated objectives were met.
Examples of evaluation methods are:

<OL TYPE=A START=1>

<LI>Pre and post testing.
<LI>Self-assessment.
<LI>Practice in hospital medical audits.
<LI>Post-course critique.

</OL>

<LI>The sponsors should assure that proper facilities and equipment are provided to enable the presenter to teach effectively.



</OL>

<b>
The American Osteopathic Association grants credit for Continuing Medical Education on a three year calendar period.  The prior "three-year" period of the CME program was January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1994.  Required CME credit hours were earned at any time within that calendar period.

<p>
No credit, however, was granted for activities pursued prior to January 1, 1992. No credits, likewise, can be carried beyond December 31, 1994.

<p>
Thus, as of January 1, 1995, all osteopathic physicians participating in the program begin an entirely new calendar and will be expected to meet all CME requirements for each new calendar period thereafter.

<font size=+5>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Requirements</font>

<img src="../rule2.gif"> <p><br>
</center>

<b>
<p>
<font size=+1>All AOA Members - </font> All AOA members engaged in active clinical practice are required to participate in the CME program and meet specified CME credit hour requirements to remain eligible for continued membership in the Association.  Certified or board eligible D.O.'s must meet additional requirements related to their basic certification.  

<p>
An "active" practitioner is defined as one who renders patient care, whether on a full-or-part-time basis.

<p>
Except as indicated in the exemptions, and reduction or waiver of requirements sections below, AOA members are required to obtain a minimum of 150 CME credit hours for each 3-year calendar period. 

<p>
A minimum of 60 credits of the total requirement must be obtained under Category 1-A or 1-B, described below.  However, the <I>full</I> CME requirement may be earned under Category 1, in which case a maximum of 90 credits may be applied to Category 1-B.

<p>
A maximum of 90 credit hours of the total requirement may be earned under Category 2, described below.

<p>
<font size=+1>Certified Physicians -</font> Physicians who are board certified or board eligible must earn a minimum of 50 credit hours or more as may be mandated by the board of their basic certification in each 3-year CME period.  These hours may be earned in Category 1 or Category 2.  Failure to maintain this requirement will result in loss of certification or board eligibility.

<p>
Physicians who are board certified or board eligible in more than one specialty will be monitored in the basic certification area of their most recently obtained certification unless they submit a formal request to be monitored in one of their other specialties.

<p>
Physicians will be monitored in one specialty only.
<p>

<center>
<img src="reqr.gif"><br>
</center>


<p>
<H2>Exemption</H2>

<p>
AOA members specifically exempted from the CME program requirements include the following:
<p>

<UL>
<LI>Regular members not engaged in active clinical practice.
<LI>Retired members.
<LI>Associated members.
<LI>Regular members outside the limits of the U.S. and Canada.
<LI>Student members.
<LI>Members actively engaged in formal postgraduate programs such as internships, residencies and other approved training programs which lead to formal advanced standing within the profession.
<LI>Members actively participating in other AOA recognized postgraduate programs will qualify for exemption for the period of such training.
<LI>Military members assigned postions other than their specialty.
</UL>

<p>
Any osteopathic physician may participate in the AOA program and have his/her credits entered on the CME computer record.  This record may be necessary to satisfy CME requirements of the physician divisional society, practice affiliate, state licensing boards, or the osteopathic hospital in which the physician practices.

<p>
<H2>Reduction or Waiver of Requirements</H2>

<p>
The Council on Continuing Medical Education will formally consider requests for reduction or waiver of CME requirements based on individual mitigating circumstances.  Such requests, submitted in writing, should contain complete information indicating why reduction or waiver is indicated. All information will be held strictly confidential.  Formal notification of the Council's decision will be forwarded to the applicant as soon as possible.

<p>
Requirements also are reduced for AOA members who experience a change in membership or practice status between the beginning and end of each 3-year calendar period.  Examples include completing postdoctoral training and entering clinical practice, temporarily leaving practice for health or other personal reasons, re-entering practice or becoming an AOA member for the first time.

<p>
In such instances the number of credit hours required is reduced on a pro-rated formula, and the change entered on the physician's CME activity report.

<p>
The Council on CME may consider the waiver of up to the maximum of 10 hours of Category 1 requirement per year for osteopathic physicians on active duty in the military or public health service within 48 continguous states.  The Council may consider the waiver of the Category 1 requirement for physicians on active duty in the military and public health services outside the 48 continguous states.  However, in each instance, the physician must meet or exceed the total requirement of 150 hours per 3-year period or justify a request for waiver of hours from the Council on Continuing Medical Education.

<p>
Further, this policy applies to physicians on active duty who participate in medical programs authorized for uniformed physicians.

<p>
The Council on CME may consider the waiver of up to the maximum of 10 hours of Category 1 requirement per year for osteopathic physicians residing in small states.  Small states refers to areas or states within the United States and its territories in which the population of practicing osteopathic physicians is less than 200, excluding members on active duty in the military or public health services.

<p>
No credit may be granted for meetings entirely devoted to a
   hospital's business or administrative affairs.

<p>
<H3>HOME STUDY</H3>

<p>
Home Study - The Council strongly believes that participation in formal CME programs is essential in fulfilling a physician's total educational needs.  The Council is also concerned
   that the content and educational quality of many unsolicited
   home study materials are not subject to impartial professional
   review and evaluation.

<p>
For those reasons, the Council has limited the number of
   credits which may be granted for home study, and has adopted
   strict guidelines in granting those credits.

<p>
Reading - CME credits may be granted for reading
   the Journal of the AOA, THE D.O., and other selected journals
   published by AOA affiliated and accredited osteopathic
   organizations.

<p>
One-half credit per issue is granted alone.  An additional one-half credit per issue is granted if the CME quiz found in the
   AOA Journal is completed and returned to the Division of
   Continuing Medical Education.

<p>
CME credit for all other reading is limited to recognized scientific journals listed in <I>Index Medicus</I>.  Copies of the <I>Index Medicus</I> can be found in the medical libraries.  One-half credit
   per issue is granted for reading these recognized journals.

<p>
CME credits may be granted for mediated physician education programs recognized by the AOA or those considered to be
   in conformance with guidelines set by the CME Council.  These
   educational experiences could include audio cassette programs,
   video cassette programs, or computer assisted instruction.

<p>
For audio and video taped programs, credit will be awarded
   at the rate of one credit per hour of program playing time if an
   accompanying CME quiz is completed and return to the AOA.
   For computer assisted instruction, credit will be awarded at the
   rate of one credit per hour of time spent in completion of the
   program, if sponsor generated documentation of the number of
   hours and the program's completion is received by the AOA.

<p>
Other Home Study Courses - Subject-oriented and refresher
   home study course and programs sponsored by recognized professional organizations may be eligible for CME credit, at the
   discretion of the Council.  The number of credit hours indicated
   by the sponsor will be considered in the Council's evaluation
   of the program.

<P>
<H3>SCIENTIFIC EXHIBITS</H3>

<p>
Examples of scientific exhibits are preparation and personal
   presentation of a scientific exhibit at a county, regional, state
   or national professional meeting.  Appropriate documentation
   must be submitted with the request for credit.  Ten credits will
   be granted for each new and different scientific exhibit.

<p>
<H3>OTHER APPROVED CME</H3>
 
<p>
Other approved CME include all other programs and modalities of continuing medical education as they may be requested, verified and documented by the Council on CME.

<p>
Included under this category are formal and informal educational activities such as educational development; faculty
   development, physician administrator training; quality assessment programs; observation at medical centers; medical economics; programs dealing with experimental and investigative
   areas of medical practice; and programs specifically approved

<font size=+5>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Requests for Initial Approval</font>

<img src="../rule2.gif"> <p><br>
</center>

<b>

<p>
Accredited sponsors may request initial approval for formal
 educational programs in advance from the Division of
 Continuing Medical Education.

<p>
Requests should be made as early as possible, and must
 include all the following information:

<OL TYPE=1  START=1>

<LI>The full name of the accredited sponsoring organization
     or institution, and all co-sponsors.
<LI>The program's title or subject.
<LI>The location and date(s) of the program.
<LI>The faculty presenting the program, identified by name,
     title, or affiliation, and professional degree.
<LI>A list of each speaker's topic and the time allotted. Closing
     times for all sessions should be indicated.
<LI>The total number of educational hours, not including coffee breaks, lunches, etc.

</OL>

<p>
Programs will be individually evaluated, and sponsors notified by mail if initial approval has been granted or if the program may be eligible for CME credit.  The category and
 number of CME credits approved will be indicated.  Mention of
 such approval or eligibility may be included in announcements
 and the printed program.

<p>
It is not mandatory, however, that the program be approved
 in advance to be eligible for CME credits.  Final credits, in all
 cases, are granted only after a program has been completed
 and attendance documented.

<p>
Quality guidelines for the approval of Category I-A credit
 were adopted at the July, 1979 meeting of the AOA Board of
 Trustees.  These guidelines provide a new method for identifying sponsors of Category I-A credit. (See page ).

<p>
<font size=+1>AOA-CME Sponsor - </font> <I>Definition:</I> An AOA-CME sponsor
 of Category I-A programs is defined as an accredited osteopathic institution, organization, or affiliate that presents programs that qualify for AOA CME credit.

<p>
If two or more sponsors act in association, the responsibility
 for complying with the standards for quality is held jointly.  If
 an accredited sponsor acts in association with others in the
 development, distribution and/or presentation of CME activities, it is mandatory that the identity of the AOA accredited
 sponsor or sponsors be identified in the title, advertising and
 promotional materials and the responsibility for adherence to
 the standards of quality must rest with the AOA accredited
 sponsor.  The sponsor shall insure that sound educational goal
 planning takes place in all programs.


<p>
<font size=+1>Accreditation process for formal osteopathic sponsors:</font>

<p>
Prospective "formal" CME sponsors will seek recognition
    by following an AOA accreditation process.  If an applying
    sponsor gains AOA accreditation, then that sponsor may conduct programs either in Category I -A or I -B which follow
    basic AOA guidelines.

<p>
<I>NOTE:</I> Category 1-A programs may also be sponsored by
    accredited osteopathic institutions, organizations, and affiliates
    providing evidence that AOA standards are being met.  These
    accredited sponsors may seek prior approval of such programs.

<p>
An osteopathic institution, organization, or affiliate seeking
    accreditation as a "formal sponsor" shall be considered by the
    AOA Council on Continuing Medical Education only after certain minimum criteria are met.

<p>
These criteria may be met when the items listed below are
    received in the AOA Department of Education.

</OL  TYPE=1  START=1>

<LI>A completed application form.
<LI>Documentary evidence that the AOA quality standards
         for CME are being applied.
<LI>Each sponsoring group must provide assurance that at
         least 50% of each program or that sponsor's listing is
         planned and presented by osteopathic physicians or staff
         members of osteopathic institutions.
<LI>The sponsor will inform the AOA of program developments in a timely and systematic manner.

</OL>

<p>
The AOA will publish as part of the AOA Coming Events,
    with a special designation, the programs of accredited sponsors.  Each sponsor must reapply to retain the right to be
    accredited and to have special designations on the program
    published in the <font size=+1><I>AOA Coming Events</I></font>. The accreditation
    review will be conducted every five years, but the AOA
    Council on Continuing Medical Education retains the right to
    terminate accreditation for cause.  Due process is provided
    through the Bureau of Professional Education appeal mechanism and procedures.  The AOA will notify each applicant of
    the disposition of the accreditation request in a prompt and
    timely manner.

<b>

<p>
Reporting of CME activities may be submitted to the Divison of Continuing Medical Education by either sponsor or individual physicians.

<p>
It is <I>mandatory</I>, however, that <I>each</I> report of CME activities be submitted on the appropriate form.  Only in this way can appropriate credits under the appropriate category be entered on the individual physician's CME computer record.  Sponsors and physicians should not indicate more than one program or
  type of activity on a single form.  Copies of appropriate forms
  may be obtained from the Division of Continuing Medical
  Education.  These forms may be copied or reproduced as
  desired.

<p>
Sponsors should report physician participation in CME
  activities using either the "Roster of Attendance" or " Hospital
  Peer Review Activity" form.

<p>
The Roster of Attendance form is used to document attendance at formal educational programs sponsored by accredited
  organizations and institutions.  This form is provided to the
  sponsor by the Division of CME, usually with the notification
  of "initial" approval.

<p>
Each physician attending the program should be listed on the
  form by entering the appropriate AOA number, name, college
  and year of graduation.  The AOA number can be found on the
  physician's AOA membership card.  The completed form,
  together with a copy of the printed program, should be forwarded to the Division of CME by the sponsor, as soon as possible
  following the meeting.

<p>
<I>NOTE:</I> If this procedure is followed, physicians need not
  and should not submit individual certification of attendance.  It
  is the sponsor's responsibility, however, to inform physicians
  attending a program that their names are being submitted on
  the Roster of Attendance form.
   
<p>
The Hospital Peer Review Activity form is used to document participation by staff physicians in hospital CME activities and programs as described under Category I -B.
   
<p>
The form is designed to serve as a cumulative record of
  each staff physician's Category I-B CME activities.  No other
  activities or programs should be included on this form.

<p>
Copies of the form are provided to Director of Medical
  Education of accredited osteopathic hospitals by the Division
  of CME.  Completed forms for all staff physicians should be
  returned to the Division at one time, preferably quarterly.

<p>
<I>NOTE:</I> If these procedures are followed, staff physicians
  need not and should not submit individual certifications of
  Category I-B activities.

<p>
Attendance at special programs, seminars and meetings
  sponsored by the hospital should be reported on the "Roster of
  Attendance" form described above.

<p>
Physicians practicing in joint-staff hospitals should request
  copies of the Hospital Peer Review Activity form from the
  Division of Continuing Medical Education.

<p>
The Home Study form is intended to document individual
  reading of recognized scientific journals, listening to approved
  audio-tapes, and other approved home study courses and programs under the criteria described for Category 2-B.

<p>
Only one type of home study, such as reading, should be
  indicated on a Single form, though multiple issues of scientific
  journals may be listed.

<p>
This form should not be used, however, when CME quiz
   cards for the AOA Journal, and AOA Audio-Educational tape
   programs are submitted separately.

<p>
The Individual Certification form is intended for use by individual physicians to document all other CME activities not
   reported on other forms.

<p>
Copies of the Individual Certification form may be obtained
   from the Division of CME.

<p>
Examples of CME activities to be reported on this form
   include:

<UL>
<LI>Development and publication of scientific papers and
        electronically communicated programs - <font size=+1>Category 1-B.</font>
<LI>Medical teaching - <font size=+1>Category 1-B.</font>
<LI>Other osteopathic CME programs and activities approved
        by the Council on Continuing Medical Education - <font size=+1>Category 1-B.</font>
<LI>Attendance at formal educational programs sponsored by
        accredited institutions, organizations and agencies at which
        the "Roster of Attendance" form is not submitted by the
        sponsor - <font size=+1>Category 2-A</font>.  These include most non-osteopathic programs.
<LI>Scientific exhibits - <font size=+1>Category 2-B</font>.
<LI>All other programs and modalities of CME as they may
        be requested, verified and documented by the Council on
        Continuing Medical Education - <font size=+1>Category 2-B</font>.

</UL>

<p>
Only one CME activity or program may be reported on each
   Individual Certification form.  It is mandatory that documentation, appropriate to the program or activity, be enclosed with
   each form.  Forms listing more than one CME activity, or forms
   received without sufficient documentation, will be returned.

<b>

<p>
The Council on Continuing Medical Education reserves the
   right to evaluate all programs and activities on an individual
   basis, and to deny CME credits at its discretion to those which
   do not fulfill criteria described in this <font size=+1>Guide</font>.

<p>
For most CME programs, credit is granted on the formula of
   one credit for each hour of educational activity.  That formula
   may be modified at the Council's discretion, depending on
   individual circumstances.  In no case, however, will CME credit be granted for coffee breaks, social functions, or time allotted to business or administrative matters.

<p>
The number of CME credits indicated for a program by other
   organizations will be considered by the Council in its total evaluation.  However, in all cases, the Council reserves the right to
   make final determination of the number and category of credits
   granted.

<p>
Reports of CME activities which meet criteria will be
  accepted and appropriate credits entered on the physician's
  record.  All credits will be reported on the Individual Activity
  Report, described below.  Sponsors and physicians will be notified if CME credits are granted.  For these reasons, it is essential that both sponsors and physicians keep duplicate copies of
  all forms submitted for CME credits.

<p>
If the Council has any reason to question a CME program or
  activity, the sponsor or physician will be requested to clarify
  specific matters before final approval is granted and credits are
  recorded.  Sponsors and physicians will be notified by mail in
  all cases where CME credits are reduced or denied, with the
  reasons for such action indicated.

<p>
<font size=+3>UNIFORM GUIDELINES FOR ACCREDITING AGENCIES OF CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION</font>

<p>
<font size=+2>PREAMBLE</font> <br>

In 1990, an inter-organizational task force, the Task Force
  on CME and Industry Collaboration, was formed to foster better informed collaboration between commercial supporters and
  all major accredited sponsors of continuing medical education.
  Included in the membership of the Task Force on CME and
  Industry Collaboration are senior staff members of major pharmaceutical and device manufacturers, and leaders of continuing medical education in the United States.  The Task Force has
  blended the diverse knowledge, interests, and talents of its
  members to produce these Guidelines which address all
  aspects of continuing medical education, not just relationships
  with commercial supporters.

<P>
These Guidelines will provide a credible standard to which
  the health professions may compare their criteria for accrediting continuing medical education.  The AOA believes that
  much mutual benefit will flow from the unity among the professions through application of these policies and procedures.

<P>
The AOA has adopted, with minor changes, the Uniform
  Guidelines for Accrediting Agencies of Continuing Medical
  Education.  These Uniform Guidelines have been adopted as a
  part of the Continuing Medical Education Guide of the
  American Osteopathic Association.

<P>
Although members of the Task Force are associated with
  most of the major players in the CME and the health-related
  commercial interests in the U.S., the Task Force has no official
  status in government, industry, or education.

<P>
The AOA CCME and its staff members are available to help
  with interpretation of the task force actions and implementation of the AOA guidelines.

<OL TYPE=I  START=1>

<LI> <font size=+1>Introduction</font> <br>

The purpose of continuing medical education (CME) is to
  enhance the physician's ability to care for patients.  It is the
  responsibility of the accredited sponsor of a CME activity to
  assure that the educational activity is designed primarily for
  that purpose.
<p>
Accredited sponsors often receive financial and other support from commercial organizations.  Such support can contribute significantly to the quality of CME activities.  

<p>
The purpose of the "Uniform Guidelines" is to describe
   appropriate behaviors expected of accredited sponsors in planning, designing, implementing, and evaluating CME activities.
   Further, the "Uniform Guidelines" apply to those continuing
   medical education activities for which an accredited sponsor
   receives commercial support.

<LI> <font size=+1>Management of CME Activities</font>

<OL  TYPE=A  START=1>

<LI> <font size=+1>Mission Statement</font> <br>

An accredited sponsor shall define the role, scope and
            intended audience of its educational functions by having a written statement of its CME mission formally
            approved by its governing body.

<LI> <font size=+1>Management Support</font> <br>

An accredited sponsor shall provide evidence that
            management procedures and other necessary
            resources are available and effectively used to fulfill
            its CME mission.

<LI> <font size=+1>Joint Educational Activities</font> <br>

An accredited sponsor that provides educational activities jointly with a non-accredited entity shall assure
            that such activities are conducted entirely according
            to these "Uniform Guidelines".

<LI> <font size=+1>Enduring Materials</font> <br>

An accredited sponsor that offers instructional materials, that in themselves constitute a planned activity of
            CME, shall develop and administer those materials
            entirely according to these "Uniform Guidelines".

<LI> <font size=+1>Funding Arrangements</font> <br>

The ultimate decision regarding funding arrangements
            for CME activities must be the responsibility of the
            accredited sponsor.  Funds from a commercial source
            should be in the form of an educational grant for the
            support of programming made payable to the accredited sponsor.  The terms of the grant must be set forth
            in a written agreement.  There shall be no other funds
            paid to faculty, CME program directors, or others
            involved with the supported program except as provided in the written agreement.  All support associated
            with an educational activity must be made under the
            direction of, and with the full knowledge and
            approval of, the accredited sponsor.
<p>
Payment of reasonable honoraria and reimbursement
            of out-of-pocket expenses for faculty is customary and
            proper.  Commercial support must be acknowledged in
            printed announcements and brochures; however, reference must not be made to specific commercial products.  Following the CME activity, upon request, the
            accredited sponsor must be prepared to report to each
            commercial supporter, information concerning the
            expenditure of funds each has provided.

<LI> <font size=+1>Marketing CME Activities</font> <br>

A CME sponsor may authorize a commercial supporter to disseminate to the medical community information about a CME activity.  However, the content of
            such information must always be explicitly approved
            by, but not necessarily prepared by, the accredited
            sponsor, and must always identify the educational
            activity as produced by the accredited sponsor.

<LI> <font size=+1>Expenses for Attendees</font> <br>

In connection with an educational activity, it is not
            permissible to use funds originating from a commercial source to pay travel, lodging, registration fees,
            honoraria, or personal expenses for non-faculty attendees.  Subsidies for hospitality should not be provided
            outside of modest meals or social events that are held
            as a part of the educational activity.

<p>
Scholarship or other special funding to permit medical students, interns, or residents and fellows to
            attend selected educational conferences may be provided, as long as the selection of students, intems or
            residents and fellows who will receive the funds is
            made either by the academic or training institution, or
            by the accredited sponsor, with the full concurrence
            of the academic or training institution.

<LI> <font size=+1>Educational Standards and Practices</font>
    
<OL TYPE=A  START=1>

<LI> <font size=+1>Needs Assessment</font> <br>

An accredited sponsor shall systematically identify
            the CME needs of prospective participants and use
            that information in planning CME activities.

<LI> <font size=+1>Objectives</font> <br>

An accredited sponsor shall, for each CME event,
            develop objectives based on identified educational
            needs.

<LI>  <font size=+1>Educational Design</font> <br>

<OL TYPE=1  START=1> 

<LI> <font size=+1>Objectives Influence Design</font> An accredited sponsor shall use the objectives developed for an educational activity to select the content, and design
               the educational methods, for that activity.

<LI>  <font size=+1>Basic design requirements for CME activities</font>
               In designing educational activities, the accredited
               sponsor must assure that the activities have the
               following characteristics:

<p>
They must be free of bias for or against any commercial product;

<p>
They must be designed and produced so that content and educational methods are ultimately determined by the accredited sponsor;

<p>
If the activities are concerned with commercial products, the program must present objective information about such products based on scientific methods generally accepted in the medical community.

<LI> <font size=+1>Independence of Accredited Sponsors</font> The
             design and production of educational activities
             shall be the ultimate responsibility of the accredited sponsor.  Commercial supporters of such activities shall not control the planning, content or
             execution of the activity.  To assure compliance
             with the "Uniform Guidelines" the following
             requirements must be adhered to:


<OL TYPE=a  START=1>

<LI> <font size=+1>Help with the preparation of educational 
                materials</font> <br>

The content of slides and reference materials
                must remain the ultimate responsibility of the
                faculty of accredited sponsor.  This responsibility may be shared with the faculty of the accredited sponsor.  The accredited sponsor may ask a
                commercial supporter to help with the preparation of conference related educational materials,
                but these shall not specifically promote the proprietary interests of the commercial supporter.


<LI>  <font size=+1>Assistance with Educational Planning</font> <br>

An accredited sponsor must maintain responsibility for and control over the selection of content, schedule, faculty, attendees, and
                educational methods and materials in all of its
                CME activities.

<p>
An accredited sponsor may obtain information
                that will assist in planning and producing an
                educational activity from any outside source
                whether commercial or not.  However, acceptance by an accredited sponsor of advice or services concerning speakers, invitees or other
                educational matters, including content, shall not
                be among the conditions for the provision of
                support by a commercial organization.

<LI>  <font size=+1>Distribution of advertising</font> <br>

No commercial promotional materials shall be
                displayed or distributed in the same room
                immediately before, during, or immediately
                after an accredited educational activity.
                Representatives of commercial supporters may
                attend an educational activity for which they
                have provided support, but may not engage in
                sales activities while in the room where the educational activity takes place.

<LI>  <font size=+1>Exhibits</font> <br>

When commercial exhibits are part of an overall program, arrangements for these must not
                 influence educational planning or interfere with
                 the presentation of CME activities.  Exhibit
                 placement must not be a condition of support
                 for a CME activity.
<LI>  <font size=+1>Proprietary Names of Products</font> <br>

While the use of proprietary names of products
                 is permissible during educational activities,
                 generic names should be used by the faculty
                 whenever possible.  Moreover, it is the responsibility of the accredited sponsor to assure that
                 presentations give a balanced view of diagnostic, therapeutic, or appliance options.  If proprietary names are used, those of several
                 companies that make relevant products must be
                 used rather than only those of a single company.

<LI> <font size=+1>Other Guidelines for Relationships between Accredited
      Sponsors and Commercial Supporters of CME.</font>

<OL  TYPE=A  START=1>

<LI>  <font size=+1>Communicating Results of Scientific Research</font> <br>

Objective, rigorous, scientific research conducted by
           commercial companies is an essential part of the
           process of developing new pharmaceutical or other
           medical products or devices.  It is highly desirable that
           direct reports of such research be communicated to
           the medical community.  An offer by a commercial
           supporter to provide a presentation reporting the
           results of scientific research shall be accompanied by
           a detailed outline of the presentation which shall be
           used by the accredited sponsor to confirm the scientific objectivity of the presentation.  Such information
           must conform to the generally accepted standards of
           experimental design, data collection and analysis.

<LI>  <font size=+1>Disclosure</font> <br>

An accredited sponsor shall have a policy requiring
           disclosure of the existence of any significant financial
           interest or other relationship a CME faculty member
           or the sponsor has with the manufacturer(s) of any
           commercial product(s) discussed in an educational
           presentation.  All approved CME activities shall conform to this policy.
           
<p>
Such faculty or accredited sponsor relationship with
           commercial supporters shall be disclosed to participants prior to educational activities in brief statements
           in conference materials such as brochures, syllabi,
           exhibits, poster sessions and post meeting publications.

<p>
In the case of a regularly scheduled event, such as
           grand rounds, disclosure shall be made by the moderator of the activity after consultation with the faculty
              member or a representative of the accredited sponsor.
              Written documentation that disclosure information
              was given to participants shall be entered in the file
              for that activity.

<LI>  <font size=+1>Off-label uses of products</font> <br>

When an off-label use of a product, or an investigational use not yet approved for any purpose, is discussed during an educational activity, the accredited
              sponsor shall require the speaker to disclose that the
              product is not labeled for the use under discussion, or
              that the product is still investigational.  Discussions of
              such uses shall focus on those uses that have been
              subject of objective investigation.

<LI>  <font size=+1>Activities that are repeated many times</font> <br>

An accredited sponsor that offers educational activities that repeat essentially the same information each
              time they are given, must demonstrate that every iteration of that activity meets all of the provisions found
              in these "Uniform Guidelines".

<LI>  <font size=+1>The use of an accredited sponsor of educational
              activities or materials prepared by organizations
              other than the accredited sponsor</font> <br>

When an accredited sponsor offers an educational
              activity based on concepts or materials prepared by an
              outside organization, that activity must adhere to
              these "Uniform Guidelines" in all respects, especially
              in regards to the provisions concerning the independence of the accredited sponsor in planning, designing, delivering, and evaluating all of its educational
              activities offered for credit.

<H3 ALIGN=Center>AOA succeeds in passing Medicaid legislation recognizing AOA board certification</H3><BR>
<p>
The AOA claimed a major victory on September 27, when the US Congress unanimously passed the Medicaid Certification Act of 1996 (H.R. 1791). H.R. 1791 corrects a provision in Medicaid law (OBRA '90) which ultimately established criteria physicians would have to meet to treat Medicaid recipients who are pregnant women and children. One of the requirements in the statute was that physicians must hold allopathic (MD) board certification. The approval of H.R. 1791 includes osteopathic board certification, which is a vital element of the bill because it ensures that DOs certified by the AOA can continue to treat this particular group of Medicaid patients.<p>

Prior to President Clinton's signing of the bill, the AOA had spent the past six years persuading Congress to correct the error on OBRA '90. The AOA began its final push to pass the bill on Sept. 13, when  the AOA urged members of the House Commerce Committee to review the bill along with other Medicaid technical corrections bills that were under discussion by the committee. The bill reached the House floor on Sept. 19 and the Senate on Sept. 24. The bill was officially signed into law by President Clinton on October 9. <p>

Lieutenant General Ronald R. Blanck, U.S. Army, DO, a board certified osteopathic physician, was sworn in as the 39th surgeon general of the Army and was promoted to the three-star rank of lieutenant general on October 1.<p>

A 1967 graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Dr. Blanck is currently the commander of Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the North Atlantic Regional Medical Command. As the Army's surgeon general, he will also command the U.S. Army Medical Command at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The medical command operates eight medical centers, nearly 30 community hospitals, as well as research and teaching institutions around the world.<p>

Entering the Army in 1968, Dr. Blanck was assigned as a general medical officer in Vietnam. Following an assignment as a general medical officer at Fort Myer, Dr. Blanck completed a residency in internal medicine at Walter Reed in 1973. He went on to serve as assistant chief of the general medicine service and as the assistant chief in the department of medicine at Walter Reed. Later assignments included serving as assistant dean of student affairs at Uniformed Services University School of Medicine; chief of the department of medicine at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston; and chief of the medical corps career activities office in the office of the surgeon general. Dr. Blanck also served as commander of the Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center in Frankfurt, Germany and as the director of professional services and chief of medical corps affairs in the office of the surgeon general. <p>

<H3 ALIGN=Center>AOA, ACOOG unveil "A Woman's Guide to Managed Care"</H3>

In an effort to educate women about managed care and help them make informed healthcare decisions for themselves and their families, the AOA has teamed up with the American College of Osteopathic Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOOG) to produce a comprehensive presentation, "A Woman's Guide To Managed Care."<p>

The presentation kit and brochure will provide a step-by-step guide on selecting a managed care plan, from teaching women how to evaluate a managed care organization (MCO), to suggesting key questions they should ask about covered services and providers.<p>

<img src="woman.gif" ALIGN=right>

A ready-to-use presentation kit will be available from the AOA to DOs who wish to address local women's groups. The $45 kit will include a script, 35 mm slides, and brochures. Physicians using the materials will be enhancing their practice visibility and promoting the osteopathic medical profession as well as delivering important information.<p>

A Woman's Guide to Managed Care" brochures will join the AOA's literature series and will be available through the AOA Order Department for $25/100. The brochures will also discuss the benefits of osteopathic medical care.<p>

The development of the presentation kit and brochure come at an ideal time, according to James E. Zini, DO, chairman of the AOA Committee on Public Relations. "Today, more people than ever before receive medical coverage through managed care plans. The understanding of how plans operate, what benefits and services they provide, and how well they respond to their enrollees is vital. The presentation program is of special significance to women, who are often the primary healthcare decision-makers for their families," Dr. Zini said.<p>

"A Woman's Guide to Managed Care" was developed by members of the ACOOG Ad Hoc Committee on Health Promotion for Women in conjunction with the AOA Committee on Public Relations. <p>

<H3 ALIGN=Center>DOs staff national health hotline during convention Dial-A-DO</H3>
<H4 ALIGN=Center>Publicity reaches 11 million Americans</H4>

Hypertension and pregnancy. Cancer and the common cold. Whatever the question, 68 DOs were on hand with answers during the 2nd annual Dial-A-DO, held at the AOA's 101st Annual Convention and Scientific Seminar in Las Vegas last October.<p>

<table align=left width=33%><tr><td>

AOA trustee, Captain Michael Murphy, DO, MC, answered health-related questions from callers across the country during the second annual Dial-A-DO. More than 1,500 called in to Dial-A-DO over the course of the two-day program.
</b></font></td></tr></table>

The two-day hotline offered people across the nation an opportunity to speak directly to a physician for information on their health or osteopathic medicine. While DOs did not diagnose by phone, they answered health questions and even directed several callers to emergency rooms for immediate treatment.<p>

More than 1,500 people throughout America took advantage of the health hotline, which accepted calls for 12 hours each day. The largest volume of calls (542) came from Illinois, with California (288) dialing in at number two.<p>

DO volunteers completed data sheets for every caller, recording the question(s) asked; age/gender of callers; and their location. Callers were also asked where they heard about the program. The data will help the AOA department of communications develop a bigger and better program for 1997, and will also help to identify typical health concerns.<p>

What did callers want to know? Nearly 10 percent of all calls pertained to musculoskeletal problems. Others asked questions about reproduction/sexual health; many were concerned about wellness, nutrition and exercise, and others inquired about the common cold. Many callers wanted to learn more about osteopathic medicine and requested a DO in their area.<p>

Evaluation of the caller sheets revealed some interesting data as well: The average age of callers was 49. The youngest caller was 11 while the oldest caller was 87. In addition, more women than men called the hotline.<p>

Dial-A-DO was promoted on radio, television and in newspapers across the country. In addition, the AOA distributed more than 15,000 promotional flyers, and mailed toy cellular phones bearing a message to 250 top media outlets.<p>

While final usage reports have not yet been received, the program thus far has generated nearly 11 million audience impressions.<p>

One promotional vehicle was a video news release (VNR) package featuring AOA president John P. Sevastos, DO and Dial-A-DO volunteer, M. Jay Porcelli, DO, a California-based family physician. The piece included information about Dial-A-DO and osteopathic physicians; it appeared on newscasts in Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, Phoenix, and Greensboro, N.C.<p>

News releases were distributed to over 5,000 papers nation-wide, with placements in publications including <I>The Daily Oklahoman</I> (Oklahoma City, Okla.); <I>Journal</I> (Albuquerque, NM); <I>Daily Bulletin</I> (Ontario, Calif.); <I>Democrat</I> (Tallahassee, Fla.) <I>Labor Paper</I> (Kenosha, Wis.) and <I>Parent Guide</I> magazine. <p>

DOs staffed the phone lines in two hour shifts, working in a specially constructed lucite walled room on the convention's exhibit floor. In all, 84 shifts were filled, with many DOs volunteering additional hours. Participants received a "Dial-A-DO" t-shirt and an AOA coffee mug in recognition for their support of the program. Their volunteer efforts were also promoted via news releases sent to their hometown papers and affiliate organizations.<p>

Dial-A-DO is sponsored by SmithKline Beecham as part of the "Osteopathic Medicine's Caring Cooperative" initiative. <p>

For two days of the AOA's 101st Annual Convention and Scientific Seminar in Las Vegas, 56 DOs participated in the AOA's radio interviews. The efforts of the osteopathic physicians that participated in the program resulted in the 1996 AOA radio interviews reaching a total audience of nearly 93 million.<p>

Speakers and leaders were interviewed by a professional broadcaster on subjects ranging from back pain to drug abuse among teenagers. Osteopathic physicians were able to discuss their topic with the broadcaster prior to the interview to ensure that they would be able to focus on the key points of the topic during the actual interview.  The entire process took each physician approximately ten minutes. Once the interviews were completed, they were sent to individual and network stations of each participating physician. Interviews aired on a total of 2,436 stations, including nine regional networks and four national networks. <p>

Nickey, DO, FACOI, representing the AOA on the NHBPEP coordinating committee&#151;a body of 45 professional, voluntary, and Federal health agencies said, "the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reports that, of those age 70 or older, only 19 percent of white women and 16 percent of white men are controlling their blood pressure. In the same age group, African Americans do somewhat better (23 percent of women and 25 percent of men), but only 7 percent of Mexican American women and 12 percent of Mexican American men are controlling their blood pressure to below 140/90 mm Hg." <p>

<H3><I>Happy 100th Birthday, AOA!</I><BR>
American Osteopathic Association Celebrates Century of Service<br>
to Osteopathic Medical Profession</H3>
</center>
<br><p>

Chicago -- Some say that a profession is only as good as its national association. In the case of osteopathic medicine, this may very well be true.  For 100 years, the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) has worked to establish and protect practice rights for its members, osteopathic physicians (DOs) across the nation; it has struggled to establish equal status for DOs in a largely allopathic (M.D.) healthcare market; as the official accrediting body for osteopathic medical schools and healthcare facilities, it has ensured that rigid standards of training and operation are maintained; it has represented  DOs who are discriminated against by hospitals and third-party payers; and it continues to champion osteopathic causes at both state and federal governmental levels.
<p>
The vital role of the AOA in osteopathic medicine's evolution is widely recognized by osteopathic leaders. "Without the AOA, there would be no osteopathic medical profession.  We would be extinct," stated AOA President, John P. Sevastos, DO
<p>
Former AOA president William G. Anderson, DO, added, "Thanks to the AOA, the osteopathic medical profession has literally gone from a log cabin to the most prestigious halls in public and private life.  We've [become] a major player in healthcare."
<P>
Dr. Anderson made history in 1994, both for the AOA and for healthcare associations, when he became the first African American president of a general medical association.
<P>
The AOA was founded by a small group of DOs and osteopathic medical students in Kirksville, Missouri, in April, 1897. Until 1901, it was called the American Association for the Advancement of Osteopathy.  The AOA was created in response to issues of legal status, heightened public interest in osteopathic physicians, and growing hostility from established medicine.  
<P>
In order to prevent fragmentation of the profession and ensure consistent standards of education, the AOA was deemed the sole body for establishing standards for osteopathic medical colleges.  Today, the AOA is federally recognized as the sole accrediting agent for the nation's 17 osteopathic medical schools.
<P>
 "There is no question that a primary role of the AOA has been to set the standards for osteopathic medical schools," explained Philip Pomerantz, Ph.D., founding president of the Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA, and the AOA's former Director of Education.
<P>
Today, the AOA also accredits healthcare facilities nationwide, and is in the process of expanding its accreditation program in response to an identified market desire for alternative accrediting agencies.
<p>
Research is another cornerstone of the AOA.  The A.T. Still Research Institute, named for osteopathic medicine's founder, Andrew Taylor Still, was created by AOA leaders in 1909 and was later named the Bureau of Research.  Today, the Bureau has grown considerably thanks to member support, sponsoring several research programs aimed at quantifying the efficacy of osteopathic manipulative treatment, or OMT.
<P>
In light of the nation's growing interest in non-invasive treatment modalities, and governmental studies citing the effectiveness of manual medicine for some low back pain, OMT research could not come at a better time.
<P>
In the last century, AOA publicity efforts have greatly enhanced recognition and public perception of DOs nationwide.  The AOA's recent Care-A-Van project made national headlines and reached nearly 50 million people.  The Care-A-Vans were semi-trailers equipped to provide a spectrum of testing, from blood pressure, cholesterol, and pulmonary function to vision and structural exams.  Staffed by local DOs, they visited small towns and underserved regions across the nation. The AOA's two-year program reflected the osteopathic commitment to both primary care and medical care in underserved regions of the nation.
<p>
Other AOA efforts are protecting DOs from discrimination and positioning them to legislators.   The AOA works on behalf of DOs who are denied hospital privileges, or access to healthcare plans.  And it assists DOs who are not fairly reimbursed by third party payors for OMT and other uniquely osteopathic services.
<P>
"We have to continually remind federal and state legislators of the concerns that are important to DOs," explained Robert J. George, DO, a member of the AOA Council on Federal Health Programs.
<P>
Recent AOA efforts resulted in the appointment of a DO to the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC) in 1995, and the appointment of another DO to the Federal Practicing Physicians Advisory Council last year.
<P>
The AOA also played a key role in the nomination of Major General Ronald Blanck, DO, the first osteopathic physician to be named Surgeon General of the United States Army.
<P>
Recently, a major battle was fought--and won--by the AOA with the passage of a federal bill in Congress that guarantees practice rights for DOs treating women and children under Medicaid.
<p>
In addition to informing legislators and comsumers about DOs, the AOA keeps its members and other allied health groups apprised of professional activities through two publications, <I>The DO</I>, and<I> The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association</I>.  Both are free to all DOs and students who request them.  AOA members also receive newsletters pertaining to legislative, managed care, and student issues and AOA programs.
<P>
Thanks to the unyeilding efforts of the AOA, osteopathic medicine is now one of the nation's fastest growing health professions.  Today, there are nearly 40,000 DOs across the US, practicing in all areas of medicine, from pediatrics to neurosurgery. Though DOs represent just 6 percent of all complete physicians (DO and MD), they represent 18 percent of all family physicians.  Most DOs remain in primary care, in keeping with their holistic approach.  Their impressive and continued growth in the last century is the direct result of the AOA's commitment to the osteopathic medical profession.
<P>
With its commitment to protecting and promoting osteopathic physicians, plus an array of services for individual DOs, it's no wonder that more than 60 percent of the nation's DOs are AOA members.
<P>
As part of its centennial celebration, the AOA has created a history magazine for its members and affiliates, tracing the evolution of the association, and offering interesting facts about both the AOA and osteopathic medicine.
<P>
Osteopathic medicine was developed by Andrew Taylor Still, a physician who was dissatisfied with 19th century medicine.  His philosophy was based upon the idea that the body's systems are interconnected, and that dysfunction in one area affects the rest of the body.  Dr. Still was one of the first of his time to study the attributes of good health to better understand the disease process.  He emphasized wellness, including eating properly and keeping fit. And he believed that palpation and human touch were vital and less intrusive elements of healing, a spectrum of care known as osteopathic manipulative treatment, or OMT.
<P>

Fitness should be a lifelong goal because it leads to good
physical and mental health.  Staying healthy takes a mix
of exercise, healthy eating and a positive attitude.  Working
with your doctor, you can learn to live a healthier lifestyle 
and protect yourself from the risk of some diseases and 
medical conditions.  Here are a few tips for keeping yourself
and your family fit.</b></td>

<font size=+2>exercise</font><br>

<center><table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
Exercise can help you to control your weight, have more energy, sleep better and reduce stress.  It may even help you to live longer.<p>

By watching your weight, you can reduce your risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, heart attack, diabetes and some forms of cancer.  Without those 
extra pounds, there is less stress on your bones.  So, you'll
also be less likely to injure joints such as your knees and hips.<p>

Exercise is the key to fitness for people of all ages.  Did you know?

<UL>
<LI>Children who are active from the start are less likely to be
overweight throughout their lives.
<LI>Women and teenage girls can strengthen bones
through exercises like walking and running.
<LI>Adults who are active find it easier to keep a
healthy body weight.
<LI>Older adults can build muscle strength and get 
more energy through exercise.
</UL>

Thirty minutes of physical activity a day is best.  You don't need to 
do an aerobics workout or work up a sweat every time you exercise.
Housework, gardening or walking can also help you to stay fit.<p>

If you have been inactive, talk to your osteopathic physician before 
beginning an exercise program--especially if you are older, overweight
or have a medical problem.  Your doctor can suggest activities like
walking or swimming that are great for beginners.<p>

Be sure to stretch before exercising to protect yourself from injury.
Then, start to exercise slowly.  Do just a few minutes of activity 
the first day.  On the second day, add a few more minutes, and the 
next day a few more.  Soon, you'll be able to handle 30 minutes a day.<p>

<img src="hiker.gif" align=right>

Exercise with a friend so you don't lose interest.
Choose activities that you can do all year.  For example, 
if the weather keeps you from walking outside, walk on a 
treadmill.  That way, you won't get out of the habit of exercising.<p>

More active exercises like running, weight lifting, bicycling, hiking or
joining an aerobics class can also improve your health.  Whatever you do,
get off the couch and away from the television set.
Remember, some exercise is better than none at all.<p>

<font size=+2>nutrition</font><br>
<center><table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
Healthy food gives your body the energy it needs to perform.  Follow these
suggestions for smart eating and use the "Food Pyramid" as a guide to food
choices and serving sizes.<p>

<font size=+1>Carbohydrates</font><p>
You get energy to fuel vour body through the calories you eat. (A calorie
measures the energy-producing value in foods.) The best source of calories
for an active body is carbohydrates.  Carbohydrates can be found in
breads, cereals, pasta and rice (Bread Group).  They are also present in
fruits (Fruit Group) and vegetables (Vegetable Group).<p>

<font size=+1>Fruits and Vegetables</font><p>
Eating fruits and vegetables can aid in digestion and reduce your risk of
stroke.  Choose at least five foods from the fruit and vegetable groups
every day.  Vary your choices.<p>

Vitamins and minerals in your diet are important to stay healthy.  Foods
like oranges, grapefruit and tomatoes are good for you because they
contain Vitamin C.  Vitamin C can help to reduce hardening of the arteries
and high blood pressure.<p>

Cantaloupe, apricots, broccoli, carrots, spinach, squash, sweet potatoes
and tomatoes contain Vitamin A.<p>

Remember, taking vitamin pills can enrich a healthy diet, but not replace
healthy food.  Talk to your osteopathic doctor about what you eat.  If,
for example, you are anemic and you often feel tired, your doctor may
suggest an iron pill to replace the iron missing from your body.<p>

<font size=+1>Calcium</font><p>
Dairy foods like milk, cheese and yogurt as well as vegetables like
broccoli contain calcium.  Calcium builds strong bones and teeth.  To
prevent bone weakening later in life, it is especially important for women
to eat foods rich in calcium from a very early age.<p>

<font size=+1>Protein</font><p>
Protein helps to build strong muscles.  Each day, about one-third of the
calories you eat should come from foods like fish, chicken, eggs, dried
beans and peas.<p>

<IMG SRC="chart.gif" align=right>

<font size=+1>Fat</font><p>

Everyone needs some fat in their diet.  Growing children
need more than adults to stay healthy.  As an adult, too
much fat can cause you to gain weight because fat is
loaded with calories.  Limit your diet to 30 percent fat.
That means limiting fried foods like donuts, potato
chips and bacon.  Avoid fast foods and use small amounts
of salad dressing, mayonnaise, butter and margarine.<p>

You can find out the percentage of fat in a packaged food by looking at
the nutrition chart on the food label of the box or jar.  Buy foods low in
fat, so you don't eat more than 30 percent each day.<p>

Just because a food is called low-fat doesn't mean it is low in calories.
Don't eat more just because the food label says low-fat.  Some foods may
have little or no fat, but are high in sugary calories.<p>

<font size=+1>Fiber</font><p>
Eat at least one high-fiber food each day.  Fruits and vegetables, brown
breads and cereal are good sources of fiber.  A high fiber, low-fat diet
can help to prevent heart disease and some cancers like colon cancer.<p>

<font size=+1>Salt (Sodium)</font><p>
Watch the amount of salt you eat at the table and in cooking.  Read labels
to see how much salt (sodium) packaged foods contain and avoid those high
in salt.<p>

Exercise combined with a nutritious diet can help you to maintain a
healthy body weight.  When your body weight is under control and you are
not too heavy or too thin, you are at less risk of ongoing health
problems.<p>

Being overweight can make you more likely to develop heart disease, high
blood pressure, diabetes or cancer.<p>

Strict dieting to lose weight, especially by teenage girls and young adult
women, can lead to some eating disorders.  Many people who suffer from
these disorders, may refuse to admit they have a problem or do not get
treatment.  Without medical help, eating disorders can threaten your
health or even vour life.  That's why a healthy diet is so important.<p>

<font size=+1>Stress</font><p>

Everyone has stress in their life.  Stress can result
from changes in your life like a new job, moving, a
death of a loved one or even the birth of a new baby.
The difference between handling stress well and
feeling anxiety is in the way you handle change.<p>

One of the best ways to reduce stress in your life is
to make sure you get enough sleep.  Go to bed a little
earlier so you can get a good night's sleep.  A short
nap during the day (when possible) can also help you
to feel refreshed.<p>

If you can't sleep, you may need to make time to exercise.
Or, you may need to eat or drink less of foods like coffee,
colas or chocolate. These foods contain caffeine, something
that can keep you awake.  Eating sugary foods (and drinks)
before bedtime can also make it hard for some people to sleep.<p>

Here are some ways to reduce stress in your life.

<UL>
<LI>Find more quiet time to be alone.
<LI>Live in the present. (Take each day as it comes.
Do one thing at a time and don't worry about what
else needs to be done.)
<LI>Limit the rushing around. (Get up earlier so your
mornings are less hurried. Don't rush from one thing
to another.  Instead, schedule quiet time between
activities.  Make time each day to relax and get
organized.)
<LI>Remind yourself that other people can't make
you angry.  Only your mind can do that.
<LI>Don't blame things, people, or yourself for stress.
Change your way of thinking.
</UL>

<font size=+1>Depression</font><p>

If you don't learn to handle stress well, you could suffer
mild or more serious depression.  However, depression does 
not always come from the way you react to stress.  Sometimes
it is simply a condition that can be treated with therapy and/or
drugs.  If you have at least five of these symptoms almost 
every day for at least two weeks, the cause could be depression.<p>

<UL>

<LI>Sadness almost every day
<LI>Loss of interest or pleasure in most activities
<LI>A change in your weight or appetite
<LI>Sleeplessness
<LI>Feeling tired or having no energy
<LI>Feeling worthless or very guilty
<LI>Unable to concentrate
<LI>Repeated thoughts of suicide
</UL>

Talk to your physician if you think you or a family member may be 
showing signs of depression.<P>

Cigarette smoking can put you at risk of heart disease,
heart attack, stroke, and lung cancer.  Smoking while

In America, smoking accounts for one in five deaths

Vaccines are the best protection against disease for your and your
family.  By taking advantage of vaccines, you give you and your
family a special gift.  You may have heard the saying, "When you
have your health you have everything."  Vaccines are a great way
to protect your health.<p>

This page talks about how vaccines prevent illnesses in children
and adults.  It explains who should and shouldn't be vaccinated.
Finally, it includes a list of what vaccinations your children
should have, and when they should have them.<p>

Feel free to ask your doctor any questions you have about vaccination.
He or she will work with you to protect your family's health.<p>

<font size=+2>how vaccines work</font><br>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
<!--    -->

<img src="vaccin2.gif" align=right>

Vaccines make the body produce disease fighters
known as "antibodies," which move through the blood
like "soldiers" preventing invasion of the body by
germs.<p>

Vaccines are commonly recommended to prevent the 
following diseases:<br>

<UL>
<LI>Measles, Mumps, and Rubelia (German measles)
<LI>Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (whooping cough)
<LI><i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b
<LI>Varicella (chickenpox)
<LI>Hepatitis A
<LI>Hepatitis B
<LI>Polio
<LI>Influenza (commonly referred to as "the flu")
<LI>Pneumonia (caused by certain bacteria)
</UL>

Vaccines prevent illnesses and their serious effects.
For example, in a very small number of cases, measles
can lead to brain damage or even death.  Mumps can
cause an infection of the coverings of the brain and
spinal cord called meningitis. If a pregnant woman gets
German measles, her baby can be born blind or deaf or
with other serious problems.<p>

Other dangerous results include becoming paralyzed from
diphtheria, locking of the jaw from tetanus, liver damage
from hepatitis and brain damage or death from whooping
cough.<p>

So, you can see how vaccines are important for you and
your family.<p>

<font size=+2>should you and your family get 
vaccinated?</font><br>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
<!--    -->
Vaccines make sense because they can help you
and your family live normal, healthy lives.  For example,
because of the smallpox vaccine this once deadly
disease has been almost completely wiped out.  The
number of cases of diphtheria in the United States has
decreased from over 200,000 in 1921 to only 24 cases
from 1980 to 1989. Other diseases, like polio, have
also been just about eliminated.  To keep these diseases
from coming back, though, it's very important to get
vaccinated.<p>

Like all medicines, there are possible side effects
(such as allergic reactions, fever or rash) connected
with vaccines.  The benefits of vaccines are usually
much greater than the risks.  Your osteopathic physician
will discuss those with you before giving the vaccination.
If you have any questions, be sure to ask.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus Vaccine:</font><p>

Children under 7 years.  Those older than 7 and adults should
receive only diphtheria and tetanus vaccines.  To make sure the
protection lasts, a booster dose of the diphtheria and tetanus
vaccine should be given every 10 years.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000"><I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> type b Vaccine:</font><p>

Infants at least 2 months old.  Children over 5 should not receive

Anyone over 12 months old who has not had chicken pox.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Hepatitis A Vaccine:</font><p>

Anyone over 2 years of age who may be exposed to the disease
by travelling to Africa, Asia (not including Japan, Korea and
Hong Kong), eastern, southeastern and parts of southern Europe,
Mexico and parts of the Caribbean.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Hepatitis B Vaccine:</font><p>

Anyone who has not had the disease.  Adults who are healthcare
workers are more likely to be exposed to hepatitis B.<p>

Babies, children and teenagers up to 18 years old.  Because
there are three types of polio virus, even people who have had
polio should be vaccinated.  The vaccine protects against all
three forms of polio.<p>

<img src="hibldpr2.gif" align=right>
High blood pressure or hypertension is often called the "silent killer"
because in most cases, it has no warning signs.  In fact, you could
have high blood pressure for years and never know it because you feel
fine.  However, without treatment hypertension can make your heart work
too hard, damage your blood vessels and put you at risk of heart failure,
heart attack, stroke, kidney failure or blindness.  That's why it is 
important to have your doctor check your blood pressure at least once
a year.<p>

<hr>

<font size=+2>what is high blood pressure and how is it measured?</font><br>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
<!--    -->
Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing
against the walls of your arteries.  When your heart
beats, blood is pushed through your body with greater
force.  This is known as systolic pressure.  Between beats
when your heart is at rest, there is less force of blood
against your arteries.  This is called diastolic pressure.<p>

Taking your blood pressure is easy.  To do this, your
doctor wraps the cuff of the blood pressure meter
around your upper arm and tightens it by pumping air
into it.  When the air is released, the doctor can read
your blood pressure.  A reading ranging from 110/60 to
140/90 (systolic over diastolic) is considered normal.   
If your blood pressure is always beyond this range, you
may have high blood pressure.<p>

<font size=+2>what are the dangers of high blood pressure?</font><br>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
<!--    -->

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Heart Disease and Heart Failure</font><p>

 High blood pressure makes your heart work harder
 than usual.  This may cause the heart muscle to
 increase in size.  Eventually, an enlarged heart may
 not be able to handle this increased workload and
 heart disease may occur.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Heart Attack</font><p>

 The blood carries life-giving oxygen to the heart muscle.
 Hypertension can cause fatty deposits to build up
 on blood vessel walls, limiting the flow of blood and
 oxygen to the heart.  In time, a reduced blood supply
 to the heart can damage the heart muscle and cause
 a heart attack.<p>


<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Stroke</font><p>

 Long-term high blood pressure can cause a stroke.
 This happens when fatty deposits build up inside the
 artery leading to the brain and limit the flow of blood
 oxygen.  Increased blood pressure can then make
 the artery burst or weaken it enough for a blood clot
 to form.  In either case, this could lead to a stroke.<p>


<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Kidney Failure</font><p>

Hypertension can also lead to hardening of the outer
walls of the arteries.  This keeps blood from reaching
the kidneys. If the kidneys can't remove body waste,
kidney failure can happen.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Blindness</font><p>
 
If blood vessels in your eyes are constantly strained
and swollen due to high blood pressure, you could
become blind.<p>

</td></tr></table></center>

<font size=+2>what risks for hypertension are
 out of your control?</font><br>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
<!--    -->

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Heredity</font><p>

High blood pressure runs in many families.  If your
parents or other close blood relatives have had 
hypertension, you are more likely to get it.<p>

<img src="hibldpr3.gif" align=right>
<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Race</font><p>

High blood pressure among African Americans is more
common than among white Americans and frequently
occurs earlier and more severely.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Age</font><p>

Many times, hypertension affects people over age 35.
Men seem to get high blood pressure between the ages
of 35 and 50, while women are more likely to develop
hypertension after menopause.<p>


</td></tr></table></center>

<hr>


<font size=+2>what can you do to reduce your 
risk of high blood pressure?</font><br>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>

For most people with high blood pressure there
is no known cause. But there are ways to reduce
your risk.<p>

Watch your weight.  If you weigh 30 percent
or more above your ideal body weight, you are
more likely to develop hypertension.<p>
</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>

<img src="drink.gif" align=right>
Drink no more than 3 drinks
or 3 oz. of alcohol a day
because it can increase your
blood pressure.  One beer,
one high ball or one glass of
wine each contain I oz. of alcohol.<p>

</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>
<img src="grease.gif" align=left>
Eat foods that are low in fat,
cholesterol and salt.  Avoid fried
food and red meat. Limit the use
of butter, oil and fat in cooking and
eat a lot of fruits, vegetables, whole
grain cereals, rice and breads.<p>

</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>
<img src="smoke.gif" align=right>
Don't smoke. Although
smoking doesn't cause
hypertension, it can
increase your risk of
heart disease and stroke.<p>
</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>
<img src="hibldpr4.gif" align=left>
Exercise regularly.  Try to get 30
minutes of activity at least three to
four times a week.  Without exercise, it
is easier to become overweight, increasing
your blood pressure.<p>

If you often feel stressed, take time to relax.
</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>
Ask your osteopathic physician to determine your ideal
body weight, recommend a healthy diet and exercise program,
and suggest ways to reduce stress.

</td></tr></table></center>



<hr>


<font size=+2>what's the best treatment for hypertension?</font><br>
<center><table width = 85%><tr><td><b>

Although many health care professionals can measure
your blood pressure, only your doctor can keep an
eye on high blood pressure and decide what treatment
is best for you.  Most doctors recommend a combination
of diet, exercise and medicine.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Diet</font><p>
Because being overweight can contribute to hypertension,
your doctor may recommend a low fat, low cholesterol diet.
Follow the meal plan closely and limit the amount of alcohol
you drink.  Remember, alcohol is high in calories and can 
keep you from losing weight.<p>

Sometimes reducing the amount of salt you eat can
help to lower your blood pressure.  That means avoiding
salty foods and cutting down on the amount of salt you
use at the table.  Watch how much salt you use in
cooking, and read food labels to learn how much salt
(sodium) is in packaged foods.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Exercise</font><p>

Don't be afraid of exercise or physical activity if you
have high blood pressure.  Hypertension should not
limit your everyday activities. Combined with a low
fat diet, exercise can help you to lose weight.  Ask your
osteopathic physician about exercises and activities
that are right for you.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Medicine</font><p>

If weight loss, exercise and a low-salt diet do not lower
your blood pressure, medicine may be necessary.  Listen
to your doctor's orders and follow them carefully.  Take
your blood pressure medicine regularly. Never skip a
dose or stop taking it if you feel well.  If the medicine
makes you sick, contact your physician immediately.<p>

Be sure to keep all doctor's appointments so you can
see if the medicine is working for you.  If you must
cancel an appointment, reschedule another one as
soon as possible.<p>

Although for the most part, high blood pressure can't
be cured, it can be controlled.  Working closely with
your osteopathic physician, you can learn to live with
hypertension and reduce your risk of heart failure,
heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and blindness.

As a parent, nothing is more important to you than your
child's well-being.  Whether you have a baby or an active
5-year-old, there are simple steps you can take to protect
your child's health and safety.  This page tells you
how.  Here you'll find the latest medical advice on topics
such as car safety, common childhood illnesses, preventing
accidents, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, vaccinations and
other typical concerns of parents of young children.<p>

Of course, this page should not be used as a substitute for
the advice of your physician.  Feel free to ask any questions
you have about your child's care.  Your doctor will work with
you to protect your family's health.<p>

<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Bike Safety</font><p>

<img src="child3.gif" align=right>
Children should never ride bikes without wearing a helmet to
protect them from head injuries or death.  Children should not
ride bikes in the street without an adult.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Burns</font><p>

<UL>
<LI>Don't carry your baby and hot liquids or foods at the same time.
<LI>Reduce the temperature of your hot water heater to between
120&#176; F and 125&#176; F to prevent scalds and never leave your child
alone in the bathtub.
<LI>In the kitchen, turn all handles of pots and pans on the stove
toward the rear.
<LI>Keep toddlers and young children away from the stove when you
are cooking.  Remember that ovens and other hot surfaces such as
irons and space heaters can burn your child long after you've shut
them off.<p>
</UL>
<hr>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Car Seats/Car Safety</font><p>

<img src="child4.gif" align=left>
Car crashes are the leading cause of death and injury among children
in the United States.  You can protect your child by using a car
safety seat.  Babies and children weighing up to 65 pounds should
always ride in a car safety seat, starting with the first ride home
from the hospital.  (Children weighing more than 65 pounds should
use seat belts.)<p>
<center>
<img src="child5.gif">
</center>
<hr>
<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Choking</font><p>
<img src="child6.gif" align=right>
Babies learn about their world by putting things into their mouths.
<UL>
<LI>Make sure that all small objects are out of your
baby's reach.
<LI>Always cut the foods you feed your baby into small pieces
no larger than a nickel.  Never feed your baby hard pieces of
food such as chunks of raw carrots, hot dogs or grapes.
<LI>Your baby can pull off and swallow adhesive bandages.
Always remove them before putting your baby in a car seat or 
down for a nap.
<LI>Remove all strings from hooded jackets and sweatshirts.
They can stangle your baby if they are yanked or pulled too tightly.
<LI>Don't let babies or young children play with plastic bags,
balloons or plastic wrappers.  They can choke on them.
</UL>
<hr>
<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Drowning</font><p>

<img src="child7.gif" align=left>  Babies and toddlers can
drown in as little as two inches of water.  Never leave
your baby or toddler alone in the bathtub, even for a
second.  Keep your child away from cleaning buckets,
swimming pool covers and other objects that collect water,
and toilets.  (Use safety latches to keep toilet lids down.)
Keep a close watch on children when they are swimming.  Fence
in swimming pools and lock the gates when not in use.<p>

<hr>
<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Falls</font><p>
Even young babies can squirm and push against things with their
hands and feet.  Never leave your baby alone on a changing table,
bed or chair.  Place gates at the top and bottom of stairwells.
Don't use baby walkers.  They are unsafe and can lead to
accidents.  Use window guards on all windows above the first
floor.  Be sure the surface under swingsets and other play
equipment is soft enough to cushion a fall.<p>

<hr>
<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Firearms</font><p>
<img src="child9.gif" align=left>
Every two hours in the U.S., a child is killed with a loaded
gun.  The safest thing is not to have a gun in your home.
If you do have one, always keep it unloaded and locked up.
Lock and store bullets in a separate place.  Even if you
don't own a gun, teach your child NOT to play with guns
at a friend's house or anywhere else.<p>

<hr>
<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Fire Safety</font><p>
Dress your child in snug-fitting, flame-retardant
pajamas.  Loose pajamas, even those specially treated to
resist flames, are more dangerous than pajamas that
are tight-fitting. (Loose clothing allows more oxygen,
which feeds the fire to circulate around your child's
body.) Be sure to have at least one working smoke alarm
for each floor of your house.  Test the batteries in your
smoke alarms once a month, and change them at least
once a year.  Plan an escape route from your home in
case of fire.  Do fire drills as a family.<p>

<hr>
<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Poisons</font><p>

Keep all medicines, household cleaners and poisons
locked up and completely out of sight and reach.  Use
safety caps on all medicines and safety latches on
cabinets where you store cleaning products.  Attach
your Poison Control Center telephone number to your
phone.  If your child does swallow something poisonous
call your Poison Control Center or physician
immediately.<p>

<center>
<img src="child8.gif"></center>


<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)/"Crib
 Death"</font><p>

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of death among
infants under 1 year.  No one knows what causes SIDS, but here are ways
you can reduce your baby's risk:<p>

<img src="childa.gif" align=right>
<UL>
<LI>Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, always place your
baby on his back or side to sleep, even if it's just for a nap.
<LI>Make sure your baby is sleeping on a firm mattress.  Don't 
use fluffy blankets or pillows under your baby and keep stuffed 
animals out of the crib.
<LI>Don't allow cigarette smoking around your baby.  It increases
the risk of SIDS.
</UL>

<hr>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Vaccinations</font><p>

Vaccinations save thousands of lives every year.  Thanks to vaccines,
killer diseases such as smallpox, measles, typhoid, whooping cough
and polio are less common than they used to be in the United States.
Consult with your physician about the recommended vaccination schedule
for your child.

<center>

<img src="smartm2.gif" align=right>
Too often men think, "It won't happen to me."  But health
problems like prostate enlargement, prostate cancer, impotence
and low testosterone are more common among men than you think.
Staying healthy throughout your life means learning about
health risks and taking the time to have regular examinations
by your physician.<p>
</td></tr></table></center>
<hr><br>

<font size=+2>prostate enlargement or benign prostatic
hyperplasia (bph)</font>  (be-nine pros-ta-tic hi-per pla-zia)<p>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
The prostate is a gland - about the size of a
walnut - that forms part of the male reproductive system.
The prostate gland lies inside the body at the base of the
penis, just below the bladder and near the rectum.  It
surrounds the urethra (a canal inside the penis that
urine or semen passes through as it leaves the body).<p>

<img src="smartm3.gif" align=right>

The prostate's main role is to release a milky fluid
that is part of semen.  As you mature, it goes through
two main growth periods. The first happens early in
puberty, when the prostate doubles in size.  At around
age 25, the gland begins to grow again and continues to
grow throughout your life.  As you age, it is common for
the prostate to grow larger.<p>

As the prostate enlarges, it cannot expand because of its
location in the Body (see diagram).  This causes it to grow
inward and press against the urethra like a clamp on a garden
hose.  That means you can have trouble urinating.<p>

Over time, the bladder, behind the prostate gland, may not
empty itself completely.  A poorly functioning bladder can
cause:<br>

<UL>
<LI>A hesitant or weak stream of urine
<LI>Leaking between trips to the bathroom and
<LI>The need to urinate more often, especially at night
</UL>

Such strain on the bladder can lead to infection, bladder or
kidney damage, bladder stones and being unable to control
urination.  If you have trouble urinating, tell your doctor
as soon as possible.  For most men, BPH rarely causes 
problems before age 40.<p>
</td></tr></table></center>

<font size=+2>how can my doctor find and treat prostate
enlargement early?</font><p>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
<center><img src="smartm4.gif"></center>
Regular checkups beginning at the age of 40 are the best
way to guard against the harmful effects of prostate
enlargement.  If you get a urinary tract infection because
of BPH, your physician may prescribe an antibiotic drug first.<p>

After your infection is gone, your doctor will try to slow
prostate growth.  For some men, drug treatment may help.  For others,
a thin tube with a balloon must be placed inside the penis and
inflated.  This helps to widen the urethra and allows urine to
flow more freely.<p>

In most severe cases, surgery to clear the clogged urethra is
the <I>best</I> way to prevent more damage to the bladder.</b>
</td></tr></table></center>
<hr><br>


<font size=+2>prostate cancer</font><p>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among American men and
is second only to lung cancer as the leading cause of male cancer
death.  Although scientists have not discovered the cause of
prostate cancer, they do know your risk increases with age and that
African American men are more likely to develop the disease.</b>

<font size=+2>what are the signs and symptoms
of prostate cancer?</font><p>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
There are no symptoms for the early stages of prostate cancer.  When
symptoms do develop, they may be confused with those of an 
enlarged prostate.<p>

Although some of the signs of prostate cancer and
prostate enlargement (BPH) are the same, having BPH
does not seem to increase your chance of getting prostate
cancer.  Nevertheless, the American Cancer Society suggests
that all men 40 years of age and older have a physical
examination every year that includes a digital rectal
exam.  This finger exam is quick and painless and it can
help your doctor find prostate cancer or prostate
enlargement before the condition becomes serious.
</b></td></tr></table></center>
<hr><br>




<font size=+2>what else can you do to protect yourself?</font><p>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>

After age 50, ask your doctor for a prostate specific
antigen (PSA) blood test and a digital rectal exam
during your annual check-up.  A rise in your PSA level
could mean an enlarged or infected prostate, or that
you are at a higher risk of cancer.<p>

If you are an African American man with a family
history of prostate cancer, you should have both a PSA
blood test and a digital rectal exam beginning at age 40.<p>

Only your doctor can tell the difference between
prostate enlargement and prostate cancer.  Don't put
your health at risk by being too embarrassed or too
busy to get checked.  Remember, early treatment is the
key to protecting yourself from the most serious and
sometimes deadly effects of prostate enlargement or
prostate cancer.<p>

<font size=+2>impotence or erectile dysfunction</font><br>

Impotence is a man's inability to have an erection.  Here are
a few of the many physical causes for impotence:

<UL><LI>Alcoholism and drug use
<LI>Diabetes
<LI>Hypogonadism (a condition that leads to lower
testosterone levels)
<LI>Medications that lower blood pressure or treat depression
</UL>

<img src="smartm5.gif" align=right>

The way impotence is treated depends on what is causing it.
Impotence from a physical cause may improve when the condition
is treated or controlled.<p>

No matter what causes it, counseling can be very helpful.
Impotence can affect how you feel about yourself and how
you and your sex partner relate to one another.<p>

<font size=+2>low testosterone</font><p>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
Testosterone is a hormone that is responsible for the
normal development of male physical characteristics like
a deep voice, facial and chest hair.  It also affects a
man's sexual drive and his ability to have an erection.
Low testosterone can make you feel tired and moody or
depressed.<p></b>

<font size=+2>hypogonadism</font><br>
(hi-po-go-nad-ism)<p>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
Male hypogonadism is a condition in which the
body produces poor levels of testosterone.  Low levels
of testosterone before birth may cause a male baby to
have undeveloped sex organ outside of his body.<p>

At puberty, a boy with hypogonadism may have:

<UL>
<LI>Undeveloped sexual organs
<LI>Delayed puberty (or never go through puberty)
<LI>A high-pitched voice
<LI>Little or no hair on his chest, face or pubic area and
<LI>An uneven spread of fat cells throughout the body.
</UL>

After puberty, if a man develops hypogonadism,
he may experience:

<UL>
<LI>A decrease in the size of his prostate
<LI>A loss of body hair (especially chest and pubic hair)
<LI>Impotence
<LI>Fine wrinkles around the eyes
<LI>Yellowish skin
<LI>A depressed mood
</UL>

If left untreated, male hypogonadism may cause:

<UL><LI>Mild anemia (a lack of red blood cells)
<LI>Wasting away of muscles
<LI>Osteoporosis (a disorder that causes "bone loss"
so severe that the bones weaken and break early)
</UL>

Hypogonadism can develop as the result of trauma, infection,
age, Klinefelter's syndrome (an inherited disease affecting
men marked by breast enlargement, infertility and small testicles)
or pituitary disease.<p>

Ask your doctor about hormone treatments that can be work
in the form of a patch on your abdomen, back, thigh or upper
arm.  As the patch releases small amounts of testosterone
into your body, it raises your testosterone level to a more
healthy level.<p>

<font size=+2>male breast cancer</font><p>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
Although it is rare, the American Cancer Society predicts that
1,400 men will get breast cancer this year.  You are at risk of
breast cancer if you:

<UL><LI>Are diagnosed with Klinefelter's syndrome
<LI>Have a disease that increases the level of estrogen
in the body.  (Estrogen is a hormone that can allow
some tumors to grow.)
</UL>

Remember, there is no evidence that breast enlargement due to
being overweight causes breast cancer in men.  However, if you
believe you are at risk, don't be embarrassed.  Instead, talk
to your doctor about your fears and get help as soon as possible.<p>

Today women enjoy longer, healthier lives than ever before.
In just one century a woman's life expectancy has increased
from 50 to 80 years of age.  That means by taking care of
yourself, you can expect to live more than 30 years after
menopause.<p>

</b></td></tr></table></center>




<font size=+2>menopause</font><br>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>

Menopause or the "change of life" is the time in
a woman's life when monthly menstrual periods stop.
During this time, your ovaries make smaller amounts
of two hormones called estrogen and progesterone.
Menopause occurs in most women around the age of
51.  You can expect to start menopause at about the
same age as your mother did.  However, menopause
can happen any time between your late 30s and
your late 50s.<p>

Aside from not getting your period, menopause
can bring about a number of symptoms that vary from
woman to woman:
<UL>
<LI>Your periods may stop all at once, or they may
become irregular before stopping altogether.
<LI>You may suffer hot flashes or night sweats.
<LI>After menopause your cholesterol levels may rise.
<LI>The lining of your vagina may become thin
and dry.  This can cause pain during or after sex.
Over time, menopause may cause bladder
control problems.  You may need to urinate more
often.  Some women may leak urine when they
cough or sneeze.
<LI>When menopause causes estrogen to drop,
bones may become brittle.
<LI>As you age your body loses calcium. Your bones
can weaken and put you at risk of a fracture.
This kind of severe "bone loss" is called
osteoporosis.
</UL>

The kind and seriousnes of symptoms you have
during and after menopause is unique to you.  About
85 percent of women have some symptoms.  The rest
have none, except the stopping of their periods.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Should I take hormone pills?</font><p>

Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is the use of
pills, patches, implants or vaginal creams to restore
estrogen and other hormones lost during and after
menopause.  HRT has many benefits.  For some women,
it can relieve uncomfortable symptoms such as:

<UL>
<LI>Hot flashes
<LI>Night sweats, or
<LI>Vaginal dryness.
</UL>

Like all treatments, HRT isn't right for everyone.  The
only way to make the right decision for you is to discuss
your health with your doctor today.  Because you should 
feel comfortable about your decision to have
hormone replacement therapy, don't be afraid to talk
to your doctor about your concerns. Here are some
commonly asked questions and answers.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">If I choose
 HRT will I get breast cancer?</font><p>
There is no proven link between HRT and breast cancer.  
The usual dose of estrogen after menopause will
not increase your risk of breast cancer.  However, if you
or anyone in your family has had breast cancer, be
sure to let your doctor know before beginning to
take estrogen.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Does HRT 
cause uterine cancer?</font><p>

The risk of cancer in the lining of the uterus increases
when estrogen is taken alone, in large amounts, over a
long period of time. That's why a combination of estrogen
and progestin hormones provides the benefits of
hormone replacement therapy while reducing the risk
of uterine cancer. (The uterus is the organ within a
woman's body in which a baby grows before birth.)<p>

If you have had your uterus removed, there is no risk
of developing uterine cancer and no benefit to using a
product that combines estrogen and progestin.<p>

</b></td></tr></table></center>



<font size=+2>osteoporosis</font><br>
<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>
Osteoporosis is a disorder that slowly weakens
bones.  Over time, it can make your bones so fragile
they may break.  Osteoporosis can cause bones, 
especially in your spine, wrists and hips, to become frail.
Once one of these bones breaks, the result may be:<p>

<img src="smartw3.gif" align=right>
<UL>
<LI>Pain,
<LI>Height loss,
<LI>Difficulty moving,
<LI>A deformed backbone that curves forward, or
<LI>A lifelong disability.
</UL>

Every woman has some "bone loss" as she grows
older.  Throughout life, your body breaks down old
bone and rebuilds new bone.  Severe "bone loss" or
osteoporosis means you are losing the material inside
the bone that makes it dense and thick.<p>

If you are less than 30 years old, it is especially
important to eat foods rich in calcium now.  Ask your
doctor about calcium supplements.  Walk, run or do
weight lifting exercises every day and work toward
maintaining your ideal body weight.  If you have
already reached menopause, now is the time to talk
to your doctor about ways to curb the effects
of osteoporosis.<p>

<H1>AOA DIVISIONAL SOCIETIES</H1>
<H2>July, 1996</H2>
</center><P>

<b>
Divisional societies of the American Osteopathic Association have been organized in almost every state, but of course their available services vary greatly according to DO population in the state. In addition to services listed below, please note that societies in states with a low DO population are eligible for certain additional services through the AOA Department of Public Relations. Services to "priority states" include:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Physician placement program, providing practice location assistance<BR>
<LI>Free literature, up to 200 copies of each available item<BR>
<LI>Loan of an AOA exhibit for important state meetings<BR>
<LI>PR counseling<BR>
<LI>Mail coverage of state convention<BR>
<LI>Assistance in special state projects<BR>
<LI>Student recruitment program<BR>
</OL>

The number of DO members of each divisional society are almost all from the records of the societies. Further information can be obtained in the statistical section of this directory.<BR>
At the end of the state listings are addresses and officers for recognized foreign societies. Also appended is a listing for a Canadian provincial group that is an AOA divisional society.<BR>

<H3>ANTI-AGING MEDICINE: D.O.s HELP PATIENTS TAP INTO FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH</H3>
</center>
<br><p>

(Chicago) -- Its the stuff of magazine articles.  Pharmacy shelves.  And health food stores.  Youth is always in fashion, and people will do almost anything to retain it, according to an article in the June issue of The DO.   With scientists now uncovering the biological factors that contribute to aging, the fountain of youth may be closer than you think.<p>

During the past decade, research in the area of aging has been profound, noted Thomas Cavalieri, D.O., Director of the Center for Aging, and chairman of medicine at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey School of Osteopathic Medicine (UMDNJ-SOM), Stratford.  We have a better understanding of which age-related problems are due to normal aging and which are due to lifestyle choices and environmental causes.  We also have a better understanding of ways to prevent or delay the development of age-related problems.<p>

Much of the current research into aging is based upon the free radical theory.  Developed in 1987, the theory states that the bodys use of oxygen results in the production of toxic byproducts or free radicals.  These are oxygen molecules with surplus electrons.  When free radicals unite with other molecules in an organism, the results include damage to cells and the DNA within the cells.  The rate of free radical production increases with age, so many of the bodys age-related changes can be attributed to free radicals.<p>

Cellular damage can also result from outside sources of free radicals, such as air pollution, tobacco smoke, pesticides and radiation, according to Edmund R. Tyska, D.O., a family physician and public health expert in Irving, Texas.<p>

We are surrounded by a chemical sea, but our bodies are not defenseless, explained Dr. Tyska.  To protect against free radicals, the human body creates endogenous enzymes called free radical scavengers.  These include superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase.  Free radical scavengers are the bodys natural antioxidants.<p>

Free radical scavengers are the bodys natural antioxidants.<p>

Though antioxidants are enjoying tremendous popularity today, physicians warn that they should be taken with caution, and under medical supervision, since they can be harmful if misused.<p>

The role of hormones in the aging process is also of interest to researchers.<p>

Some of the most exciting research right now focuses on hormone replacement therapy, stated Ronald Klatz, D.O., president and co-founder of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine.  Estrogen replacement therapy, for example, proved very effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women.  And testosterone and growth hormone also have shown promise.<p>

Dr. Tyska noted that he freely prescribes hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women to reduce their chance of developing osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease.  But we have hardly scratched the surface of male hormone replacement, he admitted.<p>

Dr. Klatz believes that more research in this area is needed, stating that middle-age men go through andropause.  Though milder than menopause, andropause is characterized by a significant decrease in testosterone production.  This decrease is associated with a lowered sexual drive, decreased muscle mass, increase in intra-abdominal fat, and heightened risk of developing atherosclerosis.<p>

Research in this area shows that hormone replacement therapy might positively impact andropause.  The benefits of testosterone replacement therapy include stimulation of muscle and bone growth, improvement in healing time, restoration of sexual potency and a renewed feeling of energy, Dr. Klatz stated.<p>

Dr. Klatz is also impressed with growth hormone therapy.  It appears to improve wound healing, increase muscle mass and improve psychological energy, he explained.<p>

Other hormones that may prove beneficial to anti-aging include melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), according to recent research.<p>

DHEA is a precursor hormone, usually transformed into another hormone, estrogen or testosterone.  Though DHEAs role in aging remains unclear, studies indicate that DHEA replacement therapy increases strength, vigor and immune response.   Melatonin has been widely promoted as a sleep aid, though researchers believe that reduced production of melatonin results in changes in the endocrine system that may affect the aging process.<p>

While Dr. Klatz recognizes that further hormone replacement therapy research is needed, he is confident that it will one day play a major role in anti-aging medicine.  Typically, hormone production begins to drop off significantly between the ages of 30 and 40, he explained.  Hormone replacement therapy may become as important to aging patients as insulin injections are to diabetics.<p>

Dr. Klatz believes that by slowing the onset of aging, people can also slow the onset of age-related diseases, such as stroke, osteoporosis, heart disease, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, autoimmune disorders and some forms of cancer.  He founded the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine with Robert Martin Goldman, D.O., PhD, three years ago.<p>

In their recently published book, Stopping the Clock, Drs. Goldman and Klatz describe how physicians may soon be able to slow the aging process with anti-aging treatments such as hormone replacement therapy, biomarker analysis and genetic engineering.<p>

While other osteopathic physicians are excited at the youth-preserving potential of hormones, all agree that additional research is needed.<p>

Theres no question that adequate hormonal and immunologic mechanisms confer immunity to disease.  But no trial has produced findings that would enable us to implement hormone therapy as an anti-aging treatment, noted Katherine E. Galluzi, D.O., chairman of geriatrics at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine.  We dont know yet what the maintenance of hormonal levels will do.<p>

In their efforts to better understand the aging process, researchers are also re-evaluating the longtime correlation between aging and disease.<p>

Chronic, degenerative diseases had been thought to be part of the aging process.  Thats not true, noted 86-year-old Irvin Korr, PhD, a neurophysiologist who taught at three osteopathic medical colleges between 1945 and 1989.  For the most part, chronic, degenerative diseases are preventable.  So what happens in the aging process is not necessarily dependent on disease.  Aging is a natural process.<p>

In keeping with the osteopathic approach to care, D.O.s and their patients are working together to slow the aging process and improve the quality of life.  People are beginning to understand that they can do many things to stay healthy and live longer, explained Dr. Tyska.  The power to choose our actions gives us an incredible ability to create the quality and length of the life we want.  By wisely choosing our
behavior, we can extend our youth far beyond what was once considered possible.<p>

People can help to slow the aging process through exercise, sufficient sleep and stress reduction, according to Dr. Tyska.<p>

Dr. Galuzzi agrees that a healthy lifestyle may be the key to living longer.  Individuals should strive for continued health into old age.  The goal is to improve active life expectancy, she stressed. She advises her elderly patients to take vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and calcium to help prevent osteoporosis.  She
also encourages them to do aerobic exercises and moderate weight lifting to build muscle mass.<p>

When dealing with elderly patients who experience age-related health problems such as arthritis, hypertension, hypotension and loss of hearing or vision, physicians should focus not as much on the health problems, but on how they affect the patients day-to-day functioning, recommended Francis A. Komara, D.O., chairman of geriatrics at the Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine, North Miami Beach, FL.<p>

Im most concerned about maintaining the functional status of elderly patients who live at home, Dr. Komara stated.  It is essential that the elderly maintain social contacts and participate in daily activities.<p>

Other osteopathic physicians agree that social interaction plays an important role in preserving vitality among the elderly.<p>

Health in old age is not merely the absence of disease.  Health in old age is a matrix of maintained functions, explained Dr. Galuzzi.  When a person becomes isolated or withdrawn, that person ages.  The elements that give quality to an active life are meaningful relationships, an interest in and a passion for life, and continued learning.<p>

Wayne Carlson, D.O., head of geriatrics at the Ohio University College of Osteopathic medicine, Athens, agrees.  Our focus in clinical geriatrics is not to see how long we can make people live.  Our focus is helping older patients to live better, he stated.  The goal is to add life to years, not years to life.<p>

Dr. Klatz predicts that as the nations population ages, so, too, will research into anti-aging medicine.  According to the US Census Bureau, by the year 200, people over age 65 will make up 13% of the nations population, and 20% by the year 2025.<p>

The thrust of anti-aging research should continue to be exploring ways of preventing and slowing the physical debilitation that occurs with aging so that peoples final years are healthier and more productive, said Dr. Cavalieri.<P>

<H3>OSTEOPATHIC PHYSICIAN DIRECTS EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AT 96
SUMMER OLYMPIC GAMES</H3>
</center>
<br><p>

(Chicago, IL) -- Osteopathic physicians who are part of the emergency medical services team at the 96 Summer Games will be adding a new dimension to healthcare for this years Olympic athletes.<p>

Eric Deal, D.O., director of emergency medicine for the Olympic Village, said that osteopathic manipulative medicine could be an added bonus for athletes.  Since some injuries sustained by athletes may involve sprains, strains, or other soft tissue injuries, Dr. Deal believes that incorporating osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) into their care could prove beneficial.<p>

OMT is a hands-on diagnosis and treatment tool used exclusively by osteopathic physicians.  It is predicated on the osteopathic emphasis on the musculoskeletal system and its interrrelationship with other body systems.  Using OMT, D.O.s apply slight to moderate pressure on affected areas of the body to help restore movement and proper function.  Because OMT enhances the bodys ability to heal itself, it reduces
-- and often eliminates -- the need for medication or surgery, and may hasten the athletes return to the playing field.<p>

Osteopathic medicine is a patient-centered, whole person approach to medicine.  D.O.s are fully trained and licensed to prescribe medication, perform surgery, and specialize in every known area of medicine, from neurosurgery to pediatrics, across the nation.  Their unique training in OMT enables D.O.s to provide the most comprehensive care available today.  Their respect for and emphasis on appropriate functtion of the musculoskeletal system makes D.O.s a natural fit for athletes and sports medicine.<p>

While injuries suffered by athletes may be painful, physicians treating olympiads will face equally painful decisions, including whether to pull a sick or injured athlete from competition.<p>

The Olympic Games provide an arena for athletes to shine after years of dedication to their sport, explained Dr. Deal.  The last thing athletes want to hear is that an injury or illness is too severe to allow them to compete.  Our primary concern, however, is their health.<p>

Dr. Deal, director of emergency services for three Atlanta hospitals, was asked to direct emergency medicine at the Polyclinic, a unique, multi-specialty medical complex located inside the Olympic Village that will treat athletes and their families.<p>

Because of the availability of medical resources in the Atlanta area, this is the first time in Olympic history that a medical clinic like this has been assembled, Dr. Deal explained.  The Polyclinic will be one of the benchmarks of the Atlanta games.<p>

Dr. Deal assembled a team of more than a dozen emergency practitioners to work behind the scenes, bandaging, monitoring and keeping athletes healthy so they can go for the gold.  Two other osteopathic physicians will join Dr. Deal at the Summer Games.  Stephen Burkholz, D.O., and Mark Rosing, D.O., both Atlanta-based physicians, will be a part of the emergency medical services team.<p>

New equipment and extra staff have been added to the existing Georgia Tech University Student Health Center to transform it into a clinic that will provide 24-hour emergency medical coverage.  Dr. Deal stated that his medical team is ready to handle a broad range of medical emergencies, including chest and abdominal pain, sprains, heat-related illnesses and traumatic injuires.<p>

Providing emergency medical care for the athletes and their families will be even more complicated than the care we provide in normal emergency room situations for many reasons, said Dr. Deal.<p>

He cited cultural and language barriers among the anticipated complications.  In addition, medical personnel will consult a 60-page list of allowable medications before prescribing to athletes.<p>

Dr. Deal, a 1981 graduate of the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine, is honored to use his osteopathic medical education to care for Olympic athletes.<p>

This opportunity to work with the top athletes in the world is a once in a lifetime opportunity, he said.  Being trusted to make medical decisions for those athletes is a great responsibility that my education and experience have prepared me for.<p>

Dr. Deal is a member of the American Osteopathic Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and the National Association of EMS Physicians.<p>

<H3>SMITHKLINE BEECHAM AND AMERICAN OSTEOPATHIC ASSOCIATION 
TEAM UP FOR NATIONAL CALL-IN</H3>
<B>Physicians Will Offer Free Health Information During 
"DIAL-A-D.O." 1996</b>
</center>
<br><p>

(Chicago) -- Its a visit to the doctor -- minus the waiting room and cold stethoscope.  And for two days this fall, it will be as close as your nearest telephone.  The American Osteopathic Associations <B>Dial-A-D.O.</B> hotline, a national call-in sponsored by Smithkline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, will accept calls on <B>October 8 and 9, 1996 from 7:00am-7:00pm Pacific Standard Time.</B>  The toll-free number is <B>1-800-DOs-4895, or 1-800-367-4895.</B><p>

More than 120 osteopathic physicians (D.O.s) will answer calls during the two-day program, fielding callers questions about general health and osteopathic medicine.  <B>Physicians will not diagnose by phone.</B>  If callers cannot reach a physician, they may leave a message on an automated line requesting information by mail.<p>

<B>"Dial-A-D.O."</B> supports the osteopathic medical professions interest in prevention and wellness, and reflects the osteopathic commitment to primary care. The program is also an opportunity for people nationwide to take a first step toward their good health and that of their family.<p>

"There is an element of security in visiting a physician by phone--once we remove the threat of poking, prodding and needles normally associated with an office visit, patients can get down to the business of seeking answers to their pressing health questions.  And D.O. participants, minus tests and cumbersome medical reports, can get down to the business of answering them.  Ultimately, Dial-A-D.O. is a mutually beneficial program with a tremendous capacity to reach several thousand people, and its a logical extension of our commitment to medicine, explained Howard L. Neer, D.O., President of the American Osteopathic Association.<p>

"Dial-A-D.O." is being held in conjunction with the American Osteopathic Association's 101st annual Convention and Scientific Seminar, October 10-14, 1996, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  More than 7,000 D.O.s and others related to the profession are scheduled to attend the meeting, which will feature educational sessions as well as exhibits.<p>

SmithKline Beecham is sponsoring "Dial-A-D.O." as part of <B>Osteopathic Medicine's Caring Cooperative,</B> a patient education collaboration with the American Osteopathic Association.<p>

Across the nation, the AOA, representing nearly 38,000 osteopathic physicians, promotes the public health, encourages scientific research, and is the accrediting agency for osteopathic schools and hospitals.<p>

<h2>Creating a Safer Work Environment</h2>

<b>
When you hear the words "occupational injury," you might think of factory workers or
farmers who spend their days working with dangerous machinery.  But a far greater 
number of workplace injuries in the United States happen to people who work in offices.  Job-related injuries that cause the most lost work days are known as repetitive motion injuries.<p>

<center>
<table width=95%><tr><td><img src="19hh.jpg"></td><td><b>
As the name implies, repetitive motion injuries develop when you make the same
movement over and over again, whether it's typing, putting something together on an
assembly line, or even working a computer mouse.  According to the federal bureau
of labor statistics, about a million people are forced to take time off of their jobs
because of repetitive motion injuries every year, most of whom are office workers.<p>

Robert Danoff, DO, MS, the Director of the family practice residency program at
the Delaware Valley Medical Center in Pennsylvania says, "When you sit down at a
computer, make sure your spine is against the back of your chair.  Your shoulders should be relaxed and your desktop should be at the same height as your elbows, so that your forearms are parallel to the floor, not bent up or down to reach the keyboard."  He also suggests using a wrist wrest so your wrists are even with the keyboard, and adjusting your chair so that your knees are even with or higher than your hips.  "It's also important to take frequent breaks so that you can briefly stand up and stretch," says Dr. Danoff.  Following these steps should help keep you healthier and more productive on the job.<p>

<h2>What Should You Look For<br>When Choosing Breakfast Cereals?</h2>
</center>

<b>It's amazing how many cereals there are to choose from in the supermarket.
It's also amazing how much some cereal brands cost.  At up to four dollars
a pound, it makes sense to select one that is good for you.  Here are
some suggestions from Richard K. Pace, DO, an osteopathic family physician in Lake Worth, Florida.<p>

Choose a cereal made from whole grains, which contribute fiber to
your diet.  Studies suggest eating twenty to thirty grams of fiber per
day to lower your risk of cancer and keep your digestive system working
properly.  You can also find fiber in fruits, vegetables, and whole grain
bread.  Cereals list fiber content on the side of the box. Choose one
with two or more grams per serving.<p>

Find a cereal low in sugar.  Sugar is fattening and can harm your
teeth.  Additionally, more sugar leaves less room for nutritional
ingredients.  Select a cereal with no more than five grams of sugar.  It
may surprise you that some cereals have a lot of hidden salt.  Two cups
of some cereals may contain up to seven hundred milligrams of sodium.  If
you are on a low-salt diet, make sure you select a low-sodium cereal.<p>

Finally, check the fat content.  Although most types are low in fat, some -
 such as granola and muesli - can be loaded.  Whatever cereal you select, you can make it healthier by using skim or low fat milk rather than cream or whole milk, and adding fresh fruit and a couple of slices of whole grain bread or toast.<p>

<h2>Your Back and Your Mattress</h2>
<b>
If your mattresses getting a bit lumpy, one way to prolong its life a little bit is to turn it over.  In fact, it's not a bad idea to turn your mattress every six months or so.<p>

<img src="20hh.jpg" align=right>
If your mattress is too soft, but is in good condition otherwise, you might be
able to save the cost of a new mattress by placing a board under your old one.  Put the board between the springs and the mattress.  On the other hand, if your mattress is too firm, you can make it more comfortable by covering it with a foam mattress topper.<p>

If you are troubled by morning backaches, you might consider getting a waterbed or an air bed. They avoid creating "high pressure" points on the shoulders and hips by allowing you to literally float on the water or air.  That's especially
helpful for people who sleep on their side or who have shoulder problems.  When you
wake up sore or stiff, Frank Myers, DO, an osteopathic family physician in Athens, OH, recommends doing some gentle morning exercises.  That may relieve the discomfort.  If the pain won't go away, or persists no matter what kind of mattress you sleep on, see your family doctor.<p>

<h2>The Dangers of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning</h2>
<b>
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that can kill you if you breathe too much of it.  About a thousand Americans a year die from accidental carbon monoxide
inhalation, and ten times as many are treated for exposure to the deadly gas.<p>

Many common household appliances such as faulty gas ranges, kerosene space heaters, clothes dryers, hot water heaters, fire	places, and wood stoves can emit carbon monoxide.  Carbon monoxide is also a component of automobile exhaust and
cigarette smoke.<p>

According to Katherine A. Martin, DO, an osteopathic family physician in San
Diego, California, "It is essential to have your appliances inspected regularly for 
leaks and other malfunctions that could allow carbon monoxide to escape.  It's also a
great idea to get a carbon monoxide detector." The detectors look similar to smoke
detectors and sound an alarm if they detect hazardous levels of the gas.  They are
either battery powered or plug into a wall and cost between $35 and $80.  They can 
be found in most hardware stores.<p>

Early symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may be easily confused with the flu.
They include headaches, dizziness, nausea, and	fatigue.  Continued exposure can cause vomiting, confusion, heart problems, coma, and death.  Exposure to small concentrations for a long period of time can be nearly as dangerous as exposure to a large amount of carbon monoxide all at once.  If you do feel any symptoms, get fresh air and medical help right away.<p>

<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>

As of 1994, 51% of insured Americans (92 million of 181 million,
including dependents) received health care through managed care 
organizations.&#185;  Enrollment increased 14-fold from 1989 to 
1994.&#178;  It has been estimated that by 1997, 85% of the
population will be covered by managed care.  Because of this 
explosive growth, it is vital that osteopathic physicians be
proactive with regard to participation in managed care organizations.<p>

Primary care physicians play a critical role in the delivery of
managed health care and the demand for this key player is rapidly
increasing.  Colleges of osteopathic medicine have a strong
tradition of graduating a large percentage of primary care 
physicians -- far more than their allopathic counterparts.  In
1992, only 14% of allopathic medical school graduates chose a
primary care career compared with a consistent rate of about 40%
of osteopathic medical school graduates.&#178;  This creates an
outstanding opportunity for osteopathic physicians to fill a need
and become leaders in this rapidly evolving health care
delivery system.<p>

As leaders in the field, osteopathic physicians will have an
opportunity to impact the design of the system ensuring that 
managed care organizations deliver cost-effective care without
sacrificing quality.  To communicate the high standards of
osteopathic medicine effectively within these organizations,
osteopathic physicians must learn to speak their language.
This page will help you begin that process -- a first step
toward becoming a manager of managed care.<p>

<center>
<table width = 85%><tr><td><b>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Health maintenance 
organization (HMO).</font><p>
Provides coverage of agreed-on health services needed by plan 
members for a fixed, prepaid premium. There are four basic models
of HMOs: group model, individual practice association, network model
and staff model.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Group model HMO.</font><p>
Involves contracts with physicians organized in groups who receive 
a fixed payment per patient to provide specific services.  These
physicians usually see only HMO patients.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Individual practice association (IPA) 
model HMO.</font><p>
Involves contracts with independent physicians who work in their 
own private practices and see fee-for-service patients as well as 
HMO enrollees.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Network Model HMO.</font><p>
Involves contracts with multiple physician groups and sometimes with 
multiple specialties. Physicians work in their own offices and may 
also treat fee-for-service patients.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Staff model HMO.</font><p>
Employs physicians to provide health care to its members. The HMO
compensates physicians with salary and incentive programs.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Preferred provider organization 
(PPO).</font><p>
Contracts are established with care-givers referred to as 
preferred providers.  Usually, the benefit contract requires 
significantly less copayment for services received from preferred 
providers to motivate enrollees to use these providers.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Exclusive provider organization 
(EPO).</font><p>
Similar to a preferred provider organization (PPO); however, while 
a PPO provides coverage for non-preferred provider services as well 
as preferred provider services, an EPO only reimburses for services 
rendered by a preferred provider.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Point-of-service (POS) plan.</font><p>
Allows the covered person to decide at the time services are needed 
whether to choose a participating or non-participating provider with 
different benefit levels associated with the use of participating
providers.  There are several ways in which this plan may be delivered:
<UL>
<LI>an HMO may permit limited services from non-participating
providers
<LI>an HMO may offer a supplemental major medical policy to
provide non-participating benefits
<LI>a preferred provider organization (PPO) may be used to provide
both participating and non-participating coverage
<LI>various combinations of the above

An agreement between the Health Care Financing Administration and
a managed care plan requiring the plan to supply all Medicare-covered
services to Medicare-eligible enrollees at a predetermined monthly

regardless of their scope or cost.<p>

<font size=+1 color="#ff0000">Hold harmless clause.</font><p>
There are two types of hold harmless clause.  The first type involves
a physician's agreement not to pursue a patient for fees in excess of

<h2>Brief reports</h2>

<b>Management of patients with atypical squamous cells of
undetermined significance (ASCUS) on Papanicolaou smears<p>

RICHARD R. TERRY, DO<P></B>

To properly manage the patient who has an ASCUS Pap smear, it is
essential to consider the patient's Pap test history, risk factors
for cervical cancer, and the pathologist's 
interpretation / recommendation.  This article summarizes
management strategies.<p>

<hr>
<h2>Clinical practice</h2>

<b>Factitious disorders and the 'professional patient'<p>

COL. RAYMOND G. LANDE, MC, USA<p></b>

Factitious disorders are fabricated illnesses that conceptually

<h2>Dr Luibel honored for distinguished service</h2>
<Center>
<table width=80%><tr><td>


The AOA bestowed its highest honor on George J. Luibel, DO, during its 101st Annual Convention and Scientific Seminar, which was held Oct 7-11 in Las Vegas.
<p>
The AOA's 1976-77 president, Dr Luibel received the AOA's Distinguished Service Certificate in recognition of his outstanding service in osteopathic medical education and organization. Dr Luibel's wife, Mary, accepted the certificate on her husband's behalf during the AOA convention's opening session.
<p>
 A 1936 graduate of the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine, Dr Luibel has served as the president of the American Academy of Osteopathy (AAO), the Texas Osteopathic Medical Association (TOMA), the Tarrant County (Texas) Association of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons, and the Kirksville Osteopathic Alumni Association. He is a fellow of the AAO, and just five months ago, he received TOMA's Distinguished Service Award.
<p>
Dr Luibel was one of the three founders of what is today the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth--Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
<p>
In 1962, Dr Luibel chaired the committee that studied the feasibility of opening an osteopathic medical school in Fort Worth. After the state of Texas issued a charter for such a school in 1966, Dr Luibel became the first chairman of the school's board of directors. He served as the board's chairman until 1974, and in 1978, he was called upon to serve another year as the board's chairman.
<p>
The Texas college bestowed its highest honor, the Founders' Medal, on Dr Luibel in 1978, and 10 years later, the AOA and the National Osteopathic Foundation named Dr Luibel their Educator of the Year.
<p>
When Dr Luibel settled in Fort Worth in 1946, he joined the medical staff of the Fort Worth Osteopathic Hospital, which was then located in a two-story house. Dr Luibel served as the president of the hospital for 20 years, and he helped to transform the hospital into the Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas, which is one of the state's largest AOA-accredited hospitals.
<p>
As a member and as the chairman of the board of managers of the Tarrant County Hospital District, Dr Luibel helped to direct major renovation and expansion of Tarrant County's public hospital, the John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth.
<p>
In nominating Dr Luibel for the AOA's Distinguished Service Certificate, TOMA told the AOA Board of Trustees, "George J. Luibel, DO, exemplifies the qualities everyone seeks in a physician. He has dedicated his professional and personal life to serving mankind. ... He draws upon all the facets of his life--medical, spiritual, professional, personal, political and civic--to enrich everything he touches."

<h2>Osteopathic medical textbook debuts at AOA convention</h2>
<Center>
<table width=80%><tr><td>


The AOA's <I>Foundations for Osteopathic Medicine</I> textbook was unveiled at the 101st Annual AOA Convention and Scientific Seminar, which was held Oct 7-11 in Las Vegas.
<p>
The textbook, which is being published by Williams & Wilkins, is sponsored by the AOA Bureau of Research. <I>Foundations</I>  is intended to be used by first- and second-year osteopathic medical students, as well as by practicing osteopathic physicians.
<p>
"The textbook is designed to make osteopathic medical students understand the rationale behind osteopathic principles and practice and to help them understand what types of osteopathic manipulative treatment to use in different situations," explains Howard M. Levine, DO, the AOA's president-elect and the immediate past chairman of the AOA Bureau of Research. "The most important thing that the book will do is to help our students to 'think osteopathically.' If we can get our students to do that, we will create a renaissance in OMT that will ensure our future and preserve our distinctiveness."
<p>
At the AOA convention, all of the copies of the textbook that Williams & Wilkins had at its exhibit booths were sold, and numerous orders were placed for more copies.
<p>
<I>Foundations</I>, which consists of 1,000 pages and 750 illustrations, is divided into 11 chapters. The chapter headings are:
<UL>
<LI> "Osteopathic Philosophy."
<LI> "Osteopathic History."
<LI> "Osteopathic Considerations in the Basic Sciences."
<LI> "Osteopathic Considerations in the Behavioral Sciences."
<LI> "Osteopathic Considerations in Clinical Problem Solving."
<LI> "Osteopathic Considerations in Family Practice and Primary Care."
<LI> "Osteopathic Considerations in the Clinical Specialties."
<LI> "Osteopathic Considerations in Palpatory Diagnosis and Manipulative Treatment."
<LI> "Osteopathic Considerations in Health Restoration."
<LI> "Applications of Basic and Clinical Research for Osteopathic Theory and Practice."
<LI> "Glossary of Osteopathic Terminology."
</UL>

The book's executive editor is Robert C. Ward, DO, a professor of osteopathic manipulative medicine and family medicine at the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine in East Lansing and the director of the college's OMM residency programs.
<p>
Copies of the textbook cost $99 each. DOs and students can order copies by calling (800) 638-0672 or by writing to Williams & Wilkins, 351 W Camden St, Baltimore, MD 21201-2436. In addition, <I>Foundations</I>  is being sold in the bookstores of the nation's 17 osteopathic medical colleges.

<H2>Dr Sevastos installed as AOA president</H2>

<CENTER>
<table width=80%><tr><td>
<p>John P. Sevastos, DO, became the AOA's 99th president on July 21 during the inaugural luncheon that was held at the close of the annual meeting of the AOA House of Delegates in Nashville, Tenn. Earlier that day, Howard M. Levine, DO, was chosen by the House as the AOA's president-elect.

<p>Dr Sevastos, who practices family medicine and psychiatry in Cleveland, has been a member of the AOA Board of Trustees since 1982. He has served the AOA as the chairman of the Department of Public Affairs, the Department of Governmental Affairs, the Committee on Constitution and Bylaws, and the Osteopathic Progress Fund/Seals Committee.

<p>Dr Sevastos is a former president of the Ohio Osteopathic Association and the Cleveland Academy of Osteopathic Medicine, as well as a fellow and former president of the American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians (ACOFP). From 1978 to 1995, Dr Sevastos served as a regional assistant dean for the Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine in Athens.

<p>Dr Levine joined the AOA Board in 1983 as the association's 3rd vice president. Two years later, he was elected to a three-year term as an AOA trustee. Dr Levine has served the AOA as the chairman of the Department of Public Affairs, the Bureau of Research, the Bureau of Internal Affairs, and the Committee on Health Related Policies.

<p>A retired family physician from Bayonne, NJ, Dr Levine is a former president of the New Jersey Association of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons (NJAOPS), and he is a fellow of the ACOFP. Dr Levine was nominated for the office of president-elect by his son Martin S. Levine, DO, the NJAOPS's current president.

<p>All six of the AOA trustees whose terms expired this year were re-elected to three-year terms on the Board. They are S.L. Koplovitz, DO, of Harrisburg, Pa; Robert D. McCullough II, DO, of Tulsa, Okla; Capt Michael K. Murphy, DO, MC, USN, of Gaithersburg, Md; George Thomas, DO, of Euclid, Ohio; and James E. Zini, DO, of Mountain View, Ark.

<H3>Ethan R. Allen, DO, named NOF-AOA Educator of the Year</H3>
<center>
<table width=80%><tr><td>
<p>The National Osteopathic Foundation and the AOA have named Ethan R. Allen, DO, of Norwalk, Calif, as their 1996 Educator of the Year. Dr Allen accepted the award during a brief ceremony held July 19 at the annual meeting of the AOA House of Delegates in Nashville, Tenn.

<p>Dr Allen was nominated for Educator of the Year by Mitchell Kasovac, DO, a former AOA president and the dean of the Western University of Health Sciences College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific (COMP) in Pomona, Calif.

<p>Dr Allen served as the first chairman of COMP's board of directors from 1976 to 1978, and he is currently a member of Western University's board of directors.

</td></tr></table>

<table width=80%><tr><td>
<p>Since COMP opened in 1978, he has served the college as a lecturer and a preceptor. He also volunteers time on Saturdays to teach osteopathic manipulative treatment to COMP students.

<p>Donald J. Krpan, DO, Western University's provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, describes Dr Allen as "Mr Osteopathic Medicine in California."  "No one can walk in his shoes," says Dr Krpan, an AOA trustee.

<p>So as to surprise Dr Allen with the award, officials at Western University asked NOF not to inform Dr Allen in advance of the House meeting. Dr Allen's presence at the meeting was assured because Dr Allen is a delegate to the AOA House.

<p>Not only was Dr Allen taken by surprise by the announcement that he was the Educator of the Year, but the entire California delegation was able to leave their seats and form an escort before Dr Allen realized that anything unusual was happening.

<p>During the award ceremony, NOF Executive Director Michael A. Levin praised Dr Allen for playing an instrumental role in reopening California to DOs following the attempt in the early 1960s to merge the state's allopathic and osteopathic medical professions.

<p>Between 1968 and 1982, Dr Allen served three times as the president of the Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California (OPSC), which was established in response to the merger attempt. He was named the OPSC's Physician of the Year in 1983.

<p>Among his other accomplishments, Dr Allen established a drug abuse treatment coalition in Los Angeles with the help of his wife, Alice. Since 1972, Dr Allen has served as the president of the coalition, which is now known as the Los Angeles Centers for Alcohol and Drug Abuse.

<p>In accepting the Educator of the Year award, Dr Allen was quick to share credit for the profession's revival in California.

<p>"There were 400 other DOs who stood fast during those dark years from 1962 to 1974 and who helped to re-establish osteopathic medical licensure in California," said Dr Allen, a 1951 graduate of the College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons in Los Angeles, which became an allopathic institution during the merger attempt.

<p>NOF and the AOA established the Educator of the Year program in 1982. Recipients are nominated by the nation's osteopathic medical colleges on a rotating basis. The choices are approved by the AOA-NOF Osteopathic Progress Fund/Seals Committee.

<p>In the August issue of The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, Zane G. Craig, DO, and his colleagues examine the usefulness of serum estradiol in the differential diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. The authors report that measuring serum estradiol may be helpful in differentiating ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion from threatened abortion. However, the authors observe that serum estradiol testing is of limited value in distinguishing ectopic pregnancy from spontaneous abortion.

<p>In addition, the "Healthcare Policy" section in the August JAOA  will feature an article that outlines why osteopathic medical education is ideally suited to meet the demands of managed care.<p><br>

<H2>Dr Northup, former AOA editor and president, dies</H2>

George W. Northup, DO, the AOA's editor in chief from 1961 to 1987, died Dec 12, 1996, at the age of 81.

<p>
Dr Northup was the AOA's 1958-59 president, and he served as the AOA's editor emeritus for the past nine years.

<p>
A 1939 graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Dr Northup practiced family medicine in the New Jersey communities of Morristown, Madison and Livingston before moving to Arizona in 1972. He served as the director of medical education at Mesa (Ariz) General Hospital Medical Center from 1974 until 1992. Dr Northup, who lived in Scottsdale, Ariz, was retired at the time of his death.

<p>

<H2>Task force to prepare osteoporosis guidelines</H2>

<p>
A task force composed of seven osteopathic physicians is preparing clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with osteoporosis.

<p>
The task force is sponsored by the Center for Osteoporosis Prevention and Treatment at the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth--Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine (UNTHSC). The chairman of the task force is Bernard R. Rubin, DO, the center's director and the chief of rheumatology at UNTHSC.

<p>
The other members of the task force are Steve P. Buchanan, DO, the president of the American College of Osteopathic Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the director of the obstetrics and gynecology residency program UNTHSC; Bonnie Gardner, DO, an endocrinologist and a clinical assistant professor of medicine at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine; Mel E. Lucas, DO, a family physician from Florissant, Mo; Suzanne E. Norman, DO, MPH, a family physician from Cuba, NM; Judith Ann O'Connell, DO, a former president the American Academy of Osteopathy from Dayton, Ohio; and Gary J. Silverman, DO, a rheumatologist from Scottsdale, Ariz.

<p>
The task force's osteoporosis guidelines, which will be geared to primary care physicians, will be published later this year in <I>The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association</I>. The guidelines are expected to cover the following topics:

<UL>
<LI>The prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.
<LI>The use of osteopathic manipulative treatment in the care of patients with osteoporosis.
<LI>he use of biochemical markers in the management of patients with osteoporosis.
<LI>The role of managed care in the treatment of patients with osteoporosis.

</UL>

<p>
The guidelines also will include a series of profiles of typical osteoporosis cases.

<p>
The task force met for the first time at the 101st Annual AOA Convention and Scientific Seminar, which was held in Las Vegas in October 1996.

<H2>AOA staff writers win writing award</H2>

<p>
The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (AAAAM) awarded its 1996 Print Journalism Award to Robert Rakow Jr and Jeffrey Bouley.

<p>
Rakow and Bouley won the award for the series of cover articles on anti-aging medicine that they wrote for the June 1996 issue of <I>The DO</I>. Rakow has been with the <I>The DO</I>  since May 1995, and Bouley joined <I>The DO</I>  in March 1994.

AAAAM presented the award during its fourth annual Conference on Anti-Aging Medicine and Biomedical Technology, which was held Dec 14-16, 1996, in Las Vegas.

<p>
For copies of the award-winning articles, DOs and osteopathic medical students can call (312) 280-5866 or (800) 621-1773, Ext 5866, or they can write to Robert Rakow Jr, staff writer, the American Osteopathic Association, 142 E Ontario St, Chicago, IL 60611-2864.

<H2>Australian osteopath visits AOA, osteopathic medical colleges</H2>

<p>
An osteopath from Australia visited the AOA on Nov 8, 1996, as part of a month-long tour to learn how osteopathic medicine is practiced in the United States and the rest of the world.

<p>
Melanie Cameron, a staff member of the osteopathic medicine unit at the Victorian University of Technology in St Albans, Victoria, met with Michael L. Wallis, MPH, the AOA's manager for physician biographic records.

<p>
Also during the US portion of her tour, Cameron visited seven of the 17 AOA-accredited colleges of osteopathic medicine.

<p>
Even though osteopaths have practiced in Australia and New Zealand for more than 70 years, osteopathy is still a small profession in those countries. Only 600 osteopaths practice in Australia and New Zealand, says Cameron.

<p>
Australia has only two US-trained osteopathic physicians, and both of those are retired. Currently, New Zealand does not have any US-trained DOs.

<p>
Besides Victorian University, the only other institution in Australia that offers a training program in osteopathic manipulation is the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Victoria. Graduates of the five-year, full-time osteopathy programs at Victorian University and the Royal Melbourne Institute are awarded bachelor of clinical science degrees in osteopathic science.

<p>
The AOA is beginning to take a closer look at the international practice of osteopathic manipulation. In February 1996, for example, the AOA Board of Trustees decided to establish the AOA Committee on International Affairs. The committee is charged with drafting policies and procedures for responding to inquiries from foreign-trained osteopaths and government officials in foreign countries, as well as from US-trained DOs who are interested in practicing outside the United States.

<H2>January <I>JAOA</I> features study of transurethral microwave hyperthermia</H2>

<p>
The January issue of <I>The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association</I>  examines transurethral microwave hyperthermia (TMH), a relatively new treatment for patients with chronic nonbacterial prostatitis. Matthew P. Mene, DO, and his colleagues found that TMH reduces patients' symptoms with little associated morbidity.

<p>
In an accompanying editorial, David D. Wartinger, DO, and Lynne M. McCormick, DO, note that the value of TMH has been documented in other published studies and that the technique is far superior to transurethral resection of inflammed prostatic tissue.


<H2>Louisiana, Georgia associations name executive directors</H2>

<p>
The Louisiana Association of Osteopathic Physicians (LAOP) has named Lowell Dye, JD, to be its first executive director, and the Georgia Osteopathic Medical Association (GOMA) has named Kathy Yaeger as its new executive director.

<p>
Dye is the husband of Nancy A. Bellemare, DO, the LAOP's president. The LAOP's address is now 6 Spinnaker Lane, New Orleans, LA 70124-1651. The association's new telephone number is (504) 288-9572.

<h2>AOA, other osteopathic medical groups observe NOM Week</h2>
<Center>
<table width=80%><tr><td>


The AOA and other osteopathic medical organizations across the United States
celebrated National Osteopathic Medicine Week (NOM Week) on Nov 3-9.
<P>

For the second year, the theme of NOM Week was "Osteopathic Physicians: Shaping Up
America's Health." The continuing theme reflects NOM Week's collaboration with the
three-year "Shape Up America!" campaign of the C. Everett Koop Foundation.
<P>
<table border><tr><td>

As part of its celebration of NOM Week, the AOA offered free blood pressure
screenings to its employees and to the employees of the other osteopathic medical
organizations that are located in the AOA Chicago Office.

Association. (Photo by Robert Rakow Jr)
</td></tr></P></table>
<P>
Whereas last year's NOM Week focused on children's health, this year's campaign
targeted the health of the "sandwich generation." The sandwich generation consists
of adults who are raising children and caring for elderly parents. Members of this
generation rarely take time to care for their health. For example, many of them
neither exercise properly nor get routine health checkups.
<P>
To celebrate NOM Week, the AOA Department of Communications organized several
activities for its employees and for the employees of the other osteopathic medical
organizations that are located in the AOA Chicago Office. Among those activities
were free blood pressure screenings, a low-fat dessert competition, and a quiz
contest on NOM Week and osteopathic medicine.

Additionally, Richard A. Feely, DO, and Kenneth E. Nelson, DO, visited the AOA
Chicago Office to provide free osteopathic manipulative treatment. Both DOs
practice in Chicago, and both are fellows of the American Academy of Osteopathy.

</td></tr></P></table>
<p>
Other osteopathic medical organizations that celebrated NOM Week included the Ohio
University College of Osteopathic Medicine (OU-COM) in Athens. The highlight of
OU-COM's activities was a one-man show at the university's Visitors Center. Titled
<I>Osteopathic Heritage: A.T. Still Revisited,</I> the show featured actor Charles
Lewis as Andrew Taylor Still.
<P>
During the show, Lewis discussed the history of osteopathic medicine and the
evolution of healthcare since the US Civil War. Lewis also fielded questions from
the audience, and after the show, he toured OU-COM's facilities.
<P>
OU-COM's other NOM Week activities included a blood drive, a health fair, and a
health walk.
<P>
The Pinellas County (Fla) Osteopathic Medical Society (PCOMS) celebrated NOM Week
by collaborating with the <I>St Petersburg</I>  (Fla) <I>Times</I>  to publish a
special supplement on osteopathic medicine. The PCOMS supplied the articles for the
supplement, which ran Nov 1. The supplement reached 130,000 readers.
<P>
Doctors Hospital of Stark County, an AOA-accredited facility in Massillon, Ohio,
commemorated NOM Week by sponsoring several talks that were open to the public. The
talks covered health issues of importance to the sandwich generation.
<P>
The Arizona Osteopathic Medical Association conducted a focus group on long-term
care and assisted living.
<P>
And the Auxiliary to District IV of the Indiana Association of Osteopathic
Physicians and Surgeons provided $5 flu shots to the public and offered free health
screenings for vision, hearing and blood sugar. The auxiliary also sponsored a free
lecture on the healthcare needs of the sandwich generation.
<P>
In 1997, the last year of the "Shape Up America!" campaign, NOM Week will be held
Nov 2-8. The focus of the 1997 campaign will be the health of the elderly.

<p>
Established in 1891 and incorporated by the US Congress in 1903, AMSUS represents
health professionals in the US uniformed services. As the president of AMSUS, Dr
Blanck will be a voting member in the American Medical Association's 1997 House of
Delegates.
<P>
Also during AMSUS's meeting, Dr Blanck received the group's John D. Chase Award for
Physician Executive Excellence. Dr Blanck received the award for his
accomplishments in managing health services for the US Army Medical Department and
the US Department of Defense.
<P>
As the Army's surgeon general, Dr Blanck is ultimately responsible for the
healthcare provided to the Army's military personnel, civilian employees and
retirees, as well as their dependents. He oversees a budget of approximately $5
billion. And although his office is in Falls Church, Va, he is in direct command of
the US Army Medical Command, based at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. As the commander
of the Army Medical Command, Dr Blanck is in charge of more than 46,000 military
personnel and 26,000 civilian employees worldwide.
<P>
Dr Blanck is the first DO to serve as surgeon general of any of the US uniformed
services. As a lieutenant general, he is the highest ranking DO in the uniformed
services and the highest ranking physician in the Army.
<P>
For more information on Dr Blanck, refer to the November issue of <I>The DO</I>.

<h2>About the cover</h2>
Richard J. Van Buskirk, DO, PhD, demonstrates treatment of a right occipitaloid somatic dysfunction using a rediscovered articulatory technique of Andrew Taylor Still.  Beginning on page 598, Dr. Van Buskirk analyzes and presents techniques described at the turn of the century by Charles Hazzard, DO, a contemporary and student of Still.<br>

<h2>Original Contribution</h2>
<B>Hyperinsulinemia and coronary artery disease risk factors in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and nondiabetics<p>

ROBERT P. MOZERSKY, DO; VIJAY K. BAHL, MD; HITENDRA PATEL, MD;
SHARON PALUSHOCK, MD; HARUSIGH YAMAKAWA, MD;
PETER GRONDZIOWSKI, MD; WILLIAM MOOK, MS</b><p>

Hyperinsulinemia appears to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis in both the diabetic and nondiabetic populations.  Association was found
between high insulin levels and low levels of high-density lipoprotein and elevated levels of triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein.  Weight excess and hypertension were also associated with elevated levels of insulin.<p>

<hr>
<h2>Clinical Practice</h2>

<b>A manipulative technique of Andrew Taylor Still as reported by Charles Hazzard, DO, in 1905<p>

RICHARD L. VAN BUSKIRK, DO, PhD<P></B>

The author describes a newly rediscovered osteopathic manipulative treatment technique ascribed to Andrew Taylor Still, founder of osteopathic medicine.  The technique, as described, is essentially articulatory and involves use of axial compressive forces.<p>

<hr>
<h2>Case reports</h2>

<b>Partial central diabetes insipidus complicating nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma<p>

CAPT. DENNIS E. AMUNDSON, MC, USN; CDR JOHN C. OLSEN, MC, USN;
CDR DAVID S. WADE, MC, USN</b><p>

In light of the uncommon case they describe, the authors recommend that unrecognized diabetes insipidus be considered when traditional methods fail to correct fluid abnormalities in patients with nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma.<p>

<b>Treatment of onychomycosis and tinea pedis using itraconazole intermittent therapy<p>

JAMES Q. DEL ROSSO, DO<p></b>

The use of four "pulses" of itraconazole (400 mg/d for 1 week per month) was effective and well-tolerated in a 40-year-old woman and provided her with the first complete relief of the signs and symptoms of dermatophytosis that she had had in more than a decade.<p>

<b>Primary skeletal lymphoma imaging and pathologic correlation<p>

MICHAEL A. COOK, DO; ORLANDO l. MANFREDI, MD;
SARAH KASAW, MD; SEETHA MURUKUTLA, MD</b><p>

Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in the diagnosis and management of primary skeletal lymphoma, a rare tumor that has been traditionally imaged by plain-film radiography.  It defines the extent of tumor and the degree of soft tissue and bone marrow involvement as well as determining the biopsy site and monitoring response to treatment.<p>

<b>Metastatic Sertoli cell carcinoma of the testis<p>

MATTHEW P. MENE, DO, MSc; LEONARD K. FINKELSTEIN, DO, MSc;
SAMUEL J. MANFREY, DO, MSc; LAURENCE H. BELKOFF, DO, MSc</b><p>

Sertoli cell carcinoma of the testis, an extremely rare and deadly tumor, was diagnosed 2 years after the patient had undergone left orchiectomy.  Because of the impossibility of discriminating tumors that will have a malignant course from those with a benign course, close follow-up after orchiectomy in patients with Sertoli cell tumors is mandatory.<p>

<h1>The JAOA<br>
September, 1996</h1>
<img src="jcover.jpg">
</center>
<h2>About the cover</h2>
In an effort to increase the documentation of results from structural
examinations performed on patients being admitted to osteopathic
hospitals, Harry D. Friedman, DO, and colleagues developed an
educational program that included a standardized form for recording
these structural findings and diagnoses.  The results of their
educational intervention, which also included a videotape, are
reported in their article, beginning on page 529.<br>
<I>(Cover design by Michele T. Bojan)</I>

<h2>Original Contribution</h2>

<b>Standardization of the hospital record for osteopathic
structural examination:  Part 2. Effects of an educational
intervention on documentation of palpatory and structural
findings and diagnosis<p>

HARRY D. FRIEDMAN, DO; WILLIAM L. JOHNSTON, DO; ALBERT F. KELSO, PhD;
FREDERIC N. SCHWARTZ, DO; MYRON C. BEAL, DO; MICHAEL A. SEFFINGER, DO<p></b>

The authors developed a videotape and handout describing the use
of osteopathic structural diagnosis in the hospital setting, and 
gave this program to the incoming interns.  They then pulled
hospital admitting records after this program and compared them
with records predating the educational intervention.  They report 
the findings of their assessment of behavior in documenting
structural and palpatory findings in the hospital record.<p>

<hr>
<h2>Clinical Practice</h2>

<b>Practical guidelines for the treatment of heart failure:<br>
A commentary on the facts you need to know<p>

ROBERT J. STOMEL, DO, AND DAVID P. GOWMAN, DO<P></B>

An interpretation and summary of the Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research guidelines for the treatment of heart
failure, this article covers the salient points for
osteopathic primary care physicians.<p>

<hr>
<h2>Case reports</h2>

<b>Single photon emission computed tomography scanning
in diagnosis of a rare pelvic avulsion fracture<p>

MARK E. GITTINS, DO, AND WILLIAM D. KRAUSS, DO<p></b>

The clever use of an additional diagnostic technique -- SPECT 
scanning -- facilitated early detection of an infrequent, but
potentially long-term disabling, injury.  And, this early
diagnosis enabled appropriate treatment and the 12-year-old
patient's return to athletic participation.<p>


<b>Chest-wall metastasis after percutaneous fine-needle
aspiration biopsy<p>

RONALD F. SING, DO; PAUL T. KEFALIDES, BA; STEPHEN A. 
METTE, MD; MANOUCHER FALLAHNEJAD, MD<p></b>

The case described illustrates the potential for implantation
of malignant cells along the needle tract during fine-needle
aspiration biopsy (FNAB).  It also underscores the need to
define the individual indications for FNAB in the diagnostic
evaluation of lung masses.<p>

<h2>Republican adviser Rollins to open AOA convention</h2>
<Center>
<table width=80%><tr><td>
<p>Political strategist and author Ed Rollins will be the keynote speaker at 
the 101st Annual AOA Convention and Scientific Seminar. Rollins will speak 
during the convention's opening session, which will be held Tuesday, Oct 8, 
from 8 am to 9 am in the Conrad Room of the Las Vegas Hilton.

<p>During his 30-year career in politics, Rollins has helped numerous 
politicians to run for local, state and national offices. As the national 
director of Ronald Reagan's 1984 presidential campaign, Rollins helped Reagan 
to win re-election by the largest landslide in US history.

<p>In 1994, Rollins helped Republican George Nethercutt unseat Democrat 
Thomas S. Foley for Washington state's 5th US Congressional District. The 
victory marked the first time in history that a sitting speaker of the US 
House of Representatives was defeated.

<p>Rollins also served as the national chairman of Jack Kemp's unsuccessful 
campaign for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination. Additionally, 
Rollins held managerial positions in the presidential campaigns of Richard M. 
Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.

<p>From 1989 to 1990, Rollins served as the co-chairman of the National 
Republican Congressional Committee. He is the only person to have held 
that position who was not a member of Congress.

<p>Earlier this year, Rollins published his memoirs, <I>Bare Knuckles 
and Back Rooms</I>. In his book, Rollins recounts his many triumphs as 
well as his occasional blunders. He also provides candid portraits of 
Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan and George Bush, as well as H. Ross Perot, 
James A. Baker III and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.

<p>Rollins has been a commentator for CBS News, NBC News and the Cable 
News Network. In addition, he appears regularly on the television programs 
"Meet the Press," "Face the Nation," "This Week With David Brinkley," 
"Nightline," "Crossfire," "Larry King Live" and "CNN Newsmakers."

<p>DOs and osteopathic medical students who have yet to register for the 
AOA convention can still register on-site at the Las Vegas Convention Center.  
The convention starts Monday, Oct 7, and runs to Friday, Oct 11.

<p>DOs and students can obtain additional information about the convention 
by calling (800) 621-1773, Ext 5, or (312) 280-7433.

<h3>Caring Cooperative's promotion kit to debut at AOA convention</h3>
<center>
<table width=80%><tr><td>
To help DOs market their practices, The Osteopathic Medicine's Caring 
Cooperative(TM) has created Keep in Touch, a practice promotion kit.

<p>The Caring Cooperative, which is a joint venture between the AOA 
and SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, will unveil the kit at the 101st 
Annual AOA Convention and Scientific Seminar, which will be held Oct 7-11 
in Las Vegas.

<p>DOs will be able to obtain copies of the kit at the Caring Cooperative's 
section of SmithKline Beecham's exhibit booth. In addition, SmithKline 
Beecham sales representatives will begin distributing copies of the kit 
in October to osteopathic physicians in their territories.

<p>Keep in Touch contains the following items:
<ul>
<li>a set of health advice columns that DOs can personalize and 
submit to local newspapers.
<li>25 Health Notes, which are letters that DOs can use to educate 
and keep in touch with patients on a regular basis. Each letter 
addresses a different medical topic. The topics include Alzheimer's 
disease, diabetes, hypertension, menopause and prostate cancer. The 
letters are provided on a computer disk so that DOs can personalize 
them and print them out on their office stationery.
<li>two camera-ready advertisements of different sizes that can be 
customized with a DO's office address and telephone number and run 
in local newspapers.
<li>a brochure that provides tips on how DOs can market their practices.
</ul>

<p>The Caring Cooperative also is producing a series of patient 
education brochures.  The first three brochures in the series were 
distributed free to AOA members in August by SmithKline Beecham's 
sales representatives. In addition, those brochures will be available 
at SmithKline Beecham's booth at the AOA convention.

<p>The three brochures are titled "For Better Health: Make Fitness 
Your Lifelong Goal," "Living With High Blood Pressure: It's in Your 
Control," and "Keep Your Family Healthy: Get Vaccinated!"

<p>The Caring Cooperative plans to produce and distribute three 
more patient education brochures by the end of the year.

<p>DOs can purchase additional copies of the new patient education 
brochures by calling (800) 621-1773, Ext 7426, or (312) 280-7426, or 
they can write to the American Osteopathic Association, order department, 
142 E Ontario St, Chicago, IL 60611-2864.

<h3>DO volunteers needed to staff Dial-A-DO at AOA convention</h3>
<center>
<table width=80%><tr><td>
The AOA is looking for at least 120 DOs to field calls to a national 
toll-free health information hot line during the 101st Annual AOA 
Convention and Scientific Seminar in Las Vegas.

<p>Called Dial-A-DO, the hot line will be open Tuesday, Oct 8, and 
Wednesday, Oct 9, from 7 am to 7 pm Pacific Daylight Time. DOs who 
volunteer to staff the hot line are being asked to devote at least 
two hours to answer calls. All practicing osteopathic physicians, 
residents and interns are welcome to volunteer for the program.

<p>Ten telephone lines for Dial-A-DO will be set up in a section of 
Exhibit Halls N1 and N2 of the Las Vegas Convention Center. The 
telephone number for Dial-A-DO will be (800) 367-4895.

<p>The Dial-A-DO project is part of The Osteopathic Medicine's 
Caring Cooperative(TM), a joint venture between the AOA and 
SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. The Caring Cooperative is 
creating educational materials and programs tailored to four 
target audiences: the members of the osteopathic medical profession, 
the patients of osteopathic physicians, the public, and managed 
care entities.

<p>DOs who staff the Dial-A-DO lines will answer questions about 
general health and osteopathic medicine. Volunteers will not 
diagnose medical conditions over the phone.

<p>Callers who are unable to reach a DO will hear a recorded 
message about osteopathic medicine, and they will be invited 
to leave messages requesting that general information be mailed 
to them.

<p>The Dial-A-DO project debuted at the 1995 AOA convention in 
Orlando, Fla. Nearly 840 callers obtained advice from 50 volunteer 
osteopathic physicians on such medical topics as asthma, carpal 
tunnel syndrome, low back pain, osteoporosis, prostate cancer, 
smoking cessation and weight loss. Because of the volume of calls, 
163 other callers were diverted to a recorded message.

<p>Since April, news releases announcing the Dial-A-DO project have 
been sent to consumer and managed care magazines, major print media, 
and healthcare organizations. And news releases are being sent to 
major broadcast media in September.

<p>To volunteer to answer calls for Dial-A-DO during the AOA 
convention, call (800) 621-1773, Ext 7404, or (312) 280-7404 
by Tuesday, Oct 1.

<h3>National Osteopathic Medicine Week set for Nov 3-9</h3>
<center>
<table width=80%><tr><td>
This year, National Osteopathic Medicine Week (NOM Week) will be 
celebrated Nov 3-9.

<p>For the second year, the theme of NOM Week will be "Osteopathic 
Physicians: Shaping Up America's Health." The continuing theme 
reflects NOM Week's collaboration with the three-year Shape Up 
America campaign of C. Everett Koop, MD, the surgeon general of 
the US Public Health Service from 1981 to 1989.

<p>Whereas last year's NOM Week focused on children's health, 
this year's campaign will target the health of the "sandwich 
generation." The sandwich generation consists of adults who are 
raising children and caring for elderly parents. Members of this 
generation rarely take time to care for their health. For example, 
many of them neither exercise properly nor get routine health checkups.

<p>In 1997, the last year of the Shape Up America campaign, NOM 
Week will focus on the health of the elderly.

<p>In June, the AOA Department of Communications shipped NOM 
Week kits to numerous osteopathic medical organizations, 
including state and local osteopathic medical associations, 
osteopathic specialty societies, the American Osteopathic 
Healthcare Association, the Student Osteopathic Medical 
Association, the Council of Student Council Presidents, 
the National Osteopathic Foundation and other osteopathic 
medical foundations, and the Auxiliary to the AOA and its 
affiliates.

<p>The kit contains tools for conducting NOM Week campaigns, 
such as fact sheets on stress management, disease prevention, 
and diet and exercise; a sample news release; a sample public 
service announcement; a camera-ready NOM Week advertisement; 
and camera-ready NOM Week logos. The kit also contains a form 
for ordering NOM Week merchandise, such as pens, T-shirts and 
plastic drinking cups.

<p>The 1996 NOM Week kit was designed to fit into the three-ring 
binders that the AOA distributed with last year's NOM Week kit. 
The 1997 NOM Week kit also will be designed to fit into the binders.

<h2>Dr Blanck named Army's surgeon general</h2>

<Center>
<table width=80%><tr><td>

<p>Ronald R. Blanck, DO, MC, USA, became the surgeon general of the US Army on Oct 1. On that same day, Dr Blanck was promoted from major general to lieutenant general.

<p>For the past four years, Dr Blanck served as the commander of Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC.

<p>Dr Blanck is the first DO to serve as surgeon general of any of the US commissioned services. As a lieutenant general, Dr Blanck is the highest ranking DO in the commissioned services. He is also the highest ranking physician in the Army.

<h2>Legislation recognizes AOA board certification under Medicaid</h2>
<Center>
<table width=80%><tr><td>
<p>The US Congress unanimously passed legislation in late September to correct Section 4752 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), which inadvertently overlooked AOA board certification in family medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics.

<p>"This victory is unprecedented. This legislation is dedicated solely to advancing the interests of the osteopathic medical profession," observes Marcelino Oliva, DO, the chairman of the AOA Council on Federal Health Programs.
	
<p>The AOA struggled for four years to persuade Congress to pass legislation to correct the oversight in OBRA '90. However, earlier bills failed because they became tangled in issues unrelated to the recognition of AOA board certification under Medicaid.
	
<p>Section 4752 of OBRA '90 requires that a physician meet at least one of six criteria to receive reimbursement for services to Medicaid beneficiaries who are younger than 21 or who are pregnant. The AOA objected to the first of those six criteria, which specifies that a physician be certified in family medicine, pediatrics or obstetrics by a certifying board recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties.
	
<p>By passing the Medicaid Osteopathic Certification Act of 1996 last month, Congress modified the criteria established in OBRA '90 to include AOA board certification in family medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics.
	
<p>The House of Representatives passed the bill on Sept 24, and the Senate passed it three days later. President Bill Clinton is expected to sign the bill into law in early October.
	
<p>"This legislation will make it possible for [DOs] to be reimbursed [by Medicaid] when they are caring for a pregnant woman or a child under the age of 21. This legislation is long overdue," US Rep Joe L. Barton, R-Texas, said during the House debate on the bill. Barton introduced the bill in the House last year, and he helped to garner the bill's 60 co-sponsors.
	
<p>"During the past three years, DOs, osteopathic medical students, and the executive directors of state osteopathic medical associations have repeatedly contacted their representatives in Congress to urge them to correct the OBRA '90 oversight," says Dr Oliva. "This grassroots effort gave the AOA's legislative initiative the personal impact and the credibility it needed to advance."
	
<p>The final push to pass the bill began Sept 13, when staff members from the AOA Washington Office urged members of the House Commerce Committee to review the bill along with the other Medicaid technical corrections bills that the committee was considering. Although the committee's schedule was full, the committee members agreed to review the bill.
	
<p>US Rep Thomas J. Bliley Jr, R-Va, the committee's chairman; US Rep John Dingell, D-Mich, the committee's ranking Democrat; and US Rep Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla, the chairman of the committee's Subcommittee on Health and Environment, supported the bill's passage out of committee.
	
<p>When the bill reached the House floor on Sept 19, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga, House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo, and House Minority Whip David E. Bonior, D-Mich, were instrumental in getting the bill placed on the House's calendar and in getting the bill passed.
	
<p>"Nowhere do osteopathic physicians represent a bigger or more vital part of the healthcare community than in my state, Michigan," Bonior said on the House floor. "In fact, while osteopathic physicians comprise only about 6% of all doctors nationwide, 25% of the physicians ... in Michigan are DOs. ... Excluding 25% of Michigan's doctors from the Medicaid program would have a terrible impact on the poorest and most vulnerable people in my state."
	
<p>When the bill reached the Senate on Sept 24, it was sent to the Senate Finance Committee. The bill was passed out of that committee with the help of the committee's chairman, US Sen William V. Roth Jr, R-Del; the committee's ranking Democrat, US Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-NY; and committee member US Sen John H. Chafee, R-RI, who had previously introduced similar legislation to correct the OBRA '90 omission.
	
<p>Once the bill reached the Senate floor, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, Senate Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles, R-Okla, and Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle, D-SD, provided crucial support for the bill's passage.

<h2>October <I>JAOA</I>  looks at early OMT technique</h2>
<Center>
<table width=80%><tr><td>
<p>In the October issue of <I>The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association</I>, Richard L. Van Buskirk, DO, PhD, describes an essentially articulatory osteopathic manipulative treatment technique that was ascribed to Andrew Taylor Still in 1905 by the late Charles Hazzard, DO.

<p>In the October issue's original contribution, Robert P. Mozersky, DO, and his colleagues explore the relationship between hyperinsulinemia and the known risk factors for coronary artery disease. The researchers studied subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, as well as nondiabetic subjects.

<B> Battling for DOs. </b> In the past 100 years, the AOA has helped DOs to obtain full practice rights in many states and to gain admission into the uniformed services. It became the accrediting body for osteopathic medical schools and hospitals. It has represented DOs who have been discriminated against by hospitals and third-party payers. And its has championed the profession's causes at the federal and state levels of government. <p>

<H3>LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE</H3><br>
<B>Advantages, disadvantages outlined at AOA conference. </b> The osteopathic medical profession's small size and its community-based education programs give it an edge in meeting the healthcare demands of the 21st century, observes Robert Graham, MD. <p>

<B>Macy conferences explore future of osteopathic medicine. </b>To produce physicians who can practice effectively in the evolving healthcare environment, significant changes must occur in medical education, says Douglas L. Wood, DO, PhD. <p>

<B>Frontiers endless in research, but resources limited. </b> If the osteopathic medical profession is to advance its agenda for clinical research, it must overcome problems with infrastructure, funding and priorities, notes Felix J. Rogers, DO. <p>

<B>Specialty colleges can apply OPP in research. </b> Through its Louisa Burns Osteopathic Research Committee, the American Academy of Osteopathy is helping to demonstrate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of osteopathic principles and practice, says Sandra L. Sleszynski, DO. <p>

<H2>AOA embarks on three initiatives for graduate medical education</h2>
</center>
<p>


The AOA has embarked on three initiatives to address graduate medical education (GME) 
financing and resulting physician workforce issues.
<p>
Because the federal government is trying to curb healthcare expenditures, it comes as 
no surprise that GME monies are in jeopardy. The AOA is working to ensure that quality, 
cost-effective healthcare is available to all people by promoting the value of 
osteopathic medical education and training programs to key policymakers. In addition, 
the AOA is working to assist policymakers in developing appropriate national physician 
workforce and training policies.

</td></tr></table>
</center>
<p>

<img src="opipari.gif" align=right>


To this end, the AOA will testify before the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC) 
in mid-December on the value of medical education and training consortia, such as the 
Osteopathic Postdoctoral Training Institutions (OPTIs). Michael Opipari, DO, chairman of 
the AOA's Council on Postdoctoral Training, will testify on the AOA's behalf in an 
attempt to gain the PPRC's support for the consortia concept as illustrated by the OPTI 
program. Such support would be extremely helpful when the AOA promotes the OPTI concept 
to Congress next year.
<p>


Second, the AOA is participating in a profession-wide task force on osteopathic GME.  As 
reported in the October issue of Government News Line, the AOA Board of Trustees at its 
October meeting approved a resolution submitted by the AOA Council on Federal Health 
Programs that called for the establishment of an Osteopathic GME Task Force with 
representatives from the AOA, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic 
Medicine (AACOM) and the American Osteopathic Healthcare Association. The purpose of 
this task force is to develop policy, respond to reform proposals, and act as a resource 
for staff as they respond to proposals from legislators and academia. The first meeting 
of the task force is scheduled to occur sometime in January via conference call.
<p>

Third, the AOA is engaged in dialogue with representatives of the American Medical 
Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, AACOM, the Association of 
Academic Health Centers and the National Medical Association to develop consensus on 
general medical education and training policy. If the "House of Medicine" can reach 
consensus on this issue,  the AOA's job on Capitol Hill next year will be much easier. A 
draft consensus document will be the basis of a public forum in early December, during 
which medical associations will testify in support of, or against, the principles of 
reform included in the document. After the public forum, the aforementioned groups will 
determine if consensus among the members of the "House of Medicine" exists. If consensus 
does exist, a press conference will be held sometime during the beginning of the 105th 
Congress to promote the reform plan. 
<p>

All of these three initiatives will lay a strong foundation of advocacy for the 
osteopathic medical education continuum in the 105th Congress.

<h2>From our chairmen:</h2>

<p><img src="thomas.gif" align=right>


The issue of physicians administering treatment to patients suffering from intractable 
pain was a main topic of discussion at the October meeting of the Bureau of State 
Government Affairs. The treatment of patients with intractable pain, in particular, the 
treatment of individuals suffering from a terminal illness, has been a growing concern 
to the public and medical profession.  

<p>
At the meeting, the Bureau heard testimony from AOA Ethics Committee Chairman, Donald J. 
Krpan, DO, in support of state legislation to protect physicians from disciplinary 
actions for prescribing or administrating controlled substances to patients with 
intractable pain.  With the help of AOA state executive directors, the Bureau 
has identified ten states that are expected to take legislative action on this issue in 
1997.  The Bureau and the Ethics Committee have recently forwarded their findings on 
intractable pain to the AOA's Trustees with a recommendation that the AOA adopt an 
official policy in support of intractable pain legislation.

<p>
In addition, the Bureau voted to adopt the Agenda  '96 - '97 proposal as submitted to 
the Bureau at the October meeting. This document will be used as a guide for the 
Division of State Government Relations activities over the next 12 months. 
<p>
<hr width=33%>
<p><img src="oliva.gif" align=left>
Now that the 104th Congress and the 1996 presidential and congressional elections are 
behind us, the Council on Federal Health Programs is gearing up for its legislative 
efforts in the 105th Congress. 
<p>
As reported previously, the osteopathic medical profession had a major victory at the 
adjournment of the Congress with the passage of the Medicaid Osteopathic Certification 
Act of 1996, but the legislators fell short of enacting any broad healthcare reforms. 
The Kennedy/Kassebaum legislation provides a good framework for additional health 
insurance reforms, but there is no such framework in place for the healthcare financing 
and delivery reforms that are so necessary.
<p>
Since there will again be a Democratic administration working with a Republican- 
controlled Congress, I believe we will hear the same discussions and debates on 
healthcare issues such as oversight for managed care organizations, physician workforce 
policy, graduate medical education financing and  medical liability reform. As we saw in 
the 104th Congress, many of these debates ended up in partisan gridlock.  How then will 
we overcome such gridlock in the 105th session?  I believe that members of the medical 
profession, working together, can develop strong advocacy groups that can influence the 
Congress. Advocacy groups are already beginning to form that will act to protect the 
interests of the osteopathic medical profession and promote much-needed healthcare 
reforms. The Council on Federal Health Programs Agenda '97 will reflect this advocacy 
philosophy. I look forward to sharing the Agenda with all of you in late January after 
the Council's first meeting.

<h2>AAOE discusses status of NBOME</h2>
<I>by Robert W. Foster, DO, AAOE President</I>
<br><p>
The status of the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) exam was the 
main topic of discussion at the October meeting of the American Association of 
Osteopathic Examiners (AAOE) in Las Vegas. 

<p>
Representatives from at least 12 licensing boards attending the meeting, along with  
representatives from the American Osteopathic Association, the Bureau of State 
Government Affairs (BSGA), the NBOME and the American Association of Colleges of 
Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM). Gerald Osborn, DO, vice president of the NBOME, said they 
are currently introducing Step 2 of COMLEX, which replaces Part II of the NBOME exam. 
The NBOME is also in the process of developing an osteopathic version of the Federation 
of State Medical Board's (FSMB) Special Purpose Examination (SPEX). This new 
examination, which would include osteopathic principles and practices, would enable 
state licensing boards to adequately test the proficiency of osteopathic physicians who 
have been out of medical school for five or more years. 
<p>
The NBOME has also contacted the FSMB about appointing an FSMB representative to serve 
on the NBOME Liaison Committee. In addition, the NBOME is writing an article on COMLEX-
USA for the FSMB's Bulletin, which should be published in time for the FSMB's annual 
meeting in April.
<p>
Douglas L. Wood, DO, PhD, AACOM president, said that there was close to unanimous 
support among the colleges of osteopathic medicine to require the NBOME for graduation. 
Currently, 13 of the 16 colleges require students to sit for Part 1, nine colleges 
require students to sit for Part 2 or Step II (which implies the passage of Part 1), and 
four colleges require passage of Part 1 and either passage of Part 2 or Step II.  Dr. 
Wood noted that AACOM would like the COMLEX exam schedule to be reconsidered. The NBOME 
agreed to look at rescheduling exam dates if it would be helpful to the colleges. 
Attendees were also updated on the efforts of the AOA in securing recognition of the 
NBOME in Louisiana, licensing changes in Texas and the new Federation Credential 
Verification Service (see story on page 5).
<p>
Linda Mascheri, assistant director of AOA State Government Relations, researched state 
medical practice acts to ascertain which states have acts that contain appropriate 
language with regard to the osteopathic medical profession. She then compiled a handout 
on acceptable medical practice language for osteopathic medical education, GME, 
examination sequence, specialty board certification and CME.  This information will give 
the AAOE a starting point for developing "model osteopathic language" for inclusion in 
state medical practice acts.  
<p>
Dates for the AAOE's 1997 Summit meeting will be discussed at the next AAOE meeting, 
which will be held in conjunction with the FSMB's  annual meeting in San Diego. The 
tentative date for the AAOE meeting is Wednesday, April 16. An announcement of the time 
and location of the meeting will be mailed to all AAOE members prior to the FSMB 
meeting.  Anticipated topics for the AAOE meeting include the candidates who are 
nominated for FSMB offices, the development of strategies to help promote osteopathic 
representation within the FSMB and planning for the 1997 Summit meeting.  
<p>
Bill McCord, DO, an FSMB board member who sits on the Tennessee Board of Osteopathic 
Examiners, will be running for re-election to the FSMB board for a three-year term and 
needs the support of DOs at the upcoming FSMB meeting.  Dr. McCord has also been 
appointed to fill a newly created position on the AOA's Bureau of State Government 
Affairs, in which he represents the AAOE as a voting member. This appointment 
demonstrates the AOA's support for the involvement of the AAOE in state government 
affairs.
<p>
Anyone interested in running for an FSMB office or serving on an FSMB committee should 
contact Linda Mascheri at (800) 621-1773,  ext. 3652, or Robert Foster, DO, AAOE 
president, at (304) 647-6290.

<h2>FCC committee addresses telemedicine needs of rural health facilities</h2>
<p>
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Telecommunications and Health Care Advisory 
Committee made public in November their recommendations to the FCC concerning the rural 
telemedicine provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other telemedicine 
issues.
<p>
The recommendations, which focused  primarily on the communication needs of providers in 
rural areas, include the following: that rural health facilities be given the financial 
support to develop an adequate infrastructure to implement telemedicine, that standards 
be established to ensure interoperability among networks with different technologies and 
equipment and that access to the Internet be made available at the same cost as in urban 
areas. The Committee stated that both the federal government and the states should 
assist in funding  infrastructure development and subsidizing cost differentials between 
rural and urban markets for access to telecommunications providers.
<p>
The Committee also touched upon telemedicine in the international arena.  Members of the 
committee identified many of the barriers to international telemedicine implementation, 
including access at a reasonable rate, availability of capital, varying licensure 
requirements, incompatibility of systems, and scarcity of healthcare professionals 
abroad, but did not make any recommendations  on how to address these barriers. The 
Committee, however, did recommend the establishment of a working group composed of 
representatives from federal agencies and the private sector to help promote 
telemedicine abroad.
<p>
If you would like additional information or have questions concerning telemedicine, 
please call Keith Brin, legislative analyst, AOA State Government Relations, at (312) 
280-3653 or (800) 621-1773, ext. 3653.

<h2>DOs are lowest-cost providers in Colorado</h2>
<p>
A recent study conducted by the actuarial firm Milliman & Robertson in Colorado shows 
that DOs are the lowest cost providers of workers' comp healthcare services in the state 
among chiropractors, MDs, mental health providers and physical therapists as a function 
of average cost per claim. The study was commissioned by the Colorado Division of 
Insurance for claims closed in 1995. This is the fifth consecutive year the study has 
been conducted.

<h2>Two major HMOs remove gag clauses from contracts</h2>
<p>

Humana Inc., based in Louisville, Ky., recently decided to remove language from its 
contracts with 40,000 physicians nationwide that physicians say prevented them from 
discussing all available treatment options with patients. United Healthcare Corp., based 
in Minneapolis, is also removing so-called "gag-clauses" from their provider contracts 
and says it is adding contract language that will encourage physicians to discuss all 
treatment options with patients, even those treatments that are not covered as a 
benefit.
<p>
The American Association of Health Plans (AAHP), a Washington association representing 
HMOs, expects other HMOs to follow suit. "We expect that other HMO plans will move in a 
similar direction as Humana," says Donald White, an AAHP spokesperson. Sixteen states 
have passed legislation banning gag clauses, and 14 states plan to introduce 
similar measures.

<p>
 The Federation Credentials Verification Service (FCVS) will contract with individual 
licensing boards (allopathic or osteopathic) to verify the core credential documents  
necessary for physician licensure, which include physician biographical information, 
medical education, including medical school transcripts, graduate medical education and 
verification of the physician examination sequence. The core credential information will 
be used by state medical boards to assist in evaluating physicians for initial 
licensure, reactivation/reinstatement of licensure or licensure by endorsement. 
Physicians must provide their written consent to obtain documents from the FCVS and must 
pay an initial fee to initiate the core credentialing process (see box).  Subsequent  
credentialing requests will be processed at a substantially reduced rate.  
<p>
Although the AOA believes that the FCVS  provides a worthwhile service, the AOA does not 
endorse the use of the FCVS as a requirement for physicians who wish  to petition for 
licensure.  The AOA endorses the use of the FCVS as an option for credential 
verification.
<p>
The state licensing boards of Utah, Ohio and Wyoming have already signed contracts with 
the FCVS as part of an FCVS pilot program, and Georgia, Maryland and Virginia are 
expected to sign up for  the credentialing service by the end of the year. Fourteen 
other state boards have agreed to accept FCVS-verified documents, but will not require 
them for physician licensure. At the request of the AOA, the Utah Osteo-pathic Board of 
Medical Examiners has agreed to make the use of the FCVS an option as opposed to a 
requirement for licensure. The state's allopathic board, however, will require MDs to 
use the FCVS.
<p>
The State Medical Board of Ohio has published a proposed amendment stating that all 
physicians applying for a Ohio license be required to use the FCVS.  The AOA wrote a 
letter to the board  stating that physicians petitioning for a license in Ohio should 
have a choice to use or not use the FCVS. The Ohio licensing board subsequently 
scheduled a hearing for Nov. 14. The AOA also contacted the Wyoming Board of Medicine, 
which has not signed up with the credentialing service and has yet to indicate whether 
they will require physicians in the state to use the FCVS.
<p>
The AOA will continue to monitor the progress of the FCVS.  If you would like additional 
information, please contact Linda Mascheri, assistant director, AOA State Government 
Relations, at (800) 621-1773, ext. 3652.

<h2>Louisiana Medical Society calls for action by LBME</h2>
<p>

In response to the Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners' (LBME) refusal to accept the 
National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiner's (NBOME) exam as a pathway for the 
licensure of DOs in the state, the Louisiana Medical Society's House of Delegates is 
calling for the LBME to  review the NBOME exam.
<p>
At the Louisiana Medical Society's recent House of Delegates meeting in Shreveport, a 
representative of the LBME presented arguments as to why it is holding firm in 
supporting the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) as the only pathway 
for licensure in the state. The representative also chastised the medical society's 
board of governors for supporting the NBOME and challenged the society to put the issue 
to a vote of their House of Delegates. Louisiana Osteopathic Medical Association 
President Nancy Bellemare, DO, corrected several misstatements made by the 
representative about the NBOME and, in particular, challenged the LBME to substantiate 
its charges regarding DO pass/fail rates on the USMLE. The Louisiana Medical Society 
then called for a vote by their House of Delegates on their Board of Governors' 
recommendation that the state licensing board review the NBOME exam to determine its 
validity as a tool for measuring the medical competence of osteopathic physiciansa 
review the LBME has refused to undertake. The House of Delegates voted unanimously to 
accept the recommendation.
<p>
The House and Senate Health Committees of the state legislature scheduled a joint 
hearing for Nov. 12 to discuss the licensing issue. The AOA will testify that the LBME 
is not operating in the best interests of the citizens of Louisiana and will ask the 
committee to instruct the LBME to accept the NBOME without further delay.

<h2>AOA secures inclusion of osteopathic language in managed care legislation</h2>
<p>

The AOA has secured the inclusion of osteopathic-specific language in recent legislation 
aimed at protecting providers and patients in managed care plans.
<p>
Two weeks before the 104th Congress adjourned, a senior member of the House Ways and 
Means Subcommittee on Health, Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.),  introduced a revised version 
of The Managed Care Consumer Protection Act of 1996 (H.R. 4220) that contains  much of  
the osteopathic language the AOA had desired. The proposed legislation addresses 
provider contracting, utilization review standards and other managed care issues and 
calls for a ban on gag clauses in physician contracts along with proper access to 
emergency medical care, both of which the AOA strongly supports. 
<p>
After thoroughly reviewing the original version of the legislation, which  was 
applicable only to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans, AOA staff met 
with Rep. Stark's chief healthcare advisors to begin a discussion over how the bill 
could be improved. The AOA then seized the opportunity to advocate  the inclusion of 
osteopathic-specific language in the bill. Following weeks of negotiations with Rep. 
Stark's personal and committee staff, the congressman included most of the language 
drafted by AOA staff in the revised version of the bill.  The scope of the bill was also 
expanded to include all persons enrolled in managed care plans.  
<p>
Although the bill did not see action prior to Congress's adjournment, Rep. Stark has 
indicated that he will re-introduce it shortly after the 105th Congress convenes in 
January. The AOA will be working closely with Rep. Stark in the next Congress in an 
effort to put additional osteopathic-specific language into the bill that would prohibit 
a health plan from denying participation privileges to DOs solely on the basis of 
osteopathic training or certification. 	
<p>
The osteopathic-specific provisions currently included in the bill are as follows:
<p>
<center>
<table width=75%><tr><td>
<b>Utilization review</b><p>
" ...  with respect to a decision to deny the provision of medical items, services, or 
procedures, a provider licensed in the same field shall conduct a subsequent review to 
determine the medical appropriateness of such a denial and physicians from the same 
medical branch <b>(allopathic or osteopathic medicine) and specialty (recognized by the 
American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association) shall be 
utilized as needed."</b>
<p>
<hr width=50%><br>

<b>Due process protections for providers</b><p>
"Each plan or issuer shall provide a process under which a provider may request a review 
of the plan's or issuer's decision to terminate or refuse to renew the provider's 
participation agreement.  Such review shall be conducted by a group of individuals the 
majority of whom ... are members of the same profession as the provider who requests the 
review <b>and, for physicians, the same medical branch (allopathic or osteopathic 
medicine)."</b></td></tr></table></center>

<img src="joe.gif" align=right>
Joseph Kaczmarczyck, DO, an AOA member, was recently promoted to the position of chief medical officer of the Office of Minority and Women's Health (OMWH) at the Bureau of Primary Health Care. Dr. Kaczmarczyck previously served as an occupational medical consultant at the Bureau and the AOA strongly endorsed his promotion.
<p>
In his new position, Dr. Kaczmarczyck will oversee activities within OMWH aimed at improving the health status of women and minorities and  reducing the disparities in the healthcare provided to these populations. Such activities will involve fostering awareness in healthcare systems nationwide of the unique healthcare needs of  women and minorities, establishing  linkages with private and public sector organizations to promote resource sharing  and developing initiatives to ensure access to affordable, comprehensive and coordinated healthcare.
<p>
Dr. Kaczmarczyck is a commander in the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and has the distinction of being the only PHS medical officer who is board certified and trained in both obstetrics/gynecology and preventive/occupational medicine. He presently retains faculty appointments in ob/gyn and preventive medicine and biometrics at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. He is also a member of the American College of Osteopathic Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOOG) Board of Trustees and chairman of the ACOOG Ad Hoc Committee on Health Promotion for Women.

<h2>AHCPR unveils new program to replace Clinical Practice Guideline Program</h2>

The Agency for Health Care and Policy Research (AHCPR) announced at its last National Advisory Council  for Health Care Policy, Research and Evaluation meeting that it is replacing its Clinical Practice Guideline Program with the new Evidence-Based Practice Program. A congressional directive calling for the AHCPR to trim its research costs coupled with AHCPR's desired goal of producing more outcomes-based information were the catalysts for launching the new program.
<p>
At the ACHPR meeting, AOA Washington Office staffer Michael Conrad met with Doug Kamerow, MD, director of AHCPR's Office of the Forum, and Carolyn Clancy, MD, director of AHCPR's Primary Care Division, to discuss the status of the unfinished Chronic Pain: Headache clinical practice guideline. The AOA learned that the headache guideline will be published in a new report generated by the Evidence-Based Practice Program. 
<p>
Earlier this year, eight AOA members were chosen by the AHCPR to serve as peer reviewers for the headache guideline. These members are Barbara Briner, DO, Anthony Chila, DO, Gregory Dott, DO, Mitchell Elkiss, DO, Frederick Freitag, DO, R. Michael Gallagher, DO, Harvey Micklin, DO, and Paul Winner, DO.
<p>
The AHCPR told the AOA that all eight of our peer reviewers will be used to evaluate the  draft version of  the Chronic Pain: Headache Evidence-Based Practice Report when it is released next year. The AOA will inform members of  topics for the Evidence-Based Practice Reports when such information is made available by the AHCPR. The AOA will be working closely with the agency to ensure that there is continued input by osteopathic physicians in future Evidence-Based Practice Reports.
