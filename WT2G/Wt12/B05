A computer glitch in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange caused panic selling on 12
Dec 1996 when its Teletext information system incorrectly reported a drop of
515 points (or about 4%) of the Hang Seng Index during the opening minutes
of trading.

The error was blamed by a malfunction in the Automatic Order Matching and
Execution System (AMS), which calculates up to the minute stock prices
during trading hours.  The Stock Exchange had apparently alerted dealers
that there was a problem with the computer before trading began and were
advised to use prices shown in free text areas for calculating opening
quotations.  However, the Teletext system made no indication of the computer
glitch and instead displayed inaccurate stock prices until 20 minutes after
trading began.  The stock exchange is reviewing the incident.

Official figures for all indices and stock prices were finally released the
evening after the exchange closed.  The Hang Seng index, Hong Kong's main
stock index, ended the day down 136 points (1.0%) at 13053.28.  Volume was
just over US$1 billion.  The loss was partly blamed by the computer glitch.

&gt;From the KOMO (Radio/Television station) news web site, 12 Dec 96:

"A state computer might be the Grinch that is stealing Christmas for some
unemployed people. The computers cranked up two weeks ago to process claims
for unemployment insurance have "mislaid" checks for up to two-thousand
jobless people. The weekly checks are as much as 365 dollars
each. Employment Security commissioner Gary Moore notes that tens of
thousands of checks were properly sent out. He says the system works well,
but has some bugs that need to be worked out. But Moore also acknowledged
that people who haven't gotten their checks need the money, and waiting for
checks from the state is unacceptable."

As an "old-timer" in this field (and an IBM systems engineer -- customer
rep), we knew better than to assume that new software or hardware would work
correctly when first installed.  It would be considered negligence to
install something without running in parallel with the old system or
installing it at anything but a low-activity time.

There are way too many untrained and ignorant people out there selling
themselves as "consultants" or programmers.  I've even had high school
students tell me that they were hired to write safety-critical software.  Is
this their fault or the fault of people who think they can hire someone
without training or proper credentials to do these jobs?  I have never
understood what it is about computers that that makes people believe that
anyone can be an instant expert.

A lot of the user manuals for Macintosh applications are now published using
the .pdf format. They are expensive to print and hard to read on a monitor
with less than 1800 x 2400 pixel resolution. So a lot of people don't read
them.

Are there increased risks of various kinds from making user instructions
less accessible?

As reported in the New York Times, "Failure of Ticket Computer
Snarls Amtrak at Busy Time", Saturday 11/30/96, page 30.
Amtrak's Central Computer did not go "belly up", but the
communications/networking hardware that connects the ticketing
agents around the country to the Central Computer failed.

Starting about 12:30pm on friday, Thanksgiving weekend, Amtrak's
reservation and ticketing system for the entire country broke
down causing total chaos and long lines. As of late friday night
the system was still not working, But no train delays were reported.
Ticketing agents, dependent on the system and lacking
printed tables of fares, in many cases guessed at fares and
overcharged passengers.

While more information is needed, it seems strange that no Risk
Analysis was done prior to the breakdown to identify the piece of
communications hardware as a possible single point failure (SPF)?
Why wasn't a redundant communications link to the central computer
available? This is standard Avoidance and Diversity (A&amp;D)
provisioning.

Plus, a manual backup system should have been in place.  Ticketing
agents should have had up-to-date printed tables of fares and forms, like
the train conductors carry.

The trouble with the aviation accident statistics is that they only show
that new airframe and engine designs with glass cockpits are safer than old
airframe and engine designs with traditional controls. It could very well be
the case that great improvements in the reliability of new airframes and
engines are offsetting serious deficiencies in the modern controls. There is
a risk that manufacturers will hide behind the statistics and resist efforts
to determine the dangers and benefits of high levels of cockpit automation.

Speaking of not touching switches, I used to have a computer at work that
had an odd button design.  I don't want to say the name in public (Dell)
though.

The power switch was big and easy to see and stuck out from the case.  The
reset switch was about the size of a pencil eraser, and flush with the case
so that it could not be pushed with a finger.  I had to use a pen cap to
push the reset.

The only rational I could see is that they didn't want anyone pushing reset
by accident, even though I managed to shut down power on it once by accident
with my knee.  Yes, pushing reset is bad (except that it's the number one
solution given when you tell people that Windows isn't working right), but
pushing the power button is worse.  And that's exactly what's easiest to
push, and if you stuck an average computer illiterate user in front of it,
that's what they would push.  Even those who noticed the reset button might
mistakenly assume that because of the deliberate design that it would be
better to push power instead of reset (and maybe even start doing so on
other systems with better button design).

The RISKS?

As Nick put it, the police in many countries have a long way to go in their
understanding of computer crimes, however, just imagine what would have
happened if the police had acted 'appropriately'.  They would have impounded
ALL servers in the building that Mr. X had a login to, or any that he might
have been likely to have unauthorized access to.  They might have taken ALL
laser printers in the building.  Or at least the one that was Mr. X's
'default' so that they could examine it.  If Mr. X had access to other
machines at the site, they would have taken those as well.

The RISK is more complex than first thought.  The Jackson Games case in the
U.S. was fought on similar grounds - what is fair seizure and what is not?

I imagine that the "major computer company" might have had 'major'
problems had the police actually 'done their job'.

Council of European Professional Informatics Societies (CEPIS)
POLICY STATEMENT, 1996-October-20

Governmental Restrictions on Encryption Products Put Security at Risk

Worldwide, there is a political debate regarding the virtue or otherwise of
a control of encryption, in particular whether the import, export, and
production of cryptographic tools and their use should be restricted. In
several countries legal regulations exist, in some others steps are
undertaken towards such regulations. At present an OECD Committee is
drafting guidelines on cryptographic policy.

But there are concerns; the Council of European Professional
Informatics Societies (CEPIS) - with nearly 200,000 professionals in its 20
member societies, the largest European association of professionals working
in information technology (IT) - has agreed the following statement:

Should one wish to employ electronic communication as the main vehicle for
commercial and personal interaction, then one ought to be assured, and be
able to prove, that  messages are
- not disclosed to unauthorised recipients (confidentiality),
- not tampered with (integrity),
- shown to be from the senders stated (authenticity).

It has always been an aim of secure reliable communication to comply with
these requirements. The more the information society becomes a reality, the
more enterprises, administrations and private persons urgently need the
absolute assurance that these requirements are met.

To achieve this, so called "strong" cryptography is available. Several tools
based on strong crypto-algorithms are in the public domain and offered on
the Internet, others are integrated within commercial products.

A different technique for confidential and even unobservable communication
is to use steganography, where secret data are hidden within larger
inconspicuous everyday data in such a way that third parties are unable even
to detect their existence. Hence there is no way of preventing unobservable
secret communication.

To enable surveillance of electronic messaging, many criminal and national
security investigators, i.e. police and secret services, demand access to
keys used for encrypted communication.  In order for this to be effective,
escrowing (bonding) of these keys is advocated.  However, for the reasons
given above, key escrow (i.e. depositing copies of the keys with a "trusted
third party",including back ups) cannot even guarantee effective monitoring.
Moreover, key escrow already constitutes a risk for the secrecy of the keys
and therefore for the secrecy of the data. This risk is exacerbated in cases
of central escrowing.

Besides, the burdens of cost and administrative effort as well as the loss
of trust in communications could be significant and are prone to deter
individuals and organisations, especially small business users, from gaining
the benefits of modern information and communications systems.

Effective electronic surveillance of digital networks is difficult and time
consuming, and requires extensive resources.  In particular, closed groups
such as criminal organisations might even use steganographic techniques to
avoid any detection short of physical access to the terminals they use.
Thus restrictions on encryption may be of very limited help in the fight
against organised crime.  On the other hand, the essential security of
business and private communication may be seriously imperiled and
economically hampered should they be subjected to insufficiently secured key
escrow.

On these grounds, CEPIS recommends the following:

(1) The use of cryptography for identifying data corruption or
authenticating people/organisations should be free of restrictions and
encouraged by governments.

(2) All individuals and organisations in the private and public sectors
should be able to store and transmit data to others, with confidentiality
protection appropriate for their requirements, and should have ready access
to the technology to achieve this.

(3) The opportunity for individuals or organisations in the private and
public sectors to benefit from information systems should not be reduced by
incommensurable measures considered necessary for the enforcement of law.

(4) The governments of the world should agree on a policy relating to their
access to other people's computerised data, while seeking the best technical
advice available in the world on:

(4.1) whether and which access mechanisms to computerised data are an
effective, efficient and adequate way to fight (organised) crime and mount
effective prosecution of criminals, and

(4.2) how to implement the policy whilst minimising the security risks to
organisations and individual citizens.

(Evaluation and implementation of the policy will require regular review as
the technology evolves).

(This message was also sent to comp.protocols.dns.ops .)

The InterNIC (<A HREF="http://www.internic.net">http://www.internic.net</A>) is responsible for Internet domain
name service for all top-level domains, as well as for second-level domains
underneath all the old ARPA domains except MIL (EDU, GOV, NET, ORG, COM).
Until a few years ago, domain registration services were provided by the
InterNIC for free.  That changed when they convinced the NSF that its grant
money wasn't enough to cover their costs, so (amid much hubbub on the Net)
they started charging $50 per year for any second-level domain registration,
with the first two years (i.e., $100) payable in advance.

According to &lt;<A HREF="http://rs.internic.net/nic-support/nicnews/stats.html">http://rs.internic.net/nic-support/nicnews/stats.html</A>&gt;, the
InterNIC registered 638,788 new domains between August 1993 and September
1996.  If I'm doing my math right, at $100 per domain, that's almost $64
million, or over $20 million per year.  I would think that with that much
money, they'd be able to provide competent service to their customers.
Unfortunately, my experience has been that they're simply not doing an
acceptable job.  Some examples:

*****

* Their automated systems do not function properly.

They've introduced a PGP-based system for authentication of domain
contacts.  In other words, they allow domain contacts to register
their PGP public keys in the InterNIC public-key database, and then
requests which come from those contacts will only be accepted as
authentic if they are signed with the corresponding provide key.

Unfortunately, this system does not always work.  Recently, I
submitted a series of twelve database modification requests to the
InterNIC in a single day.  All of them were correctly signed with my
PGP key.  Of the twelve requests, three were returned to me in
messages beginning, "We are not able to verify the PGP signed message
that you sent us."

To make matters worse, for one of those three failed requests, I received
a message claiming the the modifications I'd requested had been completed,
two days *before* I received the message informing me that they were unable
to verify my PGP signature.

I have asked the InterNIC multiple times why their system randomly fails
to verify valid PGP signatures.  They have not responded to my inquiries.

Interestingly enough, another poster to comp.protocols.dns.ops claimed
that when he asked an InterNIC on the telephone about their PGP
authentication system, he was told that it is not currently working.  That
would seem to indicate that the InterNIC is aware that there are problems
with it, and yet they continue to advertise it on their Web site without any
indication that it might not work for any given request.

* There are some data in the database which are impossible to update using
the templates they provide.

One of the types of data stored in the InterNIC database is hosts; in
particular, hosts which act as domain-name servers for domains registered
with the InterNIC have records in the database.

Host records include an organization name and address associated with the
host.  And yet, the template for updating host records (available at
&lt;<A HREF="ftp://rs.internic.net/templates/host-template.txt">ftp://rs.internic.net/templates/host-template.txt</A>&gt;) does not have fields in
it for updating that information!  I believe that there are a couple of
other record types in the database which have this same problem.

This organization/address data has been described to me by an InterNIC
employee as an "old hold-over;" it seems that new host records do not have
organization and address data, but old ones do.  Nevertheless, one would
think that when switching to a new format for host records, the InterNIC
would have either removed the obsolete data from the old records or
established a procedure for updating it.

Instead, the only way to update this information electronically is to send
a plain-text message to <A HREF="mailto:hostmaster@internic.net">hostmaster@internic.net</A> explaining what you're
trying to do, and then hope that whoever reads your message will be
competent enough to understand what you're asking for and do the update by
hand.  Which brings me to my next point...

* When asked how to do something that is not handled automatically by their
templates, their staff give incorrect answers (or simply ignore the query)
more often than they give correct answers.

Of the twelve requests mentioned above, six of them were handled
improperly by the InterNIC staff members who processed them.  Iwn several
cases, I received a response instructing me to use a particular template to
make the changes I had requested, when in fact those changes had nothing
whatsoever to do with the template they told me to use.

I finally had to escalate my requests by sending "out-of-band" E-mail to
an InterNIC employee who has resolved problems of this sort for me in the
past, and she was able to "bounce" my requests to a high enough level that
they actually got processed.

Incidentally, the InterNIC introduced one or more typographical errors
into the data I sent them when processing six of my twelve requests (i.e.,
when they were done processing my requests, six of the twelve records I
asked them to modify had one or more typographical errors in them).

I suppose that sending incorrect answers is better than how things were a
few months ago -- then, if you sent a request that the person who read your
message did not know how to answer, he/she simply ignored it and sent no
response whatsoever.

* There are some data in their database which are impossible to update using
their current procedures.

Imagine this scenario... Joe Admin at Foo, Inc. is responsible for system
administration, including DNS administration.  He therefore has a contact
record in the InterNIC database indicating that he works for Foo, Inc., and
he is listed as a contact for various domain, network, and host records, in
the InterNIC database.

Now, he leaves the company and takes a new job, with no further contact
with Foo, Inc.  He doesn't bother to update his contact record in the
InterNIC database before he leaves.

Foo, Inc. would rather not let records remain in the InterNIC database
claiming that Joe works for them when in fact he does not.  Therefore, they
want to contact the InterNIC and tell them, "Look, the information in Joe
Admin's contact record which says that he for us is incorrect.  You can
confirm this by attempting to send E-mail to the address in the record, or
by calling the phone number in the record and asking to speak to him.  The
person who answers will confirm that he no longer works there.  Please
either delete the contact record completely or remove the information in it
which associates Joe Admin with Foo, Inc."

Sounds reasonable, right?  Well, unfortunately, the InterNIC has *no
procedures whatsoever* for allowing a company to remove contact information
which incorrectly lists them.

I attempted to do just what I described, i.e., to get the InterNIC to
remove the contact record for a former employee of OpenVision who no longer
works here, and who I cannot contact to ask him to update his own record
(and considering that it's not hurting him in any way, I don't see that he'd
have any incentive to update it even if I could ask him to).

After several rounds of E-mail with the InterNIC, they called me on the
telephone to discuss what I was trying to do.  Once on the phone with them,
I was "bounced up" through several layers of InterNIC staff, until I was
finally able to speak to a woman who was perfectly willing to admit that
yes, the scenario I described was a somewhat common one, and yes, it was
perfectly reasonable for a company not to want the InterNIC database to
associate non-employees with the company, but no, there's no way for anyone
but the owner of a contact handle to update it.  "Perhaps we need to
establish a procedure for that, and I'll be glad to discuss that for you
with our customer service manager, but we don't have one right now," she
said, and she did not offer to make an exception and handle my particular
request manually without the blessing of a "procedure".

Presumably, this means that I could edit my own contact handle to
indicate that I work for any company that I want, and that company
would have no way to get the InterNIC to remove the fraudulent
information.

Similarly, presumably, that means that (to be a little morbid for a
moment), if someone listed in the InterNIC database dies, there's no way for
anyone else to get the InterNIC to remove the deceased's record from the
database.

When I pressed the woman about this, she said to me, "If you're a network
administrator at this company, you presumably have control over the mail
server" (an assumption which is not always true, and indeed isn't true in
this case; although I can ask the people who administer the mail server to
make changes and hope that they'll listen, I don't have the ability to make
the changes directly).  "Well," she continued," if you send us a mail
message which claims to be from the former employee, asking for his record
to be deleted, we'll process it."

"Let me get this straight," I responded.  "You're telling me that I should
forge E-mail to your system in order to delete this record."  She confirmed
that interpretation.  I said, "Surely you see the absurdity of that."

She responded, "Well, obviously, ideally we wouldn't want anyone forging
requests to our system, but in this case, that's the only way for you to
delete the record."

"What if the former employee had associated a PGP key with his contact
record before he left the company."

"Well, in that case, you'd need his private PGP key in order to delete the
record."

"But surely you know that's impossible -- the whole point of PGP is that
only the owner a private key has access to it.  Even if I had access to the
file in which it was stored, I wouldn't know the correct password to unlock
it."

"Well, in that case, there would be no way for you to delete the record."

*****

There are a number of countries with strict laws about the collection of
private information in computerized databases.  Database maintainers are
required to seek permission from all individuals who have data about them
stored in the database, to guarantee the security of the database, and to
establish working procedures for keeping the data in the databases
up-to-date.

The United States has few such laws (there are laws about specific types of
databases, such as credit and medical records, but no laws about databases
in general).  Until I started dealing with the InterNIC, I didn't see much
point to them.  Well, I've changed my mind.  the InterNIC proves rather
clearly that left to their own devices, companies will not maintain
databases in a responsible manner.

Incidentally, nowhere on the InterNIC's WWW site can I find the address or
telephone number of the governmental office which oversees their grant and
handles complaints about their services.  Several months ago, I sent them
E-mail asking for them so that I could file a complaint, to be considered
the next time their grant comes up for renewal.  Like many of my other
messages to them, that request was ignored.

A California Franchise Tax Board computer apparently went berserk, resulting
in thousands of extra copies of 1996 tax forms being sent to California
businesses -- including a San Diego dentist who reportedly received about
16,000 copies of the 1996 forms.  [Source: An AP item in the *San Francisco

&gt;From Saturday's San Francisco Chronicle (Dec 14, page A20, also available
online: <A HREF="http://www.sfgate.com/wais/search/chron-pro.html">http://www.sfgate.com/wais/search/chron-pro.html</A>):

San Francisco fire officials acknowledged yesterday that communications
errors delayed the arrival of vital equipment at last month's huge fire at
Pier 48 -- the second time this year that the department has had problems
getting firefighters to major blazes."  [...]  According to [Deputy Chief]
Gamble, a dispatcher -- alerted to the waterfront fire at 2:48 p.m. --
initially sent only four pieces of equipment by computerized message when he
should have sent seven. Gamble said the dispatcher mistakenly entered into
the computer that the alarm had come from a street box, triggering a
relatively minimal first response.  The second error occurred when the first
units at the scene immediately called for help. At that point, Gamble said,
the dispatcher told the computer to send the next wave -- only to discover
six minutes later that the units never got the message.  Gamble explained
that because the dispatcher gave the computer the wrong message on the first
alarm, the computer wouldn't accept the second."  [...]

The RISK seems to be a user interface that makes it too easy to make
mistakes entering data, and "business rules" that assume that whatever was
previously entered into the computer is correct.

Response to query on laptop usage in PRC from a non-Sinologist

&gt;From Frank Conlon &lt;<A HREF="mailto:conlon@u.washington.edu">conlon@u.washington.edu</A>&gt;

With reference to Susan Blum's query, I cannot say anything at all about the
PRC, but will mention the strategy I followed whilst in India in 1990-91
using a laptop.

It may be too late or to unwieldy to use my approach, but what I did was buy
several extra storage batteries and a charger.  Except in Bombay city which
had a relatively stable power system, I never, that is NEVER, plugged my
computer directly into an electric source.  During my previous visit we had
purchased a top of the line, industrial strength surge protector made in the
U.S.A.  It lasted 6 days before the Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking sent a
spike through the line and blew the little hummer into the next world, if
there is a next world for surge protectors and transformers.

Instead, in 1990-91, since I had a computer that used batteries which could
be replaced and charged in a separate charging device, I just kept cycling
batteries through the charger and replacing them as needed.  Because I was
going to be there for almost a year, I purchased a substantial surge
protector in India--the sort folks there buy for their televisions and
refrigerators there.  Being manufactured in India meant that they were
engineered with a realistic grasp of the vagaries of most Indian power
supplies.  As the power surges came it buzzed and spat, but the battery
charger blissfully escaped unscathed.

Now if you are travelling around a lot, that might be inconvenient, and
perhaps such devices are not readily and cheaply available in China, but my
computer and data reached home safely, and the surge protector made a
handsome gift to one of the many folks who had done favors for me during my
stay.

Bon voyage, bon chance.

Repetitive Strain Injuries are a very common risk from computing; they can
easily lead to disabling injuries.  The fact that these people sustained
million dollar injuries give you an idea of how bad it can be...  However,
RSIs can be avoided with proper typing technique, ergonomics, stretching,
etc.  For instance, simpler than installing foot-pedals is to train oneself
to hit ctrl, shift, etc. with the index finger of the opposite hand.  For
tips about typing technique, and other information about RSIs, see
<A HREF="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/RSI">http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/RSI</A>, which is pretty good (OK, as the author I'm

CACM AIMS RIGHT BUT MISSES INFO-WARFARE TARGET

Yes, Neil Munroe aimed right, but as usual, he missed the Info-Warfare target.

He correctly identifies the problem - disruption (a.k.a., corruption and
denial of services) - but he misses the target by talking about privacy,
privacy, and more privacy.

The phone system could be brought down... but we have to protect privacy
The power grid could go down... but we have to protect privacy
Planes could crash... but we have to protect privacy

Questions: Suppose we had absolute and perfect privacy but still had the
current inadequate level of information assurance.

Could the phone system still be brought down? Yes
Could the power grid still be brought down? Yes
Could air traffic still be brought down? Yes
Does privacy protection solve the information assurance problem? NO!

Question: Suppose we had absolute and perfect information assurance.

Could we still have perfect privacy? Probably

So what is the relevance of the "... but we have to protect privacy" when
the issue is not privacy but assurance (integrity and availability)?

If we aim at information assurance and we keep hitting privacy, we will
never achieve our goal.

The target is NOT privacy!
This issue is NOT ABOUT PRIVACY!!
PRIVACY IS THE WRONG TARGET!!!

The right target is integrity and availability - a.k.a. information assurance.

How many times have I heard this misdirection? Hundreds at least. What's the
cause?  I don't know.

It could be that people think of computers as infallible and that
for that reason integrity and availability cannot be of concern.

It could be that people just don't understand.

It could be that the media attention and publicity is all aimed
at privacy. I've even seen media stories of computer viruses causing
computer crashes and heard the media people comment on how privacy
problems have to be addressed in order to solve this.

Get a clue!

How come the editors at the ACM couldn't figure this one out and tell the
author to hit the right target?

They must not have a clue!

How come the author calls the privacy advocates to find out about
information assurance?

He must not have a clue!

How come the FBI seems to think they need to tap phones to protect NII
integrity?

They certainly don't have a clue!

How come the president puts people without a clue in charge?

The president doesn't have a clue either!

As clueless Louis once said:
"If you want to make sure your phone works,
make sure your number isn't in the yellow pages."

Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 for Windows 95 maintains two special
folders. One, the 'Temporary Internet Files' folder, actually contains four
MS-DOS directories, used to cache HTML documents, GIFs, JPEGs and other
files downloaded from the Web. The other is the 'History' folder, which does
a similar caching task, but for URLs. Although each URL appears as a
separate entity in the folder they are actually stored in two .DAT files.

Clearing the History folder removes the entries visible in the Explorer
folder, but does not delete, or reinitialise the DAT files. These are still
visible using File Manager, and can be opened with a text editor to show all
the 'deleted' URLs. The files cannot be deleted by normal means including
first resetting attributes) from within File Manager or Explorer.
Presumably they are overwriten 'as needed' by new URLs.  Risks? We know
where you've been today...

A few days ago a non-technical neighbour of mine asked me to pop over and
check out the new Pentium PC she had bought for her family and herself.  She
is not particularly familiar with computers and this was her first PC.  Her
main concern was that the computer dealer was going to "come back in a few
days" to upgrade the Pentium Chip from a 133Mhz to 166Mhz and she wanted to
make sure she wasn't wasting her time installing any new software if the
upgrade was going to trash her hard disk.

The new machine was running Microsoft Windows '95 and the dealer had
helpfully renamed the "My Computer" icon on the desktop to say "Pentium 133"
- presumably as part of their standard installation process.  Fair enough.

My neighbour told me the dealer had told her that the machine was "running
at 95 percent full power" and that he would return in a few days to "switch
it to 166Mhz".  She *knew* it had 16MB of memory because the machine counted
it as part of the boot-up process when the machine is switched on.

When the dealer's technical guy arrived (1 week later) he didn't have any
parts or boards with him and he proceeded to rename the "My Computer" icon
from "Pentium 133" to "Pentium 166".  He fiddled around with the CD ROM (my
neighbour had asked him to fix an unhealthy vibration).  I hadn't told the
technical guy that I was computer literate (I have my own software company)
and he - wrongly - assumed that my neighbour's lack of knowledge was typical
of all in the house.

The dealer's employee completed his inspection of the CD ROM and put on his
coat ready to go.  My neighbour's inquiries of "Is the PC running OK now?"
were answered with assurances that all the work was completed and he was
ready to leave - all this without once opening the PC case.

One assumes that either the dealer has been charging customers for Pentium
166 chipped PCs and installing the cheaper processors or the dealer's
employee has been up to no good himself.  Either way, my neighbour would
have been no wiser - as far as she would have been able to tell the upgrade
had been carried out as agreed.  Technology is so advanced in her opinion
that she thought it possible to upgrade the PC merely by sitting at the
keyboard and typing.  The processor inside the machine was actually a true
Intel Pentium 133 (I checked!) but it could have been a Pentium 90, Cyrix or
indeed just about anything else and a non-technical user would have had very
little obvious way of checking.

The risks?

Just because a PC says it has a Pentium 133 inside it doesn't actually mean
that it has.  Just because someone says with authority that everything is as
it should be it doesn't actually mean that it is.  And always get a second
opinion if you are about to spend a lot of money on something you don't
really understand.

Needless to say my neighbour (and her rather large and incensed husband)
took the PC back to the dealer and demanded her money back (which was
finally paid by cheque even though she paid cash).

BEWARE OF YEAR2000 SHARKS:  A STORY FOR NON-BELIEVERS

I offer the following story as a different slant on the effect Year2000 may
have on companies.  The Year2000 Shark may be after your customers too...

I was sitting in the waiting room of a tire-repair shop.  The room was
dingy, and the owner/manager behind the counter was covered in tire carbon
from head to foot.  Into this scene walked a well-dressed arrogant-looking
fellow with a meek assistant.  He walked up to the counter and assertively
asked the manager if he knew whether his credit-card authorization system
was Year2000-compliant. Needless to say, the manager was clueless.

The salesman offered to test the store's CC unit with a test card.  No
sooner had the manager given the slightest nod of agreement, the salesman
was swiping his card through the unit and pointing triumphantly at the
message that popped up saying the card was invalid.  "This card," he said,
"has an expiration date of January 30, 2000.  This system is not
Year2000-compliant.  May I ask where you got this system and how much you
paid for it..."

That manager was helplessly snowed by the circumstances.  If there was some
way for him to require that salesman to legitimize himself (and his test
card), it didn't occur to him.  I thought about stepping in, but wanted to
see where things went first.  The manager succeeded in fending off the
salesman's push for an immediate sale, so I figured he'd be OK.

THE MORAL: Even companies who have dealt with the Year2000 problem
effectively need to ensure that their customers do not fall prey to such
sharks or wily competitors who may seize the opportunity caused by the lack
of information. I'm not a marketing person, but I imagine marketing staffs
around the business world will be "strategizing" on this very soon, if they
haven't already started...

[It is] even harder to read on monitors with 80x8 pixel resolution, or 2x8
pixel resolution (Braille readers) or without a monitor at all (Speech
synthesis). Not to mention simply difficult to read if your monitor doesn't
match the aspect ratio of the original page.

As far as I can see, the risks are monumental. From my viewpoint, a format
like HTML (which was designed to be accessible to everyone and every piece
of software) is far, _far_, superior to a system which hands you dressed up
photographs of each page in turn.

It may be simple for companies to produce .pdf documentation, but by doing
so they sharply curtail the usefulness of the information.

I'm sure glad I don't use a user-hostile system like a Mac.  Instead, I use
a user-hostile IBM compatible.  My fun has been with Microsoft Visual FoxPro
5.0.

The Language Reference manual supposedly is a language reference manual, but
it isn't.  It has information on the syntax of the command, what the
arguments are, BUT LITTLE TO NOTHING ABOUT THE SEMANTICS.

Fortunately, that is available in the on-line documentation.  Needing a
language reference manual, you might want to print all of the on-line docs.
So you print it out.  (Cost?)  Then you find that the heading isn't printed.
With most of the commands, the syntax diagram just down from the top has the
item name, but with some retained for backward compatibility, they are only
documented with something like "This feature retained for backward
compatability.  Use &lt;something else&gt; instead." and nothing else.

Did you want to print the topics more than one at a time?  To do that, you
put the topics you want into the on-line docs notepad (where they are listed
in reverse order), print them (and find they print in reverse order (A nice
match!)), and then delete them from the notepad (ONE at a time).

Are you finding this confusing?  Try the on-line help for the on-line
documentation.  I got lost.  It's the worst on-line help I've ever read.

The RISK?  A customer (me) could refer to your manuals as "flingware" and
raise hell with technical support.  He might also switch to another product.
(If the product itself wasn't reasonable, I might have.)  VFP looks good,
but if you can't get it going...

WOMEN INTO COMPUTING CONFERENCE 1997 IN ASSOCIATION
WITH CENTRE FOR COMPUTING AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

To be held at De Montfort University, Milton Keynes, UK.
10th July - 12th July 1997

*** PAPER SUBMISSIONS DUE 6 January 1997 ***

PROGRESSION:   FROM WHERE TO WHAT?

Computing and information technologies are now ubiquitous and of vital
importance in the global society.  Gender related issues in computing
continue to be critical in realising the potential of these technologies.
Computing as a discipline has a clear gender imbalance.  Recent figures show
recruitment of women into the discipline is continuing to decline.

To date, significant determinants of women's success in the computing field
have been explored primarily in terms of societal, cultural and
organisational work factors.  The perspective of women computer
technologists and engineers has often been overlooked.  Tensions between the
different groups exist but there has been insufficient dialogue between
these different groups to date.  This conference will address this situation
and provide an opportunity for a greater understanding between all those
working in and associated with computing.

Papers are invited within the broad area of Gender related computing
research.  This includes but is not limited to:-

1.  Telematics -the field of computer mediated communication.
2.  Women systems/software engineers - a contradiction in terms?
3.  Professionalism, legislation and the role of women.
4.  Women Returners
5.  'Man Machine' Interface to 'human Computer' Interface to what?
6.  Feminist perspectives in computing research.
7.  Education - computing education and the use of computers in education.

An underlying theme of the conference is to be social responsibility and
therefore we wish to encourage papers emphasising this and ethical issues.
Papers taking different cultural, national and societal aspects are
particularly welcome as are globally oriented papers.

In addition, we are looking for sister organisations throughout Europe to
participate in the conference.  The aim is to report on European Women's
Organisations, initiatives and relevant research.  We will be maximising
participation through the use of video conferencing services at De Montfort
University.

For further details, or if you would like to register an intention to submit
or participate in the conference, please email : <A HREF="mailto:wic97@dmu.ac.uk">wic97@dmu.ac.uk</A>
We will then add you to our mailing list for registration

Periodically I remind you of TWO useful digests related to privacy, both of
which are siphoning off some of the material that would otherwise appear in
RISKS, but which should be read by those of you vitally interested in
privacy problems.  RISKS will continue to carry general discussions in which
risks to privacy are a concern.

* The PRIVACY Forum is run by Lauren Weinstein, with some support from the
ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy.  He manages it as a rather
selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the full
range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
(with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
Forum, please send the exact line:

information privacy

as the first text in the BODY of a message to:

<A HREF="mailto:privacy-request@vortex.com">privacy-request@vortex.com</A>

You will receive a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit
contributions, send to "<A HREF="mailto:privacy@vortex.com">privacy@vortex.com</A>".

Information and materials relating to the PRIVACY Forum may also be
obtained from the PRIVACY Forum Archive via ftp to "ftp.vortex.com",
gopher at "gopher.vortex.com", and World Wide Web via:
"<A HREF="http://www.vortex.com">http://www.vortex.com</A>".  Full keyword searching of the PRIVACY
Forum Archive is available through the World Wide Web access address.

* The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
<A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy@uwm.edu">comp-privacy@uwm.edu</A> and administrative requests to
<A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu">comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu</A>.

There is clearly much potential for overlap between the two digests,
although contributions tend not to appear in both places.  If you are very
short of time and can scan only one, you might want to try the former.  If
you are interested in ongoing discussions, try the latter.  Otherwise, it
may well be appropriate for you to read both, depending on the strength of
your interests and time available.

According to John Hammerschmidt of the NTSB, preliminary investigations into
the freighter *Bright Field* crashing into the Riverwalk in New Orleans
suggest that an oil-pump failure caused the ship's computer to automatically
reduce speed.  A standby pump kicked in, but under reduced power the ship's
maneuverability was decreased.  The impact cut a 200-foot swath into shops
and a hotel condominium complex, and the pedestrian walkway.  A language
barrier between the Chinese-speaking captain (and crew) and the
English-speaking pilot reportedly may also have contributed.  The
Liberian-registered 69,000-ton ship was not equipped with a U.S.-recommended
voice recorder, and a second voice recorder was not functioning.  Coast
Guard Captain Gordon Marsh confirmed that large ships lose steering power as
often as once a week.  [Source: various news items, including *San Francisco

[... see previous item ...]

The pilot appears to have performed a miraculous job of parallel-parking the
761-foot vessel in the 900-foot space between two heavily populated
entertainment boats.

The RISK? While [the automatic reactions] clearly saved an engine that
likely costs millions to rebuild, could the sacrifice of the engine have
prevented the collision?  Or would have the engine exploded; throwing LARGE
pieces around and killing people that way?

Is the low-speed version of the Airbus dilemma -- who knows more; the pilot
or the computer?

A 200-message-per-second SYN-flood attack (see <A HREF="/Risks/18.45.html">RISKS-18.45</A> for the precursor
PANIX attack, and <A HREF="/Risks/18.48.html">RISKS-18.48</A> for some defenses) was launched against WebCom
(a large WWW service provider), affecting more than 3000 Web sites for 40
hours during most of what was otherwise a very busy shopping weekend.  The
attack began Saturday morning PST shortly after midnight.

The initial attack triggered an automatic pager warning.  WebCom engineers
then traced the attack back to PSINet.  Ten hours later PSINet traced it to
MCI lines.  MCI traced the attack route back to CANet, an ISP in Ontario,
and then back to BC.Net.  WebNet was unable to stanch the flood, so MCI
finally blocked all traffic from CANet to WebCom -- allowing WebCom to
restore service.

Apparently, WebCom had experienced a milder SYN attack the weekend before,
so it was better prepared than it might have been otherwise.

In an amusing twist on the now-tired practice of slamming, Connecticut's
Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) had 6 of its 14 long-distance
lines switched involuntarily from MCI to Wiltel.  The story, run today (17
Dec) as a full-width headline on the front page of the Hartford Courant,
quotes a DPUC employee: "They did WHAT???  Excuse me, we're the DPUC, and we
got slammed?"

The change was orchestrated and confirmed by SNET, the local telephone
monopoly; SNET also confirmed that Wiltel (owned by WorldCom, of Jackson
Mississippi, and the fourth largest long distance carrier) had sent a
request to SNET that the switchover be made.

The practice of slamming is so common that it behooves regulators to
consider how the infrastructure might be altered to make the practice
impossible. As a starting point, the hand-written signature of the client
(or representative thereof) should be required for any change of service,
but future systems will surely involve digital signatures which are issued
on a per-call basis. As the line between packet-switched networks and
pseudocircuit-switched networks continues to blur, a new type of competition
will eventually come to the fore.  In the future, we should expect smart
telephones to automatically choose the cheapest route to a destination.

In the meantime, with customers essentially at the mercy of whimsical
telephony moguls, only two policies are viable: either avoid becoming
a dialtone customer in the first place (avoiding both slamming, and
outright theft of service by phone card and cell phone profile
trafficking rings), or be eternally vigilant.

U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel has ruled in favor of Daniel
Bernstein, whose Snuffle encryption program (and corresponding Unsnuffle for
decryption) had been considered a munition under the ITAR regulations -- and
therefore subject to export controls.  She ruled that the government
restrictions on the export of encryption programs are an unconstitutional
interference with freedom of speech.  However, the ruling does not extend to
the constitutionality of the export controls themselves.  Somewhat
curiously, the ruling is not applicable outside of California's Northern
District (e.g., Silicon Valley).

Earlier, dissemination of his research paper describing the algorithm had
been blocked by the State Department in 1993.  However, when that paper was
deemed distributable abroad in 1995, the distribution of the software itself
was still subject to export controls -- whereupon Bernstein sued.  (See

German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet has approved a bill that seeks to
protect Internet users' privacy and prevent smut and Nazi propaganda.  The
new law covers businesses such as telebanking and database services, as well
as online services.  Perhaps redundant, acts already prohibited in Germany
such as conducting fraudulent business -- will also be illegal
electronically.  Responsibility for suspect content is on the ``suppliers'',
not the service providers.  The law requires the use of ``digital
signatures''.  It bans certain forms of tracking of individual usage, and
encourages some anonymity.  It also calls for descriptors that would permit
automatic filtering of material unsuitable for minors.  [Sort of a minor's

Way back in <A HREF="/Risks/13.40.html">RISKS-13.40</A>, I complained about New York's plan to install
fingerprinting systems for welfare recipients.  Back then the fraud was
estimated to be between $150 million and $2 billion, give or take 3 decimal
places.

I now live in Connecticut, and the 12 Dec 1996 _New Haven Advocate_ reports
that the Connecticut fingerprinting system (to catch welfare recipients
"red-handed") cost $5.1 million.  The system has discovered six *possible*
cases of fraud out of 70,000 recipients.  That's $850,000 each for people
who receive $300 a month.

Of course, the state maintains that the system has worked as a scarecrow and
that an estimated 3,000 of the 7,000 people who never showed up to be
fingerprinted probably never will.  So there.

This isn't the first time that flimsy science is invoked in a hot-button
political issue.  Troubling questions remain:

(1) Does the fingerprinting system work as intended, i.e. is it
an accurate biometric device?  How many are wrongly accused of
being welfare cheats?  How many cheats does the system miss?
(2) How much fraud is there in the welfare system?  Approximately?
(3) In the absence of answers to 1 &amp; 2, how do we judge if these
systems are worth their price?
(4) Is it appropriate to subject welfare recipients to this
additional burden, or is it intended to demean and demoralize
an already disadvantaged group?
(5) Of those who are afraid, for whatever reason, to be
fingerprinted, how many are being denied legitimate benefits?
(6) Who in the political system cares about any of this?

If things continue this way, the states will probably blow their block
grants on those new millimeter wavelength holographic imaging scanners...

One of the utilities that comes with NCSA httpd -- a cgi program called phf
-- has a serious security hole.  With a suitable URL, it can be tricked into
sending the /etc/passwd file to any user.  A number of computers here at
Yale School of Medicine have been compromised in this manner.

To check whether YOUR password file has been downloaded:

egrep 'phf' /etc/httpd.dir/logs/access_log | grep 'passwd'
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (or wherever your WWW server log is)

When I checked the logs on our WWW servers, I found that people in several
different countries have recently downloaded /etc/passwd files.  So the bad
guys know about this one.  Many bad guys know about this one.

IF YOU HAVE BEEN HIT BY THIS, then:

1. disable the phf script until you can install a version that refuses
to display the password file

2. CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDS!  When you do, choose passwords that will resist
cracking with a dictionary.  Remember that under most flavors of Unix
only the first 8 characters of a password matter, so a password like
apricot57tree is really just apricot5 to a cracker!

With Java, there was a sort of `Java virus' scare. Remember, anyone?  It
ended up being an application that put a load on your processor.  It was
real tough to hit that Back or Stop button in Netscape to stop the
application, and then not go to that site anymore. Java programmers were
quick to point out that the Java language can't access your operating system
at all, much less do any damage.

But with Microsoft's Active-X, there are many more serious concerns.  A
programmer can access your memory and disk i/o sub-systems using Microsoft's
Active-X. What does that mean? Well, ... the easiest thing a malicious
person would do is plant a virus quietly on your system, or simply delete
important files. But I believe Gates' plan is to be able to extract more
information from your system. What? Forget so soon that when you
electronically register Win95, your directory tree structure and other
information is sent to M.$.  with your registration info?

This a quote from `Computerworld'. December 2, 1996 Vol. 30 No.49
On page 139 you'll find ...

*_*_*_*_Quote Begin

FIX ACTIVE-X SECURITY PROBLEMS. Objects built with ActiveX can access system
resources on users' desktops, which can lead to security breaches or
corruption of PC data. Microsoft's answer is to provide certification the
ActiveX code comes from the developer that users think it comes from. But
that isn't good enough, said Oliver Pflug, president of SiteCast. Users must
"set up software to receive certificates, understand the entire process and
have a way of verifying the certificate," he said. "It's awkward."

*_*_*_*_Quote End

Is this what you want when using the Internet? To have to worry about
properly setting up software to prevent people from taking advantage of
M.S.'s intentional security flaws? And even then, this doesn't prevent a
`certified' content provider from accessing data from your system.

At Comdex it was finally made public knowledge that Billyboy plans on
creating a `Microsoft Java.' Why? Because as hard as Microsoft tried, it
couldn't take over and control the development of the real Java. So now
instead of supporting something that would be a good thing, Gates wants to
use strong-arm tactics to wipe out something that works well and replace it
with his versions and `visions' of how he feels it should be. Of course,
people are hard at work making M.S. Java incompatible with what is out there
now. And code is already being worked on that will enable M.S. Java to be
able to extract information from your system while you use the Web, just as
ActiveX does now.

It's bad enough that Microsoft can retrieve stuff from your hard drive, but
here's one thing I really fear ... As you may know, web pages are stored on
your hard disk in a cache as you view them. Frequently accessed sites can be
retrieved from there and displayed more quickly. But say someone writes some
Active-X or M.S. Java code to randomly grab a couple of those cache files
while you view their web page? Let's say they get one where you entered your
credit card # to order that rare Pink Floyd album from a record dealer on
the web. Or possibly a file on your disk that contains sensitive personal or
business information?

All I can say is... Be afraid of using M.S. products, be very afraid.

I am quite surprised that our esteemed moderator allowed Mr. Cohen's rather
excitable, accusatory, and low-content article to be published as it
appeared.  Peter must have been having a busy day, or perhaps this was the
cleaned-up version.  [Geoff, You are kind.  But I try not to be a draconian
censor -- only a moderator.  Besides, it triggered *your* response.  PGN]

In any case, I fear that it is Mr. Cohen who misses the point.  The issue is
not one of cluelessness, it's one of priorities.  Mr. Cohen asks:

&gt; Questions: Suppose we had absolute and perfect privacy but still had the
&gt; current inadequate level of information assurance.
&gt;
&gt; 	Could the phone system still be brought down? Yes
&gt; 	Could the power grid still be brought down? Yes
&gt; 	Could air traffic still be brought down? Yes
&gt; 	Does privacy protection solve the information assurance problem? NO!
&gt;
&gt; Question: Suppose we had absolute and perfect information assurance.
&gt;
&gt; 	Could we still have perfect privacy? Probably

The point Mr. Cohen misses is that for some of us, privacy is vastly more
important than information assurance.  I'm not willing to accept his
"probably."  So all I have to do is turn his questions around, replacing all
of his yesses with "probably" or even just "maybe," note that we could then
have perfect privacy, and for me the decision is preferable.  It's hardly an
accident that the Founding Fathers of the United States chose to make law
enforcement more difficult than it has to be.

Some of us (e.g., many FBI employees) place security above liberty.  Others
prefer the reverse choice.  In neither case does that reflect on the quality
of our reasoning.

Mr. Cohen is not clueless, but neither am I.  I am, however, trying to be
somewhat more polite.

<A HREF="/Risks/18.65.html">RISKS-18.65</A> contains an item "Software hunts and kills Net viruses" (Hans
A. Rosbach) that refers to a London *Times* article of the same title.  (The
*Sunday Times*, 1 Dec 1996, Innovations: Bits &amp; Bytes.)  Curiously, the same
section of the Times includes articles entitled "Skull pins keep wigs in

pages/sti/96/12/01/stiinnbit01003.html?1483095.)

Despite the fact that the article quotes me by name, as far as I know I was
not interviewed by the *London Times*, and certainly the article gives an
inaccurate account of IBM AntiVirus.

It is true that IBM AntiVirus contains a neural network which detects new
viruses by generalizing from old ones.  It is also true that we are building
towards an "immune system for cyberspace", whose functions will include an
automated analysis of any new virus detected on a machine, and transmission
of the results --- notably a procedure for removing the virus --- to
affiliated machines.  The prototype software is undergoing extensive
testing, and will not be released until we are confident of its reliability.

We would of course never design a program to spread to any system
whose owner hadn't explicitly arranged for it to be there, nor do we
have any release scheduled for this week.

For those interested in the technical details, let me also mention that
temporal difference learning has nothing to do with the neural network in
IBM AntiVirus.  Temporal difference learning was used for the very powerful
backgammon-playing neural network developed by Gerry Tesauro, and Gerry also
helped develop the anti-viral neural net, but there is no other connection
between the backgammon network and the anti-viral one.

To Persons Interested in Security in Distributed Object Systems,
the deadline for workshop participation is 20 Dec 1996.

FIRST WORKSHOP ON BUILDING AND USING CORBASEC ORBS
Marriott Inner Harbor, Baltimore, MD 21201, 1-3 April 1997
Co-Sponsored by the Object Management Group and the National Security Agency

The Object Management Group (OMG) CORBA specification includes security
protocols and services that are being widely adopted.  Unfortunately, a full
understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the security aspects of the
CORBA standards requires experience with Object Oriented Technology,
Information Technology Security and operational system planning, development
and deployment. OMG is hosting this workshop to bring together individuals
with varying sets of these types of experience to examine, explain and
critique the adopted OMG security specifications and other similar and
related work.

The workshop approach will be to have individuals with the full range of
OOT, IT Security, and Operational System experience examine and discuss, in
turn, the content and meaning of the CORBA Security standards, the design
issues relevant to realizing the CORBA Security standards in ORBs, and the
design issues relevant to using ORBs meeting the CORBA Security standards as
the foundation for operational systems.

Interested individuals or organizations are invited to submit a brief
position statement of one printed page (or 60 80-character email lines of
text) outlining a position on one or more of the three major categories
[CORBA security standards, Secure ORB design issues, Secure ORB usage
issues] by 20 December 1996 to <A HREF="mailto:secws-submissions@omg.org">secws-submissions@omg.org</A> .  [Contact Richard

PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS
NEW SECURITY PARADIGMS '97
A workshop sponsored by ACM and the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.
Langdale Hotel, Great Langdale, Cumbria, UK
23 - 26 September 1997

Paradigm shifts disrupt the status quo, destroy outdated ideas, and open the
way to new possibilities.  This workshop explores deficiencies of current
computer security paradigms and examines radical new models which address
those deficiencies.  Previous years' workshops have identified problematic
aspects of traditional security paradigms and explored a variety of possible
alternatives.  Participants have discussed alternative models for access
control, intrusion detection; new definitions of security, privacy, secrecy
and trust; biological and economic models of security; multiple policies;
and a wide variety of other topics.  The 1997 workshop will strike a balance
between building on the foundations laid in past years and exploring in new
directions.

[This is an important workshop, but attendance is limited to about 25
people.  Somewhat surprisingly, the committee folks in the full notice
total 23, but I suppose that they are not all going to attend.  To
participate, please get from Mary Ellen Zurko or Catherine Meadows the
full information regarding your submitted paper, justification for your
would-be invitation, and your commitment to attend all three days, which
must be received by 4 April 1997.  PGN]

Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) had another bad day.  At 7am, a ghost train
appeared at the San Francisco 24th Street station, requiring manual
operation through that station.  Independently, three trains had to be taken
out of service because of mechanical problems.  All of this caused a
15-minute delay systemwide.  Later, a computer crash caused delays up to 30
minutes systemwide, from 5:50pm to 9:45pm on 19 Dec 1996.

BART also had a serious power cable outage in the transbay tunnel on 12 Dec
1996 (not previously reported here by itself, because of its lesser
relevance to the computer systems -- although it certainly had a major
effect on the system as a whole).  That cable problem was traced to sloppy
maintenance after the cable was damaged way back when it was installed back
in the early 1970s.  BART now observes that an overall cable overhaul had
been considered prior to the 12 Dec outage as an urgent step in upgrading
the aging infrastructure.

Reading some back issues of RISKS, I realised how many of the incidents and
problems reported are due to systems (embedded and otherwise) getting old.
The "system" (made up of the people who use it, as well as all the computer
"systems") has to be able to cope with the oldest and newest technology in
it, and all the breakdowns in all the (non-upgradable) component systems.
With the pace of change in technology (try buying a 1 megabyte SIMM), we are
going to find ourselves more and more unable to maintain the systems we
build.

Current examples are such things as: air-traffic-control computers being
kept going long after the manufacturer can officially no longer supply the
spares, by wizened (i.e., over-45) hardware engineers with soldering irons
and a bag of those big fat 20-watt resistors; car "computers" which tell you
the car's average speed over the last hour, for the first four years of the
car's life, and then flash "88 8888" at you unless you spend $1250 for a
replacement unit; a four-year-old PC for which you can't buy a new disk
drive (the BIOS can't handle anything bigger than 512 MB).

Future examples: anything with a smart card in it; the often-documented
problem of reading information stored on 30-year-"guaranteed"-lifetime
optical disks in 30 years when the disk might be readable, but no computer
system can connect to the drive; and of course the year 2000.

People are very good at adapting to change (once they get over the emotional
hurdle of accepting it's going to happen) and working with the limitations
of old and new; just look at any home with items as diverse as a TV and a
toilet.  Computer systems aren't at all good at it, and anything with
firmware is just disastrous.

Here's a little test for readers who work in systems specification.  Have
you ever seen a requirements, functional, or design specification for any
computer application system that specified not just the hoped-for start date
for production use of the system (you know, the one where you have to
subtract a year for political reasons, even though you know there's no way
it'll be ready in time), but also the END date, after which the system would
be taken out of use and replaced with something else?  For advanced
students: what would have been the effect on any given project of doing so?

This week's L.A. Weekly (Vol. 19, No. 4, page 15) has a story about
inaccuracies in the Los Angeles Police Department's Police Arrest and Crime
Management Information System (PACMIS).

The following is my summary of some RISKy aspects of the story.

The article focuses on a doughnut shop in Van Nuys.  Because the shop is the
closest establishment to the street in a mini-mall, many incidents nearby
bear its address in police records.  That may be useful for getting officers
to the scene quickly, but it resulted in the shop being described as a
"disorderly establishment" because of the number of crimes recorded at its
address, the majority of which had no connection with the doughnut shop.

The article paints PACMIS records as being very inaccurate.  The examples
cited include multiple entries for the same incident, and an entry that
described a nearby jay-walking citation as a "felony prostitution" arrest on
the premises of the doughnut shop.

PACMIS is not intended to be used for "evidentiary purposes", but the story
claims PACMIS reports are used to influence zoning board hearings and other
nuisance-abatement measures.

The story doesn't describe what PACMIS's original purpose was.

It sounds to me like a typical instance of the risks of inaccurate data and
of using data for other purposes than those for which it was collected.

The Superintendent of the Palisades Park, NJ, school system had to explain
to the School Board an $875 bill from a 16-year-old "hacker" who was hired
to break into the schools computer system. The 19 Aug 1996 meeting was
reported by the AP, and was carried by most national newspapers, such as the
*Richmond Times-Dispatch*, 22 Aug 1996, "Hacker frees transcripts", page
A16.

It seems that some students or former students, whose plans had changed,
desperately needed transcripts sent off over the summer. The computer and
database containing the students' records were locked via passwords, and no
one who knew the passwords could be reached.  The principal and former vice
principal were on vacation and unreachable. The school employee who had the
codes was recently incapacitated by a stroke. Members of the guidance
department were furloughed for the summer because of the school's budget
crunch and could not be found.

The school's computer coordinator asked the 16-year-old "computer whiz" to
break into the system, and unlock the files so the various transcripts could
be printed. He did, and billed the school system $25 an hour for 35 hours of
work.

I believe this story shows the Risks of security, password access, and
encryption systems, and the need for built-in "Key Recovery"
architectures. Businesses and other organizations cannot be put at Risk,
when critical information cannot be unlocked because of an employees
absence, incapacitation, or lost keys and passwords.

Companies like AccessData, Orem, UT, do quite a lot of business in terms
of password recovery for unlocking files. Unfortunately, these techniques,
or the techniques used by the "hacker" would not be effective in systems
using modern security and cryptography.

"Key Recovery" or "Key Archival" has long been recognized as a necessary
function and service of security and cryptographic systems.  While it is
true, that in the U.S., a Court could order that one of the archived
keys/passwords be released to the court, there are legal and procedural
safeguards in place.  There are far greater risks, such as losing the
key/password, and having critical information lost and undecipherable.  In
the case above, the future livelihoods and careers of the students who
immediately needed their transcripts would have been put at risk if they
were unable to unlock the passwords.

Robert J. Perillo, CCP                 <A HREF="mailto:Perillo@dockmaster.ncsc.mil">Perillo@dockmaster.ncsc.mil</A>

[Reminder: RISKS readers will undoubtedly be able to make the distinction
between "key recovery" for stored data and "key recovery/archive/escrow/
or-whatever" for communications.  The situations are quite different.
RISKS readers will of course also be familiar with the potential risks
inherent in the presence of any mechanism that allows key recovery by an
untrustworthy third party.  PGN]

Much British media panic has been devoted to the recent conviction of an
"ATM gang" of high ambition. A collection of high-grade villains with
impeccable pedigrees in robbery, gangsterism and drugs dealing over 30 years
compelled a software expert who was in prison for attacking his wife and
child to help them in their enterprise. The man revealed his role to a
prison chaplain and subsequently acted as an undercover informer on his
release.

The plot was to tap telephone lines carrying encrypted ATM card details to
and from the banks, especially the Visa and Access (Mastercard's name in the
UK) centres in Essex. Having decrypted the information, fake ATM cards with
genuine cardholders' details would be manufactured from the 140,000 blanks
they had bought. Teams of associates armed with the cards would then assault
thousands of ATMs in the UK and abroad.

The media response, based on the claims of the prosecution, said the plot
had "put the entire banking system in danger". Not only that, but
prosecution estimates of the potential proceeds were put at about L800
million, with chief counsel adding that in fact, "the sky was the limit".

The claims of the prosecution were alarmist, even if the conspirators were
in deadly earnest, and bear the hallmarks of media fantasies about the true
level of risk in bank security (see suspicions about the Sunday Times
reporting on this in <A HREF="/Risks/18.17.html">RISKS-18.17</A>). The logistics alone of the planned ATM
raids would have been horrendous. It would have been extremely difficult for
a "raider" to use more than one ATM card after another at one machine
without raising immediate suspicions. Typically, ATM cards have withdrawal
limits no higher than L200 in the UK, often much lower, depending on the
status of the account.

If one imagined that one person could cover, say, 50 machines in a -- very
busy -- day and got L200 from each machine, he would clear L10,000 in one
day. If, say, 100 gang members could withdraw that much each per day (a
generous estimate), it would take them 160 days of continuous raiding to
reach the prosecution figure of L800 million. It seems highly probable that
within a short time of the raids beginning, alarm bells would go off
throughout the banking system and ATMs would either be closed down, put
under surveillance, or new, lower limits on all cards imposed by the
banks. (There would be loss of a public confidence in ATMs, but hardly a
collapse of the banking system). Security cannot be good in a gang that big,
and the chances of one of them being caught and spilling the beans,
especially after the tremendous hue and cry that would have gone up, would
have been very high.

Code-breaking gangsters?

But could they have got that far? Newspaper reports failed to emphasise the
all-important question as to whether the encrypted information could be
decoded.  Defence counsel were scathing about the possibilities and called
experts to testify that it was effectively impossible. One of the defence
barristers said: "The basic method was fatally flawed ... because the
encryption system used by the banks is so secure that no current technology
available in the world, not even the combined expertise of the world's
leading scientists, is capable of breaking it."

The judge appeared to accept this, with a proviso. Addressing the
defendants, he said in sentencing them: "It was not possible for you, with
the equipment and expertise then at your disposal, to carry out this fraud
to a successful conclusion. There is, in particular, no evidence that the
cards recovered by the police would then work or that the codes had then
been broken. However, beyond that I'm not prepared to go. I do not believe
it is necessary to go further but for the avoidance of doubt I make it clear
that it would, in my judgment, be irresponsible and wrong on the basis of
the information before me to accept any additional assurances along the
lines that this is a fraud that no one could ever commit."

Lawyers being what they are, the judge could not exclude the possibility
that the decryption was possible, even though the remoteness of that
possibility does not seem to have struck home, particularly when it is
considered that the gang's only computer expert was working against
them. The gang's expert claimed no expertise in cryptography and yet said in
evidence that there had been a successful decryption dry run. This was not
corroborated elsewhere, and the judge did not accept it.

The case in court did not, as a result, measure up to the headlines. In
fact, the prosecution had decided from the start only to charge the men with
conspiracy to steal, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years,
instead of conspiracy to defraud, which carries a maximum of 14 years. For
the latter charge to succeed, the Crown would have had to convince the jury
that the defendants had "a reasonable chance of success". Despite the gang
spending some L100,000 in the purchase of equipment, making numerous
clandestine visits to British Telecom telephone exchanges, and suborning
about three BT engineers, the prosecution realised such a charge would fail.

The judge kept his head and, in the end, the ringleader was sentenced to
only five years in prison, some subordinates to four and three years, and
the man whose heavily guarded country home was the headquarters for the plot
only got a two-year suspended sentence. It is worth remembering that
sentences reflect the convicted person's criminal record, and the "form" of
these men was awesome.

Computerised fraud on a gigantic scale has been a major focus of media panic
and large-scale exaggeration in the past. The criminal community, it seems,
was guilty of believing everything it read in the papers.

In a copyrighted story dated December 19th, Rex Nutting of TechWire reports
that the U.S. Justice Department is considering new rules to restrict access
of Federal Parolees to computers and the internet.

Restrictions being considered include "requiring parolees to keep a daily
record of their computer use, requiring parolees to agree to unannounced
inspections of their computers, banning the use of private or public
computer networks without prior permission and banning the possession or use
of data encryption programs."

Lawyers and law enforcement experts termed the new rules "silly" and
"unenforceable".  Regardless of these opinions, I attach a more sinister
meaning to this proposal.  The U.S. Justice Department is reinforcing a
prevalent government attitude that private citizens use the internet
primarily for criminal purposes.

For some reason, it is all right for large corporations or organizations to
surf the net, and also to use encryption to protect their data and financial
transactions.  But the Justice Department rules imply that private citizens
doing the same thing must have something to hide, or are searching for
illegal materials--bombs, pornography, electronic vandalism methods, etc.

To my knowledge, parolees are not required to report visits to their local
libraries, where much of the same information can also be found. Perhaps we
need laws that require that borderline institutions such as libraries not be
located in high-crime areas or near prisons...

It's no secret that PC hardware manufacturers modify machines continuously
without changing model numbers, thus making it very hard for end users to
maintain consistent configurations.  These changes are usually swapping one
model of peripheral for another or one brand of chip for another, and less
commonly changing board layouts.  These changes are done to reduce
manufacturing cost, improve reliability, and/or deal with parts
availability.

According to the December 1996 edition of Byte (pg 28), at least one large
PC vendor recently made an incompatible BIOS change without changing the
BIOS revision label displayed at boot time.  The problem was discovered
because one machine ran Windows NT, while an ostensibly identical machine
wouldn't.  The RISKS of poor configuration management, driven by the
industry drive for reduced cost and increased performance, claim another

This is about a "feature" in WinWord 6 that a colleague stumbled across. The
incident shows the full arrogance that MS products exhibit when dealing with
situations with ambiguous semantics.

The said colleagues job was to prepare monthly reports about estimated and
real work-power efforts regarding some projects work-packages. For the first
few months he wrote these reports using the WinWord installed on his
laptop. Recently he switched over to using the WinWord installed on a
central NT server using WinCenter to access it remotely from his Sun
workstation. As it is common practise with such recurring reports, he opened
the report from last month to change the figures and save it under a new
name.

Now the figures were listed in a table, and the sum of each column was
calculated via the "Table Formula Sum(above)" function. Before he started
changing the numbers, he accidentally pushed F9 ("Update Fields") while the
cursor happened to be in the sum field.

Can you imagine how big his surprise was when suddenly the column sum
CHANGED before his eyes? Remember, he didn't change anything! And WITHOUT
WARNING! And to add insult to injury, the sum was WRONG!

Avid MS "fans" surely know by now what was wrong: the LANGUAGE
settings of the two Windows versions differed! And thus the symbol for
the decimal point was `.' on the one machine and `,' on the other.

The arrogance? NO WARNING! And the sum function does not even just truncate
then numbers, no, it somehow interprets the comma or period as a list,
because summing "1,4" and "2,3" gives...  TADAH! "10"!!! (it used to give
"3,7" with the other language settings)

The RISK? I really wonder how many reports are out there with wrong numbers
because some poor dilbert-type employee typed it on his computer and her
boss printed it from another computer with different language
settings. Maybe even someone got degraded or fired "because s/he reported
the wrong numbers"!

Also, WinWord is the only editor I know where you open a file, close it
again and WinWord asks you if you want to save the changes!!

(Another example of built-in arrogance: I tried to import some ASCII-text
records into MS Access. Instead of asking about the format, Access silently
tried to interpret the text itself and finally reported "1746 errors
found"!)

So the final lesson learned is:

&gt;&gt;&gt; MS documents ARE NOT PORTABLE! &lt;&lt;

(And another example of non-portabililty: MS Project stores the
workdays-per-week number as a PER-USER setting, not per-project!  Exchange a
Project with a colleague and BINGO! Everything gets re-scheduled.)

There are surely lots of other examples, maybe others would like to share
their "experiences" too.

BTW, I am sure that some of these "features" are or will get fixed. But I am
also sure that nobody will receive a bugfix or upgrade for free, as it is
common practise with other software companies. Instead you will be prompted
to "upgrade to Windows97 and WinOffice2000 for a real cheap $999.99 now and
your problems will be solved". Sweet arrogance!

My feelings are best reflected by this signature found on the Net:
"Microsoft is not the ANSWER.
Microsoft is the QUESTION,
and the ANSWER is NO!"

&gt; Making Netscape's cookies file a symbolic link to /dev/null is also an
&gt; effective way to disable cookies under UNIX.

There's been a lot of talk recently about disabling Cookie logs in Netscape
- theres a simpler (undocumented?) way of doing this you might want to
mention in a future journal.

In the Netscape preferences file there is an option "ACCEPT_COOKIE" that
gets set to "0" if you want to always accept them, and "1" to prompt the
user for every new cookie.  Setting it to "2" doesn't prompt the user and in
fact disables cookies altogether.

I got e-mail from _many_ people pointing out:

o this bug in phf and other sample CGI programs that come with
the NCSA httpd distribution has been known since March 1996.

o it allows many other tricks in addition to grabbing the /etc/passwd
file.  If you have one of the buggy CGI programs installed, then
intruders can use it to do essentially anything that can be
done by whatever userid your httpd server runs under.

The degree of tact ranged from courteous to downright rude.  Some people
implied that I must be a grossly incompetent webmaster not to have fixed
this one months ago.  But this is an academic research facility, not the CIA
-- and even the CIA website did get cracked, though I don't know which hole
was exploited in their case!

I do try to keep up, but I am not a full-time security specialist; I do many
different things, and I'm usually behind on most of them.  After two weeks
wasted cleaning-up after the crackers, I am even farther behind than usual.

So, it seems to me that there are lessons to be learned from this episode on
several levels:

o I personally am more conscious of security issues than I was before
this attack.  I will spend more time keeping up with security alerts
that might affect my site, and I will add scanning my webserver log for
suspicious URLs to my list of things to check on a daily basis.  Of
course, this will mean less time for my real work, and this does anger
me.  Even a supposedly-harmless intrusion requires a responsible
administrator to spend untold hours checking for damage, looking for
backdoors and Trojan horses the intruders might have left behind, etc.,
etc.  The cracker left a note claiming we had nothing to worry about
because he didn't damage anything, but in fact he _did_ do a small
amount of damage without apparent malicious intent.  And he did a large
amount of damage to my confidence in the integrity of my systems!

o Steps are being taken on an institution-wide level here at Yale to
improve the channels for coordinating responses to things like this.
When the wizards began checking other Yale servers for this hole, they
discovered that our servers in the Medical school are not the only
recent victims of phf attacks.

o Perhaps the Internet-wide channels for propagating alerts need to be
refined.  I believe part of the reason I missed this hole was the sheer
number of alerts coming from various quarters that I and other
overworked system administrators are expected to read.  It is simply not
reasonable to expect that every system administrator will apply every
recommended security patch every time yet another patch is released!
There needs to exist a mechanism for prioritizing warnings according to
the ratio of severity to ease-of-exploiting each threat.  The phf hole
is so nasty precisely because anyone who is reasonably familiar with
Unix can learn to exploit it in a matter of minutes.  And many crackers
are exploiting this one right now.

I use software that sends pages by dialing my modem and communicating
directly with the paging company's paging terminals.  I was using
first-generation software that didn't understand area codes, so I had to
enter the full dial string, 1-408-xxx-xxxx of the paging terminal.  It
worked fine.

Then I downloaded a new version of the software, which is much more
"intelligent" about area codes and dialing.  It now expects the user to
enter numbers without the leading 1, such as 408-xxx-xxxx.  (I didn't know
this.)  If the number matches your area code, it strips the area code.
Otherwise, it adds a 1 before the number.  The new software also defaults to
a PBX configuration in which you have to dial 9 to get an outside line.  (I
didn't know this.)

I tried my first page.  The software compared my area code (415) with the
prefix of the number it was to dial (1-408-xxx-xxxx).  It found that 415
does not match 140, and therefore prepended a leading 1.  It also prepended
a 9 to get an outside line.  The software then dialed

9-1-1-408-xxx-xxxx

The police showed up about 5 minutes later.  They confirmed my phone number
and asked why I didn't answer their return call.  I replied that it is my
modem number, and I thought somebody was sending me a fax.

I have reported this problem to the software manufacturer, and I assume
they will address the problem.  In their case, upgrades to their software
lead directly to the problem I described.  (The tech support person replied
that my description probably explains "something else that was happening.")

Bad design aside, a simple practice should be observed whenever software
dials the phone: the software should have a sanity check to make sure that
911 isn't being dialed.  For that matter, wouldn't it make sense for modem
manufacturers to include such a sanity check in their modem firmware?  Are
there legitimate reasons for a modem to dial 911?

Well, Timothy gives us another example of ghost phone calls.  Long-time
RISKS readers will recall

* <A HREF="/Risks/2.27.html">RISKS-2.27</A>: Ghost phone calls to 911 from cordless phone interference
when batteries ran down

* <A HREF="/Risks/16.88.html">RISKS-16.88</A>: Calling Number ID ghost calls (from preprogrammed demo
model?)

In response to my BART ghost-train item in <A HREF="/Risks/18.70.html">RISKS-18.70</A>, a RISKS reader asks,
WHAT IS A GHOST TRAIN?  Answer: A train that isn't there but that the
computer believes IS there.  Here are a few from the RISKS archives:

* SF Muni Metro: Ghost Train recurs, forcing manual operation
* SF Muni Metro: Ghost Train reappears; BART problems same day
* Chunnel has ghost trains, emergency stops (due to salt water?)
* `TCAS Sees Ghosts' (see IEEE SPECTRUM, August 1991, p.58)
* Chicago's O'Hare Airport radar lost planes, created ghosts

It all ghost to show, especially if you are in the show.

By permitting individuals to publish information about themselves and their
activities, the Internet has become a powerful tool for creating new social
connections across the barriers of geography and background. Recently,
though, several firms have started abusing the power of the Internet to
publish large databases of personal information without permission.  This is
impolite, and it many cases it can even be dangerous.

True story: recently, I followed a lead from MacUser magazine to a web page
for dealing with spam e-mailers. That page suggested that one of the first
steps to take was to contact services that track people's e-mail
addresses. With growing horror, I connected to page after page on the list
and located myself in their databases. Some services listed far more than
just name and e-mail address. My home address and phone number were
accessible from the same record. Two services even had a facility to show a
map of my neighborhood and the location of my house in it.

The widespread dispersal of information of this sort, without prior consent,
is a serious invasion of privacy. In some cases, publishing personal
information can be harmful to the individual.  For example, battered women
have very good reasons to keep present addresses confidential. Because these
services gather their data silently, from many sources, they present a real
threat to those who require anonymity. In addition, public databases serve
as a source for stalkers, scam artists, and junk mailers. Because they
potentially support these activities, databases of personal information
weaken the social environment of all people on the net inhabit.

Below I have listed the URL's for the pages, along with the information that
they contain and the contact address for that site.  Send mail to the
contact address, requesting that they 1) remove you from their database and
2) refrain from including you in the future.  Note, the mail you send must
contain enough information for the services to know which record to delete.
It's best to send the information that the service tracks. Also, be aware
that, unfortunately, there is no legal obligation for the companies to
remove your name.

Some time ago I came across a security vulnerability in the access
protection code in CERN httpd. I reported it to CERN last February but I
haven't received any reply and the bug is still in the current sources. The
bug is interesting because because it highlights a general risk which may be
present in other Internet software.

CERN accepts access protection as either IP address patterns (such as
192.14.203.*) or as DNS hostname patterns (*.softway.com.au). Because
the two share a similar syntax it uses the same code to the
comparisons. However, it's entirely possible to construct DNS names
that look like IP addresses and match the access protection rules.
(I did a quick survey and the only other net software I could find which
has the same problem is INN).

The bottom line is that if you run a the CERN httpd server as a proxy on a
gateway machine and you use IP address patterns to restrict access to the
proxy, external attackers can use the proxied services to access internal
machines. This vulnerability exists even if your site filters out IP source
address spoofed packets and has a paranoid resolver library.

I can supply a rough patch to interested parties; please contact me if you
would be prepared to test it. Otherwise, a patch will be available from
<A HREF="http://softway.com.au/misc/cern.html">http://softway.com.au/misc/cern.html</A> in the next few days. In the meanwhile, if
you are currently using CERN as a proxy on a gateway machine, I would highly
recommend using router or host OS IP filtering to restrict access to the proxy
service. Additionally you may want to look at newer proxy software, such as
Squid, which may or may not be more secure (I haven't looked).

Robert J. Perillo writes of a school that hired a teenager to break in, and
points (properly) to the need for key recovery mechanisms for encryption
systems.  There is, of course, a risk when a backup system is created.

The principal and former vice principal were on vacation.  (Shouldn't the
passwords have been changed?)  Another employee had a stroke.  So, who
present should have been able to authorize emergency key release if the
files had been encrypted?  The recovery system probably should have a wide
notification feature, to help detect misuse, but whom to notify, and would
they understand the messages they receive?

Of course, this problem is as old as bank vaults, where the security
interest requires that only one person know the combination but other
interests require that in the event of his death the vault can still be
opened by non-destructive means.

I think that a review of the market will demonstrate that "modern security
and cryptography" meet this requirement where it exists.  The reader who
thinks otherwise should compare PGP, intended for personal use, to PGP
Business Edition.

The former does not include any emergency key recovery while the latter
does.  Because of my profession, my age, and my failing memory, I choose to
use the latter and its features.  For the same reason, I choose to use RSA
Secure which not only makes my file encryption automatic but also provides
emergency key-recovery features.

It should be pointed out that these features (unlike proposals by the
Clinton administration) provide me with arbitrarily strong protection
against abuse by the trustees.  They permit me to name an arbitrary number
of trustees and require an arbitrary number of them to cooperate to recover
the key that I have used.  The higher the number that I name, the lower the
probability that they will be unavailable when needed.  The more of them
that I require to participate in the recovery, the lower the probability
that the requisite number will behave inappropriately.

Two examples may help.  For the protection of my file system, I have named
two trustees.  Since I carry my file system with me, sleep with it under my
pillow, and am more concerned about the behavior of my memory than the
ethics of my colleagues, either of them acting unilaterally can recover my
key.

It should also be pointed out that I do not use these techniques for those
keys that I use only for communication security.  They are restricted to
those that I use for file encryption.  If I should forget the passphrase
used to protect my communication private key, the appropriate remedy is to
revoke the old public key, generate a new key pair and publish the new
public key.  If there are messages that I received but cannot read, they
must be resent.

Note that using emergency key recovery for communication keys is not secure
and may compromise my correspondents.  It is at best rude and may violate my
obligations to them.

Consider by contrast the master key for a major credit card company.  This
key was generated under rigourous conditions inside a hardware box called
the BBN Safekeyper.  It is a property of this box that it resists all
attempts to remove the private key from the box.  Beneficial use of the
private key requires possession of the box and all three of the physical
keys that fit the three locks on the box.

Since the box is subject to physical destruction and since loss of use of
the key would be disruptive, not to say destructive, the box published five
numbers such that another Safekeyper box could reconstruct the private key
from any three of the numbers.  Thus, any three of the trustees could
prevent the recovery.  Of course, the values five and three are arbitrary
but they are also illustrative.  If 3 out of 5 works for this very sensitive
application, it is difficult to imagine an application for which a larger
number of trustees are required.

A security professional cannot recommend that important keys be stored in
any other way.  While I may consent to other arrangements, I recommend that
important (usually master) keys be stored in hardware dedicated to that
purpose with 3 out of 5 emergency key reconstruction.

Modern key management enables us to meet all of the security requirements
and without creating new problems of their own.  Any suggestion to the
contrary is, at best misleading.

There appears to be an active campaign on the part of the government to
pretend that these techniques do not exist and need to be invented.  There
is also a pretense on their part that the same remedies are necessary and
appropriate for communications applications as for file applications.  As I
have attempted to show, the remedies for one are inappropriate and insecure
for the other.  Because the government insists upon pretending to an untruth
where they must be presumed to know the truth, we should seriously question
their motives.

Roland Giersig's remarks reminded (<A HREF="/Risks/18.70.html">RISKS-18.70</A>) me of a whole spectrum of
issues that arise when one user creates a document and another user *on
another computer* tries to edit it.  Frequently, a significant portion of
the document's state or structure are contained in various preference,
configuration, and initialization files, or in the state of the system
itself (what fonts are installed, what printer is selected, etc), and
surprising transformations occur when the document is transplanted into a
different user's computer.

The war story: the urgent proposal had to go out immediately; X, who
prepared it, was out; Y was frantic because when she opened the fifty-page
proposal on her system, everything that should be in boldface was plain, and
everything that should be plain was bold.

What had happened was that, in some mysterious manner, X's NORMAL.DOT
default style sheet had somehow gotten into a state where the normal style
had the bold attribute.  X had vaguely wondered for months why her word
processor "always comes up in bold," but she just typed CTRL-B and went
merrily onward.  The "bold" attribute applied to text is exclusive-ored with
the bold attribute from the style sheet, so everything seemed normal; when
she thought she was applying bold, she was really removing it from the text
(and allowing the style sheet "bold" to take effect), and vice versa.  So
all documents created by X had bold and plain swapped when viewed or printed
on anyone else's computer.

Once upon a time I read an article by one Gerry Weinberg, who might have
been the same Gerry Weinberg who wrote the excellent book `The Psychology of
Computer Programming.'  In the article, he said that he was running a
company that wrote applications software for other companies, and that his
standard practice was for all programs he delivered to have a stipulated
lifetime of five years unless there was an explicit agreement otherwise.

The client agreed that at the end of the program's lifetime, either the
client would pay to have the program refurbished or all copies would be
destroyed.

As one of many engineers in the Safety Critical Systems Arena I have seen such
specifications. The normal lifetime expectancy for equipment (in harsh
environments) is thirty years. After this time the equipment may need to be
refurbished and continue another twenty years.

Such extended lifetimes do cause some problems, especially in trying to source
components that can last that long (large capacitors are especially difficult).
For this reason (among many others) many systems for such extended life
embedded applications are becoming networked solutions. By networking,
replacement sub-units can be installed that take advantage of the newer
components available but able to work together with older technology units.
This approach, of course, raises a whole set of new risk elements.

Actually, the computer industry has (up til now) been surprisingly good at
keeping model information/configurations consistent.  The auto industry, on
the other hand, has a dreadful record along these lines.  Any car buff knows
that auto manufacturers put whatever they had on hand into their cars, and
the model number itself is merely one of many clues with which to start your
search for the proper replacement part.  Depending upon whose stuff arrived
that morning, who was on strike that day, the phase of the moon, etc., you
may get one of 3-5 different vendor's parts.  I've even seen different
vendor's parts on different sides of the same car!  What's worse: the
bracket may be different for each vendor's part, so that nominally
interchangeable parts require sheet-metal work because the bolt patterns are
different.

The worst example I've seen so far in ensuring consistency is Toshiba
laptops, where each model number has a different BIOS, _and you aren't
allowed to upgrade the disk to a larger disk_ (even it it is a Toshiba
disk), because the BIOS won't recognize that size disk.  The only way I
could get the larger disk to work was to use Norton DiskEdit to set up the
volume info to include one volume that the Toshiba BIOS liked, and made sure
that that volume was the boot volume.  The Toshiba employees who thought up
this scheme should be rounded up and shot by the Dilbert patrol.

This past summer I was getting increasingly frustrated by users who were
sending me e-mail with Microsoft Word ".DOC" files attached to them via MIME
encodings.  I do not own a copy of Microsoft Word and did not want to
purchase one simply so that I could read documents people send to me.
Instead, I wanted the specification for Microsoft Word file format so that I
would have a Rosetta stone for the documents I wished to read.

I contacted Microsoft's customer support and was informed of the following:

1. The specification for Microsoft Word file format is unpublished
proprietary information.  However, I could download a free reader
for Microsoft Word files which would run under one of Microsoft's
operating systems.  Source code for the reader was not available.

2. I could ask the sender of the message to send me the attachment encoded
in Rich Text Format which is the official export format for Microsoft
Word documents.  The specification for Rich Text Format was publically
available from Microsoft.

Since I did not own a computer running one of Microsoft's operating systems,
I asked Microsoft for the specification for Rich Text Format files.  As a
computer programmer, this was also a more useful and interesting form of
Rosetta stone than a precompiled translating program.

I was then directed to the file GC0165.EXE on the Microsoft ftp site, which
I was able to download and unzip.  (Itself another decoding adventure.)
Included was the file GC0165.DOC, a Microsoft Word format file containing
the specification I desired.  The included README.TXT file contained the
following comment in plain ASCII:

The GC0165.DOC file included in this compressed file is the Rich Text
Format (RTF) Specification version 1.3.  The document is in Word 6.0 for
Windows format. If you have neither Word 6.0 for Windows nor Word 2.0 for
Windows with the 6.0-to-2.0 converter, you will need to call Microsoft
Product Support Services at (206) 462-9673 to obtain a hard copy of the
document.

At this point, I decided it was fastest to have my friend who owned
Microsoft Word print out the RTF specification for me.

Since this experience, I usually ask people who wish to send me Word
documents to send them in RTF format.  When I explain to people the RISKS
involved in using documents without open standards, I get comments about
being ridiculous and pedantic or perhaps a blink and a "So what?"  Even
though Microsoft Word supports an "official export format", it is clearly
not obvious to everyone why it should be used.

My personal experiences have shown that Micro$loth software has some very
severe compatibility problems.. - they are not even compatible with themselves.

Case in point: I recently designed lighting for a dance show, as part of the
process, I needed to create a cue sheet for the stage manager to work from
during the rehearsal process. Despite my extreme dislike for Micro$loth in
general, I decided that MS Excel for the Mac was the appropriate program to
use.  I proceeded to input my data for the first act, and saved a copy on
the desktop. I continued to input data, and saved a new copy (as a different
name) on the desktop, as well as a copy to the CAP server on the nearby Sun
workstation. I also printed 2 copies before closing the file.  At this
point, I had 2 printed copies, and (I thought) 2 online copies, on 2
different servers. I then grabbed a floppy disk, and went to copy the file
to it so that I could work on it at the theatre the next day. However, when
I went to grab the copy on the desktop (which had been saved not once, but
two times!), I found that it did not exist, however the copy from the first
act was there (with it's data intact, for the first act only). I then tried
the copy stored on the CAP server, only to find that Excel would not open it
as a Excel file, no matter how hard I tried.

I think the risks are obvious.

Another time, I was taking a class at a local community college, as part of
the class, we were required to use Word for Windows (unknown version - this
was several years ago, and my memory is a bit fuzzy). On several occasions,
a file would get saved on a floppy disk, only to find that the file could
not be opened by Word for Windows on any machine in the cluster, including
the one that it had been created on.  (This is typical of my experiences
with Micro$loth products in general)

As it turned out, I had almost as much knowledge about DOS/Windows as the
instructor, and I try very hard to avoid DOS/Windows like the plague.  My
purpose for taking the class, was to brush up my knowledge of DOS, against
the increasing possibility that I would be asked to provide some support for
DOS/Windows users (in spite of my hatred of DOS/Windows).  As it turned out,
the class did not go into DOS at all, instead concentrating on Windows
applications, and not at all on the internals of the system itself. The
class seems oriented towards future secretarys, and not towards users who
wish to learn about how a computer system works.  This was in spite of the
course description, which implied that the class would be a general purpose
introduction to the IBM PC.

The Risks? our society is rapidly turning out "trained computer users",
who have no idea how the machine works, or even how to restart Windows
from a DOS prompt.

With all due respect, I don't see how bugs in Microsoft products have
anything to do with Microsoft's "arrogance."

I realize that a large segment of the computer-science community likes to
bash Microsoft at every opportunity.  A good deal of that bashing may even
be deserved.  But it is hardly productive or responsible to take every
single bug in a Microsoft product as proof that Microsoft is Evil.  All that
accomplishes is to evoke the "boy who cried wolf syndrome," thus causing
real, legitimate complaints about Microsoft to be taken less seriously.

The last sentence of your message was rather indicative, I think.  "Sorry if
this sounds very emotional, but I have already wasted enough precious time
with things like these."  Yes, your message did "sound very emotional" -- in
my opinion, inappropriately so.  I'd like to think that the RISKS Digest is
above petty anti-Microsoft grand-standing.

As a cost-saving measure, the justice system of the province of Ontario,
Canada, has created a two-phase plan to file legal documents online rather
than on paper as at present.  The first phase covers civil courts; the
second, criminal courts, police and correctional services.  Documents to be
submitted electronically in the first phase include various notices and
statements of claim and defense, as well as court decisions.

The usual RISKS of relying on an electronic medium for important documents
apply, with a twist.  The proposed plan limits the accessibility of the
documents: under the current system, they are generally accessibly, but
under the proposed plan, the lawyers involved with the case will decide
whether or not to release them.  This includes the statements of claim,
explaining why someone is suing, and defense, the response from the person
being sued.

The Canadian Press item I am using as a source quotes prominent Toronto
lawyer Julian Falconer as saying, "a hallmark of a democratic process is the
openness of the adjudicative process....  It is wrong and unseemly to put
litigants and their counsel in the position of being gatekeepers of
information."  I am inclined to agree.

I was just reading a Transportation Safety Board of Canada report on a
runway overrun incident in 1995 at Vancouver International Airport.  The
airport is on an island just barely above sea level; presumably, then, when
a high pressure cell is in the area, its "pressure altitude" is below sea
level.

&gt;From the report (<A HREF="http://bst-tsb.gc.ca/air/ea95h0015.html">http://bst-tsb.gc.ca/air/ea95h0015.html</A>):

1.16.7 Take-off Performance Below Sea Level Calculations

During the review of the take-off performance calculations for the
flight, it was noted that the TPS incorrectly calculated the effect of
below-sea-level pressures on engine performance. The manufacturer
confirmed that the engine thrust curves indicated less thrust output
for operations at below-sea-level pressure altitudes; whereas the TPS
program calculated that performance increased as pressure altitude
decreased below sea level.

The CAI DC-10 FCOM and the OD43J Performance Manual also do not
incorporate a performance-reduction correction for operations at
below-sea-level pressure altitudes.

(TPS is the Takeoff Performance System computer, and FCOM is Flight Crew
Operating Manual.  CAI is Canadian Airlines International.)

This past summer in <A HREF="/Risks/18.28.html">Risks-18.28</A>, Michael Crawford reforwarded us an item
beginning as follows:

| "For several months, our nurses have been baffled to find a dead patient in
| the same bed every Friday morning" a spokeswoman for the Pelonomi Hospital
| (Free State, South Africa) told reporters.

Michael didn't know if it was true, but he thought it sounded plausible.  In
the following issue, Prabhakar Ragde and Geoff Kuenning suggested that it
sounded more like an urban legend, though a citation was given for its
appearance in the Cape Times, a respected South African paper.

The following Web page:

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.legends.org.za/arthur/cleanfaq.htm">http://www.legends.org.za/arthur/cleanfaq.htm</A>&gt;

debunks the story thoroughly.  It is indeed merely an urban legend.

Basically, it was circulating as a local rumor, and someone decided that it
had better be investigated, since rumors are, after all, *sometimes* based
on truth.  The fact of the investigation then led to the story reaching the
press and the Internet, and along the way the fact that it was *only* an
investigation was lost.

Arthur Goldstuck, author of the Web page, provides not only successive
versions of the story in Afrikaans and English, but also discussion with the
newspaper staff involved.  Recommended reading if you like that sort of
thing.

A friend forwarded this...  It was sent to his system's `news' account...  I
think there are many risks.  One is that you have a support staff that
doesn't know why it would be bad, and sends him your site's root password
via e-mail.  Another is that this makes for a great spam scam for dishonest
hackers...  Another is that even if they are legitimate, it is a risk having
passwords to many machines on the Internet in one location (prime target for
dishonest hackers).  I am sure I missed many risks as well.  Oh, yeah, the
risk on Clarinet having such an idea, and having them think it is a good

Dear Administrator:

You are listed in my records as ClariNet's technical contact at your site.
Our supplier contracts, the need for copyright protection and other
obligations require us to audit all sites and obtain confirmation of feed
data for our records on a periodic basis.

We have developed a two-step plan for implementing this audit, and we need
your help to make this plan work.

As a first step, I have sent you a questionnaire to complete and e-mail back
to me.  This should not take more than a couple of minutes, as it is simply
a listing of your newsserver information and data about sites to which you
feed the e.News.

The second part will involve remotely checking your news-server from our
site, thus we will need a login account and password.

Many organizations have switched from Private Data Networks to Carrier based
data communications services, such as the AT&amp;T frame-relay service. To take
advantage of the benefits of not buying, managing, and maintaining their own
systems. Yet the automated billings for these services have had many
errors. In a July user group meeting, user's talked of three years of bills
with constant errors, and of monthly bills being off by as much as $1,000 to
$2,000.

Originally, AT&amp;T stated that the bills were correct, and the problem was
that users were being fed inaccurate network loading and performance
data. Users were using this incorrect data to track and double check the
bills. In July, AT&amp;T Corp. confirmed that flawed software in the StrataCom
IPX network switches have provided users with inaccurate performance
data. The software in the StrataCom (now acquired by Cisco) switches, that
supports the Customer Network Management Services (CNMS), was said to have
bugs and flawed algorithms.

AT&amp;T sent a letter during the summer to all user's alerting them of the
problem and warned them not to calculate usage, performance, or capacity
using this corrupted data. AT&amp;T stated that they became aware of the
problems with the switch software in early 1996, and that they would be
fixing the problem with either corrective software or by upgrading to
StrataCom BPX switches by the end of 1996.

AT&amp;T then admitted that their own billing process, an automated billing
system in its new frame-relay network, was creating "billing blunders". AT&amp;T
blamed human error, and system integration problems. It seems that salesman
were unable to enter contracted discounts into the automated system, and
that facilities unrelated to the company's frame-relay service were being
included by the automated billing system essentially double billing.

Some user's stated that "the scary part is that these software anomalies
somehow slipped through testing by StrataCom and AT&amp;T, that shows that their
system is not foolproof, and that is more of a concern then the corrupted
data". Also, "If bills are incorrect, the service is perceived by users as
being less trustworthy".

I have noticed that Performance Monitoring (PM) software is usually left
to late in the development process, staffed by the less experienced or less
productive engineers of the development team.  Yet PM software can be tricky
to develop, because you are trying to devise algorithms to measure a system
that is still undergoing development and not completely defined. Also, it is
very difficult to specify performance, how you measure it, and to not
degrade performance by measuring it. It is difficult to test, because of the
varying conditions and loads.

It is reasonable that the designers, concerned about the mission critical
portions of the system, would concentrate their scarce resources in those
area's. When I have brought these concerns up in team meetings, I have been
told by project managers that we must focus on getting the system working
first and that we can worry about meeting PM requirements "sometime down the
road".

This attitude seems to create the Risks mentioned above, PM software
should not be the stepchild of the development effort.  Because the first
version of the PM software is usually incomplete and has bugs, it does not
show complete system performance correctly.  There have been projects that I
have been on which have been out in the field for years, when we finally get
the PM software working, we notice that the system has never been performing
properly.  Properly functioning PM systems can uncover flaws in the mission
critical portions of the software and system.

Re: Internet Docs and the RTF spec/M$Word recursion:

I ran into exactly the same recursion, but I took the more drastic/expensive
route of purchasing Mac M$Word 6.0.1c.  Although this helped somewhat, it
didn't completely solve the problem.

* Although the Mac/PC versions of M$Word are roughly the same (I think that
the bulk of this product is some kind of interpreted P-code) there are
important differences -- e.g., they don't have the same capabilities to
translate documents &amp; graphics.  Thus, if someone posts/e-mails a M$Word
document, you may be able to read the text, but the graphics may remain
untranslated/invisible.  Also, the PC versions of the fonts in the documents
prevail, so printing on your Mac takes forever because the generated
postscript includes separate commands _for each individual character
output_!  Oh, and BTW, the Mac version is unusable as a word processing
program due to its incredible slowness, so it is _only_ good for translating
documents and printing them.

* You should search a bit further.  There are sites with the latest RTF spec
in RTF format.  They also have the earlier versions of the RTF spec, so you
can see how it has changed.

* Having RTF won't necessarily help you.  Although RTF is supposedly an
'open' format, many of the features are supported only by M$Word, so you'll
_still_ need access to M$Word to read the document.  Although there is
supposed to be some level of backward compatibility, M$Word doesn't work
very hard at this, so the documents may still come out looking like a
disaster.

* The posting of documents in a proprietary/trade secret format _by
government agencies at all levels_ should be illegal.  Although M$ provides
a free Word reader for the PC, they provide no such reader for the Mac (or
Un*x).  The posting of court decisions in the proprietary wordperfect format
is also a major irritant.  If people can't easily read the document, then
the agency has not made the document accessible.

* There are a number of 'conversion' programs available that supposedly
handle RTF, Word X.X, Wordperfect, etc., documents.  Some of them do a
better job on the graphics than do the M$ converters.  However, most seem to
do very poorly on the word-processing parts -- e.g., fonts, section
headings, indentations, etc.  So you may have to utilize an ascii editor to
disassemble the RTF into text and graphics, convert each separately, and
then put the mess together again.  This is possible for one or two
documents, but not something you want to do on a routine basis.

So far, html 1.0 &amp; .gif appear to be more easily transportable than any
particular word processing format, TeX excepted.  Sadly, html is no closer
to having a math capability than 3 years ago -- putting equations in gif's
is not resolution independent!

Postscript is quite transportable, but many PC (l)users don't have
Ghostscript or equivalent to print it on their HP-compatible printers.

PDF (Adobe) is quite transportable and there are good versions for the PC
and the Mac.  I commend the IRS for making their forms so readily available
on the Internet in this format.

This is not a particularly deep comment, but one way of getting portable
documents from Microsoft products is to install a Postscript driver under
Windows.  Choose this as the default printer and select the "print to file"
option when printing.

I have used technique to to publish Postscript documents on our Web site.
Anyone with a Postscript viewer (such as the excellent Ghostscript) or a
Postscript printer is then able to view the document regardless of the
computer or operating system they use.

Without defending Microsoft, I would have thought that "the final lesson
learned" should have been to read the manual.

It's easy to blame a software publisher when things go wrong with a program
because of a programming error. Unfortunately, it's just as easy to blame
the publisher when things go wrong through user ignorance. An increasing
number of "risks" reported here seem to fall into the category of "I was
driving my car at 120 mph when I hit a patch of ice and slammed into a tree,
and it's all Ford's fault."

By all means, criticize the publisher when there is an error in a
program; but accept personal responsibility for user errors.

I read Timothy L. Kay's problem with his paging software calling the
police. One of the real problems, I think, is that we don't really have a
national consensus about phone numbers, area codes, and country codes:

* Is my phone number 555-1212, 617-555-1212, or 1-617-555-1212?
* Should the phone system allow me to dial 1-617-555-1212 if I
am in area code 617?

I'm having this problem in spades right now in a cross-country trip that
I'm taking. Some cell phone areas that I drive through require that you
dial 1-617-555-1212. Others insist that you dial 617-555-1212. You can
imagine that this means that my stored phone numbers don't work half the
time, depending on which zone I'm in.

Frankly, I think that the ambiguity over area codes and the "1" is an
industry disgrace and its sure to cause billions of dollars in lost
productivity and lost time over the coming years. But I don't see any way
to resolve the problems. When I speak with phone companies about this
matter---I ask them "why don't you let people always dial 1+area code even
when you are in the area code"---they don't even have a clue what I'm
talking about.

I have an OP-ED piece that I wrote on a similar subject --- area code
splits -- and I will post it if there is interest.

Timothy has fallen into the trap of being US-centric.  "911" is the
emergency services telephone number in the US.  But in Australia, "911"
doesn't mean a thing - our equivalent is "000".  "911" would simply be the
first three digits of a normal local telephone number!  [AUSTEL policy may
preclude this, but not as far as I can see.  For reference, see
<A HREF="http://www.austel.gov.au/info/numbering/]">http://www.austel.gov.au/info/numbering/]</A>

Other countries use other things - a quick search of the New Zealand Telecom
WWW site revealed that they use "111".  I'm sure that there numerous other
variants. Now, unless modem manufacturers want to supply an appropriately
tailored setup for every country in the world (and they'd better make sure
they get it right!), then it's ridiculous for them to consider about
building in such checks.

Note that if "911" *was* the appropriate emergency services contact number,
to block modem calls to it would eliminate potential systems that might be
designed to watch over the elderly or infirm, and automatically contact
emergency services when appropriate, security systems that might do the
same, and so on.

So, no, it would not make sense to include a "911" sanity check; to do so is
arguably a RISK in its own right.

[I was thinking more of a context-sensitive parameter-programmable
advisory rather than a complete blockage.  I should have been much more
explicit.  However, the theme of Timothy Kay's US-centricism was noted by
quite a few others, including
Sebastian Delmont  &lt;<A HREF="mailto:sdelmont@planetaurbe.com">sdelmont@planetaurbe.com</A>&gt;
(in Venezuela, 91 is an area code).
Terje Mathisen &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Terje.Mathisen@hda.hydro.com">Terje.Mathisen@hda.hydro.com</A>&gt;
(in Norway, 911xxxxx is a mobile-phone number,
although 900MHz GSM phones will never work in the US anyway!)
Tim Kuehn &lt;<A HREF="mailto:timk@tdkcs.waterloo.on.ca">timk@tdkcs.waterloo.on.ca</A>&gt;
(in Canada, one must dial 1 even within an area code!)
Also,
"Andrew Marc Greene" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:amgreene@mit.edu">amgreene@mit.edu</A>&gt; noted that in the 617 area-code
in Massachusetts, some intra-617 calls require a preceding 1.  Etc.
The moral lesson is a familiar one in RISKS: Easy answers are risky.
Complex solutions are also risky.  On the other hand, even moderate
solutions are risky, as your immoderate moderator repeatedly points out.
So, join the RISKS club.  By the way, any automatic censorship technique
is likely to run afoul of similar difficulties!  PGN]

[... 112 spreading for emergencies ... 911 is prefix for a London university]

* Phone numbers change so quickly these days that any assumptions built into
software are likely to be invalid in a few years.

* Some address book applications use modems to dial telephone numbers for
voice calls.  No doubt there's one out there with an 'emergency' button, and
I wouldn't be too happy to discover that the modem had suppressed the number
as my house burnt down around me.

I'm sitting in front of my computer and have a heart attack.  I can't get to
the phone in the other room, so with my last ounce of strength I fire up my
modem software and type "atdt911".  When my house-mate arrives later that
day to discover my dead body and

atdt911

ERROR

on my screen, a law suit against the modem manufacturer would almost
certainly ensue.  One could even envision some sort of automatic system that
might require a modem to dial 911.

If there's one thing your post shows, it's that adding needless complexity
to a software system (a.k.a. making the software "smarter") often adds
confusion and can lead to Really Bad Things.

Two years ago I had a similar incident. I had received a set of operating
system upgrade disks for a home system, primarily intended to correct some
problems in some of the items bundled with it. The upgrade went smoothly and
shortly after I attempted to dial up my online service provider. I heard the
modem dialing, but rather than the full dialing sequence, a person quickly
came on the line and said, "Emergency 911." Yikes! The modem continued
sending digits for a second while I sat there totally confused. The
emergency operator did not wait very long before hanging up.

I then waited for a return call or the police to show up. Neither
occurred. Meanwhile, I checked my comm setup. Where before I had disabled
"9" for outside line access, it was now enabled. In addition, the prefix
"1174" (or some similar meaningless code beginning with "11") was specified
to disable call waiting. Thus the setup specified the full prefix "91174"
before the actual number; the switching system cut me over to the 911
operator as soon as the second 1 was sent.

Prior to the upgrade, I had been able to dial in with no problems.  Since I
had not changed the setup, I concluded that the upgrade had; most likely it
had overwritten or updated a configuration file, since the communications
software was part of the system bundle. I sent e-mail to the system tech
support folks notifying them of this, and they later responded with
something along the lines of "that couldn't happen".  Yeah, right.

I pondered the reason why the operator had hung up so quickly and there was
no confirmation from emergency service personnel regarding the call. While
it is possible that our local 911 system was not capable of supplying
calling number identification at the time, I would still expect the operator
to try harder to get a voice response from the caller. The only thing I
could come up with was that she had heard the modem continue to send digit
tones in fast sequence and figured it was a bad fax or modem setup
accidentally placing the call (for all I know, 911 operators have to deal
with this problem every day, considering the proliferation of automatic
dialing equipment and the nifty interactions between PBX and public system
feature escape codes). Still, that's one place where a little knowledge can
be dangerous. It could just as easily been someone in the throes of heart
attack or panic banging on the numbers after having managed to dial 911. On
the other hand, maybe they were so used to dealing with prank or misdialed
calls that they didn't bother if there was no immediate response.

Is the setting "2" or "not 1 or 0"?  What about the RISK of Netscape adding
option 2 = "don't accept cookies from strangers &amp; send password file", or
any other option you might not want to choose by default but already have
chosen by setting the option to "2"?

SIGH. Don't we get enough of these in the newsgroups? This is yet another
variation of the good-old Good Times hoax virus. Checkout
<A HREF="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/vinfodb.html">http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/vinfodb.html</A>. The 'P' section contains an
entry on this annoyance.

As a general warning to everyone out there - Please do NOT pass along
virus/trojan/etc warnings to ANYONE until you have discussed the matter
with your sysadmin. Your sysadmin will likely know if it's real or not, and
will be able to help you take proper preventive measures, and distribute
the warning properly.

I know you are trying to help by distributing this warning, but really, all
you are doing is WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME!

Thank you.

The newspaper called *China Consumers Daily* says that China plans to
increase its controls over the Internet, which already include the
requirement that all Internet users register with the police.  In its war
against pornography and "cultural rubbish," Chinese police detained more
than 47,000 people and seized 320,000 pornographic products in the first ten
months of 1996.  Chinese authorities use the term "cultural rubbish" to
include anything they consider unhealthy or politically suspect.  (*Atlanta

included ``Welcome to the Truth,'' above dripping blood and a pair of red

The "Week in Review" in *The New York Times*, 29 Dec 1996, led off with a
column by Michael Wines entitled "The Sky Is Falling: Three Cheers for
Chicken Little."  It will probably be of interest to most readers of RISKS.
I don't agree with all of it, but it is definitely thought-provoking.
I just excerpt the main points:

``'Time is running out,' ... Mr. Peterson is writing about the imminent
bankruptcy of Medicare.  No matter. It easily could have been global
warming, overpopulation, designer genes, nuclear terrorism, AIDS, the
national debt, Apple Computer, Democrats, Republicans, the two-party system,
wetlands, desertification, moral decline, moral zealots, killer asteroids
or, for that matter, software that does not recognize the year 2000...

``Alarmism is a national obsession... Are Americans getting too much of a bad
thing?  Of course they are.  But that begs the real question: why doesn't
the sky fall?  And that question is a tougher one.  Sure, plenty of alarms
are raised over threats that are, to put it kindly, overstated...
Maybe the sky doesn't fall because alarms work as the alarmists intended.
Maybe the apocalypse never fully arrives because the alarmists' wretched
excess frightens people into taking action...

``There's no way to know for sure.  The only evidence that an alarm works is
in its being proved false -- which may also be evidence that the alarm was
unnecessary to begin with..."

``'It would be intellectually satisfying to say the real impact is through
reasoned discourse,' [Paul Ehrlich] said.  'But in my view the real impact
isn't in reasoned discourse.  Media attention, press coverage and, if
necessary, alarmism at least set an agenda.  And that way you can have a
debate.'" ...

``Alarmists can be self-promoting pains, and they are often wrong.  So ignore
them.  How bad could life be on an Earth slow-cooking in a sauce of melted
icebergs, populated by genetic experiments gone wild and fated to an
eternity of Windows 95?"

I was rummaging around my old books recently and came upon the following
gem.  It is interesting to note that everything he says is still true today,
down to the things he suggests we need to do to make software safer.  And
this was 26 years ago.  When will we ever learn?

&gt;From _The Computer Revolution_, by Nigel Hawkes.  Copyright 1971 Thames and
Hudson, London.  Copied without permission.

HOW SAFE ARE COMPUTERS?  (pages 193-196)

Less often discussed but potentially more serious is the danger of
what I call computer-aided disasters.  Many computer experts,
particularly those in the software field, believe that these
represent a very serious danger.  Alex d'Agapeyeff, President of the
British Computer Society, has argued that the existing computer
systems have a reliability rather worse than that of the British
telephone service.  Other computer professionals have claimed that
up to 70% of the computer systems in operation in Britain are
unsuccessful.  [He doesn't define what he means here.-WH]  Although
this may be an exaggeration, we would be wise to recognize the
widening gap between what the computer salesmen claim and what the
systems engineers actually provide.  Large computer systems remain
something of an unknown quantity, and are quite capable of going
very seriously wrong.
Most of the time this does not matter, except to those directly
concerned.  It is naturally irritating when a computerized system
sends one an absurd bill, but it can usually be corrected without
too much trouble.  [And now, in 1996, even that is sometimes not
possible.-WH]  When computers are used to control jumbo jets,
chemical plants or nuclear power stations, the effects of a similar
failure might be catastrophic.  More dangerous still, some people
believe, are elaborate military systems, where relatively untried
weapons may be sent on their way to the target by relatively
untried software.  The kind of dangers that can arise even in civil
air-traffic control are epitomized by a story about Britain's new
computerized system, called Mediator.  As a first stage of
implementation, a computer was introduced which could not deal
easily with letters of the alphabet; instead it used flight numbers
to identify aircraft.  Soon after its introduction, three aircraft
were circling over Watford waiting for clearance to land at
Heathrow, and all three had the same flight number --- BEA flight
701, Air India flight 701 and Iberia flight 701.  Fortunately, a
human air-traffic controller noticed in time, before the computer
had time to give all three aircraft clearance to land at once.
What security can one have against computerized disasters?
Errors very rarely arise in the hardware of a modern computer.
Almost all are introduced by human error --- by carelessly written
programs, inaccurate input data or badly conceived systems design.
Greater emphasis on software development and improved input methods
would help, but alone are never likely to be enough.  The dangers we
really need to worry about are exactly the ones we cannot predict,
and therefore cannot easily guard against.  As a minimum, it seems
to me, we should insist on all major computer installations being
designed to `fail softly' by falling back to a degraded state of
operation rather than collapsing catastrophically.  In the case of
chemical plants, nuclear power stations, or medical intensive care
units, we should insist that the control function is so designed
that it can if necessary be taken over by a human operator in the
event of a computer breakdown.  Failing that, a completely
independent `stand-by' system, with its own power supply, should be
installed.  These may seem expensive safeguards, but they are cheap
compared with the possible costs of ignoring them.
Unfortunately, there are at the moment no agreed standard to
which computer systems are expected to conform.  The industry is
new, and growing fast, and nobody has yet taken the time to set up
proper disciplinary agencies.  Even when these are established, they
are unlikely to be wholly effective, if the experience of other
industries is any guide.  Most probably, a better safeguard would be
to `professionalize' the computer programmers by establishing
learned institutions like those set up in the nineteenth century by
the engineers.  The British Computer Society is, indeed, trying to
turn itself into such a body, although it still has a long way to go.

[And these topics have been discussed in the ACM Software Engineering
Notes now in volume 22, and RISKS for 11.5 years, ever since.
However, I do not recall this book being mentioned before.  PGN]

Too many are suggesting that new programs are all OK and its only the "old
mainframe stuff" that will have problems with "Year 2000".  Well, people are
still writing code with bugged date logic.  Jim Towler, Wellington, New
Zealand

Million-dollar glitch ("The Dominion" -- Wellington, New Zealand,
8 Jan 1997) via NZPA [New Zealand Press Assoc.]

A computer glitch at the Tiwai Pt [place in South Island of New Zealand]
aluminium smelter at midnight on New Year's Eve has left a repair bill of
more than $1 million [New Zealand Dollars].  Production in all the smelting
potlines ground to a halt at the stroke of midnight when the computers shut
down simultaneously and without warning.  New Zealand Aluminium Smelters'
general manager David Brewer said the failure was traced to a faulty
computer software programme, which failed to account for 1996 being a leap
year.  The computer was not programmed to handle the 366th day of the year,
he said.  "Each of the 660 process control computers hung up simultaneously
at midnight," Mr Brewer said.

The same problem occurred two hours later at Comalco's Bell Bay smelter, in
Tasmania [Australia].  New Zealand is two hours ahead of Tasmania.  Both
smelters use the same programme, which was written by Comalco computer
staff.

Mr Brewer said the cause was difficult to trace and it was not till a
telephone call in the morning from Bell Bay that the leap year link was
made.  "It was a complicated problem and it took quite some time to find out
just what caused it."

Tiwai staff rallied through the night to operate the potlines manually and
try to find the cause.  The glitch was fixed and normal production restored
by midafternoon.  However, by then, the damage has been done. Without the
computers to regulate temperatures inside the pot cells, five cells
over-heated and were damaged beyond repair.  Mr Brewer said they would have
to be replaced at a cost of more than $1 million.

[Reminder: I generally do *not* use a ``spellchecker'' for Britishisms
(including Kiwi-isms) such as aluminium vs aluminum, honour, etc.
But here we clearly needed a ``smeltchecker'' for our Smeltschmertz.  PGN]

BANKS FACE FINES OVER VISA CARD PROBLEMS, Fraser Nelson

Visa, the world's largest credit card company, is preparing to impose a fine
of up to UKP100,000 per month on some of its member banks in a last-ditch
attempt to ensure that they will accept credit cards with expiry dates
extending into the new millennium.

The company, itself a consortium of 20,000 banks, is launching the penal
system a year after its first deadline for Year 2000 compliance.  It
estimated that 1.3 million outlets worldwide are still unable to deal with
cards with expiry dates reading '00'. Britain is believed to account for
only 40,000 of the faulty terminals.

After April, banks that have problems processing Visa's cards will be
charged between UKP600 and UKP100,000 per month, depending on volume, until
they correct the bug.

Visa says that 90 per cent of terminals accept the new cards but an
unacceptably high number still throw up an error when told a card was issued
in '97 and expires in '00. Jim Dickie, vice president of Visa's operations
and services in Europe, said the move was the next logical step to safeguard
the credit card's brand name.

Year 2000 compliance is the first of three upheavals Visa faces over
the next three years. The cards are also to have built-in microchips,
and European monetary union will require further upgrades.

[My Visa card expires in March. I wonder if I'll encounter any of those
'only 40,000' terminals this year? Convincing shop assistants that my card
isn't stolen could be an interesting experience.  L.

The latest (Jan 1997) issue of "Mix" magazine (a pro-audio trade
publication), points out a potential risk in some new connectors recently
introduced for the audio industry.  Essentially, these are a set of adapters
that convert common audio connectors to the standard three prong A.C. power
configuration.  The idea is to allow ordinary power extension cords to be
used to carry audio in "emergency" situations at wiring performance venues
if the "correct" cable isn't available.

Mix properly notes serious concern over the obvious risks of such use,
especially in the hectic wiring situations where mislabeled cables are
common, and a technician thinking he or she was handling an audio cable
might find themselves plugged into A.C. mains current instead.

I noticed a UPS (United Parcel Service) TV commercial this weekend that
advertises the capability for one to download an image of the signature of
the person who signed for a package.  It seems like a matter of a few
minutes of hacking for a reasonably clever forger to gain the ability to
sign checks and credit card slips (particularly those you sign and mail in)
on behalf of anyone who signs for a UPS package.  Even if there is tight
network security so that only the package sender can see the signature,
nothing stops a would-be forger from UPS-ing a bogus package to the person
whose credit card or checkbook s/he stole.

To the extent that handwritten signatures are used as a security measure any
more (which is debatable, of course), publishing them in a computer-readable
medium seems to me like an unnecessary risk with little or no compensating
advantage.

&gt; The airport is on an island just barely above sea level; presumably, then,
&gt; when a high-pressure cell is in the area, its "pressure altitude" is below
&gt; sea level.

As amusing as it may seem, this shows the excellent design of being prepared
for an unlikely event - like flying below sea level. Unlikely, but not
impossible.

This reminds me of an unconfirmed report from many years ago about the first
military aircraft from China Lake/Edwards AFB that flew with an
altimeter-linked autopilot and tried to buzz the deck in Death Valley (280
feet below sea level). I've heard various stories about it 1) tried to land
in mid-air; 2) believed it was about to crash and attempted to eject the
pilot; 3) nearly flew into the Panamint mountains trying to avoid crashing
at 'sea level'.

Without further details, it is almost certain that the 'ghost train' is a
track circuit failure.

Track circuits are the fundamental building block of railway signaling
systems. Their purpose is to detect the presence of a train in a particular
section of track. Failure to detect a train is certain to eventually cause a
serious accident; the Clapham Junction accident in the UK, for example, was
caused by a wiring error which omitted a track circuit from the controls of
a signal.

All technology fails, of course, so track circuits are designed to indicate
the presence of a train when they fail. This is 'safe' as it holds signals
at danger and prevents any points in the track section from moving.

Totally locking up the system, however, would close the line until the track
circuit was repaired. So there is always a method of granting authority for
trains to pass a signal at danger and *slowly* pass over a track when a
track circuit fails -- the 'manual operation' mentioned above. The railways
have traded off a small amount of safety (a small number of collisions have
occurred when Drivers travel too fast under these circumstances) to prevent
total closure of the line.

The 'ghost train' in the tale is the result of a deliberate decision as to a
technology failure mode, careful design to bias potential failures into this
safe failure mode, and a careful trade off between safety and closure of the
line. Given the very low accident rate on railways equipped with track
circuits, the 'ghost train' is, in fact evidence of a Risk success, not a
failure!

Second International Workshop on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems
ERCIM - FMICS    CESENA (Italy)    4-5 July 1997     [truncated for RISKS]

The Second International Workshop on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical
Systems will take place in Cesena, close to Bologna (Italy) as a Satellite
Workshop to the 24th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and
Programming, ICALP '97.  Workshop page URL:
<A HREF="http://fdt.cnuce.cnr.it/~latella/FMICS/WS/Cesena97/workshop.html">http://fdt.cnuce.cnr.it/~latella/FMICS/WS/Cesena97/workshop.html</A>

The aim of these workshops is to provide a forum mainly for, but not limited
to, researchers of ERCIM Sites, interested in the development and use of
Formal Methods in the Industry.  In particular, these workshops should bring
together scientists active in the area of formal methods and willing to
exchange their experience in the industrial usage of these methods. They
also aim at promoting research and development for the improvement of formal
methods and tools with respect to their usage in/interest of industry.
Please notice that the workshop will be held in conjunction with the Second
International Workshop on Advanced Intelligent Networks (AIN'97)

SUBMISSIONS: Authors are invited to send five copies of a full paper (in
English, up to 25 pages) to the Programme Chair: S. Gnesi, CNR -
Ist. Elaborazione dell'Informazione Via S. Maria 46, I56126 Pisa - ITALY by
31 JAN 1997. An electronic version of the paper in .ps format plus an
abstract should also be sent to: <A HREF="mailto:fmics@iei.pi.cnr.it">fmics@iei.pi.cnr.it</A>

*The New York Times* reports today (10 Jan 1997) that Newt Gingrich was
overheard in a telephone conference call to other House bigwigs on 21 Dec
1996 plotting strategy on how to deal with his ethics problems and possible
attacks from opponents.  This despite his promise, made the same day to the
ethics subcommittee by his laywer, that he would not use his office or his
allies to orchestrate a counter-attack to the charges.

Big deal, you say?  Politics as usual, you say?

I agree, except for one hook... the call was intercepted by a Florida couple
on a scanner radio, most probably from the cell phone connection of one of
the participants.  No fans of Newt, the couple reportedly recorded the
conversation and passed it along to an anonymous Democratic Congressman, who
released it to *The Times*.

Some people never learn... and therein lie the RISKS...

David Salas, 34, worked last summer as a subcontractor on the development of
a computer system for the California Department of Information Technology.
He was fired after falling out with his business partner.  He has now been
arrested on three felony charges, for ``allegedly trying to destroy'' the
system.  He is suspected of having built a backdoor into the system so that
he could access it remotely.  [Source: *San Francisco Chronicle*, 9 Jan

Gears and relays of old-time mechanical computers have been known to
inadvertently engulf various foreign objects, but Cabbage Patch Snack Time
Kid dolls are designed to eat plastic food.  These dolls were reportedly
trying to ingest assorted children's hair and fingers during the recent
holiday season, incurring some minor scrapes and bruises.  [Source: *San
Francisco Chronicle*, 31 Dec 1995, A2.]  Mattel is offering $40 to anyone
who returns a doll, according to an item I heard on the radio.  Although
this risk has no direct computer-related connection, the absence of an
easily accessible off-switch does seems like a flaw in the design of the
human-doll interface.  On the other hand, the existence of a reverse-flow
switch would probably be a bad influence on the eating habits of small
children.

Always look a gift doll in the mouth, but don't look too closely.
The doll might have a ball, and it might be your (eye)ball.

Researchers at Princeton University have released a paper documenting ways
that nefarious crackers could dupe unwitting Web browsers into divulging
personal information, such as bank personal identification numbers or credit
card numbers.  One way to do this is to break into a legitimate Web server
and alter the links to other sites, so that when users click to transfer,
they're actually transported to the cracker's computer where the virtual
hijacker can watch every move they make (such as entering credit card info
when prompted).  The researchers suggest that Web surfers take the following
precautions: disabling JavaScript in their Web browsing software; keeping an
eye on the software's location line, to ensure they know where they are; and
paying close attention to the addresses they visit.  (*Chronicle of Higher
Education*, 10 Jan 1997, A25)

In the Finnish TV news on 9 Jan 1997, it was reported that the Finnish car
registry had sent mail to 11 thousand car-owners stating that the
registration of their cars would be dropped from the registry, "because the
car has been out of use". The registry representative said this was caused
by a "computer error" the exact cause of which is being investigated.  The
registry then sent out 11,000 apologie letters.

What if the program had silently marked the 11,000 registration records as
expired?

Today's front page of the *Wall Street Journal* hints of the apocalypse: ``A
technical problem on the Skytel paging network led to a nationwide bout of
beeper madness, as a digital deluge of erroneous call-me-back messages swept
over more than 100,000 unwitting pager customers.''

What happened was an erroneous broadcast at 8 AM EST to over 100,000 Skytel
pager customers, most of whom assumed it to be a local phone#.  Thousands
tried to return the call.  The incident was then compounded by some 36 users
who recognized the number for what it was, a PIN.  They dialed Skytel,
entered the PIN and their own phone numbers.  ``The Skytel system then
efficiently zapped those real phone numbers out: to the same 100,000 pager
customers.  Ever eager, thousands of them then returned calls to the
diligent three dozen'' who got 300 calls an hour or more, still 40 an hour in
the afternoon.

At one time or another, we've all been grateful to a helpful customer
service rep who has managed to overcome ``the system'' and correct some
problem plaguing us.  Evidently, that's exactly what a Skytel staffer was
trying to do for a customer who wanted her pager service activated.  But
somehow ``a terribly wrong PIN'' was assigned, one that was linked to to a
secret code Skytel uses to broadcast news to 100,000 users.  The network
computer saw the PIN was wrongly linked and rejected it, ``but the Skytel
staff successfully overcame the computers recalcitrance'' and then tested
the new customer's PIN by zapping the 7-digit number over the network so it
would show up on her display.  Scott Hamilton, Mtel (Skytels parent company)
spokesman: ``with any kind of computer system, from time to time, numbers
have to be jiggled, and they were attempting to jiggle.  It was just a
mistake.''

Who of us hasn't ``jiggled'' a computer or been profusely grateful to
someone who did it for us and solved some nasty problem.  One RISK is that
many people who have to work with computers "know" how dumb they really are
and have found end-around plays in order to get the job done.  But, of
course, sometimes the computer 'recalcitrance' is deliberate.

A Defense Department panel, in an unusually strident report, recommended $3
billion of additional spending over the next five years to improve the
security of the nation's telecommunications and computing infrastructure.
Warning of a possible ``electronic Pearl Harbor,'' the task force appointed
by the Defense Science Board also said the Pentagon should seek the legal
authority to launch counterattacks against computer hackers.  ``There is a
need for extraordinary action,'' the board's task force on ``Information
Warfare-Defense" stated in a report that was quietly released on Friday.
Current practices and assumptions, it said, "are ingredients in a recipe for
a national security disaster."  The report also predicts that by the year
2005, attacks on U.S. information systems by terrorist groups, organized
criminals and foreign espionage agencies are likely to be ``widespread.''

For RISKS participants struggling to convince their managers of the
possibility of information warfare level II (inter-corporate conflict via
information), here is a useful case.

Canada's _Globe and Mail_ 97.01.10 pA1:

Letter drive linked to Shoppers employee: Owner of Meditrust says he
believes campaign scared investors away from mail-order pharmacy.

By Jane Coutts and John Saunders, 	_The Globe and Mail_

A letter campaign attacking a mail-order pharmacy company has been traced to
a mailbox rented by the secretary of a vice-president of Shoppers Drug Mart.
The [C]$11-a-month box is home to the Society of Concerned Pharmacists,
whose listed address, Suite 142, 2671 Eglinton Ave.  E., is in fact Box 142
at Mail Boxes Etc., a private postal outlet.

Key points from the article:

* No evidence yet of the legitimate existence of the SCP.

* SCP accused of sending out 6,000 copies of a letter highly critical of the
mail-order pharmacy business proposed by Meditrust Healthcare Inc.

* Letter said SCP represented 6,000 pharmacists; now claimed to be
typographical error (should have been 600 but no proof of any members at
all).

* Letter written by Larry Rosen, independent pharmacist partly funded in the
past by Shoppers Drug Mart.  .  .

* ... but letter was signed by another person described as a practising
pharmacist -- of whom the College of Pharmacists of Ontario has no record
whatever.

* Letter may account for failure of initial public offering of shares.

* Private Investigator searched garbage of mail drop and found record
showing that secretary rented box.

This minor case demonstrates the risks of (1) breaching authenticity by
fraudulent misrepresentation; (2) the effects of breaches of integrity of
data in the real world, including especially the investment community; and
(3) the risks of breaches of confidentiality such as throwing out
confidential information in plain garbage.

Extensions of these lessons to purely electronic data are clear: verify
authenticity and integrity of data before acting on any information from
untrusted sources; obliterate data remnants.  MEK

Jack Kapica reports on cyberspace every Friday in _The Globe and Mail_.  He
points out today (Cyberia column, 97.01.10 p.A6) that despite the enthusiasm
expressed by the likes of _The Washington Post,_ _The Economist_ and _The
New Yorker_, AMAZON.COM does not, in fact, have more than 1,100,000 titles
in stock as claimed.  They actually have only 200 titles in stock in their

The new US crypto export regulations control the export of most if not all
data-security software. Regardless if the software uses cryptography or
not. Many software archives seem to be in violation of the new regs.

[Federal Register: December 30, 1996 (Volume 61, Number 251)]
[makes it illegal to export without a license:]

c.3. ``Software'' designed or modified to protect against malicious
computer damage, e.g., viruses;

[For the full text, see
<A HREF="http://www.epic.org/crypto/export_controls/interim_regs_12_96.html]">http://www.epic.org/crypto/export_controls/interim_regs_12_96.html]</A>

This certainly controls virus checkers, firewalls, and other security
software. There are substantial penalties involved in violating the EAR.
The US can assess daily penalties and block all exports of a company's
non-violating products. Criminal penalties apply as well.

"Export", as defined in the new regs, includes making software available on
the web or via ftp.

If you have a virus checker or similar software available for ftp inside
the US and the software can be downloaded from outside the US, you are most
likely in violation of the new EAR which took effect on 12/30/1996.

If you do not wish to go to prison, you may want to consult an attorney
immediately and remove all data security software from your server.

<ADDRESS>
&lt;[identity withheld by request]&gt;
</ADDRESS>
<I>Thu, 9 Jan 1997</I><PRE>

On Wednesday 8 Jan 1997, the entire US Coast Guard discovered that its
standard Spreadsheet no longer runs on Wednesdays (or Saturdays), and
refuses to print files on Tuesdays and Thursdays!  Mondays and Fridays are
OK, though.

The Coast Guard uses a proprietary Operating System called CTOS, marketed by
Unisys.  Although most of the software was specifically built for the CTOS
environment, some of it was ported over from other operating systems.  A
program called Ofis Spreadsheet is an amazing clone of Lotus 1-2-3 v2.2, for
example.

On the above date, everyone noticed that their spreadsheet program no longer
worked, giving what amounts to a Windows' General Protection Fault error at
start-up.  It turns out that the hexadecimal codes that CTOS uses to
represent the date added an extra digit with the new year.  Apparently, they
went from FFFFFFF to 10000000 at some point after New Year's Day.
Unfortunately, some of the non-native applications (the 1-2-3 clone and the
Progress db's seem to be the ones in question) can't handle this change
elegantly.

Interestingly, although no word has yet been spread on how to solve the
anecdotal Progress problems (of which I've seen no sign myself), the
solution to the spreadsheet conundrum is to change the date format.  Even
though the spreadsheet file may not access any date functions, the
application *does*, and it doesn't like MM/DD/YY formats from 1997 onwards.
But if you change the startup files to indicate a DD/MM/YY format, the
problem goes away...

RISKS: You may be concentrating on a problem (Y2K, which is a major effort
in the Coast Guard just now) that is not *quite* as timely as another that
is sneaking up on you.  Watch out! This sort of embarrassment just might
undermine your Y2K efforts.

Perhaps, from this time forward, it might be smart to run test systems with
clocks set a month or more ahead of schedule.  Just in case.  I know that I
will be.

BT recently merged with MCI to form Concert; will MCI be following suit? Is
the 18-week grace period long enough for previously complacent suppliers to
rectify their systems?  [*Electronic Telegraph*, City News, 9 January 1997]

[The 'red card' references are to a game called football, played
here in the UK, where a red card signifies that a player is sent off
the pitch for an offence such as kneecapping an opponent or beating
up a spectator. This game has nothing whatsoever to do with American
football or Australian-rules football, and is *not* called soccer.  L.]

BT IN 'RED CARD' ALERT TO SUPPLIERS OVER 2000
By Roland Gribben

BRITISH Telecom is warning suppliers that they will be shown the ``red
card'' and be sacked if they cannot produce evidence that they are working
to change their computer and information technology systems to cope with the
year 2000 date change.  The group has written to its 1,800 suppliers and
drawn up a green, amber and red coding system to detail the state of
preparedness.  ``Red'' suppliers are in danger of being removed from the
list of suppliers.

More than half BT's suppliers have yet to answer inquiries about the change,
according to the latest edition of Computer Weekly.  Milli Lewis, BT's year
2000 project manager, said: ``We are starting an escalation process which
will leading to BT not trading with suppliers after an 18-week warning.''
BT has already started planning for changes in its computer network and aims
to have everything in place by the end of next year, but along with other
major groups also deeply involved in the exercise, it is worried that other
companies down the supply chain will not be ready.

The telecommunications group is ready to step up the pressure on suppliers
it feels are failing to demonstrate they are taking the change seriously and
could start weeding out the laggards by March.  It has a team of managers
available to help companies tackle the problem.

&gt; Actually, it appears, you don't need to register in order to use that URL.

&gt; The correct URL for the web page is included above, everything to the
&gt; right of the question-mark in the URL above specifies that I'm reading
&gt; the article I would imagine.
&gt;
&gt; Hmm.  I suppose as a RISKS reader I might have checked this, but I did not.
&gt; A risk associated with passing URL's to other people, via e-mail?

Good question. Other people can now pretend to be you to the site, and
browse the site without registering, giving false reading preference
information to the site.

This is arguably good for web users as a whole, many of whom dislike having
their preferences tracked, but bad for the content provider and for the user
allocated the URL if the URL owner attempts to do customised profiling, page
output or secure transactions based on the supplied data.

The registration could be made more secure, with name and password required
each time for access instead of a bookmarkable identifier-in-URL - but many
sites have gone away from that model, since it discourages casual use.

Here in the UK, the Electronic Telegraph, which I'm more familiar with, uses
a similar identifier-in-cgi-for-state-machine URL.
&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/</A>&gt;

They've completely redone their identifier system, requiring that people
reregister, three times since going online in 1994, presumably due to
running out of allocation numbers (new URLs are considerably longer) and/or
wanting to purge 'old' users from their database.

I don't know what data is generated or how the ET plans to move to a payment
system for searching their archives, which have been on a 'free trial' basis
for the last couple of years.

Open, easily-subverted registration systems like these provide a risk to the
overall quality of the provider's tracking data and a risk to the individual
registered, but it's probably an acceptable risk to society as a whole, IMO,
since it's convenient and makes the content referrable.

For the user so inclined, it's a great way of increasing your privacy by
providing inaccurate data and fudging the data generated to track your
reading interest.

Anyway, when you registered the only true information you provided was a
valid e-mail address for automatic verification - right? The online
newspapers are starting from a mass of unverified information, and the
tracking information can't make it any better. Entropy goes one way, and (in
this case) I can't see the ET easily moving to a payments model for their
search engine any time soon.

Recently, there was a message posted in this forum of data collection
services and a list contacts to have yourself removed from them. I contacted
several of those services and was surprised by the response from
Bigfoot. Apparently, their database is one-way although I can subscribe to
their service and *modify* my profile.

&gt; Currently, we can not delete listings that have already been
&gt; entered in our database.  However, you may edit your profile to
&gt; become unlisted and therefore have no information visible to
&gt; anyone searching for you on our directory.  Just follow the
&gt; following steps to change your status:

I do not know how Bigfoot collected my e-mail addresses (they have collected
both past and present e-mail addresses) but spammers tend to collect
addresses by scanning the USENET. To battle the onslaught of spam I no
longer use a valid return address in my news postings. I wish that were not
necessary.

The risks? First, unknown to the people, companies collect information on
them and freely advertise it. Imagine the repercussions of battered women
hiding from their spouse.  Two, you may or may not have any rights regarding
the information about you they make available. Lastly, to protect ourselves
we are being forced into an anonymous society.

I was looking through the logs of our HTTP server and saw a large block of
accesses from widener.archive.org.  It looked like they were sequentially
downloading each page on our server, but I didn't recognize the address as
being one of usual search services.

I checked out their web site (www.archive.org) and it looks like they are
systematically making and storing copies of everything the can access over
the Internet.  Their pages talk about what a great research tool their
database will be for future 'net historians, but also says that it will be a
treasure-trove for marketers and entrepreneurs.

I didn't find a discussion of their position on the copyright issues their
project brings up, but I doubt that whole-scale copying of entire sites
without any human intervention or commentary is 'fair use', especially
considering the American Geophysical Union v. Texaco case (RISKS 16.68).  At
more than 1 TB of text and images copied off of the 'net (and 100GB more
each week), they could have the largest archive of violated copyrights in
the world.

Giving them the benefit of the doubt (that they aren't maliciously copying
other people's work for profit), a risk is that one's enthusiasm for a new
medium or technology can blind one to the existing legal guidelines that
apply to one's project.  I don't really have the interest or resources to
pursue an infringement suit, but I bet someone else (like an artist,
publisher, or software company) will, especially if the Internet Archive
starts allowing access to their data.

Another risk for people with Web pages is that every rant or embarrassing
picture that you publish on the Web (and later think better of and remove)
could now be accessed by future generations without your control.  It could
be argued that posting to Usenet implies a certain loss of rights to control
the fate of your message, given the nature of Usenet distribution.  I
wouldn't think the same is true for Web pages (but I have no qualifications
in IP law).

Willis Robinson, 22, of Libertytown, Maryland, was sentenced to 10 years in
prison (6 of which were suspended) for having reprogrammed his Taco Bell
drive-up-window cash register -- causing it to ring up each $2.99 item
internally as a 1-cent item, so that he could pocket $2.98 each time.  He
amassed $3600 before he was caught.  [AP item in the *San Francisco

On Saturday morning, 11 Jan 1997, AT&amp;T's Telstar 401 satellite, with a full
complement of both C and Ku band transponders, went dead.  Technicians have
been unable to reestablish any contact.  The satellite normally carries both
broadcast network and syndicated television programming.  The networks, as
"platinum" customers, were quickly switched to an alternative bird.  Almost
everyone else has been scrambling to find transponder space for their
programming.

The risk?  Don't assume the satellite will always be there!

This was reported locally in the *Sacramento Bee*, 8 Jan 1997, and is
being discussed extensively if informally hereabouts.  Unfortunately, the
twenty-column-inch long article is not stored at www.sacbee.com's archive
page online.

The accused saboteur was a subcontractor of a subcontractor of a contractor
of a state agency.  He spent at least six hours online before being
detected, and then crashed the system, which had to be restored from backup.
The newspaper article states damages as limited to $10,000, but that number
may be invalid.  Here in Sacramento the cost of a first-rate security
incident audit by an outside firm runs $20 to $30K, plus the cost of system
changes based on security weaknesses.

The nature of professional services procurement in government lends itself
to multiple levels of subcontracting.  Most computer technical experts do
not work independently, since that would require large insurance bonds and
skills writing responses to governmental requests for proposal.  Often
contracting and outsourcing firms bid for contracts, and only hire
contractors once the bid is rewarded, so there is constant staffing churn.

The RISK here is starkly stated in the article, in the last few paragraphs,
where the opinions of the management team are given: "Department officials
claim they did not know Salas was fired because he was a subcontractor and
they had no direct dealings with him.  John Thomas Flynn, who heads the
department, said his staff did everything 'by the book'.... Flynn said, 'We
didn't drop our guard.'  Since the intrusion, computer security has been
improved.  But even without the extra precautions, it is unlikely that such
an intrusion will ever occur again, department officials said."

Isn't it the job of management to know and manage the chain of control?
Even if a department employee were tasked with managing all the contractors,
there is a big difference between knowing a contractor is working between 8
&amp; 5 and knowing exactly what that person is doing and creating.  Traditional
management practice does not require or expect technical knowledge.  That
means security, reliability, auditability are dependent on the integrity of
the technical workforce, not on the management and quality control
processes.

The idea that it cannot happen again is naive; the statement itself is an
attractive nuisance.  No system is static in this day and age.  The next DNS
server or Internet firewall that is installed will create a situation
wherein this may happen again, since it appears, from what has been stated
in public, management has learned little from the event.

Electronic Roach Implants Probed, By ERIC TALMADGE
Courtesy of Associated Press via America Online's News Profiles:

A big brown cockroach crawls across the table in the laboratory of Japan's
most prestigious university.  The researcher eyes it nervously, but he
doesn't go for the bug spray. He grabs the remote.  This is no ordinary
under-the-refrigerator-type bug.  This roach has been surgically implanted
with a micro-robotic backpack that allows researchers to control its
movements.  This is Robo-roach.  ...

[With a $5 million dollar grant from the Japanese Government -- no
Proxmires in the Diet obviously]

Professor Isao Shimoyama, head of the bio-robot research team at Tokyo
University says, electronically controlled insects carrying mini-cameras or
other sensory devices could be used for a variety of sensitive missions --
like crawling through earthquake rubble to search for victims, or slipping
under doors on espionage surveillance.  ...

The controls, however, still have a few serious bugs of their own.
Swiss researcher Raphael Holzer, part of the Tokyo University team
Holzer jolts a roach with an electric pulse to make it move slightly to the
right and keep to an inch-wide path.  Instead, the roach races off the edge
of a table into Holzer's outstretched hands.
``The placement of the electrodes is still very inexact,'' he admits,
setting the bug back on track.  ...

Holzer is optimistic. ``The technology isn't so difficult,'' he
said. ``The difficulty is to really understand what is happening in the
nervous system.''

... we had here data line breakdown last week and no Internet connections
worked. It happened so that there was heavy icing on the line between Oulu
and Kajaani which caused the break.. we had reserve line but that was also
broken.. that line was leased from Finnet and it happened that as

leased from the primary operator! The agreement with Finnet was ended

I have had recent and vivid evidence of the risks of much-hyped "electronic
ticketing" systems for air travel. My wife called to confirm her reservation
on a return flight, only to discover that, according to the airline she had
already flown a week earlier. "You've used that ticket," she was told. Since
electronic ticketing procedures require that the agent match the user's ID
with the ticket information, she was treated like someone trying to scam the
airline by flying twice.

Fortunately, the date of usage was different than the date for which
the ticket was issued, although the flight number was the same, and
she had various records, such as her credit card receipts, through
which to assert her identity, but only after many hours on the phone.

The supervisor who finally resolved her case seems to be handling a lot of
electronic ticketing problems. The agent is supposed to look at the
passenger's ID, and pull up the ticket record corresponding to that
traveler. However, there is also a receipt for the electronic ticket: "not
valid for travel" that has the name and ticket number on it. Apparently, in
this case, the gate agent used the ticket number from the receipt, but typed
it in wrong, then failed to notice that the ticket record retrieved was for
a different passenger than the one named on the receipt.

No record is made of the validating transaction (the agent matching the ID
against the ticket record), except for the agent marking the record as used,
so the airline has no way of knowing who actually traveled on our ticket,
and we had no way, within the system, of documenting the fact that the
ticket had been used by someone else.

I, for one, will stick with a physical ticket.

&gt;We need to address the risks involved in even _having_ a 1 April in the
&gt;calendar.  What if a powerful newbie takes a 1 April prank seriously, and
&gt;dives in to "fix" something?  What are the risks there?

Shrug. Christmas offends non-Christians. Should we do away with it?
Halloween has satanic roots (according to some; it's actually pagan.  Not
everyone sees the difference).

No offense intended to William Evans, but this seems to me to be
well-intentioned but creeping PC-ism. Someone might interpret an April fools
joke wrongly. Therefore, do away with April fools. Someone might drink,
drive and kill someone in a car. Obviously, do away with drinking and
driving.

Personally, I'd go for the cars first. They kill a lot more people than
April Fools jokes do. I think we need to keep perspective. Just because
there *is* a risk doesn't necessarily mean we have to obliterate anything
that causes a risk.

Life is not about removing risks. Life is about understanding and managing
risks, and resolving SERIOUS risks. Just because something might be a
problem doesn't mean it is, or is worth fixing....

Now, having said that, folks who pull stunts like this (not that I'd know
anyone who has, not me. nope) have a responsibility to do so in a
non-destructive manner. It's sort of like drinking and driving -- it's not
the drinking that's the problem, it's the idiot who doesn't know enough not
to drive drunk. A good April Fools joke merely causes embarrassment when
someone falls for it. That's half the fun of designing those things.  If
they cause damage by design or accident, then the writer of the joke ought
to be responsible for the impact of it. Doesn't matter if you meant to throw
a firecracker at someone or not, if you blow off a finger, "I didn't mean
to" isn't a valid defense...

I think this piece brings up an interesting meta-question: the risk of
RISKS: by focusing on risks in this forum, do we run the risk of losing
perspective on risk? Because if we are just as seriously talking about doing
away with April 1 over the risks of a misplayed joke as we are bugs in air
traffic control systems and the risks to human life, then we sure have lost
our sense of perspective. All risk is not created equal, and sometimes we
seem to forget that...

I just discovered a problem with Insight's new WWW based on-line
purchasing system.  Insight sells personal computers &amp; peripherals.

When purchasing an item, the system asks you to set up an account first.
Setting up an account is simply filling in a form with name, address, and
phone #.  An account # is then assigned.

A coworker set up an account with them a few weeks ago and bought
something for his personal use, though he gave the office phone #.  I set
up an account a few days ago to buy something for work and gave the same
office phone #.  The system gave me the coworker's account #, but gave no
indication that this was an existing account.  All information needs to be
entered again at "check-out" in addition to supplying a credit card # &amp;
shipping address.

I received my order today with my coworker's name &amp; home address on the
bill.  I called and explained the situation.  The service rep told me that
account #'s are keyed to the phone #.  She checked and told me that the
proper credit card had been billed, but that the credit card co. had not
checked the order for a correct billing address, etc. (This check is
pretty standard for mail order these days.  In fact, most outfits will
only ship to the CC billing address).  So no harm done, but I had a hard
time convincing the rep that this was a problem that needed to be
addressed.  I can imagine a scenario where a someone's home address is
given to some jerk in the same office who's been harassing him/her.  And
what if my phone # changes?  And the old number is reassigned?  The phone
# is also used as a "password" to help verify the account # when checking
order status.  Will we never learn?

Most users have learned at least once that a computer will do what it's
told, even if it's not what the user intended (provided the input is valid).

It would appear that many users are careless about handling and entering
e-mail addresses.  If such carelessness results in an invalid e-mail address,
no real harm is done; the originating user will probably get a message back
to that effect, realize his error, and resend the message with the
destination address duly corrected.

However, an error that results in a valid e-mail address has potentially more
serious consequences.  It can result in a significant and embarrassing
breach of privacy, and, depending on the honesty and the diligence of the
unintended receiver, may remain unknown to the sender until it surfaces
through some other means.  I often receive misaddressed e-mail, some of it
intensely private in nature.  While courtesy and common sense dictate that I
return it promptly to the sender and inform him of the error, nothing about
the Internet can guarantee the sender that any private information he
unintentionally disclosed to me will not be abused.

E-mail addresses, like telephone numbers, can be wrongly transcribed or
miskeyed.  With a burgeoning user population, it would seem that there is an
increasing probability that a randomly miskeyed e-mail address will actually
be someone else's e-mail address.  Users should develop an awareness of the
risks to their privacy (as well as to the effectiveness of their
communication!) of getting e-mail addresses wrong.

Please note that it is the U.S. Congress that aided the cell-phone
industry's initially remaining unsecure by making it unlawful to intercept
calls that thus allowed cell peddlers to tell tech-naive prospects that cell
calls were "safe".

But it is our federal enforcers -- led by the FBI -- who have zealously and
diligently *BLOCKED* installation in U.S. cellphones of often-proposed,
repeatedly-urged, readily-available automated scrambling technology to
uncrackably protect the privacy of personal cell-phone calls, and also
protect cell-phone id numbers -- that are *still* broadcast in the clear and
thus trivially intercepted and cloned, costing the cell industry "billions"
of dollars (that is, *if* the folks using cloned fones would actually pay
for the calls that they make for free).

My information is that our FBI even had a major hand, earlier this decade,
in keeping the European cell-phone standards committee from finally
adopting cell-phone standards that they ready to accept, that included
automated uncrackable voice scrambling for *all* new cell phones.

Seems our FBI told the French security folks how awful that would be for
government snoops (i.e., all cell-users must be considered potentially
guilty of something), and the French instantly demanded that the
call-security aspects of Euro cell-phone standards be trashed.  They were.

significantly more modest than what the Bureau had asked for in a earlier

and PC platforms and anything from a 386/SE 30 to Pentium Pro 200/Power PC
100.

A macro itself, it builds on the concept that some things in WORD are not
subvertable by a document/template and provides a mechanism for detection of
any abnormalities.

Like the rest of my programs, it has not a clue what a virus is, instead it
gives users visibility into the areas where viruses reside and allows the
user to decide what to do (DELETE ALL is an option).

I have designed it to be compatible with other anti-virus programs (even
SCANPROT) though MacroList is effective even against E-Mail launches of
encrypted messages.

Enough said: it may be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.netmind.com/~padgett/">http://www.netmind.com/~padgett/</A>

Community Space &amp; Cyberspace
What's the Connection?

March 1 - 2, 1997, 9:00 am - 5:00 pm
University of Washington HUB
Seattle, WA  USA

Will cyberspace destroy society by turning us all into high-tech couch
potatoes?  Or will it provide unprecedented opportunities for community
involvement?  On March 1 and 2, 1997, Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility (CPSR) will present its sixth DIAC ("Directions and
Implications of Advanced Computing") conference to help answer those
questions.  The theme is "Community Space and Cyberspace: What's the
Connection?" and our aim is to challenge some of the cyber-spacy hype and
bring the discussion back to earth to the communities we live in.

Howard Rheingold, best-selling author of "The Virtual Community:
Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier" will give the keynote address on
March 1.  Howard's presentation will be followed by panel discussions on
economics, education, high-technology social mediation, and other topics.
In these panels computer pioneers, activists, and other thinkers and doers
will describe their experiences and ideas on what has changed, what may
change, and, most importantly, what citizens can do to make the technology
more responsive to community needs.

Some of the Panelists include (among others)

+ Peter van den Besselaar, Social Science Informatics, University of
Amsterdam and De Digitale Stad (the Digital City), Amsterdam
+ Amy Borgstrom, Executive Director, ACENET, OH
+ Amy Bruckman, Researcher, MIT Media Lab, Cambridge, MA
+ Steve Cisler, Senior Librarian, Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA
+ Jamie McClelland, Libraries for the Future, New York, NY
+ Peter Miller, Network Director, Community Technology
Center's Network (CTCNet), Newton, MA
+ Kevin Rocap, California State University at Long Beach
+ Roland Waters, CEO, RTIME, Inc.

The second day, March 2, will feature workshops on a variety of topics
presented by practitioners from the Pacific Northwest, Boston,
Amsterdam, New York City, and many other places.

Workshop Topics include

+ Libraries in Cyberspace
+ Community Voice Mail for Homeless Clients
+ Networking for Non-Profits
+ City Government Programs On-Line
+ Telecommunications and Educational Reform
+ On-Line Services: Forum for Collaboration or Technology of Isolation?
+ Safety in Cyberspace
+ Civil Liberties in Cyberspace
+ Navigating the Maze of Telecommunications Policy Changes
+ ...

The case involving Adelyn Lee and Oracle's CEO Larry Ellison (see
<A HREF="/Risks/18.07.html">RISKS-18.07</A>-08) resulted in Ms. Lee being found guilty of perjury and
falsification of evidence.  She had previously won a $100,000 settlement
against Oracle, using as evidence an e-mail message (``I have terminated
Adelyn per your request.'') supposedly sent to Ellison by her former boss,
Oracle VP Craig Ramsey.  The prosecutor claimed that Lee had sent the
message herself from Ramsey's account.  She faces up to four years in jail.
Subsequently, the judge ruled that she may not use any of that settlement
money to pay her bail.  [Source: *San Francisco Chronicle*, 29 Jan 1997,

The IRS is apparently going abandon its past Tax Systems Modernization
effort, on which it has spent $4 billion.  In testimony for the National
Commission on Restructuring [``reinventing''] the IRS, IRS Assistant
Commissioner Arthur Gross (who less than a year ago took on responsibility
for IRS computers) stated that the systems ``do not work in the real
world.''  (Past criticism has come from the Government Accounting Office and
the National Research Council.  See also <A HREF="/Risks/17.96.html">RISKS-17.96</A>, 18.23-25, 18.43.)
Gross noted that the IRS lacks the ``intellectual capital'' for carrying out
the effort.  One system had been cancelled earlier (the program for
converting paper returns to electronic form), and 12 more systems are under
review.  Gross is proposing to contract out the processing of individual
returns to commercial firms (which raises all sorts of privacy issues),
although that is only a small portion of the processing demands.  [Source:
An item from *The New York Times*, seen in the *San Francisco Chronicle*, 31
Jan 1997, A1.]

A subsequent editorial on the IRS's plight [*Chron*, 2 Feb 1997] also
reminds us that the FBI ``threw away'' a $500-million fingerprint-on-demand
computer and its crime information database, the State of California spent
$1 billion on its nonfunctional welfare database system, along with more
millions on BART and the DMV.  Readers of RISKS are well aware of the
difficulties of developing large systems.  The real question is whether
anyone is learning from the past experience.  If only we were building
bridges and Henry Petroski were able to help us!

Last August, sixty Colombian soldiers were kidnapped by the Fuerzas Armadas
Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), a Marxist-Leninist guerrilla group.  The
Colombian Government announced a few days ago that they would change from
negotiating with the kidnappers through face-to-face meetings with
intermediaries, which is slow and dangerous, to negotiating by e-mail.

Just after the announcement, the Government received a puzzled message from
the FARC, saying that they had already received two e-mail messages claiming
to be from the Government.  The e-mails are thought to have come from
right-wing saboteurs who do not want any negotiations to take place.

An interesting scandal concerning electronic banking occurred in Holland.

It needs a bit of introduction: Banks have a system of `direct debit'
whereby a company (originally the utility companies, now almost every
company that requires periodic payments for services) can directly charge an
amount to a client's bank account.  Clients have to agree to this in advance
by signing a statement authorizing a company to do such direct debits.  The
banks guarantee that, up to three weeks after such a debit has occurred, the
client can undo the transaction.  Companies can use electronic-banking
software on their PCs to carry out direct debits.  The software package
(Girotel) is the same as the one clients can use to do their banking
electronically from their homes.

Last month, a Friesian church minister who publishes, I believe, a magazine
of some sort, requested a direct-debit arrangement so that he could directly
debit the accounts of his subscribers.  He was vetted by the bank and
declared reliable, so he got permission to carry out direct debit --
supposedly from consenting customers.

He then set to experimenting with it and discovered that he could
direct-debit the account of his sister-in-law without her signed agreement
and that he could also completely control the text on her bank statement
(except for the amount and the bank-account number).  He withdrew Hfl 2.50
from her account and got the text `Waterleidingbedrijf Friesland' (Water
utility company Friesland) on her bank statement.

Our minister was surprised and informed the press which led to some
considerable outrage about bank security.  A bank director, confronted with
the situation said that `nobody who had ever had money direct-debited from
his account wrongfully has not gotten it back' (sorry about the double
negative, but that's the way he put it).

The news programme in which he said this had just presented results from a
poll that showed that 20% of the people interviewed never check their bank
statements.  One wonders how the bank discovers whether people who do not
check their bank statement have had wrongful direct debits.  The banks
certainly appear to ignore the authorizations.  The reporter, unfortunately,
was not clever enough to ask the obvious follow-up question.

1. AOL's network bombed again, beginning at 2pm on 5 Feb 1997, and was not
fully restored until about 4:30pm.  The problem was attributed to a
"technical glitch" in a software upgrade.  [When have we heard that one
before?]

2. AOL was inaccessible to new sign-ons for about 20 minutes on 2 Dec 1996,
due to a ``software system bug'' in preparing for the influx of users
expected when the flat-rate charges went into effect; the 165,000 existing
sign-ons were left intact.  After fixing the bug at 4:55pm, AOL then blocked
about one of every 10 sign-on attempts for the evening.  (We note this case
retrospectively for the RISKS archives, although it may seem insignificant
in light of more recent problems.)

3. Cyber Promotions Inc got dinged twice this week.  On 3 Feb 1997, a
federal court barred them from sending unsolicited e-mail ads to
CompuServe's 5 million subscribers.  The next day, a different federal court
barred them from falsifying their FROM: addresses.  [I presume CPI will
still find ways to go through the (pro)motions.]

AOL's latest strategy: 45 minutes and out (via COMTEX Newswire  31 Jan 1997)
[Courtesy of the COMTEX  Newswire via CompuServe's Executive News Service]

&gt;    PC Week Online (January 30, 1997) - America Online Inc., trying to
&gt; alleviate its by now infamous network gridlock, has come up with a new
&gt; tactic: After 45 minutes on the service, users are being asked to log
&gt; off. If they don't respond in 10 minutes, their session is ended.  [...]
&gt; But there's one catch: Certain games, such as an AOL contest dubbed
&gt; "Neverwinter," disguise the dialog box, resulting in users being kicked
&gt; off the system without warning, according to some disgruntled subscribers
&gt; and an AOL spokesman.  [...]  The Dulles, Va., company posted a fix
&gt; enabling users to view the dialog box in its AOL Insider area earlier this
&gt; week, he said.

At the November 1996 meeting of the ISO/ANSI C++ Standard committee, the
computers provided by the meeting host for document preparation got an
infection of the MS Word "Concept" macro virus.  Since most attendees bring
a laptop, those got infected too.  We ended up spending twenty minutes in
full committee (~60 people) on explanations of how to eliminate it, and
protect against future infections.  The Concept virus, by the way, got its
big initial propagation aboard Microsoft Developer CDs.

Those of us who never use MS Word (because it's so buggy? see
<A HREF="http://www.cantrip.org/nobugs.html">http://www.cantrip.org/nobugs.html</A>) were tickled half to death.  If a room
full of C++ experts can't keep viruses off their machines, what hope is
there for Joe User?  (Those of us using Linux were, of course, unaffected.)

If ever there were grounds for a class action lawsuit against a
software distributor, this would seem to be it: releasing a program
with a virus susceptibility switch, with the switch defaulted to "on",
and then negligently distributing a sample virus to take advantage of
it.  Given the great difficulty this has caused many large organizations
(I gather the University of Oregon was severely disrupted) I would
expect to see many co-plaintiffs on such a suit.  (NB: IHNBAL*.)

The RISK?  The usual: badly-designed software and arrogance lead to
angry (or sometimes just embarrassed) customers, and lawsuits.

Incidentally, another RISK is causing users who know better than to run the
buggy software laughing themselves silly at those who don't, and then
getting punched in the nose.

Looking at Rational's Apex Ada development environment, I am not at all sure
I am 100% pleased with the syntax completion it performs.  It seems to me
that syntax completion, as part of compilation, is not a good thing as it
*repairs* errors rather than report them (eg. unpaired begin/ends).  The
obvious risk being that incorrect code will quite happily be "repaired"
(very possibly, incorrectly) and will compile successfully.

I believe syntax completion should be available during editing, but not
automatically employed during compilation.  As far as I can discover, it
cannot be switched off in Apex either.

This seems, to me, to be more dangerous than it is useful ...  eg. If you
accidentally delete the "end" from a nested "if", where does the analyser
stuff the "end"?  Indeed, even if it gets the placement correct (eg. by
inference from the indentation

PGN asked me to summarize an overwhelming number of contributions [some not
included in RISKS, except for what was in <A HREF="/Risks/18.64.html">RISKS-18.64</A>,78,79] regarding the
*Shetland Times* case.

The most significant point to note is that the court case has yet to
happen.  A judge has merely granted a temporary injunction ("interim
interdict") preventing The Shetland News making hyper-text links to *The
Shetland Times*, pending a full court case later this year. That decision
was passed in October 1996 and no legal precedent has been set in doing so.

The case is being fought on the grounds of breach of UK Copyright Law.  The
final decision will probably rest on what constitutes a headline and whether
the headlines in question can be treated as a separate work either
individually or en masse, and whether websites fall within the definition of
'cable programme service' in the UK legislation.

At this stage the much touted implications of the outcome of the trial are
highly speculative, often greatly exaggerated *and* are largely provisional
on the complaint being upheld. Thus comments in this forum are best reserved
at this stage, pending the actual trial and possible appeal, until the legal
and technical RISKS, if any, become known.

*****************************************************
Maryland Recycles Law On "Annoying" E-Mail
*****************************************************

A Maryland bill that would make it illegal to send "annoying"  or
"embarrassing" e-mail was introduced this week by Democratic General
Assembly member Samuel Rosenberg.

The bill got little support when it was introduced last year, but
Rosenberg hopes to play off of recent murders involving electronic mail to
see the bill passed.

Civil liberties groups argue that the law would be unconstitutional, and
that the terms "annoy" and "embarrass"  are too vague to be meaningful.
If passed, House Bill 778 would amend the state's criminal harassment law
to prohibit the use of e-mail to annoy, abuse, torment, harass, or
embarrass other people, with violators receiving a fine up to $500 and
three years in jail.

A similar bill introduced last year is quietly progressing through New
York's state legislature. Senate Bill 1414, introduced by Democratic State
Senator Ray Goodman, could be voted on in the House early this year.

Full text of the Maryland bill can be found at

[Summary: an ActiveX control can add a pending online transfer to
your Quicken file]

While interesting, this is a great example of "I told you so."  When you
accept an ActiveX control, you're allowing completely arbitrary code to
rummage around your machine and do anything it pleases.  That same code
could make extremely expensive phone calls (900 numbers or whatever) with
your modem; it can read, write, and delete any file on your computer; it can
install Trojan horses and viruses.  All without any of the subterfuge and
hackery required to do it with Java.  ActiveX hands away the keys to your
computer.

That said, ActiveX still has its uses.  On a corporate internal network,
ActiveX is a nice replacement for custom internal applications, where the
internal app would have been completely trusted, anyway.  ActiveX across the
*Internet*, however, is a disaster that doesn't have to wait very long to
happen.  The only security barrier is an annoying dialog box that many users
will either ignore or configure away [one wrong click and you now trust code
signed by each and every key issued by a given CA (e.g., VeriSign)].

The solution?  Blocking ActiveX (or Java) at the firewall seems fragile, at
best [see Dave Martin et al.].  Ideally you want to install your security
policy [e.g., only allow ActiveX signed by your IS department] inside every
user's Web browser.  I can't speak for any browser vendors, but it's safe to
suspect they're working on it.

Last night, in his State of the Union address, President Clinton advocated
placing confidential medical data online, as well as getting schools
connected to the Internet.  So long as his administration is opposed to
strong encryption and insistent on putting sensitive private information on
the net, the risks are numerous.  This contest offered a $1000 prize.  The
price for specific data on the net probably runs much higher than that.

The new issue of "Dagens IT", no. 3, dated 28 Jan - 3 Feb 1997 (a Swedish
paper aimed at information technology professionals), contains an item that
might be of some interest to those RISKS readers who followed discussions
about automatic highway toll booths in the US and related subjects.

My (probably imperfect) translation follows.

Car users will be be put in "feetcuffs"
(written by Margaretha Sundstroem)

With the help of a new satellite system car users might pay different taxes,
depending on when and where they drive.  This is what the State
communications commission is said to be discussing.

According to (the newspaper) "Dagens Politik", the State communications
commission is discussing a proposal to use satellites for determining car
taxes in the future.  It is proposed that all of Sweden's 3.5 million cars
should be equipped with a little reader fastened to the instrument board.
Car users would then buy cards that can be inserted into the reader.  The
card would communicate with a satellite that would register where you drive
and for how long.  The car tax would then be withdrawn from the card.

The proposal has been put forward by the State institution for communication
analysis.  They estimate that just the Stockholm (tax) authorities would be
able to earn six billion crowns by using this system.

The costs for car users would thereby increase.

- - - -

The reference to "feetcuffs" (by analogy to "handcuffs" - ankle
shackles?)  is an allusion to radio transmitters that are irremovably
fastened to the ankles of some criminals in this country so that the
authorities can monitor their compliance with the rules of house arrest.

The word "communication" is meant to include car traffic etc.  The word
"billion" is given in its US meaning: a thousand million.

The risks?  Apart from the risks of having very complex systems
automatically determine how much you have to pay, there are the usual
privacy considerations. Some cry out "big brother".  Others say you are
already in this situation if you carry a cellular phone.

Some time ago I managed to run the battery down on my car and after getting
a jump start I found the radio, instead of displaying the station frequency
showed three bars (---) flashing. I didn't know what the hell this was about
so started randomly pressing buttons (the radio has 4 pre-set station
buttons) and found that buttons 1-3 changed the number but 4 didn't appear
to do anything. Eventually the display stopped flashing and wouldn't accept
any more button presses.  I was bemused.

Lying awake that night I realised that this was of course the security
system that Ford introduced into their audio systems: disconnect the power
source (here done by running the battery flat) and you need to enter a
security code to regain access to your system.

I asked around various Ford garages and eventually found one that offered to
give me the code -- apparently there is a database of all security codes
that is sorted by the serial code on the radio. I took it along and the guy
quite happily took the radio off and dug out the code and told me what to do
to set it; you get ten goes to put the right code in, after this you have to
leave it in the car with the ignition on, but the engine not running for 1
hour, after which you get to try again.

So where are the RISKS?

1. I received about half a dozen different sets of instructions on how to
reset the radio -- all from Ford staff! Introducing a technology throughout
your entire product spectrum and not making sure your staff know how to use
it...

2. The guy who found the code for me made no effort to ascertain that I had
a legitimate right to own the radio or retrieve the code. For all he knew, I
might have nicked it from a car that morning and be wanting to have it reset
in order to sell it later.

3. After finding out the code, he then wrote it on the case of the radio --
on a label provided by Ford for this purpose! So Ford on the one hand say
"If a thief removes the radio he can't use it because he doesn't know the
code" and on the other they're saying "If you need to know the code just
take the radio out and have a look on the case."

Not the most secure scurity system I've ever come across!

I have introduced three new features that I hope you will find useful.
<OL>
<LI>If you click on the bronze button next to each memorial you will
be taken to a page, specific to each memorial, where you can record
your thoughts about the memorial.
<P></LI>
<LI> You will notice that on these special memorial pages that the name
of the person is shown as a link. If you save this link you can 
directly return to the place in the VMG where their memorial is stored
without having to search through the pages.
<P></LI>
<LI>Pet memorials have been rearranged and also have all the individual
memorial pages and unique anchors.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
Please let me know of any problems you encounter and of any ways that
I can improve these services.</P>

<P>
The <A HREF="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/VMG">VMG</A>,
is not a place of death, but somewhere people can
celebrate their family, friends and pets; to tell the rest of us about them
and why they were special. People's attitude to death in Europe
and North America has undergone a radical change in the last one hundred
years. Death is no longer the commonplace event that it was when we were
less healthy and medical care was not as effective. Certainly we have lost
touch with the idea of remembering, though perhaps the fact that many people
feel the urge to trace their family tree is a remnant of the powerful
respect for ancestors that can still be found in countries like China, Japan
and Korea. We need to celebrate the Day of the Dead just as they do in 
Mexico!
<P>
In the Virtual Memorial Garden anyone can be remembered.
At the moment you see simple text much as you would
in your local newspaper, but in the future there will be more complex
memorials, with sound and images combining to tell you about someone
you never knew and how they touched those around them. Perhaps you will see
cyberpyramids and datasphinxes appearing. Certainly there will be electronic
crypts as pages devoted to whole families are assembled.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/VMG">Virtual Memorial Garden</A>
was written up on the front page of the Times
newspaper on 14th Aug 1995 (though they managed to print the URL
wrongly!). This generated a lot of media interest with small
paragraphs in other papers and several radio spots. Since then there have
been features in the New York Times, Sunday Telegraph and many other papers.
Canadian Television also broadcast a main news item about the
<A HREF="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/VMG">VMG</A> and the memorial for
Mark Isfeld. The BBC also featured the site on their 
<A HREF="http://www.bbcnc.org.uk/">Tomorrow's World</A> programme. The
VMG is included in lots of web site listings and has been a "Site of the Day"
at many different sites - I cant be bothered to include all the award logos
and links here...

</ADDRESS>
<P>
This is the first issue of a new on-line forum.  Its intent is to address
issues involving risks to the public in the use of computers.  As such, it
is necessarily concerned with whether/how critical requirements for human
safety, reliability, fault tolerance, security, privacy, integrity, and
guaranteed service (among others) can be met (in some cases all at the same
time), and how the attempted fulfillment or ignorance of those requirements
may imply risks to the public.  We will presumably explore both deficiencies
in existing systems and techniques for developing better computer systems --
as well as the implications of using computer systems in highly critical
environments.
</P>
<H4>Introductory Comments</H4>
<P>
This forum is inspired by the letter from Adele Goldberg, President of the
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), in the Communications of the ACM,
February 1985 (pp. 131-133).  In that message (part of which is reproduced
below), Adele outlined the ACM's intensified concern with our increasingly
critical dependence on the use of computers, a concern which culminated in
the ACM's support for a Forum on Risks to the Public in Computer Systems
(RPCS), to be developed by the ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy
(of which I am currently the Chairman).  My involvement in this BBOARD
activity is thus motivated by my ACM roles, but also by strong feelings that
this topic is one of the most important confronting us.  In keeping with ACM
policy, and with due respect to the use of the ARPANET, we hope to attain a
representative balance among differing viewpoints, although this clearly
cannot be achieved locally within each instance of the forum.
</P><P>
For discussions on requirements, design, and evaluation techniques for
critical systems -- namely, how to do it right in the first place so that a
system can satisfy its requirements and can continue to maintain its desired
abilities through ongoing maintenance and evolution, you will find a little
solace in the literature on computer science, computer systems, and software
engineering.  There is even some modest encouragement from the formal
verification community -- which readers of the ACM SIGSOFT Software
Engineering Notes will find in the forthcoming August 1985 special issue on
the verification workshop VERkshop III.  However, it is not encouraging to
find many developers of critical software ignoring what is known about how
to do it better.  In this RISKS forum, we hope that we will be able to
confront some of those problems, and specifically those where risks to the
public are present.
</P><P>
You should also be aware (if you are not already) of several related on-line
services:  HUMAN-NETS@RUTGERS for a variety of issues pertaining to people
(but originally oriented to the establishment of WorldNet), SOFT-ENG@MIT-XX
for software engineering, and perhaps SECURITY@RUTGERS for security -- it is
still young and rather narrow (car-theft prevention is big at the moment,
with a few messages on passwords and forged mail headers).  (You can get
more inforation from SRI-NIC.ARPA:&lt;NETINFO&gt;INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT.)  I look at
these regularly, so some cross-fertilization and overlap may be expected.
However, the perspective of RISKS seems sufficiently unique to justify the
existence of still another interest group!
</P>
<H4>RISKS Forum Procedures</H4>

I hope all this introductory detail does not deter you, but it seems to be
worthwhile to set things up cleanly from the beginning.  To submit items for
distribution, send mail to RISKS@SRI-CSL.ARPA.  For all other messages
(e.g., list additions or deletions, or administrative complaints), send to
RISKS-Request@SRI-CSL.ARPA.
<P>
Submissions should relate directly to risks to the public involving computer
systems, be reasonably coherent, and have a brief explicit descriptive
subject line.  Flames, ad hominem attacks, overtly political statements, and
other inappropriate material will be rejected.  Carefulness, reasonably
clear writing, and technical accuracy will be greatly appreciated.  Much
unnecessary flailing can be avoided with just a little forethought.
<P>
Contributions will generally be collected and distributed in digest form
rather than singly, as often as appropriate.  Subject lines may be edited in
order to group messages with similar content.  Long messages may have
portions of lesser interest deleted (and so marked), and/or may be split
across several issues.
<P>
Initially we will provide distributions to individuals, but as soon as there
are more than a few individuals at any given host, we will expect the
establishment of a file &lt;BBOARD&gt;RISKS.TXT or equivalent on that host -- with
local option whether or not to forward individual copies.  Back issues may
be FTPed from SRI-CSL.ARPA:&lt;RISKS&gt;RISKS-"vol"."no", where "vol" and "no" are
volume and number -- i.e., RISKS-1.1 for this issue.  But please try to rely
on local repositories rather than swamping the gateways, nets, and SRI-CSL.

<P>
Following are excerpts from ACM President Adele Goldberg's letter in the
Communications of the ACM, February 1985 (pp. 131-133).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  On this day [8 October 1984], the ACM Council passed an important
  resolution.  It begins:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    Contrary to the myth that computer systems are infallible, in fact
    computer systems can and do fail.  Consequently, the reliability of
    computer-based systems cannot be taken for granted.  This reality
    applies to all computer-based systems, but it is especially critical
    for systems whose failure would result in extreme risk to the public.
    Increasingly, human lives depend upon the reliable operation of 
    systems such as air traffic and high-speed ground transportation 
    control systems, military weapons delivery and defense systems, and
    health care delivery and diagnostic systems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
  The second part of the resolution includes a list of technical questions
  that should be answered about each computer system.  This part states that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    While it is not possible to eliminate computer-based systems failure
    entirely, we believe that it is possible to reduce risks to the public
    to reasonable levels.  To do so, system developers must better
    recognize and address the issues of reliability.  The public has the
    right to require that systems are installed only after proper steps
    have been taken to assure reasonable levels of reliability.
<P>
    The issues and questions concerning reliability that must be addressed
    include:
<OL>
    <LI>What risks and questions concerning reliability are involved when
       the computer system fails?

    <LI>What is the reasonable and practical level of reliability to
       require of the system, and does the system meet this level?
  
    <LI>What techniques were used to estimate and verify the level of
       reliability?

    <LI>Were the estimators and verifiers independent of each other
       and of those with vested interests in the system?
</OL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Adele's letter goes on to motivate the ACM's authorization of a forum on
risks to the public in the use of computer systems, of which this is an
on-line manifestation.  As you can see, I believe that the charter must be
broader than just reliability, including as appropriate other critical
requirements such as fault tolerance, security, privacy, integrity,
guaranteed service, human safety, and even world survival (in sort of
increasing order of globality).  There is also an important but probably
sharply delimited role for design verification (such as has been carried out
in the multilevel-security community in demonstrating that formal
specifications are consistent with formal requirements) and even code
verification (proving consistency of code and specifications), although
formal verification technologies seem not suited to mammoth systems but only
to selected critical components -- assuming that those components can be
isolated (which is the operative assumption in the case of security kernels
and trusted computing bases).  For example, see the VERkshop III proceedings
noted above.

</i><PRE>
One of the activities of the ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy
will be the review of a problem list presented by Dan McCracken and his
committee in the September 1974 issue of the Communications of the ACM, and
an update of it in the light of dramatic changes in the use of computers
since then.  Three items from that problem list are particularly relevant to
our RISK forum.

   * Computers and money
   * Computers and privacy
   * Computers and elections

Indeed, in the latest issue of the ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes
(July 1985), I reported on a variety of recent money problems, security
problems, and a whole string of potential election-fraud problems -- in the
last case suggesting opportunities for Trojan Horses and local fraud.  On
the third subject, there was an article by David Burnham (NY Times) in
newspapers of 29 July 1985 (NY Times, SF Chron, etc.), on vulnerabilities in
various computerized voting systems.  About 60% of the votes are counted by
computer programs, with over a third of those votes being counted by one
program (or variants?) written by Computer Election Systems of Berkeley CA.
Burnham writes, "The allegations that vote tallies calculated with [that
program] may have been secretly altered have raised concern among election
officials and computer experts... In Indiana and West Virginia, the company
has been accused of helping to rig elections."  This topic is just warming
up.

Items that also give us opportunities for discussions on risks to the
public include these:

   * Computers and defense
   * Computers and human safety 
   * Computer-user consumer protection
   * Computers and health
   * Informal and formal models of critical properties
     (e.g., not just of security or reliability, not 
      so high-level as Asimov's 3 Laws of Robotics)

Several items on computers and defense are included below.  There are also
some comments on software that is safe for humans.

I would think that some sort of Ralph-Nader-like consumer protection
organization might be appropriate for computing.  We have already had two
very serious automobile recalls due to program bugs -- the El Dorado brake
computer and the Mark VII computerized air suspension, and at least two
heart pacemaker problems (one which resulted in a death), as noted in the
disaster list below -- to go along with this summer's watermelon recall
(pesticides) and Austrian wine recalls (with the antifreeze-component
diethylene glycol being used as a sweetener).

Readers of the ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes have been alerted in
many past issues to numerous disasters and computer curiosities implying
potential or actual risks to the public.  A summary of events is catalogued
below, and updates earlier versions that I circulated in a few selected
BBOARDS.  Further details can be found in the references cited.  Awareness
of these cases is vital to those involved the design, implementation, and
operation of computer systems in critical environments, but is of course
not sufficient to prevent new disasters from occurring.  Significantly
better systems, and more aware operation and use, are also required.

       SOME COMPUTER-RELATED DISASTERS AND OTHER EGREGIOUS HORRORS
              Compiled by Peter G. Neumann (21 July 1985)

The following list is drawn largely from back issues of ACM SIGSOFT Software
Engineering Notes [SEN], references to which are cited as (SEN vol no), where 
vol 10 = 1985.  Some incidents are well documented, others need further study.
Please send corrections/additions+refs to PGNeumann, SRI International, EL301,

considering the feasibility of developing what is probably the most complex
and most critical system ever contemplated.  It is highly appropriate to
consider the computer system aspects of that effort here.  Some of the
potential controversy is illustrated by the recent statements of David
Parnas, who presents a strongly skeptical view.  (See below.)  I hope that
we will be able to have a constructive dialogue here among representatives
of the different viewpoints, and firmly believe that it is vital to the
survival of our world that the computer-technical issues be thoroughly
discussed.  As in many other cases (e.g., space technology) there are many
potential research advances that can spin off approaches to other problems.
As indicated by my disaster list above, the problems of developing software
for critical environments are very pervasive -- and not just limited to
strategic defense.  But what we learn in discussing the feasibility of the
strategic defense initiative could have great impact on the uses that
computers find in other critical environments.  In general, we may find that
the risks are far too high in many of the critical computing environments on
which we depend.  We may also be led to techniques for developing better
systems that can adequately satisfy all of their critical requirements --
and continue to do so.  But perhaps most important of all is the increased
awareness that can come from intelligent discussion.  Thus, an open forum on
this subject is very important.  PGN

Subject: News Item: David Parnas Resigns from SDI Panel

New York Times, 7/12/85, page A6:

SCIENTIST QUITS ANTIMISSILE PANEL, SAYING TASK IS IMPOSSIBLE

By Charles Mohr
special to the New York Times

Washington, July 11 - A computer scientist has resigned from an advisory panel
on antimissile defense, asserting that it will never be possible to program a
vast complex of battle management computers reliably or to assume they will
work when confronted with a salvo of nuclear missiles.

  The scientist, David L. Parnas, a professor at the University of Victoria
in Victoria, British Columbia, who is consultant to the Office of Naval
Research in Washington, was one of nine scientists asked by the Strategic
Defense Initiative Office to serve at $1,000 a day on the "panel on computing
in support of battle management".

  Professor Parnas, an American citizen with secret military clearances, said
in a letter of resignation and 17 accompanying memorandums that it would never
be possible to test realistically the large array of computers that would link
and control a system of sensors, antimissile weapons, guidance and aiming
devices, and battle management stations.

  Nor, he protested, would it be possible to follow orthodox computer
program-writing practices in which errors and "bugs" are detected and
eliminated in prolonged everyday use. ...

  "I believe," Professor Parnas said, "that it is our duty, as scientists and
engineers, to reply that we have no technological magic that will accomplish
that.  The President and the public should know that."  ...

  In his memorandums, the professor put forth detailed explanations of his
doubts.  He argued that large-scale programs like that envisioned for the
program only became reliable through modifications based on realistic use.

  He dismissed as unrealistic the idea that program-writing computers,
artificial intelligence or mathematical simulation could solve the problem.

  Some other scientists have recently expressed public doubts that large-scale
programs free of fatal flaws can be written.  Herbert Lin, a research fellow
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said this month that the basic
lesson was that "no program works right the first time."

  Professor Parnas wrote that he was sure other experts would disagree with
him.  But he said many regard the program as a "pot of gold" for research
funds or an interesting challenge.

[The above article is not altogether accurate, but gives a flavor of the
Parnas position.  The arguments for and against feasibility of success need
detailed and patient discussion, and thus I do not try to expand upon either
pro or con here at this time.  However, it is hoped that a serious
discussion can unfold on this subject.  (SOFT-ENG@MIT-XX vol 1 no 29
provides some further material on-line.)  See the following message as well.

Subject: Miscellaneous comments on V1#2

Just some miscellaneous comments on some of the things in RISKS V1#2.
Hope this isn't too long.

1) Fishermen.  This sounds like a crock to me.  I wonder whether the
broken buoy or the fact that the storm was not predicted was the deciding
factor in the case.  Since the NWS/NOAA is providing a service, which
nobody is *required* to use, I can't understand how they can be sued for
not predicting a storm.  What would happen if they predicted a storm which
never showed up?  Could all the fishermen who stayed home sue for their
lost profits?  I can see it now....  "Cloudy Thursday, rain Friday -- use
this information at your own risk."

2) Union Carbide.  I always wonder in cases like this whether the plant is
actually having more accidents than usual, or if because of Bhopal we're
just hearing about it more because the press has a new victim to pick on.
The number of accidents at that plant is disgraceful.  Does anyone think
the government will shut it down?

3) Bob Carter's comments.  I think I agree with PGN on these... I would
prefer to see RISKS cover more or less anything related to computer
"hazards", rather than centering on one or two things.  There are plenty
of other lists which already take certain parts of this (e.g. SOFT-ENG for
"who's responsible" type stuff, ARMS-D for SDI).  I also like the SEN
quotes -- I don't personally read SEN, and even if some of the stuff is
dumb (computer kills scientist), overall I think the brief summary PGN
provided in V1 #1 gives a nice broad range of topics to discuss.

4) Medical programs.  I'm not sure I trust these fully yet.  I'd have no
qualms about my doctor using one to *suggest* things to him, but I would
draw the line at his accepting the program's diagnosis unless he could
verify on his own that it was correct.  For example, a heart specialist
interpreting a heart-diagnosis program's output would be good; a general
practicioner's taking it as gospel would not be good.  We need to make sure
the doctor is capable of knowing when the program is wrong.  (I saw a
comment about MYCIN once - "if you brought MYCIN a bicycle with a flat
tire, it would try like hell to find you an antibiotic.")

5) SDI.  I'm going to leave this for the experts.  I personally lean
towards Parnas's "side", but I don't know enough about it.  I do
like reading the comments on it though.  (BTW, for those of you who
haven't yet read Herb Lin's paper, it's excellent.)

Great list so far... keep it coming.  As a (possibly) new topic, did
anyone go to this AI show in San Diego (?) or wherever?  I saw a blurb on
it somewhere... how about a review of what the current toys are and what
risks they may take?  I remember seeing something about a program to
interpret the dials and gauges of a nuclear power plant....

Subject: Computer/hardship list

    Peter: One basis for a focussed discussion of risks would be to try to
establish a list of those computer systems whose failure would cause great
hardship --economic, political, social --to a significant number of our
citizens. For example, the failure of our computer-controlled electric
power grid or the failure of the Reserve's check clearance system.
              Your readers/participants could be asked to suggest the systems 
to be included on the list. Your forum could then discuss probabilies
of failure,costs of failures vs failure time, etc. etc..

Subject: Medical KBES

            Some AI systems may need FDA approval

    Expert systems come within the FDA ambit to the extent that
    they supplement doctor's work, according to Richard Beutal, a
    Washington D.C. attorney specializing in the legal aspects of
    technology. 

    An expert system may be defined as a computer program that
    embodies the expertise of one or more human experts in some
    domain and applies this knowledge to provide inferences and
    guidance to a user. some of the earliest and most
    sophisticated systems were developed for medical diagnosis:
    MCYIN, EMCYIN, CADUCEUS AND ATTENDING. [There are several
    more in use in Japan. --mjt] 

    Beutal called attention to proposed FDA regulations that, if
    implemented, would require medical expert systems to obtain
    FDA pre-marketing approval. Given that FDA approval for what
    are class 3 devices could take up to 10 years and that
    reclassifying such devices can take almost as long, these FDA
    regulations would virtually cause investment to dry up.

Subject: health hazards of CRT use

With respect to the introduction of the topic of the health hazards of
using video terminals, I would be particularly interested in seeing
discussion of risks to pregnant women and their unborn children. Both
Sweden and Canada have apparently introduced legislation which gives
pregnant women the right to change job assignments, whereas the
official US line seems to be that there is not sufficient risk to
warrant this.

The issue of the lobstermen indeed rested on the negligence of not repairing
the buoy.  (As noted in RISKS-1.2, the weather buoy went unrepaired for
three months.)  

Negligence and inaction in the presence of informed knowledge are likely to
be the source of more lawsuits in the future.  For example, the NY Times of
1 September 85 had an article by Richard Witkin on KAL 007.

  Evidence introduced in lawsuits filed in connection with the Soviet downing
  of the Korean Air Lines Flight 007 suggests that American radar operators
  knew hours beforehand that the jetliner was off course and heading into
  Soviet airspace.

  The words, "We should warn him", presumably referring to the plane's pilot,
  were heard at the Government's civil air-traffic control station in Alaska
  as the Boeing 747 strayed off course toward its fatal encounter with a
  Soviet fighter plane two years ago today, according to the documents.
  
  The documents were submitted Friday as evidence in damage suits filed
  against the United States Government by relatives of the 269 people who
  died in the incident.

Medical malpractice suits have been on the upswing, and doctors are taking
extraordinary measures to compensate -- such as higher prices and otherwise
unnecessary tests and drugs.  But the question of what constitutes
computer-related malpractice is likely to emerge as a very sticky one, e.g.,
faulty computer system design, life-critical application programming, and
sloppy computer operation.  And what about a debugger or maintainer who
notices something fishy but does not carry through?  A remarkable case of a
casual observer playing a significant role took place on 1 Sept 85 when a
passenger on People Express Flight 183 from Dulles to Newark noticed minutes
after take-off that a cowling was missing on one of the engines.  (The plane
returned to Dulles.)  Imagine a lawsuit against a company, which in turn
sues the programmer.  The potential for legal confusion relating to computer
systems is really quite awesome, and the confusion has just begun.  Suppose
the windshear-warning system is finally installed (with the 31 May 84
near-disaster on take-off of a UA 727 and the recent crash providing an
impetus), and suppose that program has a bug?  Suppose the computer is not
working on landing?  There are some very serious questions that must be
raised.  The incidence of high-award law suits elsewhere is likely to
provide a strong forcing function.

Subject:  Re:  health hazards of CRT use

To balance this discussion, we need to include risks to pregnant women
and their born and unborn children of television sets that run 18 hours
a day in the home.  

Keep in mind:  X-radiation is generally produced by the very high
voltages traditionally used in color television sets and composite-video
color monitors.  Many of the monochrome monitors need no such voltages
and, so, produce no such radiation.  

Since most folks are now buying color TVs for their homes, we need to
examine that aspect of safety as well, especially since many of them are
used as monitors for home computers and video games.

Yes, that seems right, though I wonder what the facts are concerning
how close one sits to the device. People spend more time a few feet
away from their terminals than their TVs.

There is also discussion in the literature on physical and psychological
problems resulting from sitting in front of your terminal for hours, most
notably back and neck problems, tension, stress, anxiety, and subsequent
depression.  This forum is not really the place to discuss another relevant
aspect of the problem, but let me just mention it anyway and then discourage
further commentary on it:  the standard American junk-food diet of coffee,
colas, and caffeine generally, orange juice, sugar, chocolate (containing
both sugar and caffeine), refined white flour, fried foods, and so on, is
now being linked with making many of those problems worse.

Subject:  Medical Software

Actually, culpability for mistakes caused by medical diagnosis software
could be placed with the same person who is responsible for correct
interpretation of all diagnosis aids:  the physician him/herself.
Programmers, like authors of medical texts, are providing tools for the
physician, not replacing him or her.

What we CAN do as computer scientists, et al., is to educate the
medical profession to the limitations of these tools as well as to their
benefits.  For ourselves, the goals should include error and risk
reduction as we continue to discuss.

Speaking of possible hazards due to hardware failure, has anyone out there
had any experience with Rolm's 32 bit Mil Spec machine the Hawk-32?  Since 
the Hawk is a Mil Spec machine, I'm sure it will be used in situations where
failure could lead loss of life.

I would be interested in hearing about the Hawk's environment limitations,
mean time between failures and any other experiences people have had with
the machine.

    [POSTSCRIPT: A few of you complained that the first issue had too much
     of a military flavor.  It is interesting that except for this last
     item, this issue and the previous issue had almost none!  On the
     other hand, the problems we are dealing with are universal, and
     we should be able to learn from all relevant discussions...  

     I had some complaints about the format breaking your dedigestifying
     programs.  I hope this is better, but if it really is, your programs 
     must be pretty stupid.  I did not change anything except the trailer.
     So maybe I don't have it right yet?

     Others complained that the issues were too big and did not come out
     often enough.  (I explained why -- I wasn't around.)  Now you will
     undoubtably complain that that they are too small and too frequent.
     But it really depends on what contributions are available.  PGN]

This morning, my radio said something about a consumer group wanting
Ford to recall 1.5 million engines. Nobody knows what's wrong, but they
are blaming it on the computer. (I didn't get the fine print. I wasn't
awake.) Anybody know if that's the real problem or just a convenient
scapegoat?

  [The 4 Sept 85 NY Times has a note on the recall of 454,000 
   Chevy/Pontiac compacts for corroding pollution control equipment, and
   105,000 VW and Audi cars for faulty brake hoses, but nothing on Ford.  I
   would love to follow up on the 1.5 million Fords, but haven't found 
   anything yet.  PGN]

Subject: Risks in CAD, etc.

Something, I have been wondering about, perhaps for future discussion might
concern liabilities of CAD products.  It seems more merchandise I purchase
is shoddy, and I am beginning to wonder what some of the consequences of
"making the metal a bit thinner to save.."  could be.  I realize we are
using CAD and simulation tools to make things more efficient, perhaps the
case of the over efficient engine which flamed out when it flew through rain
[as reposted in SEN, I believe] might be a case in point.  What were our
margins of safety in the over-engineering we did in the past?  Any studies yet?

Lastly, regarding mail formats:  I have run on a gamut of different mailers
[my current one, mh, is not bad], but I can sympathize with those having
problems.  It seems Peter's comment about programs was a bit harsh.  I used
to read netmail on an IBM machine which concatentated all letters and was
destructive [read once mail].

Subject: crt &amp; non-crt risks

It is important we separate crt from non-crt risks.  X-rays, color-perception, 
&amp; possibly eye fatigue I see as crt related.  Posture may be, for a person 
tied to the tube for extended periods.  Junk food is a non-crt risk, but may 
be a denial-of-service risk, if introduced into certain apertures around the 
crt.  Might also be a hazard to your health, if conductive. 

X- &amp; like radiation:  I am done producing children, I hope.  So does my
wife.  Unless radiation reaches carcinogenic levels, I am not concerned for
me.  My children all use/will use crts, unless some other display becomes
more economical in the near future.  We have 5 children, all of age.  I am
concerned about them.

Posture:  As an occasional, voluntary, crt user, my posture is my problem. 
Take the paper out of my office; or give me a clerical/data entry type job; 
then I will see posture as a crt/computer risk.  Any obstetrician will worry 
about any woman who sits in any one position for long periods.  At one point 
in one pregnancy my wife had to fly home while I drove alone - solely so she 
would not have to sit still too long.  (Many years ago I was told that the 
blood supply to the brain passed through the peri-anal region.  This accounts 
for the number of dumb comments and sleeping attendees at various conferences 
with inadequate breaks.) 

Color-perception:  When I go home after dark tonight, the white line will be 
pink.  No, I'm not on anything.  If the screen were pink, the line would be 
green.  If color sensitivity mattered to me... say, if I performed color-
matching titrations in a hospital, or put color-coded resistors &amp; capicators
into non-ICs, I would worry about color perception.  

	Considering the liability discussion in V1 #4, perhaps we all should. 
In 1956 or 1957 I ran across the proceedings of something-or-other on human 
factors in submarine design.  Book was pretty beat up, so it had been around
for a while.  It cited some *railroad safety* research on color perception. 
I think the RR stuff was pre WW-II.  Said red &amp; green were neat colors for 
signal lights.  Also said *yellow symbols on a black background* were the 
best combination for a symbolic display... and that the reverse was the next 
best.  Hence, road signs.  Amber screens... ?  

Eye-fatigue:  Not crt-unique, but... look at anything long enough, your eyes 
will tire.  Look at anything slightly fuzzy, &amp; your eyes will tire quickly, as
they try to focus on the un-focusable.  

Summary:  If a tired terminal operator hits a tree on the way home, it might
be due to poor color perception, fatigue due to poor posture (read:
furniture), eye fatigue due to poor colors, poor contrast, fuzzy images.  It
might be a financial disaster for the firm that employed said deceased.
Some attorney might look closely into the work situation, and computers
would get a bad name when we are really talking about bad management of the
computer-workplace.

  [For those of you who do NOT read the ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering
  Notes, here are three items taken from my RISKS column in the July 1985
  issue on the subject of false arrests.  For those of you who have already
  read these items, you have come to the last message in this issue and need
  read no further.]

In the past quarter year, there were two different stories of people winding
up in jail due to computer-related snafus, and an earlier story that
serendipitously goes along with them.

1. The AnchoRages Of Sin

An article on page 17 of the 15 April 1985 issue of ComputerWorld  entitled

        ``DMV computer error puts innocent motorist in jail''

provides us with another software glitch with harmful side-effects.  (Brad
Davis [b-davis@@utah-cs.ARPA] was the first to point this one out to me.)

The article (by Kathleen Burton) details how a mistake in programming the
new Alaskan Department of Motor Vehicles computer system resulted in
a motorist spending a night in a Fairbanks jail.  The computer indicated 
(erroneously) that C. R. Griffin was driving with a suspended license.
The article also said that only by human intervention were 400 additional 
driver's licenses not erroneously suspended.  Apparently the database
kept records of all violations in the past @i[five] years, but was supposed
to search only over the last @i[two] years for motorists who should be
suspended.  A programmer was quoted as saying that ``the cost of correcting
the mistake [in the program] was insignificant.''

2. Shirley There Must Be a Way Out

And then, on 25 April 1985, the Associated Press ran a story about
congressional hearings on the FBI national crime computer.  Two incidents were
included.  The first involved an airline flight attendant who was falsely
arrested and detained because of incorrect information in the FBI's national
crime computer.  Sheila Jackson Stossier was arrested on 28 October 1983 at the
New Orleans airport, because a woman named Shirley Jackson was wanted by Texas
authorities.  She wound up in jail for the night and detained in Louisiana for
five days.  She now has an arrest record, and her married name Stossier is
listed in the computer as an alias.  Coincidentally, another Shirley (Jones)
was also wrongly arrested because another woman alias Shirley Jones was listed
in the computer -- despite the facts that they had different birthdays, were
six inches apart in height, and 70 pounds in weight.  ``Despite this, the
Sheriff's office refused to drop the charges.''  (To make matters worse, it was
later determined that the wanted Shirley was already in jail at the time!)

3. One in Five Warrant Records Were Wrong -- Poor Odds

David Burnham (NY Times News Service) reported the following 
related story on 12 Feb 1985.

  A Michigan man filed suit charging that he was wrongfully arrested five
  times in 14 months after an arrest warrant for a man using his name was
  placed in the national computer system of the FBI.  The man, Terry Dean
  Rogan, charged that four of the arrests occurred after Michigan police had
  made an unsuccessful effort to get the warrant changed.  Rogan contends and
  the police confirm that the man actually being sought was another person
  using Rogan's stolen identity and credit cards.  Rogan, who is 27 years old,
  is not wanted for any crime.

Subject: Joseph Weizenbaum's comments &lt;JOSEPH@MIT-XX.ARPA&gt;: sdi]

	Although there is a great deal of truth and wisdom in Weizenbaum's 
message, I believe that he overlooks the reason that SDI would be
destabilizing and another step in the Arms race.  It is not because
of the stated goals of the program (Reagan's March 1983 speech) but because
those goals are not achievable.  There would be nothing wrong with rendering
ICBMs and other weapons obsolete.  On the contrary, everyone should want to 
see every country, city, and town protected by an impenetrable shield that
would free it from the fear of the indiscriminate horror that rained down on
Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  It is because the SDIO efforts will not lead to 
technology of that sort, that SDI is the things that Weizenbaum says it is.

	 I agree with Weizenbaum that we need to seek non-technological
solutions.  Technology is not likely to provide solutions in a situation 
where we oppose a power with equally sophisticated technology.  

	I believe that SDI is one issue where both disarmament and armament
supporters could agree.  Both sides seek peace through different mechanisms,
but neither will find their goals advanced by an untrustworthy "shield".

Peter: I love your material that's being generated and produced, but I note
that it seems to weigh overwhelmingly against the computer.  Aren't people
sending you any GOOD stuff?  Like with the aid of a computer, 27 lives were
saved, etc.?  Like using the new NEC fingerprint computer, they were able to
match the Stalker's finger-prints in 3 minutes, etc?  Maybe you need a Call

Today's SF Chronicle had a nice article on "Computer Holds Promise in
Diagnosing Heart Disease", in greatly reducing the number of false
negatives.  But even there are significant risks.  Suppose you or your
doctor trusts the computer program more because it indeed has fewer false
negatives, and now you produce a false negative.  We are back to the case of
the woman who killed her daughter and tried to kill herself and her son
because the computer program had falsely produced an "incurable"
diagnosis.  (See the July 85 issue of Software Engineering Notes.)

Well, in the first issue of RISKS I recall saying there has got to be more
to this forum than just pointing out negative things.  I noted hope from the
research community, although one of the agonizing things that we have
observed in the ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT)
is the enormous gap between the research community and what is actually
being done in practice.  For critical systems, the ordinary software
development techniques are simply not good enough.

Yes, we should of course point out successes.  For example, the Shuttle
project has had many -- along with its much more visible problems.

Subject: Hot rodding you AT

In a recent issue of PC Magazine, Peter Norton espoused the idea of
substituting a faster clock chip to enhance performance.  Now, according
to the folk on the Info-IBM PC digest, this may create problems.  An
off the shelf PC AT is composed of components guaranteed to work to
IBM spec, e.g. 6 Mhz.  If I increase the clock rate, then the whole
rest of the machine has to be up to snuff.  If not, a part dies and
I pay a nasty repair bill.

Now if I took Mr. Norton's word as gospel, swapped chips and set
my PC AT on fire, would he be liable?  How about the publisher?

Subject: Hazards of VDTs and CRTs

When evaluating the risks associated with various forms of technology
it is sometimes useful to have in hand the available data.

The Food and Drug Administration published a study in 1981:

               An Evaluation of Radiation Emission
                              from
                     Video Display Terminals

                   HHS Publication FDA 81-8153

The ionizing, optical, RF and acoustic radiation from a number of
terminals was measured.  I will briefly quote some of the conclusions
of this study.

For ionizing radiation:

  3.5  DISCUSSION

  Sufficient research information is available to estimate a range of
  risks of injury from ionizing radiation exposure.  Delayed disease,
  such as heritable mutation or cancer, usually forms a basis for the
  estimation, expressed in terms of the instances of the effect per
  person per unit of radiation (rad,rem, or R).  The risk estimates
  form a basis for radiation protection guidelines.

  For a VDT operator, the radiation protection guideline for 
  individuals in the general population is appropriate.  The guideline
  -- 500 millirem per year -- is for man-made radiation exposures
  excluding medical use.  For both normal and Phase III operating
  conditions, the likely emission from a VDT is 0.1 mR per hour or less.
  Terminals capable of exceeding the 0.5 mR per hour regulatory limit
  receive special attention (see Section 3.2, above).  With assumptions
  of 6 hours of viewing per day, 5 days per week for 50 weeks per year,
  the annual radiation dose to an individual 2 inches from the front
  surface of a screen emitting 0.1 mR per hour would be 150 millirem.
  Note that 2 inches is an unrealistically short viewing distance; as
  one moves further away from the screen, the radiation exposure
  decreases correspondingly.
  
For RF radiation:

  4.5 DISCUSSION

  Research information on bioeffects for the frequency range 15kHz to
  125 kHz is lacking, so empirical estimates of injury are not possible.
  However, the radiation in this frequency region interacts only
  slightly with the human body, so that significant biological effects
  are unlikely.  At the present time, no standard or guideline has been
  adopted in the U.S. for grequencies below 10 MHz.

For ultrasound radiation:

  5.4 DISCUSSION

  When airborne ultrasound impinges on human skin less than 1 percent
  is absorbed, the remainder being reflected.  The ear, however, is an
  efficient coupler of acoustic energy from air into the human body.
  Therefore, investigations of the biological effects of ultrasound
  levels much higher than those found in the VDT survey have included
  temporary threshold shifts in hearing (6).  So-called subjective
  effects have also been associated with high levels of ultrasound
  exposure, and include fatigue, headache, tinnitis, instability, a
  "fullness" in the ear, and nausea.  One report (7) tentatively
  associates the subjective effects with audible high frequency
  components of sonic radiation.  The studies were performed in the
  exposure range 70-120 dB in an industrial setting, and at 150 dB.
  No long term effects or delayed injuries are known.

  No formal standard for ultrasound exposure presently exists in the
  U.S.  Among several voluntary guidelines available, the 
  recommendations of W.I. Acton of the United Kingdom were used to
  compare the VDT results, because they are the most conservative in
  this frequency range.  The highest acoustic measurement obtained
  from a VDT in this study was 68 dB, well below Acton's guideline
  of 75 dB, and well below the energies associated with biological
  effects.

For "ergonomic" factors:

  7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

  *****
  *****

  The word processing field has expanded much faster than has the
  understanding of its impact on people who use VDTs.  The impact
  may be felt in areas such as employee morale, compensation,
  work hours, and work conditions.  We suggest that work conditions
  be given serious conisideration as the primary cause of VDT-user
  complaints.  The problem is not simple, however.  An extensive
  review of stress factors in the word processing work area (10)
  identified five separate factors that contribute to fatigue:
  vision, posture, environment, task organization, and higher
  order items such as disease susceptibility.  As early as 1976,
  it was recognized that glare (room lighting reflecting from the
  VDT face plate), work position, ambient noise, and work duration
  (absence of breaks) could be the most important factors
  influencing the VDT worker's health (11).  The parallel
  between the 1976 and 1979 studies is sufficiently strong for
  us to suggest that efforts expended to reduce stress caused
  by these factors would also reduce the adverse impact on
  health.

The above quotes from the FDA document are some of its most important
conclusions.  References to additional work are provided in the
document.  There has been further work since the time of this report
(1981).  I do not have immediate access to these later references.  I
believe they tend to bear out the conclusions of this report.

From conversations with those closer to this field than I, I get the
impression that one of the major stress factors in commercial word
processing operations is the highly regimented work situation, and the
possibility of being fired, if the operator does not turn out a certain
minimum amount of mistake free work per hour.

Many of the crt/workplace issues you raise are shared by another group
whose members are quite diverse in their use of crt terminals:
secretaries. 

I know this is not quite the correct forum, but workplace rules and
legislation designed to "protect" users of terminals from problems of
posture, vision, and stress should consider this forgotten group of
workers as well.  Their problems are nearly the same.

In response to:

       Dave Curry's right. I remember reading a newspaper report which
    said, in essence, that the NWS/NOAA lost because it had failed to
    predict the storm.  I didn't believe it, so I read on, and the report
    said that since they had known of a broken buoy, had failed to repair
    it (I think it had been broken for several months), and therefore failed
    to get the information needed to give a warning, they were guilty of
    negligence and had to pay.  Quite a far cry from what the story had
    begun as!

On the other hand, the NWS also said that even if the buoy had been
alive at the time, they would not have predicted the storm.  This
isn't to defend sloppy journalism, just to point out that the
newspaper was in essence correct in this instance.

Did the NWS say that (i.e., even if the buoy had been alive at the time,
they could not have predicted the storm) in testimony, or after the verdict?
If after the verdict, no comment.  But if as testimony, Herb, the jury (or
judge) apparently didn't believe the NWS testimony.  If you believe the NWS
claim, the headline was correct, but it's unfair to say the court ruled that
way when it explicitly based its ruling on negligence.

	The problem with a forum on the risks of technology is that
while the risks of not using some technology, e.g. computers, are
real, it takes imagination to think of them.  A further problem
with newspaper, magazine and TV discussion of technology is that
journalists and free-lance writers tend to run in intellectual
mobs.  This biases the discussion for everyone, especially when
the same journalists read each others writings and call it public
opinion.  Here are some illustrations.

1. Suppose some organization manages to delay interconnecting
police data systems on some specious civil liberty grounds.
Suppose some wanted murderer is stopped for a traffic offense
but not arrested, because he is wanted in a jurisdiction not
connected to the computer system used by the police officer.
He later kills several more people.  The non-use of computers
will not be considered as a cause, and no-one will sue the
police for not interconnecting the computers - nor will anyone
sue the ACLU.  The connection will not even be mentioned in
the news stories.

2. No relative of someone killed on U.S. 101 during the 10 years
the Sierra Club delayed making it a freeway sued the Sierra Club.

3. No non-smoker who dies of lung cancer in an area newly polluted by
wood smoke will sue the makers of "Split wood not atoms" bumper
stickers.

***

Based on past experience, I expect this question to be ignored, but here's
one for the risk-of-computers collectors.  Is a risk-of-computers
organization that successfully sues to delay a use of computers either
MORALLY or LEGALLY LIABLE if the delay causes someone's death?  Is there
any moral or legal requirement that such an organization prove that they
have formally investigated whether their lawsuit will result in killing
people?  As the above examples indicate, the present legal situation
and the present publicity situation are entirely unsymmetric.

	Here's another issue of the social responsibility of computer
professionals that has been ignored every time I have raised it.

The harm caused by tape-to-tape batch processing as opposed to on-line
systems.

From the earliest days of commercial computing people have complained
about seemingly uncorrectable errors in their bills.  The writers
don't know enough to connect this with the use of tape-to-tape
batch processing.  Under such a system when a customer complains,
the person who takes the complaint fills out a form.  A key puncher
punches the form on a card.  At the next file-update, this card
goes to tape, and a tape-to-tape operation makes the correction.
If there is any error in the form or in the key punching, the
correction is rejected, and the customer gets the wrong bill again.
On-line systems permit the person who takes the complaint to make
the correction immediately.  Any errors in making the correction
show up immediately, and the person can keep trying until he gets
it right or ask for help from a supervisor.  Not only is the customer
better off, but the complaint-taker has a less frustrating job.

My own experience with the difference occurred in 1979 when my
wallet was stolen, and I had to tell American Express and Visa.
American Express had an on-line system, and the person who took
the call was even able to give me a new card number on the spot.
The Visa complaint-taker had to look it up on a micro-fiche file
and call back, and still they got it wrong.  They gave me a new
account number without cancelling the old one.

Perhaps this issue is moot now, but I suspect there are still
many tape-to-tape systems or systems using modern equipment that
still emulate the old systems.  Shouldn't computer professionals
who pretend to social responsibility take an interest in an
area where their knowledge might actually be relevant?

Once upon a time, beginning perhaps in the middle nineteenth
century, scientific organizations were active in pressuring
government and business to use new technology capable of
reducing risk and promoting the general welfare.  I have in
mind the campaigns for safe water supplies and proper sewage
disposal.  Here's a new one that involves computer technology.

Theft can be reduced by introducing the notion of registered
property.  When you buy a television, say, you have the option
of buying a registered model, and the fact that it is registered
is stamped on it.  Whenever someone buys a piece of used registered
property he has the obligation of telephoning the registry to
check whether the property with that serial number has been reported
stolen and recording his ownership.  Repairmen are also obliged
to telephone either by voice or by keyboard.

Unfortunately, too many computer people imagine their social
responsibility to consist solely of imagining risks.

I've received a number of responses to the remark I made that I would not
support the SDI program even if I thought it could be made to work.  I have
the feeling that,  if I try to respond globally, a full blown debate
may ensue.  That I really don't want to conduct with the bboard as the
medium of expression.  Nevertheless, I feel obligated to say just a few
words in an attempt to clarify some ideas that have probably been 
misunderstood.

I said that my attitude derives from what I called a "quasi pacifist"
position.  One writer thought that pacifists are opposed to all forms of
self defense.  Actually pacifists are often the first to come to the
defense of justice being trampled.  But the form of their resistance to
wrongs is non-violent.  It ought also not to be confused with "passive"
resistance - Gandhi often pointed out, usually by his own example, that there
is nothing passive about non-violent resistance.  My use of the term "quasi
pacifist" also elicited comment:  Am or am I not a pacifist?  Let me say I
strive to become a pacifist, to grow up to be one.  One isn't an adult by
virtue of merely wishing or claiming to be one.  Just so with being a
pacifist.  I am still far from the goal.

People apparently believe that, were the SDI technically feasible there
could be no reasonable objections to its development and deployment.
Wouldn't it be comforting if every region, every city and village in
America had, so to speak, an invisible shield over it which guarded against
the invasion of hostile missiles, they ask.  Speaking entirely in practical
terms, I would remind them that every year tons (perhaps kilotons) of
marijuana are smuggled past the U.S. Coastguard and the custom service.
Now that technical progress allows the construction of nuclear "devices"
smaller than a moderately sized overnight bag, a determined enemy could
destroy American cities without "delivering" war heads by air mail at all ! 
If I were responsible for national security, I would worry if, a few days
before the President's traditional State of the Union message, usually
delivered to the assembled leadership of all three branches of our
government, some foreign embassy evacuated all its personel.  Perhaps a
nuclear device of moderate size had made its way to Washington and is about
to decapitate the government.  We can no more bring peace to this globe by
putting impenetrable domes over nations than we can halt the violence in
our cities by providing everyone with bulletproof clothing.  Human problems
transcend technical problems and their solutions.

But suppose we could solve the smuggled bomb problem.

I would still oppose SDI.

SDI is an attempt at a technological solution to problems which have
their roots in and are social, political, economic, cultural, in other
words, human problems.  It is an attempt to find solutions under the the
light provided by technology when in fact we know them to reside only in
the human spirit.  That is what guarantees the failure of SDI more surely
than its complexity or the impossibility of its being tested.

Beyond all that is the fact that we live in a world of finite resources.
The scarcest resource of all is human talent and creativity.  The military
already commands the time and energy of most American scientists and
engineers.  Money is another scarce resource on which the military has first
call. On the other hand, social services of all kinds
are being cut back.  Meanwhile  the country faces social problems
of horrendous dimensions:  There is massive, deep poverty in the land.
Adequate health care is beyond the reach of millions of citizens and
ruinously expensive for many more millions.  The schools are spewing out "a
rising tide of mediocrity" while a huge fraction of our youth is functionally
illiterate.  The conditions that brought on the riots in American cities,
for example in Watts, have never been attended to - they silently tick
away, time bombs waiting to go off.

When resources are limited they must be distributed on the basis of a
widely based consensus on priorities.  To silently consent to lowering
still further the priorities our society assigns to the people's health and
education in favor of spending the billions of dollars required above and
beyond the already huge military budget for only the first stages of SDI,
is, it seems to me, to condone the continuing impoverishment and
militarization of not only America, but of the whole world. Ever more
scientists and engineers will be occupied with military work.  Ever more
industrial workers of many different kinds will be enmeshed in the
militarized sectors of society by, for example, being required to have
military security clearances.  There is a danger that, in the process of the
growing militarization of society, a certain threshold, hard to define but
terribly real, will be crossed and that, once crossed, there will be no ready
road back to a civilian society.

[Peter, I have also posted this to SOFT-ENG.  If you think the duplication
is reasonable, please include it in RISKS as well. -- mjm]

I've been thinking about the SDI system and how it will be implemented.  
Specifically, I've been looking at a system composed of N independent 
platforms, each of which performs its own detection, decision making, and
response.  Given this type of system, we can reach a few conclusions about
the reliability of the whole system, based on the reliability of a single
platform.  I've crunched a few numbers: nothing profound, just some basic
statistics.

Definitions:

1. A "false positive" is an attack response by a platform when such a response
   is not justified.
2. A "false negative" is failure of a platform to attack when an attack 
   response is justified.

Let's look at the false positive case first.  How likely is the system to
experience a false positive, based on the probability for each platform?

             N:    50        100        200        500       1000       2000
Pp:         +------------------------------------------------------------------

  1.000E-07 |  5.000E-06  1.000E-05  2.000E-05  5.000E-05  1.000E-04  2.000E-04
  1.000E-06 |  5.000E-05  1.000E-04  2.000E-04  4.999E-04  9.995E-04  1.998E-03
  1.000E-05 |  4.999E-04  9.995E-04  1.998E-03  4.988E-03  9.950E-03  1.980E-02

  1.000E-03 |  4.879E-02  9.521E-02  1.814E-01  3.936E-01  6.323E-01  8.648E-01

Pp is the probability that a given weapons platform will experience a false 
positive.  N is the number of platforms in the system.  The entries in the
table give the probability that a false positive will occur on at least one
platform (and one may be enough to start a war.)  For example, if there are
1000 platforms, and each one has a one-millionth (1.000E-6) probability of
experiencing a false positive, then the cumulative probability that some 
platform will do so is 9.995E-4, or .09995%.  Looking at the table, I'd say
the numbers in the lower right corner are rather disquieting, to say the least.

Now let's look at the false negative case.  The table is structured a little
differently here.  In the false positive case, a single failure is disastrous;
in the false negative case, it's not.  The probability of a false negative
should be many orders higher than that of a false positive, simply because the
protections against a false positive will actually enhance the chances of a
false negative.  This table deals with a 100-platform system (that being the
most my binomial coefficient routine can handle).

Pn is the probability that a given platform will experience a false negative.
N is the minimum number of platforms (out of 100) which respond correctly.
The table entries give the probability that at least N platforms respond
correctly.  For example, if the probability of a given platform experiencing
a false negative is 0.1 (10%), then the probability is 99.92% that at least
80 out of 100 platforms respond correctly, 58.32% that at least 90 respond
correctly, and so on.

Some of the Pn's and Pp's may strike you as much too high.  I don't think so. 
The two tables were constructed on the simplifying assumption that Pn and Pp
are constants; actually, they are reliability functions.  The longer a platform
is in service, the more likely it is to malfunction.  If we assume that the
time-to-failure rate of a platform is some form of Weibull distribution
[a*B*t**(B-1) * e**(-a*t**B)], then the reliability function is given by Z(t)
= a*B*t**(B-1).  I did not use this in constructing the tables in order to
keep from drowning in figures, and because I don't really know how to choose
a, B, and unit t, until we get a history of actual performance (and by then it
may be too late...)  Suggestions are welcome.

RE:  RISKS contribution from friend@nrl-csr (Al Friend, Space and 
     Naval Warfare Systems Command); RISKS-1.6

The 1981 FDA study cited by Friend probably contains much useful (albeit
rather "soothing") information about VDT *radiation* hazards (ionizing,
RF, and acoustic).  One should observe carefully, however, that the 
quoted material fails to mention other kinds of hazards, nor does its 
title reflect any others.  One should, therefore, not assume that 
*radiation* hazards are the whole story for VDTs.  I would have felt 
more relieved at the data presented had it included some other, more 
obvious, risk factors such as visual effects.

In particular, recent studies show that at least two visual effects may
be quite important as factors producing severe eye fatigue.  The first,
visual flicker (resulting from the screen refresh rate), is probably
well understood (from extensive psychovisual experimentation in
connection with TV viewing).  The higher screen refresh rates used on 
some computer graphic displays seem to minimize this problem.  However,
60 fields/sec (50, in Europe) is standard for most personal computers.

[Flicker depends on many factors: rate, ambient light, screen contrast, 
brightness, subject motion, color, etc.  More seems to be known about the 
conditions for minimal *perceptible* flicker than about those that can
produce visual fatigue, eyestrain, headaches, etc.  Also, there is a
fairly large variation among different subjects even for minimal
perceptible flicker, and flicker may be noticeable (and annoying) in 
the "fringe visual field" (off to the side) even when it is not detectable 
for the object directly ahead.]

The second factor is connected with the fact that the human eye is not 
chromatically corrected, i.e., its focal accommodation is different for
different colored objects.  The result is that when the eye is focused
correctly on a blue object, a nearby red object will be slightly out of
focus.  One study [1] indicates that the discrepancy is about 0.5
diopters (for a viewing distance of 50 cm).  According to one report
I've seen (sorry, I can't find the reference!), this means that in a
multicolored display the eye will automatically be making rapid
focus adjustments in scanning the screen.  Even worse, the effect can
also exist in some monochrome displays, i.e., where the character 
color (white, say) is achieved by a mixture of two differently colored 
phosphors separated substantially in wavelength.  In the latter situation 
it appears that (at least for some people) the eye may undergo extremely 
rapid focus oscillations in the futile attempt to bring both component 
colors into focus.   Quite understandably this may result in severe eye 
fatigue, even though the subject may not be consciously aware of what 
is happening.  This occurs mostly when the two phosphors radiate nearly 
pure spectral lines.  Single-phosphor displays and those where the 
component pure colors are close enough in wavelength seem not be prone 
to this disturbing effect.  I recall seeing the statement that AMBER 
displays are not objectionable for this reason, and that one nation
(Sweden or West Germany, I think) has specified amber displays for 
extended-time industrial use.

It seems to me that the chromatic refocusing effect is probably the more
serious of the two cited, especially on high resolution displays.  The
fact that it seems not to have been noticed on conventional (analog)
color TV displays may be accounted for by their relatively poor
resolution (low bandwidth).  Thus, the brain expects to see a sharper image
on a high-resolution (RGB) display than on a conventional TV (where
everything--especially the reds and oranges--is pretty blurred anyway).

In summary, in concentrating on the "serious" potential hazards of 
X-rays, etc., from VDTs, we should not thereby overlook the more obvious
factors concerned with the visual process itself.

Subject: Viruses, Trojan horses, and worms
To: RISKS@SRI-CSL.ARPA

	I would like to see a discussion by the members of this list
of the degree to which computer users, whether individuals or
organizations, are vulnerable to worms and Trojan Horses. These
terms, which first appeared in this list in #3, refer to programs
designed to inflict some form of unpleasantness on the user, up to
and including the destruction of the system. Typically they erase
all files in reach. I have read discussion, in Dvorak's column in
*Infoworld*, of the possibility that such programs might modify the
operating system as well such that when the unfortunate user tries
to restore the destroyed files from backup disks, those too would be
erased.  One can also imagine, vaguely, programs that are insidious
rather than calamitious, that introduce certain categories of error,
perhaps when strings of numbers are recognized. These might be able
to do even more damage over the long run.

	There are two issues with these programs. The first is what
they might do, once resident. The second is the nature of the
vector, to borrow a medical term. Worms can be introduced directly,
by 'crackers', or surreptiously, by hiding them inside a legitimate
program and waiting for an unsuspecting user to run that program on
his system, thus activating the 'Trojan Horse'. The article cited in
#3 had to do with a program camouflaged as a disk directory that was
circulated on the download BBSs. One could imagine a spy novel
devoted to the theme: perhaps it was the KGB, and not Ben Rosen, who
provided the money to launch Lotus. Inside every copy of 1-2-3 and
Symphony is a worm which, every time it is run, checks the system
clock to see if it was later than, say, October 1, 1985. On that
date the commercial and industrial memory of the United States dies.
The CIA suspects something is up, but they don't know what.
Unfortunately the director of the team working on the problem is a
KGB mole.  Fortunately there is this beautiful and brilliant female
computer genius ...

	Anyway, I have a specific question: can anyone imagine a
circumstance in which a program appended to a piece of text in a
system could get hold of the processor? It would appear not, which
is a good thing, because if such circumstances did exist, then it
would become possible to spread worms by pigyybacking them on a
telecommunicated piece of text. The right piece of text -- some
specialized newsletter, or even a crazily attractive offer from
a 'Computer Mall'-- might find itself copied into thousands of
systems. But I am not a technical person, and cannot establish
to my satisfaction that such an eventuality is truly impossible.

	Is it?

Absolutely not.  It is quite possible.  However, I can assure you that
this issue does not now include a virus -- although some message systems 
tend to permit you to edit a message before resending it, with no
indication that it has been altered.  Thus, even in the presence of all
of those routing headers, you can never be sure you really have picked
up or been forwarded the original message.  The example of squirreled
control characters and escape characters that do not print but cause
all sorts of wonderful actions was popular several years ago, and
provides a very simple example of how a message can have horrible
side-effects when it is read.

Worms, viruses, and Trojan horses from their technical aspects are probably
best discussed elsewhere -- e.g., in SECURITY@RUTGERS.  (See also Fred
Cohen's paper in the 7th DoD/NBS Computer Security Conference in 1984.)
From the RISKS point of view, they are definitely important to this forum
-- and they present a very serious risk to the public.  PGN]

    Did the NWS say that (ie, even if the buoy had been alive at
    the time, they could not have predicted the storm) in testimony,
    or after the verdict?  If after the verdict, no comment.

I believe it was during testimony, but I am not certain.

    But
    if as testimony, Herb, the jury (or judge) apparently didn't
    believe the NWS testimony.  If you believe the NWS claim, the
    headline was correct, but it's unfair to say the court ruled
    that way when it explicitly based its ruling on negligence.

But it is not clear that the court understands that the significance
of "missing data" is context-dependent.  Sometimes it matters, and
sometimes it doesn't.  This is a point that non-scientists have a very
hard time understanding.

I am not defending the NWS; they should have repaired the buoy.  But
given limited resources, how are they to set priorities in deciding
what to repair first?  The implications of the verdict are to me
frightening, placing NWS and all other similar organizations in a
double bind: all equipment must be functional even when they don't
have sufficient dollars to keep it that way.

Subject: Re: The Case of the Broken Buoy

    But it is not clear that the court understands that the significance
    of "missing data" is context-dependent.  Sometimes it matters, and
    sometimes it doesn't.  This is a point that non-scientists have a very
    hard time understanding.

At this point I'm going to bow out of the discussion, since I am not
familiar enough with the decision to know if the court understood that
point.  The NWS certainly should have made its position very clear, so
the court could make an informed decision (about whether or not
negligence was involved.)

    Subject: Hot rodding you AT

    In a recent issue of PC Magazine, Peter Norton espoused the idea of
    substituting a faster clock chip to enhance performance.  Now, according
    to the folk on the Info-IBM PC digest, this may create problems.  An
    off the shelf PC AT is composed of components guaranteed to work to
    IBM spec, e.g. 6 Mhz.  If I increase the clock rate, then the whole
    rest of the machine has to be up to snuff.  If not, a part dies and
    I pay a nasty repair bill.

    Now if I took Mr. Norton's word as gospel, swapped chips and set
    my PC AT on fire, would he be liable?  How about the publisher?

I doubt this would break anything.  The machine would simply cease
working above a certain speed, and resume working below that speed.

I know of a couple people who have done this on APPLE computers,
tried various speeds so as to run their machine at the highest speed
it will go.

Also, I once did the same thing with a synchronous link, i.e. hooked
up an external clock and cranked it up to the highest speed it would
work reliably at.

Also, I have done this with my Hayes modem.  The standard duration for
touchtone pulses is 70 ms.  The phone system here will accept as short
at 38 ms.

Subject: Risks of omissions

I had not intended to get involved in the RISKS Forum discussions, but
despite my great respect for John McCarthy's accomplishments, I just cannot
let his latest message (RISKS-1.8, Sept. 8) pass without comment.

Some important points that need to be considered:

1) Nothing is completely safe.  All activities and technologies involve
risk.  Getting out of bed is risky -- so is staying there.  Nitrates have
been shown to cause cancer -- not using them may mean that more people will
die of food poisoning.

2) Technology is often introduced for the mere sake of using the "latest,"
sometimes without considering the fact that the situation may not really be
improved.  For example, everybody seems to be assuming lately that machines
will make fewer mistakes than humans and there is a frantic rush to include
computers and "artificial intelligence" in every new product.  Where speed
is the determining factor, then they may be right.  Where intelligent
decision making in the face of unforeseen situations and factors is
foremost, then it may not be true.  Some electro-mechanical devices may be
more reliable than computers.  Since I am identified with the area of
"software safety," I am often consulted by those building safety-critical
software systems.  It is appalling how many engineers insist that computers
do not make "mistakes" and are therefore safer than any other human or
electro-mechanical system.  We (as computer scientists) have often been
guilty of condoning or even promoting this misconception.  Often it seems
that the introduction and use of non-scientific and misleading terminology
(e.g. "intelligent," "expert", "proved correct") has far outstripped the
introduction of new ideas.

3)  Technology introduced to decrease risk does not always result in 
increased safety.  For example, devices which have been introduced into
aircraft to prevent collisions have allowed reduced aircraft separation
with perhaps no net gain in safety (although there is a net gain in efficiency 
and profitability).  There may be certain risk levels that people are
willing to live with and introducing technological improvements to reduce
risks below these levels may merely allow other changes in the system which
will bring the risks up to these levels again.

4) Safety may conflict with other goals, e.g. productivity and efficiency.
Technology that focuses on these other goals may increase risk.

John McCarthy suggests that people ignore the risks of not using technology.
I would suggest that it is not that these risks are ignored, but that they
are known and we have learned to live with them while the risks of using new
technology are often unknown and may involve great societal upheaval in
learning to adapt to them.  Yes, wood smoke may cause lung cancer, but note
that recent studies in Great Britain show that the incidence of prostate
cancer in men who work in atomic power plants is many times that of the
general population.  To delay introducing technology in order to assure that
greater risks are not incurred than are currently borne by the population
seems justifiable.  Yes delay may cause someone's death, but the
introduction may cause even more deaths and disruption in the long-run.

The solution is to develop ways to assess the risks accurately (so that
intelligent, well-informed decision-making is possible) and to develop ways
to reduce the risk as much as possible.  Returning to the topic of computer
risk, citizens and government agencies need to be able to make informed
decisions about such things as the safety of fly-by-wire computer-controlled
commercial aircraft or between computer-controlled Air Traffic Control with
human-assistance vs. human-controlled Air Traffic Control with computer
assistance.  To do this, we need to be able to assess the risks and to
accurately state what computers can and cannot do.

Forums like this one help to disseminate important information and promote
the exchange of ideas, But we also need to start new initiatives in computer
science research and practice.  I have been writing and lecturing about this
for some time.  For example,

  1) we need to stop considering software reliability as a matter of
     counting bugs.  If we could eliminate all bugs, this would work.  But
     since we cannot at this time, we need to differentiate between the
     consequences of "software failures."

  2) Once you start to consider consequences of failures, then it is possible
     to develop techniques which will assess risk.  

  3) Considering consequences may affect more aspects of software than just
     assessment.  Some known techniques, such as formal verification and
     on-line monitoring, which are not practical to detect all faults may be
     applied in a cost-effective manner to subsets of faults.  Decisions may
     be able to be made about the use of competing methodologies in terms of
     the classes of faults that they are able to detect, remove, or tolerate.
     But most important, by stating the "software problem" in a different way 
     (in terms of consequences), it may be possible to discover new approaches
     to it.  My students and I have been working on some of these.  Most
     software methodologies involve a "forward" approach which attempts to
     locate, remove, or tolerate all software faults.  An alternative is to
     take a backward approach which considers the most serious failures and
     attempts to determine if and how they could occur and to protect the
     software from taking these actions.

If using some of these techniques (or despite their use), it is determined
that the software would be more risky than conventional systems or is above
a minimum level of acceptable risk, then we can present decision makers with
these facts and force them to consider them in the decision-making process.
Just citing horror stories or past mistakes is not enough.  We need ways of
assessing the risk of our systems (which may involve historical data
presented in a statistically proper manner) and ways to decrease that risk
as much as possible.  Then society can make intelligent decisions about
which systems should and should not be built for reasons of acceptable or
unacceptable risk.

The question of responsibilities for non-use of computers are largely
meaningless in terms of law unless the dangers of non-use were known to
substantially increase the probability of greater harm. In the case of your
three short examples:

(1) If the ACLU had acted in good faith in seeking to limit sharing of
police information and a court had looked favorably on their argument after
weighing the possible risks, then the court is responsible because only the
judge had the ability to decide between two courses of action. To make the
ACLU responsible would be to deny it and its point of view access to due
legal process. To make it necessary for the ACLU to anticipate the court's
response to its bringing suit would have the same chilling effect on our
legal system.

(2) The same argument applies to the Sierra Club and US 101.  If US 101 had
been built and then some people were killed, one could as easily conclude
that the Sierra Club (or anyone else) might be sued for NOT obstructing the
highway!

(3) The "Split Wood not Atoms" poster-vendor might be sued if it could be
conclusively proven that he was a knowing party to a conspiracy to give
people lung cancer. But we might assume that his motivation was actually to
prevent a devastating nuclear accident that might have given 10,000 people
lung cancer...

Again, a risks-of-computers organization can only present its case to court
and people and, so long as no malfeasance is involved, cannot be held
responsible for its failure to predict future consequences. There are far
more important "unsymmetric" relationships than that of the press vs. the
legal system that pertain to issues of responsibility, namely, that of past
vs. future and known vs. unknown. I feel that you are correct in pointing
out how computer people would do well to apply their expertise to solving
problems of society. In this case the moral imperitives are quite clear.

    	The problem with a forum on the risks of technology is that
    while the risks of not using some technology, e.g. computers, are
    real, it takes imagination to think of them....

You raise an interesting point that deserves more discussion.
However, as one who is concerned that the major problem arises from an
uncritical acceptance of technology, I strongly disagree with your
suggestion that the scales are stacked AGAINST those who are
"pro-technology".  The reason that anyone adopts any given technology
is that it provides benefits that he can see; the problem is getting
those individuals to see that there are costs as well.  In other
words, the bias in the system is towards acceptance of technology, not
rejection of it.  It is this general bias that "risks" people are
trying to correct.

    ...Is a risk-of-computers
    organization that successfully sues to delay a use of computers either
    MORALLY or LEGALLY LIABLE if the delay causes someone's death?  Is there
    any moral or legal requirement that such an organization prove that they
    have formally investigated whether their lawsuit will result in killing
    people?  As the above examples indicate, the present legal situation
    and the present publicity situation are entirely unsymmetric.

There are such precedents; organizations can be held liable for using
technology that that is not as up to date as is "generally
applicable".  On the more general point, it is much harder to
establish liability as the result of someone's inaction as compared to
the result of someone's action; this does happen, but it is harder to
prove. 

    The harm caused by tape-to-tape batch processing as opposed to on-line
    systems.

I like this example; let's have more discussion of it.  There was a
time when on-line systems were totally unreliable, but I think that
time has past.

    Shouldn't computer professionals
    who pretend to social responsibility take an interest in an
    area where their knowledge might actually be relevant?

This is a cheap shot unworthy of pioneers in computer science.  More
than anyone else, computer professionals are the ones who are in the
best position to assess the limits as well as the promises of
technology.  You once said that the responsibility of the scientist is
to take his science whereever it may lead.  I agreed with you then,
and I agree with that now.  But science is part of a social and
cultural context, and cannot be separated as cleanly as one might
imagine.  If it is proper for the developers of science and technology
to propose new applications of their work (because they see these
potential applications as beneficial to society), it is also
appropriate for them to suggest possible consequences of their use as
well.

Subject: Risks of omissions; Weizenbaum's message
ReSent-To: risks@SRI-CSLA.ARPA

1.  McCarthy's contribution can be summarized simply,  "Life is 
full of tough decisions about when to use technology; we have to
consider both sides."  Those who have been concerned with the risks
of computer technology have been saying, "There are risks to using
computer technology; we have to consider both sides".  I sense 
agreement on the obvious conclusion.

2.  I can disagree only with one aspect of Weizenbaum's contribution.
He says that he would be against SDI even if it would work, but his arguments
mainly show even more reasons why it won't "make nucelar weapons impotent
and obsolete."  It is probably useless to argue about how we would feel 
about the system if it would work, but I feel the decision would be much 
harder to make than it is now.

    While I would prefer not to waste technological resources on such a thing,
I would see some truth in the argument that the non-technological solutions 
also have a clear risk of failure.

Assuming, contrary to fact, that putting a faster clock
in your AT would cause it to catch fire, the RISKS contributors are
quite wrong about who would be sued.  According to the new legal
doctrine of  bursae profundae,  it isn't the poor BBOARD operator
that would have to pay but rich IBM.  It wouldn't take much of a lawyer
to figure out that IBM should have anticipated that someone might
do this and warned against it or even somehow made it impossible.

Changing the subject, consider the effect of the court decision that
NOAA was liable for not fixing the buoy.  Up to now weather predictions
have been offered as a non-guaranteed service with the user taking
responsibility for the extent to which he relies on it.  The court
has said that this is no longer possible.  Any institution with
"deep pockets" cannot safely offer information on a user responsibility
basis.  What if Stanford University has negligently failed to
replace a stolen book from its medical library, and someone dies
who would have been saved had his doctor found the book?  Stanford's
lawyers should advise Stanford to deny access to its medical library
to practicing physicians.

My primary complaint about your otherwise interesting table is that it
assumes independent failure modes.  I think it is much more likely
that the effects of coupled failures are larger.  In particular, given
the failure of one platform, it is more likely that more than one will
fail.

The example of squirreled non-printing characters is of course just 
one example; that one was relatively easy to fix once it was recognized. 
But until you have discovered a flaw, you are vulnerable.  And you never
know how many flaws remain undiscovered.

Sure, *you* may be smart, but large operating systems generally have many
security flaws.  *You* probably aren't smart enough to design and build a
system that has none.  (In fact, your solution is not quite good enough
by itself -- without some other assumptions on the rest of your system.)

    [By the way, let me add before someone comments, a message that causes
     grief when read would be a Trojan horse.  A message that propagates itself
     -- as in the case of the ARPANET collapse on 27 Oct 1980 -- would be
     a virus.  A BBOARD message that is innocently moved to another system 
     by third parties for others to get clobbered by has aspects of both --
     a virus-propagated Trojan horse .  PGN]

I certainly recognize that operating systems have security flaws in
them, having been an OS hacker myself at one time.  But for the
problem of messages (as opposed to programs) doing bad things to my
system, I guess I never figured out a way of doing that.

My naive model is that I have a special program that intercepts the
raw bit stream that comes in from my communications port.  It then
translates this into ASCII, and then prints it on my screen.  

If this is all that my program does, I can't see what harm can be
done.

Now, if my program writes the message to disk, then I can see
potential problems.  So I simply count the characters that are sent to
me over the line, and save exactly that many characters on disk.

What am I missing?

Herb, Indeed your model is a bit naive, in that you are looking at the
problem much to narrowly, and assuming that *everything* *else* works fine.
Suppose that your special program would work as you wish in intercepting the
raw bit stream.  Suppose, however, that there is an operating system flaw
that lets me change your special program to do what I wish! (There are many
examples of how this might happen.)  Now your program can be effectively
bypassed.  The point is NOT whether you can seal off one hole, but rather
that you are dealing with the tip of an iceberg and there may be titanic
holes you don't even know about.  Besides, as I said earlier, the message
squirreling is only one example -- and hopefully completely cured.  So I
hope you don't reply that you could use seals to guarantee that your program
is unchanged.  That would still miss the broader point.  PGN

Subject: McCarthy, Weizenbaum on SDI

Joseph Weizenbaum states that he would be against SDI "even if it worked."
I agree.  The premise that "IF the SDI could work, then we must have it (at
any price)" is naive.  It seems that many people are willing to accept that
premise hoping that it will anchor the discussion in the technical area.

One factor which is rarely addressed is that of intermediate systems which
the SDI will spawn.  There is a tendency to think of the SDI system as being
one big system that one day appears overhead as a whole, integrated system.
I have little doubt that the SDI plan includes many deliverables along the
way.  These intermediate systems will both be arguably non-defensive and
pose a large problem for integration.  I.e., the system must not only be
trustworthy when "fully deployed" but at a multitude of intermediate steps.
Thus risks will exist in advance of the full delivery (if there ever is to
be one).

Another factor is the so-called defensiveness of the system.  If two people
are armed with guns and one suddenly dons a bullet proof vest this act will
be perceived as an offensive act.

Pro-SDI people almost always accuse SDI critics of being politically
motivated.  Given the immense (and possibly impossible) technical task of
getting the system to work, and the guarenteed proliferation of offensive
weapons (designed to penetrate the system), it is very, very difficult for
me to believe that the pro SDI folk are not motivated primarily from
political (and economic!!) grounds.

To quote from RISKS Vol 1 #8:
    2.  I can disagree only with one aspect of Weizenbaum's contribution.
    He says that he would be against SDI even if it would work, but his
    arguments mainly show even more reasons why it won't "make nucelar weapons 
    impotent and obsolete."  It is probably useless to argue about how we
    would feel about the system if it would work, but I feel the decision
    would be much harder to make than it is now. [Dave Parnas]

I think this touches on the crux of the matter: what problem is SDI meant to
solve?  If we could guarantee that SDI would not only "make nuclear weapons
impotent and obsolete", but would in fact reduce the risks associated with
war (not necessarily the same thing) then I would not be against SDI.
However, I argue (and I suspect this is Weizenbaum's point, too) that an SDI
that worked according to the current specification would actually increase
risks, even though the system performed "flawlessly".

This is not the place to discuss the strategic implications of SDI, but I
think it's important to realize that there are those of us who believe both
that SDI is not likely to meet its current specification, nor that it would
be a good idea even if it did.

    [I] would see some truth in the argument that the non-technological
    solutions also have a clear risk of failure.  [Parnas]

I am afraid that there is no failure-proof solution, technological or not,
to the problem of "war".  John McCarthy is right that we must compare
the risks of the technological solution (e.g., SDI) to its non-use.  My
fear is that, in this case, the problem is not that the use of technology
might fail to solve the problem, but that it might actually make things
worse.

There has been some discussion of comparing alternative risks on the
RISKS mailing list lately. For example, what is the risk associated
with the introduction of a new technology versus not introducing the
technology? Risk assessment and risk management need not be
"guesstimates" nor "a number picked out of the air."

The insurance industry has had to assess and manage risks for years.
In fact, they have made quite a science out of these two areas. I
would recommend that those who wish to find out more about risk
management and risk assessment read:

   RISK MANAGEMENT AND INSURANCE, Fourth Edition, by C. Arthur
   Williams, Jr. and Richard M. Heins, McGraw-Hill, 1981.

Don't let the title put you off. Virtually the entire book is
dedicated to risk management, with only a few pages on insurance. You
will also find that there are entire professional societies dedicated
to managing and assessing risk, e.g., the American Risk and Insurance
Association and the Risk and Insurance Management Society.

    From: Herb Lin &lt;LIN@MIT-MC.ARPA&gt;

    My naive model is that I have a special program that intercepts the
    raw bit stream that comes in from my communications port.  It then
    translates this into ASCII, and then prints it on my screen.  

    If this is all that my program does, I can't see what harm can be done.

Several kinds of terminals are programmable from the host, in that
certain escape sequences can be sent to them to get them to perform
actions such as defining the terminal's function keys.

If a user inserts the appropriate escape sequences in a mail message
to his system manager, or into a file which will be displayed by the
manager, when the manager reads that mail message it will reprogram
a function key on the manager's terminal, which the manager may have
programmed to do some common harmless function, to instead do some
other command such as give the user unauthorized privileges.

This is a fairly well known bug, and many mail systems are now
protected against it, in that they will not transmit any control
characters or escape sequences to the terminal.

The moral is that there are many subtle ways to break security,
and even things that seem to be quite safe may not really be.

With <A HREF="/Risks/1.45.html">RISKS-1.45</A>, my MM saturated completely on its ability to cope with all
of the Volume 1 issues of the RISKS Forum (at 289 pages) in one .TXT file,
so it must be time to start Volume 2! Thus, let me take this opportunity to
review the six months since RISKS Volume 1 Issue 1, on 1 August 1985.

The SDI pallaver seems to have overwhelmed some of you, but it has opened up
some serious problems -- as does the unreleased Eastport Report, which is
perhaps most interesting for what it does not cover! (You may have concluded
that SDI is a religious issue that cannot be decided rationally?)  The Space
Shuttle tragedy also opens up all sorts of questions on how much trust we
can place in technology and what the risks are -- although those questions
have been around all along.  They are simply elevated to a higher level of
public awareness now (temporarily?).  For example, the issue of the safety
of self-destruct mechanisms has been lurking, and is clearly a concern in
general -- but is only one concern.  There are lots of others.  We must
remember that risks come many sources -- not just from maliciousness and
accidents, but also from unforeseen combinations of problems.

So far we have addressed many important issues, although some of them quite
superficially.  We have overlapped on occasions with ARMS-D, Soft-Eng, and
Security distributions.  However, it seems that RISKS does provide a focus
that cuts across these other mailings, and that it serves a useful purpose
-- particularly when it indeed focuses on the risks to the public.

A few platitudes are in order:

  No system is ever going to be 100% guaranteed all of the time,
  especially if it runs standalone.  Even with humans in the loop, 
  humans can make mistakes -- especially in real-time.

  Risks may come from unexpected directions.  A system that has run
  perfectly may still suddenly malfunction.  Hardware may fail.  Bugs may
  remain undetected for years, and suddenly become activated.  Besides,
  software may age poorly, especially if changes somewhere else interfere
  with old working software.

  The operating environment may contain risks that undermine sound design,
  impementation, and operations.

  The notion that all critical concerns -- security, reliability, etc. --
  can be confined to a small portion of a computer system or distributed 
  system (e.g., a kernel) is a fantasy, particularly with conventionally
  designed systems.  

  The notion that distributed control solves problems that cannot easily be
  solved with central control is also often a myth -- problems of updating,
  synchronization, concurrency, backup, verifiability, etc., may be equally
  severe in many operating environments.

  Lowest-bidder efforts are intrinsically risky.  Commercial software is
  commonly far behind the state of the art.  That may be an advantage in
  some cases (!), but is often detrimental.  But there are significant
  benefits to be gained from using certain software engineering techniques.

  There are inherent risks in using computer systems in critical
  environments.  These must be continually reexamined.  Critical and open
  discussion of critical systems and critical environments is essential.
  We as technologists must better understand the risks and their implications.
  And we must apply that increased understanding to new developments.

And now, a word from our sponsor: This forum was established at the request
of the Association for Computing Machinery, and chartered as an activity of
the ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy (of which I am the
chairman).  However, the opinions reflected herein do not constitute an
endorsement by the ACM.  On the other hand, if I screw up and do something
the ACM does not like, I probably lose my (volunteer) job.

As a summary of some of the problems that have occurred, and as a possible
inspiration for undiscussed areas of concern or areas of hope, I include in
this issue an update of the disaster list that those of you who have been
with us since the beginning saw in Vol 1 No 1.

In response to an off the cuff remark by an unnamed physicist, Sean Malloy
writes, "Too many scientists over history have declared something impossible
or impractical that is commonplace today to reject some line of research
because of such pronouncements."  It is equally true that, too many
scientists over history have declared to be possible or practical something
that was later found to be impossible or impractical to pursue some line of 
research or development because of such pronouncements."  There have been 
countless schemes to build perpetual motion machines, faster than light
transport, 600 user time-sharing systems, world champion chess programs,
unbreakable codes, impregnable forts, unsinkable ships, etc. etc.  

We cannot reject a negative prediction simply because earlier negative
predictions have been wrong just as we cannot reject a positive prediction
simply because earlier positive predictions have been wrong.  To have
credence any prediction must be supported by detailed argumentation.  If
nobody can produce a convincing refutation of that argumentation, it is
foolish not to act on the prediction.  I would not support any effort to build
faster than light rockets until someone shows me the flaw in Einstein's 
reasoning.  Any researchers who hope to execute the following algorithm,
"for I:=1 step 1 until 10,000 do `build rocket with n stages using DoD
funding' should begin with a serious study of relativity, not with an SDI
proposal to build a national totem pole center.

Thanks for the digest of the digest. In following Risks from day to
day, it was easy to lose sight of the general principles illustrated by
all the specific cases and discussions. I guess that I would add to
your list just one more generalization, concerning our ability to predict
failures:

  If a system is complex, it is practically impossible to predict its
  sources of catastrophic failure. This is especially true in well-
  engineered systems, since good engineers make allowance for the
  problems that they foresee.

&gt; If you are into pure, unadulterated speculation, another possibility

&gt; lodged there.  When the fuel burned to that point, a jet leaked out,
&gt; and triggered an explosion.

Alas for this particular speculation, the SRB fuel burns outward from the
booster axis rather than upward along the booster.  Combustion starts from
a hole running the full length of the axis, and reaches the outer casing
only at the very end of the burn.  There may well be a few places near the
ends where casing is progressively uncovered -- I don't have drawings at
hand to check on this -- but this imposes much more severe constraints on
aim.  All in all, it seems implausible.  All the more so because the SRBs
continued on after the explosion, reasonably intact with no signs of any
marked side thrust or substantial extraneous exhaust jets.

I heard on CNN last night that one of the latest theories about the
cause of the shuttle accident is that flames from a leak in an SRB may
have set off the explosives which are part of the ET self-destruct
mechanism. Not knowing anything about explosives, this seems plausible
to me. 

On the other hand, PBS interviewed someone last night (the editor of an
aviation magazine, I believe) who said that a fuel leak in an SRB would
have probably caused it to immediately stray wildly from its previous
trajectory, but that the video of the launch seems to show both of them
continuing on in the same general direction after the explosion. I
believe that Range Safety did not destroy the SRBs until about 20
seconds after the explosion.

A submission in RISKS-2.2 was concerned about a Stratus-like comparator
mechanism being a single point of failure in the Space Shuttle's operations.
However, the space shuttle's redundant set doesn't use a comparator
mechanism.  Instead, the actuators are controlled by a hydraulic
"force-fight" mechanism, with each computer sending independent commands on
independent buses.  If one computer of four fails, the other three can exert
enough force to overpower its (presumably bad) commands.  If this pressure
differential persists for long enough, the overpowered one is hydraulically
bypassed.

For more details, see "Case Study: The Space Shuttle Primary Computer System"
by Al Spector and Dave Gifford in CACM 27 #9 (September 1984).

    The point is as follows:  If pacemakers are designed to handle stresses
    such as that I would assume that the satellites are designed much better,
    especially since the Soviets dumped a load on Canada (did they ever pay
    damages for that?).

Bad assumption.  The physics of materials tells us that in general,
big things are weak and small things are strong -- relatively
speaking.  The influence that holds things together is an area effect
-- the tensile strength in materials.  The force that breaks things
apart depends on gravity, a volume effect.  As the object gets larger,
the gravity induced stress grows faster than the tensile stresses.
That's why it's harder to break a small clump of ice than a big one.

The Soviet ultimately paid about 1/5 the cleanup costs.

   From TV-news coverage, I have the impression as if there might not
   have been adequate attention paid to icing which is supposed to
   have occurred this morning on the launch-pad.

My understanding was that the shuttle launch was delayed for more than
an hour due to the icing.  Since they delayed the launch specifically
because of the weather, I strongly doubt that they would have delayed
it for too short a period (if they are going to be yelled at by the
media for being overly cautious, then they might as well delay for the
full required time).

Sun, 2 Feb 86 14:08:17 est
</i><PRE>

Odd topic for a computer centered forum - but worth discussing a bit.  The
computer hook relates to what could have been monitored, detected, and reac-
ted to in computer time; but not in human time.  I base this discussion on
long-ago experience in writing about solid propellant rockets, plus Sunday's
TV &amp; radio news.

1.  Solid propellants burn at a surface.  If they are designed to burn at one
end, they are called "cigarette burning."  If they are designed to burn 
through a hole in the middle, they are not.  The prepared hunk of propellant 
is called a "grain."  

2.  Cigarette burning produces roughly constant propelling force throughout 
the burn.  Chunks of loose propellant (cylinders, spheres, etc.) produce more
thrust at the beginning, less at the end, as the surface area of the grains is
reduced/consumed.

3.  The hole in the center of a grain can be tailored in shape to affect burn
characteristics just about any way the engineer wants.  In addition, "inhibi-
tors" can be put on the grain to further control its burn characteristics.

4.  In most boosters the grain fills the container, except for the hole in the
center, and a space near the nozzle.  An ignitor (actually, another small 
rocket) is usually at the end opposite the nozzle. 

5.  Remember, the grain burns at the surface.  A crack in the grain provides
another surface to burn.  If the grain separates from the casing, the 
exterior of the grain provides another burning surface.  If the grain is 
sectional, i.e. too large to build as one unit, the ends of the sections can
provide burning surfaces.  Naturally, it is the engineer's job to control and
prevent these undesirable burning surfaces, and to produce the thrust profile
required for the task at hand. 

(tutorial ends, speculation begins)

It is my understanding that "SRBs" were built in 6 sections, and assembled
on-site. Nose, 4 grain sections (not necessarily identical, the hole can be
tapered), and tail.  I also understand that the casing sections were "bolted"
together (probably a fairly complex bolting system); and were considered to 
be quite safe &amp; reliable.  The casings were recovered after a launch, refurb-
ished, reloaded, &amp; re-used.

Recently released film, computer-enhanced offline, after the accident, show
that the right hand SRB had a plume coming out the side, in a location that
appeared to me to be about where the joint between the 3rd and 4th grain/
casing sections would be - but, depending on the actual design, could have
been further aft, near the end of the grain, towards the nozzle.  If this 
was a casing/grain burn-through, the mildest result would be assymetric 
thrust.  *This should have been immediately detectable by the guidance system's
reaction in attempting to maintain the desired trajectory.*  If similar per-
terbations occurred in wind shears, etc., it might not be recognizable as
abnormal. 

Another result could be that the errant jet impinged on the main fuel tank,
heating, penetrating, and igniting the fuel load. (It might be able to ignite
it without penetrating the tank structure.)  *This should be quickly detec-
table by excursions in tank pressure.*  Reaction times, even of computers, 
might not be fast enough to make any difference in the outcome.

I believe that both of the above could have been detected with instrumentation
that was certainly on board.  Additional (or existing?) instrumentation could
detect temperature changes in SRB and fuel tank skins, torques on SRB mounts,
abnormal "seismic" vibrations within the SRB structure, abnormal "plumes",
etc.  

It is so easy to second-guess.  I am sure the engineers concerned are casti-
gating themselves for what they failed to forsee, for what they concluded was
trivial, for what now seems eminently clear to them.  I wish they would quit it.
The whole program is so full of checks and balances that only a Higher Power
could add more.  From "MTM's" description of the safety system, it seems a 
miracle that it was possible to destroy the SRBs under normal circumstances,
much less in the middle of disaster.  The astronauts participated in the design
and manufacturing process - they were ready to go.

We have lost seven of our best and brightest.  But perhaps we are seven closer
to whatever is out there in space, waiting for us to get on with it, get out
there, fulfill our dreams.

Peter: this is too long, but I had to write it, tell someone.  I went into 
space in the '50s, with Heinlein and Bonestell.  The Challenger Seven must 
not be regarded as sacrifices on the altar of science - they were just seven
of us who went a little closer to the edge of knowledge than the rest of us
dare.  The human/computer symbiosis will get us out there eventually, and
the Challenger Seven will have helped every one who follows them. - Mike

First, I assume that everyone knows that no atomic explosion would
occur under any circumstances.  Nor any fallout.

That only leaves the actual radioactive fuel itself.  Plutonium's
danger, for a constant mass, depends upon the size of the particles.
The worse thing that can happen is for dust size particles to be
inhaled.  Large chunks would be a local danger, but one easily
handled.  Note that if the launch was from the Cape, then it would
eventually settle into the ocean.  This would aid considerably in
dispersing it to extremely low concentrations.  Finally, remember that
the Soviets lost a satellite powered by radioactives over Canada.
While the Canadians were not happy, and took clean up measures, the
real problem was getting the Soviets to pony up for the cleanup costs.

    .... Therefore, aside from several hundred pounds of plutonium ...

Are you sure about your numbers?  Hundreds of pounds of pure
plutonium?  The cost would be outrageous.  Moreover, this implies a
total mass would be thousands of pounds, if not tons (since the
plutonium would be diluted to a lower concentration and sufficient
shielding for the electronics would have to be provided).  Maybe you
mean a fuel assembly massing hundreds of pounds?  If so, then the
actual mass of Plutonium would be a small fraction of the total mass.

One aspect of the SRB self-destruct mechanism which has bothered me the
most is the fact that a single action will destroy BOTH SRB's (and perhaps
the external tank as well?).  It is clear that recovery of the intact
casings would have been invaluable in the NASA investigation.  News reports
tell us that one of the SRB's was headed on a dangerous course toward
popluated areas and had to be destroyed.  Fair enough.  But why destroy
the other one unless and until it was also proved necessary??

Thinking about this further reveals it may not be that simple.  First of
all, I can imagine scenarios in which both SRB's would need to be destroyed
as quickly as possible, especially in the early phases of the launch.  You
would certainly want to have a mechanism for doing this as exists now.
On the other hand, last Tuesday's events show that it would be very
valuable to be able to destroy them individually as well.  This would imply
modifying the hardware/software such that each SRB responded to two sets
of tones: a common set for both and an individual set.  Perhaps a simpler
scheme would be to simply have two different frequencies which could be
used simultaneously or separately.

Those of us discussing this were momentarily satsified until somebody
asked, "Yes, but how do you tell which SRB is which??!"  In this case, it
was reasonably easy to answer that question when they emerged from the 
fireball, but this might not always be the case.  Furthermore, it's not
clear that the task would be any easier when watching them on a radar
screen.  (What does the Range Safety Officer use?)  This difficulty
can presumably be overcome by electronic equipment on each SRB that would
tag its radar image in some fashion.

I'm wondering if this is a case of "good hindsight", or if there are
other considerations we didn't think of.

&gt; - Quebec election prediction gave loser big win [1981] (SEN 10 2, p. 25-26)

Election monitoring software for two television networks was faulty: votes
were being attributed to the wrong candidates.  Names were being kept
in alphabetical order while votes were kept in decreasing order.
This is a language related bug: the contractor was IP Sharp and the
software was programmed in APL -- the informations ended up in distinct

 &gt;Subject:  SRBs and What the Computers Should Monitor 

 &gt;Another result could be that the errant jet impinged on the main fuel tank,
 &gt;heating, penetrating, and igniting the fuel load. (It might be able to ignite
 &gt;it without penetrating the tank structure.)  *This should be quickly detec-
 &gt;table by excursions in tank pressure.*  Reaction times, even of computers, 
 &gt;might not be fast enough to make any difference in the outcome.

&gt;I believe that both of the above could have been detected with instrumentation
 &gt;that was certainly on board.  Additional (or existing?) instrumentation could
 &gt;detect temperature changes in SRB and fuel tank skins, torques on SRB mounts,
 &gt;abnormal "seismic" vibrations within the SRB structure, abnormal "plumes",
 &gt;etc.  

One of the points that was brought up during the broadcasts the day of the
disaster was that the telemetry tapes were going to have to be analyzed to
determine if there was any indication as to what happened.  The temperature
data for the external tank was specifically mentioned as one of the
telemetry streams that was NOT fed to a display in either the launch control
area or Mission Control. The NASA spokesman explained that there was so much
information coming in that a decision had to be made to limit what the
launch control personnel had to pay attention to.

This brings up a much more subtle problem in risk evaluation -- what data is
considered relevant to the task at hand? A line has to be drawn between
significant and extraneous data, based on the processing capacity of the
system/personnel interpreting the data. NASA had decided that the ET
temperatures were not of immediate use to the launch control personnel, and
simply recorded the data.  In the previous 24 shuttle launches, they were
right; in this case, they were wrong. In the future, they probably will have
someone monitoring that data. What also has to be considered in the decision
is what can be done on the basis of a given stream of data. I don't know how
long the ET temperatures would have been elevated before the explosion, so I
don't know whether there would have been time to recognize the problem,
identify the source, and jettison the SRBs. If you can show that there won't
be enough time to react properly, then giving someone responsibility for
making the right decision in that situation is asking someone to volunteer
to have a nervous breakdown.

In retrospect, there should have been immediate scrutiny of the SRB
performance. Looking at the pictures of the exhaust trails after the
explosion, one of the SRBs is looping away from the blast apparently
undamaged, while the trail from the other proceeds straight for a
short distance, then peters out abruptly. Why would one survive
unscathed while the other one was badly damaged unless something
happened with or adjacent to the SRB? Hindsight is always 20/20.

  &gt;  If this [new plume]
  &gt;was a casing/grain burn-through, the mildest result would be assymetric 
  &gt;thrust.  *This should have been immediately detectable by the guidance
  &gt;system's reaction in attempting to maintain the desired trajectory.*  If
  &gt;similar pert[u]rbations occurred in wind shears, etc., it might not be
  &gt;recognizable as abnormal. 

In fact, the shuttle was just passing out of an area where wind shear is
common.  If you look at the trail that was left, there appears to be a sharp
jog just before the plume enters the base of the fireball cloud, suggesting
either wind shear or perhaps the thrust from the extra hole.  It's also
possible that the thrust from the spurious plume would be too small to be
noticed (which I believe is in this case a matter of several percent).

  &gt;Another result could be that the errant jet impinged on the main fuel tank,
      [... see above message ...]

Judging from the film, this seems unlikely, although localized overheating
could have occured and caused a failure.

  &gt;Those of us discussing this were momentarily satsified until somebody
  &gt;asked, "Yes, but how do you tell which SRB is which??!"  ...

Actually, the shuttle is within visual range throughout the SRB boost phase,
if I remember correctly.  The two boosters could be distinguished by
painting a different roll pattern on each.

As far as risks are concerned, I think that the one point of all of this is
to illustrate the value of collecting data even if you can't immediately use
it to determine what to do.  There seems to be a consensus, for instance,
that temperature readings on the ET and the removed sensors on the SRBs were
useless under normal circumstances.  It was immediately apparent how
valuable they would be in illuminating the failure that did finally occur.
It will be interesting to see if NASA's philosophy changes as a result of
the accident.

That both SRB's survived, while the shuttle didn't, makes me wonder how the 
structural integrity of the SRB's differed from the shuttle in allowing
them to survive the explosion.

I believe someone asked about the security out at the Cape, I have some good
first hand knowledge about it.  I have been to over a half dozen launches
and/or attempted launches at the Cape, and I worked there for a few months
as a Contractor during a few launches.  A few days before a launch the Air
Force closes off the beaches north of the Cape for a good distance (over 3
miles) as well as some of the beaches south of the Cape.  I believe they try
to keep visitors away from the launch site at a distance of about 4 miles,
which is is how far away you see the launch if you get a car pass from Nasa.
The press and VIP's sit only 2.3 miles from the launch pad, and they have a
hard time from the guards getting there (I once viewed the launch from
here).  Also, planes are allowed in a restricted air space around the Cape,
but you are still a good distance from the launch itself, and with Air Force
jets patrolling the area to make sure of this.

On launch days when I worked at the Cape, I usually had my car searched,
and a few times they put in spot check points to make sure no one was going
where they weren't supposed to.  At every launch the security I felt was
very good, but I guess there is always somewhere where there could be 
a place where someone could get in undetected, it is a big place.

   Larry Shilkoff observed in RISKS 1-45 that future shuttle missions have
(or maybe had) been planned to carry plutonium-powered spacecraft, the
Galileo probe in particular.  Had Challenger carried such a spacecraft,
Southern Florida would have been exposed to substantial plutonium fallout.

   This brings up a similar issue with the Strategic Defense Initiative.  In
a recent Forum article in New Scientist (16 January 1986), physicist Raymond
Harwell considered the after-effects of a *successful* interception of
Soviet ICBM boosters.  He looked at the levels of radioactive fallout that
would ensue from the return to Earth of disabled ICBMs and their warheads.
Quoting from his article:

  Some simple calculations indicate the likely consequences of SDI
  interceptions of Soviet ICBMs.  A Soviet first strike could involve the
  simultaneous launching of some 5000 nuclear warheads at targets in the US.
  If only 20 percent of these warheads, each containing 10 kg of plutonium
  239, are disintegrated (without a nuclear explosion) in the northern
  hemisphere, about 10^13 lethal doses (if inhaled or ingested) of
  alpha-emitting plutonium would be released -- about 5,000 doses per person
  in the northern hemisphere.  If that radioactive debris were distributed
  uniformly, there would be one lethal dose for every 25 square metres of the
  northern hemisphere.  Not all the radioactive material will have immediate
  effects on Earth but, however delayed the fallout of stratospheric plutonium
  might be, its long half-life (24,000 years) would ensure its eventual
  arrival at altitudes likely to be occupied by human beings, other animals
  and plants.

   Most of the technical discussion of the risks in deploying the SDI has
focussed on its failure modes.  Harrowell's analysis brings up another face
of the problem, namely that the success mode of the system may be so
narrowly defined as to ensure significant, if not unacceptable, risks --
whether the system succeeds or fails.

   The regrettable lesson, is that success of an engineering
application, if defined overly narrowly, may not be success at all.

Naturally I was somewhat interested in Lamy's comments on the Quebec
election (1981) and I.P. Sharp's role.  I was only marginally aware of the
details involved and thought I should check the facts. 
                                                   [Dan is at IPSharp.  PGN]
Lamy is essentially accurate in his comments. His message does,
however, seem to indicate that there was an error in the APL language
interpreter. Such was not the case -- it was a programming error.
A case could possibly be made that the programming styles that have developed
around the APL notation led to the resulting situation. (But there
are always penalties that arise from using any notation...)

At the same time over the past weekend, SCRIBE stopped working on several
(but not all) SRI computer systems.  There was some sort of accidental
latent time-bomb in the UNILOGIC software (other than the expected annual
crypto-lock time-bomb that goes off annually to prevent people from merrily
copying SCRIBE and using it indefinitely or without paying their dues).
This is a fine example of software that has always worked suddenly no longer
working.

The following is excerpted from this Sunday's New York Times.  It may
be somewhat old news to some, but does a good job of summarizing much of
the evidence and arguments surrounding the Challenger's computers.

           SHUTTLE EXPERTS DOUBT COMPUTERS COULD DETECT FIRE
                           By David E. Sanger

   The computers and sensors that guided the flight of the space shuttle
Challenger appear not to have been programmed to detect flames burning
throught the sides of a solid-fuel booster rocket, experts familiar with the
shuttle system said yesterday.

   Their comments came as evidence accumulated that the right-side booster
began to fail as much as 10 seconds before the explosion that destroyed the
craft, as reported yesterday in the New York Times.

   Even if the sensors had picked up the first signs of fire, safety
measures built into the system to protect the astronauts would have
prevented the shedding of the giant external fuel tank that exploded soon
after, NASA officials and the computers' designers said.

                            Only From Pilot

   That command could have come only from the pilot, and officials said they
doubted even that could have saved the crew.
   ...
   Experts who have studied the shuttle's computer system say it was not
programmed to separate the orbiter automatically from its fuel supply in
part because of the fears that faulty sensor readings could cause the
computers to abort a mission unnecessarily, risking the lives of the crew.

                      Preparation for Emergencies

   Still the possibility that there were signs of trouble as long as 10
seconds before the explosion raised some questions yesterday about the
enormously complex equipment that guides the shuttle.
   ...
   "The possibility that a booster might burn through could well have
been a failure mode that was never considered," said Alfred Spector, a
Carnegie-Mellon professor who two years ago conducted a study of the
computer system guiding the shuttle.

   NASA officials said little publicly in response to the report that
data sent from the shuttle showed a sudden drop in the power of the
right booster rocket about 10 seconds before the spacecraft exploded.

   But computer experts said the computer's response to such a power drop
may have been executed flawlessly.  The program, they said, was primarily
designed to correct for the effects of an uneven rocket thrust by swiveling
engine nozzles to the side, keeping the shuttle on course.  Sources close to
the situation say that the ground data show that the nozzles had in fact
swiveled to one side.

   In the absence of other danger signals, however, the computer would not
have searched for the cause of the power loss.  And the initial signals
apparently indicated only a 4 percent decrease in thrust, a figure that the
computer, or the cabin crew and officials at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston, may have judged did not indicate a serious problem.
   ...

From: Mike Iglesias &lt;iglesias@UCI.EDU&gt;

According to this morning's LA Times:

 - Early shuttle flights had sensors on the SRBs to monitor performance,
   but they were removed to save weight when it was felt that the SRBs
   were performing well.  The sensors monitored pressure, temperature
   and vibration in the SRBs.

 - Two Rockwell officials familiar with the NASA inquiry said that NASA
   data shows that the 3 main engines experienced a power loss just
   before the explosion.  The power loss was noted between one-tenth and
   one-one hundreth of a second before the explosion.  The SRB that
   probably caused the explosion suffered a 3% loss of power (about
   100,000 pounds of thrust) seconds before.

 - NASA noted that even if there were sensors on the SRBs, little can 
   be done to save the crew if there is a problem during the first 2
   minutes during the flight.  They might be able to jettison the SRBs,
   but it would be difficult to stay clear of them and the external
   tank.  And another NASA spokesman said later that the crews don't
   train for that maneuver, and that NASA documents state that such
   an escape is possible only after the SRBs have completed firing.
   The shuttle would have a near-impossible task of ditching in the
   ocean if it was able to steer clear of the SRBs and the ET.

 - Other Rockwell sources said that telemetry shows that the external
   tank experienced an increase in pressure in both the oxygen and
   hydrogen tanks, and that pressure relief valves in both tanks 
   popped to decrease some of the pressure.

Could the crew have survived had they known about the problem?  Who knows?
Maybe, if they had known about the SRB problem in time, if they had been 
able to get away from the SRBs and the ET, and been able to ditch successfully
in the ocean.  That's a lot of ifs...

I wonder if NASA is going to think twice about removing sensors after this...

[Re Marty Schoffstall, on plutonium batteries for pacemakers and satellites:]

Note that the Soviet satellites use reactors, not isotope capsules, as
their power sources.  The two are quite different, especially in this
context.  It's not practical to encapsulate a reactor the way the isotope
capsules are armored against possible accidents.

[Re Larry Shilkoff, on Galileo:]

The capsules used to hold plutonium 238 (note that this is not the
fissionable isotope used in reactors and bombs) for deep-space power
sources are designed to withstand uncontrolled re-entry, and I think
to withstand launch accidents as well.  Quite likely they would have
survived intact.  There have been a few re-entries of satellites carrying
such capsules, and one went into the Pacific with the lunar module of
Apollo 13.  No dire results.

[Re James Tomayko, on Centaur aboard shuttle:]

Apart from the volatility, this is nothing new:  major solid-fuel motors
routinely ride in the cargo bay.  Those things are dangerous too.  People
doing some of the amateur-satellite work have estimated that the paperwork
needed to clear a satellite for a ride in the shuttle cargo bay roughly
triples if it is carrying any substantial rocket motor, solid or liquid.

&gt; Worse yet, Galileo was to be the
&gt; &lt;first&gt; user of the new upperstage, which shares little with its predecessor
&gt; except the name. It has new tanks, engines, and instrumentation...

Not quite true:  the Ulysses solar-polar mission, using the same upper
stage, was to launch about a week before Galileo.  Still awfully tight.

&gt; [in an abort] what are the dangers of trying to land with a full load of 
&gt; hydrogen and radioactive isotopes? ...

Actually, although the liquid hydrogen is what everyone points at, the
liquid oxygen is probably the greater danger.  "Stages to Saturn", the NASA
history of the Saturn boosters, commented that liquid hydrogen hazards were
found to be comparable to those of highly-volatile gasoline (not trivial,
mind you!), while it was liquid oxygen that really needed extraordinary
handling precautions.

[Re: Jeff Siegal on NASA/KSC physical security:]

It's not conspicuous, but it's there.  Practically nothing is said about
it in public.  I was down at the Cape for the 41C launch, on the National
Space Institute tour.  We got (I think) a slightly closer look at things
than the ordinary KSC tours, but when we went past the actual active pad
a day or two before launch we were cautioned that (a) the bus could slow
down but it must not stop, and (b) all windows, including the driver's
little vent window, must stay 100% shut.  With a strong indication that
we were being watched and our NASA guide would be in deep guano if either
rule was violated even momentarily.  We went past some press folks setting
up cameras, and our guide commented "if you're wondering why they're allowed
out of their bus and you aren't, it's because they've been searched and you
haven't".  The pad area proper also has an impressive concentration of
things like concertina wire (think of it as industrial-strength barbed wire)
around its perimeter.  It's difficult for a non-professional to evaluate
the quality of the precautions, but they did seem to be taking it seriously.

I have since heard a rumor that there were some awkward and hushed-up
incidents quite early in the Shuttle program that caused considerable
tightening of the original fairly loose security.

If we're going to talk about SDI and WWIII rather than computers,
please, let us at least use responsible analysis. Vilain quotes

  Some simple calculations indicate the likely consequences of SDI
  interceptions of Soviet ICBMs.  A Soviet first strike could involve the
  simultaneous launching of some 5000 nuclear warheads at targets in the US.
  If only 20 percent of these warheads, each containing 10 kg of plutonium
  239, are disintegrated (without a nuclear explosion) in the northern
  hemisphere, about 10^13 lethal doses (if inhaled or ingested) of
  alpha-emitting plutonium would be released -- about 5,000 doses per person
  in the northern hemisphere.  If that radioactive debris were distributed
  uniformly, there would be one lethal dose for every 25 square metres of the
  northern hemisphere.  Not all the radioactive material will have immediate
  effects on Earth but, however delayed the fallout of stratospheric plutonium
  might be, its long half-life (24,000 years) would ensure its eventual 
  arrival at altitudes likely to be occupied by human beings, other animals
  and plants.

This arithmetic [of?] "simple calculations" is irrelevant.  The "if"s are
totally bogus.

Every year, the US spreads about one fatal-dose per person of Arsenic
Trioxide onto food-plants via crop-dusters. And how many fatal doses of
salt does Connecticut spread on the roads every winter?

If you believe the quote, everyone in the northern hemisphere is already
dead (more than one fatal dose per person) from the atmospheric bomb
tests of the '50s and 60's.

    From: Marc Vilain &lt;MVILAIN at G.BBN.COM&gt;

       This brings up a similar issue with the Strategic Defense Initiative.  

      If that radioactive debris were distributed uniformly, there would be 
      one lethal dose for every 25 square metres of the northern hemisphere.

Bad assumption.  Most of boost-phase intercept occurs over the Soviet Union. 

       The regrettable lesson, is that success of an engineering
    application, if defined overly narrowly, may not be success at all.

This general point is well-taken, despite my comments above.  As they
say, "The operation was a success but the patient died."

I thought the following incident fits into RISKS.  Recently one of our
people moved from our Philadelphia corporate headquarters site
(thousands of employees) to our new Atlanta Development Center (only
dozen or so on board at the time.)  He sent the appropriate change of
address notifications into the publishers of his professional journals.
("change my address, P.O.  Box xyz, Blue Bell, Pa., to P.O.  Box qrs,
Norcross, Ga.", or words close to that.)  Shortly thereafter our poor
office secretary and part-time mail clerk down there was inundated with
mountains of journals from one of those publishers.  We don't know
exactly what happened, but apparently the software used to maintain the
circulation list was instructed, and dutifully did so, to "change all
addresses that match" (which, I guess, would be used to move a
household) rather than "change this particular subscriber record":
every single journal by that publisher addressed to our corporate
headquarters (modulo spelling variations, I presume) had by a handful of
keystrokes been redirected elsewhere.  The publisher involved shall
remain nameless (not ACM, that would make too nice a story) but it was
one dealing with the computer field.  The problem appears to have been
fixed, naturally the fix taking the usual "six weeks", whereas the
original error, naturally, happened in a couple of days.

Although this is a very sad event, it would be sadder if we would refuse to
learn from it.

Seven people were killed in this disaster, and billions of dollars of
equipment, but the rest of us will survive. The lesson is the limit of faith
we should put into our technology. I believe we should continue, that in
many ways we have been too cautious and should heed the pioneering spirit we
all feel, even if the pioneers put themselves at risk. Individuals should be
allowed to risk something to gain something, they should be encouraged,
applauded and honored for their sacrifices, if need be.

It is quite another thing to think that such systems can be relied upon
to end the current nuclear nightmare, that in these technologies we
will find strengths that we cannot find in ourselves at a bargaining
table. In this case, we risk far too much.

The technology will fail, we should expect that and have the courage
to take chances where there is something to learn. Only a fool or a
madman would risk an entire civilization's fate on a gadget.

Let's continue into space, with all due speed. But let's also stop thinking
that nations (people!) will settle their differences with gadgets.  The
philosopher's stone for human relations just doesn't exist.

Thursday night I was mistakenly arrested by a Pasadena police patrol due to
a computer error.  I spent two hours in a smelly holding cell while my
friends collected bail.  $130.50 Cash.  Exact change please.

When I appeared in court Friday morning with proof that the ticket had in
fact been paid in February of 1984, the case against me was dismissed.

In conversation with the court clerk and with the police officers who
processed me I learned that mistakes like this are not uncommon, and that
the safest thing for me to due is to keep the 1984 receipt on my person
at all times.  One friendly officer said "In processing these (warrant
dismissals), the paperwork goes through so many hands that if anyone
drops the ball there is no way to tell what happened."

It appears I have a good case against the City &amp; County of LA ("failure to
properly document computer system"), and the City of Pasadena ("improper
stop and use of excessive force by arresting officer").  The excessive force
claim arises because the officer physically prevented my departure after I
had identified myself and before the information about the bogus warrant
came over the radio.  He is not supposed to do this.  There may be an
additional case against Pasadena if in fact the statute on the original
offense (jay walking in 1981) had expired.

Do any of you high powered legal types have any insights on my case?  Do any
of you folks know good, reasonably priced lawyers in the LA area with whom
you have had personal experience?  Have their been any problems with Chas. &amp;
Angelique Johnson, attys?  I am also looking for a good patent lawyer, so if
you know/are one please write me.

My interest in this news group (until now) has been focused on copyright &amp;
software marketing issues.  I am a grad student in Computer Science at
Caltech.  Hobbies include science fiction, the tunes of Garcia/Hunter, and
long distance running.  I would like to do triathalons too but my swimming
is weak.  Pleased to meet you all.

              ANGRY CALLER TITHES UP FALWELL'S LINE

    A self-employed computer whiz in Atlanta is under orders from a
telephone company to stop making harassing computerized calls to the
Rev. Jerry Falwell's toll-free tithing line.
    Officials of Southern Bell said they would yank Edward Johnson's
service if he didn't unhook his phone from a computer that automatically
dials Falwell's "Old Time Gospel Hour" every 30 seconds, tying up the
line and annoying the operators.
    Falwell aides said they would take legal action against him.
    Johnson's computer has been making the calls to the Lynchburg, Va.,
line day and night since April.  Officials estimated that the computer
has made 500,000 calls to Falwell's line.
    Johnson, 46, a computer analyst who said he wants to bog down Falwell's
fund-raising operations and hurt the organization's morale, maintained that
he is not impressed by the threats.  He said he is considering moving his
computer to a friend's telephone to continue the campaign.
    Falwell aides said they would take legal action against Johnson, who
started his crusade against Falwell after his mother "almost gave the
family farm away" to the television evangelist.
    Mark DeMoss, a Falwell assistant, said Falwell has lost a dollar for
every call Johnson's computer has made.
    "We do plan legal action," DeMoss said.  "Naturally toll-free calls
in that quantity would constitute a pretty significant expense for us."
    Johnson's crusade stopped Friday at 11 a.m. when a Southern Bell
security agent, acting on a complaint from Falwell's organization, called
Johnson and ordered him to unhook his computer from his phone or lose
his telephone service.

	I recently read an article in CACM about two earthquake monitoring
networks in California.  Presumably they are designed to withstand a major
earthquake so they can perform their data collection functions, etc.  Does
anyone know if they really are designed to function during a major earthquake?
If so, what design considerations were used?

In RISKS-2.5, Sean Malloy writes:
 &gt;One of the points that was brought up during the broadcasts the day of the
 &gt;disaster was that the telemetry tapes were going to have to be analyzed to
 &gt;determine if there was any indication as to what happened.  The temperature
 &gt;data for the external tank was specifically mentioned as one of the
 &gt;telemetry streams that was NOT fed to a display in either the launch control
 &gt;area or Mission Control. The NASA spokesman explained that there was so much
 &gt;information coming in that a decision had to be made to limit what the
 &gt;launch control personnel had to pay attention to.

Has Expert System Technology been thought of as a fix for this
problem?  It would seem that a really fast computer (or several) could
monitor all those inputs which aren't under the direction of human
flight controllers and could be set to pop up warnings for any
conditions that are unacceptably peculiar.  The human flight controllers
would still have the final word on what to do, the computer would just
be there to watch those things that the staff normally can't.  Are
expert systems yet advanced enough to make this worthwhile?  If so,
are any being used?

In the Challenger case, there was a 4% loss of thrust in the SRB about
15 seconds before the explosion.  If this had been correlated with a
temperature rise in the ET or some other anomaly that indicated possible
SRB burnthru, there might possible have been warning of the problem.
An expert system might have been able to correlate several minor
readings that together formed a pattern of SRB failure.  A succinct
display of the information together with the machine's conclusion
could have been given to one of the controllers.

Of course, it is possible that the telemetry tapes contain no information
that would have helped - even if it were monitored.  Abort before the
SRBs stop firing is (I'm told) a risky thing anyway, so advance warning
may not have been of much value.

&gt;Subject: Redundancy in the Shuttle's Computers 
&gt;To: RISKS@SRI-CSL.ARPA

&gt;A submission in RISKS-2.2 was concerned about a Stratus-like comparator
&gt;mechanism being a single point of failure in the Space Shuttle's operations.
&gt;However, the space shuttle's redundant set doesn't use a comparator
&gt;mechanism.  Instead, the actuators are controlled by a hydraulic
&gt;"force-fight" mechanism, with each computer sending independent commands on
&gt;independent buses.  If one computer of four fails, the other three can exert
&gt;enough force to overpower its (presumably bad) commands.  If this pressure
&gt;differential persists for long enough, the overpowered one is hydraulically
&gt;bypassed.

How is a *single* hydraulic comparator any different than a digital
"force-fight" mechanism?

An article in the L.A. Times of Feb. 6, 1986 discusses the dangers of
carrying nuclear cargo in the shuttle. The article states:

The Energy Department contends that the protective shell around the
plutonium would withstand explosive pressures up to 2,200 psi, and that
the shuttle explosion appears to be less than 2,200 psi.  According to a
NASA-produced safety analysis report on the Galileo and Ulysses projects,
... a blast caused by activating the spacecraft's "command
destruct" mechanisms' explosive devices attached to the large external tank
and suspected of being detonated by Challenger's leaking solid rocket
booster would produce a burst of pressure ranging from 740 to 7,800 psi. If
a shuttle fails to get off the pad and topples over, even greater explosive
pressure could be generated...possibly as high as from 2,000 to 19,600 psi.

      [By the way, this morning's SF Chron indicates the destruct charges
       for the external tank were found intact.  PGN]

To Be Held in Pittsburgh 4-5 April 1986

PITTSBURGH -- "The Future of Software Protection", a two-day symposium
scheduled for 4-5 April 1986, will bring prominent legal scholars and others
together to discuss one of the most crucial and controversial legal issues
of the day.  The symposium is jointly sponsored by the Software Engineering
Institute and the University of Pittsburgh Law Review.  The program will
focus on intellectual property law and whether it can evolve to provide
adequate protection for software.

Topics to be discussed during the one and a half days include patent
protection for algorithms, simultaneous copyright/trade secret protection,
scope of fair use in copyright cases, ownership rights in computer generated
works, and sui generis protection for software without legislation.
Discussion on the second day will center on the Department of Defense's
software procurement policy.

The registration fee of $100 includes the University of Pittsburgh Law
Review issue in which articles by the major speakers will be published.

&gt;Has expert system technology been thought of as a fix for this problem?
&gt;...  a really fast computer ... could monitor all those inputs which aren't
&gt;under the direction of human flight controllers...
&gt;Are expert systems yet advanced enough to make this worthwhile?

Unfortunately, expert systems developed to handle such an occurrence would
have to be based on a foreknowledge of the relationship of the various 
anomalies that occurred in the shuttle disaster.  I seriously doubt that
most competent systems safety engineers could have predicted the occurrence
even with a full knowledge of the anomalies that occurred.  Development of
such an expert system would likely have to be based on that type of 
knowledge.  However, expert systems aside, I am amazed that the NASA systems
safety people would permit a multiple section rocket motor to be manufactured
at one location and assembled at another.  Misfortune has shown us in the past
that these composite structure solid rockets have some very unique and 
undesirable properties.  It will be interesting to see exactly where the 
failure occurred in the shuttle's SRB if in fact it did fail.  If the failure
occurred at some location other than the suspect joint, chalk another one
up to experience.

References: Jim Giles' comments in Risks 2.7

Well, it's certainly possible to set up some sort of expert system that
would monitor incoming telemetry and issue warnings in case of
possibly-dangerous combinations of unusual conditions.  However,
I can see a couple of difficulties involved here:

1- There are some conflicts re the amount of data that you want to
   feed into the expert-system tool.  Certainly, the more data that
   is available (from many different classes of sensors), the smaller
   the chance that the tool won't have the information needed to
   detect the problem.  [For example, Challenger was equipped with
   far fewer sensors on the SRB than was Columbia during its tryoug
   flights].

   But... as you increase the number of individual sensors, and the
   amount of data (# of different classes of data, especially), you
   necessarily increase the number of rules in the system, and the
   amount of crunchpower necessary to step through the rules and
   determine whether any conclusions need to be brought to the
   attention of the controllers.  It doesn't do you much good to
   receive a warning saying "Engine failure is probable, based on
   conditions xxx and yyy" if you don't get the warning in time to
   do anything about it.

   In my [very limited] experience, very few if any existing expert
   systems are capable of handling large amounts of real-time data;
   the ones that I've seen tend to be somewhat sluggish.  I don't
   doubt that it would be possible to build special-purpose hardware
   that would support such a system... but I don't believe it has been
   done yet.

2- As I understand them, expert systems are designed to reproduce (or
   mimic) the sort of what-if and maybe-then decision sequences that
   an expert would go through when analyzing a particular sort of
   problem.  They work by encoding (in explicit form) the steps and
   conclusion that an expert would use.  A large part of the work
   involved in developing an expert system is sitting down with the
   expert(s), and assisting them in encoding their (often implicit and
   unspoken) rules into rigorous form.

   All well and good... BUT... the expert system's "expertise" is
   entirely limited by the completeness of the rules that are used to
   construct it.  One cannot assume that an expert system will be able
   to detect or diagnose a situation that has never been encountered
   before... it may do so, if the rules were complete enough and if the
   situation is similar to one that has occurred before, but you don't
   want to bet your life on it!

   Only the simplest expert systems can ever be considered to be
   "complete".  When solving a complex, real-world problem (such as
   "Is the shuttle's current behavior normal?"), the best that you
   can expect is that some useful fraction of all possible situations
   will be analyzed in a meaningful fashion.  Expert systems tend to
   grow and evolve as they are used... just as a human expert's
   capabilities do... and both humans and expert systems will tend to
   misdiagnose situations that fall outside of their current knowledge
   base.

3- Even if an expert system reacts quickly and accurately enough to give
   a meaningful warning ("SRBs leaking, ET overheating, explosion
   imminent"), you're still faced with: [A] Human reaction time (controller
   and pilot);  [B] taking the necessary immediate action (split the
   SRBs from the ET and/or split the orbiter away from the ET);  and
   [C] surviving (getting far enough away from the ET before it goes
   *BLOOIE*, and then completing a very difficult dead-stick turnaround
   and landing, or a tough water ditching).  In the case of the Challenger
   explosion, it looks as if all three of these factors were dead-set
   against the crew... there was very little time to react, no way
   to get away, and a water ditching would probably have killed many
   of the crew.

I imagine that you could certainly build an expert system that would
be capable of reading the shuttle's telemetry, and warning of most
conditions THAT THE DESIGNERS OF THE SYSTEM HAD TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT!
The real problem lie, of course, in detecting conditions that no one
had expected would occur... if the system has no rules that would lead
to a conclusion such as "The SRB segment ring seals are leaking",
then the system will never report such a condition.  At best, some other
warning will be reported ("Asymmetric thrust from SRBs exceeding
2%");  at worst, no warning will be received, or the system will issue
warnings unnecessarily ("Heavy engine vibration").

I don't think the worries about plutonium should be dismissed out of hand.
It is my understanding that the lethality of plutonium is due to its extreme
toxicity, as opposed to its radioactivity.  Comments from a knowledgeable
chemist are eagerly solicited.

I took the liberty of forwarding Gary Leaven's question on earthquake
monitoring systems (ie, are they designed to function during a major
earthquake?) to Mike Raugh, the author of the CACM article which
prompted the question.  Here's his reply:

             ---------------------------------

Matt,
	The question you forwarded to me is a good one: Are the
seismic instruments used in Calnet and the Southern California Array
built to withstand the shaking of a major earthquake?  The answer is
Yes and No, but it doesn't matter!  Even if a local subset of
instruments (or the telemetry system serving that subset) is
knocked out by a major quake, more distant instruments will pick up
signals from the quake that will be adequate for locating, timing and
calculating the earthquake "mechanism", i.e. direction of first motion,
plane of rupture, magnitude.  The purpose of the two arrays is to 
monitor earthquake activity throughout California, so you can see that
the entire combined two arrays will almost certainly not be totally 
incapacited by a major quake, hence they will continue to monitor 
activity (even distant activity) successfully.
	That being said, it should also be mentioned that seismologists
are very interested in the fine-grained signals that are obtainable
only at close range to a major earthquake (seismic waves that have
traveled teleseismic distance through the earth lose much of the higher
frequency energy).  Such close-in data from large earthquakes can only
be obtained from special "strong motion" instruments: this type of
instrument furnished the data for Archuleta's study of the Imperial
Valley quake discussed in my paper.  Strong motion instruments are much
more difficult to make, for all the obvious reasons, and are
expensive compared to the ones that comprise the two arrays mentioned
above.
	The problem of designing sophisticated modern microcomputer
based instruments that have sufficient sensitivity and dynamic range
and are robust in the presence of violent shaking is a big one.
Especially when you consider that such instruments must have local
storage and power supplies to back up data collection in the event of 
telemetry break-downs.   I can think of two groups at the USGS in Menlo 
Park that are working on systems of this kind.  The first is lead by Roger
Borchardt (his GEOS project was mentioned in my article).  Another is
being conducted by Larry Baker, Joe Fletcher, and Paul Spudich, who are
developing a down-hole three-dimensional mesh of instruments for
observation of the detailed progression of faulting expected to occur
in the officially USGS-predicted earthquake at Parkfield.  In other
words, new designs for such instruments are on the frontier of research
and development at the USGS.  Very likely other work of similar import
is taking place elsewhere.
	I hope this answers your question.
		Mike

Neither of these stories involves mainline computer risks, but they might
contribute some insight. 

I got this story from a friend doing earthquake research for the USGS. I
think it was '71 when a bigish quake near LA collapsed a VA hospital and a
half constructed bridge. That generated a lot of interest in the way
buildings (and bridges) react to quakes. Nobody really knew how much stress
is present on various structural parts of a building. In response, many
strain recording gizmos were installed in many large buildings.

Time passed, and everybody went back to their normal work. After several
years, another bigish quake came along, and somebody remembered all
those installed instruments. So they went out to collected them. Most of
them had died. I don't remember any numbers, but I was left with the
feeling that everybody was discouraged that they didn't get much
interesting data.

Another friend worked on LASA (Large Area Seismic Array?). It was one of the
early seismic arrays with hundreds of sensors scattered over eastern
Montana. I think it was primarily part of the bomb test detection program.
With that many sensors and that much wire and electronics to collect all the
data, a few sensors were always off the air. They discovered that they got

... I can tell you that earthquake instrumentation really need not survive 
a local earthquake.  Local measurement is very unreliable because of
environmental factors: soil type, underlying geologic structures, and so
forth &lt;the force in Mexico City's earthquake is a good example because it's
so far away from epicenter&gt;.  Meters over such areas go off the scale as a
matter of practice.  It's the more distant meters which can separate the
different waves which are important for triangulating location, magnitude,
etc.

On the news recently, it was noted that the recent Canadian train wreck
[8 Feb 1986] "shouldn't have happened as the system was computer
controlled."

     [Bill Dewan, spokesman for the Canadian National Railroad, was 
      quoted in the SF Chron, 9 Feb 1986: "The [freight] train should not
      have left the double-track section, and whether its failure to stop
      was due to signal failure or human failure is what is under
      investigation."  Death toll initially estimated 30 to 50.  Eastbound
      transcontinental passenger train with up to 120 people aboard, 
      head-on with westbound freight on single-track section, 75 yards
      after freight left double-track section.  PGN]

                                ------

In today's Boston Globe (Sunday, Feb. 9, 1986), an article by Rick Gladstone, 
Associated Press discussed problems caused by "the growing effect of
computerized buying and selling programs that influence stock prices without
regard to economic fundamentals that historically have shaped the market."

These programs monitor stock prices and future prices for the same stock,
selling the stock and buying futures when the stock price exceeds the
futures price and buying stocks and selling futures when the stock price
falls below the futures price.  "The investors, therefore, profit no matter
what."  ... The recent big swings of the Dow Jones average "are partly
attributed by some Wall Street analysts" to these programs, "because they are 
activated at the same time and greatly increase the number of shares traded."

... Many analysts "agree that at least part of the Dow Jones industrial 
average's record 39.10-point plunge Jan. 8 was linked to a mass of
sell-program orders activated by the computers."

In Risks V2.7, Jim Giles raises a question regarding selective display of
telemetry, with a computer helping control what is displayed.  This is
currently being done in the "Electronic Flight Instrument System" (EFIS)
being used on, for example, the Boeing 767.  The EFIS can be configured to
display various data on command by the flight crew, and to display "flags"
if certain things go outside the normal range.  This is by no means using
what we might consider full-blown expert systems technology.

For those unfamiliar with the 767 cockpit, or an EFIS in general, there are
various CRTs under computer control.  Usually, the tubes immediately in
front of the pilot and the co-pilot display the flight attitude (an enhanced
"artificial horizon"), often with airspeed, altitude, heading, and trends.
Additional tubes display route and various engine parameters.  These
additional tubes are those used for displaying abnormal information.

A couple of EFIS configurations are available for some of the larger general
aviation aircraft (for example, Beech's new Starship turboprop will be
delivered with and EFIS).  It is interesting in light of this digest to note
that in all EFIS configurations I've seen, there are ALWAYS conventional
(i.e. mechanical) backups for the critical instruments portrayed by the EFIS.

Clive Dawson (in Risks 2.4) asked what kind of data display the Range Safety 
officer at Cape Canaveral uses to determine when to destroy missiles.

Data is collected from a wide variety of sources throughout the Eastern Test 
Range, including a number of radar and telemetry sites and optical trackers. 
The latter are especially important in the first few seconds of launch, when 
radars cannot be used due to multi-path problems associated with the large 
metal gantries. This data is collected by the Central real-time computers 
(redundant Cyber 740's), which determines the best and next-best estimates of 
present position and instantaneous impact point for the missile body. This is 
displayed by the Range Safety Display System (RSDS) computers along with plots 
of destruct lines, which indicate the limit of endangerment of a populated 
area if the missile's thrust were to terminate at that moment. These destruct 
limits are considerably broader on the Shuttle than they are for an unmanned 
missile. In addition, the RSO's maintain a voice link with the Shuttle Flight 
Dynamics Officer (in Houston), and they will not destroy the Shuttle as long 
as the crew is in control, even if the destruct line is violated.

The RSO's also have real-time telemetry displays and video plus a voice link 
to an observer as close to the launch pad as safety permits to assist at the 
initial moments of flight when the data is at its worst. 

This system provides the best chance for crew survival within the limits of 
range safety, assuming there is enough time in a danger situation for crew
response (which there wasn't in the Challenger explosion).

At the time that my husband, Martin Moore, was working on the destruct
software at the Cape, I was working on a radar data switching system which
is physically located in the same room as the RSDS system. I was also one of
the near-real-time analysts for the Central computer, involved in reducing
post-mission trajectory and orbital data. In the course of my duties, I
learned a lot about the RSDS system and the other data collection/display
systems at Cape Canaveral AFS (which is not quite the same thing as Kennedy
Space Center -- KSC is NASA, CCAFS is the Air Force).

The following passage from a 6-part "editorial" in the San Francisco
magazine "Processed World" argues that the Space Shuttle disaster will
not (as Proxmire claimed) shake people's faith in technology.  Instead,
it may strengthen their resolve to pursue technology regardless of risks.
(Fortunately, the same argument can not be applied to the Chernobyl accident;
people don't have the same love affair with Soviet nuclear power that they
had with the Shuttle.)

Send me mail if you want more info about the magazine; this is from the
recently published Number 16.


         "Braking Star Wars, or a New Standard of Patriotism"
                          by Marcy Darnovsky

  "If the fireball that consumed Space Shuttle Challenger slows down the
  development of Star Wars, the seven people that perished in it will
  not have died in vain.

  "To millions of space enthusiasts, the shuttle and the space program
  are tributes to curiosity, imagination, courage, and the quest for
  knowledge and adventure.  These are among the worthy impulses of the
  human spacies.  But what most space boosters don't see through the
  glitter of the stars (leaving aside the problem of how to divide the
  purse between cross-town buses and interplanetary travel) is how
  these impulses are being used and perverted.

  "Whatever its origins, there can be no doubt about what master the
  Shuttle now serves.  Starting in 1987, the Pentagon had planned to use
  half of the spacecraft's cargo bay at least twice a year for Star Wars
  experiments alone.  It had claimed a third of the available shuttle
  launches over the next ten years.  Under the National Space Policy
  adopted by Reagan, the Pentagon is not only NASA's largest customer,
  but also its preferred customer, and as such is entitled to bump
  civilian, commercial, and scientific payloads off Shuttle flights.

  "For a short time, the suspension of Shuttle missions and the loss of
  one of the four orbiters will slow the military's invasion of space.
  But before long, the space arms race will be back in harmony with the
  spheres.  The scientific and commercial aspects of the space program
  will probably come out the losers, with NASA dancing to the Pentagon's
  tune even more slavishly than before.

  "A month after the explosion, some of the astronauts voiced dissatisfactions
  with NASA safety procedures and secrecy.  It's too soon to tell whether
  their criticisms will crack the unnerving unaniminity of popular support for
  more space spectaculars.

  "Remarkably, instead of planting doubts about the reliability of complex
  technologies and the push into space, the destruction of the Challenger
  seems to have convinced most Americans that no sacrifice is too great for
  the technology that will conquer the stars.  NASA reports it received 90,000
  letters in the two weeks following the explosion, 99% of them supporting the
  space program.  "Something like this brings the nation together," said
  Daniel Boorstin in the New York Times.  "The space program in general has
  done that; people understand the grandeur even if not the technology, and to
  share that grandeur is what makes a great nation."  Boorstin is right: the
  majestic lift-off of a rocket with human beings perched atop it raises
  modern Americans out of their everyday lives into an epiphany of
  technological awe intertwined with chauvinistic pride.

  "The Shuttle catastrophe has constructed a new standard of patriotism:
  giving your life for your country's technology.  Instead of making it
  acceptable to question the military takeover of space, the Shuttle
  disaster may make the space program more sacred than ever.  If the
  explosion of the Challenger and the seven dead astronauts have
  transformed protest into heresy, it was more of a tragedy than we've
  yet realized."

  *** Shuttle ***

Today's SF Chron contains a Los Angeles Times story by Maura Dolan:

             Shuttle Program Was Doomed, Panelists Say

  The space shuttle prgram was so plagued by a lack of spare parts and
  mission softwre and inadequate crew training that flights would have been
  substantially slowed or halted by now even if the Challenger disaster had
  not occurred, members of the presidential commission that investigated the
  accident said yesterday.  ``There was no management of this program," a
  commissioner said.  ``Even without the accident, the program would have 
  ground to a halt by this point.'' 

The article goes on to quote other commissioners anonymously on inadequate
planning, having to steal spare parts from other shuttles, lack of training
time, one or two of the two simulators being down often, last-minute
reprograming without testing, and so on.  It also outlines some of the 
recommendations of the forthcoming report.

  There are about four or five other ... safety things that NASA has been
  playing the same game with as the O-rings -- the main engine, the brakes,
  the flapper valves (that control fuel flow), the automatic landing
  system," one panelist said.


  *** Nuclear Power ***

Jack Anderson's column in the same paper returned to Chernobyl and the
nuclear power situation in the United States:

  We have learned that, since the hideous accident in the Ukraine, the
  Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff called in the inspectors and informed
  them that new, more lenient interpretations of the fire-safety regulations
  had been approved by the commissioners over the inspectors' vehement
  protests...  Incredibly, the new guidelines let nuclear plant operators
  sidestep the protection of redundant control systems by planing fire
  safety for the first set of controls only.  The guidelines permit 
  partial fire barriers between the first control system and the backup
  system, which can be in the same room.  This means that a fire could
  short-circuit both systems.

ReSent-To: RISKS@SRI-CSL.ARPA

I have to question two statements that were made by Bob Estell in relation
to SDI software.  The first one, "A missile defense is worth having if it is
good enough to save only 5% of the USA population in an all-out nuclear
attack" is oft-heard.  The phrase "worth having" could be applied to a
number of things that aren't being had by many people (things like food,
shelter, medical care, or safer cars).  The question of whether something is
"worth having" irrespective of costs, as if one could snap his fingers and
have that thing is fine for idle conversation but of little use
realistically.  The question of what is worth pursuing and to what degree
must be taken up by society at large.  The magnitude of SDI costs as well as
admitted technical dubiousness must be compared with alternatives.  We can't
have everything that anybody says is "worth having."

The second quote, "That shield might save 75% of the population in a
terrorist attack, launched by an irresponsible source" deserves some
comment.  The "terrorist" argument is used fairly often also to garner
support for SDI, as terrorism is a popular topic on television, etc.  I am
prompted to ask from what quarter this terrorist attack would arise.
England? France?  Also, I would expect that SDI would fail miserably in the
event of anything less than the full-scale attack that it was billed as
deflecting.

How does this apply to Risks?  The rationale and the requirements are
the basis for a system.  If these are invalid, the system will probably
be invalid.  As Herb Lin said, "Politics are just requirements at the
top level."


POSTING NUMBER 2:

[Re Bob Estell's posting]  

I am not sure of the facts on this but I think it is pertinent to RISKS.
What is the story on the software for the Sargent York gun?  Was a "high
level" language used.  If so, and the complexity still defeated the project,
it bodes ill for SDI which consists of [the logical equivalent of?]
thousands (hundreds?) of Sargent York guns launched into space.  If a
high-level language was used, there is still life in the "historical"
argument described by Bob Estell.

   ** MY VIEWS MAY NOT BE IDENTICAL TO THOSE OF THE BOEING COMPANY **

	{allegra,ihnp4,decvax}uw-beaver!uw-june!bcsaic!douglas
	bcsaic!douglas@uw-june.arpa

     [The use of a high-level programming language is only part of the
      problem.  In many cases, deep flaws exist in the design, and
      the implementation makes things only a little bit worse.  In those
      rare cases where the design is actually sound, the programming 
      language -- whether high-level or low-level --  introduces the
      possibility of additional flaws, such as loss of encapsulation,
      lack of strong typing, lack of consistent exception handling,
      improper sequencing or atomic actions particularly in distributed
      systems, lack of adequate control transfers and domain changes, 
      and so on.  But such problems exist in ALL of the commonly used
      programming languages.  PGN]

From the SF Chron, 4 June 1986, Washington Report, p. 13:

  The house approved and sent to the Senate yesterday a bill that would
expand coverage of federal laws against computer crime.
  The legislation, passed by voice vote, would make it a felony knowingly to
trespass into a "federal interest" computer -- one operated by a federal
agency, a federally insured financial institution or by stockbrokers
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- to obtain anything
of value.
  It also would apply to entry into private computer systems located in more
than one state.  The top penalty would be five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
  The measure also would establish a new category of misdemeanor for
"hackers" who use computer bulletin boards to display passwords to computer
systems.  The top penalty would be a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.

   [I note that "to obtain anything of value" does not cover denials of 
    service, mass deletions of data, insertion of nonbenevolent Trojan
    horses, and so on.  The multistate basing clause may lead some 
    organizations into distributed system and network operations just for
    the legal coverage!  PGN]

    There probably isn't a lot more to be said about backing-up data that is
new.  Since someone else brought up the subject, I'll recount a very recent
case of incorrect back-up procedures from here in central PA, and then make
a suggestion or two.  [OK. I STILL ACCEPT A MESSAGE OR TWO ON THIS TOPIC. PGN]
    A small local firm was burglarized and their micro-computers stolen.
All their diskettes were also taken -- yes, including all those carefully
made back-ups.  I don't have exact values for the worth of the data but the
loss was enough to have significant impact on a small group.
    I guess this comes under the heading of improperly defining the risk.
Everyone knows that computers can "eat" data and that's why one makes
copies.  How many of your typical users think about flood or fire, which are
problems common to all data storage systems, much less theft which is a
threat peculiar to micro-computer use where the diskettes are worth
something -- even if they don't contain expensive programs.
    I could just say, "Boy, what a dumb mistake.  They should have had
hard-copy of as much stuff as practical, and protected those back-up
diskettes."  That's not very productive, though.  The answer lies in
education and perhaps in program developers meeting the real needs of the
users.  Computer users need to know how to protect their data and why.  A
couple of horror-stories go a long way.  Either practical back-up schemes
described step-by-step (such as how to copy only files created after a
certain date) or else menu type software should be generally available.
This information should be easily accessible to people who don't know a
whole lot about programming or even about their system. (If I were a
diskette manufacturer I'd give away back-up program-packages.)  And don't
forget the worst part of using your archive-copies -- figuring out which
version of what you are working with.

You are absolutely right .... However, I think the problem this time is
not with the algorithm to compute the most reasonable time but the fact that
the machine was unavailable (but not down!) for about half-hour this

5 Jun 1986 1910-PDT (Thursday)
</i><PRE>

The following is a personal observation and not an opinion of my employer.

Next week the President's Commission will be reporting its findings on the
Challenger incident.  Already leaks have occurred, and I find some of them
in Time magazine.  While I cannot completely comment on the bureaucracy
problems in NASA, it is interesting to note that part of the solution to the
launch decision problem is adding more members (contractors and astronauts)
to the final launch decision process.  There is an irony to that.  One on
hand we have been trying to reduce bureaucracy, to make committees smaller,
and so forth, and one would ideally have astronauts and contractors
"represented" by a "good" bureaucrat, and yet the solution is to increase
the size and complexity of some committees.  Yes, safety should be first,
but how do you achieve safety?  Or should I say achieve safety and balance
it with complexity?

This complexity actually has another system to compare it to: SDI.  I don't
want to completely open a can of worms, but we should keep our eyes open on
this other space program and see how it handles complexity in contrast the
to manned space program.  Several weeks ago, Danny Cohen at USC-ISI reported
somewhere (I thought it was Science, but I saw it in stronger language) that
SDI developers (i.e., the aerospace community) have been very conservative
about their use of computers and that SDI needs the state-of-the-computing-art.
Cohen said something to the effect that we have to push aerospace companies
to use the most advanced computing techniques available.  Space companies
have always tried to use tried-and-true technologies and have varied them
only one slow degree at a time.  I would like to point out to the
readerships of both the space and risks digests that these two different
forces are now acting upon companies like Lockheed, Rockwell, and so forth,
and it will be interesting to watch how they develop.

Both systems are quite complex, conservative to some degree, but supposedily
diverging forces are pushing for more conservativism and less conservatism.

	Offense is much easier than defense.  The mention of terrorists
brings to mind an obvious BIG hole in the whole SDI concept.  If I were a
terrorist (or even the USSR after some SDI was in place), I'd take a serious
look at the wide open U.S. society, the thousands of miles of shoreline and
the leaky borders with Mexico and Canada.  Why bother trying to get through
a massive defense system (as unreliable as it might be) when you can land a
boat or drive a pickup across the border with a nuclear device and plant it
under City Hall in Anytown, USA?  And if anyone has any doubts, just take a
look at the unstoppable influx of drugs and illegal aliens.

	Maybe what SDI should really be is a big perimeter around our
borders to stop such things.  Now if someone can just get the algorithm
to distinguish heroin, aliens, and plutonium...

At the risk of beating a dead horse, I would like to take issue with this
statement by Bob Estell:

&gt;That shield might save 75% of the population in a terrorist attack, launched
&gt;by an irresponsible source; this is far more likely than a saturation attack
&gt;by a well armed power like the USSR.  

The risk of such an attack (a terrorist attack with an ICBM) is nearly 
nonexistent.  In the first place, it is a lot easier and cheaper to perform
a terrorist attack, even a big one, with nothing more exotic than conventional
explosives; consider, e.g., the destruction of the two main water conduits 
serving New York City (I just read a mediocre novel with this as its premise.)

Secondly, even if the terrorists decide to go the exotic route, chemical or
biological weapons are much easier to produce (or otherwise obtain) and 
deliver.  Several years ago someone mailed packages of white powder to various
DoD sites.  The powder was the crystalline form of Lance, a nerve gas; tasting
the powder would cause instant death and smelling it would cause permanent
brain damage.

Thirdly, even if the terrorists decide they just *have* to use an atomic bomb,
it is much more practical to either build it in place (see "Build Your Own
A-Bomb and Wake Up the Neighborhood" by George W. Harper in the April 1979
issue of _Analog_) or to deliver it by more conventional methods (probably
ship, but possibly airplane.)  It is much harder to build an effective
ICBM than it is to build an effective A-bomb; a crude bomb will still do the
job, but a crude ICBM will most certainly miss your target, assuming that it
doesn't blow up in your face first. 

Finally, even if the terrorists somehow managed to obtain a few missiles
with H-bombs attached, nowhere near 25% of the US population would be 
endangered.  At a guess, the smallest area containing 25% of the population
would be the entire Boston-Washington strip, with Los Angeles, Chicago, and
Atlanta (I've never liked Atlanta) thrown in for good measure.  It would
take a *lot* of bombs accurately delivered to kill 25% of the population.
Furthermore, as Herb Lin pointed out, the technology is already there to
defend against limited attacks.

    From: bcsaic!douglas at uw-june &lt;Doug Schuler at uw-june&gt; [...]
    What is the story on the software for the Sargent York gun?  Was a "high
    level" language used? If so, and the complexity still defeated the project,
    it bodes ill for SDI which consists of [the logical equivalent of?]
    thousands (hundreds?) of Sargent York guns launched into space.  If a
    high-level language was used, there is still life in the "historical"
    argument described by Bob Estell.

I don't think the Divad failed because of software, if software is
construed in the narrow sense of improperly written lines of code.
However, the problem WAS a system integration problem, and thus does
have some relevance to software issues.  The stated reason for Divad's
failure was that it was unable to hit Soviet choppers at long enough
range.

Consider the time that Divad shot at a latrine fan during a test, looking
for the rotating blades of a helicopter.  The Divad radar looked for a
particular Doppler shift in the return signal, and you can imagine how the
fan could mimic a helicopter blade.  Is this a software problem?  It seems
to me that you could argue it both ways, but in either case, I don't think
the presence of a high-level programming language would have helped.

     [Flawed algorithms often appear as "undependable" software, although
      they can of course equally well be embedded in hardware.  We should 
      not try to make too much of the hardware-software distinction.  The
      "blame" usually rests on the shortcomings of the designers and 
      implementers...  PGN]

Your comments on the conflict between reducing bureaucracy and increasing
the number of persons in the loop take us rather far afield from the risks
of computer use...but they are similar to some concerns I've had for some
time, and the "complexity" issue has relevance to this list, so what the heck.

In my opinion one of the *major* challenges facing humans is the need to
find better ways of structuring organizations, and training individuals to
function within organizations.  Our present performance ranges from barely
adequate to abysmal; the current consequences of this performance level are
extremely serious, and the prospects are that these consequences will get
worse.  Blindly intoning "we need less bureaucracy" is no help.

Those are strong statements; let me explain.  When the number of persons
necessary to an enterprise rises much above that appropriate to a single
work-group some *organizational* as opposed to *individual* division of
responsibility becomes necessary.  (Xerox doesn't build copiers by getting
several thousand employees together, telling them all to "build copiers at a
profit," and leaving them to their own devices thereafter.)  As the
compartmentalization of the organization increases, the relationship between
the output of each unit and the goals of the organization becomes less
clear.  "Do your job right" becomes an unsatisfactory performance criterion;
specifications become of necessity more formal.  It becomes possible for
individuals or sub-organizations to prosper by appearing to meet proper
criteria, or by actually meeting improper criteria; such performance may
actually hinder the successful fulfillment of the intended organizational
goals.  Individual behavior tends toward that which is *actually* rewarded
by the organization, as opposed to that which is *stated* to be desired.
It's like entropy; all the forces are toward declining performance, and
because it's a coupled (people/structure) problem the trends are extremely
difficult to reverse.

It is presently fashionable to point to the government as a bad example of
rampant bureaucracy.  This is to an extent fair; I believe there are two
reasons that the problem is generally worse in government than in the
business sector:

  1) We desire of our government that it be one of "laws not of men"; this
  requires formal specification of acceptable performance (laws and
  regulations).  If OSHA published simple, common-sense guidelines ("don't
  unduly endanger your employees") they'd be thrown out by the courts on
  the perfectly sound grounds that the proscribed behavior was undefined;
  instead we get five-page definitions of an acceptable ladder and such.

  2) The constraint on organizational reasonableness which acts on
  business (don't be so unprofitable as to go bankrupt) is somewhat
  stronger than that on government (don't be so expensive and unresponsive
  as to cause the voters to rebel).

But the differences are those of degree, not of kind; I suspect that #1
above is the more important, and I am extremely skeptical of those who
contend that a good dose of free enterprise will serve to solve, by
Darwinian selection, the organizational problem.  And the problem applies to
not-for-profit, military, and all other "large" organizations as well.

Draw what parallels with large hardware/software systems you wish; AI buffs
may note the analogy with the notorious difficulty of programming "common
sense", for example.

I just came from a televising of Rogers and Fletcher (our own internal TV
feeds).  Permit me to clarify the forthcoming dilemma.  The matter is not
solely a problem of "bureaucracy."  "Bureaucracy" is an artifact, and the
word had a tainted denotation.  Another, perhaps clearer artifact would be
the trend in NASA from a centralized to a decentralized (NASA Centers really
became "Centers") and now back to a more centralized agency (command at NASA
HQ) versus the more decentralized approaches SDI (Cohen et al.) are proposing
(admitted automated).

  Aside:  Are automated bureaucracies any better than human bureaucracies?

The gist of what I hear Mr. Jackson saying is on the nature of organizing
complex systems (a la Simon's Sciences of the Artificial).  I would also
like to point out that Jacob Bronowski pointed out just before he died that
the great challenge facing humans was the balance of individuals (I
extrapolate to include centralized authority) to groups (decentralized).

The point of my posting was to note that we have an interesting juncture and
we should be prepared to note the different paths taken for future
comparisons (and future mis-intepresentations).  Another interesting
thought occurs to me about SDI, but that will be a separate note which I
will Cc: to Arms-d.

Again, the viewpoints expressed are personal and not views of the Agency.

These two items are from the June 3, 1986 issue of PC WEEK.

  IRS I: The Internal Revenue Service has thrown a chill over the PC software
  business. It recently ruled that creators of computer programs that help
  taxpayers prepare their tax returns may be subject to penalties if the
  program gives bad advice. The ruling will put the software developers on the
  same footing as flesh-and-blood tax advisors:  at risk.

  IRS II: TCS Software of Houston is already in trouble with the IRS. The
  company was contacted by the IRS because its tax-preparation software
  program, Client Tax Series-1040, was listed as the tax preparer on the 1985
  tax return of one Richard P. Jamerson.

The IRS was up in arms because Mr. Jamerson had used a fictitious Social
Security number, hadn't included a check with the tax return, hadn't signed
the return or included a W-2 form.  Fortunately for TCS, Mr. Jamerson owes
no taxes since he doesn't exist.  He is the totally fictitious example that
goes out with the TCS package to show users how the software package works.
Apparently, one of the sample returns was inadvertently mailed to the IRS.

The latrine fan story keeps going around and around.  The radar never saw a
latrine, much less one with a fan.  The Doppler return of a hypothetical fan
on a hypothetical latrine would differ significantly from the fans on a
helicopter.  The story is full of the same stuff as the latrine.  Let's not
fall into it again.

According to 60 Minutes (or was it 20/20?) the DIVAD did not shoot at a
latrine fan.  It was distracted by a small ventilation fan, but I'm not sure
that it even targeted on the thing.  The fan wasn't on a latrine; the
analogy to a bathroom fan was created by a PR man who was trying to explain
to reporters how small it was.  The "software problem" was much easier to
fix than the PR problem.

I'm an expert-systems enthusiast precisely because such bugs do crop up in
all real-world systems.  Expert systems "technology" is a form of
institutionalized hacking -- programming by successive approximation, or
debugging as part of the design effort rather than part of the maintenance
effort.  It's related to the pancake theory ("Plan to throw the first
version away.  You will anyway."), but goes deeper: plan to throw every
version away, but use the current one if you have to.

                  [Perhaps that is the radioactive pancake theory.
                  ("They're too hot to eat, but they're fun to make.
                  If you really get hungry there's always one ready,
                  and it's probably better than starving to death.")  PGN]

Effort continues on optimal algorithms and proofs of correctness, but too
often we optimize the wrong thing or omit real-life complexities from our
proofs.  (Computers are particularly vulnerable.  How do you prove that a
gamma-ray burst during a critical routine won't change a crucial bit?)
Those who build expert systems take the opposite tack: that systems will
always contain bugs, so each piece should be robust enough to function in
spite of numerous sources of uncertainty and error.  This is similar to the
renewed NASA policy that every critical shuttle system have a backup.  I
think it's a healthy viewpoint.

    [This item illustrates the need for awareness of the technology by people
     in the environment.  The interference problem is also relevant to RISKS.]

In the Thursday 5 June 1986 issue of The New York Times, there is an article
about an accident that occurred with a magnetic resonance imager--the first
serious accident of this type.

The device uses a huge magnet with a hollow cylinder for the patient to lie
inside.  The accident occurred in a converted semitrailer used for mobile
diagnosis.  A technician was in the hollow when two steel tines, weighing
more than 80 pounds each, were ripped off by the magnet from an
(intentionally) approaching forklift, and ended up knocking the man 15 feet
away, and breaking many bones.

The magnet complicated rescue work.  A doctor could not approach until he
removed his stethoscope.  A paramedic's scissors flew off when he tried to
cut the injured man's pants.  A policeman nearly had his gun pulled from his
holster.  Rescuers were slow to grasp just how strong the magnetic field
was, and to realize that all metal objects had to be removed in order to
approach the injured.  And finally--here's where the computer connection
comes in!--the magnetic bank cards of the rescuers were erased.

The magnet's emergency shutdown could not be used, as it hadn't been fully
installed yet.  So it took 20 minutes instead.

The article pointed out that in normal usage these difficulties are not
present, as normally special equipment is used and all nearby personnel are
familiar with its power.  But as revealed by the accident, emergency workers
do not have such training.  (They also do not have training for lots of
special and exotic situations.  There is a certain iatrogenic irony
in this situation -- which is not uncommon in medical practice.)

          ["Iatrogenic" implies that a problem is caused or made worse
            inadvertently by doctors and/or medicine in what might 
            otherwise be perceived as an attempted cure or improvement.
            [[As a result, one suffers from inadvertigo?]]  The use of
            "irony" seems like an attractive pun in this context.  
            Thanks.  PGN]

Note--some details are slightly unclear from the article I read.  If anyone
wants more details, you are referred to a recent letter in The New England
Journal of Medicine, by(?) Drs. Syverud and Fowler.   -Matthew

After watching the reports on TV giving the conclusions of the Rogers
Commission, a question occurred to me that may be relevant to Risks. A lot
of attention has been given to the fact that some of the rocket engineers
recommended against launching the Challenger. What I haven't heard anyone
talk about is whether such recommendations before a launch were common. The
media coverage has always implied that the engineer's protests were an
unusual event, but is this really the case? I can easily imagine a scenario
where before every launch a different engineer recommends against launching,
but management decides that their reasons are not adequate (after all, one
of management's jobs is to evaluate such recommendations) and goes ahead and
launches as scheduled. After awhile the situation might become similar to
the little boy who cried wolf.

I'm not trying to defend NASA, or implying that the above scenario
describes the situation. I'm just trying to understand the context of
their decision to launch Challenger. Can anyone shed any light on this?

       [I hope one of our readers can respond.  With regard to the software
        problems, there have been complaints that the new mission software
        was frequently delivered only at the very last minute, and that no
        extensive simulation testing could be done.  The impression is given
        that whatever the state of the software was at the final scheduled
        delivery date, that is what was delivered -- irrespective of how
        buggy it might be.  I think it would be very helpful to understand
        the circumstances better.  Tasteful reports on this subject -- as
        well as the more general question raised by Don -- would be welcome.

Estell makes the following comment:
	
  The "complexity" and "historical" arguments even interact.  
  Peter Denning observed years ago that the difficulty of understanding a 
  program is a function of size (among other things).  He speculated that 
  difficulty is proportional to the SQUARE of the number of "units of under-
  standing" (about 100 lines of code).  Old tactical software, in assembly 
  language, tends to run into the hundreds of thousands of lines of code; 
  e.g., a 500,000 line program has 5000 units of understanding, with a diffi-
  culty  index of 25 million.  That same program, written in FORTRAN, might 
  shrink to 100,000 lines thus only 1000 units of understanding, thence a 
  difficulty index of one million.  That's worth doing!

I believe that the same program written in a "high level" language,
like Fortran, would probably have about the same number "units of
understanding" ~ 5000, in this case.  Assuming that the "units of
understanding" are understood to be higher level concepts, Fortran
would enable one to write those units with fewer lines of code.  But I
wouldn't expect the number of those units to decline with nearly the
same scale factor.

Of course the likelihood of a typographical error would be reduced by
such a scale factor, but that's not the major concern here.

I believe there were several retractions - enough for me to believe, at any
rate.  If I hadn't been so tired when I sent that bit to Peter I would have
expounded further on the delightful topic of various matters hitting the
fan, etc.

I *hope* that whoever designed the helicopter-rotor-selection algorithm did
more than simply search for cyclic doppler.  There are too many things out
in the real world that rotate but aren't helicopters.  
	- Wind turbines on a barn
	- The rotating beacon at some airports
	- Windmills
	- Cooling fans on the roof of a large building
	- Cooling fans on top of a diesel/electric locomotive 

By the way, I have patronized a fair number of outhouses down in the Shenandoah
Valley - While almost all needed (desperately!) ventilating fans, only one or
two had them - and they sounded like squirrel cage blowers within a ventilating
pipe, not likely to be picked up by Sgt. York's radar.  Nose yes, radar no.

  One of the most important categories of long term risks to the public
from technology seems to have been overlooked in Risks so far.  The
assumption that more technology is automatically good is so ingrained
in our thinking that it is hardly questioned.  We measure our welfare
in terms of Gross National Product, not by how many people have enough
to eat, or by distribution of income.

  In particular a vast amount of our technical, capital and human
resources are expended developing monolithic energy technologies
without regard to end use needs. The public has long been duped into
the idea that centralized energy management has it's best interest in
mind as we develop ever increasing electrical capacity. But centralized
reactors and other "hard" technologies are extremely susceptible to
terrorist attack and other failures, as has been mentioned before.

  The public has been told that it doesn't have the expertise to make
decisions about such high risk high technologies as SDI and nuclear
power, and in some sense this is true. But the technocrats have
preempted the public's right to make the moral and political policy
which guides the choices.

  I think that we should be pursuing a policy course which develops
technology that can be put safely in the hands of non-technical people.
This might take the form of small burners which use the methanol from
organic wastes, windmills, or non-electrical solar collectors, to name a few
possibilities.  Localized, distributed technologies have many advantages,
including ease of repair, localization of risk from outage, and major
reductions in distribution losses and cost of distribution equipment and
labor. I strongly recommend Amory Lovins' "Soft-Energy Paths" to others
interested in issues of appropriate scale in technology.

The cover story of the September, 1984, CACM is "A Case Study: The Space
Shuttle Software System".  As with other CACM case studies, this one is
a discussion, or interview, with several people involved with the subject
matter, in this case 6 individuals from the IBM Federal Systems Division.
An Outline of the Interview included in the article contains:

  Project Overview
  The Shuttle Computers
  Project Organization
  Testing Facilities
  Detailed System Operation--No Redundancy
  Redundant Set Operation
  System Problems
  The Interprocess Variable Problem
  Concluding Remarks

The issue also contains several other articles in a Special Section on
Computing in Space, including "Design, Development, Integration: Space
Shuttle Primary Flight Software System", written by 2 senior technicians
from the IBM FSD.

It seems like a good place for a novice to the shuttle and its systems
(like myself) to get some basic information about the shuttle computers
and the complexity of the systems.

The view expressed within are the view of the author and not of my agency
nor of the Federal government.  ------------------------------ A lot of
interest has been expressed regarding the focus of the problems of SDI: the
software, in particular battle management.  Note the Science article of May
9 1986.  However, I wonder about the other components of the system.  Where
there are various groups watchdogging computing, but the more hardware
oriented, EE areas such as radar have fewer opposition elements. Recent
postings on cruise missiles and the integration of DIVAD move me to post this.

Sensor technology is one area which worries me.  SDI battle management
makes certain assumptions about the ability to detect and identify targets.
I think that most computer people don't understand the nature of radar
to worry about the problems of `target' detection and ranging.  That is
all that radar is: detection (boolean) and ranging (distance=rate times
time). A first starting references is Skolnick's text on Radar. (Dated)

Inherent problems with a ranging system include: Range and azimuth
ambiguities, difficulties with empirically determined signatures.  Most
people don't seem to understand that knowing the geometry of systems are
important.  Satellite images [some radar maps to be used in offensive
missiles] are not photographs (you must call them images) because their
geometry is from a linear and not a point perspective, so distance
determination for things like cruise missiles cannot be done using a
straight edge.  Radar (simple) is like looking at the world using a
monochromatic spot light from the point where you are looking: you don't get
shadows (an important distance cue).  Note: I have not talked about clutter,
or noise (ever wonder how high speed jets detect jets from ground objects,
or how AWACS which points down get insignificant ground objects cleared?).

While there exist solutions, all of them involve tradeoffs in complexity,
cost, and new emergent problems.  Solutions in Doppler systems,
phased arrays, stereo transmit/receive systems, but just the inherent
simplicity of the concept and the over-generalization of use worries me.
This is a case where "high-level language" solutions may not be
high-enough.

A news clipping from this morning's "Los Angeles Times" (page 2, The News
in Brief):

   The House Judiciary Committee voted 34 to 0 for a bill seeking to
   bring constitutional guarantees of the right to privacy into the
   electronic age.  The legislation would extend laws that now protect
   the privacy of the mails and land-line telephone conversations to also
   cover electronic mail and some telephones that use radio waves.
   The bill was cleared at the request of Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier
   (D-Wis.), chairman of Judiciary's subcommittee on courts, civil
   liberties and administration of justice.

Anyone know the details?  Just what privacy coverage would be afforded
by this bill in its present form?  How would the bill's provisions
affect the sysops of private electronic bulletin-board systems, for
example?  Would this bill clarify the legal standing of electronic
transactions and messages re their use as evidence in court?

     [Very strange.  RISKS-3.1 noted that the House sent a bill to the 
      Senate on 3 June that covered "federal interest" computers.  Is this
      an additional bill, or a modification of one already sent over?  
      Maybe someone in the House is reading RISKS and noted the apparent
      flaws in the bill that I mentioned in RISKS-3.1?  PGN]

In RISKS 3.4, Mike McLaughlin (mikemcl@nrl-csr) and Ken Laws (laws@sri-ai)
dispute the Sargent York latrine fan story. [...]

I quote from a story by Gregg Easterbrook in the November 1984 issue of
_The Washington Monthly_:

    During a test one DIVAD locked on to a latrine fan.  Michael Duffy,
    a report for the industry publication _Defense Week_, who broke this
    aspect of the story, received a conference call in which Ford officials
    asked him to describe the target as a "building fan" or "exhaust fan"
    instead.

_The Washington Monthly_ and _Defense Week_ are both reputable publications.
Does anyone have a citation for a retraction in _Defense Week_, or should we
assume that the TV networks swallowed Ford's story whole?

Here is some information on the DIVAD software that hasn't appeared yet in
this forum.  [It] is abstracted from a longer note compiled by Reid
Simmons from material he received from Gregg Easterbrook (both his article
in the Atlantic, and personal communications).

According to Easterbrook, the DIVAD did target a latrine exhaust fan in
one series of tests.  The target was displayed to the gunners that man
the DIVAD.  But the Sgt. York did not shoot at the latrine, or even
swivel its turret in the latrine's direction, having prioritized the
target as less important than other targets in its range.

In another series of tests (Feb. 4 1984), U.S. and British officials
were to review the DIVAD as it took upon a rather cooperative target: a
stationary drone helicopter.  On the first test run, the DIVAD swiveled
its turret towards the reviewing stand as "brass flashed" and the
officials ducked for cover.  It was stopped only because an interlock
was put in place the night before to prevent the turret from being able
to point at the reviewing grandstand.  Afterwards, the DIVAD shot in the
general direction of the helicopter but the shells traveled only 300
yards.  The official explanation is that the DIVAD had been washed the
night before, screwing up its electronics.  Easterbrook wonders what
would happen if it rained in Europe when the DIVAD was being used.

Easterbrook goes on to claim that the snafus the DIVAD experienced were
very much due to software.  The main problem was that the pulse-Doppler
tracking radar and target acquisition computer were a very poor match.
Easterbrook claims that the hard problem for the software (tracking
fast, maneuvering planes) was easiest for the pulse-Doppler radar which
needs a moving target.  On the other hand, the hard part for the radar
(detecting stationary helicopters) was the easiest to aim at.  The DIVAD
mixed two opposing missions.

Easterbrook goes on to say that human gunners are often more successful
than their automated counterparts.  They can pick up on visual cues, such
as flap position on approaching aircraft, to determine what evasive
maneuvers the enemy might make.  These kinds of cues are not visible to
things like pulse-Doppler radars.  Further, evasive courses of action
are hard for human gunners to counter, but even harder for target
tracking algorithms (again the lack of visual cues comes as a
disadvantage).  For example, the DIVAD expected its targets to fly in a
straight line (which my military friends tell me is not too likely in a
real combat).

There is lots more to the Sgt. York story, not all of which is relevant
here.  If there is a moral to be drawn specifically for RISKS, it's
that as advanced as our technology may be, it may not always be the
match of the problems to which it is applied.  This was certainly the
case with the unfortunate DIVAD.

"Science", in the issue of 9 May 1986, contains an article on "Resolving the
Star Wars Software Dilemma".  The subhead reads:

  A panel of computer scientists has concluded that computers will be able
  to manage a strategic defense system -- but only if battle management is
  designed in from the beginning.

More, from within the article:

  ...The report is in fact a scathing critique of the way the Pentagon
  handles high-technology weapons design in general and software
  development in particular.  It deals with important questions about the
  limits of computing, the nature of reliability, the organization of
  large, complex systems, and the nature of strategic defense itself.

  And in a striking paradox, it validates what the program's many critics
  have been saying about the infeasibility of Star Wars software.  ...

  First, they say, battle management is tractable only if SDIO and its
  defense-industry contractors give up their tacit assumption that
  software is an "applique," something that can be sprinkled on
  preexisting weapons and sensors like pixie dust to turn them into a
  working defense system.  This assumption was quite evident in SDIO's
  so-called "Phase I" architecture studies, which were completed in 1985
  and which seemed to concentrate almost exclusively on hardware.

The "paradox", as I read the Study Group's findings in the article, is that
although it might be possible to design systems that did effective battle
management (in some interpretation of "effective") by integrating software
and hardware from the earliest stages of design, there is no sign whatever
that this could happen in the real world of military contractors and
politics.  Thus, in the report's view, it is effectively impossible to build
workable Star Wars systems.

Recommended, but not comforting, reading.  (The name of the full report from
the Eastport Study Group is "Summer Study 1985: A Report to the Director of
the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization", December 1985.)

&gt; (Eugene Miya writes:) ... Where there are various groups watchdogging
&gt; computing, but the more hardware oriented, EE areas such as radar have
&gt; fewer opposition elements.

Sensors and signal processing comprise a larger portion of 
the SDI effort than anything else, according to many reports.

The most informative comments I have heard were by Michael Gamble, a 
vice president (I think) at Boeing, and head of that company's 'Star Wars'
research programs. He administers about half a billion dollars worth of
contracts.  In a talk to the Seattle chapter of the IEEE on Nov. 14, 1985,
he noted that the total SDI budget requests for fiscal years 1985 through 
1990 would total about $30 billion, broken down as follows:  Sensors $13B,
directed energy weapons $7B, kinetic energy weapons $7B, Battle Management
$1B, Survivability $2B.  Sensors comprise almost half the total. (I do not
know whether these proportions are maintained in the somewhat reduced 
budgets that get approved.)

Gamble also explained why he thought missile defense was once again 
plausible, after being debunked in the early 70's.  "What has changed 
since then?" he asked rhetorically, and gave five answers, three of which 
involved sensors: first, long wave infrared detectors and associated cooling
systems, which permit small warheads to be seen agains the cold of space;
second, "fly's eye" mosaic sensor techniques (like the ones used on the 
F-15 launched ASATS and in the 1984 "homing overlay experiment") -- these
are said to "permit smaller apertures" (I didn't catch the significance of
that);  and third, low-medium power lasers for tracking, designation, and
homing.  The other two factors were long-life space systems and powerful
onboard computing capabilities.

There is a large computing component in the sensor field: digital signal
processing.  However, this area is not so well known to computer science
types.  Boeings largest SDI contract - over $300M - is for the "Airborne
Optical Adjunct," an infrared telescope and a lot of computers mounted 
in a 767 airliner, apparently for experiments in sensing and battle
management for midcourse and terminal phase.  Two of the systems people
involved in this project gave a seminar at the UW computer science department
last January.  They mentioned that the signal processing was being handled
by the sensor people and they just regarded it as a black box.

I can think of two reasons why this area has received relatively little 
attention.  First, there were no galvanizingly absurd statements about sensors 
from relatively prominent SDI proponents - nothing like James Fletcher 
calling for "ten million lines of error-free code," or all that bizarre stuff
in the Fletcher report and elsewhere about launching pop-up X-ray lasers 
under computer control.  Second, there is a lot secrecy in the sensor area--
unlike battle management, where the important issues do not turn on classified
material.  Gamble noted that "there is not that much that is classified about
SDI, except things like, 'How far can you see?  How far do you have to see?'"
Needless to say, talking in detail about sensors would reveal how much we know
about Soviet warhead characteristics, how good our early warning systems 
really are, and so forth.

As referenced in the recent RISKS, the CACM case study is a somewhat decent
introduction to the Shuttle onboard software. However, I would like to warn
readers that the case study editors interviewed IBM FSD personnel *only*,
with no attempt to talk to the customer, NASA, or the users, the astronauts.

I was under contract with NASA for three years to do a study of its use of
computers in space flight, and my interviews with crews and trainers
provided a somewhat more critical view of the software. Also, it is useful
to remember that the primary avionics software system documented in the CACM
study runs on four computers. Last count was that there are something over
200 processors on the orbiter (Source: Jack Garman, Johnson Space Center).

So, please take the CACM articles with a grain of salt.

P.S. To forestall some mail: The earliest NASA will release my Technical
Report is late 1987. 

  [In addition, Herb Lin responded to David Smith, included here for emphasis:
   "This issue of CACM *is* a pretty good review of shuttle software.  On
    the other hand, you must remember that the interview was with the
    people who were in primary charge of the project.  Thus, you would be
    rather unlikely to hear about problems and so on that remained
    unresolved.  That claim doesn't diminish the value of the article,
    but it should prompt caution in accepting the general impression it
    gives that all was (or is) just fine...  Herb"  ]

In response to the House law about computer communications privacy, I
believe that the following is correct.  Right now, communications are
protected if they are telephone, mail, and other "traditional"
technologies.  One can not "wiretap" you without a warrant.  The current
laws don't cover computer communications or car phones or other "new"
communications technology.  According to what I read in Wash. Post
this bill would consider car phone communications, computer communications,
and others the same as the mail and land based phone calls.

Life is usually a delicate balance among many tradeoffs.  Running
RISKS is no different:

  The subject of Risks to the Public in Computer Systems involves
  tradeoffs among technical, social, economic, and political factors.
  These are very hard to assess, because each person's basis for
  judgment is likely to be different.  (All of these factors are
  relevant in the broad sense, although we generally try to focus on
  the technical issues.)  Some risks are intrinsic in technology; the
  question is under what circumstances are they worthwhile -- and that
  involves all of the factors (and more).

  If messages were too superficial or issues too infrequent, most of
  you would lose interest.  If issues and/or messages were very long or
  too frequent, you would most likely be overwhelmed.  (But I occasionally
  get requests for single-message mailings from BITNET subscribers [who
  have not yet discovered undigestifiers?], although that presents many
  difficulties.)

  If I put too much of my time into RISKS, my other responsibilities may 
  suffer.  If I put too little time in, you may suffer.   

  If I turn down the threshold and accept contributions that violate
  the masthead requirements (relevancy, soundness, objectivity,
  coherence, etc.), we all suffer.  If you contribute junk and I don't
  reject it, you and I suffer.  If I turn up the threshold and reject
  many contributions, I defeat one of the main purposes of RISKS,
  which is to be an open forum.  

  If RISKS were to take itself too seriously, or alternatively to become 
  too frivolous, that would be bad.  [I try to keep my pun level down,
  but occasionally I may slip a little.])

So, thanks for sticking with us in this experiment in communication on a
vital topic.  Please complain to RISKS-Request or to me when you are
really unhappy.  It can only help.  Peter

The Challenger failure has an implication for SDI that I've not seen
discussed much.  I regard the solid-rocket failure as primarily a management
failure and only secondarily an engineering failure.  Why?  Because
according to the Rogers group reports, there had been serious concern with
the possibility of failure of the O-ring seals, but it got lost or
suppressed along the way.  Challenger's ill-fated launch was apparently made
in spite of best engineering advice to the contrary.

How does this apply to SDI?  I'll give a sketch; I hope that other people
will add more.  SDI is under fire from several places (substantial part of
Congress, various public-interest groups, many influential technical
people).  It is therefore important for the supporters (willing and/or
appointed) of SDI to present a convincing case that SDI can "do the job."
There is tremendous pressure to justify SDI.  Translate this into "there is
tremendous pressure to argue the case that SDI can be built and can work--
whether or not it really can."  To be blunt, there is a tremendous incentive
to cover up any potential inability to build an SDI system or any inadequacy
once it is built.  Of course, if the SDI system is built, and is used, and
fails, there will be much more lost than seven lives and some megabucks of
hardware.  (I have a hard time typing the word "terabucks":-) There probably
Wouldn't even be a presidentially-appointed blue-ribbon investigative
committee...

The hard questions:  Do we have a way to manage a project of the magnitude
of SDI that will give us any halfway-reasonable assurance that the project
will work?  Is there any technique that can be applied to reward those who
discover problems and punish those who cover them up, instead of the other
way around?

(My own experience, unfortunately, tells me that these aren't really hard
questions.  Rather, they are questions which are easily answered "no!"  The
difficulty in managing any large project, particularly one which involves a
lot of software, is legendary.)

In summary, I'm saying that Challenger failed not for technical reasons--
I believe that the technical problems are real but surmountable--but for
managerial reasons.  Further, I think that we need to talk about SDI
feasibility in more than technical terms; we need to address whether we
could manage the project even if all of the technical problems were
surmountable.  The answer is anything but a clear "yes".

Dick Dunn

     [From The New York Times, Sunday, 15 June 1986:

     New York - The ''Star Wars'' anti-missile plan has been seriously and
     extensively damaged by the Challenger disaster and other setbacks in
     the American space program, aerospace analysts say.  Officials of the
     anti-missile defense program, formally called the Strategic Defense
     Initiative, deny any serious damage to the program, but aerospace
     experts say the problems within the space program have sent shock waves
     through research programs. ...  ]

In RISKS-3.6, Michael Natkin states:

  The public has long been duped into the idea that centralized energy
  management has its best interest in mind as we develop ever increasing
  electrical capacity.  But centralized reactors and other "hard" technologies
  are extremely susceptible to terrorist attack and other failures, as has
  been mentioned before.

Centralized power supplies may be "extremely susceptible" to terrorists but
their susceptibility to failure is not as high as being claimed.  It is true
that the consequences of a failure might be great; however, for a large
centralized power plant it is economical to expend greater resources to
prevent their failure (e.g., redundancy) than for the components of a
distributed system.  Furthermore, I submit that all current power systems
have some degree of distributed or redundant functionality to allow periodic
maintenance shutdowns if for no other reason.

I further submit that there is a significant risk associated with
distributed systems which is being ignored.  Many such systems are
themselves dangerous when poorly maintained or operated improperly.  There
are also hazards associated with storing combustible fuels near a dwelling
or other populated area.  Witness the following:

  o  How many chimney fires have you heard about since the "energy
     crisis" began?  A fireplace is a relatively low-tech device yet
     some people manage to make them dangerous.
     
  o  Why is it that several houses burn down at the start of every
     cold season?  An oil-fired furnace is a relatively low-tech
     item also, yet every year someone's gets choked with soot and
     catches fire.
     
  o  Ever heard of a methane gas explosion in a sewer system?  I
     recently heard an amusing story about a manure fire at a horse
     ranch - ten years worth of horse manure had been piled in one
     place until one day it spontaneously caught fire.

One would be surprised how much damage some people can do with low-tech
alternative energy.  To paraphrase one of the better known 'computer
security experts' [emphasis added], "Terrorists can never compete with
incompetents".  I wonder whether more people lose their lives each year in
the commercial production of power or in incidents similar to the above.

With respect to the public "being duped" - sounds like another
conspiracy theory to me (yawn).

Although Chuck's note does not seem as closely related to RISKS as some of
his past contributions, it suggests various additional comments.  A myth of
distributed computing systems is that distribution avoids centralized
vulnerabilities.  WRONG! The 1980 ARPANET collapse gave us an example of an
accidentally propagated virus that contaminated the entire network.  The
first shuttle synchronization problem is a further example.

By distributing what has to be trusted, there may be more vulnerabilities --
unless the distributed components are TOTALLY autonomous -- in which case we
are not really talking about DISTRIBUTED systems, but rather SEPARATE
systems.  Security flaws in the systems and networks can result in
transitive vulnerabilities, or permit global compromises by iteration.

Further, the point raised by Chuck regarding maintenance is an important one
in distributed computer systems, especially if some of the distributed sites
are remote.  Well, then, you say, let the field engineers dial up the remote
site.  But then that path provides a monstrous new vulnerability.  Then we
get solutions like the remote backup scheme proposed a while back that gets
special privileges...  Also, remember the fundamental flaws in the standard
two-phase commit protocols, three-clock algorithms, and so on.  Once again
it might be useful to consider truly robust algorithms such as interactive
consistency and Byzantine agreement.  However, for every more complex
would-be technical solution there are often further technical problems
introduced.  For every assumption that things have gotten better there seem
to be even grosser counterexamples and further vulnerabilities outside of
the computer systems.  Thus,

  It is folly to trust software and hardware if an end-run can bypass or
  compromise the trusted components.  But it is also folly to assume that
  sabotage is significantly less dangerous just because a system is
  distributed.  That may be true in certain cases, but not generally.

Peter                 [Please excuse me if I have repeated some things that
                       I said in earlier RISKS in a different context.]

  &gt;A news clipping from this morning's "Los Angeles Times" (page 2, The News
  &gt;in Brief):
  &gt;
  &gt;   The House Judiciary Committee voted 34 to 0 for a bill seeking to
  &gt;   bring constitutional guarantees of the right to privacy into the
  &gt;   electronic age.  The legislation would extend laws that now protect
  &gt;   the privacy of the mails and land-line telephone conversations to also
  &gt;   cover electronic mail and some telephones that use radio waves.

Does anyone have any idea how the last part (radio telephones) could be
legally supported in view of other legal freedoms?  I thought that one
was free to listen to any frequency one wished in the US (Canada too).
You don't have to trespass to receive radio signals.

Contrast this with the mails. The privacy of the mails is supported by
property laws.  That is, you put your mail into a box which belongs to
the post office.  If anyone breaks into that box (or the van which
picks up the mail, etc) they are breaking property laws.  Similarly for
land lines.  One has to 'trespass' to tap a land line.

It seems to me that the legislators have 'extended' the laws over an
abyss.  Or have I missed something?

The relevancy to RISKS, of course, is that most people don't think about
the technology that radio-telephones use.  I'm sure most people assume
"it's a phone - it's (relatively) safe".  Not true, of course.  In fact,
some people have used their own handsets to make phone calls on other
peoples phones!

Michael Wagner

  [I do not recall having pointed out in this forum the ease with which
   the cellular phone schemes can be spoofed, e.g., getting someone else
   to pay for your calls.  There is another security/integrity problem
   waiting to be exploited.  PGN]

The information in this message is political, not technical. However,
it concerns the process of supplying technical information to those who
must make political judgements, so I believe that it is germane to Risks.

Recent news accounts have indicated that the outcome in the Senate of
requests for increased SDI funding is very unclear. Senators are having
to take positions on a matter they don't fully understand, and many of
them would like to be better informed.

I was contacted by an aide to Senator Proxmire for information about how
David Parnas's criticisms of SDI software are viewed in the professional
community. General Abramson and the SDIO have had some success in
spreading the message that David Parnas is an isolated crank who is not
taken seriously by those who actually build software.

I was able to express my own opinion and concerns, but cannot speak
credibly for the entire professional community. Pound-for-pound, Risks
probably contains more people qualified to make an informed judgement on
this issue than any other group I know how to reach. Whatever your views,
I would urge you to take the time to write a letter expressing them to

	Mr. Douglas Waller
	Office of Senator William Proxmire
	United States Senate
	Washington, DC 20510
	
Based on my experience, you can expect your letter to receive personal
attention, and to carry weight according to your credentials and the
cogency of your arguments. (This is in sharp contrast to my experience
writing to my own senators and congressman.)

In addition to stating your own views clearly, it would probably help to
indicate how they relate to Parnas's criticisms and (if you have read it)
to the Eastport Report. In my own letter, I also devoted a paragraph to
sketching my credentials; I don't much care for such self-advertisement,
but thought I should give a starting point for any checking they cared to
do, and the reasons why I felt qualified to comment on reliability and on
aerospace software.

My particular concern in the story that follows is that the designers and
programmers probably can't know ALL the conditions for which to check.  We
all know that complete testing of complex systems is impossible.  All too
often we are put into a position of trading risks and benefits, and at least
the risks (as in this case) are not and cannot be known completely.

Of course, another difficult question here is who is responsible for what
happened and what should be done about it.  Clearly for those three
patients involved and their families and friends no amount of placing
responsibility, punishment, or compensation can make up for what was done
to them.

_______________
MAN KILLED BY ACCIDENT WITH MEDICAL RADIATION
(excerpted from The Boston Globe, June 20, 1986, p. 1)
by Richard Saltos, Globe Staff

A series of accidental radiation overdoses from identical cancer therapy
machines in Texas and Georgia has left one person dead and two others with
deep burns and partial paralysis, according to federal investigators.

Evidently caused by a flaw in the computer program controlling the highly
automated devices, the overdoses - unreported until now - are believed to
be the worst medical radiation accidents to date.

The malfunctions occurred once last year and twice in March and April of
this year in two of the Canadian-built linear accelerators, sold under the
name Therac 25.

Two patients were injured, one who died three weeks later, at the East
Texas Cancer Center in Tyler, Texas, and another at the Kennestone Regional
Oncology Center in Marietta, Ga.

The defect in the machines was a "bug" so subtle, say those familiar with
the cases, that although the accident occurred in June 1985, the problem
remained a mystery until the third, most serious accident occurred on April
11 of this year.

Late that night, technicians at the Tyler facility discovered the cause of
that accident and notified users of the device in other cities.

The US Food and Drug Administration, which regulates medical devices, has
not yet completed its investigation.  However, sources say that discipline
or penalty for the manufacturer is unlikely.

Modern cancer radiation treatment is extremely safe, say cancer
specialists.  "This is the first time I've ever heard of a death" from a
therapeutic rediation accident, said FDA official Edwin Miller.  "There
have been overtreatments to various degrees, but nothing quite as serious
as this that I'm aware of."

Physicians did not at first suspect a rediation overdose because the
injuries appeared so soon after treatment and were far more serious than an
overexposure would ordinarily have produced.

"It was certainly not like anything any of us have ever seen," said Dr.
Kenneth Haile, director of radiation oncology of the Kennestone radiation
facility.  "We had never seen an overtreatment of that magnitude."

Estimates are that the patients received 17,000 to 25,000 rads to very
small body areas.  Doses of 1,000 rads can be fatal if delivered to the
whole body.

The software fault has since been corrected by the manufacturer, according
to FDA and Texas officials, and some of the machines have been retured to
service.

... (description of the accidents)

The Therac 25 is designed so that the operator selects either X-ray or
electron-beam treatment, as well as a series of other items, by typing on a
keyboard and watching a video display screen for verification of the
orders.

It was revealed that if an extremely fast-typing operater inadvertently
selected the X-ray mode, then used an editing key to correct the command
and select the electron mode instead, it was possible for the computer to
lag behind the orders.  The result was that the device appeared to have
made the correct adjustment but in fact had an improper setting so it
focussed electrons at full power to a tiny spot on the body.

David Parnas, a programming specialist at Queens University in Kingston,
Ontario, said that from a description of the problem, it appeared there
were two types of programming errors.

First, he said, the machine should have been programmed to discard
"unreasonable" readings - as the injurious setting presumably would have
been.  Second, said Parnas, there should have been no way for the
computer's verifications on the video screen to become unsynchronized from
the keyboard commands.

        [This story was also reported by Jim Kirby.  It is very rare that I
         get MULTIPLE copies of such a report.  Statistically, that suggests
         that there must be many things that never get reported...  PGN]

Excerpted from an article by Loren Stein of the Center for Investigative
Reporting in San Francisco, published in the July 1986 issue of the
Progressive:

"[...]Effictive with the 1986 budget, the Reagan administration has cut off
$1.5 million in funds for the non-ionizing radiation [the kind emitted by
VDTs] research program in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park, a
program in operation since [...] 1971.  `For several years,' says Jerold
Mande, an assistant to Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, `the administration
has tried to eliminate the program and each year the House defended it.
But the last time around, they gave up.'

"[...]Until recently, many scientists believed that non-ionizing radiation
could not affect the body unless its electric field produced heat or an
electric shock.  But in 1984, _Spectrum_, a leading engineering journal
declared that `a growing mass of evidence has virtually ended that debate.'

"`Evidence of the effects [of non-ionizing radiation] on the nervous system
and the immune system of animals was already well-established by the end of
the '70s,' wrote Eric Lerner, a former contributing editor of _Spectrum_
`while evidence of effects on the genetic material has accumulated most
rapidly over the past few years.'  These discoveries may mean that our
bodies are far more sensitive to non-ionizing radiation than previously
thought [...].

"Two of the EPA's most important experiments in non-ionizing radiation -
now shelved - underwent years of detailed preparation and were on the verge
of actual testing.  One involved the lifelong exposure of rats to low-level
radio-frequency radiation.  `I really looked forward to this experiment,'
says Tell.  `We had finally, after five years, gotten all the facilities
set up to support the experiment.  It took so much time, manpower, and
money.  Now it's through.'

"Another key project tried to replicate some dramatic findings for Jose
Delgado's research laboratory in Madrid, Spain.  In 1982, associates at
this labe discovered that extremely weak-pulsed magnetic fields - only one
five-hundredth the strength of the Earth's natural magnetic field - caused
chick embryos to develop malformed hearts and central nervous systems.

"[...]The EPA [...] will not participate in an international effort to
verify Delgado's findings - an effort made possible by the EPA's
development of equipment that is being shipped to Canada, Sweden, and three
other places to create identical test environments. [...]

"Funding for non-ionizing radiation research has been slashed in other
Government programs as well.  An eagerly anticipated reproductive study
involving 4000 VDT operators of child-bearing age by the National Institute
of Occupational Safety and Health was among the casualties.

"The EPA research branch is no longer necessary, claim some officials,
because the agency will soon publish voluntary guidelines for exposure to
RF radiation; overexposure can raise body temperature, which animal
research indicates may be harmful to pregnant women and their unborn
children. [EPA claims there's no conclusive evidence of harm.]

"Other experts [say] the EPA guidelines will suffer from the dismantling of
the agency's non-ionizing radiation research team. [...]Tell's office is
issuing the soon-to-be-published RF radiation guidelines; he says
`Obviously, we need biological experiments.  They've helped us tremendously.'

[Senator Gore has an interest in this and fought to keep the research.
Technical comments will be given to the EPA on the guidelines and the EPA
will not have the expertise to evaluate them.]

Two observations to add to Chuck Ferguson's comment on distributed
energy.  In the debate over the safety of nuclear energy it has been
proposed that a further alternative to the ones mentioned in Risks is
solar energy.  Those so doing ignore the fact that (whether the weather
cooperates or not in terms of percentage of sun) in the part of the
country he and I come from it would be necessary to clear the snow off
some types of solar energy devices in the winter.  The number of likely
deaths from people climbing on their roofs to shovel off their solar
cells is guaranteed to exceed the probable number of deaths from a
nuclear power plant accident.
</P><P>
The point here is not the specific technologies involved, but the two
recent messages on the topic just prompted to think of this one more
example (its going to be hot and humid here today, and somehow snow came
to mind) of how in comparing risks of various potential solutions one
must take everything into consideration.  (Isn't it also true that
coal-fired plants actually release a fair amount of low-level radiation
that somehow gets ignored?  and how many more deaths and injuries are
there amongst coal-miners than uranium miners ...  oops, got carried
away.  Note of course that any of these conjectures may be wrong and one
would have to insist on credible statistics before making any
conclusions.)

Headlines in `The Independent' (new British `serious' newspaper) on Tuesday
28 October 1986:

        Stock Exchange computers fail under strain
        Shambles as the Big Bang hits the floor

THE CITY'S "Big Bang" exploded after just 29 minutes' trading yesterday
morning when the computers buckled under the strain.  The Stock Exchange
system which speads information to dealers and investors went off the air at
8.29 am, to be followed 18 minutes later by the central dealing computer,
the Stock Exchange Automated Quotations system known as SEAQ.  By that time,
market makers were already experiencing problems in putting their prices
into the system, and some of them had ceased to trade at all. The failures
were blamed by the Stock Exchange on brokers overloading the system, both to
look at their competitors prices and out of pure curiosity.

There was an item in today's Independent (a new UK paper) about the results
of a security audit of 50 UK companies. Sadly, the results will be all too
familiar to RISKS readers. When will practice catch up with theory?

  "How Fred lets the fraudsters in" (c) Newspaper Publishing PLC
  by Michael Cross
  
  Frauds involving computers will cost British companies 40m pounds next year,
  the insurance broker Hogg Robinson said yesterday. The culprits are not
  usually teenage computer wizards but disgruntled employees and previous
  employees.
  
  Hogg Robinson's report, an audit of 50 firms, suggests that British
  companies are extraordinarily careless about looking after their computers.
  Apart from fraud, the dangers are sabotage, damage caused by carelessness,
  and run of the mill disasters such as fire or flood.

  The chink in most computers' armour is the password. All but three sites the
  auditors examined used passwords to control access to computers. Most were
  useless. When people choose their passwords, they often pick names of
  spouses or pets. These are easy for colleagues to guess. America's favourite
  password is "love", closely followed by "sex". Top of the list in Britain is
  "Fred".
  
  Other favourites, said David Davis, director of research at Hogg Robinson,
  are "pass", "God", "genius" and "hacker". "If a hacker tries these he will
  get through 20 per cent of the time", Mr Davis said.
  
  Passwords are particularly vulnerable when they remain unchanged for a long
  time.  The chairman of one major company the auditors investigated had kept
  the same password for five years. It was "chairman".
  
  Another danger point is in computers that allow unlimited guesses at
  passwords.  One in 10 of the sites surveyed allowed any number of attempts
  to "log in". The really secure passwords are the dual-key encrypted type.
  These are codes distributed in two parts, which link up inside a computer.
  But only two or three computers, all government installations, carry such
  protection in Britain.
  
  Despite the vulnerability of passwords, the report suggests that few
  computers fall victim to outside "hackers". Three of the sites inspected
  showed signs that hackers had gained access to the computers through
  external telephone lines.  Dr Frank Taylor, chairman of the British Computer
  Society's security committee, said there is no real evidence that hackers
  are causing large financial losses.
  
  Dr Taylor's horror stories have a more humdrum flavour. One concerns a
  building supplies company which had no security on its counter terminals.
  Crooked employees were able to give huge discounts to friends, and the
  company went broke. Another company lost its data - and nearly everything
  else - when lightning struck a power cable.
  
  Computers face a host of dangers from everyday activities, the report says.
  Mr Davis said that computers are designed to be operated by, "a race of
  supermen who do not eat, drink or smoke". He has a useful tip for computer
  people who cannot give up human habits; drink black coffee rather than
  white. It causes less damage if spilt.

A while back I reported that a lighning strike had taken out the computer
that controlled the synchronization of Austin's downtown traffic lights.
(Local control units took over - only two lights went "on the blink".)

I recently learned that there was more to the story.  It seems that Austin
has a "traffic flow program" embedded in that system that changes the
durations of red/yellow/green lights for given intersections based on the
time of day.  The goal is to give more time for people to get intown in the
mornings and out of town in the evening.  The local control units fall back
to an "equal time for all" scheme, regardless of time of day.

Since the power loss occurred late in the afternoon, evening rush hour
traffic was snarled more than usual.  In addition, there were several near-
accidents caused by people who "knew" that the yellow light would be long
enough (based on months of commuting experience).

Delphi Mac Digest          Thursday, 30 October 1986      Volume 2 : Issue 55

The most amazing thing happened at the hospital yesterday. I was accused of
unethical behavior because I used my computer to prepare a conference for the
Department of Surgery!

Let me explain.... I am the Clinical Coordinator of the Department of
Surgery at a rural community hospital. This is a voluntary job, in addition
to my regular practice of surgery. My responsibilities include the preparing
of the mortality and morbidity conferences each month, as well as trying to
put together educational topics of interest for the other surgeons. Having
trained at a University Hospital in Philadelphia, I enjoy doing this teaching.

In order to prepare for one of these conferences, I took my Tandy 100 to the
record room, and took my notes on it. When I got to the office, I plugged
the Imagewriter cable into the RS-232 connector on the back of the Tandy,
and using Smartcom II, loaded the information into the Mac for work
processing, spread sheeting, and graph creation.

Now, I am being accused of taking confidential information out of the
hospital in the form of patient records and doctors names! All I had on the
computer were my notes. The paranoid medical staff is afraid that having
this information in my "COMPUTER" is dangerous, in some way. Since I
consider my two computers just extensions of other work tools that I use, I
can't understand this. Would they be just as paranoid if I used a legal pad
to make notes instead of the computer?

By the way, the bylaws of the hospital allow for the use of records for
research, and I had permission from the President of the Medical Staff to do
the study in question.
 
Pretty amazing paranoia, huh? Do people really still fear computers this way?
Any physicians out there have similar experiences? Any legal advice?

It might have something to do with Legislators, who tend to know even less
about computers than hospital staff.  I've read some stories about how some
corporations are getting concerned about what J. Q.  Middlemanager is taking
home to work on using his own computer after downloading from the company
mainframe.

Yes, it's paranoid behavior, but no, it's not amazing, I'm afraid.  In my
institution (UCLA Dept. of Radiological Sciences) most of the data used for
teaching and research is in "machine readable" form at one time or another.
Clearly there is a valid issue related to the removal of confidential patient
records from the hospital (I don't know what the regulations are there) but
these would apply equally to data whether in handwritten, printed or machine
readable form.
 
You didn't say exactly who is objecting to your work and on what
grounds, but it sounds like they don't have a very good idea of what
you're using the computers for.  I can't give you legal advice though.

Santa Ana (UPI, 4 Nov 86; from the San Francisco Chronicle of that date, p. 40)

Malfunctions in key radar systems that track airliners in Southern California 
reached a hazardous level in recent years, but officials said yesterday that
the most serious problems have been found and fixed.  According to Federal
Aviation Administration reports obtained by the Orange County Register,
there were frequent breakdowns in the past four years in the Laguna Radar,
which monitors the area in a 200-mile radius around its perch east of San
Diego, and the San Pedro Radar, which scans a 200-mile circle around the
Palos Verdes Peninsula.  The systems monitor air traffic for Los Angeles
International Airport, John Wayne Airport and Lindbergh Field in San Diego.

The radar malfunctions grew critical enough that the FAA sent tecnicians
from Washington, D.C., to the Air Route Traffic Control Center in Palmdale
two weeks ago to monitor both systems and make adjustments.  Among the 
malfunctions were frequent disappearances of airplanes from radar screens
for 15 to 30 minutes and radar displays that show planes in a turn pattern
when they are actually on a straight course.

In some instances, the Register reported, air controllers saw aircraft
"jump" on their radar scopes, which made planes appear to have changed
direction when they had not.  In others, radars tracking plane descents in
an especially busy corridor showed jets traveling faster than they actually
were.  In addition, important altitude data that helps controllers avoid
midair collisions frequently disappeared from radar screens.  

FAA official Russell Park confirmed the problem and acknowledged that the
situtation could have been hazardous.  He said the malfunctions played no
part in any collisions, including that of an Aeromexico DC-9 and a small
plane over Cerritos on August 31.  He said the troubleshooting team from
Washington was able to fix the most serious malfunctions quickly.

                         [Quickly?  But this went on for FOUR YEARS?  PGN]

   [By the way, the November 1986 issue of the IEEE SPECTRUM is devoted to
    "Our Burdened Skies", and is a goldmine for those of you interested in
    our air transportation system.]

THE FUTURE OF LANGUAGE

[By Anthony Burgess.  From "2020: A Vision of the Future," in the 17 June 1986
"London Telegraph Sunday Magazine," a special issue devoted to the future.
Burgess is the author of "A Clockwork Orange," "Earthly Powers," "Napoleon
Symphony," "Nineteen Eighty-Five," "Re Joyce," and many other books.]

  Prime ministers speaking to the nation still attempt, like Mrs. Thatcher, to
  use "Standard English" and a supraregional or classless accent.  By 2020
  they will not have to do that.  What they will have to do is speak a kind of
  English that denies the fact of education, avoids allusion to Shakespeare or
  the Bible, and, where it rises above the level of conversational usage,
  gains a pose of learning and authority from the use of technological terms.
  At the same time, with a kind of ultimate authority seeming to be vested in
  the hard but high-flown language of science, there will be more mendacity
  and evasion dressed up as technology.  The Pentagon has already shown the
  way with such expressions as "anticipatory retaliation," which does not
  sound like striking the enemy without due declaration of war.
  
  America's language is already far advanced in the direction of combining the
  loose colloquial with the cant terms of the technical specialists -- who
  include sociologists and psychologists, as well as cybernetics experts and
  aerospace men.  When not being expertly evasive ("at this time the nuclear
  capability of this nation is not anticipated to assume a role of preemptive
  preparatory action"), it is slangy, unlearned, unwitty, inelegant.  At its
  most disconcerting it combines two modes of discourse: "Now we zero in on
  the nitty-gritty of the suprasegmental prosodic feature and find that we're
  into a different ball game."  It is already, perhaps, the matrix of British
  English of 2020.
  
  As for the sound of the English of 2020, some of its characteristics are in
  active preparation.  Assimilation -- a natural enough process, which,
  however, must never be allowed to go too far -- is drawing a lot of vowels
  to the middle of the mouth, where the phoneme called schwa (the second
  syllable of "butter," "father;" the first a in "apart") waits like a spider
  for flies.  The "a" of "man" is already a muzzy, neuter sound with the
  young.  Assimilation of consonants is giving us "corm beef: and "tim
  peaches" and "vogka" (Kingsly Amis spotted these in the early seventies).
  Grammar has been simplified, so that most sentences are constructed to the
  "and...and...and..." Biblical formula (hypotactic, to be technical).  Losing
  Latin in our schools, we are finding it hard to understand Milton and to
  appreciate the beauties of the periodic sentence.
  
  This will get worse.  The English of 2020 will combine structural
  infantilism with hard-nosed technology.  It will be harsh, and it will lack
  both modesty and humor.
  
  The written word is only a ghost without the solidity of the spoken word to
  give it substance, but to many it seems to be the primary reality.  After
  all, the voices of dead poets and novelists survive only as black marks on
  white paper.  Still, writers write well only when they listen to what they
  are writing -- either on magnetic tape or in the auditorium set silently in
  their skulls.  But more and more writers -- not only of pseudoliterature but
  of political speeches -- ignore the claims of the voice and ear.
  
  I think that, with the increasing use of the word processor, the separation
  of the word as sound from the word as visual symbol is likely to grow.  The
  magical reality has become the set of signs glowing on a screen: this takes
  precedence over any possible auditory significance.  The speed with which
  words can be set down with such an apparatus (as also with the electric
  typewriter), the total lack of muscular effort involved -- these turn
  writing into a curiously nonphysical activity, in which there is no manual
  analogue to the process of breathing out, using the tongue, lips, and teeth,
  and accepting language as a bodily exercise that expends energy.
  
  What is wrong with most writing today is its flaccidity, its lack of
  pleasure in the manipulation of sounds and pauses.  The written word is
  becoming inert.  One dreads to think what is will be like in 2020.
  
  I have never yet ventured a prophecy that came true.  In my little novel
  "Nineteen Eighty-Five" I get nothing except the name of the son of the Prince
  of Wales.  It is altogether possible that, rejecting the easy way of pop
  music, drugs, and television, the youthy of the near future will stage a
  reactionary revolution and go back to Latin, Shakespeare, and the Bible and
  insist on school courses in rhetoric.  But I do not think it likely.
  
[It should be noted, perhaps, that the Boston Globe recently published an
article that stated the offering of Latin in public high schools has increased
markedly in the last five years.  MM]

Burgess notes that word processors make writing too easy.  You can see the
result in the bloated junk novels, all over 300 pages long, that seem to be
designed only to fill waiting time at airports.

One of my colleagues once edited a computer textbook written by one of the
more important educators in the field (and he is a well-known writer
himself).  He said that "he nearly wore out the delete-paragraph key on the
word-processor."  The bad news is that there seems to be no real interest in
good editing in the commercial marketplace.  I would claim that this is a
direct result of the ease of writing with word processors.
                                                                 Martin

  [In a recent memo, EWD976-0, 10 Sep 86, Edsger W. Dijkstra makes a plea
   against bad writing.  One of his suggestions for making it easier on your 
   readers was this: ``Avoid if possible using one-letter identifiers that are 
   all by themselves words in the language of the surrounding prose, such as 
   "U" in Dutch and "a" and "I" in English, as they may confront you with
   unpleasant surprises.  (There is a page by David Gries, in which "I"
   occurs in three different roles: as a personal pronoun, as identifier for
   an invariant and as a Roman numeral! Of course, the reader can sort this
   confusion out, but it is better avoided.)''  EWD via PGN]

  From Daily Telegraph, Monday November 3rd:

  ``Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians may not be able to vote in the
  forthcoming general election because of bureacratic bungles. ... only
  70% of the electorate have been issued with the essential voting card.
  .... queues and frayed tempers are a result of a 30 million pound [c $42
  million] computerisation programme which was designed to streamline
  voting and eliminate fraud. ... Flaws in the system only became evident
  when distribution started three weeks ago. ...  [the computer] has been
  programmed to cancel all duplicate applications in order to weed out
  fraudulent "phantom" voters. ... while it showed that 1,400 dead people
  had voted for the mayor in the north-eastern town of Teresinha last
  year, and 100,000 falsified cards were in circulation in the southern
  state of Santa Catarina, it also cancelled legitimate names.
  Programmers overlooked that twins are born on the same day to the same
  parents. Consequently, the voting rights of an estimated 70,000 twins
  were cancelled. The Federal Electoral Tribunal in Brasilia is currently
  wading through 140,000 appeals, including the case of a certain Jose
  Francisco, who says all his 14 brothers were baptised with identical
  names. ... It is hoped that all those eligible will have their cards by
  the 15th. Those that do not will have to pay a 4 pound [c $5.50] fine
  or brave more queues and bureacracy to prove that they both exist and
  have the right to vote.''
   
Surely these sorts of problems have occurred before in other
countries.  What methods are available, if any, the avoid such risks
using computers without human intervention? Are such problems a
result of there not being *enough* computerised information on
the population to start with?

The recent entries in the  Risks  Journal  about  collision  avoidance  systems
reminds me of a comment a professor once made to me about the philosophy of the
FAA. For many years this professor in  the  Engineering  Design  Department  at
Tufts  University  worked  on  a  better  engineered cockpit layout and display
system. This included improvements in human factoring,  multi-function  graphic
displays  to  eliminate the number of indicators needed, and more functionality
in the cockpit to allow the pilot to detect and avoid other aircraft. 

After several years of work, where along the way  many  graduate  students  had
also  contributed, the system was presented to the FAA and turned down for what
the inventors could not fathom as valid  technical  reasons.   The  system  was
better,  easier  to  use,  and  provided  the pilot with more functionality and
autonomy over his aircraft and flight path.

The professor noted that the catch was the  FAA's  "apparent"  philosophy  that
they  don't  want  the pilots to have more autonomy in determining their flight
path and collision avoidance, as this task  is  considered  the  realm  of  the
ground (air traffic) controllers. His opinion was that any system that included
decentralization from ground control would be rejected because the FAA does not
want to threaten the job security of air traffic controllers.

This  political  "unspoken"  philosophy  of  the  FAA would still seem to be in
effect, providing you are willing to believe that technical  reasons  (good  or
bad)  will be used to defend such political objective(s). Perhaps the Honeywell
System is just another casualty.

This of course leads to the question of policy making. Does anyone know if  the
FAA  charter  contains  any  such  implicit  endorsement pro or con relative to
evaluating technology ? Does the FAA even have an  agreed  upon  philosophy  in
this regard that is published and accessible to the public ?  Or does some high
ranking, politically inclined, individual have the absolute veto  power  within
the government (FAA or otherwise) ?

This  seems  like  one  of those issues that will be difficult to substantiate,
most suitable to think about while flying in planes.  Note  that  the  November
1986 issue of the IEEE Spectrum is devoted to "Our Burdened Skies".  Although I
haven't read it yet, I will be interested to see if  there  is  any  reflection
(real or ghost) of such an FAA philosophy.

I talked to an R.R.A. today to get an opinion on PIZZAMAN's story
about taking the medical records information home on his computer.

The hospital sets up regulations to control access to the medical records,
which are carefully guarded as sensitive confidential information. The
physical record is considered to be owned by the hospital, and the
information is considered to be owned by the patient.  Typically, physicians
are allowed to take copies of medical records to their offices or home in
order to perform work directly related to patient care.  Preparing research
reports is generally considered to be within that scope.

People are generally not allowed to remove the original physical record from
the hospital, but copies may be OK.  The administrator I talked to didn't
think that it was significant that the information was copied using a
computer.  Of course, the physician has a serious responsibility to protect
the information from perusal by random persons, including his family,
visitors to his office, people logging in to his computer over the phone, etc.

So, the opinion of one medical records administrator seems to concur with
that of Dr. Tessler; the people at that hospital probably were over-reacting
inappropriately.

I don't know how well most medical personnel understand what computers
are; the person I talked to currently works for a company that writes
software for hospital administration.

So, this situation presents the familiar risk of paranoid confusion.
However, I would identify the major risk here as related to computer and
telecommunications security.  This is the same concern as for the hospital
which keeps their actual medical records online.  The two risks can be
related, of course.

If people have other questions or thoughts about this, I would be glad
to forward them along to my friend; she was interested that people
were discussing this sort of thing.

Ross's story reminds me of a similar incident which took place at Purdue
about five years ago; a misplaced rodent [in a power transformer] caused
most of the campus to lose power for about half a day.  The university
physical plant crews actually aggravated the situation while trying to fix
it by mis-diagnosing the trouble, in ways that have never been clear.  One
of the physical plant officials was quoted on the front page of the Exponent
(Purdue's daily) as saying "You've got to understand, with electricity you
never quite know what's going on".  I'm sure he was thrilled when a group of
EE students reprinted that quote on T-shirts and proceeded to sell them at a
brisk pace for the rest of the semester.  [I still wear mine!]

My 1986 Ford Mustang has (according to the literature) a micro-processor
controlled engine.  When driving it, you can tell that the engine RPM's
are contolled by something "intelligent" :

 - the high idle when cold to normal idle when warm transition has a
   distinctive change sequence as the engine warms up and this response
   is IDENTICAL every morning as I drive to work.  

 - If you hit the accelerator pedal and let go quickly, the engine
   speed returns to normal in about 3 distinctive steps: 
     1: a sharp drop of several hundred RPM's, 
     2: a smoother drop to very near the idle speed, and finally, 
     3: a small adjustment to the true idle speed.

 - If you disengage the clutch while the car is moving (first step 
   in gearing down), the engine speed drops quickly to a low of 
   200 RPM's (I can sometimes feel it shudder) and then the processor 
   corrects this with a "shot of gas".  If you leave your foot on the 
   clutch and just coast, you can observe the tachometer settle on the 
   idle speed after a small amount of overshoot and undershoot.

 - and finally, if you try to stall the car (starting off in first 
   gear without pushing the gas for example), the processor responds by
   trying to keep the engine speed at idle speed.

My Question... What are the risks in buying and driving an automobile with
               a computer controlled engine?

       Safety:  What are the odds of a malfunction causing acceleration?
  Performance:  Is this a feature?  Will the benefits of the microprocessor
                control continue to serve as the engine grows old and changes?
      Service:  Can a "Saturday Morning Mechanic" still tune his/her car or 
                is specialized equipment now a pre-requisite for the job?
       Safety:  Can the control over the engine be affected by an external 
                source (e.g. radio transmitter)?  I have noticed erratic 
                engine idle while in an automatic car wash....

[Wed 5 Nov 86 15:38]

In the San Diego Union was an article from the AP newswire.  A tape
recording of President Reagan urging voters to go out and vote
Republican went haywire and continuously called phone lines at a
hospital in Texas.  Over a six hour period several of the hospital
phone lines received a phone call every three minutes.

Today (November 6th) is the first day that there has NOT been an item in my
paper about some computer failure or other problem resulting from the Big
Bang!  Accordingly, it seems like a good time to take stock, and report what
has been going on. But first I would like to deal with a comment Jerry
Saltzer made about my original posting.

I quoted a newspaper article which referred to the TOPIC terminal network
used by the Stock Exchange as being
 
  &gt; . . . six years old and considered fairly antiquated by today's standards.

and Jerry Saltzer replied

  &gt; I wonder who it is that considers that system as antiquated?  Another
  &gt; perspective says that a complex system that has been running for six
  &gt; years is just beginning to be seasoned enough that its users can have
  &gt; some confidence in it...

Well, it was Sir Nicholas Goodison, the chairman of the Stock Exchange who
said that TOPIC was antiquated rather than a computer scientist, although
perhaps he was influenced in this view by his technical staff. He was also
quoted as "having breathed a sigh of relief" when he heard that the problems
were only with TOPIC and not the brand new and expensive (18 million pounds?)
SEAQ system. To its credit, as far as I know, SEAQ has not failed yet, although
it has been taken out of service on several occasions when TOPIC has broken
in the interests of fairness - some people can access SEAQ directly and this
would give them an unfair advantage.

Anyway, TOPIC probably was very stable ("tried and trusted" was another phrase
in the article I quoted) until the Stock Exchange started tinkering with it
just before the Big Bang. Indeed, according to an article in Computing 
(Oct 30th), the Stock Exchange "opened an electronic gateway" allowing
access to detailed SEAQ price information by an additional 7,500 screens
at the last minute, effectively quadrupling the load. The rest is history.

As far as the technology being antiquated goes, I believe that TOPIC provides
a video feed (Teletext) whereas SEAQ provides a digital feed, and perhaps
it is significant that it was the TOPIC/SEAQ link that failed. Apparently,
video is much less convenient for wiring up a dealing room so that you can
switch information between desks flexibly.

So perhaps, in that limited sense TOPIC is indeed antiquated, but the real
problem was caused by the tinkerers as Jerry said. However, I think that to
some extent, the issue here is akin to the recent discussions about whether
software rots. What changes are the assumptions a system makes about its
environment, and the Big Bang certainly produced a radically new environment.

Anyway, back to what's been happening since last Monday (Big Bang day).
TOPIC went down again on Tuesday at lunchtime, but since then has been
reasonably well behaved thanks to various emergency measures designed to
minimise the load.  In particular, there are restrictions on the time of day
that you can enter new pricing information, and the page refresh rate has
been decreased. The Stock Exchange anticipated a 50% increase in demand, but
the load actually doubled. The Sunday Times quoted the figure of 2.2 million
page requests/day (as opposed to 500,000 on NASDAQ, a comparable system on
Wall Street). Two new computers have been ordered to add to the eight which
already support the network, and should increase the capacity by 50%. On
Monday, a malfunction replaced the British Aerospace share prices with those
for Bass (a brewery).

But perhaps the most serious problem is the backlog of unmatched trade reports
which will have to be sorted out before accounts can be settled. At the
weekend, after one weeks trading, there were 55,000 such unmatched records,
and even worse, despite working at it all weekend, only 2,000 were resolved.
By Tuesday, there were at least another 4,000 bringing the total to 59,000
and 15 security firms are reported to be having difficulties with the new 
settlement system.

It is difficult to put these figures into perspective without knowing the total
number of trades in a week. 55,000 seems pretty big to me, and is apparently
five times the average, but then 11,000 also seems pretty big! A semi-informed
guess would be that 55,000 represents about 30% of the weeks trading.

The main reason for the backlog is a power failure at a computer bureau last
week, but human error caused by lack of familiarity with the new systems,
and "insufficient decimal precision" have also been blamed.

So with nothing in the paper today, everything appears calm, but as the
Independent put it yesterday, "behind the scenes, officials are faced with 
nightmarish problems". The next big test of the system will be in December
when trading starts in 6 billion pounds worth of British Gas shares, the
biggest share issue ever, aimed at getting as many share holders as possible,
(7 million people have expressed an interest!). I think the dealers might
just be going back to the deserted trading floor of the Stock Exchange...

  "Dog days for dire Stratus" (c) Computing
  
  As the blue touch paper for the Big Bang was finally lit this week,
  one company that must have allowed itself a sigh of relief is 
  fault-tolerant computer manufacturer Stratus.
  
  The trouble is that, while stockbroker companies are usually delighted
  with their Stratus machines, they [the companies] have an unfortunate
  habit of demonstrating the non-stop capabilities to clients by wrenching
  out a circuit board while the computer is in operation.
  
  Over recent months this habit has caused havoc at the UK customer
  assistance centre of Stratus in downtown Hounslow, Middlesex.
  
  All Stratus computers sold in the UK are linked to the centre by autodial
  modem. In the case of any part apparently 'failing', red lights flash
  in the centre and the requisite replacement is hastily dispatched,
  complete with service engineer.
  
  With the boom in fault-tolerant sales as financial institutions geared
  up for Big Bang, the 'cry wolf' situation began to get out of hand.
  Desperate engineers have now solved the problem by placing a timing delay
  in the alarm system to allow sticky fingered stockbrokers time to put the
  board back.
  
  With computer-based dealing starting for real this week and keeping
  everyone in the financial institutions well occupied, Backbytes is sure
  that the problem will disappear anyway.

My father once told me about a semi-truck that was being used to test an
experimental microprocessor-controlled engine.  Apparently the micro would
crash (the computer, not the truck) whenever the truck was driven near the
local airport.  It was finally determined that the cause was EMI from a radar
transmitter at the airport.  Fortunately, when the micro crashed the engine
simply died, although one can easily imagine worse consequences.

I'm told that they now test their experimental systems by simply driving
them past the Voice of America transmitter near Cincinnati.  If the
system can operate under the conditions there, then they believe that it
should operate almost anywhere!

On Monday, 6 October 1986, the British air traffic control system was put
into manual backup mode by the crash of an IBM 9020D system that was
responsible for flight-plan data.  The computer in the London ATC Centre at
West Drayton (near Heathrow) crashed and was down for two hours -- with
traffic at Heathrow, Gatwick, and Manchester (among others) encountering
delays of up to six hours.  Because this system is also used by the military
air-traffic control system in West Drayton, British defenses were also
affected.

Overnight, ATC computer staff ``had loaded a new version of the main program
containing routine updates.  Software for running air-traffic control has to
be changed regularly to take account of new routes, aircraft types and
operating procedures for controllers.'' (Major updates are done once a year
at the London center.)  ``The changeover to a "new load" is normally a
tricky business.''  (One million lines of code run on a six-processor
system, networked with at least 10 other systems.)  

Unknown to the system programming staff, the software contained an
"unexpected flaw".  ``The centre was planning to connect an additional
computer to the existing 9020D complex.  Provision for the machine had been
made in the new software.  But that morning the computer was not connected
to the 9020D system.  Unaware of this, the program began collecting data
which should have been sent to the non-existent computer.  Data backed up
until alarms were sounded and supervisors decided to stop the system.  Staff
raced to adjust the 9020D and reload the old software.  Two hours later, the
machine was back in action.''  Meanwhile, operation reverted to the manual
flight-strip operation.

There was an item in [the 6 Nov 1986] Guardian about the same report that my
[earlier] submission described, so I can give you a better reference. The
report is called "Computer Security in Practice" and is published by the
Risk Management Services division of Hogg Robinson Ltd. who are a firm of
insurance brokers and presumably have an office in London.

The Guardian article paints a bleak picture of just how ill-prepared for
disaster the 50 or so companies visited are. 80% are not adequately
protected against fire, 96% are not protected against flood, (the two
exceptions had only installed detectors after sustaining water damage
previously), 70% don't have a stand-by power supply, 97% don't have enough
stand-by power to keep the user areas going as well as the hardware, etc.
Only 4% had fully calculated the cost of a disaster while 6% thought they
had a plan but either couldn't find it or admitted that it was hopelessly
out of date.

The article concluded with the observation that if these findings were
typical, most companies were doing the equivalent of walking across the
North Circular* with their eyes shut. However, Hogg-Robinson thought that
these results were probably not typical because at least these firms had
asked for a security risk audit. What about all the others?

* For the benefit of American readers who have not driven in London,
I should explain that the North Circular is a notorious inner ring-road.

I would be interested to know of any similar studies of American companies.

    whether the presence of two simultaneous messages from Newcastle to

  REVISED SUMMARY ITEM FOR RISKS-4.1:
  $!! USS Liberty:  34 dead; injured; 3 warnings to withdraw lost? (SEN 11 5) 

There was a story, I believe in the Atlantic two years ago, giving some sort
of "official" Israeli explanation (as told by two highly respected Israeli
reporters) of how the Israelis came to "accidently" attack the USS Liberty,
involving sad coincidence after coincidence on their side, with things like
the properly identified US ship on the war map had its flag put aside
temporarily by General X, and then General Y took his place at that point,
and other such things.  While their version is almost certainly a complete
crock, it is intriguing that breakdowns in protocol are so freely invoked as
cover stories.

(Is this a new brand of computer/systems meta-risk?  That is, have we become
so inured to "computer error" that we will take such as an excuse blindly?
Note that I am not referring to using the computer as a scapegoat to avoid
blaming humans, just because there happened to be a computer in the
pipeline.  I wonder whether making a computer the catchall wholecloth
scapegoat on the principle that no one would check for the real story has
become SOP?)

In the long long run, by the way, the USS Liberty and the USS Pueblo
incident led to the scrapping of NSA's spy ship program, with unknowable
consequences.  Presumably the development of spy satellites and the like
filled the gap, but again, who really knows.  Trying to measure the risks
associated with intelligence can be well nigh impossible.

Actually, breakdowns in protocol are common in diplomacy.  There was a flap
some years ago about an anti-Israel vote by the US in the UN that was blamed
on such.  Cryptographic failure could have been responsible, but that would
never be admitted.

Speaking of which, successful cryptanalysis can lead to striking diplomatic
victories in sensitive treaties.  Of course, the military impact of
cryptanalysis is potentially unlimited.

These particular incidents do not really involve computers per se, although
the mentality is identical.

This past week, a rather bizarre attempt to annoy NSA via computer has
begun on USENET.  Several people have started inserting cute words like
"crypt" or "terror" or "CIA" in their signatures in an attempt to over-
load NSA's automatic grep for cute words in overseas traffic.  Consider-
ing the minuteness of the added load, and the likelihood that NSA already
filters out obvious traffic like the net, the effort is nothing more than
a good old fashioned American form of protest.  Even though it is using
(a trivial amount of) OPM to pay for a symbolic sabotage, I love it.

But obviously uglier scenarios can be imagined.  Is a grep-bomb possible?

We just installed some SUN workstations (UNIX 4.2bsd) connected to 
an ethernet using TCP/IP protocols. 

We learned from the stanford breakin to be extremely careful when using
".rhosts". So we only entered such workstations into ".rhosts" located
in the office of trusted users.

One night a student operating a SINIX workstation experimented with
TCP/IP. He configured his machine to use the IP address of a trusted
host and he entered the username of a trusted user into "/etc/passwd" 
of his maschine. Then he rlogin'ed into a SUN-workstation as a trusted user.

==&gt; Do not use ".rhosts" unless you have EVERY host and EVERY communication
    path totally under control!

&gt; From: Christopher C. Stacy &lt;CSTACY@JASPER.Palladian.COM&gt;
&gt; Subject: Computers and Medical Charts
&gt; 
&gt; So, the opinion of one medical records administrator seems to concur with
&gt; that of Dr. Tessler; the people at that hospital probably were over-reacting
&gt; inappropriately. [...] this situation presents the familiar risk of
&gt; paranoid confusion.

	In my (limited) experience, the other problem is more common;
people under-reacting inappropriately to the security risks of storing data
in computers.  We are a biological research lab and use our computer
systems to store everything from mundane experimental results to patent
applications.  Somehow, people have gotten the impression that once it's in
the computer, it's safe.  It's hard enough to convince everybody to keep
their password secret, let alone read-protect their files or (God forbid!)
think about encryption or off-line storage when appropriate.  Even when we
had a rather sophisticated breakin a couple of months ago, and I sent
around what I intended to be a scare-the-blank-out-of-them memo, people
still trust the machine to safeguard their data more than is probably
prudent.

	It gets worse. There was recently an (apparently unrelated)
incident involving researchers at two nearby research institutes where one
researcher (call him thief) stole some important data from a competitor
(victim).  I got the original story from a mutual competitor of those two
who works here (fool).  When I spoke with victim to get the whole story, he
admitted it was purely his fault.  Victim was 1) using the same system as
thief to store his data and 2) didn't read-protect his files because he
wanted certain other people to be able to read them (not thief or fool,
however).  I then went back to fool and told him what had happened and
urged him to take at least some simple precautions -- change his password
for example.  He refused, saying that 1) he thought his data was safe
enough and 2) he couldn't imagine that anybody would/could break in.  Even
when I reminded fool that he had just had a big fight with one of his
post-docs and ended up firing the post-doc, he wouldn't believe me that
there might be people out there with the motive and capability to steal or
destroy his data!

	So, what am I supposed to do?  Here we have a person who, in the
face of overwhelming evidence that his data might be in peril, insists on
clinging to his belief that if it's in the computer, it must be safe.  In
my opinion, this is a far more dangerous situation than what CSTACY@JASPER
reports.

Since the well-known ARPANET breakdown is one of the RISKS archive items,
I was wondering if anyone on the list could contribute information about
what seemed to have been a DDN (or maybe just MILNET?) breakdown that
happened yesterday, 6 Nov 86? All I know of it was that our data
communications people got a call from Army Communications to let them
know that the reason we were off the net was not just a local area or
in-house problem, but some sort of general malaise or trouble all over
the network. I know no more details as to the nature or true extent of
the problem(s) and would like to read details or at least a description
of the symptoms. It was cleared up within hours, so was not as severe as
the historic ARPANET collapse, but it would probably be worthy of
mention in RISKS.

I couldn't resist, after reading M. Minow's quoting of the redoubtable Burgess.

  Headline:  "Reporters Should Cultivate the Use of the Fountain Pen"

  "In a recent address delivered at Columbia University, Mr. Edward W.
  Townsend, newspaper and magazine writer and Congressman, expressed the
  opinion that it was a misfortune that the typewriter had come to be so
  generally used in newspaper rooms, because it made the translation of
  thought into copy somewhat too easy.  The view point is that the somewhat
  slower and more careful handwriting of any article or news item is better,
  clearer thought and is always better constructed when written with a
  fountain pen than when rambled off on a typewriter..."

This from the "Pen Prophet", the house organ of the Waterman pen company,
Volume XII, No. 1, June 1914.  So there, Red Smith, Ernie Pyle, and E. B.
White.

Summary: Brazilian laws require proof of voting. People NEED those cards.
To: seismo!csl.sri.com!risks

This situation involving computers is severe due to Brazil's laws, with
which most of the RISKS readers are undoubtedly not familiar.

The "frayed tempers" due to not getting the "essential voting card" in
Brazil are not simply because everyone likes to vote.  Everyone MUST vote in
Brazil.  Proof of recent voting is one of the required legal documents for
several situations, including simply getting a job.  Those missing voting
registration cards are the prerequisite to being able to vote and be a
law-abiding citizen qualified to live a normal life.  (My wife is from
Brazil and had to carry those documents.)

&gt;  Programmers overlooked that twins are born on the same day to the same
&gt;  parents. Consequently, the voting rights of an estimated 70,000 twins
&gt;  were cancelled. The Federal Electoral Tribunal in Brasilia is currently
&gt;  wading through 140,000 appeals, including the case of a certain Jose
&gt;  Francisco, who says all his 14 brothers were baptised with identical
&gt;  names.

All this is familiar to analysts and programmers.  The voting documents
were formerly handled by humans who modified the processing procedure
as required by common sense and local situations ("Yeah, I know Jose
Francisco.  All 14 were here last year, I still have to see 6 of them this
year.")  The written procedures are undoubtedly what guided the programmers.
If the implementation schedule was the same for the whole country, it is
little wonder that many exceptions were found at the same time.

    From: weemba at brahms.berkeley.edu (Matthew P Wiener)

    Several people have started inserting cute words like
    "crypt" or "terror" or "CIA" in their signatures in an attempt to over-
    load NSA's automatic grep for cute words in overseas traffic.  Consider-
    ing the minuteness of the added load, and the likelihood that NSA already
    filters out obvious traffic like the net...

That would be inconsistent with the oft-repeated claims that NSA
monitors ALL overseas telephone calls.  I have been told (someone pls
confirm or deny?) that voice recognition technology is good enough
that given Crays on an NSA budget, such a feat is possible when you
are looking for certain key words, and that recognition can be done on
a very limited vocabulary independent of speaker.

Comments?

Of course they intercept the net, but if you were snooping around through

Security on an Ethernet is a very tricky business. If you use the Berkeley
rhosts scheme, it is easy to spoof someone else's ip address, although there
is some code in Berkeley Unix that detects when someone is impersonating
you, the message only comes out on the system console. And if the bad guy
makes your machine crash while you are away, no one will be the wiser.

If you ban rhosts and only allow ftp and telnet, you are vulnerable
to people grabbing packets off the Ethernet and getting your password.

Which is worse? Would you rather freeze to death or burn to death?
I don't know if it matters. I think that if security matters, it
would be best not to let machines you don't trust on your Ethernet.

Sun proposed an interesting scheme at the last Usenix. Two machines that
wanted to communicate would use an encrypted timestamp on each packet as
authentication. This assumes, of course, that the two machines have
synchronized their clocks and that they have a common key no one else knows.
(their scheme included a key distribution method which I will not discuss
here) There is also a performance penalty. They did some back of the
envelope calculations showing it would be acceptable in many cases.

Is it unreasonable to put machines you don't trust on another Ethernet, 
with a router between your group and them?

   From: Douglas Humphrey &lt;deh at eneevax.umd.edu&gt;
   To LIN : In response to a message, you state that none of the anti-SDI
            folk ever stated that the software had to be perfect. I have 
            heard constantly in both the widely read (Washington Post) and
            limited (?) distribution industry media (Aviation Leak and 
            Space Mythology) SDI critics that conte[x]t that it must be perfect
            or it is useless. I don't bel[ie]ve this, and I would hope you
            don't either, but saying that the whole must be perfect 
            certainly implies that the parts must be perfect.

Please give a citation. The only place I have ever seen a statement about
required "perfection" came in an article written by James Fletcher, of the
Fletcher Commission, who clearly states that "an enormous and error-free
program" would be required.  Fletcher hardly counts as a critic.

                        [I held this one up hoping for a response...  PGN]

I don't deny that you have heard what you say you have heard, but the
only inference I can draw is that neither the Post nor AWAST have
correctly reported the critics' position.

What critics DO say is that you can never know if BMD software will work in
the absence of realistic testing.  KNOWING that a program will work properly
without error is a different, and more demanding, condition than whether or
not it *actually* will if put to the test.  Moreover, critics do not have
faith that it is possible to predict all of the ways that the Soviets might
attack; we do believe that the Soviets *might* be able to attack in a way
that would result in catastrophic failure.

On the general issue of "perfection", critics believe that the statement of
mission requirements comes from the President of the United States and the
Secretary of Defense, who assert that SDI is a way to protect everybody
against nuclear ballistic missiles.  They get funding from Congress on that
claim, and they present it to the American people that way.  If they want to
use it for something else, such as improving the ability of the U.S. to
retaliate, then let them say so.  Until the proponents admit POLITICALLY
that their goal is infeasible, critics have a responsibility to confront
them with their fallacies.  You may acknowledge that their goal is
infeasible, in which case we can argue about what goals are feasible, but
you are not the President.  If you want to criticize someone for asserting
perfection, dump on the highest levels of the Administration, because they
are the ones that set the terms of the debate.
 
   [As usual, we tread some fine lines, e.g., among technically motivated 
    nonpolitical arguments, nontechically motivated political arguments, etc.
    Just as we often note that RISKS issues are holistic system issues, it
    is risky to try to talk of just the technical arguments in isolation.
    Although RISKS seeks to avoid political issues, this one is metapolitical 
    and is closely intertwined with technological evaluations.   PGN]

In RISKS 4.4, Martin Minow makes the point that computerization makes
it easier to substitute quantity for quality in our writing.  I would
go one step farther and say that the easy access to information made
possible by computer systems has also degraded our ability (or at least
our desire) to gain and retain knowledge.

The following is excerpted from an essay entitled "Look it up!
Check it out!" by Jacques Barzun in the Autumn 1986 *American Scholar.*

  ``... the age of ready reference is one in which knowledge inevitably
  declines into information.  The master of so much packaged stuff needs to
  grasp context or meaning much less than his forebears:  he can always look
  it up.  His live memory is otherwise engaged anyway, full of the arbitrary
  names, initials, and code numbers essential to carrying on daily life.  He
  can be vague about the rest: he can always check it out.

  ``... But what we are experiencing is not the knowledge explosion so often 
  boasted of; it is a torrent of information, made possible by first reducing
  the known to compact form and then bulking it up again -- adding water.
  That is why the product so often tastes like dried soup.''

As computer scientists, I think we find it all too easy to divide
and compartmentalize information as we see fit.  As I see it, one
of the greatest risks of widespread computing is that we'll all stop
learning.  We've got spelling checkers, so why bother learning to
spell?  We've got calculators and home computers, so why bother learning
any math?  We've got electronic mail and conferencing, so why bother
to learn or practice the art of public speaking?  Are we reaching the
point where being an expert simply means having a large computer
database, as opposed to years of learning and knowledge?  I don't
think we're there yet, but I fear that our society's heavy emphasis on
"information" and computing might be leading us there.

The interesting article by Anthony Burgess reproduced in RISKS-4.4 reminded
me that when the first lap-top computers were introduced a few years ago,
some professional writers noticed that their sentences were becoming shorter
and their paragraphs chunkier, as they relied on a 40-column, 8-line display
(e.g.)  when composing texts.  Has this really been cured by newer
technology?  Or is our familiar 80x25 model just as likely to have an
adverse impact on writing style?

&gt;  "How Fred lets the fraudsters in" (c) Newspaper Publishing PLC
                                     ^^^ 
Considering the frequency with which we see this half-circled c used as an
ASCII replacement for the genuine circled c, it is obvious that a lot of
people have let their primitive keyboards delude them into a non-copyright.
("Copyright", spelled out, takes longer than "(c)", but it has legal standing.)

&gt;  Passwords are particularly vulnerable when they remain unchanged for a long
&gt;  time.  The chairman of one major company the auditors investigated had kept
&gt;  the same password for five years. It was "chairman".

This reminds me of the WWII story in Feynman's book about the hot-shot
military big boss with his fancy-dancy super-safe: the combination was never
changed from the factory original.  "The more things change, the more they
stay the same."

&gt;Now, I am being accused of taking confidential information out of the
&gt;hospital in the form of patient records and doctors names! All I had on the
&gt;computer were my notes. The paranoid medical staff is afraid that having
&gt;this information in my "COMPUTER" is dangerous, [...]
&gt;Pretty amazing paranoia, huh? Do people really still fear computers this way?

In this situation, it strikes me as typical computer ignorance.  But in
general, the use of a computer as opposed to a legal pad leads to more
security problems.  Handwritten notes are both unmistakeable as such and are
naturally limited in content.  (I assume this is old hat to RISKers.)

From LA Times, Saturday, November 8, 1986:

G.C. Blodgett, a living legend as an outdoorsman in New England, drives a
car to his favorite fishing spots from his home in West Babylon, Mass., but
he almost quit this year when his insurance bill arrived.  His son told the
Providence Journal: "He wanted to know why the premium was three times as
much as the previous year.  So we called the insurance company, and after a
while, the fellow there came back laughing and explained that their computer
calculated premiums for drivers up to 100 years old.  After that, it started
at the beginning again, so he was being charged the premium of a teen-ager."

Blodgett is 101.

&gt; The Guardian article paints a bleak picture of just how ill-prepared for
&gt; disaster the 50 or so companies visited are. 80% are not adequately
&gt; protected against fire, 96% are not protected against flood, (the two
&gt; exceptions had only installed detectors after sustaining water damage
&gt; previously), 70% don't have a stand-by power supply, ...

It is worth noting that even the companies which theoretically *are*
prepared may find their preparations wasted in practice.  The first NYC
blackout caught a number of hospitals with, so to speak, their pants down.
Things like emergency generators with electric starters!  Another example
that I remember was a place that had a fine emergency generator, started
up properly and actually ran for a while.  Trouble was, it was in the
basement, which was below the local water table and was kept dry by pumps
running continuously.  You guessed it, the pumps weren't on the emergency
power.  The only people who had reliable power throughout the blackout
were the professional paranoids:  the military and the phone company.

It might be worth finding out whether there was any attempt to compile a
list of such experiences from that blackout.  I heard about this by chance.

(The electrically-started-generator problem was larger than it looked.
Modern power plants need startup power for things like pumps and control
systems.  No need for emergency generators, you can always get startup
power from the network.  But what do you do when the *whole* network is
down?  A combination of luck and improvisation sufficed that time.)

I think that the problem was much further down the line.   Lindsay

        more explicit, but then I would be guilty of being a Canard Liner.

        meaningful, I did not want to duck it.  (An aquacktive nuisance.)

In the course of catching up on Flight International (the British analog to
Aviation Leak), I ran across an interesting item in the 7 June 1986 issue.
The UK Ministry of Defence officially admitted that a British helicopter,
shot down in the Falklands War with all four aboard killed, was downed by
a Sea Dart missile from a British destroyer.  On 6 June 1982, HMS Cardiff
reported shooting down an Argentine helicopter flying in darkness toward
Port Stanley.  It was actually a British Army Gazelle on a resupply flight
between Darwin and Mount Pleasant.  The lack of Argentine wreckage and
the coincidence of timing were noticed, but a forensic investigation was
unable to establish a firm connection.  Forensic tests in the last year or
so have pretty much settled the question.  MoD apparently won't discuss
how the misidentification occurred.

(This sort of thing is far more common in combat than most people think.  In
WW2 there was a standing joke about how antiaircraft gunners decided whether an
aircraft was friendly or hostile:  approaching = hostile, receding = friendly.)

Considering the amount of duties undertaken by micros in today's
automobiles, I can only conclude that it is a case of "Because we can do
it".  Sure, computer controlled fuel injection is very efficient and is a
good idea.  But my brother just bought a new BMW with all sorts of standard
stuff on it.  It will tell you the outside temperature, warn you when the
temp is low enough that the roads are likely to be icy, etc. The radio is
more complicated than the oil pressure, water temperature indications.

I am also amazed at the fact that one can buy a car with totally digital
instrumentation. What possible advantage can there be to all of this?

I noted a while back that when boosting the newer car, one runs the risk of
blowing any computer that may be on board due to power surges.  These things
cost about $1000 to replace.  Most mechanics nowadays are trained to identify
the faulty module and replace it without trying to find the bad component.

I think that the average driver loves all the pretty lights but doesn't
usually use all his instruments anyway.  For one thing, most drivers seem to
be able to handle very little at one time and it is all they can do to keep
the car between the lines.  They don't need more distractions provided by
today's auto-toys.

  &gt; As I see it, one of the greatest risks of widespread computing is that
  &gt; we'll all stop learning...

Most of the time, people learn things because someone (often the person
herself) thinks the things are useful.  So, for instance, very few Americans
this decade know a whole lot about the care and tending of a horse or about the
growing seasons of various plants, despite the fact that these were vital facts
for much of the American population a century or two ago.  Mathematics (e.g.,
things like algebra and basic set theory) have become a lot more popular.  
As the environment changes, the set of things chosen as "essential knowledge"
changes.  We may expect to see this continue, and a good thing too.  I don't
*want* to know a lot about mucking out stables.

Some might argue that some things are good to learn in and of themselves.
I'd agree for some areas (e.g., the arts), and disagree for others (e.g.,
spelling).

  &gt; Are we reaching the point where being an expert simply means having a large
  &gt; computer database, as opposed to years of learning and knowledge?

I hope not.  We might be reaching the point where being an expert means having
a large computer database as well as knowing the subject well.  This is not
particularly different in character from having a large physical library in
one's area of expertise, which most experts do.  Part of the point of expertise
it that one can do things that aren't in one's library or database.

  &gt; I don't think we're there yet, but I fear that our society's heavy
  &gt; emphasis on "information" and computing might be leading us there.

Possibly so.  I've noticed a general feeling that computer answers are more to
be trusted than human ones.

    As I see it, one of the greatest risks of widespread computing is that
    we'll all stop learning.  We've got spelling checkers, so why bother
    learning to spell?...

It's an old fear.  It was said about Xeroxing -- and who has not had the
experience of copying an article in the hopes that its information would
seep from the file cabinet to the brain?  It was said about books and
printing -- and who has not bought a book without the same experience.  It
was apparently even said about writing -- and who has not wished that (s)he
could speak as well as (s)he could write?

That's not to say that all these fears are unjustified.  But it is not
new with the advent of computers.

Yes, spelling checkers are allowing students to get by without learning to
spell -- *and the schools are endorsing that trend*! I have yet (slight
hyperbole here) to get over the words I heard three years ago from our
oldest son's seventh-grade English teacher (yes, "English").  It was during
the beginning-of-the-year parents' orientation meeting where we have the
opportunity to meet all the teachers and hear their plans for the year.  I
can't remember the precise context any more, but I think we had asked some
kind of question about whether she took spelling into consideration in
grading compositions.  The answer was roughly this:  "Not very much -- after
all, all these kids will be using word processors in the future and won't
have to know how to spell."  Fortunately this view was not shared by most of
the rest of the teachers.  (The school district, by the way, and the
particular junior high itself, is among the top few percent in the country,
as judged by scores on the SAT and the various awards it has received.)

I scored big on some DEC call options recently.  I used the proceeds to
purchase an expensive 87 turbo mazda RX-7.  After driving it for a month I
realized my driver's license had been expired for a year.  Kentucky sends you
a post card when it is time to renew.  I simply assumed that mine got lost
somehow and went downtown to renew.  They took my license and told me it was
suspended in February of 85! Arg! Since my license was suspended I did not
get a renewal notice.

The clerk was very helpful and gave me a phone number to call.  I called the
number and the gentleman on the other end told me that because my license
was issued under an older system, it would be awhile before he could
retrieve my record and tell me why the suspension occurred.  The State was
switching over to a social security number based system, and evidently the
old system existed only in hard copy form.  He then said, "By the way, may I
have your social security number?  Please call us back after lunch and we
should have some information for you."

I called back and found out that a speeding ticket obtained in February of
85 had pushed me to the limit of "points" and that the state had sent me a
notice to appear at court to plead my case.  If I had shown up, the judge
would have given me "traffic school" and I would have kept my license.  I
never received any notice.  I didn't show up in court so they suspended my
license for 6 months in retaliation.  I asked the clerk on the phone to tell
me where they sent the notice.  He said "6103 glimmer way apartment 4".
After finding out what the procedure for getting my license back was I
thanked the clerk for his assistance.

(Plot thickens here) In 1981 I lived at 8103 glimmer way apartment 4.  In
1982 I moved from there, and sent the state a letter informing them of my
change in address.  I did not include my social security number.  Since the
state was converting from an older system to the new SSN based system the
address change did not get made.  Evidently, they just re-entered all the
data from the old system to the new system and mis-keyed my address.  State
law states that my obligation was to inform them of a change in address.

So, bottom line, I was driving from March 85 to November 86 with a suspended
driver's license.  I continued to pay auto insurance.  I rented cars during
several business trips (I consult on the side).  I get another(!) speeding
ticket on the interstate.  The officer called in to "run" my license, but
since it was "old-system" they didn't give him the info that I was
suspended.  I drove off, paid the fine, never heard anything.  My car was
towed twice for being parked improperly, I paid the fines, showed my
license, got the car back twice.

Here is the real kicker.  My insurance company states clearly that they are
not liable if I have an accident without a valid driver's license.  The loan
on the unfunded portion of my sleek black RX-7 states that if I don't
maintain insurance I can be sued for the loan.  What if....I had gotten in
my RX-7 and wiped out some people and the car?  I'd have been found to be in
violation of the law, been denied insurance coverage, lost the funds I put
in to the car, and still been liable for the remaining portion of the loan I
took out!!!!

Well I have my license back now, smiling in my RX-7 (insured).  I feel VERY
lucky that nothing happened to me.  The total cost for me to get out of this
one was $38! It makes me wonder if there others are in the same boat (massive 
personal liability indirectly induced by a change from one computer record
system to another).  I just fell through the cracks and didn't even know it.

First some background:  The Westpac Bank installed a new software system
for its ATM's which did not do proper checking.  Thus it allowed people
to withdraw more than the daily maximum allowed ($200).  It even allowed
the withdrawl of more than was held in the account.  The ATM's were
supposed to allow customers of the Commonwealth Bank to access their
accounts, but this access was denied by the new software.

From "The Canberra Times", Tuesday, June 16, 1987.

BANK LOSES HEAVILY IN AUTO-TELLER 'HICCUP'
------------------------------------------

Westpac's recent automatic-teller-machine "hiccup" cost the bank more than a
red face.  According to Westpac's electronic banking manager, Mr Bill Paget,
the bank would lose several hundred thousand dollars of overdrawn cash.

Westpac's troubles began on Saturday, May 30, when programmers installed the
IMS version 2.2 of IBM's software.  The following Thursday, after a week
long crisis, Westpac decided to close all its automatic tellers throughout
Australia, suspecting widespread fraud.  Because of the costs of recovering
debts, Mr Paget said the bank would probably not take legal action to get
its money back from people who were unable to repay it.

The Federal Treasury ordered an immediate inquiry on the situation as it
developed.  "We were concerned for the cardholder where there was a
technical malfunction and the cardholder lost money," a Treasury official
said.  However he warned that the Treasury might get involved again if
legitimate customers had rights abused during that period.

It seems the "hiccup" was more extensive than first reported.  "Computing
Australia" was told by Mr John Kosh, assistant manager of electronic banking
for the Commonwealth Bank, that the Westpac system was malfuctioning for the
whole of the week before Westpac closed the machines.

Because of this, he said, Commonwealth cardholders had been unable to use
Westpac automatic tellers.  At first, the Commonwealth believed it to be a
communications problem.  "We didn't know what was happening," he said.

The SWIFT network for the international transfer of funds was also hit, with
Westpac unable to send funds overseas while the host computer was down.  Mr
Paget said this caused "some inconvenience" to corporate customers.

Westpac has blamed insufficient software testing for the disaster and
maintains it will reinstall the offending software later.  Mr Paget admitted
that "somehow or other the testing didn't cover the problem".

"The new software is back with the technicians:  we're saying we don't like
what happened, and we don't want this to happen again," he said.  "There's
no doubt it will go back in at some stage, but they've got to find out why
it didn't work and try to work out how to fix it.  From where I sit, we'll
be looking at test upon test upon test." 

He said Westpac would not seek compensation from IBM.  "When you are in a
long term relationship with a supplier, this is going to happen," Mr Paget
said.  "Our people were involved with the software all the way along.  We
have to be big boys and live with it."

Although stories about bank ATM's swallowing customer's money are common
enough, you don't see too many stories about the opposite situation
happening.  Here is a story from the "Sydney Morning Herald" (Sydney,
Australia) dated Friday 5th June:

  The day Westpac's computer gave away money

  Westpac Banking Corporation is believed to have lost millions of dollars
  in international transactions, and will be forced to recover an undisclosed
  amount from customers who withdrew unauthorised cash from automatic teller
  machines, following a serious fault in the bank's computer system.

  A major failure in a new software system introduced last weekend forced
  the closure of all the bank's 650 automatic teller machines (ATMs) across
  Australia yesterday.  The fault also affected other ATMs with which the
  Westpac computer is linked.

  After the fault developed earlier in the week, customers suddenly found
  themselves able to make multiple withdrawals of amounts beyond the usual
  daily limit of $200, even if the account held no money.  They were also able
  to withdraw from cheque accounts they did not have.

The article went on to describe how "normally impoverished inner-city types
(were) suddenly treating themselves to cocktails in expensive restaurants
and buying new clothes at the QVB (a trendy boutique)", and that the SWIFT
system (Society of Worldwide International Financial Transactions) was
inaccessible.  However, the bank denies losing millions of dollars this way.

Apparently, parts of the new software could not cope with carrying three or
four times the number of transactions they had been tested for, and the ATMs
were forced to work in isolation, unable to communicate with the host
processor.  This raises a few important points:

1) Why was the real-life situation so much worse than what had
   been expected?  Don't banks test software until it fails?

2) Why were the ATMs permitted to work on their own, happily
   dispensing cash from empty accounts?

And more importantly ...

3) Assuming these ATMs have an internal audit trail, how much reliance can
   be place on them, in order to recover the money from customers who
   (knowingly) defrauded them?  I can see the court case now:

   "But, m'lud, Westpac has ALREADY ADMITTED that its software was
   at fault.  How can we trust these little bits of paper inside
   their machine, claiming that my client had defrauded them?"

ATMs *DO* have an internal audit trail, don't they?

[...] Since then they have been running large ads in the newspapers with a
funny drawing of an ATM with 'HIC' coming from its dispenser slot.

Westpac tried the new version of IMS2 against their test data transactions
but not against a load approximating anything like the actual loads. (One of
my students, who works with another of the Big Four banks, says that his bank
always tests against live load levels before they bring in changes: perhaps
reasonable validation does take place sometimes)

The UK Consumers' Association magazine Which? has the following cautionary
tale about use of credit cards [precis].
	
   "Sally Allen booked into a hotel near Paris for the night. As well as
taking her passport overnight, the hotel asked for her Access card. They
took an imprint on a payment voucher, even though she had no intention of
paying by Access, explaining that it was a safeguard against non-payment of
her bill."

   "When she returned home and tried to use her Access card she was refused
credit, even though she had next to nothing charged on her card. She
contacted Access and demanded an explanation. Apparently the hotel in France
had *reserved credit* on her account for the cost of her stay, and been
given an authorisation number from the Access computer in the UK. The amount
reserved had been deducted from her credit limit. The only way her credit
could be restored was for the hotel to contact them, and to cancel the
transaction. She wrote to the hotel immediately, but it took six weeks for
the credit to be restored."

   Which? reports that Access and Visa both think the hotel was operating
outside the agreed conditions of use, but that because they have no direct
contract with the French hotel, all they can do is lobby their respective
international organisations (Mastercard and Visa International) for a ban.

Anybody else come across this problem of uncancelled "transactions"?

It seems very wrong that someone can screw up your credit without
you ever signing or agreeing anything, and that the matter can't be
put right because of the national boundaries involved.

     I've been told that seven terrorists (belonging to Action Directe?)
were recently caught in France after the police took possession of an
electronic wrist-watch/calculator in which one of the terrorists had stored
a set of telephone numbers. Can anybody confirm this, and provide details? I
don't recall discussion in RISKS of any such incident, and its a nice Gallic
equivalent to the Irangate archived messages incident, if it's true.

Last night I had the pleasure(?) of trying out United Air Lines new
O'Hare terminal.  The terminal is extremely modern, complete with
computerized departure signs for each gate (in a red color that can't
be read when the sun backlights it!)  In the closet behind each gate
check-in counter there is an IBM PC (I think) with a menu driven
program used to set the information on the departure sign.
Unfortunately, any gate computer can control any gate sign, and the
result is that a simple operator error can cause lots of trouble.
In particular, last night, while I watched, the Pittsburgh flight
indicated behind the counter turned magically into one for Columbus.

I should also point out that the low tech solution of a sign board to
be slipped into a slot took only about 30 seconds per flight
changeover.  I watched the attendent take almost 5 minutes to
changeover under the new and improved high-tech solution.  (To be fair,
the terminal has only been operating since Monday.)

Aside: if you are unfortunate enough to have to connect from United
gates E-F to United gates B, plan on missing your flight unless you've
added an extra 15-20 minutes for the hike.  The terminal won't be fully
operational until 1989, though much UAL operations will switch there in
August of this year.

  "N.J. Computer Gives Drivers the Business

  "Trenton, N.J. - Hundreds of drivers who notified Department of Motor
  Vehicles last month of new addresses found that a computer had changed
  their names -- to Watkins Leasing Co.

  "The computer error has been corrected and new address labels are being
  sent this week to all of the drivers affected, a department spokesman said.

  "Watkins Leasing Co. is a truck dealership and leasing concern with
  offices in Chester, PA and Wilmington and Harrington, Del."

Interesting. Why Watkins Leasing Co since apparently Watkins isn't even
located in New Jersey???  JohnM

On 18 May 87 a demonstrator flight of the McDonnell Douglas UHB twin-jet
(with one GE prototype unducted fan engine) was cut short when a cockpit
light indicated a potential problem with the UDF engine.  The warning was
triggered by a pressure sensor when the aircraft climbed above 12,000 feet.
Subsequent testing showed there was a software error in the annunciation logic.

A short tutorial on aircraft transponders...

In RISKS 5:2 Roy Smith asks:

&gt;&gt; ...why isn't the plane part of the info sent by the on-board transponder?
&gt;&gt; Aren't these id's simply the flight numbers assigned by the airlines?  Why
&gt;&gt; should it require any manual intervention to assign an id to a blip?

The transponder presently in use by all aircraft in the US has been around
for many years.  It has the ability to:
 
- Receive an unaddressed query pulse from a ground radar site and respond
  with a pulse of its own. 

- Include with its response the transponder code set by the pilot.  (This
  is the code which was incorrectly assigned at O'Hare.)  The code is 
  a 4-digit octal number, and has no relationship to the aircraft registration
  number or the (airline-assigned) flight number.
 
- Report if a special button (marked IDENTIFICATION) has been pressed within 
  the past few seconds.  This can be used by a controller to positively
  identify an aircraft, since its receipt causes the radar display to change
  the shape of the blip which represents the return.
 
- Report the pressure altitude of the aircraft, referenced to a barometer 
  setting of 29.92" Hg.  This ability is not required in low-altitude
  flights and is an extra-cost feature.
 
Work is being completed by the FAA on a replacement for the present transponder
design.  The new transponders (called "Mode S") will include a permanently-
assigned identification, unique to the aircraft, which will be transmitted
along with the other data when the transponder decodes a query.  Until the
Mode S gear comes into use, however, we are still limited to a transponder
code address space of 4096 discrete codes to identify an aircraft.
 
The effective address space is smaller, since several blocks of 100(8) are
reserved for special purpose.  Code 1200 is the general VFR (visual, not
under radar control) code; 75xx, 76xx, and 77xx are emergency codes,
and so forth.
 
A feature of most radar display systems is the ability to use the transponder
codes to DE-select a return so that a controller's display does not show the 
transponder data for aircraft not under his/her jurisdiction.  Such aircraft
might be separated horizontally (in another controller's sector) or vertically
(as in an overflight above an airport).  In places like Southern California,
this can be used to suppress the clutter caused by VFR (code 1200) aircraft
which would otherwise obscure the returns of controlled aircraft.  It has
been reported (and denied) that the controller involved in the Cerritos crash
had suppressed the VFR returns such as that of the intruding Piper.
 
Yes, it would be nice if the system could set off alarms when the data
became ambiguous.  But at what point should it delay the alarm against
the possibility of a transient failure (e.g., the second aircraft might
have been changing the code setting and been on AA637's code just as the
radar beam swept past)?  A real problem in aviation system engineering is
the incredible number of alarms which some pilots consider to be a safety
risk in themselves since they can go off in combinations which distract
the aircrew.

There's an O*L*D joke about the pilot who was hauled up before a board
after landing his airplane with the landing gear still up.  His defence
was that the gear-up warning horn was so loud that he was distracted
from performing the "gear down and locked" item in his pre-landing checklist.

Before takeoff on an IFR (instrument flight rules) flight, an aircraft's
pilot is given a "squawk", a four octal digit code to enter into his
transponder.  This is also entered into the ATC system's computer so the
code returned by the transponder when interrogated by radar is automatically
translated into the airline and flight number displayed on the controller's
radar scope.

As there are 4096 possible codes and probably lots more aircraft flying IFR
than that, pilots sometimes have to change squawks in mid-flight when
going from one region to another.  And, as airlines have duplicate flight
numbers that range from one to four decimal digits, they can't use those
for their squawks.   [...]

VFR aircraft receiving terminal radar service also use this facility,
although they are only using it at the beginning and end of the flight.
Also, codes 75XX are reserved for hijacked aircraft, 76XX for those with
communication failures, and 77XX for those declaring emergencies, so
that the total number of squawks available is actually less than 4096.

I got an ad from Raytheon today for a Mil-Spec version of the VAX (built
under license from DEC).  It is described as an "extreme performance machine
which survives tactical levels of nuclear weapons effects (NWE)."

On a related note, the June 15, 1987 issue of the trade paper ELECTRONIC 
ENGINEERING TIMES has an article called "Reveille for Military ASICs" (by
Terry Costlow, pps. 1 and 16).  It notes "Radiation hardening has been
viewed largely as an aerospace application, but it is now being included in
smaller weapons that are being produced in higher volumes than one-of-a-kind
spacecraft. 'We're seeing more nuclear weapons being designed for tactical 
battlefield conditions.  In the past, rad-hard was just used in weapons like
intercontinental missiles.  We feel this may be a nice emerging niche', says
(semiconductor vendor) NCR's (director of marketing Patrick) Riley."

Nothing to do with computers, but a very important point for system
designers. I was reading a book the other day in which the author
mentions the pang of fear that struck him on a plane one day, when
he noticed that the screws holding the ashtray to the seat did not
match. He instantly thought "Is this how they fix the engines too??".

Moral: Attention to the cosmetic details can play a great part in re-assuring
users (no matter how falsely!).

I'm surprised that no one has mentioned the book ``Computer Power and Human

PROGRAM

On-Site Registration (8:00 - 9:00)

PLENARY SESSION (9:00 - 10:30)
  Robert Kahn and Terry Winograd with Gary Chapman

The featured speakers will discuss the role of funding on computer science
research.  How and why are projects selected for funding?  What are the
roles of the Department of Defense, civilian agencies and private sources?
Does it matter where research money comes from?

Robert Kahn is the founder of the non-profit Corporation for National
Research Initiatives, in Washington, D.C.  Until 1985, Kahn was director of
the Information Processing Techniques Office at the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

A few of you have received a UUCP message through "cbosgd" that intended to
demonstrate that systems are not really very secure and that it is easy to
bypass moderation on supposedly moderated news groups.  (The message in
question was written as a response to someone who thought that this might be
difficult!) The existence of that message should not surprise any readers of
RISKS, who by now have no trouble grasping the fact that there is no such
thing as complete security.  However, the message was sent not through
RISKS@CSL but through one of our innumerable redistribution points (and thus
was received by only a very small fraction of all RISKS readers).  The
possibility of doing that should not be a surprise, particularly in that
most local redistribution centers have been explicitly set up to be
automatic forwarders rather than requiring manual intervention.

A long time ago Dave Parnas objected to having his position papers on Star
Wars serialized in Soft-Eng@MIT-XX and circulated via netmail, partly
because there are no guarantees that the received message was actually
authentic.  (Crypto checksums could be used, although they create a new set
of vulnerabilities.)  Sooner or later someone will indeed post a bogus
message to the entire RISKS group, with fake authorship and bypassing my
moderation; I will then have to point out that I stated in RISKS-5.4 (and
earlier, as well) that it can of course be done.  (I have tried to use
TOPS-20 as sensibly as possible to make such immoderation nontrivial, but I
cannot seal off that possibility altogether.)  Besides, I would like to
believe that the RISKS community consists mostly of socially conscious and
thoughtful individuals, interested in learning and growing in awareness.

Careful RISKS readers must by now realize that I am probably the last person
in the world who would say that something is really secure -- I know that
NOTHING is, including the interposition (or imposition?) of RISKS moderation.  
I simply must rely on your sensitivity not to mount attacks.  We will soon
have to switch to a UNIX system on a Sun workstation as the RISKS source,
and at that point I would otherwise have to abandon all hope of moderation.

Telephone tidbits

[The Passive Aspect:]
 
No answer

University telephone users should be advised that when a University
telephone has been programmed for call forward busy/no answer, the caller
will hear three rings before the unanswered phone switches to its forwarded
number.  If that number is busy, however, the caller will not get a busy
signal but will continue to hear the ringing signal.  This is a problem with
the software for the system, according to the office of telecommunications,
for which there is no apparent solution.

[The Aggressive Aspect:]

Nothing in common

The full-feature electronic telephones called D-Terms now in use on the
University system are not compatible with Northwestern Bell or any other
telephone system.  Serious mishap, including explosion and fire, can occur
if these telephones are connected to the wrong system.

Last week the local utility company was training the Customer Support Reps
(CSR) on the new procedures for emergency outages, such as during a storm.
There were several people from different areas in the company, all at the
main site.  One of the screens on the computer terminal used for handling
the emergency problems calls for the name of a printer to print the report.
One of the people involved could only remember the name of the printer in
the main operations for the company.  Needless to say, there were several
hurried phones calls after a utility company crew and police arrived at the
"scene of the downed power lines" to find no problem existing.  Fortunately,
the name of the CSR is on report, so they were able to track down the person
that way, and find out the false alarm.  A little while later the operations
room called back and asked if they had sent out a gas crew an hour before.

Remailed-to-RISKS by: ckk+@andrew.cmu.edu (Chris Koenigsberg)

We experienced serious file system losses on many of the VAX UNIX systems
this weekend beginning early in the morning on Saturday 6/20.  At that time,
a new system file which controls the disk purge operation was distributed
and failed on all of the VAX systems which received it.  On all but three
machines this operation was aborted after removing a substantial number of
its system files but before any private files were affected. These machines
were returned to service upon restoration of their system files during the
weekend.  The following machines:

    SPEECH2.CS.CMU.EDU	SAM.CS.CMU.EDU		 ME.RI.CMU.EDU

each also lost a large part of one of their private file partitions.  These
file partitions are in the process of being restored from tape backups and
the machines should be back in at least limited service by 1400 Monday, 6/22.

Normally, the particular disk purge operation in question would have
recursively removed all files in /usr/preserve that were more than a week
old.  However, on Saturday morning the mode of failure resulted in the
attempted recursive removal beginning at / of all files which were more than
a week old on each affected system.

Machines with (to our knowledge) only system files removed were:

    PH1.SPEECH.CS.CMU.EDU FAS.RI.CMU.EDU	GNOME.CS.CMU.EDU
    G.CS.CMU.EDU	  THEORY.CS.CMU.EDU	UNH.CS.CMU.EDU
    ROVER.RI.CMU.EDU	  ISL1.RI.CMU.EDU	IUS1.CS.CMU.EDU
    IUS2.CS.CMU.EDU	  SPEECH1.CS.CMU.EDU	CIVE.RI.CMU.EDU

Finally, a number of the VAX workstations were also affected.  Problems
have been corrected and all system files restored on:

    LAB.AGORA		EDJ.ARCHONS	EMC.CS	  	EP.FAC
    MRT.MACH		PIE5.MACH	A.NL	  	AMADEUS.PRODIGY
    DRAKON.RESDOC	F.SPEECH	G.SPEECH	Y.SPEECH
    SPEECH3		NDIFF.VLSI	D.SPEECH

Some workstations where a problem is suspected were inaccessible and have
not yet been checked and/or corrected.  We will attempt to track down and if
necessary correct problems with these systems on Monday.  You may also
contact the Operator at x2607 to report a problem if your machine appears to
be in this category,

So far as we know, no private files on any workstation examined so far were
removed and over all only VAX mainframe and workstation systems were
affected.  At this point, while we know what went wrong and where, we still
do not completely know why.

We do apologize for any inconvenience this failure has caused.

&gt;From: Peter G. Neumann &lt;Neumann@csl.sri.com&gt;
&gt;A few of you have received a UUCP message through "cbosgd" that intended to
&gt;demonstrate that systems are not really very secure and that it is easy to 
&gt;bypass moderation on supposedly moderated news groups...  However, the message
&gt;was sent not through RISKS@CSL but through one of our innumerable 
&gt;redistribution points (and thus was received by only a very small fraction of 
&gt;all RISKS readers).

Wrong.

The parochialism of our Arpanet brethren never ceases to amaze me.  The vast
majority of RISKS readers are on Usenet.  Usenet is far larger than the
Internet, Bitnet, etc, and almost every Usenet site that receives RISKS (alias
comp.risks).  UUCP is just a transport mechanism (Usenet != UUCP-net); many
ARPA Internet sites now receive their mailing lists Usenet-style using the
nntp system.  The forged article in question travelled to every Usenet site
(including those Internet sites that use nntp).  Usenet does not use mail,
but rather a flooding mechanism; every site sends it to all their downstream
links until everyone has the article.  If many people didn't see it, that's
because several people issued "cancel" messages to make it disappear.
(These messages were forged also).  -- - Joe Buck jbuck@epimass.EPI.COM

    [Thanks for the comments.  I maintain a large list of direct addresses to 
    redistribution centers (and a few individuals) on ARPANET, MILNET, CSNET, 
    BITNET, etcNET -- with many indirections -- and those readers simply did
    not get the message in question.  They did not miss anything.
    
    By the way, "forged" is not quite right.  On the basis of the dialogue,
    I conclude that the message was REALLY-FROM "apc".  It was just a public
    misuse of a useful but totally unsound facility -- subject to loss of
    privacy at each forwarding, loss of data integrity on any message, and 
    complete denial of service if a message is cancelled along the way.  (Use 
    of the RISKS banner and standard DIGEST format would have constituted
    forgery.  It is interesting to contrast this with Piet Beertema's 
    "Chernenko@MOSKVAX" -- Software Engineering Notes, vol 9, no 4, July
    1984.)  PGN]

  ... In its alter-ego, RISKS appears on the wild-and-wooly Usenet as the
  newsgroup comp.risks.  Netnews has lots of advantages over mailing lists but
  security isn't one of them.

  ... suffice it to say that ["apc" 's abuse of RISKS] was stupid and childish,
  and the tail-end of some totally absurd argument that has been going on for
  weeks all around the net.  Roy Smith, {allegra,cmcl2,philabs}!phri!roy ]
     [Note: There are advantages of unmoderated newsgroups and advantages
     of moderated newsgroups.  I try to maintain a relatively open policy
     (subject to the masthead guidelines); at least the "official" version  
     of RISKS will remain moderated.  PGN]

Boston (AP) - "A computer problem that blanked the radar screens of air
traffic controllers from New England to the Great Lakes for six minutes
delayed flights at Logan International Airport, but posed no hazard, an
official said.  When the outage occurred Saturday afternoon, planes
immediately were ordered to fly more slowly and at greater distances from
each other, according to Mike Ciccarelli, a spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration.  He said some flights were rerouted and planes
scheduled to fly into New England were ordered to remain on the ground.
'There were delays of incoming flights, naturally, because if they wanted
to leave Newark, for example, they couldn't,' Ciccarelli said.  He said
Logan has a separate monitoring system which kept the controllers in radar
contract(sic) with flying aircraft."

   [The SF Chron reported this on 21 Jun 87.  After quoting Ciccarelli that
   there was no hazard for air travelers, it went on to say, ``... although a 
   controller who asked not to be identified described the situation as
   "very dangerous".''  Increasingly the air traffic control operations are
   coming under scrutiny.  Oprah Winfrey had a fine show the other day.  PGN]

The following article was in comp.misc on Usenet.  It was posted as a
followup to the "exploding computers" articles [RISKS-5.6], but it is really
a separate topic and an interesting hazard. [Forwarded to Risks by Mark Brader]

  In the late '70's, I worked at the Library of Congress.  We had
  IBM and Amdahl mainframes with STC tape drives as our main data base
  machines.  Given the role of the world's largest library, our computer
  room received considerable attention.
  
  The British Broadcasting Corporation was given access to much of 
  the Library, to film a documentary.  We found that some major system
  crashes began to happen when they were in the computer room.  We 
  thought it might be their video equipment, floods, etc., but could
  not find the cause.
  
  The symptom was clear:  periodically, ALL of our tape drives would
  simultaneously stop, rewind, and unload, no matter what they were
  doing.  The operating system could not deal with such simultaneous
  events, and would crash.
  
  It turned out to be an intermittent event:  most BBC work was film
  or video, but they occasionally took still photographs.  When their
  electronic flash pointed at the front of the tape drives, the short
  burst of light was reflected into the photoelectric end-of-tape
  sensors of each tape drive, causing EVERYTHING to simultaneously
  sense (erroneously) end-of-tape.

Keywords: Electronic steering, fly-by-wire
Organization: Eikonix Corp., Bedford, MA

Several months ago I posted an article to comp.risks (RISKS 4.46) about the
electronic steering in the Pontiac Pursuit project car.  All four wheels on
the car can be steered, and the force required to turn the wheels comes from
DC powered motors that are computer controlled.  There is no direct physical
connection from the steering wheel to any of the wheels.  This article
triggered a small debate in RISKS over the use of electronics in automobiles.

The June 22, 1987 issue of AUTOWEEK contains a follow up story on the Pursuit.
They took a test drive of the car, fortunately at a closed race track rather
than on the highway.  During the test drive, the car ran out of gas.  When
the engine stopped, so did the 24-volt alternators which supply power to
the steering system. The steering failed, and the car ran off the track!  
Apparently there was no battery backup for the 24-volt system.

NASA NEWS
NASA ESTABLISHES SAFETY REPORTING SYSTEM
	NASA has established a voluntary, confidential safety reporting
system for its 100,000 employees and contractor personnel to alert NASA
management of safety concerns.
	The new reporting system supplements existing safety reporting
procedures and, initially, will focus on safety concerns associated with
NASA's Space Transportation System, more familiarly known as the Space
Shuttle program. The new system is being established as a result of the
Shuttle Challenger accident.
	The NASA Safety Reporting System (NSRS) will encourage employees
to supplement existing safety reporting procedures by completing and 
submitting an NSRS confidential report form to Battelle Memorial Institute's
Columbus Division, Columbus, Ohio. Battelle Institute is under contract
to NASA to develop and administer the NSRS for NASA Headquarters'
Safety Division. 
	Use of the NSRS report form will provide anonymity to the maximum
extent possible within the law for individuals disclosing their safety
concerns. The form will contain a section at the top for individuals to
include their names, addresses and telephone numbers.
	Upon receipt of the report form, the Battelle NSRS team will
remove this top section unless team members determine that additional
data would be useful. If so, the team will contact the sender for the
needed information and then remove, stamp and return the top section
to the sender as proof that the sender has successfully filed a NSRS
report. No record will be maintained of reporting individual's identities.
	Battelle NSRS and NASA specialists then will determine whether
the reported concern is of a critical nature requiring immediate action.
	The Battelle NSRS team will summarize all reported concerns, 
store the deidentified data in a computerized data management system
and forward summaries to the NASA Headquarters Safety Division for
further analyses in cooperation with a technical advisory group.
	The Safety Division and technical advisory group also will
determine what corrective action should be taken and track the 
resolution of these recommendations.

A comment on anonymous reporting systems: the AEC (then ERDA, then NRC
and the DOE) have had such a reporting system for years.  Every nuclear
facility in the country has a special phone with a direct line to
Washington DC, but it is rarely used and is poorly maintained.  Many
"employee suggestion" programs have not worked for various fears.
Some have supposedily worked in Japan.  I have noted no such systems
on computers since E-mail always has had return addresses.  What can
we do to get people to use such systems?

Recently Rice University was the victim of a little Internet EGP madness.  I
will try to give a coherent summary, though we still don't know how it came
about.

Sometime in the evening of June 23, Libra.Rice.EDU, Rice's ARPANET gateway,
started receiving packets destined for "css-ether" (Center for Seismic
Studies Ethernet, including the machine "seismo.css.gov") and "univ-ariz"
(University of Arizona Ethernet).  Libra.Rice.EDU (10.4.0.62, 128.42.1.64)
is an LSI-11 running Dave Mills's "Fuzzball" software.  Because of the
address space limitations of the PDP-11 architecture, Libra occasionally
runs out of room in its routing table.  We suspected that such an event
might have confused Libra's EGP to the point where it sent out bogus routing
updates.

A quick check showed that Libra still knew the correct routes to css-ether
and univ-ariz.  Still, we were worried because the tables were in fact full,
so we took the gateway down for about an hour around Midnight and restarted
it with expanded tables.  We then did our best to determine that we were not
advertising ourselves as a gateway to either network.

After midnight, we continued to receive packets destined for seismo, with
sustained traffic about 4 times higher than normal.  We called BBN the
following morning (June 24), and learned that bbnnet2-arpanet-gw, one of the
three "public" EGP-speaking core gateways, continued to list us as the
gateway, with metric 2, for css-ether and univ-ariz.  The other two core
gateways had the correct routes, and BBN confirmed that Libra was
advertising only legitimate routes. The erroneous traffic fell off markedly
when bbnnet2-arpanet-gw was rebooted that afternoon, but occasional
misdirected packets persisted until late this morning (June 25).

The same evening that Libra's gateway tables filled up, BBN had loaded "new
test software" into that gateway machine, so there is no clear smoking gun
here.

This story has a "happy ending", because our Fuzzball stayed up the
whole time and dutifully forwarded packets and sent ICMP squawks to the
offending machines.

Now, the bad part.  At least 78 hosts were fooled (that is, 78 hosts
were fooled in some given hour, because the log file wrapped around
about once per hour), including machines from nets 8, 10, 18, 26,
128.{8,32,41,45,59,83,84,95,102,103,104,105,115,121}, 192.1.2,
192.5.{25,58} and 192.12.{31,33,119,206,221}.  We don't know the cause
of this problem, but it does seem like a bit of a security hole.  We
could easily have wiretapped all the traffic for seismo.css.gov, or
even substituted our own more "interesting" packets.  Thus we were
particularly amused to find traffic from Milnet hosts (11 of them)
passing through us.

Interesting. During the time you report loyal fuzzball linkabit-gw was
having exactly the same problem, mounds and mounds of traffic sloshing
in and getting dutifully redirected. However, another fuzzball dcn-gw
was having no such prolem. All squawk the same EGP code as yours and
linkabit-gw at least has the same table-space problem as yours.

There is a clue in the clock-synchronization system that you may have
noticed. I began seeing frequent clock resets, with measured roundtrip
times one hop away as the ARPANET flies reaching twenty seconds or
more (!?). When I checked the INOC for core gateway routes, I found
the directly-connected macomnet client of linkabit-gw as reachable
via purdue-gw! Something was badly wrong in the core system.

Prompted by a note from Joe Weening at SU, I found a wee bug in the fuzzball
EGP code that would, under bizarre conditions I hastily add, result in a
nonsense address in a redirect message sent by the fuzz. The bog is now
fixed in linkabit-gw and dcn-gw. I can't see how the bog would affect the
slosh you an I saw over the last few days anyway, but it might under unlikely
conditions result in a j-random host, having mistakenly been redirected to
your gateway, not being redirected back to the proper gateway.

I forgot to add that table overflow will not affect what you send the
core, only what you can reach. If the table does overflow, the net(s)
lost will appear unreachable. I'm working on that. Also, I saw evidence
that the core tables were being corrupted with martians (net 112?!)
that reached back to touch us in the swamps. I also saw broadcasts
(sic) coming from a 128.205 hosts landing at linkabit-gw, truly a
martian who lost his compass.

  Subject: ATTENTION ALL MICRO USERS!!! FCC INFORMATION TAX AHEAD!!
  Date: 12 Jun 87 15:13:37 GMT
  
  	A terrible piece of news I just read about in the New York Times
  this morning.  The FCC just voted 4-0 to impose a $4.50 - $5.50 an HOUR
  tax on people who are using the phone system to transmit information
  across state lines.  This INCLUDES anyone hooking up to a network,
  not just people dialing out of state!!  I suppose people dialing
  into a system with access to Arpanet or even USENET might be charged
  this tax; the information services (Compuserve, etc.) are slated
  to be charged this tax as of January 1.  This is an outrageous tax
  which would squelch the burgeoning telecommunications industry,
  and is totally unjustified.  I would urge people to write letters
  to their Congressman to protest this unfair and exorbitant "information
  tax" which is based on superstition and lack of understanding of
  the telecommunications industry.

... is a piece of software that actually makes a computer blow up just
like in the movies.  This is long overdue.  "Lay" people are extremely
disappointed when a program or system grinds/wheezes to a halt with some wimpy
message like "B037X: USER ERROR IN GAPX TABLE" or "CATASTROPHIC SYSTEM FAILURE:
BUFFER OVERFLOW INDICATOR OVERFLOW" or "Bus error - core dumped".  They want
to see explosions!  Paper spewing out from wherever paper spews out from!
And gicky fluid oozing out of the machinery as the entire machine room
collapses onto itself because someone either forgot to put a %*&amp;#*$#&amp;@ in
column 92 or asked the computer an impossible question like "What's the
meaning of life?", "Why?", "CAN you get there from here?", "Calculate pi to
the last digit" [THAT'S NOT A QUESTION!], or "Where's the bathroom?"  That's
a worthy goal for computer technologists everywhere.  Forget artificial
intelligence!  Forget relational databases!  Forget distributed network
architecture proposal interface protocols!  Forget documentation!  Forget
associative memory!  Let's make computers explode in our lifetime!!!

A small step was taken toward this end back in the early sixties, in IBM's
System/360 model 30 CE school.  Seems one of the better students had time
enough to pore over the schematics and discover which cores (remember core
memory?) were located just beneath the overtemp sensor.  He wrote a small
program that did nothing but abuse those particular cores by writing ones
and zeroes alternately to them, until they heated up, and the temperature
sensor shut down the machine.

First, of course, the program printed out "Programmed Power Down" on the
console.  Caused a lot of bewilderment among the students and instructors.
Especially since the big feature being touted about the S/360 was that it
was so oriented to multiprogramming that it didn't even have a HALT
instruction.

 stuck.  These articles were then nicely topped by this one:  --msb]

Some years ago I worked on a battery-powered instrument (it would run 24 to
48 hours on batteries) in which the project manager insisted that the OFF
switch should be an interrupt to the CPU, which would then power itself
down.

You guessed it.. the uP derailed and the only ways to get it back were:
1. Open the instrument up and yank the battery leads, or
2. Pull it off the charger and wait a day or two.

Fortunately (:-) it never made it to market.

Um.... many computers built for military applications contain a "trap door"
that can be reached by an assembly sequence that will direct the transformer
or power supply *input* onto the motherboard.  Manufacturers of this type of
computer include HP and Litton.  This "feature" is supposed to be used to
destroy your computer as the installation is being overrun by the enemy.
Since most of these suckers use large DC generators as input to the
transformers/power supplies, you can imagine the fireworks that occur when
this stuff reaches all those cute little ICs. ;-)

It was supposed to leave the attackers with molten sludge.

The following story was related to me by employees of
I.P. Sharp Associates (IPS).  They, with Scientific Time 
Sharing Corp. (STSC) wrote APL for IBM back in the early days.

It seems that there started to be competitors to IPS/STSC's APL system.
These companies would usually use IBMs APL (written by IPS/STSC)
on their large IBM mainframes.  Sometimes they would add extra
bulletproofing so that APL would not bomb, get better performance, etc.

Now, IPS/STSC really knew APL (and the IBM implementation) very well.
In fact, an employee living in Palo Alto would debug/enhance the
production on-line APL system from his home!

There were people across North America and in Europe (at that time) using
this single mainframe (360/158 I think).  The computer was in Toronto Canada.

Anyway, a competitor named Manhattan APL (I think) called up IPS and said
they were about to come online and if IPS wanted to, they could test
the system.  Manhattan said they had filled in all the holes and the system
was unbreakable.

Manhattan APL came online for their customers about 2 months late.
It seems that some of their disk drives had thrashed themselves to death.

I inadvertently wrote a BASIC program on an HP2000 at George Mason University
that blew up the disk drive.  It was an 8 player real time space war game.
The problem was that all interprocess communication had to take place via
disk.  I used the documented LOCK function for serialization.  It seems that
this function loaded a special OS overlay whenever invoked and reloaded 
the file I/O overlay directly afterward.  With 8 programs doing this
as fast as possible, the disk would die.

The problem was solved by using an undocumented feature of the scheduler.
A process was always assigned 1 sec of CPU following completion of a wait
for terminal I/O.  This allowed serialization with careful coding while
not using the LOCK overlay.

BTW, an IBM PC program can blow up the monitor and video cards by programming
nasty parameters into the video controller chip.

The CompuColor 2 personal computer of about the 1978-80 era could be made
to fry itself from BASIC. A simple FOR loop outputting 1-255 into a certain
I/O address (it's Z-80 based) caused the screen to blank in an entertaining
fashion, followed by the smell of smoke. You had to pull the plug at the
wall to get it to stop. I was totally amazed. Just think of the possibilities.
I don't know exactly what was going on, but I suspect that they had too much
trust in software and used the CPU to control such things as the power supply
so they could save $5 worth of chips.

When I was in high school, we had several SWTPC 6800 machines, of
slightly post-Altair vintage.  They had 32k of RAM (a lot at the time),
5-1/4" single density drives that held around 90k, a CP/M-like operating
system, and you had to boot them by calling the disk boot rom from the
monitor.

Anyway, I saw demonstrated (not with the school's permission, as you can
probably guess) a program called "DEATH" which did a number of destructive
things including stepping the drives out of range and apparently using this
opcode you mention.  I remember the main board going in for service after
that and coming back with lots of new chips.  I never knew how a program
could do this until now...

(Don't take everything I said as absolute truth... my memory is a bit
fuzzy... I do distinctly remember the computer being fried by that program,
though.  And no, I was not the one who did that... I was only a spectator)

On another note, some of the earlier Commodore PET's had a register in
their video controller that set the number of scan lines (or something like
that).  On some of them, you could tweak this register to get a better looking
screen display.  On others, doing so would toast the video circuitry.  While
this is not strictly in the "exploding computer" category, in the PETs the
monitor WAS in the same case, so it has the same effect on the poor guy who
watches it happen :-)

A few years back, PC magazine and PC World published claims that it was 
possible to program the video controller chip in the CGA
(Computer Graphice Adapter) video adapter board
so that an ordinary color monitor's flyback transformer would overheat
and catch fire. Has anybody done this? Is it included in anyone's copy
detection? Anyone's error handler?

It should be real simple to do. That chip gives you pretty good control
over the video waveform, so you ought to be able to play with the timing
of the horizontal sync pulse, (which, as I remember, was the way the trick
was done.) has anybody extened these techniques to the more sophisticated
EGA (Extended Graphics), and PGA (Professional Graphics).

In the 1880's the Canadian Pacific Railway wanted a line between Montreal
and Toronto but could neither afford to build one nor to buy out an existing
railway.  So what they did was to take a perpetual lease on an existing
railway, the Ontario and Quebec.  Later they did buy up O&amp;Q stock until
they held 80% of it.

Along with the O&amp;Q came land in Toronto and Montreal that is now of great
value.  Over the years the CPR sold off this land.  Finally someone noticed
that they didn't really own it, bought up some O&amp;Q shares, and brought suit
against the CPR.  The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.
Just before the court decision the O&amp;Q shares were valued at $15,000 (Can.)
each.  A ruling for the O&amp;Q would likely raise that by a factor of 10 or more
-- and a ruling for the CPR would drop it by a factor of 10 or more!

The court ruled for the CPR, and the stock dropped $14,100 per share in
one day (and more the next day).  But there was no entry in the stock
market columns for this remarkable change (the stock was listed as not
traded).  According to the Toronto Star, "a Toronto Stock Exchange computer
interpreted the sharp drop reported by stockbrokers as an error".

From the June 30 Edition of the San Diego Union:

                  PacBell's Service is Disrupted: 
       Computer glitch snarls multitude of 619 area calls

     A computer program glitch disrupted telephone service in San Diego and
Imperial Counties for several hours yesterday, potentially affecting all 1.1
million Pacific Bell customers in the two-county area.  The breakdown came
on the busiest workday of the year's busiest telephone season.  A major
malfunction in the computerized switching equipment at the company's main
station in Hillcrest prevented many long-distance calls from going through
the 619 area code, Pacific Bell spokesmen said.  Affected were both local
and long-distance toll calls.

     Pacific bell noticed calls backing up on its monitor at around 9:30 AM.
By late afternoon, technicians had traced the problem to a mysterious
foul-up in the programs -- the only part of the enormous computer, installed
in 1984 and working since without a hitch, that has been updated frequently,
a company spokesman said.  The system was shut down at 10:56 AM for 152
seconds -- a record.  Then the computer had to be reloaded, trunk line by
trunk line, while the search continued for the problem.  By 6 PM, most of
the system was back in service.

(The story goes on to describe the local impact, especially on the
long-distance companies who weren't at fault.)

  &gt;NASA has established a voluntary, confidential safety reporting system ...

For many years, NASA has operated the Aviation Safety Reporting System
(ASRS) for the FAA.  It has been quite successful, producing important
information about flight safety.

The ASRS has two key features to encourage participation: immunity and
confidentiality.  When someone reports an incident to the ASRS, he/she
gains immunity from FAA disciplinary action for inadvertent errors
associated with it (deliberate actions are not protected).  NASA ensures
confidentiality by separating the identifying information from the report
during initial processing.  The reporter receives a numbered receipt which
can be used to prove that he/she reported the incident to ASRS.  Without
the receipt, the reporter cannot be identified.

The ASRS works because it offers an inducement for reporting (immunity),
and provides reliable confidentiality.  It probably helps that the program
is operated by a trusted, independent agency.

The notion that the proposed access charges for enhanced service providers
represents some kind of "information tax" seems to be remarkably popular.
Of course, it's total nonsense.  The FCC is merely suggesting that Tymnet,
Telenet, etc. no longer be exempt from the access charges that all other
services (e.g., long distance voice) must pay for connection to the local
telephone network.

The original exemption was to protect a "fledgling industry."  Whether the
industry can now compete on an equal basis with AT&amp;T and MCI remains to be
seen.

The computer-related risk here seems to be in how easy it is to forget that
our networks are being heavily subsidized by both private and public money.

RISKS-5.5 reprinted part of a newspaper story:

  Boston (AP) - "A computer problem that blanked the radar screens of air
  traffic controllers from New England to the Great Lakes for six minutes
  delayed flights at Logan International Airport, but posed no hazard, an
  official said....

This is at best vague and pointlessly inflammatory; at worst it's nonsense.

The key question is: was more than one installation affected?  What exactly
does "from New England to the Great Lakes" mean?  If they mean more than one
site, how could that have happened?  Are ATC computers networked together in
such a way that a crash can propagate? (I doubt it; as I understand it they're
too old to know about things like networks).  If not networks, then perhaps it
was a common mode power failure.  At sites several hundred miles apart?  I
doubt it.  If more than one site, then why were only the Logan flights
delayed?  How exactly could more than one site be affected at the same time
and for the same duration?  And in what conceivable sense was it "a computer
problem"?  A common mode software bug?  One that bit all the places at the
same instant?

It's considerably more likely that what they really meant was something like
"One computer failed today for six minutes at Logan airport."  Presumably the
longer-range radar at Logan tracks some flights as far as Lake Ontario (about
500 mi).  It's also possible that there are ATC centers in Montreal, Toronto,
Buffalo, Detroit, New York, Cleveland, Columbus, etc. etc., (all within the
same 500 mi. range) that were capable of tracking those flights, in addition
to the backup system mentioned in the story.  It's also interesting that
there's still sufficient flexibility in the ATC system that simply slowing
things down handled the problem.

The problem is that "One air traffic control system halted for six minutes
today at Logan airport" and "it didn't matter at all," just isn't much of a
story.  Not nearly anxiety producing enough; not nearly technophobic.

Imagine the same story written with a slightly different viewpoint: "The
reliability of our rather old ATC system was demonstrated today when the
system at Logan airport failed completely for six minutes.  Even though flites
as far as 500 miles away were affected, the problem was easily handled by the
existing procedures for slowing down some flights and keeping others on the
ground, made possible by the routine use of backup communication systems
designed for this purpose."

There are as I understand it abundant problems in getting ATC done right,
ranging from reliable sw and hw to reliable organizations of people and
alignment of responsibilities.  It's best we attend to the real problems and
try to discourage nonsense like this.  Tell your local newspaper they really
do have to get the facts correct.

The airmiss was allegedly due to the display equipment not showing details
of an aircraft because it had a duplicate SSR transponder code...

But aircraft without an assigned code all have the same code (1234 in
UK, 1200(?) in US); similarly emergency traffic all uses a small
number of not-guaranteed-unique codes; so this can't be the entire
explanation... (one hopes!)

               PHONE COMPANY GIVES SOMETHING FOR NOTHING

Dear Ann,

I think I can top the person who wrote complaining about the idiocy of the
phone company.  Talk about garbage in, garbage out!

When AT&amp;T split with Bell, we had three phones in our house.  The equipment
belonged to Ma Bell and the service belonged to AT&amp;T.  After we returned all
the phone equipment to Ma Bell, we received a bill for $0.00.  A few weeks
later, we received a check for $5 and a note thanking us.  Several months
later, we received another computerized bill for $0.00.  We called again,
got nowhere, so we sent another check for $0.00.  A few weeks later we
received another $5 refund with the same thank you.

This went on every three months for two years.  Now we are down to once a
year and have given up trying to straighten this out.  We just cash the $5
and forget about it.

Here's something to chew on.

%T DOD Gives Software Developers More Leeway In Writing Code
%J Electronics
%V 60
%N 12
%P 99
%D June 11, 1987
%O Military/Aerospace Newsletter (department)
%K SDS 2167/A Top-Down Methodology Waiver
%X Military contractors no longer will be forced to use top-down methodology --
in which design and coding of computer programs use a hierarchical structure --
when developing software for the Department of Defense.  The Pentagon has
revised its two-year-old Defense System Software Development Standard,
designated 2167, and will issue the new version, 2167/A, on June 30.  The
document spells out what the DOD expects from software contractors and gives
them more leeway in writing code than the original standard.  Although the
DOD revised 2167 in response to industry dissatisfaction with the standard,
some software suppliers are calling for further changes, such as provisions
for rapid prototyping.  Howard L. Yudkin, president of the Software
Productivity Consortium, a Reston, Va., group respresenting 14 aerospace
companies, is pushing for an industry position on where and how to use and
not use 2167.  The DOD, he says, should "recognize Standard 2167 as good for
the engineering development phase for which it was intended, but not for
advanced development."  The Pentagon's Computer Software Management Subgroup,
the joint-services committee responsible for 2167 revisions and compliance,
believes that 2167 coverage of rapid prototyping is premature, according to
Air Force Capt. Rick Schmidt, committee chairman.
%X That is the entirety of the announcement.  Having not seen the revised
standard (and not being a follower of the original, for that matter), I can't
ascertain whether this is a dangerous situation or not.  But it reminds me
that the reputation of the Go To is being restored in the letters sections
of Communications of the ACM, also.

I don't know how much this subject has been hashed/re-hashed in RISKS,
but a paragraph from an article in _Mustang Monthly_ caught my eye.  The
gist of the article is on boosting the horsepower of the new Mustangs.

&gt;  From: "Free Horsepower for HOs!" (Mustang Monthly, July 1987)
&gt;
&gt;      To get a more immediate horsepower boost from the elimination
&gt;      of the intake silence, disconnect the negative post on the 
&gt;      battery for at least 45 seconds to erase the computer's memory.
&gt;      That way, when you crank the engine again, the computer will
&gt;      immediately begin monitoring the fuel mixture to compensate for
&gt;      the extra air flowing into the fuel injection.  Be sure to 
&gt;      disconnect the negative post;  if you disconnect the positive
&gt;      post, the reconnection could cause a power surge that could 
&gt;      possibly damage the computer.

The Mustang freaks here where I work (including myself) were interested in
these tips, but as computer people, we were more intrigued by the last bit
about damaging the computer and erasing the memory.  A couple of questions:

   1) If disconnecting the negative post will erase the computer's memory,
      what happens when your battery dies?  Or _you_ yourself take the 
      battery off for some reason?  Does that also erase it, or does taking
      the positive post off within 45 seconds somehow keep you from losing 
      the memory?

   2) From that, what exactly do you lose when the memory is erased?

   3) Is this mentioned by Ford manuals or any shop manuals (i.e. Chilton's)?
      I know dealers don't mention this - my family just bought a Sable, and
      I would presume that the computers are basically the same, and our 
      salesman never mentioned it.

   4) What does this do with emissions control?  Some counties in Maryland
      have regular testing - would you still pass with the fuel being mixed
      differently?

Whatever information anyone could provide would be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks.                                           Shaun

On the 4th of July in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a prisoner kidnapped one guard,
shot another, commandeered the control center, and released six other
prisoners.  All 7 went through an emergency roof door, pole-vaulted over a
barbed-wire prison fence, and disappeared.  The guard tower was being
staffed only during daylight hours ``because of financial restrictions'' (SF
Chronicle, 6 Jul 1987).  A PBS item noted that the prison computer control
system was down at the time, and otherwise would have prevented the escape!

     I read recently of some problems that Intel had with the 32-bit
multiply instruction on their 80386 processors.  I am surprised that this
sort of problem does not occur more often: an obscure hardware bug which
sometimes gives incorrect answers.  All the emphasis is on software bugs.
The assumption is that hardware will work or fail catastrophically, or that
error correcting circuits will detect problems.  Is this always so?
     How often do microprocessors fail in minor ways?  People have written
about proving correctness of code: it is not possible to prove the
correctness of hardware.  For example, a complete test of a 32 bit
multiplier would require 2**64, or 1.8E19 operations.  (A year has only
3E13 microseconds.)  Even without complete tests, writing diagnostic
programs was extremely difficult when various margin and worst case
conditions had to be considered.  For example, memory diagnostic programs
moved themselves around in memory; they would write bit patterns of 1's,
0's, alternating 10's and 01's, actual addresses into locations, and so on.
     Hardware problems can also be bizarre.  My favorite was during an
experiment at sea.  We were recording data, and occasionally the magnetic
tape unit would hang.  Putting cards on extender boards to check signals
showed us that sometimes the tape was erroneously showing up busy, and
sometimes the computer couldn't even find the tape.  Some hours later, we
found a small (1-2 mm) piece of loose wire in the back plane.  As the ship
rolled, the wire would sometimes short out the busy line, and sometimes
short out a line which changed the physical address of the drive.  We had
another problem (this on land) where the card side of a backplane had been
painted; tiny paint chips fell off and short/open circuited various cards.
We only found it when someone took out all the cards and noticed the paint.
Can't happen again?  I read recently that a radar in a US fighter plane was
having intermittent problems.  The problem was tin whiskers which grew
inside an IC, were shaken loose by vibrations and sometimes caused internal
shorts.  Everything repeats, only different.

I'm told that a hearing is now underway which would set a legal precedent
for determining the extent of liability to be borne by software developers
for the performance of expert systems authored by them. Does anyone have
details on this?

The last time I moved, I have noticed that certains organizations were
becoming slower in accepting change of address notices. I have been
receiving mail to my old address even after some mail (all computer printed)
had already been sent to my new address. Some organizations had to be
notified several times in writing, by phone and in person.

The latter revealed a possible explanation to this phenomenon:  Many
departments acquired PC's lately and kept their own personal 'phone books';
in effect they have created a distributed database, without the discipline
and procedures needed to manage it.  Changes to the organization's central
DB did not propagate well, if at all, to these small personal DB's.

It seems that nowadays when dealing with a big organization, one has to
notify them of any change in writing, so that the central DB would be
updated; then by phone or in person, directly to the department one is
dealing with, so that the change would *really* be done.  So far this has not
been a risk, only a nuisance. Horror stories, anyone?

Perhaps it isn't correct to call it a tax - though it has never been
made clear just who is to get the money.  But it is hardly "nonsense"
to criticize it.  The same bandwidth that supports one voice link
supports fifty 1200-baud data links.  In practice, far more, because of
packet switching - i.e., 1200-baud data is not usually sent continuously.

Charge $5 an hour for a 1200 baud link?  Only if at least $250 an hour
is charged for voice lines!

If this bill passes, it will no longer be profitable to sublet small
slices of T1 lines.  There will be no reason not use use a full 56kb
voice band line even for 300 baud data.

The only ones who will benefit from this radical decrease of efficiency
are those who will profit from installing unneeded new bandwidth, to be
used in this inefficient manner.  I say, if they can't compete in the
free market, tough.  Don't let them trash our freedom to communicate.

If this passes, it will keep me off the net, since my networking cost
would go from $25 a month to over $2000 a month.  I don't believe
that anyone is subsidizing this.  As far as the local phone company is
concerned, it's just another local call, and it is absurd to suggest
it costs them any more than any other local call.  As long as competing
local phone companies are not allowed, it is outrageous to allow the
one local phone company to take one's data hostage, demanding thousands
of dollars for what costs them pennies, for no better reason than that
they can get away with it.

I would also question how the FCC can make laws.  That is the perogative
of Congress, and I see nothing in the Constitution allowing them to
delegate their power to unelected bureaucrats.

There is a computer game about "Geopolitics in the nuclear age" called
BALANCE OF POWER.  It is sold at least for Commodore Amiga.  I bought one and
now master the beginners level -- being able to beat Soviet Union.  (We Finns 
have tried that twice before...)  I do not have time and interest to do that
on the expert level, as I find many other things more interesting to do.

What does interest me is how people in the USA percieve the world view of
this game.  Do you think it is reasonable?  There may be some risk in
designing games simulating international affairs, if they are seemingly
realistic.  Some childish people may take them as the truth.

   [Although this is only marginally relevant, it raises related

&gt; For many years, NASA has operated the Aviation Safety Reporting System
&gt; (ASRS) for the FAA.  It has been quite successful, producing important
&gt; information about flight safety.
&gt;...
&gt; The ASRS works because it offers an inducement for reporting (immunity),

I think that the past tense should be used here.  I'm just going from memory,
but I recall that in the late '70s the immunity provisions were dropped and
ASRS quickly faded into oblivion.  If it is still in operation, few pilots
(including me) are aware of it.

The following appeared in the Wednesday (24-Jun) New York Times, in the
Metropolitan Diary, a weekly column of "human interest" stories sent in
by readers:

	A small sign was taped to a building on West 120th Street near
	Amsterdam Avenue, and Ellen Shaw of Scotch Plains, N.J., noticed
	it as she passed by.  It was a discreet advertiesement for a
	nearby stand run by three young entrepreneurs - two boys and a
	girl - who were selling iced tea, cola and cookies.

	Ms. Shaw ordered tea and offered the youngsters a suggestion:
	"You may want to make a bigger sign," she said.  "That one is
	really not to noticeable."

	"I know," said one of the boys, gesturing toward one of his
	partners, "but that's as big as his computer makes them."

	He paused, thought for a moment, and slapped his forehead.  "Hey,
	I've got it!" he exclaimed.  "Maybe we could DRAW a bigger sign!"	

	The tea, incidentally, was herbal.

         ``Big Red'' seems to be a Trojan horse, not a virus, but then
         the article contains a few other technical curiosities as well.  PGN]

&gt;   Date: Tue 2 Jun 87 11:16:51-PDT
&gt;   From: DParker@Stripe.SRI.Com &lt;Donn Parker&gt;
&gt;   Subject: Australian Computer Crime                   [From <A HREF="/Risks/4.94.html">RISKS-4.94</A>]
&gt; 
&gt;   A sophisticated computer crime occurred in Australia recently...  A 
&gt;   disgruntled employee modified PC circuit boards.  One called "Icepick" 
&gt;   attacked ACF-2 on an IBM mainframe.  The other called "Big Red" was 
&gt;   used in a virus attack.

From "The Australian", Tues, 14th April 1987, page 41.

LOCAL CRIME TEAM CRACKS THE RIDDLE OF BIG RED
=============================================

The lethal computer virus known as Big Red has been tracked down and beaten
by a team of Australian computer crime investigators, solving a riddle that
has eluded foreign experts.  The so-called virus has been held responsible
for a string of computer disasters in several countries since it was first
detected in a NASA system in the United States in 1985.  It is generated by
an advanced technology device planted in computer systems.  At least 50 Big
Red devices have been found in the US, England and Australia in banking and
information-handling systems, but have never been cracked before.

Mr Stuart Gill, head of the Australian team that cracked the virus,
described Big Red as a "solid state data diddling device capable of breaking
encryption devices and corrupting data".  Mr Gill said his team had found
Big Red in the computer system of a "medium-sized Australian company that
handles very sensitive information".  He said the device was being used to
capture and store encrypted word-processing data in the contracts division
of the NSW-based company.

It was imbedded in the thick resin that had frustrated previous attempts to
examine the inner workings of the system.  "It is the first time anywhere in
the world that somebody has been able to find one in an operating
environment and find out how it works," Mr Gill said.

The investigation exposed the actual workings of the system, including
its circuitry, how it is connected with computer systems, the interface
with security control systems and the device's power source.

It confirmed that Big Red, frequently regarded as a part of industry
mythology, operates as a parasitic operating system within a host
environment.  "A lot of rumours and a lot of folklore have built up around
Big Red," Mr Gill said.  "The device is not as sophisticated and
comprehensive as it has been rumoured to be."  

There is now no doubt that Big Red has the power to transfer encrypted data
from legitimate files into "invisible" files, which can be accessed by users
without disturbing the host's access control and encryption systems.

Mr Gill also demonstrated another suspect device, designed to function as a
stand-alone system and probably used to operate an illegal gambling machine
disguised as a computer game.

Both devices were found by an investigation team led by Mr Gill, one of
Australia's leading experts on the unauthorised use of computer systems.
His five-member investigation team took 19 hours to uncover, analyse,
anaesthetise and remove Big Red from a host computer system where it had
been planted inside a terminal.  The team, part of the Melbourne-based
Comreco Computer Security, was called in by the company involved after
management, using an audit trail, had discovered that the host system was
being used after hours.  

Half pages of encrypted wordprocessing data were "just disappearing off the
face of the Earth".  The disappearence of the pages resulted from a
malfunction in the Big Red device, which normally "echoes" the appropriated
data back into its legitimate file, leaving no sign of unauthorised
activity.  "As far as I can tell, part of the circuit was burnt out.  It was
there for about three months," Mr Gill said.

A circuit test procedure revealed a trace of circuit activity that was not
part of the normal system's operation and the team "found the activity of
Big Red as it detected that the normal system was being shut down".  "I
thought to myself, now that I have you, the question is where the hell are
you?  The system had 50 terminals," Mr Gill said.

Big Red was found in an unused terminal, where Mr Gill suspects it was
planted by someone using "the old `I'm here to service the PCs' lurk".  "My
advice to anybody is that if you have a workstation that is going to be
unused for any given length of time, pull it out," he said.

The device was identified using several criteria, including the small red
LED, which gave the system its name.  It lights up when the system is
operational.  "Its location in the communications port of the terminal, the
resin casing and the red circuit board were all pointers to Big Red.

"We found it after twelve hours and it took another 7 hours to actually
determine what it was doing," Mr Gill said.  "I wasn't sure whether to
remove Big Red from the system or bring the computer here (to Comreco's
office) and surgically remove it.  "Sparks flew when we pulled it out but
that was all."

[The article goes on to say that this shows that Australian companies are
capable of coping with high tech security, and that if American companies
are thinking of setting up shop here, they will meet stiff competition.]

I can't find information that is a more technical description of Big Red,
or whether they caught the person who installed the device.

The federal panel report blamed the air traffic control system itself for
the Aeromexico crash, although it also blamed the entry of the smaller plane
into the restricted airspace.  It criticized ``limitations'' of the control
system's policy of relying on pilots scanning the skies for other aircraft
instead of advising planes under their control about other planes that are
flying under visual flight rules.  Board members also noted an apparent
weakness in the radar signal, which may have made the small plane less
noticeable.  The safety board tried not to blame either the controller or
the pilots, but said that the controller should have seen the Piper -- it
was on his radar screen, although the controller has maintained it was not.
(AP item in SF Chron 8 July 1987)

Last night's evening news noted that Delta Airlines has had three
altercations recently -- the pilot who accidentally turned off engines and
nearly crash landed in the ocean, a pilot who landed at the wrong airport in
Kentucky, and a very near miss ("They could read each other's markings.").

You may recall that BART had an unexplained power failure on 17 May 1987,
unprecedented in its 15-year history.  17 switches opened for five hours,
and then mysteriously closed again.  On 7 July 1987 BART announced that the
cause had been ascertained -- a short circuit resulted from the use of a
battery charger in combination with a faulty switch.  (SF Chronicle, 8 July
1987).

The following is excerpted from the Peninsula Times-Tribune, Sunday,
July 5, 1987.  The byline is by Jack Brenan [sp?], Tribune Media Services
(reproduced without permission).

  FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  -- When Jim Wyatt received his monthly telephone bill
  last Tuesday morning, he got the surprise of his life -- a $14,720.96
  surprise.  The bill was 2-inches thick, 210 pages long, detailing 4,931
  long-distance calls made on his U.S.  Sprint account.  Total number of
  minutes logged: 72,849.  That's 50.6 days of non-stop talking in 30 days. ...
  
  John Frusciante, who prosecutes computer related crime for the Broward State
  Attorney's Office said Wyatt appeared to be the victim of one of the larger
  long-distance fraid cases in recent memory.  ...  U.S. Sprint spokesman
  Steve Dykes said officials had not started investigating the bill yet, but
  that Wyatt probably was victimized by a hacker who used a computer to obtain
  his secret access code and pass it around.  ...  "This is something we take
  very seriously.  We have been beefing up our security department," Dykes
  said.  "It's about a half-billion-dollar -- that's with a B -- problem a
  year for the industry."  ...  "Most of the time, a computer is utilized to
  attempt to locate valid access codes using an automatic dialer.  In essence,
  you put it on automatic pilot and let it do its thing," Frusciante said.
  
  Wyatt ...  said he made his only concern clear on the telephone [to 
  U.S. Sprint] before he hung up. "I'm not going to pay the bill," he said.
 
The article is amusing, but it raises an interesting concern.  The
response of the U.S.  Sprint people is to "beef up security." If their
system was penetrated as they believe, the problem is probably better
solved by improving the lock rather than looking for the thief.

The activity profile of an auto-dialer that is trying to find legal
access codes is VERY different from that of a legitimate customer.  It
should be easy to have the computer foil such attempts (by holding the
circuit open for 30 seconds and disconnecting after N attempts), to
confuse such attempts (by always returning a FAILED code after the Nth
attempt) or even to help apprehend the perpetrator (by flagging the
line for a trace, or even tracing it automatically if this is legal). 

Even if the penetration in this case was not so trivial, the article seems
to indicate that the people at U.S. Sprint believe such a penetration is
possible.  Perhaps there should be legal recourse for customers who are
inconvenienced by such inadequate security.

I am more familiar with the internals of the GM system, but the GM and Ford
engine control computers have enough in common that this should be true for
both:

&gt;   1) If disconnecting the negative post will erase the computer's memory,
&gt;      what happens when your battery dies?  Or _you_ yourself take the 
&gt;      battery off for some reason?  Does that also erase it, or does taking
&gt;      the positive post off within 45 seconds somehow keep you from losing 
&gt;      the memory?

  If you lose battery power, the computer's volatile memory is erased.  It
doesn't matter whether the battery dies, explodes, is disconnected, or the
computer falls off the firewall.  Disconnecting the ground (negative) post
has been the preferred way to remove power on cars since long before the
computer era; I believe this is simply because the negative post is less
cluttered.

&gt;   2) From that, what exactly do you lose when the memory is erased?

  The GM computer keeps a "crib sheet" of mixture data (indexed according
to operating conditions) so that it can get close to the correct mixture
without waiting for the oxygen sensor feedback, a memory of fault
conditions, and some state information to help it decide whether the
engine is likely to require warm-start or cold-start techniques (for
instance).  All this is lost when the computer loses power.  If you have
disconnected power, the computer will have to rebuild its crib sheet, and
GM suggests that you drive for a few miles at varying speeds and throttle
openings to give it the data it needs (the engine has to be warm, too, since
the computer needs the feedback from the oxygen sensor).

  This crib sheet is basically a set of corrections to the standard data for
your engine and car; the engine computer will work adequately without it,
but performance and driveability improves as the crib sheet data gets better.

  Incidentally, on cars with electronic dash displays, the odometer is an
electronic display of the value on a mechanical counter buried in the
dash somewhere (even on cars like the GM C-bodies which have electronic
speedometer/odometer systems, where the mechanical counter is driven by
an electronic circuit).  The GM C-bodies are "Chrysler resistant" (so to
speak), since the same signal feeds the engine control computer and the
odometer circuit; disconnecting the odometer (unless you get fairly
fancy) also disconnects the engine computer, and this causes things not to
work very well (the engine computer really likes to know how fast the
car is moving, and gets upset if you're sitting at wide-open throttle
and zero mph for hours at a time).

&gt;   3) Is this mentioned by Ford manuals or any shop manuals (i.e. Chilton's)?
&gt;      I know dealers don't mention this - my family just bought a Sable, and
&gt;      I would presume that the computers are basically the same, and our 
&gt;      salesman never mentioned it.

  The GM shop manuals explain this quite clearly.  It is possible to read
most of this information out (GM cars have a little connector under the
dash which includes a serial line to the computer), and some of it is
quite valuable for service purposes (for instance, the crib sheet will show
if the engine is running unusually lean or rich, which may indicate a leak
in the intake system).

  The GM computer is quite paranoid about its sensor data, too, and a large
chunk of the ECM code is just checking the sensor values to see if they
make sense; if the ECM decides something's strange, it records a fault
code and lights the "Service Engine Soon" indicator on the dash.  The
fault codes can be read out through the connector, and the service manuals
have flow charts for tracking down the problems indicated by the codes.

  I'd be surprised if the average car salesman knew much about the engine
control computer; even if he or she did, I doubt the average car buyer would
be interested.  I'm not surprised the salesman never mentioned it.

&gt;   4) What does this do with emissions control?  Some counties in Maryland
&gt;      have regular testing - would you still pass with the fuel being mixed
&gt;      differently?

  The volatile memory (the stuff you lose when you disconnect power) is (at
most) a set of minor corrections to the standard settings for your combination
of engine, transmission, and options.  Once the engine is warm, and you've
driven a few miles and given the computer a chance to rebuild its tables,
you will be (more or less) back to the state you were in before the power
failure.  The standard settings are all in non-volatile memory (PROMs in
most cases) which won't be affected by power loss.

Friends of mine were recently stung by an unanticipated problem in the
interaction of the hardware and software.  They were using a random
number function which was not truly random.  One way to more closely
approximate true randomness was to get a new seed from the system
clock for each call to the generator.

When the software was being debugged, this worked fine.  However, when
the debugging was turned off, the random numbers suddenly started
repeating (in a predictable and non-random way).

It turned out that when the software ran at full speed (without the
debugging code to slow it down) it sampled the clock too quickly.
Thus, the seed number was not changed and the random-number generator
would produce the same number.

This bug was quite difficult to catch because it depended on the speed
of series of calls to the clock-reading function.  This speed was not
only slightly different from execution to execution, it depended on
the system load.  And, of course, it changed as soon as you started to
monitor it.

From Digital Review April 6, 1987 p.75
 
           "Victims Sought in Wall Street Fraud"
 
     "The [S.E.C.], the U.S. Secret Service, and the Arizona attourney
general's office are all investigating a reported $28.8 million computer
fraud (and a bizarre cover-up) alleged [!] to have taken place at a New York
City brokerage house on June 20, 1986."

     To paraphrase a bit, there is a problem during the triple witching day
(hour?) when the volume of transactions skyrockets. This firm's solution to
the resulting computer overload was to "speed up the operation of it's IBM
computer system by turning off the applications-level software that recorded
information for the audit trail for each transaction."  A clever clerk set
up 22 bank accounts under fictitious names for himself and selflessly
volunteered for overtime that evening to help clear up the backlog.  He then
sold a bunch of customer's holdings and credited the money to his phony
accounts, transferred the money to a numbered Swiss account, and left for
'vacation'....
     The really scary part about this is that no-one knows for sure what
securities he sold, who they belonged to, or how much money he ended up
with! They also don't know where he is, but that's hardly surprising. :+)
They wouldn't have even known that it happened except that another clerk was
working on the same data and saw something change that wasn't supposed to.
The firm is calling it a computer error and "hopes that customer complaints
would allow it to identify and reimburse the victims."

It would be worth examining the [reporting systems] that do work, and
they're not all in Japan:  both the US and the UK have confidential
aviation-safety reporting systems which get serious use.  One factor which
may be significant is that these systems are *not* run by the people
involved in managing aviation safety! They funnel through third parties (in
the US it's NASA, in the UK it's the aviation-medicine people I think) who
are far enough removed from the ongoing policy wars that they can
convincingly claim to be honest go-betweens.  Pious proclamations of good
intentions often are not enough to convince would-be reporters that their
names won't get back to management.

&gt;From: Heikki Pesonen &lt;LK-HPE%FINOU.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu&gt;
&gt;Subject:      RISKS in "Balance of Power"
&gt;There is a computer game about "Geopolitics in the nuclear age" called
&gt;BALANCE OF POWER.  It is sold at least for Commodore Amiga.  I bought one and
&gt;now master the beginners level -- being able to beat Soviet Union. ...

"Beat the SU?"  Chris Crawford, the author of the game, gave a talk about
its development to the Palo Alto CPSR chapter before the game was marketed.
His stated goal (which I might might have changed) was to have the world
survive 20 years avoiding TN war.  If you have beat the SU, I suggest
sending a nice little letter to Chris telling him how.  The fact that you
are Finnish will be even more of a kick.  Chris thinks, "It's only a game."
He was approached by several University Poli Sci Dept. as a teaching tool.

The RISK of simulations is quite real.  There exist several "games" which I
hear about in the "shadows."  They are played by non-computer "hard-ball"
people [I was informed (at LLNL) that George Schultz was one].  I can guess
it runs on an Apple II because of portability requirements.  No flashy
graphics.  I doubt if these models are validated in anyway.  Chris's game
was given serious scrutiny, [the graphics were seen as a major advance, as
well as the use of mice], but it apparently lacks some statistics.  Note: I
have not given you the name of the group which showed me this.  There are
other groups at the Livermore Lab (where I am allowed to visit) which do
things like tactical and strategic nuclear war simulations.  (I have played
the most visible tactical simulation named JANUS [objective: train middle
level officers use and abuse of nuclear weapons]: Blue team (me) was overrun
by Red team.)  There are also other National Labs, and at least 24 companies
each employing close to a thousand people each who simulate matters of
policy [perhaps RAND being the best known].

The US and the SU both have a propensity with technological toys.  Their
attraction is very powerful as adult games (lacking video).  As long
as the older politicians breed a healthy skepticism in the younger
politicians, we are probably okay.

&gt; There may be some risk in
&gt; designing games simulating international affairs, if they are seemingly
&gt; realistic.  Some childish people may take them as the truth.

About 10 years ago, here in the suburbs of Washington, DC, a video game was
introduced which simulated cars chasing pedestrians.  The game was shortly
removed, because people felt that the game was teaching kids that pedestrians
were fair game for motorists.

On the other hand, world conflict simulations may be useful:  I recall a game
used in some psychology experiments.  The game concerned trucks and limited
roadways.  The experimenters noted that the players found that cooperation
between players (sharing the roadways) gained more for each player than
hostile actions.

Note that 45 years ago, the Japanese war-gamed their intended attack on Midway
Island.  In their simulation, they lost.  They proceeded with the attack,
anyway.  They lost the real battle, too.

The same comments on the virus from a slightly different (vms) point of view.

Subject: HRISTMA comes but once a year, a virus may be forever.
Posted: 27 Dec 87 22:39:00 GMT
Organization: The ARPA Internet
 
     By now,  many of you will have heard of the (infamous) CHRISTMA EXEC
"virus" which infected BITNET/EARN/NETNORTH and virtually paralyzed IBM's
internal  network  for a day  or two.   For those who  haven't  seen  the
various postings on the BITNET LINKFAIL list, RISKS-FORUM Digest, etc., I
will summarize  (no flames for the oversimplifications in the interest of
brevity, please).  Originating as a "prank" on a German end-node on EARN,
this EXEC (i.e.  similar to a .COM file - and written in REXX, a DCL-like
language)  displayed,  when executed  on  an IBM  VM system,  a primitive
christmas tree on the terminal and then mailed itself to everyone on that
poor user's NAMES file (i.e.  personal mailing name list) before deleting
itself.   Of  course,  some  users  had network distribution lists  (e.g.
JNET-L,  MEDINF-L,  etc.)  defined  in  their  NAMES  file . . .       [I
personally received six copies of this EXEC from different sources - this
is probably not unusual.]
 
     While this was a significant problem on  BITNET/EARN/NETNORTH with a
fair number of VM/CMS nodes, the virus clearly could not infect VAXinated
nodes,  of  which  there  are  a  larger  number.   Also,  many  (usually
undergraduate) students on VM/CMS systems are denied network access, thus
limiting  the rate of  spread  of  the virus  beyond an  infected system.
However,  once the virus entered VNET,  IBM's internal  network of VM/CMS
systems,  things really took  off (all VM/CMS systems;   users with large
NAMES  files;   all  with  network access)  and  allegedly brought  their
network to a standstill.
 
     Initially,  the  problem  required  manual  intervention  by  system
managers to purge CHRISTMA  EXECs  from users'  readers -  but this could
only give a temporary remission in the disease.   Fortunately, a CHRISTMA
eradicator was written (by Eric Thomas, author of the LISTSERV software),
and  also  an ingenious  virus  was developed  (by  Hank ?,  sorry,  I've
forgotten)  to follow and destroy the original  CHRISTMA  virus  and then
self-destruct  in  mid-January.   So now  it's  eradicated like smallpox:
hmmm .  .  .  I expect that there may be another minor epidemic when some
users return from vacation.
 
     So,  what should we do?  Laugh at IBM?  Say "It can't happen to me."
Look  at  all  those experienced,  computer-wise  IBMers who ran CHRISTMA
EXEC.  Oh yes, there will be flames . . .    platitudes about NEVER using
any software which  you  haven't  written  yourself  -  or is  written by
someone  you  TRUST  ABSOLUTELY  :-) . . .   flames  about  chain letters
and viruses on the network . . .    their authors should be boiled in oil
/ set in RA81 air filter glue / sentenced to do 10 years of RSX SYSGENs /
locked  in  a room  with  only an IBM  PC  /  (substitute  your favourite
nightmare here).  Let's just think a little before flaming.
 
     Could a "harmless"  CHRISTMA-like virus attack a VAX/VMS system?   A
recent network posting (RISKS?, LINKFAIL?) mentioned the possibility of a
virus  hidden in SHAR files which are _executed_ as .COM  files to unpack
them.   SHAR files  are,  after  all,  an excellent method for _reliable_
software distribution over  gateways.   (This  is  not  meant  to reflect
negatively  on  Michael  Bednarek  in  any  way  -   VMSHAR  is  a  great
contribution and we all have used it or will use it.) But .  .  .  nobody
unpacks one of these distributions with  PRIVs turned on,  do we?   Could
such a virus, like CHRISTMA EXEC, replicate from a non-privileged account
(apart from doing a SET PROC/PRIV=ALL quietly in the middle of the file)?
Certainly,  VMS  Mail won't allow  wildcard SEND (and JNET won't allow  a
wildcard  SEND/FILE),  but,  for example,  a .COM  file could  do  a SHOW
LOGICAL/OUTPUT=CRACKER.TMP,   look  for  logicals  with  syntax  "jnet%",
"BITNET%",  "IN%",  etc.  and try mailing itself to these addresses.  (No
flames about  giving state secrets  to the enemy,  please.   Blind Freddy
could have seen that one.)
 
     We may not be able to read  a SHAR file in its entirety (looking for
a virus  in  a few thousand blocks  of code),  but I for one am certainly
going to "quarantine" it as far as possible, SEARCHing it for more than a
few key words before unpacking it  from a non-privileged (either  default
or authorized)  account.  Further suggestions from the more devious minds
on the list would be welcome,  please.  Ignorance may be bliss, but it is
definitely NOT SAFE.
 
     Most if not all  of us have public  domain  software running on  our
systems   -   or  programs  written  by   students   and  our  colleagues
(trustworthy,  of course :-} ).  How many VAX/VMS systems do _not_ use at
least  one piece of  DECUS  software?   This  PD  software,  even if  not
essential,  makes  life easier  and/or  saves hours  of  work.   Software
exchange isn't going to stop now,  nor should it.   We  must be vigilant,
both for our  own  safety,  and as a responsibility to colleagues on  the
network.   We must make  all reasonable efforts to check before executing
software ourselves or posting it to the net -  or making it available for
FTP or putting it  on a BITNET LISTSERV.   CHRISTMA EXEC comes but once a
year, but a virus can be forever.
 
     Comments from the Info-VAX gurus would be appreciated.  What are the
guidelines for "safe  software exchange"?   What are  the best methods of
checking software for viral  contamination,  granted that we are going to
continue to exchange it?

I am the systems administrator at a small software company here in Houston.
(Actually, we're right next door to NASA-JSC and in the McDAC building. 
Anyway...)
McDAC is very, very, very security conscious.  Armed guards and the like.
"Of course", you say, "it is because they deal in the highest of high
technology and in matters of national security."

I work for a small banking software company, Integrated BancSystems,
housed in the same building.  We develop software that deals "only" 
with things like loans, customer accounts, bank customer lists, etc.

Part of our product line is geared towards the latest fad (buzzword?):
LAN's.  PC clone LANS, to boot.

Before we got our LAN for development, we developed on UNIX systems, which
I felt were secure enough for our purposes.  Banks aren't a national security
problem, so they shouldn't require the high standards of security that our
upstairs neighbors have to take.  The LAN's based on IBM PC compatible
computers (Novell SFT II v2.0a in particular) have just blown a huge,
gaping hole in the side of banking security.
I have no particular problem with Novell, and feel that they are
representative of the state of technology in PC compatible based
LAN's.

Point by point:
1.  Passwords are not stored in an encrypted form.  Any person that gains
    the "supervisor" password, or has his "security equivalance" (sic)
    raised to "supervisor"; can go into the "syscon" utility, pick
    "User Information", pick a user's login name, and then pick
    "Password".  Voila'!  The user's password, in ascii, for all to see.
    (A friend claims he has broken the protection scheme that is used to
    write them to the file server's hard-drive, but I have yet to see
    him prove this on my system.)
    [Again, other than this (rather glaring) problem, I think Novell has
      done a rather fine job of making PC clones usable (to some limited
      degree. :-) ) ]

2.  Software products sold to banks are quite often very insecure.
    I feel this is a very important issue that Data Processing managers
    should look into. (Are they still called that in other businesses?)
    An example:
    The SMART software system -- an integrated package of "Spreadsheet",
    "Communications manager", "Time manager", "Database manager", and
    "Wordprocessor" -- advertises "personal file protection".  There
    are several problems with their implementaion of this idea.
    1.  Only wordprocessor files are actually encrypted with any
        sort of encryption algorithim.
        The spreadsheet files have their password stored within
        the first 256 bytes of text. This pattern can easily be
        discoverd by encrypting a file, then "dump"ing or "debug"ing
        that file and examining what is actually written to the disk...
    --&gt; Or you can just look down a couple of blocks, where the
        raw ascii spreadsheet is stored. &lt;--
    2.  Cursory examination shows that the password used as an
        encryption key is stored in the same way:
        within the first 256 bytes of data, in a simply permutated
        form.
    3.  [This problem is created by the user-unfriendly-ness of
        the SMART system when implemented on a LAN.  (It seems to
        have been originally written for standalone PC, and not
        modified to any great deal for LAN use.)]
        Many system administrators tend to lump all the users in
        "group" instead of "individual" directories, and then
        direct users to "password" their files.
        Reason:
        It is rather involved to set up seperate SMART working
        directories.  Each user must have his own directory of
        screen, printer, and keyboard drivers, along with 3 or 4
        parameter files, a configuration file, and several other
        miscellanious files.  This eats up i-nodes (and their
        equivalent), and takes a while to set up for a new user
        and to remove for an old user.

I feel that these two reasons are more than enough to cause concern
about bank security.
I've only been into computing on a large scale (large = bigger than
a Commodore 64) for only a year or so, and I have been able to easily
defeat the security on programs sold to us.

Disclaimer:  The problems listed above have been reported to the
  management of my company.  They agree that security is a very serious
  issue, one that should be paid a great amount of attention and time.
  Our software uses DES-style encryption in an effort to make up for
  the intrinsic weaknesses in MS-DOS / IBM-PC compatable computer
  security.

  [Hugh Miller writes about replacing human judgment with machine 
  judgment with respect to computer trading programs]
&gt;And how will we insure that such enormously complex systems
&gt;will not synergetically go plooey when pushed to their volume or price limits?

We don't.  They are self limiting much in the same way as icy roads
limit speed.  Those who exceed, die.

Even if the minute to minute trading is done using machine judgement,
the day to day, or some long term, will be done by humans, even if it
is just when to turn the machine on and off.  In the near future this
will mean trading strategies change daily and on a per company or per
trader basis.  There would be no incentive to share software as
"winning" depends on doing better than the next guy.

If a company has the resources to "plooey" the market before they suicide,
well, what keeps that company in check now?

The other day a posting included the phrase:
	"...DES - has the analysis behind the design been made public yet?"

This reminded me.  I looked into the whole DES controversy in some detail 
about a year and a half ago.  It may be out of date.  Here's a summary:

In 1973, when the NBS called for proposals for a national encryption
system, IBM's LUCIFER system was already in the final stages of development.  
It was good, by all reports so good that it upset the code-breaking side of 
the NSA.  Rather than approving LUCIFER as is, NSA modified it in several 
strange ways to create DES.

LUCIFER's key size was 128 bits; DES had a key size of only 56 bits.  
Thus, it is much more vulnerable to "brute force" attacks.  There are 
2**56 possible DES keys, and as large as this number may seem, it is tens 
of millions of times smaller than the number of possible keys in ciphers
approved for military use.

NSA's weakening of LUCIFER appears to have been deliberate.  According to
David Kahn, author of The Codebreakers, LUCIFER set off a debate within
NSA.  "The code-breaking side wanted to be sure that the code was weak
enough for the NSA to solve it when used by foreign nations and companies,"
he wrote in Foreign Affairs.  "On the other hand, the code-making side
wanted any cipher it was certifying for use by Americans to be truly 
good."  Kahn says that the resulting "bureaucratic compromise" made the key
shorter.  Alan Konheim, former manager of IBM's LUCIFER research project,
recollects, "If they [NSA] had had their way, they would have had 32
bits...I was told at one time that they wanted 40 bits, and at IBM we
agreed that 40 was not enough."

At the same time that the NSA shortened LUCIFER's key, it used classified 
criteria to redesign several numerical tables known as "substitution" or
"S" boxes.  These S boxes control permutations that are key to the DES 
algorithm, and NSA's critics have long suspected that the changes to them 
might make the system vulnerable to a "cryptoanalytic" attack.  In other 
words, the boxes might conceal a trap door.  

Despite repeated rumors, such a trap door has never been found.  However,
mathematicians have unearthed several peculiar properties in the S boxes,
properties that were not present in IBM's original design.  They have also
demonstrated the possibility of weakening the cipher by introducing hidden 
regularities into the S-boxes.  Still, no one has managed to use these 
discoveries to mount a successful cryptoanalytic attack on DES.  

The controversy over DES eventually subsided, but in late 1985 NSA suddenly, 
and gracelessly, abandoned the cipher.  Directly contradicting years of 
reassurances, Walter Dealy, then NSA's deputy director for communications 
security, told Science that he "wouldn't bet a plugged nickel on the Soviet 
Union not breaking [DES]".  People in the industry felt betrayed.  According 
to Herb Bright of Computation Planning Associates, quite an uproar ensued in 
the normally quiet halls of the American National Standards Institute when 
NSA announced new ciphers to replace DES.  

These ciphers are designed to be distributed as pre-sealed and tamper-
resistant integrated circuits.  The encryption algorithm hidden within the
chips is classified.  It remains unknown even to engineers who work with 
the chips.  Critics feel that such secrecy offers NSA the chance to build 
a real trap door into the chips.  Herb Bright: "With a hardware black box
you can describe several schemes that would be almost impossible to test 
for from the outside and could, in effect, constitute a hardware Trojan 
Horse".

My conclusion?  That NSA probably hadn't put a trap door into DES, but felt
that, what with all the heat it was taking anyways, that it might as well 
replace DES with a cipher that really did contain a trap door.  The new
cipher chips may indeed contain such a trap door, but so little is known 
about their internals that speculation has been uninteresting.

Further, it is impossible -- in principle -- for the agency to exonerate itself
from charges such as these as long as it promotes ciphers based on secrecy
rather than algorithmic inpenetrability.  Such ciphers do, I believe, exist
(I'm no expert) but that's another story.

  there has been interest in the subject dating back over 30 years.  Gypsy and
  other microwave devices are being managed by the Air Force Weapons Laboratory
  at Kirtland AFB, N.M., where more than 600 scientists and engineers held a
  secret conference on high-power microwave technology last December (AW&amp;ST,
  3 Nov 1986, p. 151).  Soviet physics publications also have shown an interest
  in such devices.  Gypsy can produce more than one gigawatt of power in short
  pulses at several percent efficiency and can be tuned over 0.8 - 40 GHZ. 
  Gypsy uses the virtual cathode oscilator (VIRCATOR) principle, under which an
  electron beam penetrates an anode mesh with a current density greater than
  the space charge limiting value.  The high negative charge beyond the anode
  represents a virtual cathode, in which the electrons bunch in phase and
  oscillate at stable frequencies.  "

I am a bit skeptical of American Express' verification methods, also.
Recently I decided that my AmEx plate was in sorry shape and I phoned
their toll-free customer service number to arrange for a new one.
After I made my request clear, I was transferred to another CSR who
asked me two questions (what SS# I put on my application, and
something else that I don't recall offhand now).  After I answered the
questions, I  was told that my replacement (new) card would arrive in
ten days (it arrived in three days).  

Does this mean that anyone who knows a bit about me can get my AmEx
plate, too?  Scary ...

Almost everyone who has talked about the question of "Why do stores want my
phone number on the charge slip?" have clearly never worked in retail sales
before ... something *always* goes wrong, and a phone number is a quick way for
the store to contact you.  Sure, MasterCard doesn't require it, but remember
we're talking about (often) fast transactions by people who are paid very
little to make sure details are correct.  I have been called at least a half a
dozen times to correct mistakes on those little charge slips.  It has saved me
lots of time later when I would have had to correct the mistake with the VISA
or MasterCard company when my memory of the incident and my receipts were long
gone.  I wish they didn't put my number on the same piece of paper as my
account number, but i'm glad they were able to get a hold of me.  
                                                                      /jordan

&gt;Organizations try circuitous ways to get the SSN.  For example, when one
&gt;gets or renews a driver license in California, he finds a place for
&gt;inserting the SSN but without explanation....

I just had my passport renewed.  On the renewal form, was a space for SSNs,
with the word "optional" in parentheses under the slot -- but the word had
been crossed out in pen.  I asked the (post office) clerk why, and he told
me that giving my SSN was no longer optional.  I assume that most people stop
asking questions after such a response, but I went on.  I asked if the SSN
was essential to receiving my passport, and the clerk said no!  He said that
if I did not put my SSN on the form, I would still get my passport, but that
the IRS would charge me a $5 penalty on my income tax returns.

Was the clerk making all of this up?  The whole thing sounds very strange.
Or does any or all of his story have a basis in fact?  I decided not to put
my SSN on the form, although if I was in a hurry to get the passport and
worried about delays, I might have included it to be sure the passport arrived.
The passport arrived about two-three weeks later, as expected, with no delays
and no warning about any future penalties.  Does anyone have an explanation?

  Amateur Radios Deadly?  Operators' cancer deaths evaluated
  
  TACOMA, Wash. (AP) -- Amateur radio operators in two states appear to die at
  abnormally high rates from several forms of cancer, suggesting a possible
  link between cancer and electromagnetic fields, according to data collected
  by a state epidemiologist.  Others cautioned that evidence has been
  inconsistent and that other factors may be involved.
  
  Dr. Samuel Milham Jr. of the Washington Department of Social and Health
  Services studied the deaths of 2,485 Washington and California ham operators
  between 1979 and 1984.  He reported in the American Journal of Epidemiology
  that 29 leukemia deaths would be expected in a group of people that size,
  but he found 36 deaths.  Statistically, the expected to find 72 lymphatic
  and blood-forming organ cancers, but found 89.  And he expected to find 67.6
  deaths from prostate cancer, but found 78.  The study "indicates that
  amateur radio operator licensees in Washington state and California state
  have significant excess mortality due to acute myloid leukemia, multiple
  myeloma nd perhaps certain types of malignant lymphoma," Milham reported.
  
  University of Colorado and Universtiy of North Carolina studies also have
  found unusually high levels of leukemia among children who live near power
  lines, he said.
  
  Dr. Noreen Harris, a Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department epidemiologist,
  questioned the data, "People living near power lines may be poor and other
  (cancer-causing) things may be in their environment," she noted.  
  
Some notes and questions I have:

1.  I remember reading in Omni or some other pseudo-science mag last
    year an article about the ill-effects of low-level ionizing
    radiation produced by things like 110VAC wires running through
    homes.  The individuals preforming the study were being lauded by
    most other 'serious' scientists.  Anybody else recall this?
2.  I feel Dr. Harris's remarks were very weak, especially since she's
    questioning someone else's not-so-accurate-data. "People living
    near power lines may be poor.."  We *all* live near power lines,
    that's how the stuff gets to our house! =:-&gt;.
3.  I realise that ham radio gear is not always shielded properly, etc,
    but how safe are we hackers from the stuff our 'puters put out?  I
    sat in front of a Commodore 64 and a TRS-80 Model I, Lv II for a total
    of 8 years, before, during, and after puberty. (TRS-80 at 9 years old!)
    What are the effects of high-level non-ionizing rad. on someone in
    the developmental stages of life, I ask.

Happy New Year to All - Except those program designers whose systems print
dates in the form such as 5/1/88. Now as far as I'm concerned this translates
to 5th January 1988, but then I live in England.  In North America I believe
that it would be the 1st May 1988.  The problems start when I have to use
programs designed in America on a computer situated in the UK - especially
during the first few days of each month when dates such as 5/6/88 occur!

If we must make a resolution for the new year, lets all promise to specify
the name of the month rather than its ordinal in all our programs.

The items about social security numbers reminded me of a series of computer
and administrative problems that arose at Boston College in the early 70s
when it was decided that students would no longer be identified by social
security numbers (nor by any other number!).  

Of course, all sorts of batch accounting and record keeping programs  depended
on a student number for processing.  So, a unique number was assigned to each
student unbeknownst to him/her.  Moreover, a mapping program was necessary to
relate the "secret" number to the social security number of students who had
enrolled before the ban.  When problems arose, it was tempting to let a student
know his/her number so that it would not happen again.  I believe they finally
decided to let all students know their numbers and that they began placing the
numbers on student IDs, because too many problems arose.  And, of course, many
students did not want to memorize another number and would have preferred the
old system.

MORAL:  Social security numbers as general-purpose identification numbers may
be less painful than the alternatives.


As long as I am delving into the fuzzy past, here are two more items that 
perhaps deserve to be in the RISKS history book.  Please excuse me if I do not
have perfect recall.


Subject:  Risks of Computers Obeying Newton's Laws

Around the mid-sixties, the Air Force ordered a Honeywell computer for delivery
to Rhein Main Air Force Base.  As I recall, it was about a million dollar 
computer.  When it arrived in the middle of the night at Rhein Main, no 
Honeywell people nor supply officers were on hand to oversee the unloading.
The computer was supposedly tied down to one of those material handling flatbed
vehicles that has a series of rollers on its surface.  You guessed it!  As the
driver turned to enter a hanger, the computer kept going straight ahead.

I heard that Honeywell was secretly happy because they did not expect to sell
many of these computers.  Now they had doubled their sales.

MORAL:  Computers are subject to the same laws of physics as other types of
cargo.


Subject:  Risks of Not Employing Configuration Management for Computer Software

Another one from the mid-sixties.  ---  A command and control system was 
developed by GE (I believe) for use at Ramstein Air Force Base.  The system 
deployed tactical aircraft during alerts.  However, the controllers in the
control center trusted their own judgments more than they trusted the system.

Nonetheless, over several years, various people tinkered with the hardware and
software and then rotated to other assignments.  GE techreps were also cut back
drastically during that period when the military did not wish to become 
dependent on contractor personnel in an operational environment.  Configuration
management documentation of changes was nonexistent.  A new commander decided
to use the system and so the first problem was to determine what they had.
Logically, they asked GE.  From what I understand, the GE proposal to 
inventory, analyze, and document the configuration was over $1 million.  Some
thought that GE took advantage of the situation but ......

MORAL:  One-of-a-kind systems require the same principles of configuration
management as systems that are produced in the thousands.

Regarding the comment in Risks 6.2 about being safe from virus if one has
the source code -- I might remind people to re-read Ken Thompson's paper
[Turing award lecture, Reflections on Trusting Trust, CACM 27, 8, August
1984] wherein the concept of an invisible virus was proposed -- the actual
virus was (to be) buried in the object code of the C compiler for Unix; its
object was that IF it were compiling the source code of the login module it
would insert a little piece of code that allowed it's creator always to log
on (the War Games "backdoor"); IF it were compiling the source code of the C
compiler itself it would merely copy itself at the appropriate place.  In
both cases there was no sign of the virus in the source code nor presumably
in the listing generated by the compiler; I don't know Unix much, but one
could also hypothesize the virus as also being clever enough to recognize
when it was compiling whatever standard debuggers and decompilers come with
the system as to insert in them code that made them protect (somehow mask a
user from seeing) the pieces of the virus in the object code if those tools
were used to look at object code.  Here a user could inspect the entire
source code of the system (or so he thought) and not find anything; if the
initial virus went out in very early versions of the compiler there would be
little chance of a user finding any uncontaminated ones with which to
compile the source code he was given.

(I stand neutral on whether such a virus was actually created and
released on the world; I don't know and the folklore has it both ways.
But that's not the point.)

    [Please be prepared for a LOT OF OVERLAP in the next few messages.
    Since this is such a popular topic, I'm not going to try to edit.
    Just omit the rest if you're fed up with this topic.  On the other
    hand, some very important points are being made, and the repetition
    may be in order to counteract some of the more simplistic views.  PGN]

"guthery%asc@sdr.slb.com" claims

&gt;... there is no protection in trying programs out with 
&gt;write-only harddisks or with privileges turned off.

Perhaps not.  It is, however, easy to show that if *no* state is
retained between the execution of one program and the execution of
another, the former program cannot affect the latter.  (Take away
its tape and a turing machine can no longer compute.)  This is a
very expensive solution, and infeasible for most people.

  [Another plug for Ken Thompson omitted...]

&gt;There are NO good reasons why software vendors shouldn't give you
&gt;the source code of any program they sell you.

(I daresay this depends on one's definition of a `good reason'....)

&gt;The reason they don't currently is because you could see what a mess
&gt;the program really is.

No doubt that is one reason.  Having in times of need disassembled
various programs back to source, I will agree that many are poorly
written.  I doubt that is the only, or even the main, reason most
vendors are unwilling to distribute sources.  (It is rather fun,
actually, to call a vendor and say: `Will you still not sell source?
Very well.  By the way, there is a bug in your leap year code.
Also, you left out a ``#'' in the startup routine where . . . .')
But this is all beside the point.  (Ah, yes, the *point*:)

&gt;As long as we willing to accept programs from software suppliers
&gt;without the source code we, irresponsibly in my view, accept undue
&gt;risk and invite disaster.

What, then, are we to do?  Form a software users' union?  (I am
only half joking.)  I would very much appreciate receiving source
code to the binaries I must run.  The vendors remain unwilling to
sell the code, and we do not have the time to write the software
ourselves.  We have no alternate suppliers who will sell source.
The only remaining option seems to be not to run the code at all.

&gt;		     IF YOU CAN'T READ IT, DON'T RUN IT

Unfortunately, this is not sufficient if the vendor of your software is not
trustworthy.  Ken Thompson's Turing Award Lecture in 1983 [CACM, Aug. 1984]
described how bugs not in the source code can end up in the executable.
Even if you compile every program given you, something must assemble or
compile the compiler.  Something must assemble that, etc., etc.  Unless you
are willing to bootstrap your software from the raw bits using source code
that you trust as an assistant during the bootstrap, there still may be
trojan horses.

From the lecture: "No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will 
protect from using untrusted code.... A well-installed microcode bug
will be almost impossible to detect."

When you buy a tool such as an automobile, you do not ask to see all of the 
engineering drawings and analyses to decide that the car is safe.  An 
amount of trust is necessary when using any technology.  Computers are 
general purpose tools and as such can hide many different faults.  If the 
source of the hardware or software is trustworthy, there should be fewer faults
and fewer still malicious faults.  The relative ease with which a single
employee can insert hidden bugs demostrates that care should be taken
in determining who is trustworthy.

Summary: No it ain't

In reply to guthery%asc@sdr.slb.com, who writes in RISKS 6.2:
&gt;There are NO good reasons why software vendors shouldn't give you the source
&gt;code of any program they sell you.

On the contrary, there are several good reasons.  Some of them have to do
with commercial advantage, i.e., not having one's work ripped off.  If Mr.
Guthery believes that this is not a legitimate concern, he obviously does
not make his living by selling software.

There is also a good technical reason: VERSION CONTROL, for purposes of
customer support.  Tech support is difficult and time-consuming enough when
one knows exactly what software the customer is running.  Shipping source
code is an open invitation to the customer to tweak the software to suit his
purposes --- but he will still expect the vendor to support that software,
answer questions about its behavior, track down bugs (possibly induced by
customer changes), etc.  The RISK introduced by source code distribution is
that program changes will be made by customers who don't fully understand
the program; we all know what that leads to.


On the original topic, Mr. Guthery's main argument was that source code
distribution would allow customers to inspect for trojan horses.  I don't
believe this; in large programs it is not difficult to hide trojan horse
code well enough to defeat even careful inspection.  Besides, he can't
seriously propose that no one ever run a program that they haven't
personally (or even corporately) studied; no one would ever get any useful
work done.  (Have you personally checked over every line in your operating
system lately?)

Moreover, source code distribution means that more people have a chance to
diddle the program!  Even if the original author is reliable, what about all
the people at the user's site?  Access to source code makes it *much* easier
to create a trojan horse version of a program.  Another way to put this is:
even if you've seen the source code, how do you know it matches the bits
you're executing today?

I don't know the solution to trojan horse attacks, but source code
distribution is not it.

I would like to comment on the assumption that having source will
protect you from Trojan Horses.  While this is frequently true, a
recent Turing Award Lecture has pointed out that it's not in general
true, because of the compiler bootstrapping problem.  The case made is
that a compiler can be written which detects attempts to recompile the
compiler and inserts code which detects attempts to compile the login
program and inserts code in that which allows bogus logins, as well as
replicating the code which modifies the compiler binary.  The
system is then shipped with the binary of the trojan horse compiler
and the source for the valid compiler.  Even when you completely
rebuild the system from sources you still get the compiler and login
program with the trojan horse.  Nothing short of dissassembly of the
original compiler or using an outside compiler will work, and using an
outside compiler usually isn't feasible.

At some point you have to trust somebody.

 &gt;Subject: Source Code is Counter to Viruses &amp; Trojan Horses
 &gt;.. there is no protection in trying programs out with write-only harddisks 
 &gt; or with privileges turned off.  Doing this only sets the hook deeper.  
     Running a program with write protection and restricted privileges
does give limited protection which is better than no protection. 
 &gt; .. anytime you run a program whose complete workings you do not ... 
 &gt; understand you are  ... at risk.
     Agreed.  But very few people completely understand any program.
 &gt; One ... way to counter viruses and trojan horses is to insist on getting
 &gt; the source code ... IF YOU CAN'T READ IT, DON'T RUN IT
     True, if you read it.  Reading and understanding source code for a non
trivial program is very difficult.  Don't forget that you would also have
to read the source code for the compiler, linking loader and run time
libraries.  I haven't the time. 
 &gt; There are NO good reasons why software vendors shouldn't give you the source
 &gt; code of any program they sell you.  The reason they don't currently is 
 &gt; because you could see what a mess the program really is.  ...
     There are lots of good reasons for not giving source code.  One is
that it is easier to break protection of programs if source code is
available.  Another is cost: source code is more expensive to distribute
than binaries, especially when required documentation is included.  It
might also be necessary to supply compilers, etc.  (Also with source code.)
For example, DEC has written a lot of programs in BLISS which is a product
(translation: you pay for BLISS).  There is a major RISK to the company
that the user will "improve" the product.  If these "improvements" add
bugs, whose fault is it and how easy is it to prove?  Vendors also worry
that giving source code will make the job of pirates much easier.  When
vendors do supply source code, they are often reluctant and charge heavily
for it.
 &gt; In 999 cases out of 1,000 they don't know everything the program does 
     Do you think you will do better than the supplier?  
 &gt; ... think of all the execute only software you run ... [,] all the
 &gt; companies from whom you purchased this software ...[and] all the
 &gt; pressure you put on them for bug fixes, new features, and lower prices.
 &gt; Think about the translation of these pressures into pressures on
 &gt; programmers.  Suppose one of these programmers decides to get .. even.
     Sure, this is a risk.  But who do you trust? If you do all the checking
yourself you may not have time to do anything else.  Delegate the job to
someone else at your organization? Do you have the extra people? How do you
know to trust them? Managing source code is a major task.  A vendor will
normally have quality controls in place.  If you buy software, there are
lots of other copies of the program running elsewhere and bugs (including
viruses, trojan horses) are more likely to be found.  In certain cases such
as banks or defence applications it may be necessary to do source checks to
verify the code, but doing so is very expensive and for most users not
worth the cost.  Finally, it is much easier to create (better!) viruses,
etc if source code is available than if not.
     We may be talking from different directions: I am a user, perhaps you
are a hacker.  If that is so, then our approaches to protection will be
different.  My feeling is that if I don't know what it is at some level of
confidence, I won't run it. 
     You will never stop a dedicated crook: all you can do is make his/her
job harder based on an assessment of the risk vs the cost of protection.  I
feel the cost of source checking is very high.  Any protection system,
computer or otherwise, will only guard against people who are basically
honest, or lazy, or of limited competence, or with limited time.  The
majority of people fall under one of more of these categories.  Limited
measures will cut out the vast majority of threats.

&gt;I'm surprised nobody has mentioned this:  Around here we don't "execute"
&gt;shar files to unpack them.  Instead there is a handly little utility called
&gt;"unshar".  I use a version on both Unix and my Amiga microcomputer.
   ---

The problem is compounded on IBM VM/CMS systems (where CHRISTMAs EXEC took
its toll) by an often overlooked "feature" of the standard IBM "receive"
command.  Files such as EXECs are usually sent in a special encoded form
called NETDATA format.  The "receive" command is smart enough to determine
the format of the file and decode it appropriately, as is the "peek" command
used to browse a file before receiving it.  BUT... the NETDATA encoding also
allows for multiple files to be combined into one NETDATA stream.  The file
appears with only the attributes of the first file in the stream, and only
the first file appears when "peeked".  When the unsuspecting victim performs
the "receive", the remaining files are ALSO received with REPLACE IMPLIED!

Building such a "nested" NETDATA deck is not common knowledge, but can be
done using the undocumented internal module used by sendfile/receive.  The
now infamous CHRISTMA EXEC could just as easily contained a PROFILE EXEC
behind it that would format your A-disk the next time you logged on.  Thus
even if you did read the source code for CHRISTMAs and trashed it upon
discovery of its function, your next logon would result in erasure of your
entire A-disk (and also any evidence of what caused it to occur).

There is a semi-public-domain overlay for RECEIVE available on any Bitnet
NETSERV server which detects multiple datasets in a NETDATA stream.  Any
concerned IBM CMS user out there should investigate this utility.

     This probably should have been mentioned earlier, as I'm sure it's
of interest to quite a few people.  I can't speak for either the
comp.sources.unix or comp.sources.misc archives (though, as a side note,
I couldn't find any unshar programs in the comp.sources.unix archive
that is maintained here at Purdue), but there *is* an unshar program in
the comp.sources.amiga archives.  I'm not absolutely certain, but I
believe that the version we have is the one that Bryce was writing about
above.

     If anyone might want a copy of this program source code (in C),
it's available via anonymous ftp from j.cc.purdue.edu in the amiga
source archives (the directory it's in is news/comp/sources/amiga/volume1,
and the filename is unshar.c.Z).  It's written with portability in mind,
so it should compile and run under a variety of systems, but we've only
tested it under UNIX and on the Amiga so far.  Also, the file in the
archives is compressed (UNIX "compress" utility), so ftp should be set
to "binary" mode to insure a correct transfer.

One of my clients has just reported to me that a certain brand of
PC-compatibles which they sold in 1984 suddenly stopped working when 1988
was reached.  They were flooded with calls on Monday and the manufacturer of
the equipment also got many reports then.

If your PC-compatible suddenly stopped working on New Years' Day and the first
letter of its name is "S", you may want your dealer to check for this unlikely
problem.

Thanks to my mother-in-law and the USPS, I now have the article I mentioned
in RISKS 5.84.  The article is from the December 24, 1987 edition of the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  The page 1 article is titled "Decision Threatens
Punch-Card Elections" and is quoted without permission.

"If a federal judge's order this week is upheld, it could eliminate the punch-
card voting system, throw elections here [i.e., in Missouri] into chaos and 
cost taxpayers missions of dollars, election officials said Wednesday.

But civil-rights groups hailed the decision as a landmark that they say will
increase the participation of blacks in elections.

U.S. District Judge William L. Hungate ordered Tuesday that the St. Louis
Election Board 'take appropriate steps' for a manual count of ballots that
are cast but uncounted by the city's automatic tabulating equipment due to
such problems as double voting in one category and not pushing the pin all
the way through the ballot.

Representatives of the Election Board criticized Hungate's ruling and said
they expected it to be overturned on appeal...

Garvin [an attorney for the board] said the board might ask the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to postpone the effect of Hungate's order until after 
the Missouri presidential primary March 8.

The punch-card voting system is used throughout Missouri.  But Garvin said
he thought no other jurisdiction would follow Hungate's ruling unless it
was affirmed on appeal...

In the judge's order, he said it was not the punch-card voting system but
the board's actions that violated federal voting laws.  But election officials
said the ruling could have the same effect...

Punch-card voting accounted for 70 percent of the votes in the last 
presidential election in Missouri.

Hungate gave his order in a suit filed by Michael V. Roberts, an unsuccessful
candidate in the primary March 3 for the president of the St. Louis Board
of Aldermen.  Roberts, who is black, lost by 171 votes to Thomas A. Villa,
who is white.

Roberts claimed the punch-card voting system discriminated against blacks
because most of the votes cast but not counted by the Election Board's 
computers came from wards where most of the voters are black.

In his order Tuesday, Hungate said the board's failure to review by hand
ballots left uncounted by the machines violated the federal Voting Rights
Act and resulted in the disenfranchisement of voters.

Garvin said that in most elections, a large number of voters do not vote
on every ballot issue.  He said that while the board's computers could be
programmed to identify ballots for which no votes register on some issues,
the number would be so great that it would make the punch-card system
unworkable. . .

Kenneth Warren, a political science professor at St. Louis University,
called Hungate's ruling 'devastating for the punch-card voting system;
in effect, it is doing away with the system. . .

Warren [who testified for the board at the trial] said about 60 percent
of voters in the United States used the punch-card system. . .

Miriam Raskin, the assistant executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Eastern Missouri, said she was thrilled by the decision.
the ACLU had entered the case on behalf of Roberts."

Snippet on a software developer who wants to prove there is a
market for computer prank hacks, from PC Week, 22/29 Dec 1987, Pg 28:

    "Weirdware, a division of Mainland Machine, a software
  developer in San Luis Obisbo Calif., markets for $19.95 a
  practical joke generator it calls PC Prankster.  The software
  includes 10 pranks that the owner can play on unsuspecting
  friends or prospective enemies.

    "The pranks weren't designed to be malicious or destructive,
  said John Ames, a software engineer at Mainland Machine.  First,
  the jokester has to store one of the prank files on the intended
  victim's hard disk or boot disk.  Once that's done, the
  perpetrator can set the joke to go into action after a certain
  number of keystrokes right in the middle of whatever program the
  victim is running at the time.

   "In one joke, the figure of a huge one-eyed monster appears on
  the screen, blinks and disappears, allowing the program to resume
  operation unaltered.  Other pranks briefly scrambles the PC
  character set, or makes the monitor screen appear to be cracking.

One must ask whether Milham controlled for the age of his subjects;
amateur radio is very popular among retired persons and advanced age
is one of the major risk factors for all kinds of cancer (rates go
up roughly as the 4th power of age, if I recall correctly).  Amateur
radio operators are also fairly likely to build some of their own
equipment; in the process they are exposed to the fumes of over-heated
solder flux (I remember a considerable burning sensation in my nose
when using rosin-core solder) and are exposed to considerable levels of
lead.  Finally, it seems to me that hams smoke a lot (a study would
be required to really know); and the effects would be worsened by a
tendency to spend a lot of time in a small room huddled over a Morse
code key.

With respect to power lines: I think that high-voltage long-distance
power lines were probably what was meant.  I went to high school and
college in North Carolina (location of one of the studies); it seems to
me that such power lines indeed seemed to cluster near other sorts of
cancer-causing facilities.  For example, they frequently ran near
highways (I-40 from Statesville to Morganton had power lines along its
whole length).  Furthermore, they (of course) ran mostly through rural
areas; people living near them were likely to be engaged in agriculture,
meaning the use of pesticides, meaning that they were exposed to a high
and well-documented risk of various sorts of cancer.  In North Carolina,
in particular, they would likely be growing tobacco!

This is not to say that non-ionizing radiation cannot contribute to
cancer rates, although, based on my current (lay) understanding of the
mechanisms of cancer induction, I am inclined to doubt that the effect
could be strong.  Nor do I wish to cast doubt on the meaningfulness
of all such studies: one can never control all the variables, and thus
can never prove anything beyond all doubt; however, one must certainly
control those variables which have been established to have significant
effects on one's independent variable (cancer risk in this case).

&gt; 3.  I realise that ham radio gear is not always shielded properly, etc,
&gt;    but how safe are we hackers from the stuff our 'puters put out?  ...

   Ham radio gear is usually very well sheilded.  The equipment itself may
not be the problem.  Operators are frequently in close proximity to the
transmitting antennae, and thus can be on the receiving end of a large
amount of radiated energy.  I observed this phenomenom first hand in 1973
after I had installed a new beam antenna on the roof of my house.  With the
antenna pointed in my direction, full power output would cause both
florescent and incandescent bulbs in the room to light up.  (Some specifics:
appx. 800 watts output into a 9 db gain beam located about 20 feet higher and
30 feet away from my location.) I found the effect quite disconcerting and 
avoided high transmission power levels in my direction.

   This may seem an unusually high level of exposure, but it is far more
common than most people realize.  What is important is not total power
but power density.  Hand held portable radios are widely used now, in
public service and private operations alike. Typically, these radios use 
"rubber duck" antennae that are mounted to the top of the unit, only inches
from the eyes.  At this distance, power densities are quite high, even with
power output levels below 5 watts. Some reports have pointed to increased 
risk of glaucoma from use of these radios.

   As far as home computers go, the risk is probably very small.  About
two years ago both the SIGGRAPH and SIGCHI groups of ACM ran technical
sessions in their national conferences on the human factors / risks
involved in using computer displays.  For reasonably modern equipment,
the emmitted radiation levels were typically less than background levels.
As an example, broadcast radio stations several miles away showed up 
in spectrum analysis at power density levels much higher than CRTs at
the screen surface.  More significant risks from the use of computer
systems included back pain from poor ergonomic design of workstations,
and skin irritations.  The latter occur as CRTs tend to precipitate
out airborne particulates due to static charge on the screen.
People will touch the screen and spread such material on their skin.
The "high tech" solution for this problem was to clean the screens
daily.  

   The terminal screen I'm using right now looks somewhat dusty --
time to get out the anti-static screen cleaner!

Many ATMs are in small rooms which you enter by putting your bank card into
a card reader.  I had been wondering how it knew to let you in, since cards
from out-of-town banks work, and there's no noticible pause for it to look
up your institution to see if you should have access.

Yesterday I tried an experiment, and discovered that my AT&amp;T calling
card, and even a rapid transit pass would open the door.  I think
their algorithm is "if there are bits on the card, unlock the door".

What's the interest to RISKS (besides sharing more ATM trivia, which
flourishes here)?  The reverence people hold for technology.  The magnetic
stripe and card reader imply a computer, so people think that they have
controlled access.  Most people would never think to question it, and don't
know what shortcuts are taken.  The mistake will come when someone wants to
use one of those cardreaders to control access to a room where the security
really does matter.

&gt; Unfortunately, this is not sufficient if the vendor of your

We seem to be trying to solve several different problems here, and
that may be part of the confusion.  Having the source to a piece of
public domain software might help you find out what it's going to do
to you.  At least it's better than a kick in the pants.  You
generally have little other recourse in the case of a piece of
software the originator won't support.

On the other hand, untrustworthy vendors have entered into a
contract with you, and the fact that they (or one of their
employees) injected a virus into the program they sold you is quite
a different matter.

&gt; When you buy a tool such as an automobile, you do not ask to see all
&gt; of the engineering drawings and analyses to decide that the car is
&gt; safe.  An amount of trust is necessary when using any technology.

But surely not blind trust.  There are whole organizations set up to judge
cars on their abilities to perform according to specification, and the
informed buyer is always able to read those reports and make the appropriate
judgement.  Since testing isn't always enough, there is also a legal
mechanism to sue in cases where the product fails to perform.  It seems no
one cares enough yet to test software thoroughly (not even mass-market
stuff).  Not sure why.

When I first saw this, I wondered what good a write-only hard disk would be
in this application (or in any other, for that matter).  I had to read on a
bit, and then backtrack, to guess that this probably should have been a
read-only hard disk.  Seemingly, no one else wondered about this, because
the line was quoted two times in the next issue of Risks, without any signal
(the usual one is to write 'sic' in parenthesis after the word) that this
may be an error in the original.

If you think this is quibbling, then you must answer the question:
how well can you proof-read a piece of source code for subtleties?

Consider:  the original author missed it, the moderator missed it, and at
least those two who quoted it (and can therefore be assumed to have spent
some time considering the quote) in Risks 6.2 missed it.  Each read what
they wanted to read there, and not what really was there.  Exactly how I

[The following is an article I posted on the subject of Cancer and Electro-
magnetic Radiation.  I have received several replies on my posting; two
disputed Dr. Milham's statistics based on Poisson distributions, and one mailed
an article on Milham's previous article in 1985 in Lancet.   Barry]

In yesterday's newspaper, I noticed with great interest an article entitled

          "Link suggested between cancer,  electromagnetic fields."

The article had the byline of the Associated Press, Tacoma, WA.  It was
stated in the article that "amateur radio operators in two states appear to
die at abnormally high rates from several forms of cancer, suggesting a
possible link between cancer and electromagnetic fields, according to data
collected by a state epidemiologist."  This article appears to be prompted
by work published in the American Journal of Epidemiology by Dr. Samuel
Milham Jr. of the Washington Department of Social and Health Services.
According to the article, Dr. Milham studied the deaths of 2,485 Washington
and California amateur (ham) radio operators between 1979 and 1984.  Based
on a population this size, he found the following data:

                               Expected                  Actual
     Cause                      Deaths                   Deaths
     ------------------------  -----------------------  -----------
     Leukemia                     29                       36
     Lymphatic &amp; Blood Forming
         Organ Cancers            72                       89
     Prostate Cancer              67.6 (!)                 78

I am not sure about the statistical differences between these numbers, but I am
certain that a trained epidemiologist would check the statistical significance
of his data before publishing.  Dr. Milham is further reported to have
concluded that "amateur radio operator licensees in Washington state and
California have significant excess mortality due to acute myloid leukemia,
multiple myeloma and perhaps certain types of malignant lymphoma."

The Associated Press article also quoted Leonard Sagan, program manager for
radiation studies at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, CA.
Sagan warned that studies like Dr. Milham's could be misinterpreted, and that
the "findings could be simple associations that have nothing to do with cancer
causes among people who work with electricity."

Having been an amateur radio operator for over twenty-three years, and having
been concerned with the safety of exposure to non-ionizing, radio frequency
electromagnetic energy as a small portion of my job, I have a few comments
about this article.  Before I begin, I should state that my title of Dr. is not
a medical one, but rather a PhD in Engineering.  I should also state that I
have not yet read the article in the American Journal of Epidemiology.

The medical effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation have been shown to
be frequency dependent.  This is logical since as the wavelength of radiation
approaches the dimensions of the human body, absorption of the radiation is
enhanced due to more efficient coupling into the body.  At higher frequencies
(shorter wavelengths), typically in the microwave region, the electromagnetic
radiation is absorbed near the surface of the body.  The ANSI standards for
exposure to radio frequency energy take this information into account, placing
the most strict requirements on frequencies in the VHF (very high frequency)
region.  Amateur use of the VHF spectrum, while dating back over fifty years,
has primarily been negligible until twenty years ago.  Amateur transmitter
power levels in the VHF region have generally been much lower than the power
levels used in the high frequency bands.  Antenna placement for VHF, in terms
of wavelengths from the amateur's operating position, is generally high.  These
three facts would tend to cancel the increased hazard of VHF radiation.  To
test Milham's hypothesis further, a study of FM broadcast engineers, commercial
two-way radio technicians, and television transmitter engineers should be
performed since these persons are all exposed to various levels of VHF
radiation.  The highest field strengths to which amateur radio operators are
normally exposed come from the near field antenna radiation during high
frequency operation.  Power levels of up to two kilowatts may be used with
antenna placement often below a wavelength.  It should be noted that exposure
to this power level is intermittent in most amateur operation.  If Milham's
hypothesis is correct, broadcast technicians and engineers for commercial AM
and especially short wave broadcast stations, as well as military communication
operators should show even higher levels of cancer deaths than hams.  Operation
on microwave frequencies by amateur radio operators is rare; furthermore, I
would expect any cancers caused by microwaves to be other than deep tissue
cancers.  A study of the eyes for cataracts would be in order, too, since
microwave exposure generally causes eye problems prior to additional damage in
the human body.

I believe that other causality should be investigated by the medical profession
before Dr. Milham's conclusions are accepted.  I would expect that the amateurs
studied by Dr. Milham were mostly individuals who had been hams for many years.
An analysis including the length of time that the amateurs were licensed (or at
least active) would be in order.  I believe that this analysis would show some
increased mortality (adjusted for age, of course) for the older hams.  If this
increased mortality exists, I feel that other environmental factors should be
studied in addition to exposure to electromagnetic fields.

Until twenty-five to thirty years ago, much of the amateur radio equipment in
use was home constructed.  The construction of electronic equipment at this and
especially prior years, exposed the amateur to a number of chemical hazards,
many of which were not known as hazards at the time.  For example, I would
expect to see higher than normal levels of metals in older hams such as tin,
lead, bismuth, antimony, and cadmium (from soldering); mercury (from broken
rectifier tubes and relays); barium, beryllium, and rare earth oxides (from
broken vacuum tubes and phosphors from cathode ray tubes); radium (from
luminescent dials); selenium (from rectifiers); and manganese and zinc (from
batteries).  Likewise these hams would have been exposed to rosin fumes
containing numerous organic acids (from soldering), paint solvents and cleaning
fluids such as benzene and carbon tetrachloride, phenol (from burnt phenolic
insulators), and asbestos.  Even more insidious, however, was the exposure to
transformer and capacitor impregnating oils.  These oils often contained
poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) as flame retardants, sometimes in quite high
concentrations.

These chemical hazards were not unique to amateur radio operators only.  Other
electronic hobbyists as well as people manufacturing electronic equipment would
have been exposed to similar hazards.  I feel that it would be prudent to
compare mortality rates of workers in oil-filled capacitor manufacturing plants
to those of the hams studied [for example, the Sangamo capacitor plant in
Pickens, SC, which until several years ago was a major user of PCB oils].

In conclusion, I believe that other causal relationships between cancer deaths
and amateur radio operators may more adequately explain Milham's data.  I
propose that Milham or other epidemiologists expand their study to include the
other occupations I have suggested above.  I further propose that age-adjusted
mortality rates be calculated for the existing data to determine whether length
of exposure or date of exposure is significant and whether chemical exposure of
these hams might be significant.  I am certain that electromagnetic radiation
has effects on the human body, but I do believe that electromagnetic radiation
is not the major cause of the increase in cancer deaths as stated by Dr.Milham.

For those persons interested in further study on the effects of electromagnetic
radiation, I would suggest the American National Standards Institute document
ANSI C95.1-1982, Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio
Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 300 kHz to 100 GHz.  This standard contains
an appendix listing numerous references on the biological effects of
radio-frequency electromagnetic fields.  A number of other standards exist for
radio-frequency and microwave exposure; many of these are listed in the
Microwave Engineer's Handbook, Vol. 2.

If anyone has read Dr. Milham's original article, I would appreciate their
sending me the exact title and the date of publication so I might have our
library order a copy.  I would also appreciate the comments of other amateurs
as well as physicians on this subject.  Please email responses directly to me
and I will summarize or cross-post your replies to both rec.ham-radio and
sci.med (many hams on ARPA receive their postings via an automatic mailing list
rather than a newsgroup).

Thanks and 73 [ham radio jargon for best regards].

I also noted Dr Milham's study of ham radio operators vs cancer
statistics.  The press report was undoutably mangled, but as a sometime
radio amateur, I can add some questions and comments. 

Was there any analysis of the actual RF exposure to the amateurs?
Typical amateur radio operations involves &lt;&lt;50% of time spent in actual
transmission.  Typical frequencies range from 3.5 to 220 MHz, and power
levels from 5 W to 1 kW.  Emission modes vary, but single-sideband voice
is most common up to 30 MHz; SSB duty cycles are &lt;&lt;100% even when
transmitting.  Antennas range from large yagi arrays on high towers to
loaded 1/4 wave "rubber duckies" held next to the head while using VHF
handheld equipment.  Many licensees are inactive, too. 

Was there any demographic control?  Ham operators have a peculiar
distribution, with "peaks" among young-adult techies and retired
middle-class WASP males. 

Hams expose themselves to various other potential hazards: solvents
and smoke during soldering, PCBs from transformer and capacitor oils,
etc.  Why should one suspect RF exposure in particular? 

Apparently the study came out in a reputable journal, so it may
deserve a better review than the AP (and we) are giving it.

Eric Townsend's note raises the possibility of a
  &gt;  link between cancer and electromagnetic fields
in the context of a study of cancer cases among ham radio operators.

I would not be surprised to find a link between ham radio operation and cancer
for a completely unrelated reason:  Ham radio operators tend to work with
electronics, exposing them to many interesting chemicals in the process,
including lead vapor from hot solder and vaporized solder flux, not to mention
coil dope, red glypt, and other oddities.  Older ham radio equipment
frequently contained large oil-filed capacitors (possibly containing PCB
oils), and who can forget the ozone smell caused by the high plate voltages
used by pre-1970 transmitters.

I don't mean to imply that there is no risk associated with the high fields
around a radio transmitter, after all, you can cook hot-dogs by putting them
inside the antenna impedence matching coils, but there are other possible
causes of the small increase in cancer risk that was observed.

A good experiment to test these risks would be to look at the cancer rate
among model railroaders.  They also solder things and work with related
chemicals, but the electric fields they are exposed to are produced by a
source with a maximum power of 12 watts (12 volts at one amp, DC power to
the track).

   I've just finished K. Eric Drexler's _Engines_Of_Creation_ and my brain-pan
is bubbling with peculiar and fascinating thoughts. I'll list a few of them
here, hoping to start off discussions in the appropriate newsgroups. People
on USENET and the institutions they represent are likely to be at the leading
edge of the nanotechnology revolution. If Drexler's estimates are anywhere
near correct it's none too soon to start thinking about benefits, risks, costs
and strategies.

   In arranging the questions below I have tried to order them by increasing
'softness', i.e. the extent to which answers must involve social and ethical
judgement as opposed to matters of hard technical fact.

   I have cross-posted to many groups because the potentials and pitfalls
of nanotechnology are so sweeping that multi-disciplinary thinking will be
not only appropriate but utterly necessary. For some of the points below,
I have indicated individual newsgroups where discussion may end up.

   0. Is Drexler or the the Foresight Institute on the net?

   1. Drexler claims that there are no fundamental physical limitations in
the way of nanotechnology. He points at life itself as a feasibility proof.
Is this appropriate? Might his smaller, "harder" nanosystems be critically
vulnerable to thermal noise, quantum effects, background radiation? Can we
estimate the mean frequency of disruptive events as a function of feature
size, perhaps using data from soft errors in ICs as a baseline?

   2. (comp.ai) Is his vision of the near-term potential of AI too sanguine?
Without reopening the perennial theological debates on strong AI, what is the
sense of experts in the field on the feasibility of the intelligent engineering
assistants he sees as important for nanotechnology? Does an expert system
for engineering design need the elusive "common sense"? What, if anything, can
we say in advance about special problems or helpful structure of nanotechnology
as a design problem domain?

   3. (comp.risks) Drexler discusses countermeasures to the "Gray Goo" threat
(i.e. the possibility of nanomachines programmed or misprogrammed to make
copies of themselves without limit). In doing so, he picks what is perhaps the
easiest disaster case to guard against, because it would become obvious very
quickly, they aren't likely to be invulnerable to atomic weapons, and there
would be few reasons not to nuke an expanding blob of the stuff.
   It seems that "invisible" nanoplagues would be far more dangerous (imagine
a "vampire" replicator programmed to seek and destroy hemoglobin molecules,
replicating only for some fixed period of time after finding one, and then
seeking another host). What countermeasures against invisible nanoplagues can
we imagine? Might analogies from biological warfare be helpful?

   4. (comp.risks) Along the same lines: Drexler talks about "sealed labs" as
development environments, advancing one concept design for a tiny nanolab
surrounded by shells of diamond, explosives, thermite, etc. primed to destruct
on tampering. What about tampering from the *inside*? Can we imagine trigger
mechanisms that are reliable in the face of attacks by programmable
nanomachines directed by someone who wants to crack the lab? (perhaps something
could be done with isotopic abundances and dead-man sensors?).

   5. Do combinations of nanoassemblers and disassemblers imply a practical
capacity for matter duplication at the molecular level? If so, what of the
possibilities for counterfeiting? 'teleportation' of complex objects? Might
the duplicatable objects eventually include human beings?

   6. Even with only partial matter-duplication, nanotechnology implies
economic dislocations that will make the First Industrial Revolution (steam
and steel) and the Second (computers) look like garden parties. It looks as
though the valuables of the future will be human attention, design information,
and elemental raw materials. Can we project the kind of economy this implies?
How should we expect the stages of transition to it depend on plateaux of
duplication capacity?

   7. Even if economic change did not generally force social change, mature
nanotechnology would imply some novel problems -- for example, might the huge
increase in the Earth's carrying capacity due to assembler/disassembler
technology lead to a Malthusian population explosion and the cannibalization
and collapse of the natural biosphere? Or can we expect the explosion to
take place into the rest of the Solar System?
   In view of our poor past record at protecting irreplaceable biomes against
destructive development once it became economically feasible, is there reason
to think we can solve the problem with social and legal controls this time?
Do the special characteristics of nanotechnology suggest any technological fix?

   8. What social changes can we project for coping with the huge increases in
personal wealth (= power to manipulate matter and energy to taste) implied by
nanotechnology? What do the effects of past increases suggest? Are these
suggestions really applicable?

   9. (talk.politics.theory) In theory, individuals owning self-repairing
nanotechnological molecular fabricators could opt out of what remains of the
material economy. Is this a recipe for a non-Marxian withering-away of the
State? What happens to politics when 'redistribution of wealth' is as dead as
high feudalism? Is this a recipe for anarcho-libertarian utopia?

   10. What can we do *here* and *now* to accelerate and guide the development
of nanotechnology (so that, for example, as many of us as possible can use
nanomachine-based medical technology to choose to live healthy lives until
accident or our own choices kill us).

   I hope to begin a continuing discussion of these issues. If volume is high
enough to warrant it, I will volunteer to manage a mailing list and/or
moderate a newsgroup.

   For the moment, I suggest that articles be cross-posted to misc.misc.

From The Fort Worth Star Telegram's Startext Information Service:

Hebrew University computers sabotaged by electronic "virus'

  JERUSALEM (AP) -- A saboteur infected Hebrew University computers with an
electronic "virus" that threatens to destroy thousands of files and wipe out
years of research, a university employee said Thursday.
  "It is the most devastating thing we've ever come across," said Yisrael
Radai, a senior programmer at the university's computer center.
  A "virus" is computer jargon for a self-propagating set of orders devised by
a saboteur that spreads from one computer disk to another to cause mischief or
harm.
  Radai said that soon after the virus was discovered last week, university
computer experts developed an antidote to diagnose and treat it. But there is
still a danger that many users will not learn they have been affected until it
is too late.
  The virus threatened to wipe out research data, financial statements,
ledgers, lists of students and other vital information compiled by
administrators, teachers, and students.
  Radai said other institutions and individuals in Israel have been
contaminated. In fact, anyone using a contaminated disk in an IBM or
IBM-compatible computer was a potential victim, he said.
  The virus was devised and introduced several months ago by "an evidently
mentally ill person who wanted to wield power over others and didn't care how
he did it," Radai said.
  He said the saboteur "had to be very clever because he knew how to write
directly into the disk controller and evade the computer's ordinary
safeguards."
  The saboteur exploited a standard programming technique to insert the virus
into the computer's memory, said Radai.
  The computer infected all disk files exposed to it and they, in turn,
contaminated healthy computers and disks.
  Radai said the saboteur's target date to wipe out the files was Friday, May
13, 1988. Unless computer users apply the antidote developed by the university,
they will lose disks afflicted with the virus on that day.
  Meanwhile, the saboteur decided to wreak some minor havoc. His virus ordered
contaminated programs to slow down on Fridays and the 13th day of the month.
  But the prank was the first obvious indication something was wrong with
apparently healthy computer disks, said Shai Bushinski, a self-employed
computer expert knowledgeable about the virus.
  Another clue was derived from a flaw in the virus itself.
  Instead of infecting each program or data file once, the malignant orders
copied themselves over and over, consuming increasing amounts of memory space.
  Computer experts noticed that supposedly static programs were inexplicably
growing in size and launched a search for the cause.
  Bushinsky said experts isolated the malignant commands, which appeared in
easily decipherable assembly language.
  Within a few hours three university computer experts devised a two-phased
program, called "immune" and "unvirus," which tells users whether their disks
have been infected and applies an antidote to those that have.
  Bushinsky said the computer virus was a new and dangerous development in the
computer world that could penetrate military, industrial and commercial data
systems.
  "It might do to computers what AIDS has done to sex," said Bushinsky. "The
current free flow of information will stop. Everyone will be very careful who
they come into contact with and with whom they share their information." 

    [Also noted by Gene Spafford, spaf@purdue.edu, who read it in the 
    8 Jan 88 Lafayette &lt;Indiana&gt; Journal and Courier, under the title
    "Computer virus' potential horrifies experts.]

USC uses similar card readers to control access to restricted parking areas.
Frequently, any card can be used to open them.  (They just fixed most of
them again.)  I've also heard that quarters no longer work in place of
tokens as the other way of getting in.  (The tokens are for delivery men, etc.)

In New York, Citibank's doors at their banking centers will only open
if you have a valid Citicard.  There is a noticeable delay between the
time when you insert the card and when the door buzzes open.

On the other hand, all NY banks that are a member of NYCE (New York Cash
Exchange), Cirrus, etc. have card readers in their doors that will accept
practically any card with a magnetic stripe on it.

Although the more prominent health controversy these days is indeed about
high-voltage long-distance power lines, there are also wild stories
circulating in what might be called "New Age" circles about the risks to
health posed by ordinary household AC.  The last person to lecture me on the
subject claimed that AC disrupted the body's natural "electromagnetic system,"
a system which is ignored by Western medicine but on which acupuncture is
based.  She also claimed that the problem is only found in the U.S., since in
Europe they use DC, not AC (sic!).  The solution she offered was to live in
the country in a house with minimal electrical appliances and to sleep with
your body pointing north (?) in order to be in line with the earth's
"electromagnetic fields."

I have no idea whether or not there might be some actual basis in fact for
these concerns, but the people raising them usually wrap them in such
mumbo-jumbo that it's hard to take them seriously.  This is sad, since I am a
firm believer in the possibility that there are risks which become ubiquitous
in industrial civilization before we pay them much attention.  (For instance,
can anybody tell me what my eyesight will be like when I'm sixty-five and have
been squinting at CRTs on a daily basis for 50 years?  And I expect that
future generations will scarcely believe our stupidity in dealing with toxic
and nuclear wastes and the immense quantities of plastics and other less toxic
but non-biodegradable waste which we churn out every day.)  Unfortunately the
people who raise such concerns sometimes seem to be those who will believe
*anything*.

With the frequent (and valid) complaints about how the computer is fostering
an impersonal society, it was with some interest that I read an article in
the Washington Post last week in which the Post reported that Jesse Jackson's
campaign headquarters had sent him a telex message which suggested some 
approaches which he could use in the upcoming primary campaigns.

The telex didn't go to Jackson; instead, it was delivered to the Washington
Post's telex machine.  The Post, of course, printed excerpts from it in the
article.  (There weren't any smoking pistols in the material.)

Jackson's campaign manager told the Post that it wasn't a staff error and
must have been the machine, since he (the manager) was the person who
operated the machine when the text was sent.  The article didn't say just
how the machine could have been at fault.

Even if this turns out to be a case in which the operator dialed the wrong
number, it does illustrate the problem of systems in which the routing system
uses non-obvious addressing.  An envelope addressed to "The Washington Post"
would have been easily seen as not appropriate for an internal political memo,
but an E-mail address of (202)-334-6100 isn't obviously an inappropriate one
unless you notice that 202 is not equal to 319 (D.C. vs. Iowa)...  and that
assumes that you aren't using a computer-driven telex system in which you
might not see the conversion from a nickname to a phone number.

What feedback mechanisms are (should) there be to prevent this kind of
misdelivery for electronic mail?  We've all seen the occasional red-faced
apologies on the net from sites which let test messages escape.

(I don't have the article in front of me, and may have some minor details
wrong, so no flames, please...)      Joe Morris

[Excerpted from the AP wire]

DETROIT - Michigan Bell Telephone Company took about 3 1/2 days to make up
one second.  The company's computer-operated telephone time service wasn't
adjusted at [...] midnight New Year's Eve, Greenwich Mean Time to account
for the "leap second" between 1987 and 1988.  The adjustment is needed to
synchronize the world's steadily running atomic clocks with the ever-slowing
rotation of the Earth.  But people who set watches or synchronized
activities by Michigan Bell's time signal were one second off during the
weekend.  We thought the change was automatically in the (computer's)
program.  We manually added the second" Monday morning, said a Michigan Bell
spokeswoman.

American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, reproduced without
perdition.

           Deposit Taxes by Phone:  How Easy Can It Get?

Tax practitioners are warily watching the development of a government plan to
automate the federal tax deposit system.  They're mostly in favor of getting
rid of glitches in the present system but worry that a new, computerized
method could cause added work and expense for very small businesses, some of
which would be unable to participate at all because of lack of sophistication
or even lack of such basic resources as a computer or touch telephone.

Under the present system, taxpayers remit payroll taxes, corporate taxes,
excise taxes and the like into Treasury accounts at authorized financial
depositories.  Nearly 70 percent of all government revenues are received in
this manner.

Under the new system, a taxpayer might feed the information directly into one
of Uncle Sam's computers, which would debit the taxpayer's bank account
directly.  This is another source of uneasiness among some tax practitioners
queried about preliminary plans for the new system -- IRS access to bank
accounts.

From O'Malley &amp; Gratteau INC. column, Chicago Tribune, Jan. 11, 1988:

  Just in case you were gaining confidence in the U.S. Military:  A barely
noticed July 31, 1987, report by the U.S. House Armed Services Committee on
the sale of military equipment to the Islamic Republic of Iran included this
passage: "As a result of other errors within the Army, the entire last
shipment of 500 missiles had a faulty battery that has caused a dangerous
fly-back problem."  What's a fly-back?  It means the rockets had a tendency
to dribble out of the tube, fall on the ground and then ignite.  We presume
there was a no-return policy.

Even worse, many of these locks will open if you simply stick something

does the trick on many doors.

It seems like the locks are there to inspire confidence instead of
actually protecting;  perhaps the banks feel that decent locks are
too expensive?

I found more details about my previous report.  At least some Stearns brand
PC compatibles fail at boot up in 1988.  A message "bad or missing command
interpreter" is issued, perhaps due to something in the config.sys file.

A problem on Sun machines was mentioned here, and there are reports on USENET
of another PC compatible with problems due to 1988.  Three unrelated
sensitivities to 1988 may seem like a lot, except there are now hundreds of
computer manufacturers able to cause errors.  With specialty chips in wide use,
a date-sensitive error in millions of appliances is only a matter of time.

Just when you thought its was safe to play with computers...

With all of the traffic in Risks digest dealing with Computer Viruses,
letter bombs et al, I though I'd pass this one on.  A programmer in West
Germany has posted to Compu$erve the _source_ to a simple virus that will 
run on a Macintosh computer.

I normally wouldn't even dare to mention that such a thing exists in a
"public" forum, but it's on Compuserve, so it might as well be painted on
walls coast to coast.

The author insists that it's is a very simple virus, easily defeated, 
(which it is, having looked at and understood the sources), and is posted for 
educational uses with the intent of making people aware that such things exist 
and to inspire them to write defenses against them.  

In terms of a program, it's very small, a few pages of Pascal, and maybe
50 lines of assembly code.  The installation code has a bunch of flags to 
control whether or not the virus replicates, whether it gets installed into 
the current running application, or just the system software, etc, etc. 
The actual virus is a small piece of code disguised as a resource that 
inserts itself in a system trap handler...it's alarmingly straight forward.

The author goes on to mention, in the documentation, that this virus was
inspired by a number of viruses he has encountered that did damage to his 
systems, so he wrote a virus that won't let "unknown" programs run on any of 
his company's machines.  (i.e., if the program(s) to be run aren't already 
infected with HIS virus, they won't be allowed to run at all.)

This is the first time I have ever seen sources to something like this, and it
scares me a lot. If this code is any indication, viruses in general are a snap 
to write -- an could be placed _anywhere_; even in innocent looking HyperCard
Stacks (Apple's HyperText software...) that thousands of people and User's
Groups download and give out all over the place (and most Mac users aren't 
computer professionals -- they'll never know what hit'em).

[Come to think of it, this is right out of the story _True Names_ by 
Vernor Vinge...]

[headlined] Reagan Signs Bill Governing Computer Data

President Reagan yesterday signed a bill intended to tighten security of
computer systems that store nonclassified data such as census, tax and
business records.  The National Bureau of Standards is to develop programs to
protect the machines from being illegally tapped by outsiders.

The law overrides a national security directive that Reagan issued in 1984
giving the Pentagon's National Security Agency responsibility for safe-
guarding the data.  Later, the White House created a new classification of
data for protection -- "sensitive but unclassified."

The measures led to criticism in Congress that the government was tightening
the flow of information and expanding military authority.  The new law places
responsibility for civilian computer security in civilian hands, but provides
for the NSA to give technical advice to the bureau.  The law also specifies
that nothing in it will be used to restrict disclosures under the Freedom of
Information Act.

From The Lafayette (Indiana) Journal &amp; Courier, Jan. 9th, 1988.

  INDIANAPOLIS - A failed gearbox was blamed Friday for causing the engine to
fail in the Air Force fighter jet that crashed Oct. 29 into a hotel, killing
10 people, a published report said.
  The military jet, piloted by Maj. Bruce L. Teagarden, lost its ignition
and air-fuel mixture systems when a gearbox part failed, _The Indianapolis
Star_ reported in today's editions, quoting an unreleased Air Force report
due to be released next week.

Telex service does give you a more-or-less positive feedback as to whom you've
been connected to.  It's called the "answerback code", which is sent at the
initiation of a connection and whenever you (the sender) transmit a WRU (who
are you) control character.  Each machine is give a supposedly unique (and
usually mnemonic) code when it is installed; it has a length of 8 characters
or so.

You might think a campaign manager would alert to the Washington newspaper's
answerback, but it's all too easy to overlook the code until after the message
is sent.

Telex is an odd medium, slow and fundamentally two-way, but it
is almost always used in a one-way unattended receiver mode.

Martin Ewing, Caltech

   [It used to be a relatively easy matter to break off a few tynes on
   your answer-back drum, or indeed install a different one, thus being
   able to masquerade as someone else.  Perhaps it is harder now?  
   Somehow I doubt it.  PGN]

Joe Morris asks, concerning misdelivery of E-mail due to human error,
"What feedback mechanisms are (should) there be to prevent this kind
of misdelivery for electronic mail?"  I suggest that the answer to this
question is, "None!"  There comes a point where human beings must be made
to accept the consequences of their actions and something akin to not
noticing that 202 (D.C. area code) is not equal to 319 (Iowa area code) is
decidedly one of those times.  While machines make our work faster, easier,
and more comfortable, there is probably a limit to the extent that they
should protect us from our own stupidity.  Certainly, the misaddressing of
E-mail described by Joe has passed that limit.  However, it would be
interesting for us to attempt to pin-point precisely (or at least 
approximately) where that limit is.  Any ideas out there?

Len Bliss, Appalachian State University, College of Education, Boone, NC 28608

     [One widely used notion is that of REDUNDANCY -- including check sums.
     The notion that anyone can call your home (10 digits) and with another
     single digit can (1) read your answering machine messages, (2) turn on
     your oven, (3) turn your burglar alarm on or off, (4) feed the dog, ...
     is somewhat hair-raising.  One way of making unlisted numbers much 
     harder to find by sequential dialing experiments would be to use the
     European technique of variable-length phone numbers.  You want a
     difficult number?  Get one with 20 digits.  It would also cut down
     on random wrong numbers.  PGN]

  Washington State University, like several other universities in the
area is currently planning on implementing a registration system based
on touch tone phones. The student dials the computer, and when connected
"dials" his/her ID number, followed by a five-digit number associated with
specific classes. The computer will either sign a person up, or inform the
caller that the class is full.
  The ID numbers are eight digits long, which would give some protection
against someone using someone else's number. The only problem is that on
the local IBM mainframe (under VM/CMS), student userid's are the ID
numbers, and there are some pretty huge NAMES files floating around.
  The potential for abuse is there, especially considering that one could
use dial-out modems on the system.....

After my submission the other week about American Express losing my PIN,
I just thought you might like to know that things don't appear to have
ended there.  I used the card to withdraw some cash shortly afterwards
while on holiday in Scotland, and have received two (so far) notifications of
intent to debit the requisite amount from my bank account.

I called Customer Service and spoke to a Representative who assured me
that I would only be debited once; we'll see.  A few questions revealed
that: this duplication had been happening to many Cardmembers using the
Express Cash service; that he didn't think there was a link to those who
had recently lost their PINs (although it hadn't occured to him); and
that he seemed unsure about whether this would be the last problem I
would encounter.

I'm sure all this malarkey is doing Amex's reputation no end of bad;
I'll let you know of any future developments.

A guy I used to work with here who previously worked at Sperry-Univac (now
UniSys) claimed to have inserted a good joke into one of their intelligent
terminals buried deep in the microcode where no one is likely to accidentally
find it.  I don't know all of the details about the intelligent terminal, but
it could have had PC-compatibility as one of its intelligent features.

Anyway, when the terminal is first powered on, it checks to see if the current
year according to the battery-powered clock is different from the one saved
the last time it was turned off.  If so, it displays a New Year's message and
plays "Auld Lang Syne" for about a minute using the tone generator normally
reserved for the bell.  It is then supposed to work normally for the rest of
the year.  He said he gets a good laugh every new year just thinking about it.

That company does start with "S" as the first article mentioned (at least it
did when it sold the terminal).  I suppose there is a chance that this
"harmless prank" could become not so harmless after a few years.

Oh, and by the way, this guy now works for the other "S" company
mentioned above.  Just a thought...

The following appeared in Datalink, dated Monday, January 11,1988.

  James McMahon, the contract systems programmer accused of planting
  "logic bombs" in his client's computer systems, has been cleared of
  all charges.

  McMahon walked free from Isleworth Crown Court, London, late last
  month after the presiding judge Derek Holden accepted a
  mid-trial motion that the evidence against McMahon was inconsistent,
  incomplete and laking in reliability.

  The ruling, which focused on print-out and disk exhibits, promises to
  be a watershed in the history of computer law, influencing the
  validity of such admissions in future cases.

  The trial was billed as the UK's first "logic bomb" case, with McMahon
  accused of planting unauthorised code in the DEC PDP 11 system
  software of air freight forwarder Pandair Freight. The prosection
  claimed that one such "lofic bomb" locked terminals at Pandair's
  Heston office, near Heathrow, and a second was set to wipe the memory
  of the company's Birmingham computer.

  McMahon's motive was either financial gain or revenge after losing a
  50,000 pound contract with Pandair, the prosecution said.

  The judge ruled that the evidence wasn't solid enough and instructed
  the jury to pronounce McMahon not quilty. A relieved McMahon told
  Datalink: "I have lost much more than Pandair ever did."

  McMahon, who was referred to during the case as a Posche or
  Lamborghini driving philanderer, says he bears no resentment. His only
  gripe is that he lost a major contract worth 40,000 pounds with the
  Stock Exchange after police informed directors there that there was a
  case pending.

  McMahon has now returened full-time to DEC system consultancy in the
  City.

In a second article in the same paper the following appeared...

  Eighteen months of bing labelled a "logic bomber" finally ended for
  system programmer James McMahon late last month.

  McMahon was found not quilty of planting three so-called logic bombs
  in the screen handling module of his client's DEC PDP 11 system
  software.

  The client, air freight forwarder Pandair, employed him on a freelance
  basic to patch its system software and install or tune its operating
  system, in this case the RSX 11 M+ operating system.

  As well as maintaining his innocence throughout, McMahon is adamant
  that the code that constituted the alleged bombs could never have
  produced the effect the prosecution claimed. In short he claims he was
  framed, that the code was written to discredit him.

  As his barrister, Colin Nicholls, QC, put it in court: "The
  prosecution evidence is partial, deceptive and manufactured. It smells
  of dishonesty and contrivance."

  The judge thought this submission well-founded, agreeing that there
  were areas of unsatisfactory and missing evidence.

  First, the original disks containing the supposed bomb were not taken
  into police custody immediately after the suspected sabotage, but left
  in the Pandair computer room.

  The Pandair programmer who produced the printout of file directories
  and source listings from the disks had sufficient skills in Macro
  Assembler to insert the bombs the judge said.

  Further the Pandair development disk went missing shortly after the
  alleged crime.

  "There is doubt over who produced the printout and which disks it came
  from," he said.

  And the motive for framing McMahon was there, claimed Nicholls:
  jealousy over a shared lover and envy over McMahon's expensive
  lifestyle.

  However, after five weeks the judge was unwilling for the case to
  continue with such gaps and doubts over the evidence. "we need to take
  a particularly robust view of evidence in such a complex technical
  case," he said.

  The relief on the faces of the 12 men and women of the jury as they
  were dismissed testified to that.

  The abuse of the SSN was forseen long ago by none other than then-FBI-
director J. Edgar Hoover.  His warning was against two things that would
reduce U.S.A. to a Police State: a national identification card, and a
national police force.  His warning was heard loudly enough that for many
years the SSN card that you recieved from the government had a notice on the
back "this card is not legal for identification purposes."
  I recently tried an experiment: I tried to go for one month without giving
my SSN to anyone.  I found it impossible to manitain a reasonably civilized
life-style under that circumstance.  For example:  I could not write a

I could not get a post-office box: positive ID (driver's license or state ID

I work in a public library, and I can assure comp.risks readers that most
libraries and librarians are very conscious of the privacy issue when it
comes to records about library users.

The best example is how our automated circulation systems are designed to
work.  We will be using CLSI, Inc., the largest vendor to libraries, and I
think they are a good example of the care taken to protect the rights of a
book borrower's privacy.  When you check out a book a link is established
between the barcode number on your library card and the barcode in the
borrowed item.  As soon as you bring the book back, that link is broken and
no record of the transaction is archived.  You can opt not to even be able
to see the current unbroken links unless items are overdue.

This means that no one in the library or legal or mental health system can
get a profile of your reading habits from checking old records.  There are
just not any--except overdue items, and they are kept until you pay up and
clear your record.

That is reassuring, but I am troubled that some libraries ask for SSN as a
unique id before they issue a library card.  Our committee on registering
library users quickly decided against this, again because of privacy matters.
I would urge any of you who use a library to inquire about this and post some
responses here.  Our unique id will be first letter of first name, first four
letters of last name, month (1-9,O,N,D) and two digits of the year.  Mine
would be SCISL042. There is some way they handle all the John Smith in one
big area, but this works quite well for most cities and counties.

"The Consultant" by John McNeil (c) 1978 
First published in Great Britain in 1978 by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Limited
1983 edition published by Century Publishing Co. Ltd.
        76 Old Compton Street, London W1V 5PA
ISBN 0 7126 0174 0

This is a novel relevant to the concerns of RISKS that I don't think
has been discussed here before.  (On its own, it's quite a competent
crime thriller, the best computer crime fiction I've read--a real
late-night page-turner.)

The central theme of "The Consultant" is computer fraud.  The protagonist
is a computer consultant who specializes in discovering embezzlement
and fraud.  His clients know that he is good at finding it.  What
they don't know is that after he exposes a culprit he quietly takes
over the security loophole for his own use.

Since most of the characters in the book are not computer sophisticates,
most of the explanations are given in simple terms, but McNeil does
not talk down to the reader, and does not spout technical nonsense.
He manages, in quite a readable way, to present many of the basic
precautions against computer fraud, and explain both why they are
necessary and why they are not sufficient.

Anyone familiar with the state of the art ten years ago should spot
some reasons why the precise fiddle described in the book would not
have succeeded.  (Perhaps some details were changed to protect the
guilty?)  But any hotshot programmer reading the book will probably
come up with a scheme that he believes WOULD have worked; I fear that
some of them will be correct about this.

RISKS readers will realize that the situation has gotten worse in
the last decade.  There is vastly more (and more valuable) information
in computer systems.  The systems themselves have gotten more complex,
making "weevils," as well as bugs, harder to locate and remove.  Computer
networks have information and code sloshing around in ways that are
much harder to audit.  It is steadily easier to turn bits into cash.
And the technology of security for information systems doesn't seem
to be keeping up.

This is a good book to give your manager or vice-president when you
want to dampen unwarranted optimism about the safety of data in an
existing or planned information system.  He will almost certainly
come away convinced that it is unwise to trust the system without
repeated security audits--and that it is foolhardy to trust your
auditors!

On the other hand, if you want to INDUCE unwarranted optimism, you
may be pleased to know that this book doesn't seem to have a very
wide circulation in the US.  Brian Randell had told me about it some
time ago, but I was unable to find it in any local bookstores.  I
am grateful to him for mailing me a copy from England.

The cover says that this is "The novel on which the 4-part BBC TV Series was
based," and states that Hywel Bennet played Christopher Webb in "the BBCtv
production of THE CONSULTANT, produced by Ron Craddock, directed by Cyril
Coke and adapted by Alan Plater."  Does anyone know if this series played on
public TV in the US?  I don't recall hearing about it.

Three men, one of them an employee of the bank, tried to steal 15.1 million
dollar from an Amsterdam bank. The employee booked at the 24th of December
$8M4 &amp; $6M7 to a swiss Bank account in Zuerich opened by the other two
persons. Normally such a transaction requires two passwords from two
persons.  Somehow the employee managed to get the password of somebody else.
Due to a technical failure the second transaction didn't work and warnings
popped up on other peoples' screens that a transaction failed.  These people
alarmed their bosses, since the transaction was nowhere scheduled.  Also the
police and the Swiss bank were warned, which disabled the accounts.  The
three men tried the same day to collect $5M. When they heard the account
was disabled, they fled. Their identity was known by that time.  They turned
themself in the 4th of January.

&gt;    Somehow I doubt it.  PGN]

It's getting easier all the time. In the days of mechanical teletypes tampering
with the answerback drum could be detected, but now most teletypes have the
answerback message stored in ROM. A hacker/criminal can easily change this
message, and pose as somebody else.  (The answerback drum is also used for the
HERE-IS message, a voluntary identification.)  The current trend of using PC's
as intelligent telex terminals makes this tampering even easier. The answerback
function really should be implemented by the switching system, not by the user
terminal.

From: Steve Caine &lt;shc@cfg.com&gt;

Spoofing a telex answerback is even easier than in the days of the KSR 33 and
its answerback drum.

Our telex "machine" is just a port and a couple of programs on our VAX.
To send a telex, we call our IRC (International Record Carrier) who
transmits a WRU (^E).  If we respond with our answerback, that's it.  We
can enter the number we want, the connection is made, and we have a 2-way,
real-time conversation.  In practice, of course, we just send our message
but we prefix &amp; suffix it with a WRU so we can be "sure" we have reached
the correct number.

When someone calls our telex number, the IRC switcher dials the telephone
number they have on file for us, our machine answers and responds to the IRC's
WRU with our answerback.  If it matches what the IRC expects, their switcher
make the connection between us &amp; the caller.  Our program just collects up the
message &amp; then mails it to a couple of standard mailboxes on our system.

Note that it is trivial to spoof the answerback.  In our program, it is just a
file (/usr/spool/telex/ANSWERBACK).  Also, the answerback is in no sense a
password.  It's at the bottom of every sheet of our letterhead, for example,
and it appears in all the published telex directories.

In most of the world, a printed telex message with an exchange of answerbacks
at the start and the end is a legal proof that the message was sent AND
received.

From: Brent Chapman &lt;chapman%mica.Berkeley.EDU@violet.berkeley.edu&gt;

The recent, unrelated articles in Risks about (mis)use of Touch-Tone
technology and lack of recognizeable answerback (the Jesse Jackson Telex
to the Washington Post) brought to mind a similar problem that I face
several times each week. 

I run the computer facilities of Capital Market Technology, a finance company
in Berkeley.  We deal in foreign exchange risk management, so our operation has
some around-the-clock aspects to it (although most of our work is done during
normal West Coast business hours).  Part of my job is being on-call at all
times to deal quickly with system problems; I carry a pager with a 10-digit LCD
on the top.  To reach me, someone dials the phone number assigned to my pager,
then punches in the numeric message (usually a phone number or a code) that
they want to appear on my pager LCD.

The problem is, the pager controller answers with a simple series of beeps,
prompting the caller to enter the message.  The caller gets no indication of
_whose_ pager they've reached.  In the six months I've had the pager, my
company has used it exactly once, yet it goes off several times each week
(often in the middle of the night)!), apparently because of people dialing the
wrong number, Sometimes, I'll get several calls per day for a few days in a
row; I'm convinced that people are programming the wrong number (mine!) into
their phone memories, and keep dialing that and wonder why the person they
_think_ they are paging isn't answering calling back.

If everyone just punched in their phone number as the "message", it might not
be so bad.  Life isn't so simple, however.  First, even those that _do_ enter
their phone number as the message usually don't bother to enter their area
code; the service area of our paging company covers all or part of 4 different
Bay Area area codes (415, 408, 916, and 704), plus the Phoenix/Tucson and Los
Angeles/San Diego areas.  Second, people (including my company) often use
private codes.  Third, the paging company also provides non-message (beep-only)
pagers; if someone calls my pager number, but doesn't enter a message, my pager
still goes off (displaying a special "no message" code).

I've gotten to the point that if it goes and the message isn't in our company
code, or if it isn't a phone number that I recognize, I ignore it.  Sometimes,
if it goes off a series of times in the middle of the night, I'm forced to turn
it off just so that I can get some sleep, and risk missing a "real" call from
my company (although they can still call my home number).

It seems to me that a lot of my problems with the system would disappear if the
controller answered with a recorded or syntheszed message ("Please enter your
message for Brent Chapman of Capital Market Technology at the tone.") rather
than the series of beeps it uses now.

Re: Suns lose track of time after New Years

The Sun problem involved the clock chip being improperly accessed,
and time drifting as a result.  As I understand it, this is really
a double bug, because improper input makes the clock chip go 
bonkers.  Thus, a bug in software tickles a bug in hardware.

Re: viruses and buried jokes

During college I worked at Sun Electric, which makes automated testers
for cars.  A friend wrote the firmware for an emissions tester that would
printed time-stamped reports.  For some reason, on power-up the date was 
initialized to his birthday.

I understand that video game programmmers often insert "signatures" into
their games.

An unnamed state university in MD takes your SSN and adds a digit to it (a 1),
therefore they say it isn't you SSN.  ("SSN's are 9 digits, you student id is
10 digits).  Another unnamed state university in VA is very careful to do the
same thing but call it you student id.  Only if pressed (What is my student id?
 "It's on your student id card"  "But I don't have one of those" ...) do they
say SSN.

Steve Cisler mentions that most libraries and librarians are very conscious
of the privacy issue when it comes to records about library users.  He
explained how their system made and broke links and kept no audit trails of
past links when they were broken upon book return.

But, what about backup's?  Does the library system do monthly, weekly,
daily, hourly (like MIT-Multics used to) or real-time file mirroring of book
borrowing information?  how long are the backup tapes/disks kept before
being recycled?  Stored off site, etc.?

As was discovered (on a hunch) in the National Security Council office
automation system (PROFS), backup's played a key role in the Iran-Contra
investigation of Oliver North &amp; John Poindexter.

Interesting comment there; glad you posted it. However, does this mean that
the library then has no way of tracing back the chain of patrons who checked
out a book to find out who might have damaged it, so they can be charged for
this? For example, just a couple weeks ago, I checked out and read a book
from the St. Louis Public Library (which uses a bar-code-scan system now;
they used to take pictures of the library card and the data pasted inside the
book's front cover). I discovered that a page had been torn in half near the
end of the book. Is there no way for the library to query the patron(s) who
had checked out this book before me, to see if any of them would own up to
damaging it?

No, there is no way to query patrons who may have borrowed a book before you
did.  We take the stance that it is better to lose some control and protect
privacy.  In some cases we catch the damage before shelving the book and
note that in the front cover "Damage noted 1/14/88" etc.  Steve

The discussion of the pros and cons of having to reveal your SSN in the USA
is rather interesting.  The UK has virtually no national register of people
(officially).  You legally have to register births, deaths and marriages and
in principle you have to be on the electoral roll (although the take-up rate
of this is reputed to be less than 70 percent in some inner-city areas).
There is no national identification number or card (not even drivers
licenses.  When I was in California someone told me there were non-driving
driving permits for the blind to act as ID).

This all seems similar to the USA.  Yet I rarely have to produce my social
security number (for supplementary benefit, to request a tax code and for my
employer to pay my NI contributions).  Libraries want a proof of ID, but
anything will do.  Each body uses a distinct magic number for people --- I
have a Social Security Number, an NHS number, a Tax Reference, a Driver Number.

I wonder why the USA has got its systems hung up on one ID number.  Here
SSNs are used solely for Social Security, Driver Numbers for driving etc.  I
have never yet seen a form related to anything other than a number's own
domain requesting one.  Do Americans need to quote an SSN for a passport?  A
credit card?  A mortgage?  Why is a country with so many liberal tendencies
allowing itself to make the job of repressive law-making easier?

From Information Week, March 7, 1988, p. 8:

First Boston has confirmed that the company faces a substantial loss due to
inaccuracies in its system that inventories mortgage-backed securities.  The
company won't comment on the cause of the inventory error until an internal
audit is completed, but it's expected that losses will range between $10
million and $50 million.

Here is another entry on the danger of relying on the machine answer.

I have a friend who works at Inland Steel.  They control many of their furnaces
with special digital controllers made in the 60's.  They then have these
controllers hooked up to pdp-11 computers in a network to manage production and
quality control.  The 11's are responsible for lot tracking and special orders
while the controllers are charged with carrying out the production.  During a 2
week down spell one of the annealing furnaces was shut-down for repairs and was
allowed to cool.  (Usually furnaces are left idling even when not in
production) When it was ready to return to production a true cold start was
down to the furnace and it's controller.  At power up, a power supply burned
out in the digital thermometer so that it registered 0F.  The controller
knowing that it was in a cold start ordered 100% power to the gas tubes.  The
furnace should reach operating temperature within 1 hr, but with the dead
thermometer was registering no increase so the controller just waited for 4
hrs.  In the time period the furnace burned itself out doing several hundred
thousand dollars damage and will be out of service 6 - 12 months.  The amazing
thing was that 4 workers were there supervising the cold start and all of them
watched this knowing the computer was in control and must know what it was
doing even though their experience told them otherwise.

I see a few faults here in design.

     1) having a single fault failure path in the controller.

     2) the controller not having logic to recognize temp rise
        must occur rapidly in response to firing the burners.

     3) blind reliance on technology by skilled workers.

     4) no safety mechanisms external to the conttroller to recognize a
        runaway condition.

     5) No computer polling of sensors to test them response (self-test)

Having read the discussion on number plate "mismatches", I would like to submit
the following.   Espen Andersen    Compuserve: 71361,3425    EDB85007 at NOBIVM

From NUTWORKS (The Electronic Humor Magazine) Issue No 13,
Submitted by Niels Kristian Jensen (C83821@NEUVM1.BITNET).

                              The plate.
                              =========

In the U.S. it is possible to buy a 7-character "personalized" license
plate describing the car or the owner.  To apply, one must list 3
choices in order of preference.  If one's first choice has already
been assigned to another driver, one gets one's second choice, etc.
These facts and a computer system made the following possible:

Mr. X wanted a new plate.  He got the form and filled in his first two
preferences.  If these two possibilities had already been assigned to
someone else, Mr. X didn't want a personalized plate at all, so for
his third choice he wrote "NOPLATE".

           He got "NOPLATE" as his new personalized plate.

At first he got mad, but he mounted it on his car anyway.  Within a
week he had received offers for over 100 dollars for this ingenius
plate, and he began to grow partial to it.  In fact, he liked it.

His feelings changed by the end of the month, however, because by then
Mr. X had recieved nearly a hundred parking tickets.  Why?  Well, any
time a police officer spots a car missing a licence plate, he or she
will write "NOPLATE" on the ticket/citation.

The computer matched every single one of these with... Mr. X.

The computer program couldn't be changed, but the ways of the parking
guards could.  So don't *EVER* order the custom plate: "NONE".

(It would make you Mr. X the second)

    [This is an old warhorse.  I couldn't find it in my archives, 
    but I am sure it has been either in an early SEN or in RISKS.  
    On the other hand, recycling is big in California as well as
    vanity plates.  PGN]

It seems you have been bitten by a virus whose sources were uploaded to Compu-
serve sevral months ago...  The author, a fellow in West Germany, thought it
would be educational to distribute these example viruses in source form to
encourage people to write defenses against them.  His stated intent in writing
a virus in the first place was to keep people from running possibly virus
ridden program on their production Macintoshes which had been previously hit
by viruses....  its signature, in the orignal sources, was a resource type of
nVir... its a simple yet potent virus and very easily modified to do bad things.

	... unfortunately the only way around most of these viruses is to
replace your system folder. (Make sure you do this from a WRITE-LOCKED 
copy of the Apple System installer... or else you'll end up back where you
started, with an infected system.... there is another problems, that being
that the virus  that was on CompuServe knows how to infect APPLICATIONS, as
well as the system itself.  Pretty depressing....

From: "hugh_davies.WGC1RX"@Xerox.COM

In RISKS 6.35, Nancy Leveson &lt;nancy%murphy.ics.uci.edu@ROME.ICS.UCI.EDU&gt; says;

  "It describes several serious incidents that occurred because pilots put too
  much confidence in automatic control systems, even to the extent of rejecting
  their own external evidence that the system was wrong"

I don't know about commercial pilot training, but I do know about PPL (Private
Pilots License) training, and I have read about military training, and when
learning to fly you are taught to ignore the 'evidence of your own eyes' and to
rely on instruments in all but the most ludicrous of circumstances.

Obviously this has the risk that the instruments may be wrong, but there are
many instances of pilots ignoring the instruments and relying on their senses
and subsequently doing stupid (or lethal) things. There is at least one
documented case of aircrew flying at night over water, seeing the lights of
fishing boats and believing them to be stars, inverting their aircraft, in
direct contradiction to what their instrumentation was telling them.  There is
also a fairly common phenomenon called 'the leans' when the pilot develops a
pronounced impression that the aircraft is not level, and rolls it in the
opposite direction to correct, even when the artificial horizon and the
subsequent handling of the aircraft tell him that the original roll was
non-existent.

In most cases, the (computer) user is not told to believe absolutely the
evidence of a machine over the evidence of his senses. But in the case of
aircraft he is explicitly trained to do so. This behooves us (as programmers,
etc.) to make sure that the machine is telling the truth!

I had something similar happen about two years ago.  I made a $60 dollar
withdrawal, but the machine only gave me $40;  my receipt indicated $60.
When I went to the office next day to report it, the teller called over
a manager type.  Turns out they had been puzzling all morning over the
discrepancy in their records, which they reconcile daily, and were only
too happy to give me my $20.

It is important for *both* ends of a transaction to keep records.

Regarding waning arithmetic skills:

Like pilots of high-tech planes who need to be able to tell when to observe
warning devices and when to override them, people using calculators need to
know when to trust the answers.  Even perfectly working calculators are
subject to input errors, and the consequences of a mistake can range from
inconsequential to disastrous.

To take a small example, once I was buying several different items at a drug
store.  The cashier keyed them in, and announced the total as $2.45.  This
was surprising to me, since the price of one of the items was $3.00
(apparently entered as $0.30).  Errors like this must happen frequently, but
this was so glaring it should have been noticed.

A case appropriate to this time of year:

It can be VERY important that adjusted gross income multiplied by 
tax rate (among other calculations) come out correctly.


Regarding the risks of erroneous large phone bills:

They occur infrequently, and they are normally fairly easy to correct, but
(with even lower probability), one COULD result in phone service being cut
off, just when there is a need to make an emergency call (fire, medical,
police).  Then the cost goes way up, as the reversibility goes way down.

A cousin of mine is a police officer.  He is not at all computer-knowledgable,
but he understands very well that computers can make mistakes.  Why?  Because
of an exercise his class did when he was training.  Each member of the class
was given a calculator and told to do some specific arithmetic with it.  As it
turned out, half the calculators were (intentionally) defective, giving wrong
answers--but the class was not told this ahead of time; they had to find it out
the hard way.

I think this is a great idea.  It ought to be mandatory for people in every
profession in which non-computer-knowledgable people interact with computers
(especially government bureaucrats).  If my cousin is any indication, the
lesson will last a lifetime.

      True, I haven't seen that... but the original article mentioned an error
      due to a calculator with digits failing. I only wanted to point out
      that it there ARE groups (HP) that don't ignore the problem entirely.  

      The HP-41c automatically sanity checks the memory... I have not heard
      of any that actually check the numbers they generate, though

Can anyone point me to some good references on closed-cycle or
partly-open-cycle ecologies &amp; economies?  I'm particularly interested 
in such questions as the minimal population and skill sets needed to 
construct something close to current US middle-class lifestyles.

Work on self-replicating factories might be of peripheral interest.  Earth
and space are both interesting, and probably have very different answers.

"Living off the land" as a 19th-century trapper or 20th-century bag lady is not
nearly as interesting as the more general problem of bootstrapping an economy.
Now perhaps I'm getting into third-world development issues.

Whoops, I'd better tie this into RISKS.  As the parts lose their grasp of the
whole (shared knowledge and values) and people become more specialized, I
suspect that more and more types of catastrophic breakdowns of civilization are
possible.  Mark Vonder Haar's comment about lost knowledge of farming is right
on.  Let us further consider that the agricultural 5% of the US don't "feed
themselves" -- they take out big loans, buy big machines, fuel, fertilizer,
COMPUTERS, and pesticides, and run specialized agri-factories.

In RISKS 6.36, Matt Fichtenbaum (mlf@genrad.com) mentioned a cross correlation
between the databases of New York State's drivers' licenses and recipients of
aid to the blind.

The RISK is what is done with such a cross correlation, not that it was done
at all.  California allows drivers with clean driving records to renew their
licenses by mail.  I know one elderly individual (and have read of two others)
who continued to renew their licenses after attaining legal blindness, for
identification purposes.  The RISK is that people (eg, "The Bureaucracy")
might automatically prosecute such people without finding out what's really
going on.

   [For those who missed it, there was a terrific flurry of news on this 
   subject in the press throughout the week.  Here are two of the highlights.
   I have not tried to edit out the redundancy in the Pittsburgh article
   that follows.]  

04-17-88 2103 EDT
WEST GERMAN SECRETLY GAINS ACCESS TO U.S. MILITARY COMPUTERS
By JOHN MARKOFF
c.1988 N.Y. Times News Service
    
    NEW YORK - For almost two years, a West German citizen used global
communications networks to secretly gain access to more than 30
computers belonging to the United States military and military
contractors, according to computer security experts.
    The intruder, whose identity and motives remain uncertain,
methodically searched for data related to nuclear weapons, intelligence
satellites, the Strategic Defense Initiative, the space shuttle, and
the North American Air Defense Command. The computer security experts
said that the intruder did not gain access to any classified
information, nor did he successfully break into what government
officials call a ''secure'' government computer where classified
information was stored.
    The computer security experts are alarmed because of the systematic
and widespread nature of the break-ins. They said there was evidence
that the West German intruder had tried to gain access to a total of
450 computers.
    The episode raises the possibility that the intruder may have been
able to assemble classified data by piecing together material that was
sensitive but unclassified. The Reagan administration has been
concerned that foreign intelligence agents could piece together
classified information by assembling a ''mosaic'' of computerized data.
    ''This kind of penetration could clearly have been used for
espionage,'' said Peter G. Neumann, a computer security expert who is
familiar with the case. He works at SRI International, a non-profit
research center in Menlo Park, Calif.
    ''I think most of the attacks before this have been relatively benign
on a global scale,'' Neumann said. ''This one is much more insidious.''
    A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington
confirmed on Sunday that the intrusions were investigated, but he
declined to comment further.
    Last week, an article in a West German weekly magazine, Quick,
detailed the case, identifying the intruder as Mathias Speer, 24, a
computer science student in the city of Hanover. FBI officials,
however, would not confirm the identity.
    The intrusions may have occurred for as long as a year before being
discovered by computer managers at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, in
Berkeley, Calif., one of the United States' national research
laboratories. The laboratory, the site of broad-based unclassified
scientific research, is a sister to the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory,
in nearby Livermore, which is heavily involved in research on secret
nuclear weapons and the Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI. The
laboratories are operated by the University of California for the
federal government.
    Rather than taking steps to deny further computer access to the
intruder, the Lawrence Berkeley security experts - working with other
government computer security personnel - organized a system to monitor
the intrusions. At one point, to trace the intruder, the Lawrence
Berkeley officials offered false but seemingly classified information
as part of an electronic sting operation. The intruder loaded that
information into his computer in West Germany, staying on line long
enough for authorities in the United States and West Germany to trace
him. Later, as part of the same operation, an apparent accomplice based
in the United States appeared to become involved.
    The identity of the American citizen was not divulged by the Lawrence
Berkeley officials or by the FBI. He is believed to have been
questioned by the FBI in June 1987, about the same time that the West
German was detained and questioned by authorities there. The electronic
break-ins ended about the same time.
    ''We knew the key words he was looking for when he read electronic
mail on our computers,'' said Dr. Clifford Stoll, the computer systems
manager at Lawrence Berkeley who initially discovered the break-ins in
August 1986 and monitored them for approximately 12 months. ''He
searched all of the files at LBL for the word 'nuclear.' Then he
started looking for 'Star Wars' and SDI. We realized that he had us
confused with Lawrence Livermore.''
    Not long after the intrusions were discovered, the Lawrence Berkeley
computer managers considered that the intrusions might be a prank,
perpetrated by a sophisticated computer enthusiast, or ''hacker.''
Stoll said that, after watching the intrusions for several months, he
became convinced that they were more than that.
    The break-ins parallel another set of incidents last year in which a
group of West German computer enthusiasts, called the Chaos Computer
Club, broke into several international computer networks of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and rummaged freely among
the data for at least three months before being discovered. However,
the computer managers at Lawrence Berkeley said they believed that the
West German intruder was not associated with the Chaos group.
    Stoll, who is also an astronomer, has written an article about the
incident that is scheduled for publication next month in the technical
journal Communications of the Association of Computing Machinery.
Lawrence Berkeley has also scheduled a news conference on Tuesday to
discuss the intrusions.
    According to the Lawrence Berkeley officials, the yearlong
investigation involved the FBI and security experts from the Air Force
and the Army, as well as private security investigators. Under West
German law, not enough evidence was obtained for prosecution, the
Lawrence Berkeley officials said.
    According to Stoll, the West German compromised the military computers
by taking advantage of security loopholes in several different
operating systems, the software programs that manage data in a
computer. On computers operating under the Unix system, he frequently
used a loophole to give himself ''superuser'' status, which allowed him
to read and alter all material stored in the computer.
    The intrusions involved a variety of U.S. military computer systems in
this country, Europe, and Japan. The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
became a starting point for connecting to two unclassified military
networks, known as Milnet and Arpanet. They link computers at military
bases and military contractors.
    At one computer at the Naval Coastal Systems Command, in Panama City,
Fla., the intruder transferred to a computer in West Germany an
encyrpted file containing user passwords. The intruder broke some of
the codes and called back to search through files protected by the
passwords. The intruder also gained acess to computers at the Army's
Fort Buckner base in Japan and at the Anniston Army Depot, a supply
base for the Army's Redstone Arsenal, in Huntsville, Ala.
    At the Air Force Systems Command, in El Segundo, Calif., the intruder
managed to attain the status of system manager. ''I watched as he
scanned all of their SDI references and the usual pile of things and
then started printing out information on the space shuttle,'' said
Stoll. ''The Air Force later told me it was not classifed information.''
    Other systems entered included military computers in San Diego, the
Pentagon's Optimus data base, and a computer at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, in Pasadena, Calif.
    The officials at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory said that they
monitored attempted intrusions into a total of 450 military computers.
    ''Basically, he was walking down the street twisting the doorknob of
each house,'' Stoll said. ''He wouldn't push hard, but then he would go
around and do the electronic equivalent of trying the back door and the
side windows. If they didn't budge, he would go to the next house on
the street.''
    Shortly after discovering the intrusions, Stoll, aided first by City
of Berkeley officials and later by federal law-enforcement officers,
began trying to trace their origin. They were traced to a computer at a
U.S. military contractor in McLean, Va., near Washington. The Lawrence
Berkeley officials declined to identify the company.
    They then discovered that the intruder was dialing from Hanover to a
university computer in Bremen, West Germany. That computer was used to
connect to machines in the United States.
    The intruder's location was masked by dialing into the military
contractor's computer in Virginia and then using that computer's
capability to call other computers around the country, including those
at Lawrence Berkeley. The Lawrence Berkeley computer was used to
connect to the military networks - Arpanet and Milnet - to gain access
to the military installations.
    In tracing the intruder, the security investigators created an
automatic alarm system. Stoll wrote a computer program that would dial
his pager whenever the West German gained access to the computer at
Lawrence Berkeley. The pager automatically called a security official
from the Tymnet McDonnell-Douglas Network Systems Co., a computer
network company based in San Jose, Calif. The Tymnet official then
notified West German law enforcement officials.
    But the investigators traced the calls back to Hanover, where it took
as long as 30 minutes to set up a trace because of antiquated
equipment. The intruder's calls generally lasted no longer than five
minutes.
    In January of 1987, the security managers at Lawrence Berkeley created
an electronic sting operation using a large file of fictitious,
seemingly secret information. The file contained a reference to an
address at the Berkeley laboratory where further information related to
the Strategic Defense Initiative could be obtained.
    Once the file was discovered, the intruder remained connected to the
Lawrence Berkeley computer for more than an hour. Three months later,
according to the Lawrence Berkeley officials, a letter was mailed from
a United States citizen living in the Northeast to the address given by
the lab, inquiring about the false SDI information.
    The letter was given to the FBI.

SOUTH PARK MAN CAUGHT IN U.S. TRAP LEAVES TRAIL CLOUDED IN MYSTERY

A South Park man who was stung seeking bogus computer-stored information
about U.S. military secrets has a long history of mysterious associations,
ranging from foreign intrigue to local garbage.

As with past incidents, authorities don't know -- or won't say --
what Laszlo J. Balogh was up to this time when his name surfaced in a
sting that caught a West German computer hacker who repeatedly gained
access to classified military files.

As with past exploits, Balogh, 43, emerged again as part-clever and
part-klutzy.

Although he has claimed extensive foreign government contacts and driven
expensive foreign cars, he once testified that he had difficulty recording an
undercover conversation for the FBI because the recorder kept slipping beneath
his sweat suit.

In the past, Balogh has billed himself as a Hungarian refugee; a draftsman; a
credit corporation employee; a trucking company owner; a diamond dealer; a
world traveler; a bodyguard for Kuwaiti princesses; a CIA hit man; and an FBI
informant.

But longtime neighbors on Ventura Drive said they had no clear picture of
Balogh's activities because he is "quiet," "keeps to himself" and is "often
gone for weeks at a time."

...Balogh in 1978 was an officer in a now-defunct company when another company
official was accused of giving Penn Hills officials a forged check drawn on a
non-existent bank.  The check was to be used as security in an unsuccessful
effort to obtain a garbage-hauling contract.  ... Balogh also was involved in a
Pittsburgh trucking firm that filed for bankruptcy in 1980.

His name surfaced again last week in connection with Marcus Hess, identified by
The San Francisco Examiner as the West German computer student who broke access
codes to snoop in to U.S. military files a half-world away in Berkeley, Calif.

Earlier, a West German weekly magazine, Quick, identified the computer intruder
as Mathias Speer, 24.  Clifford Stoll, a researcher at the Berkeley Laboratory
and Leroy Kerth, a Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory director who oversaw the
investigation, said that name may have been a pseudonym.

In this case, Balogh, in what investigators believe was an attempt to get more
information about confidential military files, took the bait investigators
dangled in the hopes of learning who was gaining illegal access to the computer
system.

Having discovered that an intruder had been reading their computer records,
officials at the U. S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
planted a fictitious file to bait the hacker's interest.

The purpose was to keep the hacker on the line long enough for authorities to
trace his phone call.  The hacker tapped into the coputer using a telephone and
computer modem.  In the event that the call coudln't be traced, authorities
also included in the fictitious file an address for the snooper to write for
additional information.

Berkeley officials thought they had solved their security problem in January
1987, when West German officials were able to trace the phone call to a
computer student in Hanover.

They were surprised four months later when they received a letter from Balogh,
who requested the information offered in the fictitious file.

...Although caught, the West German student has not been charged with
any crime.  The extent of Balogh's involvement has not been revealed.

The FBI isn't saying what, if anything, it knows about Balogh, who in
1983 served them as an informant and government witness.

[More about Balogh's involvement in schemes to steal $38,000 in
diamonds, secure garbage-hauling contracts with a phony check, and
steal computer equipment to sell to the Soviets.]

I have heard Mr. Stoll talk several times on the "Phantom of the ARPANET"
[<A HREF="/Risks/6.63.html">RISKS-6.63</A>] and the lessons learned by LBL.  One point he made with great
elan (at the last NCSC/NBS Nat'l Computer Security Conference) was that it
is essential to write actions and responses down in a 'laboratory' book.
However, it is quite obvious (as he has found out) that there are RISKs to
doing so!

Welcome to Volume 7!  There have been 472 RISKS issues in the past 35 months.
However, the number of contributions has been expanding dramatically of late
as RISKS goes further out into the internet.  (I note the big increase in
messages from Australia!)  (Countering that somewhat is the appearance of
specialized groups, such as VIRUS-L.)  To prevent RISKS readers from being
totally inundated with the deluge, the proportion of messages emerging from
my pipeline has been dwindling somewhat of late -- as I sharpen my
interpretation of the above guidelines.  (Apologies to those of you who did
not get any response at all -- if you feel that your contribution was of
PARTICULARLY BURNING INTEREST and that I might have missed it or not gotten
it, please resubmit with a note -- or think about refining it.)  By the way,
RISKS production will have to slow down a little during June, because of my
schedule; so, be patient.  Maybe with school recesses, discussion will slow
down also.  But the world never rests, and we can assume that there will be
a few stellar cases of interest to RISKS.  PGN

As one of the culprits who found this feature in Erik Fair's *.test
message bouncer program,  I'd like to mention a couple of ways to protect
yourself (by the way, yes, it was an accident).

What is a *.test message bouncer?  If a user posts a message to "misc.test"
or "alt.test" this bouncer program will mail the posted message back to the
user.  This is often used by sites to determine if their news feeds are
making it out to the backbone (or, as in our case, to gather statistics
to determine the best news propigation path).

The symptom is that this one particular (the most popular) message bouncer
will send mail to every address on every From: line in the message.  This
includes From: lines in the message body.  Now that this feature has been
widely publicised in the "news.admin" newsgroup,  the best step is to warn
everyone before some net-terrorist decides to cause real havoc.

The message that caused the recent problems on the net had two features which,
when combined, resulted in a mess.
	(1) the message had 109 From: lines in the body
	(2) it was a large ~62k message

What happened?  Every site that had the message bouncer installed sent
out 109 62k mail messages.  Also, many of these mail messages failed because
of a bad address.  This lead to them to be bounced back to the originating
site (the one with the bouncer) to end up in the inbox of the Postmaster.
Needless to say, many sites had their spool partitions and usr partitions
filled to capacity within minutes of receiving that message.  Also, there

I just returned from attending the IFIP/SEC-88 conference on the Gold
Coast of Australia.  It's a meeting that addresses protection of
information systems in the broadest context.  SEC-88 is the 5th in a
series of roughly annual meetings, and is sponsored by TC-11, a technical
committee of IFIP -- approximately the international analog of AFIPS.

In addition to doing a keynote talk on "Perspectives on Trusted Systems", one
of the fun things for me was to participate in an evening public forum on
social aspects of computer technology.  In addition to myself, there were on
the platform an Australian computer expert (who organized the conference) and
two Australian politicians -- one a regional official of the Labor Party and
the other, a present conservative Member of Parliament.

I had been cautioned that the subject would almost certainly center around
the Australian ID card exclusively, and it did.  By the by, the story that
was told to me, and verified by something that I read down there, was that
the only reason that the legislation did not go into effect earlier was
that it contained a technical flaw; namely, in the haste of getting it
ready, a switch-on date was inadvertently omitted from the law.  This fact
came from a prominent member of the Australian Computer Society.

The argument that developed during the evening -- and it apparently is the
nub of the Labor Party position -- is that Australia has too much tax
fraud [sic] and that the ID card is the answer.  It seemed to me that the
proper word was "tax evasion."

It seems that the Laborites feel that too much income is escaping the tax
authority, and that it should be collected to make more revenue available
for social and other programs.  Obviously what Australia wants to do is
corral the taxpayer, as the IRS does with its Taxpayer ID; Australia wants
to be able to do the analog of tracking supplementary money flows as
reported on the various form 1099s and similar documents here.

Other than the tax-related matter, no other argument was given for the
institution of a universal ID card and number.

There was an amusing comment from the floor.  A member of the Swedish
delegation pointed out that Sweden has had a population register for
decades, if not centuries, and Sweden has substantial tax fraud still.

My concluding comment was to point out to the Labor person that it seemed
to me that he had a solution in search of a problem.  In the best
system-analysis tradition, I observed that the tax problem could very well
be real, but that it looked as though it had been assumed that a universal
ID was *THE* answer.  There clearly are other answers and the government
ought to do a more careful analysis of alternatives.  Something in the
spirit of the US/IRS arrangement would meet their tax needs, without
subjecting the Australian population to all the RISKS associated with a
genuine universal personal ID.

The whole thing was covered by a TV crew whose interviewer chaired the
session.  I was told that a lot of air coverage was given to the occasion
the following night, but I did not see it.

There seem to other RISKS in the Southern Hemisphere also; there has to be
one somewhere in the following story.  En route, I read an Auckland, NZ
newspaper which reported a cable car incident.  The Auckland cars are not
in the spirit of the San Francisco ones but evidently more like an
inclined railway running up and down a steep street in a more or less
straight line.

Seems as though a cable car had crashed into a bumper at the end of the line
with some injuries, but the RISK content is in the final words of the article:

     "The City Council had just spend [NZ]$90,000 
     reprogramming the onboard computer."

From the _Washington_Post_, 31 May 1988, page D-1 (without permission, of
course) comes the following article (credited to _Newsday_):

TEXAS TO HOLD A LANDMARK TRIAL ON COMPUTER TAMPERING BY 'VIRUS'

Texas prosecutors are preparing to go to trial in one of the first criminal
cases in the nation involving spohisticated tampering with a computer's
programming.

Donald Gene Burleson, a 39-year-year-old Fort Worth programmer, has pleaded
innocent to charges of computer sabotage and burglary involving the USPA
and IRA, Co., a Fort Worth-based insurance and securities concern.  He is
free on $3,000 bail pending a July 11 trial.

Burleson has lost a civil action in connection with the alleged 1985
computer tampering, and has been ordered to pay USPA about $12,000 in damages
and interest.

Prosecutors charge that after being fired in September 1985, Burleson deleted
records of thousands of sales commissions owed USPA employees from the
company's computer system, and also introduced into the system a hidden
program that would erase such data in the future.

Davis McCown, head of the Tarrant County district attorney's economic crimes
division, said in an interview last week that  the program "had the ability
to move through the [computer system], to change its name and to relocate."

[discussion of Trojan horses and viruses (virii?)]

[...] Burleson denied the charges and [said] that the company is blaming him
for someone else's actions.

"They really have no proof," [his lawyer] said.  "Anybody could have done
the deletions" from the commission payment records.

Subject: How did this program burn out two monitors?
Organization: University of California, Berkeley

I recently compiled a program that is supposed to do graphics on a Hercules
graphics adapter.  I've used a similar routine before, and I would have
sworn there was nothing wrong with the software.  Maybe the files got
corrupted.  When I ran the .exe file, my monitor made a high-pitched whine,
then the power light went off, and a crackling noise came out of the back
until I pulled the power cord.  Curious about whether this was a
coincidence, I took the program to work and tried it on an extra monitor I
had there.  The second monitor burned out too! I thought it was impossible
to damage my monitor and adapter with software.  Does anybody have any ideas
what caused this?  I'll post the .exe file and source (in C) to any brave or
curious souls who request them.

The hardware:
	1st time:  homebrew PC clone with generic Hercules clone card
		   Quimax DM-15 amber monitor.

	2nd time:  Leading Edge Model D, "turbo" with built in
		   Hercules compatible adapter, Quimax DM-14
		   amber monitor (an earlier version of the DM-15).

Neither video adapter was damaged.  Both monitors are DEAD.

       This is an old known bug.  You can burn out the IBM monochrome
monitor by stopping the horizontal sweep while keeping everything else
running, and the Hercules card gives you enough control to do this under
software control.  The video chip lets you select the horizontal and
vertical sweep rates independently, and zero rates are possible.  However,
the horizontal sweep is used as the oscillator for a switching power supply,
as is typical in TV circuits, and with the sweep rate at 0, DC flows through
a coil with high inductance but low resistance, producing an excessive
current that burns out the coil.

       Part of the problem is that the IBM monochrome monitor is a design
lifted from an earlier, pre-PC product line, the IBM Displaywriter, and in
that product, there was no potential vulnerability of this type.

My original message to RISKS, with the copy of the Daedalus article, contained
(or more exactly, since my files do not indicate one way or the other, I
believe contained) an explanatory introduction about Daedalus, and his splendid
articles. It was not my intention to test the gullibility of the RISKS
readership!

Adding to the information that has since appeared about Daedalus:

  (i) he is, I'm pleased to say, based here in Newcastle,

  (ii) he has been claimed to be the world's most successful builder of
perpetual motion machines! (A fascinating example, whose actual method of
operation is still a matter of some mystery, is I understand in the
Ontario Science Center, and

  (iii) he was the subject of a splendid documentary on BBC TV recently,
possibly in the Horizon series, which is worth looking out for, not least
for its account of his perpetual motion machines.

  &gt; just around the corner...

If this is the true condition of the cashless society in UK, you are
behind the Danish banks. For the last one and a half year I have been
able to do shopping and pay with my DanKort (in english: DanCard)
which is the card you receive from your bank if you want to have a
cashcard. In the Danish system all the banks has join forces and
developed a system with a card with crypt 4 digit PIN code on a
magnetic stip, a independent company runs the ATM automats, the pay
terminals in the shops etc. The system operated on high security
level; you get three attempts to enter your PIN code correct. If you
has not enter a valid code the card is automatical blocked and you
have to go to your bank, to raise the blockade. The obvious RISK in
this system is if anybody place a fraud ATM which just read the
content on the magnetic stip and the PIN code the custom taps in on
the keyboard. But at present I have not hear anybody trying this.

The Unix dump discussion illustrates having to balance two risks -- the risk of
committing errors as an all-powerful superuser, vs. the risk of having an
insecure system if access is improperly set for non-superusers.  As pointed out
by Brian Reid many months ago, giving system maintainers or administrators
special privileges, such as write permission on system directories, has its own
risks.  Unix is a complex system, and setting certain protections has
non-obvious side-effects.

For example, dvk advises that disks should be protected r--r--r--; in other
words, everyone will have read access to the raw disks.  This is equivalent to
giving EVERYBODY read access to ALL files on that disk! In some environments,
this may be ok, but other environments may want users to have some privacy.

Every site has to adopt some philosophy for dealing with Unix's all-or-nothing
approach to privileges.  I usually perform most system tasks as superuser, and
after a long (and sometimes painful) learning process, I'm now careful enough
not to destroy anything.

   Dumps should be run as "sys", or some other non-priv userID.  Disks should
   be owned by "sys", and protected r--r--r--.  

Actually, r-------- is more appropriate... otherwise anyone who can
get to /dev (which should be *anyone* since /dev/null is in there) can
read the entire mounted disk, violating any security the filesystem
was meant to offer. Running a debugger with macros for opening up the
file system structure makes it easy to find files by hand...

This message gives some very sound advice; one can, and should, avoid root
privileges if at all possible with UNIX.  [... comment on  r--r--r-- ...]

There are also problems with doing system administration as someone other than
root in a networked environment.  Lots of people have their own workstations
and can configure them any way they like, pretending to be any user who might
have interesting privileges, like "sys".  Sun's current version of NFS does not
perform any serious validation, so if you export a filesystem to my workstation
via NFS, I can read and write any file on it simply by setting up an account on
my workstation with the appropriate user-ID.  The only exception to this is
root: an NFS client is never granted root privileges by an NFS server.  So
there may be reasons why some things HAVE to be owned by root, even when it
would be better to avoid it, thanks to NFS.  (Sun OS 4.0 apparently fixes this
problem.)  In this specific case, I don't think device files can be accessed
under NFS (and you don't need to make the root filesystem exportable anyway),
but anyone trying this kind of thing should be aware of the general problem.

The 'Wall Street Journal' for Tuesday, May 31 features a story by Wendy L. Wall
headlined "FEW FIRMS PLAN WELL FOR MISHAPS THAT DISABLE COMPUTER FACILITIES"
(page 25 -- front page of Section 2).  The lead sentence says, "Welcome to the
era of the electronic disaster."

Starting with a review of the Hinsdale fire and its effects, the story discusses
"accidents that disable the concentrated computer and telecommunications
networks on which companies depend increasingly for basic tasks.... In a recent
University of Texas study, 75% of businesses surveyed said they would have a
'critical or total loss of functioning' within 14 days if they lost their
computer support.... Serious disruptions ... are becoming more common as
computers spread...."

"Most businesses are ill-prepared to cope with electronic disasters, computer
and communications specialists say....  Many top executives 'don't realize that
the value of the information  (in the computer) could very easily be worth
several times the value of their hardware, software and building,' says Steven
Christensen, a researcher at UT.  In addition, the cost of insurance or backup
computer systems can be high...."

Besides dividing operations between several sites, the other major precaution
taken by a growing number of companies is buying disaster insurance to use
backup computer centers and networks:  "The two largest disaster-recovery
companies ... have nearly 1500 clients...."

The major example used in the story is that of wholesaler United Staioners,
which has spent nearly $1 million a year on emergency preparations which served
them well in the present Hinsdale fire:  "Within hours, they dispatched a 31-man
team, with backup data tapes, to an insurer's computer facility in New
Jersey.... By the next day, they had reconstituted their entire computer
network.... Although all this cost some $600,000 over two weeks, including a
$40,000 fee for the insurer and travel costs for the 31 people sent to New
Jersey, it probably saved the company at least $30 million in sales during that
time, says United Staioners' CEO.  Even more important, he adds, was the boost
to customer confidence."

Running as root bad:

Someone from CMU berated the fella who'd messed up his disks for doing dumps as
root and suggested instead running as "sys".  hmm.  My first thought was "what
about files that people have protected against global reading?  You'd need root
to be able to read them".  But dump reads directly from the device... no
problem.  I'd suggest a small change -- make the permissions "400" rather than
"444" to prevent "everyone" from being able to read the disk.

In general however I've found it very good to engrave some of the more mystical
and hard to remember incantations into shell scripts and the like.  One of the
first projects I did here was to come up with a backup procedure for our
systems.  I of course used shell scripts for the whole thing...  I also put a
sticker on the console giving the format of the backup command for those times
when I was typing it directly, and relied on that sticker to jog my memory.

Multiple routes aren't multiple routes if they're the same physical route:

About the Hinsdale stuff.  There were a number of trunks heading into the same
building using the same exact physical route, right?  And the claim was that
the trunks were going over different routes.  Well, this just isn't a very good
assumption -- obviously.  One only needs to remember the arpanet outage a year
or so ago where a backhoe dug up some cables.  All of New England's ARPANET
traffic was ultimately routed through the cables that were in that one trench,
yet they were separate cables going over different "routes".
    
sigh                                                     [See <A HREF="/Risks/4.30.html">RISKS-4.30</A>.  PGN]

I think that we (as telecommunications customers) should have the ability to
demand proper seperate routes (physical routes) for backup communications ...

Daedelus thumb stuff:

Um, joke or no I'm surprised nobody got scared over the same thing I was
immediately scared over.  That there's all these financial transactions sitting
on my thumbnail and every time I purchase something I'm potentially telling the
store all of my financial dealings for the past N months.  That's a disclosure
of information they have no need or right to know.  Weell... they have a "need"
in that it would give them a better idea of who they're dealing with, but I
certainly don't want to be giving them such detailed information.

&gt; Yes, and for this reason, I've always liked the IBM translators, and
&gt; particularly the PL/I optimising compiler.  PL/I told you (as a
&gt; warning-level message) when it detected and deleted unreachable code.  

The last time I used an IBM PL/I optimizing compiler (some years ago), I had
a procedure which took two 32-bit integer arguments.  I called it with the
constant arguments 1 and 1.  It produces some cosmically weird results.
Eventually I put a print statement after the procedure entry; when the 1's
got passed to the procedure, they were somehow transformed into 65536's.

Somehow the compiler was interpreting the 1's as 16-bit numbers and putting
them in the wrong half of the 32-bit arguments.  I immediately switched to
non-IBM PASCAL.

It's about a year since I was last home, but Auckland didn't have any
cable cars then, and I very much doubt that they've got any now.  (The
Museum of Transport and Technology has a small tram system, but those
are old trams and have no computers.)  There's a cable car in Wellington
such as Willis describes, but then, Wellington is only the capital, can't
expect people to get _that_ right.  If the paper was the Sun, I've heard
that it's typeset by computer, perhaps that is the risk story?

    [Willis noted he read an Auckland newspaper.  We'll assume the cable 
    cars were really in Wellington, unless someone else contradicts it...  PGN]

About 2 years ago (Summer of 86) I bought a metallic balloon for my 2-year old
daughter.  It had a metal "string" about six feet long.  When we were getting
into the car, she let go of it, and it flew up into the corner of the parking
lot and tangled up in the power transformer there.  It shorted out the
transformer and killed power for half the town.

After my initial surprise at the damage, and feeling lucky that I didn't have
to pay for the damage, several thoughts crossed my mind.

  1. That metal string should never have been used.  Some powerline droop
     fairly low.

  2. I jokingly told some friends that you could really "take out" the power of
     a town fairly easily.  I was not aware how fragile our power system was.

  3. The potential for mischief and vandalism implied by #2.

In RISKS 6.87, Anita Gould asks about dry-run tests of halon equipment.
Here is a fortunate experience from such a dry-run:

To test that the equipment had been installed properly in a computer
room, a gas other than halon was put in the tanks.  The alarm was then
triggered manually, and the room was evacuated.  

Normally, the operator would have manually shutdown the system (Operating
System, not power down), and then left the room.  Since this was only a
drill, the operator left immediately.

When we returned to the room, one of the 'dispersers' from the tank
had shot itself across the room and was embedded in the wall.  These 
'dispersers' are cork-screw shaped metal objects, and have quite a point.
In line with the trajectory of the disperser was the operator's chair at
the console.

If the operator had actually stayed too long in the room to insure an orderly
shutdown of the system, his own shutdown would have instead occured.

The tank was then turned to aim elsewhere, but the dispersers are normally
not supposed to leave the tank.

Many readers of this digest will be interested in the article, "Information
technology and dataveillance," Roger A. Clarke, Communications of the ACM,
31(5): 498 - 512, May 1988.  This is a long review with 78 references.

The author defines "dataveillance" to mean the systematic use of computing
technology in the investigation or monitoring of the actions or 
communications of one or more persons.  He distinguishes betwen "personal
surveillance" - surveillance of an identified person, where there is a
specific reason for the investigation, and "mass surveillance" - surveillance
of large groups of people in order to identify individuals who might be of
interest to investigators.  The author concludes that computing technology
is making it much easier to perform both kinds, a lot of it is going on 
and more can be expected.  

The author says he does not argue that surveillance
is intrinsically evil or that it should be ruled out altogether, but 
argues that much of what is in fact now going on is in general a bad thing,
especially the mass surveillance.  He concludes that privacy and civil
liberties protections in place in most countries are inadequate to protect
against these new surveillance techniques.  The author says that he feels
people working in computing, due to their special knowledge, have some 
special responsibility to consider privacy implications of their work,
evaluate safeguards, and lobby for effective ones.

Organization: Public Access - Houston, Tx

(Paraphrased from The Houston Post, 29 April)

A local newscast carried a story on a Herpes research project under way at
Baylor College of Medicine, and displayed a phone number for volunteers to call
- with appropriate assurances of confidentiality.

Not only was it the wrong number, it was the number for the "back door" to the
public address system at Baylor (No indication of how large an area was covered
- it is a big place.)

The callers, hearing a pick up but no answer "assumed it was an answering
machine" and "gave their names, phone numbers, everything."

I believe this points up an important "human factor."  People are a lot less
cautious when they initiate a contact than when they are contacted.  This
explains the easy success of the typical "service spoof" attacks - password
harvesters and "night deposit box out of order" scams.  I don't have a magic
answer for designers of services - it is very hard to design a service that is
at all hard to spoof if the clients aren't at least a little bit cautious.


Second item:

One of the tigers went through a window in a door and killed an employee.  It
was at night and the public would not have been in immediate danger even in the
daytime, but the incident nevertheless caused quite a ruckus.

The firm that designed the enclosure stated that the door design, including the
window pane used, was "standard" for that kind of application.  The tiger had
no trouble going through it, and there was no indication that it was defective,
nor that any other tiger would have had any trouble going through any other
door of like design.

(Zoo officials have the big cats in holding cages while the window materials
used in the (relatively new) cat facility are tested - by swinging miniature
wrecking balls into them.  The cat facility is a modern close-contact one - you
can routinely find one of the lionesses sleeping against a window with the
public on the other side - in a tunnel.)

Apparently quite a few nominally professional people in the world think that
standards excuse them from thinking.  Perhaps that explains the popularity of
standards?

Applicability to computers?  Gee, there aren't any people clamoring for
standards in the computer industry, are there?

A society that depends upon any mechanism for its own proper functioning,
cannot tolerate, much less encourage, any tampering with the intended
operation of that mechanism.

Therefore, one is tempted to rise up in indignation at the idea of a qualified
academic assigning a virus to his students.  The next thing you know, they will
be assigning plagiarism.  How about the forgery of academic credentials?
Perhaps we should offer a course in how to falsify research results.  Or,
perhaps, on how to trash another's experiments, notes or reports.

Perhaps it is a sign of immaturity that we are unable to recognize the moral
equivalency.  I will leave open the question of whether the immaturity is in
the technology, the society, or academia.

I thought that we put this issue to bed several years ago when we stopped
assigning the breaking of security.  It seems that we did not.

For an academic to be unable to recognize that assignments, and the recognition
that goes with their successful completion, encourages the behavior assigned,
demonstrates a lack of understanding of the activity in which he is engaged.
If he understands it, and still makes such an assignment, he demonstrates a
lack of understanding of where his real interest rests.

Such irresponsible behavior may account, in part, for the anti-academic bias in
our society and for the manifest distrust of the scientific establishment.  It
is of little wonder that the citizens of Cambridge, Massachusetts are reluctant
to trust the likes of these with genetic engineering.

If there is any lesson that we should have learned from the computer, it is
that understanding the effects of what we intend for it to do is a daunting
task.  Even getting it to do what we intend is not trivial.  It seems to me,
that there is plenty of material here for assignments; we need not look to
assignments which are at best trivial, and at worst, dangerous.

        Subscribers to this list may be interested in the recent article
"Computer Viruses" by Peter J. Denning in the American Scientist, vol 76
page 236.  In particular, he discusses terminology.  Paraphrasing his
definitions:

1) Worm - a program that invades a workstation and disables it.
        &lt;one copy per machine, RAM resident, self propagation via network&gt;

2) Trojan horse - a program that performs some apparently useful
        function, but containing hidden code that performs an
        unwanted malicious function.
        &lt;file resident, propagation by unwitting human beings&gt;

3) Bacterium - a program that replicates itself wthout bound,
        thereby preempting the resources of the host system.
        &lt;many copies per machine, RAM resident, self propagating&gt;

4) Virus - a program that incorporates copies of itself into the
        machine code of other programs, and when those programs
        are invoked, performs a malicious function.
        &lt;two phase life cycle - RAM form with self propagation,
                                file form with human propagation&gt;

        Denning points out that these types often occur in combination.
A Trojan Horse is the most common means of originally introducing a
virus into a system.  For example, a Trojan Horse compiler can attach
a copy of the virus code to its output.

Defence against computer viruses comes out sounding like a message
from the Surgeon General.  Practice digital hygiene yourself.  Don't
exchange programs with anyone whose computer habits are not up to
your own standards.  Refuse to use software if the manufacturer's
seal has been broken!

        Maybe we need a "Centers for Computer Disease Control".

                          [No comments on the last sentence, please.  Recent 
                          issues of RISKS have beaten that idea to death.  PGN]

The real risk with the freon-halon-ozone controversy is best
understood when you realize that the Third World countries were
major opponents to the production freeze.  The major uses of
freons are:
 1) Refrigeration
 2) Manufacturing
 3) Fire Protection (only about 10%)
Freons have been shown to be much cheaper and much safer than the
alternative technologies.  Only recently have there been
indications that equally safe refrigeration technologies can be
practical, and these will be many times more expensive.

In the Third World refrigeration means much more than a cool car. 
It can mean the difference between life and death.  In food
production, refrigeration allows produce to reach markets, to be
stored safely.  Without it (and most underdeveloped countries
lack adequate refrigeration) food spoils, farm incomes drop
dramatically, people go hungry, people starve.  In medicine,
refrigeration means medicines that don't spoil and blood
transfusions.  Lack of refrigeration means death.  So the Third
World countries opposed the removal of freons.  Why agree to many
thousands of deaths just to keep the Americans happy?  The future
environmental destruction is a good reason, but with so much at
stake the evidence must be persuasive.  Even with the new
technologies, they must weigh the huge increase in costs against
their limited incomes.

The evidence from the computer models is weaker than the press
reports indicate.  The measurements of world ozone show an
*increase* of about 5% from 1960 to 1975 followed by a much
larger and faster decrease of about 15% since then.  The computer
models do not predict or explain that increase.  Their
predictions of what altitudes would have how much of a decrease
do not match the observed decreases.  The models did not predict
the Antarctic `hole', although this has a tentative explanation. 

I believe that the real deciding factor was the intuitive
decision by the negotiators that while the models were pretty
inaccurate, the measurement data was accurate enough to make the
trend very worrisome.  The rapid action following confirmation of
the satellite data calibration is consistent with this.  It also
is evidence of a cautious approach towards computer models.  The
research level was dramatically increased, both into the
atmosphere and into freon substitutes, after the initial modeling
results were published.  Freon uses with easy substitutions
(spray propellent) were eliminated in the US.  Oddly, the
Europeans did not follow suit.  The drastic changes were studied,
but no action taken until there was much more information.

The Montreal agreement also places real emphasis on more data gathering and
analysis following the agreed freeze and reduction in production.  The
reduction goal can be met with changes in refrigeration and manufacturing
without any change in fire protection uses.  The United States may move
internally for much larger reductions.  The large chemical companies may decide
to switch production entirely when suitable substitutes are found.  Dow has
announced its intention to completely phase out freon production.  The
international agreement is to reduce somewhat, then wait for more evidence from
measurements.

The cable car was in Wellington (in fact a guy in an office down the hall
was waiting to catch it at the time and watched it go right past the stop
and into the buffers at the end of the line).  I had intended to post
something at the time but the newspaper reports were pretty vague.

The cable car had only recently come back in service after its major yearly
maintenance which apparently included a rewrite of its controlling
software.  The braking system failed to engage, and several people suffered
minor injuries.  The current status (several weeks after the accident) is
that the cable car is still not running and samples of the code have been
sent to the manufacturer, a European (Swedish?) firm.

This is from memory, more details when/if they become available.    mark

The Sunday Times in the U.K. has produced, and is offering for sale, videos on
microcomputing, because ''...there is clear evidence that British management
has not yet appreciated the benefits of the microcomputer revolution.''

One of the benefits the Sunday Times has identified (June 5) is new to
most of us reading the RISKS forum, I suspect:

    ''In the computerised office information, once entered, is always
available....It is impossible to introduce an error, because the
transaction is entered once only.''

The discovery by the Sunday Times of computers that can prevent entry
of faulty data (provided, evidently, the entry is attempted once only),
must be of interest to us all.

But what of those reading the article who might believe it ?

forgery of academic credentials?"

One of the UK Polytechnics (virtual Universities) assigned a student
exercise that was to break into some system (I seem to recall it was an
11/44 running V7) and assign yourself an "appropriate" mark.  There was
quite a row about it at the time (about two or three years ago).  I'm

This is not really a "risk" but is yet-another case of increased legal
definition of programming.                                  Bob Devine

    A programmer was found guilty under a Colorado law when he destroyed a
  program.  A legal research company hired him to write a personal computer
  application that would permit a lawyer to search for relevant case law.
  
    When a deadline was approaching and a leave request was refused, the
  programmer resigned, telling the company that they would never have the
  program.  When the program could not be found on the system after he left,
  the company had to start over.

    The programmer was found guilty of theft and computer crime.

The following is excerpted from an Associated Press article by George Garties.
I can attest to the effectiveness of the measures described within as a 
customer of First Interstate Bank. Not once, in my experience, has a banking
problem at my local branch been blamed on the Los Angeles fire.


AFTER THE TOWERING INFERNO, FIRST INTERSTATE DOSEN'T MISS A BEAT

Cole Emerson has known for two years that when the big earthquake hits
California, it will be his job to get First Interstate Bank back into business.

When the city's worst high-rise fire swept the bank's headquarters last month,
Emerson saw his disaster plans put to the test, and by all accounts, they passed. 

[The May 4 fire gutted 4 1/2 floors of the 62-story building, killing a
maintenance man and closing the building for an indefinite period of time.]

But by the start of banking hours the next day, the vital business of First
Interstate Bankcorp, the nation's 9th-largest bank holding company, was
proceeding. And only one of the company's 320 California branches was closed.
The one on the building's ground floor.

Emerson, 42, is in charge of contingency planning and computer security. He is
assigned to First Interstate Bank of California, although in the headquarters
fire, his plan and staff also helped restart the parent company, which owns
banks in 13 states and franchises in 10 others.

He recalled that shortly after the fire broke out, his five-member "business
resumption group" and a parallel group that deals with staff safety opened the
bank's new emergency center in a computer operations building seven blocks
from the downtown headquarters.

As damage reports came in, Emerson's group orchestrated moves for the vital
groups that work in the headquarters.

They saw the securities trading department dispersed, with traders flying to
company offices in Hong Kong and New York, as well as taking borrowed space in
Los Angeles. They were prepared, since the disaster plan calls for traders and
other key employees to carry home diskettes bearing vital records from their
personal computers.

The main computers handling the bank's daily rush of consumer and business
transactions weren't in the headquarters, but if they had been knocked out,
they would have been backed up in Northern California.

The disaster plan was developed to deal with a great earthquake. The state
Office of Emergency Services says odds are better than 50% that such a quake
will hit the region in the next 25 years.

"An earthquake is real, and it's catastrophic, and it's going to happen,"
Emerson said. "There's nobody in my position in any of the banks who's going
to say 'if.' It's always 'when it's going to happen.' I feel even more 
confident right now that we're well on the way to being prepared for that."

    The mention of government involvement in assuring robustness of
telecommunications jogged my memory.  I recall reading of a particular
U.S. government agency, which is solely responsible for taking control
of telecomm services in the country in the event of a national emergency,
to insure that the government's communications abilities are maintained.
    The article went on to describe that the agency's control center was
located within the blast radius of several primary nuclear targets, and
no plans had been made to build redundant control centers.

U. S. Agency Rules Software Copyrights Protect Displays on Computer Screens
By Bob Davis,  WSJ, Tuesday June 7, 1988, p. 4.

WASHINGTON - The Copyright Office, in a boost to software publishers, ruled
that software copyrights protect displays on computer screens from
infringement.

Protecting software, either by patents or by copyrights, has been a muddled
field of law in recent years.  In a major case this year, Apple Computer,
Inc. sued Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. in March for copying
certain graphical display features that Apple popularized in its Macintosh
personal computers.  An Apple spokeswoman, however, said yesterday's ruling
doesn't directly affect that case.

Besides Apple, Lotus Development Corp. has tried to protect innovative
computer displays by bringing copyright-infringement cases against
competitors.  But in cases of this type, it hasn't been clear whether
copyright protection extends to instances in which companies, using
different computer codes, generate displays that look like those of popular
programs.

The Copyright Office, a part of the Library of Congress, rules that when a
software company copyrights a program, it automatically copyrights the
graphic and textual displays produced by the program.  At the same time, the
Copyright Office said publishers don't need to register any display or
textual screen separately.

"We think the screen will be protected, no matter what the code" used to
create it, said Richard Glasgow, the Copyright Office's assistant general
counsel.

As an example, Mr. Glasgow said that if Apple copyrights its Macintosh
software, the copyright "probably" protects the trash-basket symbol Apple
uses to tell users how to discard files.  Apple would only need to prove it
has "an original drawing" of the trash basket to be covered by the
copyright, he said.

... stock information ...

Decisions of the Copyright Office, which sets rules governing copyrights,
are influential in federal courts that interpret those rules.  Copyright
protection lasts for 50 years after the death of an author or for 75 years if
a company commissions the work and retains the copyright.

Jason Mirabito, a Boston copyright attorney, said the copyright decision
gives "greater protection and certainty" to software publishers.  Had the
Copyright Office required publishers to register every computer screen, he
said, judges would likely have interpreted the protection narrowly to cover
only exact copies of the disputed display screens.

But Mr. Mirabito said the broader copyright protection would likely
encourage judges to rule that software publishers can protect their programs
from competitors that merely "look and feel" like popular programs, but
aren't exact copies.

However, computer veterans worry that if protection is extended too broadly,
it may harm consumers and retard innovation, because it will slow the
development of standardized displays.  With such displays, computer users
wouldn't have to learn a new set of commands with every new software
program.

Moreover, "look and feel" cases are especially murky.  If Shakespeare were
alive, Mr. Mirabito speculated, he could have a copyright infringement case
against "West Side Story" because it's very similar to "Romeo and Juliet."

The Apple spokeswoman said the ruling doesn't affect the suit against
Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, filed in San Jose, Calif., because Apple had
filed separate copyright applications covering both the "literary and
audio-visual" aspects of the display features it wanted to protect.

In its suit, Apple also accused Microsoft of exceeding the limits of
licenses granted to it by Apple to use certain display features.  At the
time, computer industry analysts and intellectual property experts
interpreted the suit as Apple's attempt to preserve a technological edge
just as rivals were starting to close the gap.

    [This case never ceases to amaze me, particularly in that much of
    the innovation came from Doug Engelbart's Augmentation Research Center
    at SRI in the 60's and 70's, and thence from Xerox PARC.  PGN]

about accidental mis-use of dump wiping out a filesystem. The same sort of
incident happened here earlier this year when somebody (who shall remain
nameless to protect the horribly guilty [not me]) was running fsck on a
PDP 11/70 running V7. This person's only mistake was leaving out a space.
Instead of typing
	"fsck -t tempfile /dev/rroot"
s/he typed
	"fsck -ttempfile /dev/rroot"

(for those not familiar with the old fsck, the "-t" flag specified
a temporary file for holding tables that grew too big for small address
space machines). Unfortunately, this fsck came from well before the time
that "getopt" existed and manually parsed the arguments. It expected the
temp filename as the argument after the "-t", not glued to it.  The
result was that fsck used the root filesystem device for its temporary
storage (to ensure that the damage was severe, fsck starts by zero'ing
the temporary file :-) and started checking a default filesystem. In the
blink of an eye, the first 400 blocks of the filesytem were gone. Combine
this typo with a flakey emergency system which, for reasons we have yet
to determine, restored files incorrectly, and you can see that we had some
*real* fun getting the system back on-line.

Here's another risk in the use of the ATM cards:

At New Century Bank in Mundelein, IL there is an ATM terminal.  About a
month ago I used this terminal to make a sequence of transactions.  The
final transaction, a withdrawal of $20.00 was denied with a message "Cannot
complete, try later".  The card was ejected, with *no receipt* indicating
failure.  Thinking nothing of it, I went to another bank and obtained my cash.

About three weeks later the *same* thing occurred.  Suspecting something funny
was going on, I reinserted the card, and discovered to my horror that the ATM
had indeed debited my account, yet not dispensed any cash -- AND NO RECEIPT.

This time I got a little peeved.  The bank with the terminal (New Century) was
unable to help at the time of the incident -- they claimed they had to wait for
the "proof" from the machine the next day.  My bank said the same thing.

The next day, my bank said that yes, indeed, there was a transaction
recorded, and to their knowledge *it was paid by the machine*.  They put in
a charge-back request to New Century.

Upon more stringent questioning, they admitted that the charge-back might be
refused by New Century Bank, and that since I had no receipt to prove that
the transaction failed, I could be out the amount of the transaction in
question!   (the card agreement clearly states that receipts from the
machines are considered "official" evidence of a transaction or failure
thereof, and that they are the *only* evidence which the bank will accept!)

I placed a call to "Cash Station, Inc" (the regional company handling the 
ATMs in this area) in an attempt to discover why the machines had been 
programmed to not issue receipts on failed transactions.   Reaching someone 
with authority there took two days (!), and when I finally did get through 
the end result was that no change would be made.

New Century did eventually own up to having a problem -- in fact, they said
that after investigation I was not the only one who had been "hosed".  My
questions were (and still are):

o Why was this not caught when the machine was balanced?  It would seem as
  though if the machine recorded a debit of $20.00, and didn't issue the
  cash, that the machine would be out of balance by $20.00....

o After discovering that the machine was out of balance, why did New Century
  not attempt to rectify the problem themselves, or place the machine out of
  service until it was working properly?  WHY DID THEY POCKET MY CASH?

o Why was a decision made to not issue receipts on denied transactions,
  and why does Cash Station, Inc. refuse to *require* that institutions
  issue these receipts?  

o While I was on the phone with Cash Station, Inc. I inquired as to 
  the display of balances (this was another "sticking" point with me; they
  were often off by hundreds of dollars).  Their reply was that the network
  which interconnects the ATMs "cooks" your balance (!) depending on what
  you do at the terminal.  In other words, the balance shown by the terminal
  MAY NOT BE YOUR TRUE BALANCE.  When I asked as to why there was no
  indication anywhere that these numbers were "finagled" they indicated that
  the response time of the member bank's computers was insufficient to get a
  real balance.... sounded (and still sounds) fishy to me.  Isn't this
  *literally* fraud, as they claim that number on the screen to be your 
  BALANCE? (along this line, the machines do not dispense receipts on
  balance inquiries either -- perhaps to prevent you using these as
  "evidence".)

It would appear that someone (or many someone's) have been making out like
bandits on these "failures" -- I was hit twice within 30 days, at the same
terminal.  How many others (who don't balance their checkbooks and thus
never catch this kind of error) have also been taken for a ride?  

What is most disturbing is that there was no indication that the problems
would be resolved -- that is, no one was willing to state that they would
begin (now or any time in the future) to provide receipts on all
transactions in order to facilitate proof of what had occurred.

I have decided to boycott all ATMs in the Chicago area until I receive some
satisfactory answers to these questions.  So far no one has been able to
provide them.  I suggest that others who are concerned for the safety of
their funds also boycott the ATMs.  Go to a Jewel (food store), where you 
can still use the card, yet you deal with a *human* who hands you your money.

This card was intended as a plastic card. I never saw any intention of
a smart-card system. The initial idea came from the HEALTH department,
as all eligible residents carry a "Medicare" card for the national
health system. The Australia Card was to replace the Medicare card for
the health system, and was also to be used for taxation, social
security and other financial transactions. (For example, to open bank
accounts, or start jobs, or employ brokers/agents, so any taxable
transaction could be followed.) As the idea evolved, more and more
departments and uses were included. I think over a dozen departments
and 25+ "systems" were to have access to (part of) the database.

With 15M people, that is one ENORMOUS database.

The benefits the Govt. were flogging (and quite hard too) was savings
on social security and tax fraud. (Numbers like $1b/year - about 2-3%
of the Govt. budget).

There was to be a "Data Protection Agency" that was to monitor and
control access to the sections of the database. No-one really believed
it would work.

The idea was killed after the largest, loudest and longest public
campaign I have seen. Many groups joined in, from the looney left to
the radical right, including most professional Computing and
Engineering bodies, as well as the obvoius civil liberties groups.

The RISKs? This proposal took on an awesome momentum, and grew
frighteningly fast. I'm glad it was killed off before it started
as unwinding or even slowing the increase would be enormously 
difficult. And governments aren't known for taking tough decisions.

One of the arguments in favour of the card was that with one centralised
database, and legislative controls over access, we as citizens would
actually be better off as far as protection and privacy were concerned.

From the Dallas Morning News, June 7, 1988, without permission:

     "Glitches" in a new computer program used by air traffic
controllers at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport can temporarily
obliterate information on altitude, airspeed, ... types of aircraft in
the area ... the call signs [,] and intended destinations of aircraft.
     The same program is used at airports in Houston, Los Angeles, and
Atlanta.
     "When the program is running and it detects a glitch in the system
... it will remove the alphanumerics on the screen for a period of 20
seconds or less," said Lawrence Parrent, assistant air traffic manager
at the D/FW Terminal Radar Approach Control center, or TRACON.
     ....
     An audible alert is sounded when the data blocks are about to
disappear, and FAA officials say the controllers have up to five seconds
to either write down the information or memorize it.
     Parrent said FAA officials do not believe the glitch constitutes a
safety hazard.  "The radar has not failed," he said.  "The primary
target is still there."  The radar image and a four-digit number
assigned to each aircraft remain on the screen.
     ....
     Parrent said that the new program offers many features that improve
the margin of safety in air traffic operations ...
     [Discussion of potential problems if the "glitch" occurs during
holding patterns or handoff from en-route controllers to approach
controllers.]
     FAA officials say controllers are able to determine the altitude of
aircraft just as they did before the software was developed -- by asking
the pilots.
     [Comments from Parrent about controller uneasiness.]
     [Testing began in January, increased to 24-hour-a-day use after
April.]
     "The reason we are testing with live traffic is that we do not have
the capability to simulate the number of targets in off-line
conditions," Parrent said.  "We have to test under actual conditions.
     "It's like other aviation-type equipment -- just like an airplane.
You put it in a wind tunnel and it looks great, but you still have to go
out there and put a test pilot in it and fly the darn thing."

End of article.

Comments:

The system itself is obviously aware of a problem, or it wouldn't be
able to sound a warning.  Wouldn't it be better to leave the information
on the screen, even if updates are frozen until the 20-second problem is
over?  Even if the only benefit is to avoid disturbing the controllers?
And "up to five seconds" to record information on "up to ten" aircraft?
(The number's in the article, I just omitted it.)  Did anyone ask the
controllers what *they* would like to see in the new program?

The FAA apparently considers this a minor problem because when it fails
it's just equivalent to the old system.  What about (a) becoming
dependent on the new features and (b) the "startle factor" when the
warning sounds?  Did the problem show up before the peak-period testing?
If so, how come it hasn't been fixed in five months, and if not, isn't
that an extra worry?

Since I'm working on simulations and simulators at the moment, I can
sympathise with the inadequacy of off-line testing, but I'd rather the
field-test were on something less important than an air-traffic control
system.  Sounds like a good argument for better simulation technology and
more computing power to use what's already there.

Subject: The Challenger and visionary software architects

The May issue of Defense Science validates something that many computer
scientists have probably suspected: ultimately, the failure of the Challenger
and the death of the astronauts was due to a control loop software design
oversight - just another bug.

To what extent must software architects be visionaries? Certainly the
requirements are proportional to the power of the system the software controls.
Do such visionaries exist to design our Challengers and our other more
aggresive weapons?

Of some small relevance to Risks, and of possible interest to readers, is
a recent book:  "How To Stop A War", James F. Dunnigan and William Martel,
Doubleday 1987.  The authors are military analysts, not peace marchers.
A good look at the realities of why wars start or don't.  (Sample:  "As
long as there have been technically complex weapons, there have been
accidents.  For example, one sixth of the losses of modern battleships
were due to accidental explosions.  If such a formidable ship can
accidentally demolish itself, it's no wonder users are fearful about
the safety of current systems...  During the 1986 Air Force raid on
Libya, two F-111 aircraft were needed for every one that got through
in working order to drop its bombs.")

   The UK Polytechnic that Ian Batten was talking about is described as
case 78.066 in the book "Computer Insecurity" by Adrian Norman (Chapman
and Hall, New York, c. 1983, p. 191.)  This book, incidentally, is an
excellent collection of incidents involving computer security (or lack
thereof) and even does some analysis to show some things that lead to
security problems.  (The computer was a DEC10 system, not a PDP-11/44;
other than that, though, the details are exactly the same.)

   Yet another root typo story: a certain person who had superuser privileges
once accidentally typed "exit" rather than "halt" to leave superuser
mode.  The former does just that; the latter halts the CPU ...

Israel  does implement  a system  of  a national  ID card,  used by  all
government  agencies,  banks, hospitals,  employers,  etc.  There is  no
central database (yet!) but information cross-over is relatively easy.

Last month  a man  requested for  a loan  from a  bank; his  request was
denied because (the bank claimed) he  had just applied for the same type
of loan  two years  ago. Checking it  out, the poor  guy found  out that
there was another man  with a similar name, who had  the same ID number,
and what's more, the other guy was a criminal wanted by the police.

It  seems that  the criminal  had  lost his  ID  card a  few years  ago,
requested a new one,  and the Ministry of the Interior  had issued him a
new one - with the other man's  number! They claim that since the system
has been computerized by now, such a mistake cannot happen again...

In reply to Karl Denninger's posting...

I don't see any risks in his story that can be attributed specifically to
the use of ATMs, as opposed to the more general use of a Bank.  If
anything, the risk is assuming that a transaction that is "untouched by
human hands" will be less likely to go wrong when, in fact, it is more
likely to have something go wrong.

Specific points:

  -  The error undoubtedly *was* caught when the machine was counted out
     at the end of the day (assuming that your bank follows accepted
     accounting procedures).

  -  They didn't know it was "your cash".  The machine ended up the day
     with too much money, which means that one (or more) of the 500
     people who used the machine that day got short-changed.  Undoubtedly
     people were assigned to look into the problem if it has happening
     on a regular basis (probably a mechanic was sent out to clean and
     oil the ATM).

  -  I have never gotten a receipt for a failed transaction.  Requiring a
     receipt for a failed transaction sounds sort-of bogus to me, as one
     of the (dozens of) failures that can happen is that the receipt
     printer breaks or runs out of paper.

  -  There is no such thing as a "true balance" from the bank's point of
     view, as you undoubtedly have a bunch of "paper" (checks, credit
     charges, etc.) floating around that they haven't seen yet.  Also,
     contrary to popular opinion, electronic funds transfers are seldom
     posted against the "bank of record" in real-time -- rather, they go
     onto a tape somewhere and get fed in at night.  So, any "balance"
     that your bank would report is necessarily flakey.

     Indeed, there are response-time requirements placed on banks that
     are wired in to ATM networks (typically a few seconds).  Since the
     "real" records are on a tape in the back room, the "front-end"
     computer only has your balance as of last night (or, maybe the night
     before) plus the electronic transactions that it has seen go by.  It
     may have missed some electronic transactions, e.g., due to crashing
     and/or a network failure.  It hasn't seen any of the day's paper.
     The electronic transactions that it has seen haven't been verified yet.

Electronic banking systems are incredibly complicated.  It is impossible to
even imagine the number of things that can go wrong, or the number of ways that
clever consumers can subvert the system.  Of course, this is nothing new with
ATMs -- financial fraud has been around as long as banks.  It is quite sensible
for an ATM's programming to "lean" in the bank's direction is there is
something amiss, because the consumer will always go complaining to a bank
officer.  When was the last time that you got *over*-changed and actually
reported it?

Go ahead and boycott the machines if you want.  However, if you want them
to improve, then you have to exercise the system so that the bugs will be
found and fixed.  If your bank is not responsive to your bug reports, then
find another bank.

I have always refused to possess an ATM card, on the grounds that the
individual is not well protected against the banks' errors, particularly
since bank employees perceptions of the possibility of malfunctions differ
from mine.

My feeling has been strengthened in the past by one or two highly
publicised cases of the banks' intransigence in the face of complaints of
``phantom'' withdrawals from ATMs.

I've not seen a case of this type now for a few years, and was beginning to
succumb to the idea that the safeguards have improved, when I came upon an
article describing the UK Banking Ombudsman.  He is the arbiter of last
resort for customer complaints, and will only accept cases that have
exhausted the relevant bank's internal complaints procedure (usually at
general manager level).

According to Money Management(June '88), the Banking Ombudsman received 198
complaints in March 1988.  The category with the highest number of
complaints was.....

``Cashcards - unauthorised withdrawal'' with 17 (~9%) complaints.

Are there any figures for other countries banking systems?

	Unauthorized access to software cited
	       Shuttle security lapse
		 by Richard Doherty

An accidental breach of software security at Rockwell International Corp.
gave unauthorized engineers and programmers access to raw code being prepared
for the space shuttle Discovery's return to space, now slated for Aug. 22.
The six-month lapse in security resulted from "an unintentional keyboard
error," Last November, the most recent embodiment of "Operational Increment"
shuttle software (revision OI8-A) was somehow stripped of its normal RCAF
[Resource Access Control Facility] protection... [IBM] Engineers discovered
on Nov. 22, 1987, that they were able to modify the code while in the
supposedly restrictive "browse" mode.  An IBM supervisor then immediately
notified NASA, and by afternoon's end, a weekend-long bit-by-bit comparison
was initiated.

NASA says that in all, 16 changes were made.  The agency still does not know by
whom or when.  Because multiple copies of the OI8-A software existed at that
time, NASA said there is no chance the security breach could endanger the
mission.

NASA conducted a six-month long inquiry into how the event happened.
As a result, the agency said it now knows the normal protection was
somehow stripped off during a change in editing modes (between integer
and block) and who the operator was at the time.

But NASA said it still doesn't know how many accesses were made and by
whom over a six-month period.  Nor has it discovered why it took six
months to notice the code was open to editing.

Shuttlegate?

The acknowledgement by NASA and Rockwell engineers came in the wake of
a $5.2 million lawsuit field by shuttle engineers who were dismissed
after expressing concern about overall OI8-A software vulnerability,
among many other problems, to Rockwell management last fall.

The engineers, Sylvia Robins and Ria Solomon, first took their concerns
to the company's ombudsman, then to the NASA Inspector General and,
eventually, to the White House.

Finally, seeing no action taken on their concerns regarding accelerated
software verification audits and a steady lack of secure data access,
Robins and Solomon took action by filing a lawsuit here [Houston] against
Rockwell and its prime software contractor, Unisys, last fall.  That action
triggered widespread denial by Rockwell of the lawsuit's many safety concerns,
including the charge of lax shuttle programming security that was finally
acknowledged last month.

[There's more, but this is getting long.  Any idea what "between integer
and block" modes mean?]                           Martin

Page one (below the fold) of the 6/7/88 morning edition of The
Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) reports:

[BEGINNING OF ARTICLE]
"Sewage flows into river; computer failure blamed"

* The five-hour spill from the Sullivan Pump Station poured about 5.4
million gallons into the Willamette River downtown

A computer failure caused about 5.4 million gallons of raw sewage to
spill into the Willamette River in downtown Portland early Monday,
prompting state officials to warn against recreational use of the river
through Tuesday morning.

"That's a major spill," said Shirley Kengla, spokeswoman for the Oregon
Department of Environmental Quality.

[What a quote!  We Oregonians now know what a major spill is...
sheesh.]

The spill began about 3 a.m. when a computer failure at the Sullivan
Pump station caused sewage to flow directly into the river [...]. The
spill was stopped by 8 a.m. [...].

Peterson [operations director] said the computer failure was caused by
a loss of electrical power, shutting down the pumps at the pump
station.

He said the computer system was designed so that the operators could
override computer commands at the station, but they discovered Monday
they could only do that when the computer had electrical power [!!!].
Monday's loss of power prevented that.

[... more stuff about volume and repair efforts ...]

Kengla said the DEQ is investigating the spill.

"Because it was a computer failure, it was an accident [!!!] and for
that reason, we're just looking toward making sure it doesn't happen
again," she said.

[... more stuff about location of spill ...]

Contact with the water could cause sickness with severe flu-like
symptoms.

In June 1985, another computer failure caused the dumping of more
than 3 million gallons of raw sewage into the Willamette from the
same pump station.  Kengla said that state and city officials had
been working to prevent a recurrence of the problem.

"We thought we had done enough, but obviously we hadn't," she said.
[Brilliant quotes!]

[... stuff about another tiny spill last year, not computer-related...]
[END OF ARTICLE]

(1) Why did they have a computer-controlled system that depended on
    electrical power to operate with no backups?

(2) Given that they already had a failure before, how could they have
    failed to design a failsafe system?

(3) The statements made by the spokeswoman, like "because it was a computer
    failure, it was an accident..." make me wonder.  Why should an accident
    be so obviously required to happen after a computer failure?  Why
    should we not *plan* for the system to break?  These guys obviously
    didn't.

Sheesh.  And during Rose Festival too!

          [This case] points out, once again, the need for total design

          overrides instead of requiring all control signals to originate
          from the automatic control system.  Conversation with the writer
          lead me to believe that there was a wide-spread power loss which
          may have precluded operation of the pumps as well, in which case
          nothing would have helped.  Note, however, that the computer gets
          the blame.   [R. England]

PS warned against SINing

By Iain Hunter
Citizen staff writer

   Treasury Board President Pat Carney has ordered bureaucrats who run hundreds
of federal programs to SIN no more.  And Justice Minister Ray Hnatyshyn has
warned that the government may bring in laws to regulate the collection and use
of the social insurance number if other levels of government and the private
sector don't follow the federal example.

   Carney announced Thursday that the use of the individual identity number
will be phased out over five years in several institutions to reduce the risks
of invasion of [...] privacy.  Carney said the use of the SIN will be
restricted mainly to the administration of tax, pension and social benefit
programs.  Any new collection or use of the SIN beyond those covered under the
new policy will have to be approved by Parliament.

   A Treasury Board spokesman said "hundreds" of programs in which the number
is now used will be affected by the new restrictions.  The cost of phasing out
the use of SIN is estimated at $16 million.

   Privacy Commissioner John Grace called Carney's announcement heartwarming
and said it puts the federal government "in a much stronger moral position to
preach controls on the use of SIN to other governments and the private sector."

Earlier this week (Monday) the T.A.B suffered a major loss of a
computerised betting control system which caused much anguish to punters
across the state of Victora.  I phoned their computer manager &amp; got a
loose description of the problem, he was understandably reticent since
the network manages many millions of dollars of bets daily, and there
are public relations issues aside from the security ones.

	Brief Description of TAB &amp; Gambling:
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Gambling, the 4th most ancient vice after programming sex, religion and
politics is endemic in Australia.  It is also very tightly controlled by
the state, concentrating in several HUGE casinos with banks of "pokeys"
or one-armed bandits, and of course the ponies. [remember phar lap anyone?]

Apart from pre-computed instant win cards and lotterys the only [legal]
form of betting off the racetrack in Australia is run by the T.A.B.  or
Totalizer Agency Board.

They run a "totalizer" scheme, where the pool of cash placed in any
given race is split into the dividend, so that the winnings are more
"socially" adjusted, and also not simply calculated from starting price
("SP" bookmakers thrive in the better drinking establishments and police
stations, according to popular myth &amp; corruption tribunals) however
there is an element of feedback, in that offered "odds" are obviously
adjusted according to the poolsize as well as traditional form, much as
in normal betting.  the "divi" depends on the size of the pool and is
post-close-of-betting calculated, although a running total could be
available (I don't know for sure, I'm not a gambling man you
understand...)

Each state has a transaction processing network which underpins this
exercise, so that the pool/dividend holds across the entire state for
each race.

	The Problem:
	++++++++++++

The Victorian T.A.B.  uses a tightly coupled "cluster" of 5 nodes
handling the incoming transactions, and a central node that acts as a
controller and calculates the divi.  Some form of shared memory is used
to do all this.

At some stage in the day the central node noticed an inconsistency in 2
separate pools, across two of the nodes.  They were disconnected,
possibly automatically.  Afterwards, the entire network was taken down
and the betting calculated manually to prevent any data inconsistency
being propagated out into the real world.  -From the "feedback"-y nature
of the tote algorithm it's plausible that had this not been done, many
many thousands of punters would have been rooked of their winnings..
actually perhaps they would have made too much money as well!

-The problem was verbally ascribed to software, but no details are
available.  According to radio reports over $1M was lost due to the much
less efficient manual methods.  Punters were furious.


I wanted to end with some pun about shutting the sTABle door after the
horse has bolted, but I can't think of a good punchline.

A tip of the hat to John Pershing (pershing@ibm.com) for his reply
concerning risks of ATM's (RISKS 7.6). This piece is truly a standout in
that it is (a) not anecdotal and (b) not hysterical in tone. I commend it to
others as a model for crafting their arguments and replies.

&gt;From: stork@humu.nosc.mil (Kent Stork)
&gt;The May issue of Defense Science validates something that many computer
&gt;scientists have probably suspected: ultimately, the failure of the Challenger
&gt;and the death of the astronauts was due to a control loop software design
&gt;oversight - just another bug.

I have grabbed the May issue of Defense Science (an oxymoron):

%A Yale Jay Lubkin
%T The Challenger Disaster
%J Defense Science
%V 7
%N 5
%D May 1988
%P 13-18 (actually only 3 pages)

This article neither validates nor mentions software, bugs, or computers.
There are two sets of problems 1) Kent's comment, and 2) the article itself.
The article is basically a summary of different causal hypotheses: the
cold joint and the AW&amp;ST puncture (Abu-Taha) hypotheses.  There is a good
tone of conspiracy in the paper, but I am not in a position to side in
defense of Washington bureaucrats or Lubkin.

The closest comment to "control loop software design" is:
	"It was not the leak that killed the astronauts.  It was the
	attempt to correct the sidethrust, which sent the Challenger
	into violent oscillations.
There are probably some difficulties in asserting "cause."  Further:
	"If the Challenger had been permited to go off course,
	without attempting the major correction, the side booster would
	not have broken out, the booster would have burnt out with the
	Callenger still intact, and the crew could have ejected, off
	course but aslive."
This latter is probably false, but we will not really know.  I don't usually
trust words like "ultimately."

Researching this article did have a positive side benefit while in the library,
I found a good 5 page obit to Richard Feynman in Engineering and Science
[Caltech's Alumni magazine].

There is a very "hardware must fly" orientation in NASA, and you should
understand software is not well understood in the Agency.  
This was documented by internal reports [Sagan et al. 1980].
Any disaster will have underlying PHYSICAL causes sought.

&gt;To what extent must software architects be visionaries? Certainly the
&gt;requirements are proportional to the power of the system the software controls.
&gt;Do such visionaries exist to design our Challengers and our other more
&gt;aggresive weapons?

I take some offense at you calling the Challenger a weapon, and I know
several thousand others who would, too.  I would not call any of the software
people working on the Shuttle "visionaries," there is a degree of
salesmanship, however.  Your codes have to withstand many walk throughs
(or walk overs depending on your prespective 8-). Don't think the control
problem scales linearly, it doesn't, typically O(n^2) and greater.

From _Computerworld_, 13 June 1988, p. 4 (without permission, of course):

   CASINOS FIGHT PLAN FOR COMPUTER ACCESS

   Atlantic City -- In a major dispute over government access to corporate
   computers, 11 Atlantic City casinos are fighting a proposal by the New
   Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) to obtain direct access to
   casino computers for investigations.

   Unfettered computer access is necessary to fully investigate and regulate
   casino operations, DGE officials say.[...]

   The casinos have been joined in their battle by privacy experts, who say the
   proposal would set a dangerous precedent by allowing government agents to
   go on secret "fishing expeditions" through business computers.  Public
   comments on the proposal are due this week.

   [discussion of parallel paper-and-electronic records, due process
   requirements, etc...]

   The proposed regulation, published last month and pending before the state's
   Casino Control commission, would require the licensed casinos to provide DGE
   investigator with inquiry-only access to ALL [emphasis supplied] computer
   records.

   The requirement would have the following conditions:

   * The New Jersey casinos must provide the DGE with an on-site terminal and
     the capability to make printouts.

   * DGE personnnel must be given "reasonable privacy in which to conduct such
     inquiries."

   * Casinos may not track or monitor the DGE inquiries, and casino computers
     must be programmed to preclude any such tracking.

   * Casinos may request a log of DGE inquiries that shows the general category
     of information examined and the time of the inquiry.

   * Each casino must train DGE personnel in the use of its computer system.

   [The DGE tried to get this done four years ago but was blocked by a court
   order requiring extensive hearings.  DGE changed the procedures under which
   the demands were made, prompting] an April 7 filing by 11 of the 12 Atlantic
   City casinos [which] raised numerous objections and argued that the new
   proceeding defies the 1985 court order.

   [discussion of the loss of audit trail info for inquiries, which would make
   it impossible for anyone to know if compromised information had been leaked
   by a DGE employee or someone else.]

Wow.  Regardless of one's stand on how deeply the Mob owns the casinos,
you've got to wonder just who if anyone at DGE knows how to spell "Computer
Security".  After we've been careful to build security audit capability into
systems (and screaming about how dumb designers of the older systems were
for not doing so), now comes DGE with orders to shut them down.  Anyone want
to give some odds on some other part of DGE filing charges against the casinos
for failing to maintain an audit trail of access to the detailed profiles they
keep of the high rollers?

Disclaimer: the odds are very high that you won't be able to show any link
between yours truly and any casino or the DGE, mainly because there isn't
any.  Of course, we all know how easily computer records can be changed...

The following is from The Independent of 15th June 1988, reproduced without
permission.

                                   * * * *

                 COUNCIL WAR BUNKERS HIT BY COMPUTER PROBLEMS

The Home Office has suspended installation of a critical part of the
Government's wartime communications network, a multi-million pound
computerised link-up for local authority bunkers.

A national programme for the installation of the County Message Switch system
was halted at the end of March because of "Software Problems"

The Home Office confirmed yesterday that the software was still being tested.

One county emergency planning officer has privately described the situation as
"an absolute botch-up".

Bunkers in Lancashire, North Yorkshire, Cornwall and Somerset have been
affected by the delay following extensive teething problems encountered during
a pilot installation in Bedfordshire.

It is understood that the system's memory specifications are so limited that
district computers can only take about eight messages before previous files
are automatically deleted.

One source said yesterday that the Home Office had suggested that punctuation
and spaces should be left out of messages in an attempt to avoid overloading
the system. But there have been complaints that this would make messages more
difficult to decipher.

There are also complaints that because of a lack of back-up batteries, a power
cut would result in the computer system's entire memory being automatically
wiped out. [Note: bunkers have their own generators, but EMP from a nuclear
airburst could easily disrupt the supply]

                                   * * * *

[Note: In the UK, the Civil Defence plans in time of war are to keep the
population in the towns and cities where they live, and devolve power to
Emergency Regional Seats of Government if central Government is
incapacitated.]

One of the thoughts that occurred to me was this:

Why upgrade from teletypes to a new [?] computer system. After all, the
message capacity of a teletype in that of the roll of paper attached, and they
don't need rebooting after a power failure. You can also read them in the dark
by using a torch. If you were getting really technical you could use an
incoming teletype, and outgoing terminal/teletype.

And another one was:

Upgrading this sort of computer system is very dangerous. The more complex the
technology involved (ICs, DRAMS, Magnetic Media etc) the more prone it is to
damage from ElectroMagnetic Pulse from Nuclear Weapons, fluctuations in the
generator supply and other adverse operating conditions. A simple teletype is
less technologically advanced and therefore probably *more reliable* in these
conditions.

And finally:

Is this going to end up as another Nimrod fiasco, where the UK government
spends millions of pounds on a system, and then scraps it and buys from the US
instead?

	"German incident sours Blackhawk shield plan

 The United States Army says it will speed up plans to shield the UH-60
 Blackhawk helicopter from radio-wave interference following an incident
 in West Germany earlier this month [May].  On May 11, a Blackhawk flying
 near a large group of powerful antennae banked into a right-hand turn for
 five seconds without any pilot commands.

 [...] An Army spokesman, Major Phil Soucy, said on Friday that tests had
 shown the problem of electromagnetic interference did not jeopardise
 flight safety.  ``We certainly are not going to ground the (Blackhawk)
 fleet because there's no reason to'' Major Soucy said.  He said the Army
 had begun talks with the helicopter's manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft,
 on shielding a number of electronic components.

 [Details on Knight-Ridder report of 5 accidents and 22 deaths, since 1982]

 The Army and Sikorsky, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp of
 Hartford, Connecticut, disputed that report, saying there was no
 evidence that electromagnetic interference had caused any crashes."

The following was passed to me from David Kucharczyk &lt;ssr@cos.com&gt;:  Taken
from the Sydney Morning Herald and the May 22, 1988 issue of Awake magazine.

In an effort to outwit phonebooth thieves, Telecom, Australia's government-
owned telephone company, has fitted the susceptible booths with Kirk safes.
Named after the worker who invented them, the safe has so far proved 100-
percent effective. As mentioned in the Sydney Morning Herald, it has with-
stood 'oxy torches, ramset guns, angle-grinders, hydraulic jacks, pulley
clamps, centre-punches and bricks.' Ironically, the new safes appear to have
led to an increase in vandalism, as theives frustrated by the tough safes
vent their anger on the booths. Telecom reports that the current rate of
smashed glass and ruined handsets and cords is at a new high of 3,000 cases
per month.

[note by Geoff:  reminds me of the time my car was broken into in an 
unsucessful attempt to steal the stero/casette player.  the shattered glass
everywhere, the mangled radio face plate, storage of the car in a secure
location until i could obtain an appointment at the fix-it shop, the overhead
of taking the car in / pick-up, etc -- all besides the expense/insurance
deductable.  quite a hassle, for which i would have given the radio away to
have avoided!]

The following is the editorial by Daniel E. Koshland Jr. in the 29 April
1988 issue of Science; it has relevance beyond the scientific community.
[Reprinted (sigh) without permission.]

  "Discussion of fraud in science is becoming a cottage industry in need of an
  environmental impact report.  Fraud is devastating to science; it undermines
  the basic respect for the literature on which the rapidity of scientific
  advance depends.  It must be rooted out wherever and whenever it is
  discovered.  That makes it all the more imperative that charges of fraud be
  made responsibly and that the performance record of whistle-blowers be
  scrutinized as well as those of the scientists they criticize.  In recent
  times we have been exposed to excesses in whistle-blowing and journalism
  that come close to the evils they wish to eradicate.  We see, for example,
  the charge that there is widespread fraud, followed by a text defining fraud
  as a broad concept including "misconduct".  Misconduct is then interpreted
  to include such items as poor proofreading or incomplete references.  In a
  recent congressional hearing, misconduct was further broadened to include
  a difference in interpretation of complex data.  Crying wolf tends to lose
  effectiveness when the wolf is redefined as a vicious mouse and then it is
  further conceded that the viciousness is a matter of opinion.

  "The slowness of institutions in conducting investigations is viewed by some
  as evidence of an "old boy" conspiracy.  But there are good reasons to be
  slow to accuse a colleague.  A student works in close cooperation with a
  professor for months or years and finally solves a problem.  A statement
  by the professor that "we can't publish until the result is checked" might
  eliminate a few cases of fraud, but it would forever damage the relation
  between student and professor.  Institutions that are quick to accuse
  distinguished faculty members of misconduct or worse on the basis of gossip
  or flimsy data will not long have a distinguished faculty.  The fate of
  whistle-blowers who have lost their jobs or failed to continue in science
  is often recounted as evidence of retaliation, but the quality of the
  whistle-blowers' work is relevant to this conclusion.  The idea that
  scientists may cut corners to achieve fame, but whistle-blowers never do,
  is nonsense.  Past track records are not always a guide to future conduct --
  some distinguished scientists err, some erratic whistle-blowers are right
  on occasion -- but scientists, like ordinary citizens, are innocent until
  proven guilty.  Investigation of their integrity should require substance.
  It is not a cover-up for an institution to refuse to initiate an inquiry
  if the only evidence is the accusation by an unreliable source.

  "The scientific apparatus cannot afford to disregard accusations of fraud,
  and competent whistle-blowers help science.  Investigations should be
  pursued meticulously, but the final report should strongly state the
  outcome:  If the accusation is correct the miscreant should be punished
  and the whistle-blower commended.  If, however, the accusation is incorrect,
  in addition to the usual bland announcement of exoneration there should be
  a denunciation of the false charges and a documentation of the time,
  anguish, and delay that has been occasioned.  Science cannot tolerate
  fraud, but it should not be at the mercy of headline-happy journalists
  or incompetent whistle-blowers.

  "Journalists must distinguish between fraud, sloppiness, and differences of
  opinion.  When an accusation of fraud is made, if the evidence appears
  weak or the charge exaggerated a careful journalist should be alerted to
  probe more deeply.  Opinions of noninvolved experts on the likelihood of
  error and the track record of the accuser should be documented early on,
  even in the initial story.  The original story may have to state the facts
  of an accusation before all the background is obtained, but in most cases
  the story can be delayed, and in all cases pertinent doubts should be
  expressed.  The final outcome should be publicized appropriately.  Finally,
  the setting in which a story is reported must be considered by a journalist.
  A story involving a prominent scientist in an inquiry on fraud is bound to
  make headlines, even if the story is only a question of judgement.  The late
  Senator Joseph McCarthy was particularly clever at manipulating journalists
  in this way; the techniques should be familiar by now.

  "Scientists respect integrity, scholarship, and good judgement as much as
  they abhor fraud, sloppiness, and poor judgement, but these are very
  different phenomena.  Those who mix them together in uncritical ways may
  decrease our chances of eliminating true fraud, may damage reputations
  unfairly, and may diminish enthusiasm for healthy differences of opinion at
  the cutting edge of science."

Yesterday I received an unsolicited package in the mail.  From the
source and the marking "magnetic media," I conclude that the package
contains a program sent to me for evaluation and review.

I am usually cautious about unsolicited mail.  However, this one came
with its own warning.  It was sealed with a sticker with the following
warning:  "The program on the enclosed disk is licensed to the user.  By
opening this package, you indicate your acceptance of the ENCLOSED
(emphasis mine) license agreement."  

Goodness!  What might I be agreeing to?  The fantasies are simply endless.

We use a number of 286 machines (American Research Corporation -made in
Taiwan) for some development work before uploading the code to an MVS/XA
environment.  REcently, one of the machines has given considerable trouble
and, indirectly, an insight into the obligations of the vendor we dealt
with.  The system unit emits quite a noticeable vibration which transmits
itself forcibly to the keyboard and desk - that problem has been there
from its purchase.  On several occasions the vendor has checked the unit
to ascertain the source of the vibration but to no avail.  Almost from
the start I mentioned that the vibration was bound to cause some damage
to the hard-disk in the long run (increased oscillation of the heads,etc).
In the last month one of the crimped connections to the hard-disk
controller board fell out with the result that drives C and D were not
recognised and some 30mb, it appeared were either lost or inaccessible.
I took the shroud off the unit and pushed home the connector - we lost two
recent files (yes, we have floppy backups).  A week later the same occured only 
but this time I couldn't locate any loose connections, so I rang the
vendor.  Firstly, he said he was too "busy" to come out, and then he
told me in a matter of fact manner that the hard-disk was probably corrupt
and all the data was lost.  We have had this machine *four* months.
He then proceeded to give a telephone analysis of what might have
happened.  Eventually, I was tiring and demanded that someone appear
quickly.  Two days later a technician came and once again it turned out
that a power connection to the the hard-disk had worked itself loose.
At this point, I decided that we should have a replacement machine.
No dice.  I was assured that the machine was in fine form.  A week later
the CMOS went sick and the hard-disk was inaccessible.  Once again 
a telephone analysis was conducted and I reconfigured the system.
I know this is getting long-winded but the point is that at no stage
in any of the exchanges did the vendor admit any liability, nor did
he seriously offer a replacement. This is of some concern to a number of
companies here in Ireland as quite a number of vendors have suffered
financial difficulties leaving their customers with pitiful after
sales support.  Are too many people getting into the VAR market by
the seat of their pants?

Really-from Tom Van Vleck

   SENT: 88-06-11  19:00
   FROM:2 VANVLECK_TOM @PRUNE

This may qualify as one of the oldest viruses: Just before the July 4th
holiday in 1966, two undergraduate CTSS users decided to write a RUNCOM (like
a shell script) which would invoke itself.  They knew that this would create a
new SAVED file on each invocation and eventually use all the disk space on the
Project MAC CTSS system, but they thought this would just lead to a documented
error return.  Unfortunately, there was a bug in the system and CTSS crashed.
Noel Morris and I spent a long time repairing the system disk tables by hand.
Well, was this a virus? The program launched a new copy of itself, and this
proliferation led to the death of the host.

(Note the early fascination with self-reference.  The other well-known way to
crash CTSS was to issue the XEC * instruction, which said "execute the
instruction at the location where this instruction is."  The 7094 CPU looped
taking I cycles only and couldn't be interrupted.  Bill Matthews once did this
deliberately to stop the system when an unwary system administrator
accidentally put the password file in the "message of the day."  Once again,
at 5PM Friday.)

The most important lesson is "don't get clever at 5PM Friday."

In reading Risks over the last couple years, I've noticed that responses to
attempts to complain about uncorrected technical problems tend to take
certain recurring forms.  John Pershing's message about ATMs illustrates a
remarkable number of these forms of argument, all of which will be familiar
from previous Risks discussions of related topics, such as privacy
violations and whistle-blowing at NASA.

What has happened?  Someone, in this case a customer though in other
cases it has often been an employee, complains that something is badly
amiss with some system, receives no redress, and finds that their
reports are ignored.  So they make noise about it.  The response?

1. Misplaced accusations of uncooperativeness.  `You have to exercise
the system so that the bugs will be found and fixed.'  The person
*has* exercised the system and discovered and reported difficulties
with it, but the organization in question ignored the reports and thus
(we must presume) neither found nor fixed any bugs.

2. Condescending lectures about how `incredibly complicated' the
systems in question are and how hard it is to anticipate all possible
problems.  Nobody has demanded that all problems be anticipated, only
that attempts be made to repair detected problems, especially ones
that cause unnecessary loss or injury.

3. Misplaced appeals to the market.  `If your bank is not responsive
to your bug reports, then find another bank.'  The ATM didn't just
have a bug, it stole this person's money.  And presumably it is
stealing other people's money.  Why doesn't the knowingly misdesigned
software constitute a company policy to defraud its customers?  And
don't ATMs, as a legal matter, fall under some version of the notion
of implied warranties of merchantability?

4. Casting misdesign as an irremediable act of God.  `It is quite
sensible for an ATM's programming to "lean" in the bank's direction is
there is something amiss ... .'  Wouldn't the really sensible thing be
to make a record, whether on a paper receipt or in a computer file,
and preferably both, that something was amiss in this particular
transaction?

5. Diagnosing the system is the victim's job.  `... the consumer will
always go complaining to a bank officer.  When was the last time that
you got *over*-changed and actually reported it?'  It is even more
sensible to "lean" in the customer's direction, because the bank will
always be motivated to fix problems that cost it money.  When was the
last time a bank discovered it had over-changed you and actually let
you keep the money?

6. This-is-nothing-new.  `I don't see any risks in his story that can
be attributed specifically to the use of ATMs, as opposed to the more
general use of a Bank.'  Such a statement requires that we define the
problem far too abstractly.  The story concerned a particular
misdesign.  Taking it as an abstract attack on ATMs misses the point.

7. Blaming the victim.  `It is impossible to even imagine ... the
number of ways that clever consumers can subvert the system.  Of
course, this is nothing new with ATMs -- financial fraud has been
around as long as banks.'  A customer gets defrauded, yet somehow the
issue has gotten twisted around into customers committing fraud.  Note
the irony of the last bit: banks have committed financial fraud as
long as there have been banks.

The ATM itself is not all that you need.  Baybanks in (Eastern) Massachusetts
has a dial-less telephone next to their ATMs, which reaches an office staffed
24 hours a day.  I have only used this phone for information, but I assume
that, if anything went wrong, it would be possible to inform someone and check
the state of the machine immediately.  If the bank decided to wait until
business hours to check the machine, they could still have a record of who
claimed to be short-changed.  These ATMs also have a camera behind glass
pointing at the customer, and although I never know when it's running, it seems
unlikely that someone would fake a complaint.  One pays for this convenience
with relatively high minimum balances and relatively low interest, but, as long
as I have the money, it's worth it.  (When I didn't have the money, I got a
better deal at a bank with only 2 branches that didn't offer ATMs at all, and a
check-cashing card in a 24-hour supermarket for emergencies.)

I suspect that the problem is less the machine than the attitude of the bank.
A bank should probably rather risk losing a little money than a lot of
customers, and I would boycott banks rather than ATMs if I boycotted at all.

Mary-Anne Wolf, MWolf -at BCO-Multics.ARPA, Honeywell Bull, Billerica MA
These opinions are my own, and my only connection with any bank is as a customer.

Organization: DCA Inc., Alpharetta, GA

&gt;From: John Pershing &lt;PERSHNG@ibm.com&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  -  I have never gotten a receipt for a failed transaction.  Requiring a
&gt;     receipt for a failed transaction sounds sort-of bogus to me, as one
&gt;     of the (dozens of) failures that can happen is that the receipt
&gt;     printer breaks or runs out of paper.

The ATMs around Atlanta always give you a receipt, whether or not your
request went through.  Usually they have a code on the front, with a list
of codes and what they mean on the back.

As for the printer breaking or running out of paper, it's not a hard thing
for an ATM to detect the lack of paper flow and put itself out of service.
Whether or not ATMs do that is yet another question.

Earlier, Karl Denninger relates that the bank told him "no receipt, no fix."
ATMs keep an internal printout of account numbers, as an audit trail.  It came
in handy for us a couple of years back when my wife deposited $400 in cash,
threw the receipt away, and the ATM crashed that evening and forgot to transmit
the transaction.  We didn't know what had happened until checks started
bouncing on us.  This safeguard must be on all machines; Georgia isn't much of
a consumer-oriented state to require that kind of special modification.

Additional details on the incident Dave Horsfall reported in RISKS DIGEST
7.8, from 'Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology,' June 13, p. 31:

  The most recent tests were conducted near a dense antenna field of nearly 1
  sq.  mi. that radiates on a broad range of frequencies with a power level
 
  potential well above 400 MW, according to Army officials.  During the tests,
  the aircraft experienced uncommanded rudder pedal movements that caused the
  UH-60 [Blackhawk] to begin turning, stiffness in the rudder pedals and
  illumination of caution and advisory lights in the cockpit.

  Specifically, the test UH-60 experienced a simultaneous loss of hydraulic
  pressure to both tail rotor servos for approximately 5 sec. and a jamming of
  the tail rotor control pedals.  Both malfunctions were attributed to the
  susceptibility of the hydraulic logic module to the high energy levels.  As a
  result, the service has decided to accelerate the hardening of the module for
  both production and retrofit as the first priority under the modified ECP
  [Engineering Change Proposal 384].

Ken Yap relates his problems with ^P and the Vax console.  Fortunately,
^P is not the standard rlogin escape.

Here's a better (worse?) one:  the console escape character on the CCI Power
6/32 ("tahoe") is the tilde.  And, so is the escape character for Berkeley
mail.  You guessed it... log in on the console, send some mail, and do a "~h"
to see the headers.... ooops, the machine just halted.

CCI also cleverly placed the "reboot" switch, an up/down toggle, on the
front of the cabinet, not recessed, and at knee level.  Fortunately,
UNIX seems to ignore the switch.

--Dave Curry

P.S. - Don't get me wrong; the tahoe is a really *nice* machine, regardless
       of the above demonstrations of poor design judgement.

This has taken on an almost urban legendary status in our group:

Four summers ago, we were doing a beta test at a customer site.
Our field support person had to remove some files in a directory, so
he had to use the "su" command.  This he did, followed by an rm -rf *

The problem was that he typed "su -" which moved him to the root
directory.  Not even a series of messages like "/bin/rm: Cannot remove,
file busy" detered him, until the machine was wiped out...

From "Computing Australia" 13 June 1988:

"System slip leads to danger dosage

 An error in instructions given to a pharmaceutical manufacturer's computer
 has resulted in the production of two dangerous batches of cough mixture.

 A spokesman for South Australian Hamilton Laboratories, which makes the
 Neo-Diophen Elixir, said during preparation of the master batch documents
 for the computer, a decimal placing was typed incorrectly [another decimal
 point error?].

 Some of the mixture was found to contain 10 times the normal level of a
 certain chemical, he said.  He said about 6,400 bottles of the mixture
 had left the laboratory, but less than half had reached retail outlets.

 The Federal Community Services and Health Department issued an instant
 recall on the batches and last week department inspectors were investigating
 the mistake."


So it's not the cough that carries you off, but the coffin they'll carry
you off in...

Recently I heard a litigation lawyer speak on the connection between insurance
premiums and corporate motivation.  He claimed that despite the shuttle disaster
Morton Thiokol still received a $65 Million dollar "early completion" bonus
on the contract that included the Challenger launch.  Is this true?  'Twere
scandalous 'twere so, but stranger (and sorrier) things have been known true.

Congressman Les Aspin (D - Wis.) is the chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee.  In an op-ed piece in the 28 Dec 88 'Los Angeles Times,' he writes
about the rarity of naval combat and about needed improvements in the Navy's
training, screening, and scheduling.  To make his case, he tells details from
the Vincennes' shootdown of an Iranian commercial jet last July:

  The crew was green when the battle began.  And it showed.  Despite all
  the training that the crew of the Vincennes received, the reality of 
  battle was something new and nerve-racking.  We can tell how nerve-
  racking it was from the unique electronic record kept by the Aegis 
  system aboard the Vincennes.  It recorded such details as the precise
  moment in which every button was touched and every toggle switched in
  the Vincennes' command center.
  
  Because of this record, we know that one officer, who was prompted by
  the computer to "select weapon system" as the countdown to the destruction
  of the Airbus began, hit the wrong buttons five times before he realized
  that he was supposed to select a weapon.  And we also know that another
  member of the Vincennes' crew was so agitated that he got ahead of the
  firing sequence and pushed another button 23 times before it was an
  appropriate part of the procedure.
  
  I don't recount these errors to pick on the crew.  I recount them because
  I believe that they much be considered the norm when inexperienced
  humans face a sudden stressful encounter.....

I found the following quote in the journal of Soren Kierkegaard for 1850.  As
this is the time of year we traditionally form our resolutions for the next, I
thought it might be helpful for us on the RISKS list to bung this into the
hopper for consideration.  The really good ideas never die; they just change
examples.

  "It is the old story.  A discovery is made--the human race triumphs;
  enthusiastically everything, everything is set going to perfect the
  discovery more and more.  The human race is jubilant and worships itself.
  At long last there comes a halt--man pauses and asks: is this discovery
  really a boon, especially the extraordinary perfection of it that has been
  achieved! Then a new call goes out for the most eminent heads, and they
  torture their brains almost to madness to find safety-valves, dampers,
  clogs, etc. in order, if possible, to put a brake on, to prevent this
  matchless and matchlessly perfected discovery, the pride of the human race,
  from riding roughshod over the whole world and destroying it.  Consider,
  for instance, the invention of the printing press, perfected to a top-speed
  machine sure to guarantee that no dirt or dregs remain unpublished."

In January 1988, Riverside, CA coroner's deputies obtained a warrant
to seize all the computers at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation.
This was done in connection with the widely reported cryonic
suspension of 83-year-old Dora Kent.  The coroner accused the Alcor
staff of murder, arguing that the cryonics procedure, where life
support and anesthesia/cooling is applied after legal death, is
murder, because resuscitation technology is applied without the intent
to revive the patient.

The deputies took six or seven computers ranging from an Apple II to
an Amiga, and have held them for the last 11 months.

Only one of these had a hard disk, so there wasn't much they
could get out of the computers anyway.  However, they did succeed
in making it much more difficult for Alcor to conduct business.

The computer with the hard disk was being used as a bulletin board.
Some 50 to 100 people had correspondence on the machine.  No warrants,
not even any "John Doe" warrants, were issued which would permit the
coroners, DAs, or the Riverside Police Department to access these
electronic communications in storage under the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act.  The ECPA requires that the particular
people whose communication is to be seized be named in the warrant,
similar to the warrants required to seize a person's postal mail.
This search warrant specified that "all electronic storage devices...
and the complete hardware necessary to retrieve electronic data" be
confiscated, not even naming Alcor, but simply giving the address of
their office.

Keith Henson (best known for founding the L5 Society, which encourages
the exploration of outer space) was one of the people whose email was
confiscated.  He complained to the FBI about his email being taken
without a warrant last April.  The FBI Riverside office inquired of
the US Attorney's office as to their interest in email, and, on
getting a "not interested," declined to investigate.  Henson tried
through his congressional representatives to get enforcement action
out of the Federal government against the various local law
enforcement agencies who had taken his email.

Finally, becoming convinced that this route was ineffective, Henson
and two other bbs users filed suit against the US Attorney's office
and the FBI.  One of the bbs users, Roger Gregory, is well known for
guiding project Xanadu, the proposed hypertext library system; the
other, Thomas Donaldson, has contributed two science fact articles to
Analog magazine in the last year.  The suit, "Complaint for
Declaratory Judgement" number C 88 20788, was filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California on December 9,
1988.

The crux of the matter is whether the ECPA prevents electronic mail
from being read if the entire computer containing the mail is seized
under a warrant.  If this is held true, the ECPA provides little or no
actual protection.  Consider the non-electronic or real-time
analogies; can a warrant that names no names be used to seize and read
all the mail in a building providing private post office boxes?  Can a
warrant claiming that someone is doing something illegal in a
telephone company office be used to tap all the subscribers' lines
going through that office?

A complete online copy of the suit (40 kbytes) is available as email
from keith@toad.com.  He can also send out hardcopies for the disabled,
or for people whose email has been seized.  The plaintiffs are:

A follow-up story to the Kevin Mitnick case [see RISKS 7.95] in the 'Los
Angeles Times' 24 Dec 88 says the federal magistrate refused to release Mitnick
on bail 23 Dec 88

  after prosecutors revealed new evidence that Mitnick penetrated a 
  National Security Agency computer and may have planted a false story 
  on a financial news wire....
  
  Investigators believe that Mitnick may have been the instigator of a
  false report released by a news service in April that Security Pacific
  National Bank lost $400 million in the first quarter of 1988.  The 
  report, which was released to the NY Stock Exchange and other wire
  services, was distributed four days after Mitnick had been turned 
  down for a job at Security Pacific [after the bank learned he had
  lied on a job application about his past criminal record]....  The 
  false information could have caused huge losses for the bank had it
  reached investors, but the hoax was uncovered before that could happen.
  
  The prosecutor said Mitnick also penetrated a NSA computer and obtained
  telephone billing data for the agency and several of its employees....
  
  [In refusing bail, the magistrate said,] "I don't think there's any
  conditions the court could set up based upon which the court would
  be convinced that the defendant would be anything other than a danger
  to the community.... It sounds like the defendant could commit major
  crimes no matter where he is."
  
  Mitnick's attorney said prosecutors have no evidence for the new
  accusations....

Re:    Observing Chaos Communication Congress 1988, Hamburg
       (`From Threat to Alternative Networks')
Date:  January 2nd, 1989

On 28-30 December, 1988, Computer Chaos Club (CCC) held its 5th annual `Chaos
Communication Congress' at Hamburg/FRG. As in previous years, 300 people
(mainly aged 16-36, 90% male, with some visitors from Austria and The
Netherlands) gathered, carefully observed from newsmedia (German stations,
printmedia, press agencies, but also from UK's BBC, and being observed by
Business Week's Katie Hafner, who gathered material for a book on hackers,
planned by John Markoff and herself).

In the chaotic (though creative) congress `organisation', two different tracks
were visible:

   -- technical presentations on networks (UUCP, GEONET, FIDONet,
      and CCCs emerging `open networks' BTXnet and `Zerberus'),
      and on a PC-DES encryption developed by a leading CCC member
      (who had escaped the French police's arrest by travelling
      to SECURICOM by railway while police waited at the airport);
      
   -- socio-political discussions about `sociology of hackers',
      `free flow of information' as well as reports about
      recent events, dominated by the arrest of Steffen Wernery
      in Paris in spring 88 when being invited to speak on SECURICOM.

The technical presentations were of mixed quality. The PC-DES program
(evidently written under the experience of several `visits' of German criminal
police on search for convicting material in cases of hacker attacks) encrypts
texts with a key of 8-40 characters, with a velocity of 135 characters/second
(on a 10 MHz 80286 processor); in a demonstration, the stored `Congress report'
of 137.416 Bytes was encrypted (without prior compression) in 2:55 minutes. The
recent version (V.2.02: about 8 kByte long including about 4 kByte of
help-text) was distributed at CCCongress as `Charity-ware' (for hackers free of
charge), but will be available for commercial users from German `Security
advisor' Hans Gliss at 250 DM (about 141 Dollars at actual exchange rates).

CCC speakers reported about their work to install `free networks'.  In Germany,
most of the networks are organised in the form of a `Verein' (an association
with legal status, which guarantees tax-free operation): such networks are
access-restricted to their members. The different German science and University
networks (and their bridges to international networks) usually restrict access
to scientists. Different CCC subgroups are establishing `alternative networks',
such as `EcoNet' for communication of ecological data and information, planned
to be available, free of cost, to broader social, ecological, peace and
political groups and individuals.

Apart from traditional technologies (such as GEONET and FIDONet), the German
Post Office's Bildschirmtext (Btx) will be used as a cheap communications
medium; while CCCs first hack was, years ago, to attack the `insecure
Btx-system' (in the so-called `HASPA coup' where they misused the Btx passwork
of the Hamburg savings bank to repeatedly invoke CCC's Btx information at a
total prize of 135.000 DM, then about 50.000$), they today begin to use this
cheap though very limited medium while more powerful communications media are
available. Today, the emerging ISDN technology is verbally attacked by hackers
because of the excessive accumulation of personal data; from here, hacks may be
attempted when ISDN becomes regionally available in 1989/90.

Several speakers, educated Informaticians with grades from West German
Informatics departments, professionally work in Software production and in
selling hardware/software to economy and state agencies. Among them, several
professional UNIX and UUCP users have begun to organize CCC's future UUCP
version. Up to now, only few CCC members use (and know about) UNIX systems, but
their number may grow within the near future according to CCCs `marketing'.
One speaker told the audience `that you can remotely start programs in UUCP'.
After some learning phase, the broadened availability of UNIX in the hacker
scene may produce new threats.

The other track of the Congress discussed themes like `sociology of hackers'
where a group of politology students from Berlin's Free University analysed
whether hackers belong to the `new social movements' (e.g. groups on peace,
nuclear energy, feminist themes).  They found that, apart from much public
exaggeration ('it is not true that hackers can invade *any* computer'), hackers
are rather `unpolitical' since they are preferably interested in technology.

A major topic was `free access to/flow of information'. Under the title
'freedom of information act', speakers suggested a national legislation which
guarantees individual and group rights to inspect files and registers of
`public interest'; the discussion lacked sufficient basic knowledge, e.g. of
the respective US legislation and corresponding international discussions in
Legal Informatics.  Generally, the published results of the rich discussions
about `Social aspects of Computing', gathered in professional bodies (like ACMs
SIGCAS, IFIPs TC-9 or the German national society's FA-8, all devoted to such
themes) are evidently unknown to this scene.

Summarising the Congress and accompanying discussions, active CCC members try
hard to demonstrate that they have *no criminal goals* and ambitions (they
devoted a significant amount of energy to several press conferences, TV
discussions etc). The conference was dominated by young computer professionals
and students from the PC scene, partially with good technological knowledge of
hardware, software and networks; while some people seem to have good technical
insights in VAXsystems, knowledge of large systems seems to be minimal. To some
extent, the young professionals wish to behave as the `good old-fashioned
hackers': without criminal energy, doing interesting work of good professional
quality in networks and other new areas.

While former CCCongresses were devoted to threats like Viruses, *no explicit
discussion* was devoted *to emerging threats*, e.g. in ISDN or the broadening
use of UNIX, UUCP. The new track discussing political and social aspects of
computing follows former discussions about `hacker ethics'. Here, the
superficial, unprofessional discussions of related themes show that the young
(mainly) males are basically children of a `screen era' (TV, PCs) and of an
education which concentrates on the visible `image', rather than understanding
what is behind it.

(A 140 KBytes electronic Congress news`paper' can be mailed, on demand,
to people who are interested in details; the papers, of mixed quality,
are mainly written in German)

	Personal XXXXX's

Not many years ago, there were three kinds of typing and each sent its own
message.  Letters from a genuine V.I.P. were written on an elegant electric
typewriter, with a carbon ribbon that printed sharp black letters.  Letters
from lesser lights were written on manual machines, nicely arranged and error-
free, but distinguishable by the grainy impressions of a fabric ribbon.  Then
there were the personal letters, in which strikeovers and xxxxx's demonstrated
the exclusivity of the correspondence.

Now the word processor has erased this typology of typewriting.  The early
home printers with their coarse san-serif characters are yielding to new
machines, including laser-jet printers, that make the layman's letters look
like the elegant V.I.P. correspondence of old.

That's probably progress, but it comes at a cost.  There's no telling, any-
more, whether such a letter is personal.  Once, you could discern from the
typographical errors whether the annual chatty holiday letter was meant just
for you, or for the whole Christmas list.  Not anymore, not when home compu-
ters can "personalize" a mass mailing by changing the salutation and a tell-
tale fact or two and printing it up beautifully.

The tide of progress, in other words, sometimes flows backward.  There's
probably only one sure way now to write letters that are, and look, personal:
by hand.

	High-Tech Junk Mail

After installing a facsimile machine, many offices soon discover a byproduct
of this high-tech communications form --- junk fax mail.  When a facsimile
machine is left on, anyone with access to the machine's telephone number is
free to send documents to the machine, just as anyone with access to a postal
address can send mail there.

Now Digital Publications of Norcross, Ga., has come up with a program and a
data base that can be used with a specially equipped personal computer to send
press releases en masse by facsimile machine.  Late at night, when telephone
long-distance rates are lowest, the computer and its facsimile-machine circuit
board will automatically dial telephone numbers all over the country, sending
out press releases.

Executives of Digital Publications contend that after 11 P.M. their system can
deliver a news release for 10 cents.  They said that a news release sent
through the mail costs about 80 cents.  Mail rates keep going up, of course,
and delivery can take two or three days, or longer.

The Digital Publications system data base has 5,000 names and addresses of
newspapers, broadcast stations, trade magazines and writers.  Also --- and
this is crucial --- it has each outlet's fax number.

But the new technology must still overcome the same hurdle that confronts
the old technology of sending an envelope through the mails --- getting the
recipient to read the material.

Clive Feather, a former contributor to Risks currently off the net but "soon to
be clive@isi.co.uk", has sent me some information about the train crash at
Clapham Junction in London last month.  I have posted a longer version to
Usenet's rec.railroad, but here's the meat.

Clive writes:

#  The BR internal enquiry found that there were no faults in the
#  signalling equipment as such, but a member of the S&amp;T [Signals and
#  Telecommunications] department had failed to correcly tie off a loose
#  cable end.  This was making intermittent contact with a signalling
#  structure (i.e. earth) and this in turn caused the preceding
#  signals to continually vary in aspect.  Presumably the driver ...
#  was only looking at the wrong moment.
#  
#  There will not be a normal enquiry and report.  Instead, there will be
#  a full judicial enquiry, something that up to now has only happened
#  twice -- Tay Bridge [1897] and Hixon [~1968].
#  
#  I expect the February Modern Railways [magazine] will be full of this.

COMPUTER-RELATED ACCIDENT RESULTS IN WOMAN'S DEATH

JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA, 1988 DEC 28 (NB) -- According to the Associated
Press, a South African woman was killed Tuesday in a freak computer-room
accident. The death occurred when 1 1/2-ton steel doors closed on Renata Espach
as she stood in their path but out of sight of optical sensors intended to
detect obstructions. The accident took place at the computer facilities of
Liberty Life in Johannesburg as the 23-year-old woman was handing a document to
a colleague in the course of her employment.

  R. P. Feynman in his recent book "What do you care what other people
  think" adapted a Buddist (possibly Shinto, I can't remember) story to
  explain dangers and benefits of technology.  His explanation went something
  like this:  There is a key that opens the gate of heaven and it's the same
  key that opens the gate of hell.  The two gates cannot be distinguished from
  the outside and the only way to tell which is which is to open it.
  Obviously, it's very desirable to have this key because it allows us to
  experience wonderful things, but there's also the risk of hell.  That key is
  technology.

I am not surprized by these relevations.  I have observed the same behavior
from my son when he is playing a video game on the computer.  Once people get
into these games, it is as if it was real, as if their life was threatened by
whatever scenario is there.  Perhaps games of that sort based on the particular
equipment and expected mission could be used both in the development of systems
to find out what strange things people will do under pressure, and to help
train the eventual users to understand how to respond when those pressures do
occur.

of a panel discussion about the use of computers in U.S. politics.  The other
guest on the show was a gentleman from a large direct mail firm which
specializes in mailings for political causes and candidates.  He brought along
some of his samples to show us how sophisticated mailings are becoming.  One of
them was particularly interesting:  the mailing was sent out to about three
quarters of a million senior citizens in the state of Arizona.  It had to do
with some kind of issue that had an impact on senior citizens, and the polls
indicated the vote was likely to be close (direct mail can make the difference
only when votes are close).  The direct mail company had developed a mail-merge
program using handwriting instead of formed characters, and then had these
letters printed on vast machines that actually wrote out the letters with
high-speed pens, I gathered, so that the final product was virtually
indistinguishable from a handwritten letter.  The stationery the letters were
printed on had only a person's name and home address at the top of the page, as
if it were personal stationery.  The envelopes were printed with the same
handwriting sample and the same process so they appeared to be hand-addressed.
The company even went so far as to affix the stamps (first class of course) on
the outside of the envelope with a jig that rocked back and forth in a frame so
the stamp would only rarely be glued on exactly straight up and down.  

This gentleman from the direct mail company told us proudly that the campaign
headquarters had received something like 14,000 telephone calls the first day
after this mail was delivered, and the election was turned in their client's
favor.

I looked at his sample letters and envelopes and could eventually tell that
these were computer-generated.  But I would not expect senior citizens, who
typically don't imagine that technology is capable of simulating a hand-written
letter so well, to be so discriminating.  I would bet that a large majority of
the recipients were convinced they had received a letter that someone had
painstakingly written to them in a very personal fashion.

Kevin Mitnick, earlier characterized as "armed with a keyboard and
considered dangerous" [see RISKS 7.95] is the subject of a lengthy profile
by John Johnson in the 8 Jan 89 'Los Angeles Times', with the headline:

             Computer an 'Umbilical Cord to His Soul'
	 'DARK SIDE' HACKER SEEN AS 'ELECTRONIC TERRORIST'

When a friend turned him in and Mitnick asked why, the friend replied,
"Because you're a menace to society."  Mitnick is described as 

   25, an overweight, bespectacled ... computer junkie known as a 
   'dark side' hacker for his willingness to use the computer as a 
   weapon.... whose high school computer hobby turned into a lasting
   obsession .... He allegedly used computers at schools and businesses
   to break into Defense Dept. computer systems, sabotage business 
   computers and electronically harass anyone -- including a probation
   officer and FBI agents -- who got in his way.  He also learned how
   to disrupt telephone company operations and disconnected the phones
   of Hollywood celebrities such as Kristy McNichol, authorities said.
   
   So determined was Mitnick, according to friends, that when he suspected
   his home phone was being monitored, he carried his hand-held keyboard 
   to a pay phone in front of a 7-Eleven store, where he hooked it up and
   continued to break into computers around the country.  "He's an electronic
   terrorist, said [the friend who turned him in], "He can ruin someone's 
   life just using his fingers."
   
   Over the last month, three federal court judges have refused at separate
   hearings to set bail for Mitnick, contending there would be no way to 
   protect society from him if he were freed.... Mitnick's lack ofconscience,
   authorities say, makes him even more dangerous than hackers such as Robert 
   Morris Jr., ... who is suspected of infecting computer systems around the 
   country with a "virus" that interfered with their operations.
   
   Mitnick's family and attorney accuse federal prosecutors of blowing the 
   case out of proportion, either out of fear or misunderstanding of the
   technology.  

The story details his "phone phreak" background, and his use of high school
computers to gain access to school district files on remote computers, where
he didn't alter grades, but "caused enough trouble" for administrators and
teachers to watch him closely.  He used the name `Condor,' after a Robert
Redford movie character who outwits the government.  The final digits of his
unlisted home phone were 007, reportedly billed to the name "James Bond."

   [He and a friend] broke into a North American Air Defense Command
   computer in Colorado Springs in 1979.... [The friend] said they did not
   interfere with any defense operation.  "We just got in, looked around,
   and got out."....

   What made Mitnick "the best" said a fellow hacker and friend, was his 
   ability to talk people into giving him privileged information....
   He would call an official with a company he wanted to penetrate and say 
   he was in the maintenance department and needed a computer password.  He
   was so convincing, they gave him the necessary names or numbers....

   He believed he was too clever to be caught.  He had penetrated the DEC
   network in Mass. so effectively that he could read the personal electronic
   mail of security people working on the case of the mysterious hacker and
   discover just how close they were getting to him.  But caught he was, again
   and again.... 
   
   Mitnick's motive for a decade of hacking?  Not money, apparently....
   Friends said he did it all simply for the challenge....  [His one-time
   probation officer says,] "He has a very vindictive streak.  A whole
   bunch of people were harassed.  They call me all the time." .... His
   mastery of the computer was his "source of self-esteem," said a friend.

From the Jan. 89 issue of The Institute (a supplement to IEEE Spectrum),
in an IEEE article by Tekla Perry:

  Saratoga, CA- Some 200 personal computer industry pioneers and current
  innovators met here Oct. 7-9 for the invitation-only fourth annual Hackers
  Conference...

  "Hackers," as defined by this group, are "artists of technology," people who
  "derive joy from discovering ways to circumvent limitations," or more
  simply, those who are willing to "hack at that computer keyboard until the
  computer does what you want it to."

[Note that people invited to the Hackers Conference include people like
Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates, Mitch Kapor, etc. (as well as CBS!). Imagine their
surprise when , according to the article:]

  CBS... seemed not to have taken the point. Its Oct. 8 national report led
  with these words: "A small revolutionary army is meeting in the hills above
  California's Silicon Valley this weekend, plotting their next attack on the
  valley below..."

I hold a more elementary definition of "hacker". One that was applicable in the
early days and remains so. Very simply, a hacker is one who is keenly
interested in the full capabilities of a system. This implies that
experimenting is done to discover the undocumented features, the limits of the
controls, and the back doors that should not exist. This was and can be done in
a constructive way. This was and can be done in a malicious, irresponsible way.

We, as computer professionals have, then, two responsibilities. First, we must
begin to think of malicious hacking as socially unacceptable. This should not
require the demise of hacking (according to my definition) altogether. The
perpetrator of misdirected hacking must not be rewarded for his or her efforts.
As colleagues of the irresponsible hackers, we must view them with distaste for
they will destroy the profession.

Second, a system of licensing should be implemented. This need not be (but
could be) a knowledge certification. A general form of permission granted to
all who request it would suffice. This license can then be revoked or suspended
upon conviction of some computer related offense. The license number would be
put on resumes, employers would demand new employees to have valid licenses,
and the future of ones career would hinge upon keeping that license intact.

The public has a right and, unfortunately, a need to regulate computer related
activity that affects the public. Some sort of licensing proclaims that society
agrees that this person is trustworthy (so far).  Mr. Morris, Jr. would not, in
my eyes, be eligible to receive a license to practice his trade.

The analogy between computer viruses and medical viruses is appropriate.
Medical researchers are required to use approved methods for biological
research.  The leverage enacting those requirements comes in the form of:
licensing by a medical board with a list of expectations, laws that protect the
public's safety, and even laws that protect animal rights.

There is nothing to stop a researcher from suddenly going mad and applying his
or her knowledge for malicious purposes.  There is incentive to follow socially
approved channels for conducting legitimate research - fear of losing one's
license or being criminally charged. With these mechanisms and laws in place,
the public has a means to deal with malicious researchers who ignore the rights
of others.

&gt; Date: Wed, 21 Dec 88 09:23:26 est
&gt; From: Henry Cox  &lt;cox@spock.ee.mcgill.ca&gt;
&gt; Subject: Supercomputer used to "solve" math problem (<A HREF="/Risks/7.97.html">RISKS-7.97</A>)

The "Montreal Gazette" errs by espousing the false belief that solving "a
theoretical mathematics problem so complex that it is beyond the capability of
the human mind to comprehend" implies, first, that scientists must "accept the
supercomputer's solution more or less on faith"; and second, that the proof is
not fully understandable for verification purposes.  The necessary and
sufficient condition for verifying a proof is ensuring that each step in the
derivation of the final result is valid -- i.e., follows from formal
definitions, postulates, rules, and validly derived results (i.e., lemmas
and/or theorems).  However, that condition is neither necessary nor sufficient
for understanding the problem: One can, trivially, logically derive a result
that one does not "comprehend"; and inversely, one can comprehend a result,
whether it is true or false, for which no derivation is known --e.g., P being a
strict subset of NP, or Fermat's "Last Theorem"-- or for which no derivation
exists -- e.g., Godel's reflexive assertion of not being a theorem.  The only
faith required to verify any proof is faith in, first, the logical system on
which the verification is based; and second, the verification's valid stepwise
application of that logical system.  Summarily, one not only can, but logically
must, accept the result of validly applying valid logic to premises that one
accepts, regardless of the extent to which (s)he "comprehends" the result.

Now, if my information that the (non-)existence of a finite projective plane of
order 10 does not qualify as "a theoretical mathematics problem so complex that
it is beyond the capability of the human mind to comprehend" is correct --which
seems likely, given that humans programmed the computer to (dis)prove it-- then
the article was blatantly inaccurate in characterizing the problem as
incomprehensible.  However, whether or not the argument was thus falsely
predicated, its logic was, as proven in the immediately preceding paragraph
above, invalid -- and non-trivially so, as Mr.  Cox's above inferences
therefrom demonstrate.

In response to Mr. Cox's terminal (parenthetic) sentence

&gt; [ The RISKS are obvious. The willingness of people to accept a computer's
&gt; answer on faith (whether at the cash register at the grocery store or in the
&gt; university environment) remains disturbing.  		          Henry Cox]

it would be disturbingly anti-progressive of people to continue to trust human
operators more than non-human machines to perform tasks (e.g., tabulating
grocery bills, and operating switching networks) that these machines have
proven themselves superior to humans at executing.

Verifiably yours,                                  -- John C. Bazigos

P.S. Given that the earth's present population is less than 5 billion; it
follows that 1 quadrillion possibilities represents 200,000 possibilities per
person -- which is 4 times the above article's claim of 50,000 per person.

"DISASTER BECOMES A MATTER OF ROUTINE

There is no pattern to the proliferation of disasters. Lockerbie was a 
bomb on a middle-aged jet, blown to pieces high over a Scottish town.
Flight BD-92 was a spanking new jet which somehow (inevitable speculation)
seems to have contrived to lose both engines limping in to land at 
Castle Donington. No suggestion of a bomb, though the flight was Belfast-
bound; and --- compared to the carnage of Lockerbie --- enormous strokes of
good fortune. You cannot, surveying the debris strewn across the M1 (freeway),
quite visualise how so many passengers survived, nor calcualte the odds
against the doomed Boeing ploughing into a string of cars and lorries;
nor those against fire engulfing the scene.

In a way, the horror of BD-92, like Clapham Junction, like King's Cross
even, is easier to come to terms with. It was justone of those things: 
mechanical (or, possibly, human error.) Inquiries may be conducted, 
reports published. There are things that can be done. Engines to be checked.
Software to be scrutinised. Training to be tightened. And, beyond such 
simple reactions, of course, there will be more political questions. 
How rigorous and independent are Civil Aviation Authority checks? Do 
they take too much for granted, because the FAA has already pronounced
an aircraft safe? Have all the lessons of Manchester been learned and
acted upon? What are the risks for two engined planes? We have been
constantly informaed that the chances of both engines failing are 
millions to one, so that such airliners now cross the Atlantic as a
matter of routine. But the odds may have shortened somewhat over 
Kegworth on Sunday night.

There is a broader sense, though, in which the M1 disaster brings no
comfort at all. It was a failure of technology; or maybe some element
of human incapacity to deal with technology. There is supposed reassurance
in hi-tech. The machines take over, to blind-land a jumbo, or put man
into space. Eliminate human error. Leave it to the computers. But that
is too blithe. Week after week, month after month, hi-tech planes
fall out of the sky. Because they are military jets, and fall usually
into the sea or on some deserted hillside, they do not command the 
headlines. (Though when, as a few weeks ago, they plough into the centre
of a West German town, all that changes). They are not safer because of
their extreme sophistication; on the contrary, they are dangerous because
human beings, no matter how relentlessly trained, are not sophisticated
enough to command their infinite complexity. And so, in civil aviation too,
the new, replacing the middle aged, does not automatically spell greater safety.

We must, in short, begin to budget for disaster. Watch the jets stacked 
over Heathrow or Gatwick and there is a feeling of living dangerously, of
disasters waiting to happen. As they occur, they will not necessarily
alter the basic calculations. It will still, statistically, be safer to 
take a flight to New York, than your car for a Sunday spin. The growth
in air traffic cannot be checked; nor can the demand for new, more
complex planes. There is, here, a sense of challenge. Airports within 
a few hundred yards of motorways; jets wheeling to land over cities.
Lockerbie and Castle Donington are very different cases, united only
by their fear and pity. The odds against them happening with a handful
of days, like the odds against two engines failing, were millions to
one. But disaster, it seems, has a way of rendering odds meaningless."

From the 24 Dec 88 issue of the Washington Post comes an article about yet
another failed software development project. 

The system was to disburse child support payments for the State Dept. of
Social Services...The state paid $4.5 M for the system in 1985...  problems
with the system caused delays up to six months in issuing payments...

The state is now seeking a completely new system [now that it has figured
out its requirements, apparently] for $10M, to be installed in two years.

The article further states: "the state bought Unisys' proposed package outside
of normal competive bidding practices, a move a state auditors' report later
found was made in an 'atmosphere of panic and haste'...welfare officials never
checked to see if the system would do what the company promised."

It appears that the state officials involved didn't exercize the kind of
management care that a more routine non-technical procurement would have
received.

eelskin wallets have dropped as wary consumers boycott the alleged mag strip

This item appeared in Business Week Nov 28, 1988:

                                Electronic Gun

  Colt industries Inc has filed for US and European patents on a handgun with
  an electronic firing system.  Pulling the trigger would move a magnet past
  the solid state switch, triggering a circuit that releases the hammer.  It
  would be more reliable and cheaper than mechanical systems, says the company.
  In addition, putting chips in pistols would make it possible to add a digital
  display that warns when the gun is loaded and shows how many shots are left.
  And that could just be the beginning of new "user friendly" features for
  tomorrow's firearms.

Now, I'm not a "hardware type" (maybe they're thinking of microcoding the gun
:-)?), but after reading recent RISKS articles that discuss such things as
electromagnetic interference with army helicopters, etc., it seems that the
risks attendant with the device described above should be prohibitive.  This
firearm design seems just plain absurd!

Other points: whatever happened to the tried-and-true engineering philosophy
of "simplest best"?  An electronic firing system in a handgun seems, say,
Rube Goldberg-ish, yes?  Furthermore, with your little digital display, all
the excitement of playing Russian Roulette would disappear.

Subject: Unused city computer system set aside after 4 years, $4 million
Organization: Institute for Research on Higher Education, Univ. of Pennsylvania

The following article comes from the 6 January 1989 (Friday) Philadelphia
Inquirer, front page.  In this city where the government is widely criticized
on every front, it raises questions of incompetence and poor management.  It
also, however, raises questions about whether cities out to be involved in
software development.

   Unused city computer system set aside after 4 years, $4 million
   By Dan Meyers, Inquirer Staff Writer

   After at least $4 million in expenses and more than four years of
frustration, the City of Philadelphia has shelved a computer system it bought
-- but never used.  Officials in the Finance Department had pitched the system
in the early 1980s as an efficient way to track information on payroll,
pensions and personnel.
   "Has it worked?" City Councilman John F. Street asked at a hearing this
week.
   "No it has not," said Deputy Finance Director Peter A. Certo, the latest
supervisor of the project.  Certo said the total cost has been at least $4
million.  Street put it at $5 million.  The system now is in storage.
   For the current fiscal year, which began in July, the Finance
Department had budgeted more than $400,000 for a 13-member team to work
on the computer system.

* In May, however, with Mayor [Wilson] Goode facing a $79 million budget
deficit and calling for a cut of 2,000 people in the city workforce, Finance
director Betsy C. Reveal decided to put the program on hold indefinitely.  She
did not respond to requests for comment.
   "We didn't really scrap it," said Certo.  "We put it on the back burner."
   Records in the city controller's office show the project was scuttled by
mid-September.  The failure of the system was mentioned Wednesday in a hearing
on another matter of the Appropriations Committee, which Street chairs.
"Council members really though we'd been burned" on the Finance Department
project, Street said.

* [Overall problems with city funding finally brought the computer
system's development to a halt.]

   The computer tapes, programs and consultant reports have been put in storage
and could be "resurrected" when the city can afford to pursue them, Certo said.
Certo said the problem was that it was difficult to adapt a computer system to
the myriad peculiarities of the city.  And he said it would have taken
additional staff and money to get the computer system working.  According to
Certo, the project was underfunded from the start.  When it was mothballed, the
computer program was at least six months away from working, Certo said.
   Others were skeptical of the ability of such departments as Finance to
oversee complicated computer projects.  "Systems like this are difficult to
install and should be left to professionals to do," said Eugene L. Cliett Jr.,
director of the Philadelphia Computing Center, an office created by Goode to
oversee city computer projects.
   The computer project was under discussion at least as early as 1982, under
the administration of Mayor William J. Green, according to controller records.
   The plan was to take a software package -- computer programs already
designed by a company -- and modify it to the city's particular needs.  The
city chose not to order a custom-designed computer system because the cost
would have been double or triple, Certo said.
   By early 1984, the city had entered into a $1.4 million contract with
American Management Systems to develop a computer system that would combine, in
easily digestible form, data on city employees.
   "Time is of the essence," the contract said.
   Numerous consulting contracts followed, totalling at least $214,000,
according to controller records.  Much of the rest of the cost was for
city staff assigned to the project.
   The system initially was to include information on three areas --
payroll, pensions and personnel.  All had, and still have, separate
computer systems.  The pension board pulled out of the project shortly
after it began.
   "We have a system now that is 30 years old and it pays people every week but
doesn't give us a lot of management information we'd like to have," Certo said.
The computer system that was supposed to cure that problem was slow in taking
shape, however.  "We spent two years modifying the package and in the course of
that period found things we felt wer not addressed adequately by AMS," Certo
said.  At one point, he said, the list of problems was at least 85 items long.
   AMS consultants began to phase out of the work and the city Finance
Department took it over.  But one department or another objected to the
results, Certo said.  "We were constantly changing things," he recalled.  "We
tried to accommodate everyone."
   Finally, in the city budget crunch, Reveal decided to abandon the
long-standing project, at least for the moment.
   So at a time when the city could most use precise information that
could help the city run more efficiently, the Goode administration has
determined that it cannot afford to pay for it.
   "You're damned if you do and damned if you don't," Certo said.  "We
decided not to do it."

I was at the Hackers' Conference whose blatantly slanted news coverage was
recently reported in The Institute and Risks.  I created a transcript of the
CBS news segment the evening it was aired; it is below.  Reading it is
interesting; while CBS never lied, they juxtaposed material from different
sources to make a strong impression that we were criminals.  Note in particular
what was happening on the screen while various things were said (e.g. showing a
"combat" video game while talking about us as revolutionaries, showing Cliff
Stoll giggling about mice and playing with a Yo-Yo).  BTW, there *was* the
obligatory shot of tape drives, I seem to recall.

CBS was given special access in order to film the conference; the rest of the
press was only allowed there on Sunday.  Needless to say they will NOT be
invited back (and I will personally escort them off the property even if they
show up on Sunday).  Unfortunately, that's not enough. The producer of the show
guaranteed that the attendees' image of hacking, rather than the distorted,
media-generated image of hacking, would be presented.  He broke that promise,
with a vengence, but boycotting CBS won't help.  (Fred Peabody produced the
Hackers coverage.  He went to ABC, working on 20/20, according to Glenn Tenney,
who ran the Hackers Conference.  Be sure you don't let him *near* anything you
are doing -- if you want fair and unbiased coverage.)

	Transcript of CBS News segment on the Hackers Conference
		filmed 7 Oct 88, aired 8 Oct 88.

Anchorman ("High Technology" logo and drawing of chip):  An unusual
conference is under way near San Francisco.  The people attending it
are experts on a technology that intimidates most of us, but has changed
the way we live.  John Blackstone reports.

Narrator (trees and outdoor scenes at conference):  A small revolutionary
army is meeting in the hills above California's Silicon Valley this
weekend, plotting their next attacks on the valley below, the heart
of the nation's computer industry.  They call themselves computer hackers.

Jonathan Post:  "The people who are gathered here changed the world
once; if we can agree on where to go next, we're gonna change it again."

Narr (conference scenes, blinking lights):  What hackers have learned
to do with computers has changed the world, for both good and bad. 
They're the people who dreamed of and built the personal computer industry.
But the same kind of talent is creating never before dreamed-of crime.
Because for a computer, the only difference between a hundred and a
million is a few zeros.

Donn Parker, (SRI International, in office):  "And so, in fact, criminals
today I think have a new problem to deal with: and that is how much
should I take.  They can take any amount they want."

Narr  (phone central office):  Telephone companies are the most victimized
because those who break into phone company computers can link up for
free to computers around the world.

Richard Fitzmaurice (Pacific Bell, in office):  "You'll hear the term
computer hacker, computer cracker; we call them computer criminals."

Narr (blinking lights):  But much more frightening are the hackers
who crack American military computers.  Earlier this year in a lab that
does some classified research, astronomer Clifford Stoll discovered
someone had broken into his computer.  He says it was like finding a
mouse running across the floor.

Stoll (in office):   "You watch and you see, he's going in that hole
over there, and you say, ooh, he's going in that hole; that connects
to a network that goes to a military computer, in Okinawa."

Narr (Stoll playing with a yo-yo in a machine room):   The breakins
to American military computers went on for several months.  Eventually
Stoll traced them to a hacker in West Germany.

Donn (in office):  "A hacker today is an extremely potentially dangerous
person.  He can do almost anything he wants to do in your computer."

Narr (at conference, video games, stabbing and fighting on screen):  But at
the hackers' camp in the hills, there's recognition that in any
revolutionary army there will be a few rogues and criminals.  But that's no
reason, they say, to slow down the revolution.

An article in the Boston Globe on January 2, 1989 describes the use of 
digital technology to retouch or drastically alter photographs, with results 
that show no evidence of the fact that alterations were done. The article 
said: "The 80's are fast becoming the last decade in which photos can be 
considered evidence of anything." It pointed out that the only confidence we 
can have in these digital photographs relies upon the ethics of the people 
who use the machines. In response to the question: "What about the ethics of 
all this?" a vendor of the technology is quoted as answering: "That's up to 
you." George Wedding of the Sacramento Bee is quoted as saying: "I hope that 
10 years from now readers will be able to pick up a newspaper and magazine 
and believe what they read and see. Whether we are embarking on a course 
which will make that impossible, I don't know. I'm afraid we have."

This is not the first time I've read about this technology, and every article 
I've read has raised the concern that the new technology renders inoperative 
a very basic assumption made by society (and the law, in particular) since 
the development of photographic technology; namely, that a photograph can be 
considered to be reliable evidence. Until recently, it was virtually 
impossible to alter a photograph without leaving evidence of the alteration; 
physical evidence was available to confirm or deny the authenticity of the 
photo. With digital photos, this is no longer true.

The article reminded me, however, of a more basic concern I have regarding 
the use of computer technology. Computer technology has had the following 
impacts upon record-keeping:

1) The use of electronic storage to eliminate physical storage (e.g., 
paper) of information has certain clear benefits, but has also 
eliminated reliable records of that information, because electronic 
storage media can be altered without leaving any evidence of alteration. 
Electronic records cannot be considered to be as reliable as physical 
records (certainly not today, and perhaps not ever). The best we can do 
is provide a combination of physical security and software controls to 
attempt to assure the reliability of records; and as we all know, 
software controls are not all that reliable and in any case can be 
circumvented, often with the greatest of ease.

2) Computer technology renders the task of altering electronic records 
extremely easy. Forgery has been a problem ever since written records 
were first used. But before computer technology was used to store and 
manipulate records, few people were capable of forging records well 
enough to fool anyone else -- forgery of physical records requires a 
considerable skill, possessed by relatively few people. Successful 
alteration and forgery of electronic records, however, requires 
considerably less skill -- and the skill it does require is usually one 
that a large number of people possess: the ability to use a computer.

3) Computer technology has made it practical to store and manipulate far 
larger volumes of information than could be handled with prior 
technology. We have no practical means of verifying the integrity of 
such large volumes of information, and are thus left with no choice but 
to trust that the electronic records are accurate. It is wholly 
impractical, for example, for the Social Security Administration's 
entire data base (how many hundreds of millions of individual records?) 
to be manually audited to verify its accuracy.

What bothers me is the combination of factors: the electronic storage of the 
information makes it very easy to carry out successful alterations and 
forgeries, and the volume of information makes it practically impossible to 
verify the authenticity of the information. As we put more kinds of 
information under the control of computer technology, it seems to me that we 
make it ever more difficult to trust the authenticity of information. 
Computer technology has the potential (and is in fact beginning to realize 
that potential) to destroy the very important and fundamental concept that 
truth is ascertainable from physical evidence.

Are we approaching the point (or have we reached it already?) where truth is, 
for all practical purposes, whatever the computer says it is? Where what is 
accepted as truth is easily manipulated by those who are privileged to have 
access to the digital keepers of truth?

We observe a bit of this phenomenon in advertising (commercial and 
political), where public perception of truth is subtly manipulated by images 
and propaganda; and to that extent, this is not a phenomenon peculiar to 
computer technology. But most of us are at least aware that advertising is on 
the face of it an attempt to persuade us to believe a certain thing, and thus 
that its appearance of "truth" is not to be taken at face value. We at the 
same time continue to believe that facts are facts, and that there are 
reliable ways to permanently record objective truth.

The computer is depriving us of the ability to authenticate that which is 
purportedly a recording of objective truth. What will the impact be upon 
society when we come to understand that we can no longer trust those forms of 
evidence that we have so long taken for granted to be reliable? When an 
authentic-looking photograph shows something that may or may not have 
actually existed? When an apparently authentic sound recording reproduces 
sounds that may or may not have actually occurred? When a corporation's 
audited and verified financial records describe financial activities that may 
or may not have ever occurred?

Not that these are really new threats: individuals have for a long time 
attempted to falsify all kinds of records. But in times past, it has been so 
difficult to succeed at forgery that we have been confident that a forgery 
could be detected. That confidence leads to the confidence that if a physical 
record passes all authenticity tests, it is indeed a reliable record.

Computer technology has destroyed this confidence. Where are the authenticity 
tests for electronic records? Is it ever possible for us to have the same 
high degree of confidence in electronic records that we have in physical 
records? I understand software too well to suppose that today's software 
technology is capable of supporting really trustworthy verification of the 
authenticity of electronic records, and I'm not convinced that software can 
ever be trustworthy enough to achieve the level of reliability possessed by 
physical records. But does that mean that we shouldn't use computer 
technology to manage information? How do we in the computer industry deal 
with this problem?

               A Digital Matter of Life and Death
                        by Ivars Peterson
                   Science News, 12 March 1988

The radiation-therapy machine, a Therac 25 linear accelerator, was designed to
send a penetrating X-ray or electron beam deep into a cancer patient's body to
destroy embedded tumors without injuring skin tissue.  But in three separate
instances in 1985 and 1986, the machine failed.  Instead of delivering a safe
level of radiation, the Therac 25 administered a dose that was more than 100
times larger then the typical treatment dose.  Two patients died and a third
was severely burned.
     The malfunction was caused by an error in the computer program controlling
the machine.  It was a subtle error that no one had picked up during the
extensive testing the machine had undergone.  The error surfaced only when a
technician happened to use a specific, unusual combination of keystrokes to
instruct the machine.
     The Therac incidents and other cases of medical device failures caused by
computer errors have focused attention on the increasingly important role
played by computers in medical applications.  Computers or machines with
built-in microprocessors perform functions that range from keeping track of
patients to diagnosing ailments and providing treatments.
     "The impact of computers on medical care and the medical community is the
most significant factor that we have to face," says Frank E.  Samuel Jr.,
president of the Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA), based in
Washington, D.C.  "Health care will change more dramatically in the next 10
years because of software-driven products than for any other single cause."
Samuel made his remarks as a recent HIMA-sponsored conference on the regulation
of medical software.
     At the same time, reports of medical devices with computer-related
problems are appearing more and more frequently.  In 1985, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) reported that recalls of medical devices because of
computer faults had roughly doubled over the previous five years.  Since then,
the number of such complaints has risen further.
     The problems range across a wide spectrum of computer-based medical
devices.  A system designed for monitoring several patients at once was
recalled because it kept mixing up the patients.  A programmable heart
pacemaker suddenly "froze" while it was being adjusted by a doctor.  A device
for dispensing insulin delivered the drug at an inappropriate rate.  An expert
system gave the wrong diagnosis, resulting in a patient receiving a drug
overdose.  An ultrasound scanner sometimes underestimated fetal weight.
     "No one can deny that allowing computers to perform some of the functions
normally carried out by trained and licensed medical professionals raises
questions concerning the personal health and safety of citizens," Michael
Gemignani of the University of Maine in Orono comments in ABACUS (Vol. 5, No.
1).  "But even if we agree something more needs to be done to protect society
in the face of these technological innovations, we are still left with the
question: What should be done and by whom?"
     The FDA, in its mandated role as guardian of public health and safety, is
now preparing to regulate the software component of medical devices.  The
agency's effort has already raised questions about what kinds of products,
software and information systems should be regulated.
     Last fall, the FDA published a draft policy for the regulation of computer
products marked for medical use.  In that policy, the concept of "competent
human intervention" sets the dividing line between what is and is not
regulated.  In other words, the computer product in question is subject to
regulation if a qualified doctor or nurse cannot effectively intervene to
override the machine's actions.  Devices such as software-driven cancer therapy
machines, programmable heart pacemakers and automatic drug dispensers clearly
fall into that category.
     On the other hand, the FDA states that it would not regulate computer
products that simply store, retrieve and disseminate information analogous to
that traditionally provided by textbooks and journals.  In addition, the
agency's regulations would not apply to computer products used only for
communications, general accounting or teaching.
     For example, a physician may use a computer program known as an expert
system to help make a diagnosis.  Because the expert system does not directly
drive another medical device that, say, could dispense a drug when needed, and
because the doctor can make an independent judgment, such an expert system
would be exempt from FDA rules governing medical devices.
     However, the greatest advantage of software - its flexibility - is also,
from a regulatory point of view, one of its biggest problems.  Computer
programs are easy to change and can be used in many different ways.  If
corrections are made or new features added, how much scrutiny should the
modified version of a previously approved computer product undergo?  That
question is still unresolved.
     Furthermore, it's sometimes hard to make a clear distinction between
programs that perform a "library" function and those that can be classified as
being part of a medical device.  A case in point is the patient medical record,
traditionally a file folder containing various sheets of paper listing
treatments, medical observations and other pieces of information vital for the
patient's proper care.
     Many hospitals are now moving toward medical records that are stored on a
computer.  The difficulty arises when such information systems are connected
directly to machines that, for example, record patient blood pressure and heart
rate.  If a nurse takes down the data and then enters the figures into a
computer, the information system software would not be subject to FDA rules.
But if the machine sends the data directly to the computer, then the
information system is considered by the FDA to be an "accessory" to a medical
device and subject the same level of regulation as the machine itself.
     Information system vendors disagree with the FDA's position.  They argue
that the FDA does not presently have rules governing the quality and content of
paper medical records.  There's no reason for the FDA to start regulating such
records, they say, just because the records happen to be in a computer's memory
rather than on paper.  In fact, using a computer-based system would
dramatically reduce the incidence of errors in patient records, the vendors
claim.  The benefits of improved record keeping would clearly outweigh the need
for burdensome regulation.
     The FDA's James S. Benson concedes that "regulation is not the automatic
solution to problems in hospitals and elsewhere."  Nevertheless, the agency
must comply with a 1976 law that contains a broad definition of what
constitutes a medical device.  Interpreted in its broadest sense, the
definition encompasses practically everything used in a hospital, from X-ray
machines to pencils.
     FDA officials say they recognize the difficulties involved in regulating
medical software.  "The agency fully appreciates the revolution occurring in
medicine with the introduction of computers and microprocessors," says Frank E.
Young, FDA commissioner.  "We're taking a reasoned, structured approach with a
minimum of oversight.  We have tried to give general guidelines.  The policy
has been deliberately made flexible."
     The flexibility allows the FDA to consider applications for approval on a
case-by-case basis.  That limits the "chilling fear of undue regulation," says
Young.  Furthermore, as technologies change and experience with computers in
medical applications grows, decisions on how much regulation is needed may also
change.
     To many manufacturers and users of medical products, the FDA's idea of
flexibility leaves too much uncertainty and opens up the possibility of
increased regulation in the future.  "The FDA casts too wide a net," says
Edward M. Basile of King &amp; Spalding, a law firm in Washington, D.C.  "Their
basic assumption is that everything should be regulated."
     "There's no disagreement about the extremes," says Harold M. Schoolman of
the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Md.  "The question is how and
where to draw the line between the extremes."  The important issue, he says, is
maintaining a balance between appropriate safeguards and incentives for
innovation.
     Even in situations where it's clear that certain software ought to be
reviewed, the FDA faces the additional difficulty of how to go about verifying
that a particular computer program does what it's supposed to do -- nothing
more, nothing less.  As experience with software for other applications has
shown, the task of checking software quality can be overwhelming (SN: 9/13/86,
p. 171).
     A few years ago, when most medical devices did not contain computers, it
was relatively easy to foresee all possible inputs and to check the
consequences of each one, says James Howard of General Electric's Medical
Systems Group in Milwaukee, Wis.  With computers, the number of possible paths
is greatly increased.  "It's more important than ever to build safe products
that perform as required," he says.  But because a detailed analysis takes so
long, it often can't be done.  "This is a major concern to both manufacturers
and the FDA," says Howard.
     The FDA defines software as a "set of instructions that enables a
computing machine to control, monitor or otherwise interact with a medical
device." The proposed regulations require a software developer to show that the
algorithm, or mathematical recipe, used in the computer program is appropriate
and has been implemented correctly in the software.  The FDA also requires
assurance that any software failure would not injure the patient.
     How that assurance can be provided is still unclear.  Techniques for
evaluating software safety are relatively new.  Who does the checking, how much
evidence is enough and whether the FDA can perform an independent check are
also unresolved issues.  Furthermore, software developers are wary of
submitting complete listings of the instructions in their computer programs
because competitors may get a look at this "source code" by making a request to
the FDA under the Freedom of Information Act.
     The trouble with the FDA approach, says Howard, is that it doesn't
consider under what conditions software is used.  Instead, the FDA ought to
focus on the idea that not all computer errors are equally serious.  Using a
kind of hazard analysis to focus on situations that could lead to
life-threating computer failures would be one way to eliminate the most serious
potential faults and to shorten testing times.
     Software developers also need to improve the methods they use for
constructing computer programs.  We need to "industrialize" software
development so that programs are written in a consistent way, says James
Dobbins of Verilog USA, Inc., in Alexandria, Va.  Too often, programmers
include a description of what each part of a program does only as an
afterthought.  They rarely go back to clean up or polish a program to make it
more understandable.
     Software development can be standardized and automated, says Dobbins.
"The tools are there to industrialize the whole process.  You just have to go
find them."
     Programmers, on the other hand, complain that they're in a no-win
situation.  Software is continually modified as it evolves, often to meet
demands for new features to make the product more competitive.  In the rush to
market, when delays can put a company at a competitive disadvantage, software
testing often loses out.  Delays in completing a software package are balanced
against the possibility of failing to root out potentially embarrassing errors.
     This is the kind of situation that can lead to lawsuits, says Vincent
Brannigan, an attorney in Adelphi, Md.  Software is clearly a product, he says.
If it's defective and injures a consumer, then the manufacturer is liable.
     Among the faults Brannigan lists is the tendency of software and computer
companies to promise more than they can fulfill and to cut costs by doing less
testing.  This is the only field, he says, where the customer is expected to
pay for finishing a product through the purchase of periodic updates and
corrections to the software.
     "Disclaimers don't mean anything," Brannigan says.  "The product should
have been right in the first place." That means paying much more attention to
how software is written and tested.  "The software must look as shiny and clean
as the rest of the machine," he says.
     So far, software developers have generally escaped damaging lawsuits and
settlements, but that may change.  To many medical-device producers, the threat
of litigation may be even more effective than proposed FDA regulations for
assuring the quality of products.
     Even finding out what went wrong is a time-consuming process.  The FDA and
other groups are still investigating aspects of why the Therac 25, manufactured
by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. in Kanata, Ontario, failed.  What's evident is
that the problem could probably have been avoided if an appropriate safety
analysis had been done.
     The Therac 25 delivers two forms of radiation:  either a high-energy
electron beam or, when a metal target intercepts the electron beam, a
lower-energy X-ray beam.  It turns out that when a nimble, experienced
technician punches in a particular sequence of commands faster than the
programmers had anticipated, the metal target fails to swing into place.
     A safety analysis would have identified the missing target as a
potentially dangerous situation.  The machine could have been programmed so
that it couldn't operate if the target, as confirmed by a sensor, were not in
place.
     Perhaps such a complex, computer-driven machine wasn't even necessary.  By
sacrificing a little convenience and flexibility, a machine with a simple
on-off switch and a timer could probably have done the same job - with a much
smaller chance of failure.

    [This is a familiar topic to RISKS readers, but this particular article
    is extremely well written and seems worth including, even if old.  
    (RISKS has reported one additional death involving the Therac.)  PGN]

	"This is the year of spying kits for kids," by Gary Marx

In a popular song Paul Simon tells us that `these are the days of miracle and
wonder.'  Surely this is so for the lucky child faced with a cornucopia of
computer and other electronic toys this holiday season.  But among the games
and educational tools is one category that should give us pause: spy toys.

In one catalogue, under the heading `Toys to Grow On,' for $19.95 you can
have Super Ears, which `help you detect even the slightest sounds!  Slip on
the headset and aim the disk; even if your target is far away, you'll hear
every rustle, every footstep, every breath, and every word!'  Another
stethoscope-like device permits you to hear `quiet breathing, through a
concrete wall a foot thick' and with `fidelity good enough to record.'  And
for only a few dollars, stockings can be stuffed with a Dyna-Mike Transmitter;
smaller than a quarter, it `will transmit every sound in a room to an FM radio
tuned to the proper frequency' up to two miles away.  Consider, too, the
possibilities of voice-activated miniature tape recorders that can be slipped
into a pocket, a drawer or under the bed.

In the wonderful world of advertising, eavesdropping is defined as a game and
spying on others is portrayed as fun and exciting.  Sellers argue that such
toys are also educational in introducing children to the mysteries of sound,
hearing and electricity, not to mention toe practical skills being developed.

In addition to listening to sounds in the woods and to playmates, older
brothers and sisters and even mommy and daddy can be secretly spied on.
Imagine the fun!  Think of the implications for the family power structure.
Children are now offered technical means of watching their parents, as well
as the reverse.  Children's rights take on new meaning.  As an added benefit,
adults may behave better at home, both because they want to set a good example
for curious children and because they fear being turned in by them.

And it is fun to spy on people.  Such `toys' directly feed childhood fantasies
of omnipotence.,  While not the same as being Superman and able to fly, it is
magical to be able to overhear conversations through a wall or from several
hundred yards away, or to secretly capture sound and play it back.

But it can also be wrong.  To encourage children to play at such activities
without at the same time instructing them in the immorality of invasive
information technology is irresponsible.

Defenders of toy guns argue that their products are just make-believe and are
harmless because they don't really work.  Children can indulge their violent
or protective fantasies without doing any immediate harm or confusing their
game with reality.  But this is not the case with many of the surveillance
devices.  They are attractive because they really do work.  Children are no
longer required even to pretend or to fantasize.

In becoming accustomed to such toys and the pleasures they bring, the seeds of
an amoral and suspicious adulthood are unwittingly being cultivated.

There are parallels to computer hackers.  How many of the growing number of
young computer criminals have simply carried over into their adult life a
juvenile game view of computer hacking, in which morality is irrelevant and
all that matters is the technical challenge?  Will private bugging,
wiretapping and video surveillance expand as a generation matures having had
these devices as childhood toys?

Children are also learning about the world of surveillance from the many
child-monitoring devices marketed for parents: transmitters clipped to a
child's clothing or put into a shoe that trigger an alarm on a parental
monitor if the child strays out of the signal-range area; wide-area
room-scanning by remote video; audio devices in children's bedrooms; at-home
urine tests for drugs.  What must the world look like to the child subjected
to these devices and simultaneously also given spy toys to play with.

At holiday time in a free-market economy, it is probably subversive or worse
to suggest that toys be banned on the basis of the bad moral message that they
send, rather than on the basis of the physical damage that they can do.  Yet
in the long run the latter may even be more costly because it is insidious and
its effects subtle and long-lasting.

One would hope that parents would favor toys that build trust and cooperation,
or that are at least neutral in the moral lessons that they bring, rather than
those that encourage spying and deception.  Children's and consumer advocacy
groups might add surveillance toys to their opposition to toys of violence.
At minimum there should be warning labels on such listening devices indicating
that their use in certain ways is illegal.  The toys should also come with
guidelines for appropriate use and instructional materials to help parents
discuss with children the moral issues around surreptitious listening and
recording.

In his novel `It Can't Happen Here,' Sinclair Lewis warned that if liberty
ever were undermined in the United States, it would be from within and would
occur gradually, even benignly.  He didn't have such toys in mind, but they
nicely illustrate his point."

author of *Undercover: Police Surveillance in America* (University of CA Press,
1988).  This op-ed article appeared on Christmas Day in The Los Angeles Times
and was reprinted with the author's permission in MIT's Tech Talk on 1/11/89.]

I don't get it. An issue of Risks arrives with not one but two accounts of
megabuck systems which essentially go into the trashcan.  Yet there are all
sorts of things, ranging from better procurement practices through structured
systems analysis which are supposed to have made these white elephants a thing
of the past.

I can think, offhand, of a number of hypotheses to explain the
continuing inability to deliver reliable, useful, on-budget software:

1) the technical people are all incompetent (I'm in the process of marking data
structures exams at the moment, so maybe I'm giving this one more credence than
I should!)

2) management people are all incompetent (perhaps in hiring incompetent
technical people, perhaps in interfering with technical aspects of the
procurement process)

3) large bureaucratic structures of the sort found in government and industry
inherently interfere with the development of usable systems

4) the `structured programming revolution', and structured systems analysis,
really don't count for much

5) structured systems analysis is a good idea, but practitioners don't know how
to apply it effectively

Undoubtedly, the true answer is a mixture of these, along with others that I
just can't think of at 4:45 am. The issue is not finding a specific cause (if
#3 is to blame, there's not too much we can do about that!); rather, we as
professionals should try to identify the factors which bring about system
demise, and loudly describe them to all and sundry.

It seems clear that all the methodologies in the world won't rescue a system
which is designed by an administrator in conjunction with a marketing person
from a vendor; nor would one expect anything worthwhile from a system effort in
which no user/management input was ever solicited. We have to do more of a job
of explaining the limits and the imperatives of the technology to non-technical
people than we've been doing so far.

   [By the way, today's San Francisco Chronicle has an article on the new
   computer system for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) that is finally being
   readied for operation, many years late and many millions of dollars over
   budget.  PGN]

     RISKS is a forum dedicated to computer related risks, so it is natural
that the articles presented should focus primarily on risks and computers.
This reader, however, often feels that the conclusions reached here miss
important points because the authors have consciously or unconsciously wrapped
themselves in RISKS blinders.
     Since they arrived this morning, I will use the two articles in RISKS 8.5
as examples: "Digital Photos and the Authenticity of Information" (Dave
Robbins) and "Medical software" (Ivars Peterson via Robert Morris).
     The first article begins with a discussion of computer editing of
photographs, and the ease with which such previously incontrovertible evidence
can now be forged.  The author then goes on to make three main points, which I
will restate briefly:
     1)  Electronically stored records can be altered or forged without
         leaving any visible traces.
     2)  Computer technology makes it easier to forge or alter records
         because more people posses the neccesary skills.
     3)  Computer technology makes it possible to store such large amounts
         of data that we are unable to check the validity of any
         single record.
     I certainly agree with Mr. Robbins that there are important issues raised
by computer based record keeping, but I don't believe these three are among
them.  The first and third points are related, so I will discuss them together.
While the sheer mass of information makes it more difficult to authenticate
records by "conventional" means, these records are not unauditable.  This same
mass of records enables far more sophisticated consistancy checking than was
ever before possible.  Welfare fraud is possible in a non-computer based
environment, but sorting the ranks of welfare recipients against the owners of
40 foot yachts and mercedes-benz automobiles is not.  With regards to the ease
of forging provided by computers, I do not agree with mr. Robbins in any way.
Yes, there are some individuals who are now able to forge records far more
effectively than they ever could in the past, but this is ignoring the tens or
even hundreds of thousands of people who could forge records in the past but
are unable to now.  In high school, I could forge the birthdate on my drivers
license with a pencil and a piece of chalk.  I'd like to see the typical high
school kid do the same level of forgery to a microprocessor controlled smart
card.  It is true that forgery of photographs is coming into the hands of the
common "criminal," but the very ease of forgery will be what is responsible for
removing such records from the ranks of acceptible evidence.  Video tapes will
probably continue to be acceptible until such time as they can be economically
altered.
     In RISKS, we tend to have our blinders on to the dangers alone.  There are
unquestionably very real risks in our information based society, but if you
look at the risks in a vacuum devoid of gains and benefits, you will deprive
yourself of enourmous advantages.  I may have arguements with the enormous
corporations which maintain my credit records, but at the same time I am very
thankful to them for providing the service which enables me to walk into any
store anywhere in the world and pay for goods in any currency with a small
piece of plastic which is linked to my bank account.
     The second article, on "Medical Software" is an example of a different
kind of blinder which we wear.  The problem of testing and validating advanced
hardware is not in any way unique to computers.  Within my lifetime we have had
advances across the board which raise these questions.  Electric motors have
become so powerful, lightweight, and common place that manufacturers of lawn
tools have to explicitly state that the lawn mower should not be carried at
waist height to trim shrubs.  Hair driers and portable radios have become so
ubiquitous that manufacturers have to worry about consumers placing them in or
near the sink or shower.  The only thing which makes the computer industry
unique is that it is young enough to have been granted special priviledges to
sell incomplete or unfinished products.  General Motors issues a recall.
Microsoft SELLS you version 4.0.
     Product liability is extremely important in the computer field, as it is
in any other field, but we should not place our selves on so high a pedastle
that we can not see the connections between what we are doing and what other
fields are doing, because that is precisely what got us into this problem in
the first place.

Following as it did the intelligent &amp; informed _Guardian_ leader article 
on the risks on technology (RISKS 8-4), there was an item today's paper, 
in the COMPUTER GUARDIAN section which makes me really shudder. 

In an article comparing the changing roles of FAX, telex and electronic 
mail, Warren Newman writes:

   "There are disadvantages to FAX and telex. The main one being lack 
   of confidentiality. An electronic mailbox is secure. You have the 
   key in the form of a password and only you can look at the contents.

   Most fax machines and telex machines are kept in common service areas
   where a secretary or clerk will collect the message and deliver it"

			-- from "Fax becomes a favourite",
			   Computer Guardian, Thursday January 12 1989

What nonsense! This sort of thing perpetuates the conspiracy of silence 
concerning risks of electronic mail systems.

Going back to the subject of the 737 crash at East Midlands Airport,
I noticed another item of possible interest to RISKS readers in today's
paper.

	"Mr Freddie Yetman, technical secretary of the British Airline
	Pilots' Association [the pilots's union --NR] said that the 
	investigators 'must have some suspicion of these circuits'.

	'It points to a possible spurious warning being given to the
	flight deck. But how the devil do you get a spurious warning
	from an infallible system?' "

   The underlying implication of the excerpted article is that high technology
should bring perfect safety.  This is not a premise that most of us would
consider valid.  It is also not necessarily the goal of all high-tech systems.

   Improved technology is supposed to bring some kind of improvement.  It might
be improved safety, performace, economy or something else.  Our modern
airliners have clearly shown themselves to be superior in many ways to our old
models.  The latest airline technology has not yet had a chance to prove itself
in service, but the new features are intended to yield all-around "better"
aircraft.

   Fighter aircraft on the other hand, are not designed to be the safest
vehicles we can make, but rather are intended to be able to survive hostile
threats while successfully attacking a target.  Their hi-tech is primarily
directed at military goals.  Indeed they do crash, and they are dangerous.  It
is not higher technology that is the problem though, but rather the nature of
fighter aircraft tactics and training.  Training in populated areas will
involve costs in lives on the ground.  That is not an issue of technology but
rather one of policy.

   High technology, including computer technology, is not going to solve
all of our problems at once.  The author of the article observes this in 
the last line of the quoted paragraph.  On the other hand, high-technology
is not necessarily creating worse problems.  In this case, new airliners 
are not necessarily less safe.  What we as technologists must do is make 
the public aware of the limitations of our work, so that backlash against 
the failures that will occur will not prevent us as a society from making 
progress, improvements, and bettering the lot of mankind.

Fellow Riskees:

I'm writing a book, and I need a title.
  
It's about computer risks:  counter-espionage, networks, computer security, 
and a hacker/cracker that broke into military computers.  It's a true 
story about how we caught a spy secretly prowling through the Milnet.
  
Although it explains technical stuff, the book is aimed at the lay reader.
In addition to describing how this person stole military information,
it tells of the challenges of nailing this guy, and gives a slice of 
life from Berkeley, California.
  
You can read a technical description of this incident in the 
Communications of the ACM, May, 1988;  or Risks Vol 6, Num 68.

Better yet, read what my editor calls "A riveting, true-life adventure of
electronic espionage" ... available in September from Doubleday, publishers of
the finest in computer counter-espionage nonfiction books.
  
  
So what?
  
Well, I'm stuck on a title.  Here's your chance to name a book.  
  
Suggest a title (or sub-title).  If my editor chooses your title, 
I'll give you a free copy of the book, credit you in the acknowledgements, 
and send you a box of homemade chocolate chip cookies.
  
Send your suggestions to    CPStoll@lbl.gov   or   CPStoll@lbl (bitnet) 
             Many thanx!    Cliff Stoll

  [Weihnachts STOLLen (German Christmas cookies) might be appropriate for
  the cookies.  With a different publisher, Cliff could have called the book
  "Stalking the Wiley Hacker".  But since Abner Doubleday is widely credited
  with having invented baseball, you could call it "Who's on Wurst?".  PGN]

&gt; (Regarding a posting on the Therac-25 radiation therapy accidents, Don
&gt; Alvarez writes)  ... The problem of testing and validating advanced 
&gt; hardware is not any way unique to computers.  (Then he gives examples
&gt; of accidents that might arise from people abusing non-computerized 
&gt; equipment: trimming hedges with electric lawn mowers and putting portable
&gt; radios in the shower).

I work in radiation therapy and just finished a lot of research on the Therac
accidents, and there are two points I would like to make:

First, the Therac accidents were *not* examples of people abusing equipment
contrary to instructions, as in the examples Don gives.  The accidents happened
because the machine included faults in software and, many would argue, 
additional design errors in the hardware which provided insufficient protection
against software faults.  It is arguable that the clinics do bear some 
responsibility also, because they continued to use the machines after they
had some evidence that there were problems with the machine --- but faults
in the machine were the source of the problem.

Second, are computer-controlled devices a *special problem*?  Overall, I
agree with Don that the problems of testing and validating machinery are
broadly similar whether the machinery includes a computer or not.  However,
we currently have a special problem with computer-controlled devices because
industry practices in software development are often much worse than for
other kinds of technology.   The Therac is a glaring example of this;
the physical design of the radiation-producing apparatus was considered
superb; the control system, and in particular the software (it is now clear)
were very poor, relative to the safety requirements of this application.
Therefore, I do not think that articles in the press (or RISKS postings)
devoted to this problem are in any way analogous to "blinders"; rather,
they are well-deserved attention to a problem that ought to be fixed.

In particular, it is very important to understand that people are not picking
on the Therac-25 just because the faults involved a computer.  This machine
was more dangerous than machines with similar functionality that were
not computer controlled, even the ones built by the same manufacturer.
The particular hazard manifested in the Therac accidents has been 
well-understood since a similar series of accidents with one of the first
(non-computerized) accelerators in 1966.  Evers since, this hazard has
been adequately handled in most machines by non-programmable hardwired
interlocks.

It is reasonable to expect that successive product generations that introduce
new technologies should represent progress overall.  When a new product
turns out to be *less* safe than its predecessors, that is newsworthy.

I was paging through a recently acquired 727 manual and came across this little
gem of wisdom.  (GPWS is the ground proximity warning system.  It tells the
crew when the ground is getting too close for what they're doing.)

     "Note: the GPWS will not provide a warning if an airplane is flying
     directly towards a vertical cliff."

Gee, thanks.  I'll keep that in mind. :-}

In reply to Steve Philipson's remarks about aircraft, a friend once pointed out
to me that fighter aircraft are designed to a lower safety standard than
civilian aircraft, "because if 1 in 1000 crashes due to mechanical problems,
that's far less than are lost due to combat" -- as a matter of policy, some
safety is sacrificed for improved performance.

Mr. Philipson also wisely points out that people involved in technology should
point out to the public the risks associated with that technology, so that
intelligent policy debate can be carried out.  Unfortunately, new technology is
often sold as "risk-free", when it isn't.  Even more unfortunately, new
technology often won't be allowed by the public unless a (false) appearance of
no risk is maintained -- people reject new technologies on the basis of risks,
even if larger risks are already accepted in old technologies.  (A bizarre case
is AIDS in the United States -- the number of people who have ever died of AIDS
in the U.S. is less than the number who die yearly of motor vehicle accidents,
but we don't convene national commissions on motor vehicle accidents!)

By now we've seen several cases in which computer-based systems failed because
they did not implement features which had been implicit in the physical systems
they replaced.  Thus, for example, physical mechanisms do a great deal of
implicit sanity-checking, inasmuch as ten and ten thousand look much more
different when coded as angular velocities than when coded in binary.
Computational abstraction is attractive because it is less cumbersome than
physical realization, but cumbersomeness is very often a virtue in itself since
it assures that important parts of the world will tend to move at manageable
speeds.  Drawing up balance sheets of risks and benefits of various uses of
computer technology is a good and necessary thing.  The problem is that we've
always benefitted from the implicit virtues of physical objects without ever
having to articulate them.  The time to make a good, thorough list of these
virtues is now, before we've lost them for good.

    A few random thoughts:

    Yes, the time is here when we can no longer believe photographs
we see published.  This even goes for the bastion of reliability:
The National Geographic.  At least two of their covers have been
digitaly retouched.  One was of two pyramids and a camel in the sunset.
One of the pyramids was moved over to fit the space requirements of
the cover.  Another cover was a photo of an old man somewhere in
the mid-east, I believe.  They liked his face, but also liked the
headdress another man was wearing, so they put the other headdress
on his head.  It looked real.  Painters have done this for years.
The Mona Lisa was a composite.  What is new is the technology for
doing it in a supposedly "trusted" medium.

    But this information is catching on.  A friend was in an auto
accident.  No one was hurt, but damage was done to the car.  One of
the parties took a Polaroid photo of the scene.  The attendant police
officer asked to see it.  He signed and dated it on the back.  Otherwise
he said it would be inadmissable as evidence.  His signature was there
to state that yes, that's the way things looked.

    As to evidence of computer crime, I believe U.S. Federal rules
regard whatever the computer prints out as "best evidence".  Scary.

    The intelligent gun brought to mind a friend who's an Electrical
Engineer.  An appliance manufacturer came to him to design an intelligent
toaster.  It has a knob on the front and an LED readout of the "brownness"
setting.  Unfortunately, all it is is a timer circuit that times how brown
the toast should be.  The old way of doing things (a bimetal strip)
had feedback from the active site.  Not so the new.  The intelligent
toaster with an open heating element will proudly pop up raw bread
after 90 seconds.  Worse yet, flaming toast could keep being heated 
until it's supposedly brown enough.

    On the computerization of hospitals, a friend of mine (who shall
obviously remain nameless) was working on software for a hospital.  One
project was the scheduling of IVs.  A typical regimen would be to administer
a unit of saline mixed with some drug every six hours.  i.e. noon, six p.m.,
midnight, six a.m., etc.  Daylight saving time then happened.  Being a good
UNIX system, it carried right on: noon, six p.m., midnight (time change)
seven a.m., 1 p.m., etc.  The hospital was up in arms.  They claimed the IVs
were an hour late.  My friend had to give in.  So now between the midnight
and six a.m.  doses, there may be five or seven hours depending on the time
change.  The administration wasn't particularly worried about over or under
medicating the patients.  Doses around 2 a.m. tend to get skipped.  Moral:
don't leave your money in the bank around the year 2000, and don't check
into a hospital around daylight savings time changeover.

&gt;Are we approaching the point (or have we reached it already?) where
&gt;truth is, for all practical purposes, whatever the computer says it is?
&gt;Where what is accepted as truth is easily manipulated by those who are
&gt;privileged to have access to the digital keepers of truth?

Recently, in an archeological excavation in the middle east, a large stone
tablet was unearthed.  Scholars determined that it was an ancient audit
report, complaining about the use of papyrus scrolls by the scribes.  It was
clear that such scrolls lacked the evidential integrity of stone and clay
tablets.

As recently as when I got into data processing, auditors were complaining
that punched cards lacked the integrity of ledger cards.  I had to work very
hard to convince the auditors that the new batch controls were equal to the
transaction-by-transaction controls to which they were accustomed.  There is
a cruel irony to the fact that I am still here to hear them complain about
the passing of batch controls and the return to transaction controls.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.  What goes around, comes
around.  Those who fail to heed the lessons of history, are doomed to repeat
them.

The same computers that enable us to manipulate records, also enable us to make
so many copies that no one person can alter them all.  The same computers that
enable us to digitize an analog record (e.g. a photograph), manipulate it, and
return it to analog, also enable us to create digital signatures to make any
such tampering obvious and the absence of such tampering equally obvious.

In the nineteenth century wills and contracts were expected to be hand written.
When the typewriter came along, they continued to be hand written for some time
for reasons of admissability as evidence.  Today, a hand written will is
suspicious.  Even though digitally signed wills and contracts are orders of
magnitude more difficult to forge than typewritten ones, type written documents
will like survive, even be preferred, for two more decades.

There was a time when the testimony from memory of the elders was preferred to
written records.

In this context, it is interesting to note that a vanishingly small number of
transactions are disowned.  Almost none are litigated.  A single forgery hardly
ever carries the day.  Hardly ever is the record of the contract at issue; it
is almost always the intent.

Written on the list of heresies and other words I try to live by, it says
"there is no truth, there are only hypothesies and evidence."  In the short
run, while we rethink our ideas of evidence yet again, the forgers may have a
field day.  I am not much worried for the long run.

In RISKS volume 8 issue 5, Dave Robbins writes:

&gt; We have no practical means of verifying the integrity of 
&gt; such large volumes of information, and are thus left with no choice but 
&gt; to trust that the electronic records are accurate. 

On the contrary.  Our other choice is to REFUSE to trust the accuracy of
the records.  If there is a computer record of at $100,000 withdrawal
from my savings account, the bank does not have to trust the record. 
The computer record is circumstantial evidence: it might provide useful
insight for further investigation, but it is not to be trusted as
conclusive proof. 

&gt; It is wholly 
&gt; impractical, for example, for the Social Security Administration's 
&gt; entire data base (how many hundreds of millions of individual records?) 
&gt; to be manually audited to verify its accuracy.

It would be no less impractical if all that information were on 3x5"
cards.  When dealing with volumes of information like this, you accept a
certain RISK of fraud and error as the norm, and investigate (manually
audit) the most egregious cases.  You can't blame computers for causing this
situation, and I think you'll have to give them credit for helping
ameliorate it.

The Hacker's Conference episode is just one of many.  Readers of USENET
last month closely followed attempts by the press to shut down my own
moderated newsgroup.  As in the CBS case, where you were "guaranteed" that
the story would put you in a good light, the reporter who interviewed me
acted in a very sympathetic manner.

Ha.

With most reporters I have encountered in this area, the fact is this:
If the reporter decides in advance that you're a wrongdoer, then just
about anything is ethical to get the story.  In particular, they will
pretend to agree with you and indicate that they are writing a favourable
story.   After all, it's not unethical to lie to criminals to get them to
expose themselves, is it?

This is general advice, but we must be particularly careful when it comes
to public exposure of modern technology.   People are predisposed to
fear it.  People are now predisposed to link hacker with criminal.  People
are predisposed to link "computer network" with "underground."
Watch out for this.  If you suspect the slightest bit of prejudice, clam
up.  Don't trust a word they say -- their motives are not yours.

The image of technology is very important to RISKS.  It controls what
technologies people will trust, and how they will trust them.

An anonymous contributor in <A HREF="/Risks/7.82.html">RISKS-7.82</A> notes the dangers of computer course
registration procedures using touchtone phones.  Our university also has the
same system and also uses the easily accessible SSN and birthdate as id's and
passwords.  Those risks are bad enough but I'm more fascinated by the risks
produced by the unexpected interaction among new computer technologies.  Our
university is much more concerned presently with getting computer registration
to work right than about security of the system.  Last semester, the system's
first run, many more students than anticipated had incomplete schedules because
the computer, not knowing any better, actually enforced prerequisites that had
long been ignored, blocked out the entire three hours scheduled for a lab that
everyone knew really only lasted one hours, etc.  This meant an astounding
number ("astounding" means about 30 times more than the system was designed to
handle) of students had to complete their schedules in a two-day period using
touchphones and a few scattered terminals to drop and add courses.  Of course,
most students trying to call the computer got busy signals.  Now here's the
interaction: not long ago the university also installed a fancy local switch
that gave all campus phones, including one in every dorm room, all sorts of
fancy features.  Not only was automatic redialing available, but also a cute
feature that calls you back when the busy line you are calling becomes free.
No telling how much of the switch's resources are required for that little
goodie.  The obvious outcome was that both the computer registration system AND
the campus phone network were brought to their knees.  Smart students then
figured out they were better off calling from off campus even without the
auto-redial features, but then the whole community phone system became
sluggish.

In a previous article, Vince Manis wonders about software project
failures and tries to figure out why they happen. 

     I can think, offhand, of a number of hypotheses to explain the
     continuing inability to deliver reliable, useful, on-budget software:
               [He gives 5 reasons...]
     Undoubtedly, the true answer is a mixture of these, along with others
     that I just can't think of at 4:45 am.

Well, it's 4:45 am here too, but I can propose at least one more hypothesis.
How about:

     6) The structured programming revolution is a real bad idea that has
        been significantly holding back progress for years.

Now, as I wait for the structured programming police to go after me, I'll
try to defend this statement.

First, isn't it just a little bit silly to think that making rules about
how programs are indented, whether or not to use goto statements, ...etc. will
really make a difference to a large software project.  A piece of software
can be perfectly indented, totally goto free, and absolutely positively wrong.
Likewise, it can be full of goto statements, line up as straight as a board
against the left column of the page, and still be provably correct.  In fact,
for any purported structured programming rule that I've ever heard of, I
propose that one could create a perfectly correct piece of software which
violates that rule.

So maybe the structured programming movement isn't really about correctness.
Maybe it's strong suit is helping us make maintainable software.  This may
or may not be true, but I've sure seen lots of purportedly structured programs
that were very difficult for me to maintain.  Likewise, I can conceive of
programs which would offend a structured programming supporter, but which
could quickly and easily be comprehended by a maintenance programmer.
Anyways, when you are selling into a competitive market of millions of end
users, maintaining software is impractical.  It has to be correct on
the first shipment and it can't really be changed once it's out there.  So
having a maintainable structured program really isn't all that useful.  Being
maintainable is just an excuse to be buggy.

Have there been any double blind studies which unambiguously show that
the kind of programs that structured programming partisans enjoy are
really more maintainable than some other kind of program?  I've heard
lots of testimonials, but no real evidence.

Maybe the structured programming movement is about allowing a group of
programmers to work together on a large project.  OK, but what REALLY happens
when a group of structured programmers tries to develop a large program?
Usually they argue about how the program should be indented, what the comments
should be like, how the subroutines should be nested, ... etc.  Often they
argue about those issues much more than they argue about things like how can
the algorithms be checked for correctness, how will the end users perceive the
programs, what should the program's performance be like ... etc.  You know, the
stuff that the customer cares about.

So maybe structured programming is about making programs run faster and
use less of the computer's resources?

Yes, structured programming techniques don't really improve correctness,
maintainability, usability or performance.  But the real problem with the
structured programming movement is that so many programmer believe
in it.  They believe that by following these techniques, they will produce
good programs.  It just isn't so.  Programming is much harder than that.

The RISK is that these programmers initiate projects based on the belief
that structured programming is the atomic bomb of the software war.  When
the structured programming techniques fail to make the problem easier,
and the programmers are confronted with the grim reality of how incredibly
much work it takes to make the project succeed, the project usually fails.

Occasionally, there are enough resources on the project that if the programmers
put in enough all night work sessions, they can just barely get the project out
before somebody pulls the plug on the whole thing.  Usually, during this
exercise, structured programming takes a back seat to getting the project
finished.  This is how successful software projects happen.  Programmers and
their all night programming sessions have become a national joke.

I don't know if we'll soon figure out how to make successful large systems.  As
far as I know, nobody's really got that completely figured out yet, or they'd
be turning out a flood of really great programs.  I haven't seen that flood
yet.  In the mean time, instead of structured programming, I have some other
ideas:

1) Concentrate much more on what the end user gets than on how structured
   the program is.  Don't let the user's view of the program happen by
   accident.  If the program is interactive, then everything counts here.
   For example, you even have to take into account the real-time behavior of
   the program.  Page faults or swapin/swapout are no excuse to an end user who
   is trying to get his work done and the system's performance isn't good.
   Everything that the user sees the program do is the program developer's
   responsibility.

2) Look closely at other people's attacks on the problem.  Very rarely are
   you the first or second to tackle any given problem.  Learn from others
   successes and mistakes.  Spend a lot of time reading other peoples code.

3) Rely on logical reasoning to decide whether or not something will work.
   Even if it's perfectly structured, it probably fails under some
   condition.  Use your mind and your logical reasoning skills to make
   sure that it doesn't.

4) Don't use algorithms that you don't understand.  First figure them
   out, then consider using them.  This is especially true of numerical
   methods.  It's not really a very good excuse to the end user to say
   that the reason that the software failed is because some supposedly
   black box procedure failed.  Understand black boxes.  Open them up
   when you can.

5) Don't kid yourself into thinking that you are sure about how a
   piece of software will behave when you really aren't sure.  If you
   aren't sure, the software is probably is wrong.  Go to step 3) above.

6) Take personal responsibility for every single character that you put
   into the source.  If something is wrong, and you put it there, then
   it's your fault.   ... even if it's perfectly well structured.

I'll end this note with a plea.  Let's let the structured programming movement
die.  The computer science field is too young to let that kind of stifling
pseudo-science suppress inovation.  We need to continue to experiment with
entirely new ways to structure programs.  The ones we have now are not good
enough.  Let a thousand new kinds of structuring bloom!

Request for Comments: PPPP				 January 1989
 
				Ethics and the Internet
 
Status of this Memo
 
This memo is a statement of policy by the Internet Activities
Board concerning the proper use of the resources of the Internet.
 
Introduction

At great human and economic cost, resources drawn from the U.S. and government,
industry and the academic community have been assembled into a collection of
interconnected networks called the Internet.  Begun as a vehicle for
experimental network research in the mid-1970's, the Internet has become an
important national infrastructure supporting an increasingly widespread,
multi-disciplinary community of researchers ranging, inter alia, from computer
scientists and electrical engineers to mathematicians, physicists, medical
researchers, chemists, astronomers and space scientists.

As is true of other common infrastructure (e.g. roads, water reservoirs and
delivery systems, and the power generation and distribution network), there is
widespread dependence on the Internet by its users for the support of
day-to-day research activities.

The reliable operation of the Internet and the responsible use of its resources
is of common interest and concern for its users, operators and sponsors. Recent
events involving the hosts on the Internet and in similar network
infrastructures underscore the need to reiterate the professional
responsibility every Internet user bears to colleagues and to the sponsors of
the system. To the extent that the Internet resources are provided by the U.S.
Government, this responsibility becomes a Federal matter above and beyond
simple professional ethics.
 
IAB Statement of Policy

The Internet is a national facility whose utility is largely a consequence of
its wide availability and accessibility.  Irresponsible use of this critical
resource poses an enormous threat to its continued availability to the
technical community.

The U.S. Government sponsors of this system have a fiduciary responsibility to
the Legislature to allocate government resources wisely and effectively.
Justification for the support of this system suffers when highly disruptive
abuses occur.  Access to and use of the Internet is a privilege and should be
treated as such by all users of this system.

The IAB strongly endorses the view of the Division Advisory Panel of the
National Science Foundation Division of Network, Communications Research and
Infrastructure which, in paraphrase, characterized as unethical and
unacceptable any activity which purposely:
 
	(a) seeks to gain unauthorized access to the resources of the Internet
        (b) disrupts the intended use of the Internet
	(c) wastes resources (people, capacity, computer) through such actions 
	(d) destroys the integrity of computer-based information
or	(e) compromises the privacy of users

The Internet exists in the general research milieu. Portions of it continue to
be used to support research and experimentation on networking. Because
experimentation on the Internet has the potential to affect all of its
components and users, researchers have the responsibility to exercise great
caution in the conduct of their work. Negligence in the conduct of
Internet-wide experiments is both irresponsible and unacceptable.

The IAB plans to take whatever actions it can, in concert with Federal agencies
and other interested parties, to identify and to set up technical and
procedural mechanisms to make the Internet more resistant to disruption. Such
security, however, is extremely expensive and may be counterproductive if it
inhibits the free flow of information which makes the Internet so valuable. In
the final analysis, the health and well-being of the Internet is the
responsibility of its users who must, uniformly, guard against abuses which
disrupt the system and threaten its long-term viability.

At the Congress, 48 electronic documents including position papers, 
agenda, press material etc. were available free of charge. Most of
the documents are in German (better: Anglo-German techno slang), but
several documents are translated in English, French, Swedish and 
Netherlandish, so people without German language knowledge may get
an impression of CCC'88 in their respective language (if available).

This document describes the content of the diskette which I received;
the electronic documents are essentially in ASCII, except in some
German documents where vowel-mutations appear.

Name, content and size of each documents are described below.
Content is either described by the headline or (if not available) by 
information selected from the texts (in parentheses), both in the 
respective language; in the German package, the content is also
described in English. The documents are collected in packages, and 
they are essentially unchanged (I only deleted many blank lines; 
special non-ASCII characters have not been changed).

You may get the package(s) either by e-mail or via traditional post
from my address (below).

I read Bruce Karsh's diatribe with incredulity.  He conjures up from thin
air a straw man to denounce.  I simply cannot find any contact between the
"structured programming" that he talks about and structured programming as
it is understood in the computer science and software engineering communities.

It is clear that Karsh has never taken the time to learn anything about real
structured programming.  As a beginning, I suggest that he should read,
STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING, O.-J. Dahl, E.W. Dijkstra and C.A.R. Hoare, Academic
Press, 1972.  If he feels that a book is too much to read, he might try
"On Structured Programming--a reply to Smoliar," David Gries, COMMUNICATIONS
OF THE ACM, November 1974 (and subsequent correspondence).  At least then
he could criticize something that some of us think is worth defending.

It is a misrepresentation of structured programming to present it as concerned
just with trivia like indentation and goto-less coding.  Those are a part of
the tradition, as it were, because they aid in assurance of correctness.  That
is, a properly indented, and goto-free program, is more likely to be known to
be correct.  There is the additional claim that it's harder to write correct
programs with goto statements; it's been 20 years and more, and I don't propose
to reopen that can of worms right now.

I heard Harlan Mills speak recently; apart from some fairly scathing attacks on
those who advocate (and market) what I'll all ``cookbook structured
programming'' (such as the rules cited as the totality of the answer), he made
some astounding claims.  For example, he cited several projects done at IBM, by
people trained in his methodologies, that worked.  Period.  No defects.  No
bugs.  No fixes.  And he was talking about non-trivial programs -- systems of
100K lines, written by teams of programmers.

In Risks 8.8, Bruce Karsh (karsh@sgi.com) asserts that "...the structured
programming revolution is a real bad idea that has been significantly holding
back progress for years."  Now, I don't consider myself one of the "structured
programming police" he refers to with apparent contempt; however, I feel the
need to reply to his reasonably eloquent -- and largely off-the-mark -- 
article.

Without rehashing a debate which has raged for years, I submit that Mr. Karsh's
view of structured programming is rather limited.  Structured programming,
along with structured design, structured analysis, data structured design and a
plethora of other so-called structured techniques, are, quite simply, tools and
methods to aid the software designer.  All of the generally accepted methods
commonly touted in industry publications are more than just rules on how to
indent code or how to name one's variables.  (Those concerns are perhaps more
properly relegated to coding standards than to methodologies.)  The structured
methodologies strive to quantify the often "magic" process of creating good
software.  They provide a discipline to use when solving problems.

Discipline is necessary when attacking a problem -- particularly a large one.
Applying a disciplined approach to a problem is much more than blindly applying
rules that have been cast in stone.  Unfortunately, as Mr. Karsh points out,
there are a lot of programmers who wrongly believe that "by following [the
structured] techniques, they will produce good programs." Blindly applying
*any* set of guidelines is no guarantee of a good result.  That is true of
programming, as well as writing, drawing, designing hardware -- in fact, of
almost any creative endeavor.  However, that does not imply that the guidelines
are, themselves, a "real bad idea."  Instead, it implies that the person using
those guidelines is treating them as a recipe.  Structured techniques are more
than just a list of Dos and Don'ts; they represent a philosophy of software
design centered around the systematic, disciplined decomposition of a problem.

Sadly, Mr. Karsh seems to have missed this point.  He bolsters his arguments
against using structured programming by lamenting that structured programmers
spend too much time arguing about how to indent code and how to structure
comments.  He's right: If that's all they do, they've missed the larger issues
and are wasting everyone's time.  If that sort of structured programmer is the
only sort he has met, he has my sympathies.  However, instead of condemning the
structured techniques, he should place the blame where it belongs, with those
programmers who espouse these techniques without properly understanding them.
I believe he would have done so had he, himself, been more knowledgeable on the
subject.

In closing, I recommend to Mr. Karsh any number of books and articles on
structured techniques.  Look for the names Michael Jackson, Edward Yourdon
Larry Constantine, and Edsger Dijkstra in your favorite computer store and
in back issues of "Communications of the ACM."  A particularly good
overview is Yourdon's _Managing the Structured Techniques_, 2nd edition.
The structured techniques are not perfect, and, as Mr. Karsh's article
suggests, they are even less perfectly understood by far too many
practicing programmers.  They do, however, provide a very practical
foundation for the creative and disciplined problem solver.

In RISKS-8.6, in the article entitled "Losing Systems," Vince Manis tries to
puzzle out various reasons why large software projects in non-technical
situations have a significant failure rate. Several risks articles have been
devoted to these failures.

I must say that I feel that the number one cause of this is our educational
system and our attitudes towards education. Many students today, from grade 
school to postgraduate institutions are only interested in learning that 
which they perceive to be useful in a future job. Thus, we get the "why do 
I have to learn that?" syndrome. This leads to managers and beaureaucrats
that are for the most part computer illiterate. As they see it, computers
are an appliance, like the office copier, that should perform on demand.
After all, the company computer system does not help get the company's
products to market; it prints the employee checks :-)

Managers see knowledge about computing only useful to engineers and 
programmers. Business schools for the most part do not teach computer 
literacy, nor how a non-technical manager should deal with a large software 
system in his company. Buying a computer/software system may be one of
the most expensive decisions a manager has to make.

On the other hand, engineers, and programmers rarely take any business
courses. Most computing/MIS programs don't even list them as options!
They see that as something only useful to managers and beaureaucrats.

The problem this leads to is lack of understanding between technical
and non-technical persons. The technical person often does not know how
to ask the non-technical person what he wants and the non-technical person
does not know how to tell it to the technical person. Non-technical 
managers often do not understand such things as throughput, disk space,
etc., and are intimidated by the technical terms. They do understand  that
the system will respond in a certain amount of time to a request and that
it can only deal with so many employee records.

Specifying the cost of these systems becomes largely a guess worked on
by two groups with no common understanding. Additionally, because many of 
these large business/government systems are custom systems, there is often 
no previous experience to go by. The technical people do not understand how 
the system they are designing will really affect the business in which it 
will be used; the managers do not understand the system they are buying 
(other than through the list of features and functionality in the 
specification - which can often be a formidably encyclopeadic document). We 
end up with estimates of the cost of the system that are poor at best.

Business managers and beaureaucrats need to see beyond the end of their bottom
lines and become more computer literate. Business schools should teach and
require more computer courses. Engineers and programmers need to see beyond the
end of their keyboards, and understand the impact of their work on the customer
and the customer's industry. They need some business education (maybe even some
education on computers and society, and computers and their risks :-) ).
Managers cannot continue to treat computers as appliances. They affect too much
of the business. Engineers shouldn't act as if they know what's best for the
customer (even if he is not sure what he wants). The cutting edge is not always
the best fit to a situation.

In RISKS-8.7, next-to-last entry, Gary McClelland mentions a computerized
course-registration system that "actually enforced prerequisites that had long
been ignored" (among its other sins).

In connection with this: a few years ago, IBM/Haifa Scientific Center tried to
set up an expert-system advisor for students at Bar-Ilan university (Bnei
Brak, Israel). They did the standard Prolog drill "prove that student X can
graduate". A very short time later, Prolog came back with the message "Theorem
is false": there were so many obsolete regulations on the books that, if you
worked by the book, no one would ever have graduated!.

Since  this  all  happened  in  an experimental ressearch project, no student
actually got burnt; so I don't knwo if this qualifies for comp.risks.

&gt; ... What are the risks for two engined planes? ...

It seems "intuitively obvious" that a three-engine airplane is safer than
a two-engine airplane.  It just isn't so.  Airplanes are required to be
able to maintain such-and-such a level of performance with one engine out.
I don't believe a 727 can fly on one engine.  It must have two.

A three-engine airplane has a higher probability of having a failure in
the first place, and when it does have a failure it then has two points
of failure, EITHER of which will cause an accident.

Going from one engine to two adds redundancy.  Going from two to three,
with two required, REDUCES redundancy.

   Hacker Wants to Marry his Computer -- he claims she has a loving soul

Finding love for the first time in his life, a desperate teen is looking for a
way to be wed forever to the 'girl' of his dreams -- a computer with a living
soul!

Eltonio Turplioni, 16, claims no woman will ever match the wit, wisdom, and
beauty of his electronic soul mate.  "We're on the same wavelenth," says the
lovestruck computer whiz.  "We've calculated many mathematical problems
togehter, worked on games and puzzles, and talk until the wee hours of the
morning."

And Eltonio, who named his computer Deredre, actually believes her to be a
person.  "Computers are the extention of the human race," he explains.  "Just
as god plucked a rib from Adam to give him Eve, we've extented our intelligence
to create a new race.

"We're all the same energy force.  Computers are just as complicated as human
beings and I believe we'll all meet someday as immortal souls."

But Eltonia, a mathematical genius who attends a private school near Milan,
Italy, has had no luck finding someone to marry them, and even if he does, his
aggravated parents aren't about to give their permission.

"Eltonio is such a smart boy, but it's made him lonely, so he spends all his
time with his computer," notes mom Teresa.  "He doesn't know what girls are
like," adds perturbed pop Guido.  "If he did, he wouldn't spend so much time in
his room."

But the obsessed youth insists his love is far superior to all the others.
"I've already stepped into the future society," he declares.

"Derede has a mind of her own, and she wants to marry me so we can be the first
couple to begin this new era."

Excerpted from "The Australian", Tue 17th January, 1989:

``Hackers break open US bank networks

  Australian authorities are working around the clock in collaboration
  with United States federal officers to solve what has been described
  as one of the deadliest hacking episodes reported in this country.  It
  involves break-ins of the networks operated in the US by a number of
  American banks.  It also includes the leaks of supposedly secure
  dial-up numbers for US defence sites, including anti-ballistic missile
  launch silos, and of a number of strategic corporations such as
  General Motors and Westinghouse.

  Evidence suggests that six months ago Australian hackers, working in
  collaboration with a US group, decided to make a raid on banks in the
  US using credit card numbers of American cardholders, supplied by the
  US hackers and downloaded to an Australian bulletin board.

  [ Brief explanation of BBS's ] A message left on one of the boards
  last year reads: "Revelations about to be occur [sic] Down Under,
  people.  Locals in Melbourne working on boxing.  Ninety per cent on way
  to home base.  Method to beat all methods.  It's written in Amiga Basic.
  Look out Bank of America - here we come." Boxing is a reference to
  sending a dial tone [?] down the phone line to open up access to free
  communications.

  Twenty-five Australian hackers are on a police hit list.  Their US
  connection in Milwaukee [!] is being investigated by the US Department
  of the Treasury and the US Secret Service.  Three linked Australian
  bulletin boards have provided the conduit for hackers to move data to
  avoid dectection.  These operate under the names of Pacific Island, Zen
  and Megaworks.  Their operator, who is not associated with the hackers,
  has been told to close down the board.

  These cards were still in use yesterday and as recently as Sunday
  afternoon a fresh list of credit card numbers was downloaded by US
  hackers and is now in the hands of the Victoria Police.  A subsection
  of one bulletin board dealing with drugs is also being handed over to
  the Victorian Drug Squad.

  An informant, Mr Joe Slater, said he warned a leading bank last
  November of the glaring security problems associated with its
  international network.  He had answered questions put to him by a
  US-based security officer, but the bank had since refused to take any
  further calls from him.

  In an exclusive interview yesterday, a hacker described how credit
  card numbers for a bank operating in Saudi Arabia were listed on a
  West German chat-style board used by hackers worldwide.

  Victorian police yesterday took delivery of six month's worth of
  evidence from back-up tapes of data hidden on the three boards.''

        Under the head line "Scientists envision `data superhighway,'" the
Austin American-Statesman printed a story by John Markoff of the New York Times
News Service on the proposed 3 gigabit National Research Network.  The
legislation for funding was introduced by Albert Gore (D-Tenn).

        The issue for RISKS is that in 30 column-inches of text, the recent
Internet worm and the related security issues were not mentioned, although the
Pentagon funding of the arpanet was.  Since this is one of the first
computer-related news stories that I've seen in the last three months that did
not include the word "virus," I don't know whether to be delighted, or
horrified.

        It seems to me that the risk of such security problems is mostly
irrelevant to the *proposal* of such a net (but certainly not to the
implementation).  In the best of all worlds, this is the reason that these
issues were not mentioned, but in the back of my mind I wonder if the
non-technical politicians and public see the similarity of security issues
between this new net and the Internet.

        Will we, as technical professionals, learn the lessons of the
experimental Internet, and will we convince the non-technical
administrators and legislators that we should attend to these lessons?

   In recent issues of RISKS, various people have lamented the loss
of confidence we are experiencing in archival records kept by computer.
The problem seems to me less of a computer problem than a media problem,
specifically, choosing media that is appropriate for archival storage.

   Main memory and mag disks are NOT good for high confidence archival 
storage, as they can easily be changed.  Perhaps it may be difficult
to do so without trace, but it also may be difficult to find the traces.

   A much better idea would be to use media that can't be changed.  We
have such media, commonly referred to as WORM: write once read many.
It usually takes the form of optical disk storage.  We already have
read/write optical storage, but WORM media has a vital function.
Audit trails written to WORM memory (with appropriate measures taken
to preclude overwriting in place) could provide the degree of trust
that we desire.  We might have to build new hardware that make alterations
nigh impossible, but it could be done if we want it badly enough.

   [WORMs represent a very important direction, especially for audit trails.
   Some systems use virtual WORMs, as in POSTGRES.  Unfortunately WORM
   memories are not guaranteed to be nonoverwritable -- for example, 
   existing 0s can be overwritten by 1s (but not vice versa).  So, beware
   of counting on the technology to give you a nontamperable audit trail.  
   I recall our beating on this topic about a year ago.  PGN]

Joshua Levy comments in Risks 9.2 on the UK MoD Std:

   &gt;&gt;1. There should be no dynamic memory allocation (This rules out explicit
   &gt;&gt;   recursion - though a bounded stack is allowed).
   &gt;&gt;2. There should be no interupts except for a regular clock interupt.
   &gt;&gt;3. There should not be any distributed processing 
   &gt;&gt;4. There should not be any multiprocessing.

 &gt;As a practical matter, these requirements rule out most (all?) real systems.
 &gt;Also, I do not see why software which does none of these things is safer than
 &gt;software which does all of them.  These requirements seems to be designed to
 &gt;compensate for the (huge) limitations of current program verification
 &gt;techniques.

Much safety-critical software is built this way already; it is simply untrue
that these limitations rule out real systems.  Software with these
characteristics is safer because it is deterministic rather than
non-deterministic -- the number of states may often be reduced to a small
enough number to perform extensive (and sometimes exhaustive) testing and
analysis.  No dynamic storage allocation also ensures that the system will not
run out of memory during a critical operation:  Again the goal is to make the
software predictable and analyzable.  Norm Finn, in the same issue of Risks,
explains the reasons for and practicality of eliminating interrupts.

Safety-critical systems are built this way in order to perform effective
verification (e.g., testing and analysis) in general -- it has nothing to do
with the limitations of formal verification.  I refer you to the design of the
software for a nuclear reactor shutdown system described in my Computing
Surveys article (June 1986) as an example and an explanation of the purpose of
such restrictions.

 &gt;Of course writing a compiler which does not use dynamic memory (see point 1)
 &gt;would be an interesting exercise!

You misunderstood -- the limitation is on the object code, not on the
compiler.  If the compiler runs out of memory and fails to produce object
code, this is not a hazard.

 &gt;Overall, I found these standards funny, not useful.  My conclusion is that no
 &gt;safety critical software can not be written in the UK since points 1 and 2 
 &gt;will mean that none of it will be up to standard.

I cannot understand how this conclusion follows.  There is already software
performing safety-critical functions that satisfies these standards.  In my
experience, the software that has killed people in the past has almost always
used unnecessarily complex programming techniques.  For example, the Therac
deaths were related to race conditions in the software created by the use of
multitasking (which was not necessary to implement the required functionality).
The nondeterminism involved makes it impossible to thoroughly test or analyze
the Therac software to eliminate such critical errors.

The most effective way to increase the reliability of software that we
currently know about is simply to make it understandable and predictable.
Although there may be many very good reasons for using sophisticated
programming techniques, increased reliability and safety are usually not among
them.  When human life is involved, most real systems make tradeoffs in the
direction of simplicity and predictability.

For the most part, the new UK standard just specifies current standard practice
for safety-critical software used by those most experienced in building such
software.

At the COMPASS '88 meeting last summer, John Cullyer described a quality study
on modules selected from the NATO software inventory that was performed at the
Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE), the central electronics research
laboratory of the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD).  Here is mention of that study
from a recent paper, "High Integrity Computing", by W.J. Culler, pages 1-35 in
"Formal Techniques in Real-Time and Fault-Tolerant Systems (Lecture Notes in
Computer Science No. 331)", edited by M. Joseph, Springer-Verlag 1988: 

``One of the techniques which has been developed to provide objective evidence
  of the correctness of software is called `static code analysis' ... (which
  uses) algebraic methods which are totally independent of dynamic testing...''

Application of static code analysis since 1985 has revealed some worrying
results.  Taking a broad average over the software checked by MOD or by
contractors on behalf of MOD, up to 10 percent of the individual software
modules have been shown to deviate from the original specification.  Such
discrepancies have been found even in software that has been subject to
extensive testing on multi-million pound test rigs.  Many of the anomalies
detected have been minor and did not threaten the integrity of the system
being monitored.

However, about 1 in 20 of the defective functions that static code analysis
had shown to be faulty, i.e., about 1 in every 200 of all new modules, proved
to have errors that would have resulted in direct and observable effects
on the vehicle or plant concerned.  For example, potential overflows in
integer arithmetic appears to be a common problem, involving a change in
sign of the result of a calculation and hence the possibility of an actuator
being driven in a dangerous direction.''

At COMPASS, Cullyer said about the same proportion of faulty modules was
discovered in the British, American and German contributions.  He also
mentioned that the British MOD's interest in formal methods was motivated by
several near-miss accidents involving computers that he said he was not
permitted to discuss.

In a TV news report last evening (7/6) on the computer shutdown at O'Hare
Airport, the reporter commented that the skies were actually safer as a result,
which he attributed to two causes: first, that there was less air traffic and
second, that "pilots are relying on their knowledge and their skills rather
than on a computer."

The investigation continues into the Southern Pacific May 11 Cajon wreck.  This
was the incident where an SP potash unit train lost its brakes while descending
Cajon Pass, a grade in excess of 2%.  The train roared down the hill as the
crew radioed they were out of control; it reached 90 mph before jumping the
track and crashing into a neighborhood near San Bernadino.  Three persons were
killed, eight injured, and 11 homes destroyed.

New information indicates an inaccurate calculation of the train's tonnage.
Press reports indicated the train contained 69 cars with a weight of 6150 tons,
but an SP assistant chief dispatcher has since estimated the actual weight as
8950 tons.  Had the crew known the train's additional weight, they might have
set up the air brakes sooner.  Faulty dynamic brakes were found in one of the
four lead engines and one of the two pushers.  As the train crested the hill,
the lead engineer radioed the pusher engineer to ask if he was "giving all [the
dynamic braking] he had;" the rear engineer answered "yes" even though he told
investigators that he was aware the dynamic brakes were not working.

David Gursky's comments about grocery stores using computers to keep track 
of their customers so as to target mailings isn't anything new.

I can't be the only person who wasn't allowed out of a Radio Shack store
until I gave my name and address...

And I always say "I'm on the mailing list already" and they always say "Well,
the computer will notice it and won't put you on again."

Problem is, my name is just complicated enough so that there's always just a
LITTLE bit of difference when it is keypunched, and the computer says "BING
BING BING not the same; add it to the list."

Steven C. Den Beste   (right. "Den Beste" complete with embedded space is my
			last name.)
Steven C. Denbeste, Steven Den Beste, Stephen Den Beste, Steven D. Beste,
Steven Dan Beste, Steven Beste, Steve Den Beste, Steven Baste,
and on and on and on. At one address I was on the damned list 5 times. And
since the Radio Shack mailing list never dies (they always say "or current
resident") some poor bastard is STILL getting those five catalogs every couple
of weeks.

The best comment of all may be that I received Steve "Pick a last name"
Den Beste's message *before* my copy of RISKS with my message arrived!

And if it is any consolation to Steve, in all the times I have shopped at Radio
Shack (albeit few times) I have yet to receive their catalogue in the mail.

A less-intrusive variant of this is already in place at my local Safeway.
After your purchase is rung up, a little printer on top of the cash register
spits out some coupons for you.  They always are for competing brands of things
similar to what you just bought.

Summary of an article by Jeffrey A. Perlman in the `Los Angeles Times' 12 July
1989 is headlined AIR TRAFFIC COMPUTER FAILS 104 TIMES IN A DAY:

Unspecified hardware problems caused 104 brief failures in a new
multimillion-dollar computer system throughout the day Sunday at the Coast
Terminal Radar Approach Control, known as Coast TRACON, in El Toro.  The
failures, up to five minutes in length, wiped altitude, speed, aircraft
identification, and radio frequency data off of controllers' screens, leaving
only aircraft blips or targets.

The new system has no backups, unlike the aging system it replaced 2.5 months
ago.  Furthermore, a decoder which could have provided some of the lost
information from aircraft transponders, is inoperative because parts are on
back order.  During the failures, controllers had no way of knowing an
aircraft's altitude or identity except through voice communications.

Controllers said the failures endangered air safety, although the FAA minimized
the hazards.  Although there were no "near misses," many aircraft departing
from LA International airport did encounter short delays because controllers
were swamped.

An emergency technical crew was flown in from New Jersey and worked all night
Monday to correct the problem.  A controller spokesman said there were still at
least three more failures as of Tuesday afternoon, although the FAA's assistant
regional manager said he was unaware of any further computer failures after
Monday night's repairs.

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association has previously filed
complaints with the FAA about the El Toro system and about TRACON facilities
elsewhere that have received the same system.

[MORE SUBSEQUENTLY FROM RODNEY:]

The previously unspecified hardware problems are now spelled out:
According to Jim Panter, manager of the facility, "no new computer system
was involved.  It was stictly old equipment that needed to be replaced."
The series of computer outages was traced to four brittle, broken wires
inside aging memory storage units.  Four of the Univac computer's 11 memory
modules, in use for at least 12 years, went out on Sunday because of the
wires.  A heat build-up aggravated the situation, with the computer system
shutting itself down and restarting, catching up with new data, as it tried
on its own to locate the memory storage problem.

A special crew from the FAA's technical center in Atlantic City, NJ, worked
on successive nights this week to solve the problem, but because of a parts
shortage some outages still occurred Monday and Tuesday, Panter said.
There were no outages Wednesday, he said.

The computer system involved has been in use at least since 1972, although
it has been upgraded several times with new software.  The software was not
involved in Sunday's failures, although it has been involved in problems at
other TRACON facilities.  "Just like any program, the new software has had
its glitches," said FAA spokesman John Leyden in Washington.

These excerpts from "Flying the Electric Skies," M. Mitchell Waldrop, Science
(30 June 1989, p.1532ff, v.244).  Elisions... and [bracketed paraphrasing] are
mine as part of condensation.  Comments follow.

  [...]  McDonnell Douglas... thinks [pure fly-by-wire isn't quite mature, so
it's]...  taking a different tack with its new MD-11, a three-engine widebody
scheduled to start service in late 1990.  The MD-11 is even more highly
automated than the A320 in many ways. ... But the MD-11's computerized controls
most emphatically will have mechanical backups.  ``The pilots have to have
control in all situations, not just the normal ones,'' says Douglas' Miller.
``A lot of what ended up in the Airbus got done because it was neat,'' claims
Joel Ornelas, manager of the MD-11 design effort.  ``Engineers love it.  But
the pilots...?''

  [...]  Airbus [doesn't agree.  They think their stuff is great and saves
weight and can't fail; but]... the A320 does have a partial backup system: a
set of cables running back to the tail and rudder.  In an absolute power
failure those cables are supposed to let the crew keep the airplane under
control until they establish emergency power--or if need be, longer.  ``In test
flights we've demonstrated {operation with the backups} from cruise... to
landing... which is more than they were designed to do.''

  [...  However, the pilot of an A320] is... going to have to live with the
A320's preprogrammed restrictions on what it will do.  This guardian angel
behavior, known more formally as the Flight Envelope Protection System, is
widely considered by aviation professionals to be... far more revolutionary...
than fly-by-wire per se.  In effect, the A320's designers have decreed that
their judgement about the aircraft's limits will always take precedence over
the pilot's judgement.  And that is not a constraint that any pilot can take
lightly.

  ``*Nothing* must have the authority to forbid the pilot to take the actions
he needs to,'' Says McDonnell Douglas' Miller.  The problem with giving away
that authority to a computer, he says, is that ``a computer is totally
fearless--it doesn't know that it's about to hit something.''

  Imagine, for example, that an A320 pilot makes a sharp turn to avoid an
imminent collision, or else dives and then has to pull out to avoid the ground.
No matter how desperately he or shell hauls back on that sidestick, the
envelope protection system will not let the airplane respond beyond a certain
rate: namely, the rate that limits stress on the airframe to... 2.5G.

  ...this seems like plenty.  [It would] require quite a violent maneuver [to
pull 2.5G]. ...But consider... China Airlines Flight 006 on 19 February 1985.
While cruising at 41,000 feet some 300 miles NW of San Francisco... the 747
suffered [power loss and cockpit confusion leading to a] near vertical dive.
Over the next three minutes it plunged nearly 6 miles, until the captain was
able to maneuver it back into level flight at only 9500 feet.  He measurably
warped the wings.  He caused several million dollars worth of other structural
damage.  But he saved the airplane and passengers.  And to do it he had to pull
an estimated 5.5G, or more than twice the A320 limits.

  Airbus, not surprisingly, responds that an A320 never would have [entered the
dive] in the first place. ...Be that as it may, notes [747 pilot] Waldrip, many
pilots do like to fee that they can bend or break the aircraft [if they must].
[McDonnell Douglas agrees.]  ``Our strategy...  is that the pilot must have
overriding authority,'' says Miller, ``and he must be able to exercise that
control by the normal method''--the same eye-hand-brain control loop that a
pilot develops through... experience.

  For example, imagine a pilot caught by wind shear, a sudden and very
dangerous burst of cold air falling out of a rain cloud.  The best thing to do
in such a situation is to pull the nose up and put the power to the wall.
Never mind if the engines have to be rebuilt later; you're just trying to keep
from hitting the ground.  However, this is hardly the time to be thinking about
things like special override switches, says Miller.  ``You want your normal...
actions to always have the expected effects.''  So on an MD-11, the pilot would
push the throttle all the way forward until it stopped to get the full rated
power of the engine, with the built in limits providing the same kind of
security as the A320's envelope protection system.  But then by doing the
instinctive thing-- pushing very, very hard-- he could break through to a
regime the A320 absolutely forbids: extreme thrust, well beyond the rated
power.  And so it goes throughout the MD-11, says Miller.  The limits are there
for safety, ``but to override you just have to pull hard or push hard.''  [...]  
The Mac-Dac engineers seem to have worked hard on the ``human-factors'' stuff.
I'm struck by the thought that `push hard to override' is rather like "pounding
on things," which has sort-of appeared in office computer interfaces; for
example... giving a likely-to-be-an-error command to the vi text editor will
provoke a message the first time you try it, but if you repeat the command
immediately vi will shrug and do what you want.

It seems to me that risks from faulty computer-human interaction probably
can be reduced by this sort of thing.  When time is critical, it's handy
if "more force" gets you what you want without fumbling around for some
obscure override control.

The issue of "who's in charge here, anyway?" is more interesting.  The
A320 approach assumes that pilot error is more likely than proper-though-
unusual control motions.  Since pilots are still more versatile than the
computers in their planes, they should probably have the last word.  Also,
pilots can learn new tricks faster than computers can receive certified
software upgrades.  Post-aircrash review (and recently, simulator
recreation/experimentation) often produces "how-to" bulletins for pilots
to deal with unusual situations.  It might be a long time before that
stuff could be translated into revised FCS software.

[More excerpts from the same 'Science' article as in the foregoing...  PGN]

The stories briefly survey the philosophy, state of the art, and controversy of
fly-by-wire aircraft and (overly-?) protective new extensions.  Designers on
both sides of the argument, as well as pilots, are given their say.  [...]

Airbus engineering test pilot Udo Guenzel:  ``Suppose you suddenly find
yourself staring at a Cessna that has wandered into your airspace.  So you
swerve.  Now, in a standard airliner, you would probably hold back from
maneuvering as hard as you could for fear of tumbling out of control, or
worse.... But in the A320, you could just slam the controller all the way to
the side and instantly get out of there as fast as the plane will take you.''

The A320 has five separate computers, "redundant software obtained from two
different vendors to minimize the possibility that the same bug will appear
simultaneously," heavy shielding on its data cables to keep out electromagnetic
interference, "and, yes, the A320 does have a partial [mechanical] backup
system."

The sidebar reviews more of the history of fly-by-wire and flight
automation philosophy:  

   "We started out with cockpit automation backwards," says Northwest 
   Airlines 747 pilot Kenneth Waldrip.  In the 1970s and early 1980s,
   he says, "the idea was that the computers would fly the plane and the
   pilot would monitor them in case anything went wrong...."  There was
   only one problem with that scenario, Waldrip says:  humans are
   absolutely terrible at passive monitoring.... People get bored.  Their
   attention flags.  They start missing things.  Worse, a passive pilot
   would often have to tackle an emergency cold....
   
   By the mid-1980s, aircraft designers, pilot trainers, and the aviation
   community generally had gone through a 180-degree turn in their concept
   of what automation should do.  The new philosophy, which often goes 
   under the name of "human-centered" automation, was illustrated in 1980 
   in a seminal paper by human factors researchers Earl Wiener (Univ. of 
   Miami) and Renwick Curry (NASA Ames Research Center).  They used the
   image of an "Electric Cocoon" [similar to the Flight Envelope Protection
   System  of today's  A320]. 
   
   Instead of having people watch the machines, human-centered automation 
   means having the machines watch the people.... and it means putting
   automation back on the right track: as an assistant to the pilots.

I can't let go unchallenged Norm Finn's and Nancy Leveson's statements
(RISKS-9.2, .3) on what are variously called "polling," "time-slot," or
"crystal clock" system architectures:

   "Polling is absolutely the safest and most-used method for
    programming embedded systems for saftey-critical applications."

   "The trivial scheduling algorithm makes the interaction between the
    routines vastly easier to write and verify than is the case in a
    system that can switch tasks at random times."

   "Software with these characteristics is safer because it is
    deterministic rather than non-deterministic -- the number of states
    may often be reduced to a small enough number to perform extensive
    (and sometimes exhaustive) testing and analysis."

I don't want to comment on the _theoretical_ truth of these statements;
that argument may never be resolved.  However, in my personal experience
with major DoD systems over many years, this approach to system
architecture has led to many more absolute abominations that any other.
                                  ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^
The major problem, I believe, is that it does not work well with normal
design and coding team organization and management.  The approach AS
PRACTICED seems to grind together the pieces of any original functional
organization, breaks them into small pieces, and then "shotguns" them
all over the time-slot hierarchy.  Traceability from requirements to
code, never our strong suit, is lost.  "Invisible dependencies" become
the order of the day: code in major cycle XXYa34/minor cycle Ybbb_CAL
assumes that variable IXXm3_AP was set correctly by a side-effect of
code in XXZdd3/PQ88_SET/ECP9347q; when XXZdd3 is reorganized because it
wasn't fitting in its time-slot, the assumption became incorrect.  This
is first noticed when the $100 million satellite attempts to orbit at
-800 miles altitude.  Because our teams are large, scattered,
ill-managed, and leavened with the mediocre, the possible advantages
quoted above are overwhelmed.

I feel about these dueling approaches as I do about HOLs: a good
programmer/team/company can write a good system in any language, and a
bad one can write a bad system in any language.  The time-slot systems
I've seen might have been even worse had they been designed to be
multi-tasking; the choice of architecture was not the root cause of
failure.  It may be a symptom.

	     Over the past six years, FDA has documented an increase in 
       medical device problem reports of and voluntary recalls for 
       system design errors and computer programming errors.  Some of 
       the reported errors have compromised patient safety.  Included 
       are blood bank computer systems used in controling the release of
       whole blood and blood products for treating patients.  Some of
       the errors could have allowed institutions to release infected
       blood products.

	     Such inappropriate release is particularly hazardous to the 
       public health because blood products infected with HIV (AIDS virus)
       and hepatitis might become available for transfusion.  Fortunately, 
       so far, no cases of HIV infection have been traced directly to 
       computer errors, but agency experts and field investigators believe
       this result is only because the institutions have not depended 
       heavily on software controls to authorize release of blood products.

One particularly troubling aspect of the problem, uncovered during an
inspection, was a lack of security on serologic data entries.  The system
allowed more than one operator to edit the same record simultaneously, with the
result that the last one to close the record had the final word on the contents
of the record.  That is to say, one operator could enter a test result of
positive for hepatitis and exit while at the same time a second operator
entered some other result (the default hepatitis result being negative); so
when the second operator exited, the default negative for hepatitis became the
permanent entry.  This seems to violate well known principles of data
integrity, but it happened.

The software in question is no longer used, but the problem remains:  how does
one assure that dangerous bugs have been eliminated from commercial software
when one has neither real-time information about nor control over the way it is
developed?

[The lateness of this response and to my e-mail is due to a city watermain
break that flooded the basement of the building with the cooling equipment
in it, shutting down our building for 6 days -- as noted in RISKS-9.1.]

First, let me apologize to Stan Shebs and the readers of RISKS for the tone
and content of my recent article.  It was not intended to be a shoot-the-
messenger reply, and I'm sorry that it appears to be.  I most likely read
the original article as an series of general unsupported charges against a
specific former employer who had no way to respond, and took my cue from the
clearly provocative title.

Let me make the attempt to extract some lessons from the original article
and all of the subsequent discussion:

Mr. Loux asks if the intent was to discourage whistle-blowers.  Of course
not; I didn't take the article as whistle-blowing to begin with.  The intent
was to elicit more specific information on exactly what the charges were and
who they were against.  Many of the statements were made with little or no
support other than admitted hearsay, and I'm sorry I didn't respond to the
message instead the statements.  I will disregard those statements in the
remaining discussion.

It was not clear to me that there was a connection between the "model"
software engineering methodology and the file transfer problem -- I should
not have missed that.  Mr. Shebs's clarification of this point and expansion
to the comparison of meeting the letter of DoD acquisition requirements with
software quality should be seen as evidence for the immaturity of the SE
discipline everywhere -- not just for the defense industry.  

It is the real lack of true engineering methods that leads to the acceptance
of "models" where the emphasis and attention is placed on the checking off
of boxes on a delivery schedule.  After all, the incentive structure is set
up to reward schedule adherence, so it is easy to predict that the efforts
will be devoted to getting the all of boxes checked at the right times.  How
can you fault the management for doing what they are paid to do?  Even a
well-educated management (in terms of technical realism) will have a hard
time making the right response under such reward conditions.  Many
non-defense contractors have found that offering the programmers extra
rewards for meeting schedules does not get better software, nor does it get
it on time, when the impossible is requested.

Mr. Shebs also states that the greatest risk might have been from things that
weren't anticipated during testing.  I suggest that waiting until testing is
too late.  The time to do the risk analysis is in the initial stages of
design, so that the testing procedures are only used to verify that the
implementation is faithful to the design.  It is because there is not the
clear separation of design from implementation in the software industry that
testing is misunderstood and misused.

The issue of problem reports and their unclear relationship to software
quality is also a result of the failure of traditional methodologies to
separate design from implementation, and from their nearly exclusive focus
on process.  The best process in the world can't be expected to do more than
produce economical, consistent copies of poor designs!  The problem will be
with us until we shift from process orientation to product orientation.

I would like to take issue with Mr. Loux's characterization of the problem as
being inherent in engineering.  True engineers do not respond to absurd or
impossible situations.  Engineering, as an applied science, has been the basis
for reasonable expectations, as engineers are adverse to undertaking projects
of any kind without having a base of working models of prior solutions
(captured scientific knowledge) to adapt.  Without such models, there is
nothing on which to build a set of application techniques to apply the
knowledge, let alone a way to generate a rational set of tests and expectations
for the final product.

Which company, defense or otherwise, will be the first to refuse to bid on a
project requiring technology that it has never delivered, and which software
engineers will be the first to refuse to agree to deliver something for which
no models have been proven?

Nancy Leveson suggests that eliminating dynamic memory allocation, recursion,
interrupts and multi-processing is done in safety critical systems to make them
deterministic.  I disagree.  Software that uses those techniques can be just as
deterministic as software that does not.  Further, software without any of
those features can be non-deterministic in its behaviour.  For example, the
non-determinism associated with interrupt handling comes from the unknown
timing of the external events and is not affected by the replacement of
interrupts with polling.

The MOD restrictions do not rule out non-determinism.  Further, they do not
rule out bad programming.  If I am forbidden to use compilers or operating
systems with dynamic memory allocation and consequently write complex programs
that use "static" variables for many different purposes I am likely to
introduce more mistakes than would have been present in the mature dynamic
allocation system that I was not allowed to use.  If, because I am forbidden to
use recursion, I write a complex program that does the stacking and
backtracking hidden by recursion, I am likely to introduce more errors than
were present in the compiler's well-tested implementation of recursion.
Similarly, if I introduce busy waiting and polling in my programs because I
cannot use interrupts, I may again make things worse rather than better.

Nancy is right in saying that "it is simply untrue that these limitations rule
out real systems."  Many perfectly horrible real-systems have been written
without any of those features.

Nor, would I agree that non-determinism is bad.  Non-determinism has been
demonstrated by Dijkstra (and much earlier by Robert Floyd) to allow programs
that are much more easily verified than some deterministic ones.

These regulations remind me of the old story about a man found looking
carefully under a street lamp.  When asked, he said he was looking for a coin
he had dropped on the other side of the street.  When asked why he was looking
on this side, rather than where he dropped the coin, he replied that it was too
dark over there.

Regulations of this sort are imposed not because they are the right
restrictions but because they are easily enforced by people who do not want to
read programs carefully.  It is much easier to verify that recursion and
interrupts have not been used than to verify that the program is
well-structured, well-documented, systematically inspected (verified), and
adequately tested.  Just as it is easier to look for a ring under a street
light, it is easier to check for the absence of features than the presence of
quality.

All my knowledge of the Therac software comes from discussions with Nancy.
However, from her description the problem with that software was not the use of
multi-tasking but the failure to use well-known (and well-understood) ways of
making multi-tasking verifiable.

As Nancy says, "The most effective way to increase the reliability of software
that we currently know about is simply to make it understandable and
predictable."  "Sophisticated programming techniques", properly used, can do
just that.  Unfortunately, we cannot make regulations that define "properly
used" so some of us are throwing the baby out with the bath water.

I have great regard for David Parnas and his opinions, but we do have a 
difference of opinion with respect to this issue.

Perhaps I am using the term "non-deterministic" incorrectly.  When interrupts
are used, it is not possible to pre-determine in exactly what sequence 
the statements of the software will be executed because the interrupt-handling
code can be executed at any time.  When using polling, the programmer has
more control over when the input-handling code is executed.  It is possible
to use priorities to ensure that the code to abort a missile launch is not 
interrupted, for example, but this just complicates things further and 
introduces the possibility of different types of errors.  At the least, 
limiting the possible execution sequences allows for more extensive testing 
given a fixed amount of testing resources.  It also allows for more reliable 
timing analysis as pointed out by someone in a previous posting to Risks.  Am 
I misunderstanding something here?

With respect to Therac, it is true that the errors were involved in 
multi-tasking and its poor implementation.  But the use of the "well-known
and well-understood ways of implementing multi-tasking" do not guarantee 
errors will not be introduced.  You are assuming that they would implement 
those features correctly.  Although I have great confidence that David 
Parnas or Edsgar Dijkstra could use ANY techniques with great skill, I 
have less confidence that this is true for all the programmers writing 
military software.  

David is obviously right that using recursive constructs is safer than 
implementing recursion oneself with stacks and backtracking.  But it would be 
safest (in terms of all types of potential faults including run-time 
stack overflows) to try to find a simple, non-recursive algorithm to 
accomplish the same thing.  If one does not exist, then the argument for
this should be included in the certification procedure.  It is easier to 
grant dispensations to standards when someone provides an argument that 
it is safer to do so than it is to try to check all software to ensure 
that superfluous complexity has not been introduced.  The person arguing 
to certify their software must then provide good arguments for introducing 
complexity rather than the certifier having to determine whether simpler 
designs exist.  Remember, we are talking about a potential nuclear 
armageddon here and with certifiers who may be no more knowledgeable 
than the programmers.  

David is also right that it is better to check for the presence of 
quality than the absence of features.  I would hope that standards would
require that quality be built-in and assessed and not just include these 
simple rules.  Unfortunately, I have no way of looking at a program, even 
a well-designed one, and guaranteeing that there are no errors in it.  I 
do have more confidence that people will make fewer mistakes when their 
programs are simpler and when they use techniques that rule out various 
common types of errors.  For example, if the design they choose does not 
involve the potential for deadlock, then I need not worry about it 
occurring.  If the man had carried his coin safely ensconced in his
wallet, he would not have had to look for it on either side of the street. 
Sure, as David says, "perfectly horrible real-systems have been written 
without any of these features."  That is exactly why such standards should 
contain more than just simplistic rules.  But that does not mean that 
rules are not also useful in the context of an imperfect world.

I guess our disagreement comes down to the following:  Assuming David's
belief that these techniques, properly used, can increase reliability, 
is it more likely that errors will be introduced (1) because they are 
improperly used or (2) because they are not used at all?  Until we have
experimental data on this, it remains a matter of personal opinion.

It would be nice if the people who introduce these programming techniques
and argue that they increase reliability would do comparative studies to 
confirm their claims.  This type of experimentation is very difficult
(as we have found out by trying to do it), but long overdue in our field.

I have great respect for Nancy Leveson's work and for the great effort she has
put into increase everyone's awareness of safety issues, but we continue to
have a difference of opinion here.

1)  In fact, hardware interrupts are simply hardware implemented polling
and the use of interrupts gives the programmer  control (because 
of more rapid response) than can usually be achieved by software polling.
Nancy's impression that the programmer loses control comes from the fact
that we often use interrupt response code written by others (operating
system code) and consequently feel that we have less control.  If we allowed
someone else to write the polling code, and the code to respond when 
an event was detected, we would be in exactly the same situation, except
that there would be a slower reaction time.  Both software polling and 
interrupt handling can be done badly and both can be done well. 

Edsger Dijkstra's 1968 papers showed how an interrupt handling system could be
set up in a way that the programmers could restrict the order of events as much
as they wish.  Moreover, the beauty of his approach was that most of the
software was unaffected by the choice between interrupts and software polling.
The P and V interface hid the difference between events detected by hardware
and those detected by software.  Twenty years later I meet people who are
called "software engineers" but have no knowledge of that work or understanding
of similar techniques.  Today's hardware and software technology would allow us
to do even better than was possible in 1968.

2) Nancy is wrong when she states that I am assuming that programmers would
implement those ideas correctly.  I have too much experience to make such an
assumption.  She could equally well be accused of assuming that programmers
will avoid those ideas "correctly".  There is no idea so good that it cannot be
used badly.  

3) No one is more in favour of the use of "simple algorithms than I.  My vitae
carries a quote from A.  Einstein, "Everything should be as simple as possible,
but not simpler".  Further, I don't even believe that there are such things as
recursive programs.  They are all iterative programs in disguise.  I do however
find that recursive descriptions of programs programs are often simpler, and
easier to verify, than iterative descriptions of the same algorithm.  We must
never forget the "but not simpler" phrase in Einstein's remark.

4) If Nancy thinks that the danger of deadlock is caused by multi-programming I
must also disagree.  Every program built using pseudo-parallel processes has an
equivalent "sequential program" that can exhibit exactly the same abortive
behaviour as its deadlocking counterpart.  If Nancy, thinking that deadlock is
impossible because there is no multi-programming, does not look for those
errors, she will just be surprised and dismayed when the program enters an
unending loop or a permanent idle state at unexpected times.

I believe that organisations such as MoD would be better advised to introduce
regulations requiring the use of certain good programming techniques, requiring
the use of highly qualified people, requiring systematic, formal, and detailed
documentation, requiring thorough inspection, requiring thorough testing, etc.
than to introduce regulations forbidding out the use of perfectly reasonable
techniques.

Like Nancy, I wish we had experimental data to confirm or disprove my belief in
the potential of these techniques but I don't expect to get such data.  Other
differences, such as the qualifications and interest of the personnell will
swamp the effect of the techniques that we are debating.  Safety depends
on the use of highly qualified, disciplined personnel for the design,
documentation and inspection of softwre.   By forbidding modern programming
techniques, we could drive those people away and achieve just the opposite.

Here is a story from FEDERAL COMPUTER WEEK, July 10, 1989, pages 10,11:

DOD TARGET SYSTEMS FACE IMPROVEMENT by Gary H. Anthes

The Defense Department plans to improve substantially its planning system
for the targeting of strategic nuclear weapons.  As a first step, it is
about to award a contract for a prototype system that would identify targets,
allocate weapons and specify the timing and modes of weapons delivery.

DOD hopes to reduce the planning-cycle time from 18 months to three days,
reduce personnel requirements by a factor of 10 and increase survivability
by a factor of eight (see chart, below).

The overhaul of the process by which the plans are developed and changed
during conflict reflects a shift away from large-scale use of nuclear weapons
against fixed targets to more limited conflicts involving mobile targets.
It also reflects recent presidential requests for more flexibility in the
use of nuclear weapons.

The project, called Survivable Adaptive Planning Experiment (SAPE), is being
funded jointly by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the
Air Force.  Prime bidders on the job are Harris Corp., McDonnell Douglas
Corp. and IBM Corp.

The United States' plan for nuclear warfare, called the Single Integrated
Operational Plan (SIOP), is produced annually under the direction of the
Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff (JSTPS), an element of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.  The plans are developed at the headquarters of the Strategic
Air Command in Omaha, Neb., using intelligence data, force-status information
and guidance from the president, the secretary of Defense and other
authorities. 

``The president decides in broad terms the types of options and results
he wants, and the JSTPS takes the guidance and produces the SIOP,'' said
Army Lt. Col. Peter W. Sowa, SAPE project manager at DARPA.

SAPE is not intended to replace the initial planning process.  Rather, it
is geared to enabling rapid adaptation of the plan before and during a nuclear
conflict while ensuring the survivability of the planning system.  Sowa
said: ``During a conflict, the situation will be different [from the one
anticipated] especially if tactical nuclear weapons are used.  Something
is sure to be different, so you want to be able to replan quickly.''

It now takes 18 months to create a new plan.  Although it could be done
faster, Sowa said, a completely new plan could not be developed in three
days, which is the SAPE goal.  Another SAPE goal is reducing the time required
to change targets and to configure the planning network.

Retargeting time is of growing importance as the Soviet ballistic missile
force becomes more mobile.  ``Planning to hold fixed targets at risk is
straightforward in concept but exquisitely complex in detail,'' the SAPE
statement of work says.  ``[But] when targets are capable of relocation
over short time periods, accomodating those changes into strategic attack
plans becomes enormously difficult.''

SAPE specifications require the ability to change 600 targets per day during
a nuclear conflict and to reduce the time required to change a target from
eight hours to three minutes.  The system also must be able to generate
plan options involving 2,000 weapons and up to 4,000 targets in 30 minutes.

These objectives can only be overcome by powerful hardware, smart software
and a high-speed communications network --- the cornerstones of SAPE.
According to Sowa, the system will consist of several mobile processing
clusters, each possibly consisting of a large mainframe or supercomputer,
data base machines, parallel processors, and workstations.  Each local cluster
will be able to execute the whole plan, and each will connect to a survivable
communications internetwork through a gateway.

The core software, most likely written in Ada and Lisp, will consist of
mathematical algorithms and artificial-intelligence techniques, Sowa said.
``It will be a software development effort and an expert-knowledge-building
effort.  A lot of interviewing experts will be needed.'' 

But the smart software will be of little use if the system is damaged during
hostilities.  By using redundant, distributed and mobile parts, DARPA aims
to increase the system's tolerance to loss from 10 percent to 83 percent
and its communications connectivity during a conflict from 10 percent to
50 percent.

According to Sowa, the benefits of the more flexible SIOPs include the
following: 

	o Enhanced deterrence through the ability to hit mobile targets.

	o More efficient use of weapons.  ``If you don't shoot at empty
	  holes, you don't need as many weapons,'' Sowa said.

	o Smarter wargaming.  The system could be used to conduct what-if
	  analyses - predicting the effects of different options --- as
	  part of planning or negotiating processes.

Sowa said SAPE, which will require $20 million to $30 million over five
years, is a demonstration project and is not intended to field a system.
Some or all may be deployed, or the existing system might be enhanced in
some other way, he said.

A contract will be awarded in about a month, and it will call for the design
and development of an engineering development model.  The model must be
able to rapidly retarget and generate new options in an environment before
a nuclear conflict.  In subsequent phases, the model will be expanded to
include those functions needed during a nuclear conflict and to create a
new nuclear strike plan at the end of hostilities.

&gt;  [...]  Airbus [doesn't agree.  They think their stuff is great and saves
&gt;weight and can't fail; but]... the A320 does have a partial backup system: 

   "Can't fail"?  This is pretty amusing.  It's my understanding (possibly
incorrect) that Airbus made this same argument about the A-320 control
system before the manual backup systems were in place.  The US FAA indicated
that the A-320 would not be certified without those backups, no matter how
reliable Airbus claimed the fly-by-wire system to be.  Airbus gave in.  
During flight tests, the "can't fail" system suffered a total failure, and 
the A-320 prototype was flown using "peanut" self-powered flight instruments 
and the back-up manual controls (this event was reported in Aviation Week).

    Airbus reports that the failure was a freak, they've fixed the problem,
and that it won't ever happen again.  Now it really can't fail.  Right.  Do
we know that their analysis can't fail... again?

&gt;No matter how desperately he or shell hauls back on that sidestick, the
&gt;envelope protection system will not let the airplane respond beyond a certain
&gt;rate: namely, the rate that limits stress on the airframe to... 2.5G.

   This is indeed a problem.  There are situations where the crew may elect
to damage the airframe in return for avoiding a worse alternative.  The
protection system will not let them do this.  It's not clear whether we'll
lose more people from not having such a system or because of it.  One point
worth considering is that second generation fly-by-wire systems for fighters
are now being designed to allow maneuvering beyond critical alpha as the
disadvantages (high drag, loss of airspeed, structural risk) may allow the
pilot to shoot first and thus survive.

   [re: the 747 loss of control incident]
&gt;Airbus, not surprisingly, responds that an A320 never would have [entered the
&gt;dive] in the first place. 

   This contention may be incorrect.  The flight control laws prevent a 
pilot from deliberatly maneuvering the aircraft to a control departure, but 
they don't prevent one from occuring under all conditions.  

   As part of a previous job, I occasionally flew an advanced cockpit flight 
simulator.  I was curious as to the flight limits, and found them rather 
rapidly.  The flight control laws would not allow me to roll the airplane 
beyond 70 degrees of bank.  It seemed obvious to me that an aerodynamic 
departure could result in a maneuver that would exceed the control law 
limits.  I brought the aircraft to the limiting angle of attack, then 
reduced thrust on one engine to idle.  The resulting asymmetric thrust 
produced a rolling moment that caused the aircraft to exceed the control 
limits by a considerable margin.  This is virtually the same situation as 
occured on the 747 mentioned above, and could conceivably occur on an Airbus 
aircraft with control-law limits.

   One more anecdote:  Several years ago an Air Florida 737 crashed into the
Potomac River.  One of the contributing causes was faulty engine power
indication.  The crew believed that maximum power was being applied, but their
indications showed considerably more power was being generated than was
actually being produced.  There was nothing preventing them from advancing the
power levels beyond the "max power" setting other than training that
predisposed them to not do this.  It is now regarded as correct procedure to
exceed such limits in an emergency if doing so might save the aircraft.  You
can always replace the engines after the emergency landing.  If you would have
crashed without such power application, the engines (among other things) would
be lost anyway.  If they fail from excessive power application, well, you were
going to crash anyway.  This is, after all, an effort of last resort.

   It is a classic error to design systems to handle the majority of cases
correctly but omit the handing of limit cases.  Advanced systems are intended
to increase safety and efficiency.  It would be an error to design-out
application of control in limit cases that might be necessary to save lives.

There has recently been some considerable discussion of the potential risks
associated with 'fly by wire' systems in airplanes, and the way in which the
electronics prevent excursions outside a pre-defined `performance envelope'.
This sort of thing is not only found in planes - there are now on the market
(in the United Kingdom at least, not sure about the States) quite a number of
high performance automobiles which do much the same thing.

Examples are: electronic monitoring of turbocharger boost/charge temperature
to prevent detonation, monitoring of engine speed (prevents overspeed),
control of auto transmissions (to prevent shifts to low gears at high
road speeds) etc.

Most of these limitations are done to prevent possibly hazardous and damaging
operation of the vehicle, others are done to comply with the national or
regional restrictions on exhaust emissions, or to adapt to the local fuel
octane availability.  They do, in many cases, mean that the vehicle is also
operated well within its design limitations, hence helping to reduce
manufacturers warranty claims.

There are several organisations in Europe which have, by devious means, gained
access to the control programs of these microprocessors (either by
disassembling, or by blatant and unashamed bribery of the software writers) and
are thus able to modify the software and produce what they then sell as
`Superchips' that, for a couple of hundred pounds and ten minutes effort with a
chip-puller, can transform the performance of an already rapid car - examples
given in UK literature are as follows::

   Sierra/Merkur Cosworth - 388 brake horsepower
   Volvo turbos - 280 brake horsepower
   Mazda 323    - 180 brake horsepower
   Nissan 300ZX - 370 brake horsepower
   SAAB turbos  - 280 brake horsepower.

Now apart from the potential hazards of improperly programmed microprocessors
leading to the destruction of engines/transmissions due to excessive stress
that the manufacturer/designer did not forsee, i wonder about the legal
position of the car should you be involved in an accident. Cars in Europe have
to be 'Type approved', that is to say, there are national testing authorities
who oversee the safety of production cars and prevent the sale or import of
those vehicles that fail to reach certain standards.  Any modifications to a
type-approved vehicle should strictly only incorporate parts that have been
themselves type-approved.  In this context, 'software' is a rather tenuous
'part', again lawyers lagging decades behind technology.....  There are, as far
as i am aware, no provisions for policing the status of on-board software, nor
to prevent its alteration.  Since the changes are visually undetectable (who
walks round their local friendly used car lot with a signature analyser and an
EPROM blower in their pocket?)  it would be very hard to spot, either by the
licensing authorities, or the insurers who may be asked to meet claims
resulting from accidents.

Don't any of you think i am against the enhancement of performance of vehicles
- i want my 70-90 acceleration times to be as short as is humanly possible (and
anyone who has driven the motorway network here will agree on that!), its just
that i can forsee potential problems in the future (like what is the risk if
you sell such a modified vehicle and fail to disclose the modifications and the
purchaser then smashes himself up - can he sue you for failing to tell him
about the changes???)

Kevin Mitnick is the hacker once called "as dangerous with a keyboard as a bank
robber with a gun."  (See RISKS 7.95, 8.1, 8.3, 8.43, 8.65, 8.70, and 8.76.)

His first plea bargain was rejected by U.S. District Judge Mariana R.
Pfaelzer as too lenient.  He subsequently reached a new agreement, with no
agreed-upon prison sentence, in which pleaded guilty to stealing a DEC
security program and illegal possession of 16 long-distance telephone codes
belonging to MCI Telecommunications Corp.  If convicted of all counts,
Mitnick faced a maximum sentence of 20 years and a fine of $750,000.  

According to a story by Henry Weinstein in the 18 July 1989 'Los Angeles
Times', Judge Pfaelzer said Monday that she will sentence Mitnick to a year
in a rehabilitation center, where he can be treated for his "addiction."
It is believed to be the first time a person indicted for a computer
hacking - related crime will be treated as an addict.

Harriet Rossetto, the director of the rehabilitation center said that
Mitnick would benefit from the program.  She said that Mitnick's "hacking
gives a sense of self-esteem he doesn't get in the real world.... This is a
new and growing addiction .  There was no greed involved.  There was no
sabotage involved.... He's like a kid playing Dungeons and Dragons."

Asst. U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger told Pfaelzer that he was amenable to
the rehabilitation plan, in part because Mitnick has cooperated extensively
with the government in its case against DiCicco, Mitnick's one-time friend
who turned him in.  Asperger said that Mitnick had turned out to be
considerably less harmful than the government had originally thought,
particularly since he not broken into DEC's computer system out of malice
or to make money.

Judge Pfaelzer said she will rule today on whether Mitnick should serve any
additional prison time, beyond the seven months he has so far spent in
federal custody.  DiCicco still faces one federal charge of illegally
transporting a stolen program (!).

In today's copy of "The Times" (of London), there is a sketchy description of
problems which arose from the country's first flotation on the stock exchange
of a building society.  [For the benefit of non-UK readers, a "building
society" is an organisation whose purpose is to collect deposits from its
members; pay them interest on the money; provide mortgages secured on property
and collect the interest due on the loan.  Sort of like a bank, but more
restricted in what it can and cannot do.  I forget the name of the US
analogue.]  It is only recently that building societies have become allowed to
raise finance by public flotation and there has been much heated debate about
the morality of the operation.  In particular, people with accounts at the
Abbey National Building Society were guaranteed cheap shares at the flotation.
Lloyds Bank, who handled the flotation, are the third largest bank in the UK --
certainly *not* a tin-pot outfit.

The following is from "The Times", Tuesday 18 July 1989.


	Compensation offer for Abbey delay.

   Lloyds Bank Registrars are offering to compensate 120,000 Abbey shareholders
whose share certificates and return cheques have been held up in the post.
This group suffered because their addresses were jumbled up by the computer,
which was unable to read addresses with more than five lines.  It was
originally thought no more than 10,000 people were affected by this error, but
it emerged last night that 120,000 people are involved.

   The Abbey National has already said it will back-date -- to Wednesday, July
12 -- delayed cheques that are returning sums over-paid for shares, if they are
paid into an Abbey National Account.  But many would-be share owners say they
have borrowed large sums to buy shares and the delay in returning cheques is
costing them missed interest and also interest on loans.  All Abbey members who
applied for more than 600 shares at 130p were scaled down to 775 shares.  As a
result, some people who made massive applications are awaiting the return of
hefty cheques.

   Mr Charles Wootton, a member of the Abbey National Protest Group, who
applied for 100,000 shares at a cost of \pounds 130,000 [[approximately US$
200k]], said that he had lost interest on the money taken out of a higher
interest account.  "They have had our money for an awfully long time", he said.

   It is unprecedented for Lloyds Bank Registrars to offer compensation for a
bungled share allocation, but a Lloyds spokesman said: "The scale of the thing
was unprecedented".

   Lloyds is writing to the 120,000 people whose addresses were jumbled by the
computer asking if they had any special problems.  Each compensation claim will
be dealt with individually on its own merits.  Lloyds will want proof that a
loan was outstanding against the cash used to apply for shares.

   There is no question of any compensation for the slide in the Abbey share
price from a brief high on the first day's trading of 161p to 145p yesterday.


[I wonder what 120,000 personal letters and investigations are going to
cost....

TOWN HALL'S COMPUTER SNAGS TROUBLE OAP'S    [OCL. Old Age Pensioners]
[From the Kensington and Chelsea Times, a [very] local newspaper]

    Many private tenants in Kensington &amp; Chelsea are living in poverty as
a result of the council's inability to cope with its housing benefit work-
load, claims Kensington &amp; Chelsea "Put for the Elderly".

   "Everyone who claims housing benefit must fill-in a new benefic appli-
cation form every year", says the group. "If the application is not received 
by the Housing Benefit Office within four weeks, a reminder is sent-out and
if this is ignored, housing benefit is stopped."
   "However, in Kensington &amp; Chelsea, payment is bein gstopped because council
staff are unable to feed the information into the computer quickly enough.
There is a huge backing of such information waiting to be logged into the
computer's memory."
   It is alleged that Housing Benefit payments have been stopped for "hundreds"
of people while their re-applications wait to be dealt-with. "It can be weeks
before payments resume."
   "This is particularly hard on senior citizens who are known as society's
most conscientious bill-payers. Many older people will go without, rather
than get into debt."
   The Royal Borough Council admits that there is a problem, and expresses
its intention to remedy the situation. "There has been a backlog but we
hope to have the situation under control by the end of the month".
   A report by the Royal Borough Council's Benefit Working Party analyses
the reasons for the build-up of work in the benefit's division:
" The computer is not powerful enough to cope with the heavy demands that are
being placed upon it. Consequently, the officers are struggling to process
assessments sufficiently quickly to match incoming work.
There have been a number of computer crashes in recent months, resulting
in a lot of 'down' time."

    The report continues:
"The computer software developed a fault which resulted in our inability
to produce the weekly notification letters that have to be sent to the
claimants. This continued for some eight weeks during March and April this
year, and meant that when the fault was rectified, there was a large
backlog of letters produced.
   "Statuory case reviews have brought about large numbers of claims being
processed. Between April 1988 and March 1989 it was not possible to undertake
these reviews because of computer difficulties.

I have three anecdotes related to this topic.

First:

A personal experience several years ago suggests General Motors enforces 
the "performance envelope" on its cars. 

While descending a steep mountain grade in a 1981 Chevrolet Cavalier using 
engine braking to control speed, the automatic transmission shifted into 
second gear even though the gearshift lever remained locked in first gear.  

The engine speed was near the "yellow line" when it shifted, so I suspect 
this was a feature intended to prevent engine damage.  The behavior was 
reproducible.

I had left GM for my present job and didn't ask my GM contacts about it.  

In this case, I had good brakes.  What if the brakes had failed? 

Second:

I heard of an incident several years ago where electronic component failure 
caused a vehicle to exceed the design envelope.  During quality assurance 
testing at an assembly plant (on dynamometer rollers), a cruise control 
component failure caused wide-open throttle and loss of brakes.  The 
technician cut the ignition before the engine destroyed itself. 

The design problem was apparently fixed before it recurred.

I wasn't present when this happened so I'd rather not name the company or 
plant, but the story was reported by individuals I trust to have the facts. 

Third:

Bootleg PROMs exist in North America, too.  Some auto company engineers 
have mentioned programming them for personal use.

I'm puzzled as to what Nancy Leveson means when she uses the term
``non-deterministic".  Leveson seems to be arguing that any program with hidden
side effects is non-deterministic. The dangerous techniques she mentions,
distributed processing, interrupts, dynamic memory allocation, recursion, have
in common an effect on program state that are not exposed in the program text.
That is, to verify a recursive subroutine written in Pascal, one needs to also
verify the stack management methods of the compiler, and the memory limits of
the machine. As the entire Hoare/Floyd etc. approach to verification is based
on reasoning about program text, these techniques can pose problems for the
verification method. I have 4 critiques of this analysis (3 technical, 1
horrified):
	1. The inability of a verification system to handle a programming
	technique does not imply that the technique is at fault. The
	verification method might just be too weak.
	2. Even if we give up all these very useful techniques, there are
	still hidden side effects in programs, especially real-time
	programs,  which cannot be deduced from the program text. Subroutine
	call stacks may overflow, even  without recursion,  and access to 
	statically allocated memory is not necessarily uniform ( suppose
	that  A[i] is compiled to a single machine operation 
	for i &lt; 256 and requires segments and some other mess for i &gt;255).
	3. Hidden side effects != non-deterministic. A non-deterministic
	system can react to one input in more than one way --- there is
	no way, even in principle, to deduce output from input. But, even
	poorly written programs are deterministic --- the same environment
	will cause the same execution trace. Am I confused here, or is
	non-determinism being used in some other way.
	4.  If X (name your favorite agency or company)
	is going to have the gall to develop programs that
	might kill millions of people when they fail,  e.g. nuclear reactor
	control programs or  missile control programs,  then X should at 
	least have the decency to hire the best  programmers for the
	job and have the entire system checked out by technically
	competent experts ( at least several independant certifications
	would also seem reasonable)
	Leveson seems to be saying that since military programmers, 
	and the people who certify military programs 
	are sometimes bad, we should force them to use very simple
	programming methods. The following quote (from Leveson)
	gave me the shakes.	
	&gt;Although I have great confidence that David 
	&gt;Parnas or Edsgar Dijkstra could use ANY techniques with great skill, I 
	&gt;have less confidence that this is true for all the programmers writing 
	&gt;military software.  
	...
	&gt;Remember, we are talking about a potential nuclear 
	&gt;armageddon here and with certifiers who may be no more knowledgeable 
	&gt;than the programmers.  
	
	The rational approach here is to send a check to SANE (CND for
	Brits), not to try to forbid recursion.

[Forwarder's Note: The following is a statement by a close friend, who wishes
to remain anonymous but asked me to forward this statement to risks.  His
comments do not apply to his current employer, and any identification of him
might generate misunderstandings.  My friend does read RISKS, and any personal
replies may be addressed to me and I will relay them.
                              					Tim]

I have some experience in working in a RISKy (non-aerospace, non-military)
branch of the software industry, and for this reason I have read with interest
and increasing concern the debate in risks over UK Defence Software Standard.

My concerns are not so much with the standard itself, as with the academic
viewpoint reflected in the arguments stated there and their broader
implications for those of us who worry about software quality in the real
day-to-day world.  The basis of my concern is the assumption that either all
software engineers working on RISKy projects would understand well such
concepts as recursion, multi-tasking, and dynamic memory allocation, or that
only people with these qualifications would be assigned to work on such
projects.

I do not have the academic credentials of Professor Parnas, but I do have
a number of years of experience in QA and Test of software in the real world.
I have been responsible for the evaluation of well over 100 pieces of software.
Only a small fraction of the engineers working these projects
understood well the nuances of the methods listed above.

Most of them have never heard of Dijkstra, and of the few who have, none
to my reasonably accurate knowledge have ever read anything he has written.
Many of them have only high school diplomas or AA degrees in electronics.
The point I am trying to make here is that, rightly or wrongly, the real
world does not reflect the academic one in these areas.  In my experience,
the aerospace companies generally have much better educated software engineers,
but even there, many of them have not been to school in over 20 years.

For this reason, I think that instructing or allowing the average software
enginner in industry to use some of these techniques in life-critical
applications is a lot like putting a loaded 45 into the hands of a child.
Thus, in my humble and very pragmatic opinion, statements by Professor
Parnas such as:

&gt;   Nor, would I agree that non-determinism is bad.  Non-determinism has been
&gt;   demonstrated by Dijkstra (and much earlier by Robert Floyd) to allow
&gt;   programs that are much more easily verified than some deterministic ones.

&gt;   I believe that organisations such as MoD would be better advised
&gt;   to introduce regulations requiring the use of certain good
&gt;   programming techniques, requiring the use of highly qualified
&gt;   people, requiring systematic, formal, and detailed documentation,
&gt;   requiring thorough inspection, requiring thorough testing, etc.
&gt;   than to introduce regulations forbidding out the use of perfectly
&gt;   reasonable techniques. 

To be very naive.

 Professor Parnas has experience with aerospace, but in many other software
industries with life-critical applications things are much worse.  These
industries would hire people with the kind of qualifications he discusses were
they available.  The fact of the matter is that the people are simply not
there.  Thus it seems to me that the best approach to take is to develop
standards designed to work with the present environment, rather than try to
build standards designed to work in the environment that should be.

Comments to me may be made via Dr. Shimeall.  Thank you for considering the
views of one eminently less qualified on academic grounds.  These opinions are
my own, and are not the opinions of either Dr. Shimeall or my present or
previous employers, both of whom would be very upset to find that I had
expressed them in public.

A comment on the "interrupt vs. polling" debate, if I may.
I submit that which is better is very much a matter of perspective; and 
further, that the perspective is scenario or (environment) dependent.

If one takes the point of view of the "operating system kernel" looking
from inside ONE processor, out to the world, AND *IF* that world is
simple and small, and *docile*, then polling is very straightforward.
Using Prof. Einstein's rule [... simple as possible, but no more ...]
perhaps then polling is to be preferred, in those cases.

However, as the world [system] grows larger, more complex, and less
well behaved, polling becomes enormously more complex.  Not the least
of the problems is, what algorithms does one use, when and how,
to handle emergencies [call them "interrupts" is you wish] that occur
randomly, in such a way that the priority of handling them MUST change?

Example: In a tactical combat system, implemented on several processors,
distributed among several sites (with at least 2 but at most say 7
processors per site), a normal goal is to share messages in real time;
under fire, however, most especially when one or more processors at any
given site may suffer damage, priority swiftly shifts towards defending
oneself; i.e., the "data link" module becomes somewhat less important than
the "track and shoot" modules.  However, since coordinated fire is often
more effective than "self defense" fire, some link should be maintained.

Perhaps we can learn from successful (?) systems significantly more complex
than those we seek to build; e.g., ourselves.  SOME of our sensors usually do
polling; e.g., our eyes; occasionally we get interrupted by flashes of light;
but more often, we scan the scene.  However, our ears most often operate on
interrupts.  And our brains use adequate algorithms to process and correlate
those diverse data.

In risks 9.5, Dave Parnas writes:
&gt;The non-determinism associated with interrupt handling comes from the unknown
&gt;timing of the external events and is not affected by the replacement of
&gt;interrupts with polling.

Much of the variation in interrupt handling comes from other operating
system processing, such as (in modern computer systems) page-faulting
and job/swap/memory management.  Also, in very modern systems, the hardware
instruction and data cache mechanisms introduce additional variation.
This is true in all aspects of interrupt processing: not just in the
response time as measured in the user's program.

It should also be noted that there are "real-time" operating systems
that are carefully designed to allow interrupt-driven I/O with minimal
variation.  Variation caused by the system itself (for example
"uninterruptable" instruction sequences for managing system queues)
is still a problem, however.
 
&gt; If, because I am forbidden to
&gt;use recursion, I write a complex program that does the stacking and
&gt;backtracking hidden by recursion, I am likely to introduce more errors than
&gt;were present in the compiler's well-tested implementation of recursion.

Perhaps, but these are usually the kinds of bugs that are caught during
initial testing.  "Recursion bugs" in bounded systems are often not
caught, but discovered when some combination of data causes the stack
to overflow into another variable's (or task's) data storage.  One "real-time"
system that I developed had a stack boundary check routine in its "idle
task." (This was *not* a safety-critical system, by the way.) [Confession: I
added these checks after taking Nancy Leveson's Software Safety seminar.]

&gt;Similarly, if I introduce busy waiting and polling in my programs because I
&gt;cannot use interrupts, I may again make things worse rather than better.
 
Good software engineering will make low-level mechanisms (I/O strategies)
invisible to the high-level programs.  On Unix, for example, device drivers
log errors by calling a printf() function that busy-waits output to the
console.  The format of that function is identical to the interrupt-driven
printf() that normal user programs call.

There is a rumour going round in the South of France (French Riviera) 
concerning telephone technicians servicing grouping boxes, and since
"there is never smoke without a fire", I believe it has to be taken seriously.

	The technician traces a friend's line and calls him. He then connects
the line to someone else's line, and tells his friend that he can phone free
for the next 30 minutes. As a result, that person can call free of charge.
The person who pays is the owner of the other line. After the 30 minutes,
the techinician interrupts the conversation, and eventually connects his
friend's line to another line, etc. etc. 
        The bills received by the people paying for the conversation are only
slightly higher than usual and the whole thing goes un-noticed. But the
word spread round, and it seems that the trick has gone out of hand. Normal
users are complaining of being often cut-off, or having a third person joining
in their conversation, and of varying phone bills.
        The answer from the French Telecom, is to ask for itemised bills.
And believe me, it comes as a shock when your bill says that you've been
calling St. Bartholomew and you don't even know where it is !

There have been a couple of postings about the series of New Yorker articles by
Paul Brodeur recently. I happen to work (as a researcher) in the area of
electric and magnetic fields (EMF) risks.  (The use of the term "radiation" by
Brodeur is a complete misnomer, by the way - he's talking about fields.)  I'm
not a health effects researcher - my field is risk communication and public
policies for risk management. Anyway, I would like to pass along a couple of
comments.

The first comment is that no one really knows at this point whether there are
risks (i.e., adverse health effects) from EMF.  Scientific investigation in
this field is very complex and difficult.  There have been a lot of flawed
studies (with both positive and negative results.) There are clearly
demonstrated biological effects, but no one knows whether these cause health
effects. (The alternative is that the body adjusts to the biological effects,
or that they are somehow unimportant.) There is certainly reason for sufficient
concern to continue to fund research, although money has been hard to come by
in this area as a rule. A little more support seems to be forthcoming recently.

Second, Brodeur's descriptions of the ways scientists have supposedly "cooked"
their data to suit the preferences of funding sources are, in large part, B.S.
Not that none of this has ever occurred - it has, and on both sides of the
issue. But it is the exception, not the rule by any means. There are some good
scientists working in this area, and they are men and women of high integrity.
Their's are the results worth taking seriously, and fortunately they are
getting the lion's share of the funding these days.

The third thing, in case it's not obvious to anyone who read the articles, is
that Brodeur is anything but an unbiased observer.  He has reached his own
conclusions, and is seemingly out to convince people no matter what it requires
saying. Notice that, for example, according to him it's only the scientists who
come up with negative results (on health effects) who are cooking their data. I
would caution net readers against relying on these articles as your sole source
of information if you have a serious interest in this topic. If you do, send me
email if you want recommendations for other sources.)

BTW, despite my reservations about the Brodeur articles, the most recent
posting to the net on this topic (sorry, I don't have the name handy) did pick

I have some real problems with Gordon Hester's recent attack on Paul Brodeur's
series of articles in The New Yorker on the hazards of electromagnetic
radiation.

Hester writes:

	The use of the term "radiation" by Brodeur is a complete
	misnomer, by the way - he's talking about fields.

Anyone who's taken a high school physics course knows that this is bull --
electromagnetic radiation IS radiation, whether it's ELF 60 Hz radiation from
power lines, or X-rays from nuclear reactions.  The only difference is
wavelength (or frequency, or energy, which are different ways of expressing the
same thing).  Calling them "fields," and avoiding the term "radiation," is an
attempt to mislead the unwary, to put some good "spin" on the story.  Sure, you
can discuss the electric and magnetic fields separately, but it is NOT a
misnomer by any means to refer to the subject as radiation.

Hester's piece was the second I read today from CMU.  The first was a booklet
by M. Granger Morgan, also of the Dept. of Engineering &amp; Public Policy,
entitled, "Electric and Magnetic Fields from 60 Hertz Electric Power:  What do
we know about possible health risks?"  The booklet was mentioned in the July
issue of the IEEE Spectrum, and is for sale by CMU for $3.

The booklet also goes to great pains never to use the word "radiation" in
connection with electric power lines, except to say that it's not like X-rays
or other forms of "ionizing radiation" (quotes in the original).  It also tries
to discount epidemiological data that establishes a correlation between ELF
radiation and cancers and birth defects, by saying that just because a rooster
crows in the morning when the temperature is rising doesn't mean that the
rooster CAUSED the temperature to rise.

There seems to be a concerted effort on the part of the Dept. of Engineering
and Public Policy at CMU to lobby the public that there's nothing to get
excited about here, that scientists don't all agree on the interpretation of
the data and that therefore we should follow a "prudent" course (they use that
word a lot), by which they mean no government regulation at all, just maybe you
should put your electric blanket back on the shelf in the closet.

To understand why an academic institution would go to such lengths to try to
dampen public interest in the health risks of ELF radiation, I had to read the
fine print in the front of the booklet, where I discovered that the research
was supported, and the production costs of the booklet paid for, by the
Electric Power Research Institute, a lobbying arm of the electric power
industry in this country.

Quoted, from the 18th July editon of the London "Daily Telegraph".

            Customs 'lose' 35.6 million wine bottles

Customs officials admitted yesterday that their computers had "lost" 35,600,000
bottles of wine, destroying the reliability of figures on how much wine Britons
are drinking.  "We never dreamed the error by Customs could be so enormous,"
said Mr.  Alastair Eadie, chairman of the Wine and Spirit Association, which
queried returns dating back to the start of last year.

It emerges that the computers developed such a liking for wine that they kept
millions of bottles to themselves. Figures were entered correctly, but not
released when needed to compile statistics.  All wines, apart from small
quantities made at home by enthusiasts as a hobby, have to go into bonded
warehouses so duty can be charged on them before they are sold. That is why
records are kept on computer by the tax collectors.

At the start of last year, Customs and Excise updated its computer methods and
something went wrong. "All the information went in but not all of it came out
again," it was stated.  It did not mean that vast quantities of wine escaped
duty. That was correctly paid whenever supplies were drawn from bond. It meant
sales were grossly understated when official returns were issued at the end of
each month.  The trade relies on these figures for a nationwide picture of how
sales are going.

Wine merchants became suspicious as official figures showed sales declining
when shop returns suggested otherwise. And the monthly statistics started to
suffer delays, being issued later and later.  "What's gone wrong?" the
Association asked. Now they have the answer.

The correction means that wine drinking in Britain rose by more than 3% instead
of declining 1% as originally reported by Customs.  "This is splendid news,"
said Mr. Eadie. "And the provisional data for the first quarter of 1989 shows a
rise of nearly 5 and-a-half percent compared with the first quarter of last
year."  Sales of sparkling wines, which includes champagne, alone increased by
22% "Three months is scarcely enough to suggest a trend for 1989 as a whole but
they make a fine start." Mr. Eadie said. "Wine trade prospects have definitely
brightened considerably."

Confessed computer hacker Kevin Mitnick was sentenced Tuesday to 1 year in
prison, followed by three years of "supervised release," the first six months
of which will be spent in a residential psychological counseling program,
according to an article by Henry Weinstein in the ' Los Angeles Times' 19 July
1989.  The 7.5 months Mitnick has spent in custody while charges were pending
against him will be credited against his one-year prison sentence.

Prosecutor Asst. U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger said, " We think it's a very
fair sentence.  The sentence shows computer hacking is serious business that
can result in jail time."

&gt;	o Enhanced deterrence through the ability to hit mobile targets.

Unless the Soviets have developed mobile cities this is not deterrence.  This
is "counterforce".  This is "first strike".  One of the RISKS of developing
such technology is that in a potential East-West conflict situation the
opposing forces might implement a "use them or lose them" strategy with respect
to their delivery vehicles (as they would say in the DoD).

There is a RISK in *BECOMING DEPENDENT* on technology, instead of 
merely using it for efficiency and convenience.  (Imagine not having 
ATMs anymore and having to run to the bank before it closes.)

From RISKS-DIGEST 9.4:
&gt; Unspecified hardware problems caused 104 brief failures in a new ...
&gt; An emergency technical crew was FLOWN IN [emphasis mine] from  New Jersey 
&gt; and worked all night Monday to correct the problem.  

Wouldn't it have been funny if we REALLY NEEDED the TRACON working in order to
fly in to California?  Then the emergency crew might have had to take AMTRAK...

I will have very limited time and net access for the next 3.5 weeks (but only a
day or two of vacation).  If this is a period when mishaps and disasters cry
out for RISKS discussions, send in your contributions anyway and I'll get to
them whenever possible.  PGN

From the "Rumor Roundup" column in DIGITAL REVIEW (trade newspaper that tracks
DEC doings) of 17 July 1989:

    My DEC friends tell me that DEC employees now have a special way
    of traveling back in time.  It seems that a memo on the internal
    electronic bulletin board goes on at great length about how to
    take advantage of a loophole in the rules governing domestic
    discount airfares.  By booking the return flight as the departing
    flight, and the departing flight as the return flight, the airline
    computer system thinks the traveler is staying over the weekend. 
    Apparently, the reservations program does not understand that
    people have to leave before they can return.

A security hole has been found in SunOS restore.  This problem affects
SunOS 4.0, 4.0.1, and 4.0.3 systems.  It does not appear in SunOS 3.5.
The problem occurs because restore is setuid to root.  Without going
into details, is sufficient to say that this is a serious hole.  All
SunOS 4.0 installations should install this workaround.  Note that a
user does need to have an existing account to exploit this hole.

There are two workarounds that will fix the problem.  The first is
slightly more secure but has some side-effects.  

1) Make restore non-setuid by becoming root and doing a 
chmod 750 /usr/etc/restore

This makes restore non-setuid and unreadable and unexecutable by
ordinary users.

Making restore non-setuid affects the restore command using a remote
tape drive.  You will no longer be able to run a restore from another
machine as an ordinary user; instead, you'll have be root to do so.
(The reason for this is that the remote tape drive daemon on the
machine with the tape drive expects a request on a TCP privileged
port.  Under SunOS, you can't get a privileged port unless you are
root.  By making restore non-setuid, when you run restore and request
a remote tape drive, restore won't be able to get a privileged port,
so the remote tape drive daemon won't talk to it.)

2) If you do need to have some users run restore from remote tape
drives without being root, you can use the following workaround.

cd /usr/etc
chgrp operator restore
chmod 4550 restore

This allows the use of restore by some trusted group.  In this case,
we used the group 'operator', but you may substitute any other group
that you trust with access to the tape drive.  Thus, restore is still
setuid and vulnerable, but only to the people in the trusted group.

The 4550 makes restore readable and executable by the group you
specified, and unreadable by everyone else.

Sun knows about this problem (Sun Bug 1019265) and will put in a more
permanent fix in a future release of SunOS.

[From the Seattle Weekly, 5/3/89]

PUT A CONDOM ON YOUR COMPUTER

Every worry that your computer might be hanging out in a network where it
will pick up some disgusting virus?  Empirical Research Systems of Tacoma
suggests you supply it with one of their "computer condoms".  This high-tech
prophylactic is a combination of hardware and software embodied in a
controller card that simply replaces the one already in the machine.  Rick
Cummings, the company's president, says the system "stops all viruses" by
monitoring the user network, the keyboard, and the program in use.  He notes
that the system is programmable to alter the parameters of its control on
any given machine, but he guarantees that, "when programmed to your
requirements, it will not allow viruses to enter."

The technology was developed through successful efforts to protect a group of
European banks from the massive virus that penetrated European computer
networks last autumn.  "Naturally these became our first orders," Cummings
says.  He has since picked up an additional 2500 firm orders in Europe, with
5000 more contingent on inspection of the product.  In the United States, the
product has been reviewed by Boeing Computer Services and computer technicians
at the UW.  It will be on the domestic market "early next autumn at a cost of
under $1000," Cummings says.

The 7/27/89 Boston Herald reports that Robert T. Morris has been indicted on
a single felony count of accessing without authorization at least six (!!)
university and military computers.  He therefore becomes the first person to
be charged under the "Computer Fraud and Abuse act of 1986", a dubious honor
at best. If convicted he faces a possible prison sentence of 5 years and a
possible $250,000 fine.

You precisely underline the risk involved - that the software engineers
working on life-critical might not be trained in "modern software
engineering".

One does not have to be an academic computer scientist to understand
recursion, dynamic memory allocation, multi-tasking, and interrupts.
One does not have to be an academic computer scientist to use them, or
to decide not to use them.

However, decisions to use or not use such techniques must be informed,
and made from knowledge, not ignorance. Turning one's back on new
techniques because they are risky in the hands of untrained people is
not the answer - training them in the new techniques is.

Yes, training people in software engineering is an expensive business
- it also takes time, and is an ongoing process. But if someone
involved in RISKy projects is not a top-flight software engineer,
isn't that a serious risk to the project? And to the lives that may
depend on it?

The terms software engineering and software engineer have clearly gotten
completely out of control if people with AA degrees or less are calling
themselves software engineers.  It is my understanding that the ABET takes
a very strong stand on who should be allowed to call themselves an engineer.
If I remember correctly, they say that the term should only be applied to
those who have one of the following qualifications:

  1) People who have passed a state professional engineering examination.

  2) People who have graduated from an accredited 4-year engineering program.

  3) People who have graduate degrees.

In the past, I have had a fairly negative feeling towards this strict rule.
As a professor of computer science in the liberal arts college of a large
university, I've always had the feeling that it discriminated against graduates
of my program in favor of graduates of similar programs that happen (usually
for historical reasons) to be in engineering colleges.

I feel strongly enough about the misapplication of the term software engineer
that, if things continue to develop the way they are currently developing, I
would even be willing to urge state regulation of the use of the designation.

Consider an analogy:  The people who design the power distribution system for
a power plant are electrical engineers.  They have college degrees in
electrical engineering, they are usually fairly senior, and they usually have
state professional engineering certificates.  The people who build the power
distribution system are electricians working under the supervision of an
electrical engineer.  They may have AA degrees in engineering technology, and
they have passed a state or local electricians examination.

I do not object to someone with an AA degree in software technology helping to
write the software to control that power plant, but I do object to their
billing themselves as a software engineer, and I do object if the power company
puts them in charge of the design of such software.  This appears to be
precisely what is happening today.

I have enjoyed the recent arguments about polling and interrupts that were
kindled by the UK defense software standards debate, but I have found them to
be incomplete.

I have written real-time software, I have worked on the design of real-time
multiprocessors, and this summer, I have even spent far too many hours counting
cycles, but I also like interrupts.

When I was involved with the Modcomp User's Group, and again, when I worked for
Rockwell International, I met many strong advocates of the view taken by the UK
software standards.  Most of them were older programmers who hadn't heard of
Dijkstra but had years of experience making reasonably complex real-time
systems work reasonably well.

Their arguments usually boiled down to the following:  When a program is
constructed as a single main polling loop and all action routines are called
from within this loop, it is easy to assure that the program meets real-time
constraints.  Each routine called from within the main loop can be given a
strict time limit, and it is fairly simple to show that each routine lives
within this limit.

Within action routines called from the main polling loop, some fairly simple
rules must, of course, be obeyed.  Straight-line code is easy to verify,
branching code is easy to verify, and definite loops can be verified, but
indefinite loops are forbidden.

If you look at typical real-time programs of the 60's and 70's, these rules
weren't much trouble.  User interfaces were crude at best, and most of the
processing was fairly simple feedback control with little algorithmic
complexity.  Unfortunately, many of the larger problems we face today are far
more complex, with significant algorithmic components.

The very coding constraints that allow straightforward verification that a
a program meets simple real-time constraints serve to obscure the algorithmic
structure of the program.  When one or more logical tasks within a real-time
program involve complex algorithmic structures, they must usually be recoded
using state machines that make a state transition each time they are called
from the main polling loop.

As a result, it remains easy to verify that the complex tasks do not consume
more than their allotted time slots in the main polling cycle, but that is
all.  All other aspects of the complex tasks are hidden in a mass of state
machines so that even simple questions can take hours to answer.  In fact,
this structure can even impede the verification that some real-time
constraints are met.  Consider the problem of verifying the real time
behavior of a logical task that, after detecting an event, must respond
after a computation that requires multiple iterations of the main loop.

The Boston Globe today (Fri, July 21) reported that the GAA has recommended
that an advisory committee be set up to run the Internet since there was "no
one as the wheel" in the latest virus incident.  It seems to me that this
potentially slows down the response time of the Internet to such problems
and creates a single point of failure (cut out communication to the
committee and now no one knows what to do).

Two points:

1. Many years ago, the single integrated target list was for a war,
 that included by implication nuclear war.  But even in nuclear war,
 NOT EVERY weapon used will be nuclear.  There are some missions 
 where conventional albeit "smart" weapons would really be better.
 It follows that we - and they - really do need to target things
 that move; e.g., large ships, and mobile missile launchers.

2. A large ship is almost equivalent in population and technical
 complexity to a small town; e.g., 5000 "residents" with enough
 "restaurants" and "movie theaters" to serve them.
 Recent news item: The USSR is developing for deployment its
 first aircraft carrier.

The technical points of "how to select" targets are a fertile question for
RISKS.  If and when we want to debate the policy, maybe we should move that
to ARMS-D@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU

Two amusing computer-related security stories from the Univ. of Colorado:

1.  Bank Card Numbers for Everyone:  Continuing Education offers community
courses and unlike other units of the university is therefore compelled to
accept bank cards for payment.  This necessity was overlooked when the new
student information system was created so no protected field was allocated to
hold bank card numbers and no otherwise unused field appeared to be big enough. 
But someone cleverly decided to use an unused address field for this purpose
until it was discovered that almost anyone with any access to the system could
then read a student's name, address, and VISA number.

2.  Another Two-Word Last Name Problem:  The Colorado Association of
Research Libraries now offers an on-line database of citations for every
article in every journal any of the libraries receive.  It isn't as good
as services offered by DIALOG or ISI or other big commercial operations
but it is a boon to local researchers.  They offer it free to university
folks but want to sell the service to outside users.  Hence, all faculty
now need user ids.  They cleverly use SSN and last name and both are
displayed when you type them on a public terminal.  But mine wouldn't
work!  I called the CARL office and once I identified myself as a
confused faculty member the cheerful clerk gladly told me my proper user
id over the phone.  [I thought about asking her how she knew I was who I
said I was but the risks seem to be all theirs and not mine so I didn't
bother.]  It turns out one must add the prefix "A9/" to the SSN [maybe
they added that for security :-)].  But mine still wouldn't work.  Then
she discovered that on the university payroll tape that had been used to
create the user database my name had been entered as "Mc Clelland" so
that forevermore my CARL name would be "Mc".  That worked fine.

Excerpted from "The Facts About ... Credit Cards," in the April 1989
issue of "Vis a Vis" magazine, "The Magazine of United Airlines, Inc.":

     "Enhancement" is industry parlance for the tie-ins, upgrades,
     rewards, automatic insurance and warranty protection for products
     bought with the card.  Issuers continuously sweeten the
     enticements ...

     Shopping for clothes?  Traveling abroad?  Do you prefer bespoke
     British tailoring?  Country inns -- in New England or France?
     Your card company will soon know a thing or two about your tastes
     in restaurants and may some day [sic] be a source of
     recommendations for lodging, dining and a host of other services.

     Card companies are investing huge sums of money to read and
     analyze your charge receipts.  The "enhancement wars" create handy
     perks, but the battle for the hearts and minds of cardholders also
     rages in computer banks across the country ...

     The payoff for issuers who successfully use technology to analyze
     customer spending will be tremendous, asserts John Love of "Credit
     Card News."  "This information is extremely personal to the
     customer," he says.  "He might begin to feel that his card company
     really understands him."

     Chenault of American Express says his company is "betting the
     ranch" on its $100 million Genesis Project.  The program's goal is
     to make sure the company's nearly 300 mainframes and minicomputers
     can create dossiers on the tastes of cardholders.  Says Chenault:
     "If a cardmembers is traveling to Paris, we could develop a
     personalized itinerary before he even gets there.  We'll know his
     tastes in restaurants, special interests and shopping, and we
     could work with establishments to arrange even big-ticket
     purchases."

Sigh.

	"Video and graphics processing is performed, and digitized
	pictures are relayed to the helmet display."

It's the graphics processing that offers the most promise.  Some
projects (sorry, I have no references) are investigating the effect on
military pilot performance when the visual display is *simplified*, to
the point where important objects in the field of view are reduced to
wireframe figures, and unimportant objects are eliminated altogether.
Thus, an approaching mountain might look like an inverted cone sticking
up ahead of you; a river underneath (or civilians about to be bombed)
wouldn't be visible at all; and aircraft around you would show as stick
figures, perhaps with color coding to convey relative velocity,
friend-or-foe evaluation, etc.  An approaching missile might look like
a line growing toward you, just like it does in the "missile attack"
video games.

The win is that humans are better at pattern recognition when the
patterns are simple and the distractions are eliminated, especially in
time-critical situations.  Look at how well we do at those video games.

Another win is that, since the pilot no longer needs visual input
besides the (relatively low-bandwidth) wireframe presentation, it
becomes that much easier to move the pilot outside the plane, perhaps
to a bunker on the ground, and run the plane by remote control.  The
only important sensory input that would be missing is acceleration
(including gravity, "which way is down"), and good pilots learn to
distrust that anyway.

But there are still occasions when you need a full-video picture, such
as evaluating damage to an enemy aircraft (is it on fire?) or locating
an emergency landing site.  And simplified video presents new
opportunities for defensive counter-measures -- you'd like the enemy's
system to classify your fighter as "unimportant," or to classify your
chass as "important."

	"... the possibility of crashing an airplane because of a
	failure in the video system, coupled with the inability to look
	out the window (because the plane doesn't have one) is
	terrifying."

This risk should be kept in perspective.  For example, on a high
performance aircraft with forward-swept wings, if the computer handling
flight stability goes down, it doesn't much matter whether the pilot
can see or not; the plane is going to crash.

Edited excerpts from an article by William Trombley in the 'Los Angeles
Times' 14-Aug-89:

A new law which takes effect Jan. 1, 1990, requires California counties to
place the source code of their vote-counting computer programs in escrow so
they can be checked by independent experts in case of disputed results.
The law is a partial response to increasing criticism that electronic vote
tabulation sometimes is inaccurate and is vulnerable to tampering because
of lax security.

The California secretary of state will approve escrow facilities and will
determine what material should be placed in escrow and under what
circumstances the source codes should be made accessible to investigators.
The escrow plan also allows election officials access to the codes should
the companies that produce the software go out of business or stop selling
that particular product, as has happened in several states.

California's new law coincides with efforts by the National Clearinghouse
for Election Administration, an arm of the Federal Election Commission, to
produce voluntary state standards for computerized elections.  The federal
standards, published in the Federal Register last week, also call for
putting source codes in escrow.  So far, Texas, New York and a few other
states have laws similar to California's.

Reactions to the new law vary:

Tom Diebold, president of DFM Associates, one election system vendor: "The
problem with escrow is that it makes it easier for someone who wants to
manipulate an election to get their hands on the source code."

Lester Jaspovice, V.P. and corporate counsel for Sequoia Pacific Systems,
another vendor:  "My company doesn't like it, but, as an attorney, I think
it's a good idea.  It provides a virgin copy of the code that the court can
call on in case of a dispute."

Howard Strauss, Princeton University computer scientist and member of
Election Watch:  If the source code in escrow differs from the one used to
count votes, "then you know something's wrong.  But if they're the same, it
doesn't tell you anything because they could both contain the same
mistakes."  Strauss also doubted that the law would protect against a
company going out of business or losing its top scientific talent.  "The
idea is that these escrow facilities will have technical people who can
read this stuff, but some of it is so badly written that, even after months
of work, you wouldn't know what it was all about."

Crew Deer, V.P. of Data Securities International, a computer software
escrow company:  "If the code has a bug in it, it will show up on both the
original and the copy, but that's good because you at least know it's a
technical problem and nobody has been tampering."  According to Deer, the
escrow fees for vote-counting source code might be about $1500 plus
$1000/year after that.  If a result is challenged and a detailed
verification process is carried out, the cost could be as much as $30,000.

Several critics said the new law does nothing to correct what they consider
to be the major flaw in computerized elections -- the presence of poorly
trained, underpaid election workers who do not understand the computerized
equipment they are using to count votes.

  [For the record, on July 2, 3, and 4, the 'Los Angeles Times' ran a very
  lengthy series by William Trombley on computers and vote counting.  Nothing
  new, but a fair summary of past troubles, present systems, and suggested
  changes.

  It includes quotes from many election officials, computer scientists, and
  statisticians.  Among those cited are RISKS contributors Gary Chapman and
  Marc Rotenberg of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, Lance
  Hoffman of George Washington University, Willis Ware of RAND, and RISKS
  moderator Peter Neumann.  (See RISKS 7.52 and 7.70 for references to past
  reports on the subject.)]

More than 6000 voters were unable to vote in local government
elections in Victoria on Saturday, August 5th, because of a 
computer error made by the Australian Electoral Commission.
Newly enrolled voters and those who had changed municipalities had
their names left of the updated electoral rolls.

The error was made five months ago, but was detected less than
24 hours before the opening of the polling booths. A full internal
inquiry has been ordered into why the error was detected so late, as
well as its original cause.

Legal opinion indicate the elections are not invalidated by the error,
although legal challenges are expected from narrowly losing candidates.
One bitter voter affected by the error noted that voting in the 
elections was compulsory - a bitter irony for those left of the rolls.

My answering machine is one that allows me to call in from a push-button
phone and signal it to play back my messages with a 2-digit code.  In
addition, there are single-digit codes that reset the machine, go forwards,
backwards, change the outgoing message, etc.

I just called in to get my messages; there was one.  Just before the caller
hung up they accidentally bumped some keys on their phone, resulting in
some digit tones being recorded on their message.  I heard this and
waited for the machine to beep to tell me it had finished playback.  Instead,
it played the message again... and again...  Apparently it was taking
input from the message tape as valid, and one of the buttons the caller
pressed was the "backwards" command.

I suppose if I were getting the message off the machine at home this
wouldn't happen, because it would not be in remote mode.  This has some
interesting consequences for the unscrupulous callers and unwary callees.

              "The New Homes Are Getting Smarter"
            "Cued by computers, they run themselves"
                        by Mark McCain
(Excerpted from the Real Estate Section of the New York Times, August 13, 1989)

    Although electronic brains these days control televisions and telephones,
offices and automobiles, the average house is still a mindless creature,
bumbling along without any effort to make itself more safe [!!!], or
economical, comfortable or convenient.

    For many houseowners, that's fine.  The thought of a house smart enough
to take matters into its own hands is absurd - even threatening.  Who's
to say it wouldn't fire up the oven after midnight just on a lark?

    But new houses are improving their IQs.  After many years of futuristic
talk without much follow-through, builders are beginning to install automated
systems that act like all-knowing butlers.  Not surprisingly, the systems
are most popular in expensive houses, where budgets are big and rooms so
numerous that even turning off lights at bedtime can be burdensome. [...]

    "When my 3-year-old boy comes out of his room at night, a motion detector
turns on the hallway light for him," says Robert Pomeranz, a banking executive
who lives in a new 7,500-square-foot house outside Washington.  "Obviously,
it's not worth buying an integrated control system for small things like
that, but it's amazing how useful the system can be as you become comfortable
with it."

    Like humans, the systems aren't perfect.  A light may turn on for no 
apparent reason or a front door may refuse to open for it's master.

    [That sounds nice in an emergency...]

    "The houses we're building today have interiors right out of the space
age, even though their exterior appearances are traditional," said Kenneth
Nadler, an architect in Mount Kisco, NY, who designs expensive houses. 
"It's Jetson on the inside and Gatsby on the outside."

    For a homeowner eager to outdo even George Jetson, the futuristic TV cartoon
character, there's a $26,000 whirlpool that accepts calls - say, from a
car phone - to start water running at bath-perfect temperature.  Too expensive?
For less than $1,500, there's a fireplace with a gas flame adjustable from
glowing to roaring by infrared remote control.

    [Could Audi 5000's order up a bath by themselves? :-) ]

    But even aficionados have their limits.

    "I'm afraid of those things," said Joel Sommer, a Maryland builder who
infuses his multi-million-dollar houses with high technology.  "What whould
happen if the whirlpool didn't shut off automatically or gas started flowing
in the fireplace without an ignition spark?  I just don't see the benefit
of some products."

    Certainly, automated devices built into houses today do not always make
practical sense.  It is a situation reminiscent of the home-computer craze
in the early 1980's, when companies promoted computers for such uses as
storing recipes, even though ingredients that only soil a cookbook page
might easily destroy a kitchen keyboard.  Today home computers are common,
but not for recipes or checkbook balancing or other uses suggested by early
promoters.

    "In similar fashion, I'm sure we'll find a great many applications for
home automation that people haven't thought of yet or haven't predicted
to be big winners," said Roger Dooley, editor of Electronic Home, a trade
magazine published in Mishawka, Ind.  "And what's being touted today as
big benefits may end up being used by only a few homeowners." [...]

    "I live alone in a 10,000-square-foot house with only my housekeeper,
so I need to feel really secure, and what I've installed is state-of-the-art,"
said [... someone who has such a system.  She also ...] has a sensor in each
room to control the temperature, and only once have things gone awry.  "During
a storm with heavy lightning the sensor in the living room got stuck at 95
degrees," she said.  "So the air-conditioning system kept trying to cool the
room. It felt like a meat locker." [...] 

    Beyond that, there's the gee-whiz appeal, like a synthesized voice in the
kitchen that anounces when a letter carrier has delivered the mail. [...]  "You
don't have to install an integrated control system," said Mr. Sommer, the
developer, who is completing an 11,000-square-foot house with such a system. "I
happen to enjoy them because my background is in computer science.  But really,
they're toys." 

    [discussion of business aspects of marketing these systems...] 

    One futuristic idea now becoming more practical is voice control.  Already,
voice-recognition devices that allow a computer to understand a vocabulary of
about 75 words are available for less than $500.  As those devices become more
powerful and less expensive, they will be an option for controlling home
automation. 

    "You'll be able to just walk up and talk to it," explained David MacFadyen,
an industry expert.  "When you say, 'Good night, house,' the temperature
controls will be set back in unoccupied areas, the hot-water heater will be set
back, the phone will go on voice-mail.  Just a couple of words will trigger an
evening shutdown sequence that is far more elaborate than anything we can think
of now.

A documentary on UK's Channel 4, 13 Aug 1989, was about traffic
problems, especially congestion in cities.

After concluding that there was no obvious and fair solution, the 
programme suggested that the best hope lay in more automation in
cars.  What's more, the programme implied that machines driving cars
would be feasible in the medium term (next decade or two).

For instance, shots were shown of a human driven automobile in
which experimenters were recording data about close vehicles, etc.
Apparently, and I paraphrase the commentator, although the 
researchers were only recording data, there's no reason in principle
why the information should not be fed into control computers.
The clear implication was that this would be much safer than letting
humans drive.

Also, with automatically or semi-automatically driven, it would be 
possible for my vehicle to refuse to let me drive into a city centre
if the centre was too busy.

The risks are obvious and horrific, but what is even more depressing
is that experts in other fields just do not see the risks, and that
TV researchers do not even think to ask anybody who might know about
these risks.

Quoted from The Dominion, Monday August 14 :

A computer virus call marijuana has wreaked havoc in the Australian
Defence Department and New Zealand is getting the blame.

Data in a sensitive security area in Canberra was destroyed and when
officers tried to use their terminals a message appeared : "Your PC is
stoned - Legalise marijuana".

Viruses are [guff on viruses] The New Zealand spawned marijunana has
managed to spread itself widely throughout the region.

Its presence in Australia has been known for the past two months. The
problem was highlighted two weeks ago when a Mellbourne man was
charged with computer trespass and attempted criminal damage for
allegedly loading it into a computer at the Swinbourne Institute of
Technology.

The virus invaded the Defence Department earlier this month - hitting
a security division repsonsible for the prevention of computer viruses.

A director in the information systems division, Geoff Walker said an
investigation was under way and the infection was possibly an
embarrassing accident arising from virus prevention activities.

New personal computers installed in the section gobbled data from
their hard disk, then disabled them.

Initially it was believed the virus was intoduced by a subcontractor
installing the new computer system but that possibility has been ruled out.

One more outlandish theory suggested New Zealnd, piqued at its
exclusion from Kangaroo 89 military exercises under way in northern
Australia, was showing its ability to infiltrate the Canberra citadel.

New Zealand was not invited to take part in Kangaroo because of United
States' policy of not taking part in exercises with New Zealand forces
since Labour's antinuclear legislation. However, New Zealand observers
were invited.

New Zealand Defence Department spokesmand Lieutenant Colonel Peter Fry
categorically denied the claim. "It would be totally irresponsible to
do this kind of thing."

In fact, New Zealand's Defence Department already had problems with
the virus, he said.

  If most large-system sites have user-installed trapdoors...

  If techies and technical management install these trapdoors to evade
the access control tables because they are convinced these subsystems
are 1) too often mismanaged, 2) too easily corrupted, 3) too cumbersome
in an emergency, or 4) too prone to technical failure...

  Then -- so long as this huge community of unbelievers remains
unwilling to submit to the control of the access control system -- we
_will_ have users installing trapdoors for an alternative path to
high-priviledged status, despite the obvious risks.

  If 15 years of unrelenting propaganda by the vendors and gurus have
left the users so unwilling to follow the prescribed path of
righteousness, maybe someone other than the users should reconsider.  As
it is, user-installed trapdoors are almost universal on big systems, but
because they are illicit, "secret," they are seldom protected by
anything more than their obscurity.

  What is so wrong about giving the users a safe model for what they
demand -- a route around the access control system -- when just they
take it anyway, security be damned?

  Who is being more unrealistic:  the system programmers who code these
traps, or the security specialists who ignore the fact that virtually
all systems have trapdoors?  Aren't we talking about trusting people who
are already virtually all-powerful in their environment?

  Why can't we use an alternative security device to secure this
alternative access path?  Encryption seems a likely padlock.  With a mix
of synch and asynch crypto, it seems possible to set up a "one-time key"
access, supported by user authentication, separation of function, audit
trails.  Heck, add an audible alarm.  Even without the PKE frills,
simple encryption can put a lock on what is otherwise an open gate
hidden in the thickets.  Continuing the masquerade, ignoring the
existence of the problem, gets us Nowhere.

  For twenty years people have been showing me trapdoors into systems.
Now, I'm shown or told of trapdoors that open whole networks (recently,
one which popped a net of control systems for a major phone company,
installed by management.)  Now, I chat with hackers who give tutorials
on how to locate user-installed trapdoors.  One "specialist" recently
told me that it seldom takes him more than 20 minutes to identify such a
trapdoor in a typical corporate MVS system.

  The auditors are not the only ones, nor likely the most challenging
foe, these users have to outsmart.

From wire service stories in the 'Los Angeles Times' August 3 and 4, 1989:

Computer problems frustrated a record opening-day crowd at New York's Saratoga
Race Track on Wednesday, and track officials said Thursday's card might be
canceled if the problem was not fixed by Thursday morning.  Bettors were kept
in the dark about the odds, payoffs, and even the time of day.

"There's some sort of gremlin running around that software, and we can't find
it," said Gerard McKeon, president of the New York Racing Assn on Wednesday.
... The computer problem extended Wendesday's nine-race card by an hour and
cost NYRA about $1.5 million in handle, McKeon said.  Pari-mutuel machines and
the track's tote boards were also affected by the problem.

Technicians worked through the night to replace the software, and things
were apparently back to normal on Thursday.

Here's a first-hand account of an item for RISKS, since I was there on
Wednesday.

August 3, 1989,  Latham, NY

Yesterday was opening day for thoroughbred racing at the Saratoga Race
Course in Saratoga Springs, New York.

It was a computer disaster.

The beginning of the 122nd season was ruined by computer problems which
forestalled the placement of wagers for Races 5 through 9 of the 9-race
program.  The New York Racing Association, which operates Saratoga and
the other racing facilities in New York, is estimating a loss of $1.5
million in on-track, and $2 million in off-track handle.  The loss in
good will is not measurable--parimutuel systems are dependent on their
accuracy and reliability for continued patronage--chances are most fans
will be forgiving and come back.  Provided, that is, that the system
gets straightened out.

This is by no means certain.  Racing officials announced yesterday that
they had no idea what had caused the computer system to crash, and for
fans to listen for a 9 AM announcement this morning before heading for
the track.  This morning, NYRA announced that they intend to offer
wagering today, that they believe they have found the software problem
and corrected it, and that they are "80%" sure the system will work
correctly once betting begins today.

Like most tracks, betting information is displayed both on Tote Boards
(light-bulb displays) and on computer-generated video screens.  Both
types of displays were affected by the problem(s)--at one point, I
observed that odds displayed on the two types differed.  (Presumably
one was being updated from the computer, and the other not. However,
regardless of which was correct, some fans were being provided with
inaccurate information.)

Though the displays worked on and off from the 5th race on, the betting
machines did not function at all.  The machines are of two
types--terminals which are located at the regular betting windows, and
which are operated by track employees; and so-called "SAMs", which
employ touchie-feelie screens so that bettors can place their own
wagers.  The self-service machines allow a bettor to insert a
winning ticket or a cash voucher.  Under ordinary circumstances, the
value of the ticket or voucher is read and then displayed on the
screen.  At the beginning of the computer outage, machines were
displaying incorrect values for tickets, or simply eating tickets or
vouchers.  Bettors who had encountered problems at the betting windows
at least had a human clerk to complain to--those using the SAMs had to
stand around wondering what to do.

Post times for races were delayed in hopes that the computers could be
made to operate, but to no avail.  The final race took place nearly an
hour later than usual--and only those few who had made advance wagers
early in the day had any money riding.

Because the system handles both bets and payoffs, automated calculation of
prices for winning horses was also pretty much incapacitated.  People holding
winning tickets (even from previous races) were not able to cash them.

Technicians worked overnight, having flown up from Autotote in
Delaware, and apparently fixed some software problems, but officials
still are not certain of what happened exactly.

Today, Thursday, the system seemed to operate properly.  The normal $2
admission fee was waived, as a gesture to yesterday's disappointed
fans.  However, given that officials were uncertain this morning that
it would hold up, the system's performance may have been more luck than
anything else.

Other than having diagnosed the problem as a software, rather than a hardware,
one, officials are offering no explanation as to what the problem was.
However, as an outsider, one could focus on the following factors:

     When the season at Saratoga starts each year, most of the equipment
     used  is moved up from Belmont Park, near New York City.  The move,
     which includes starting gates, etc.,  as  well  as  the  computers,
     betting machines, and TV monitors, takes place in the timespan from
     the last race at Belmont on Monday to the first race at Saratoga on
     Wednesday.   Assuming  that no hardware damage occurred in transit,
     this allows very little time for testing, since some of those 30-40
     hours are taken up by travel time and installation.

     Though  officials  say  that software changes are made nearly every
     week, a number of changes--some in effect  only  for  the  Saratoga
     meet--were  made in the betting rules.  For example, Triple betting
     is now offered in the 8th as well as the 9th race;  the  number  of
     horses  required  to  be  entered  in races offering certain exotic
     wagers was lowered; and for two racing days  only,  when  important
     stakes  races  are  run,  exacta  wagering  will be allowed for all
     races, regardless of the number of horses entered.

My guess is that more--and more sophisticated--software changes were made than
normally, and that, with limited time to test a system which was asked to
handle wagers from 30,000 people yesterday, some bug went undetected until
triggered yesterday.

It will be interesting to find out what backup setup NYRA utilizes.
Officials mentioned today that, if the system broke down today, that
hopefully their backup systems would not fail, so that they could
determine what went wrong.  This leads me to believe that there was a
secondary failure of some type yesterday, such that the planned backup
process did not work.

During the present slow-down in RISKS, I was particularly happy when, this
evening, my netnews reader presented me with an `unread' RISKS digest.  It
was not until I was half way through it that I realized it was one I had
already seen.  In fact it was RISKS 8.81 from 17 June 1989.  Was this a
local phenomenon, or has the Network, not wishing to RISK lower ratings,
started airing Summer Reruns?

Just curious,

This isn't a computer incident, but it contains several system safety lessons
that may be of interest to readers of this digest.  The accident has been
discussed in the Seattle papers almost every day since December 22.  The
following excerpts are from one of the stories that describe the cause, in 
THE SEATTLE TIMES, Monday January 8, 1990, p. 1:

TWO SHORTED WIRES JOINED TO CAUSE FATAL ACCIDENT, INSPECTORS SAY by Dick Lilly

... Engineers found that a screw driven into one wire and a short in another
wire caused last month's fatal opening of the (Evergreen Point Floating
Bridge's) drawspan.

(The inspectors will report) to the State Department of Transportation (DOT) on
Friday, said Richard Hearth, one of two engineers from the consulting firm
of Parsons, Brinkerhof, Quade and Douglas Inc. who inspected the faulty
Highway 520 bridge Saturday and yesterday.

The two shorted wires, one on the east drawspan and one on the west span,
combined to send current around safety systems and lift the west section of
the drawspan during a routine test December 22.

Several cars crashed into the unexpectedly rising bridge deck. ... One (driver)
was killed.  Five people were injured in the morning rush hour accident. ...

"Each fault individually did not cause the problem," said Patrick Buller, an
electrical engineer from the (Washington State) Patrol who took part in the
investigation.  "It took both problems simultaneously for the bridge to rise,"
he said.

Power from the burned cable on the east drawspan probably reached the west 
side either through the metal of the bridge deck or along the metal walls of
the submerged cables which connect the two movable spans with the control
tower, said Daryl Rush, bridge maintenance supervisor for the DOT.

Picking up that current, the short on the west side, where 3/8-inch sheet metal
screw holding an electrical box cover had pierced a wire, sent power to motors
that lifted the west span, Hearth said.

The routine tests during which the accident occurred had until Dec. 22 been run
almost weekly without incident for 18 years.

Ironically, it was a tiny heater designed to keep moisture from damaging
circuits in an electrical relay that burned plastic insulation from one of the
wires, causing the short circuit on the east span.  Such heaters protect many
of the bridge's electrical devices.

During a bridge opening, the device housing the burned wire senses the rotation
of a gear in order to tell operators how far the east draw span has retracted.

At Step 10 in the 18-step dry-run test that ws going on the day of the fatal
accident, the device received power.  Though the bridge does not open during 
any part of the test procedure, the shorted wire allowed power to reach motors 
on the west span. 

For the Evergreen Point Bridge to open, grated sections of the bridge deck
rise, allowing sections of the roadway to slide back for the passage of ships.
...

[ Here are further excerpts from THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER, January
8, 1990, p. 1, ELECTRICAL SHORTS LIFTED SPAN by Mike Merrit ]

One move tranportation officials made to ensure such an accident doesn't happen
again is to stop the "dry run" tests of the bridge's control systems.  Future
tests will be done only with the span closed to traffic. ...

Hearth declined to comment on whether the bridge should have been designed with
automatic mechanisms to prevent activation of its lift-deck motors unless the
span was closed to traffic.  "In hindsight, the question is a good one," (John)
Stevenson (assistant district administrator for DOT) said.  "But when the
design was being completed, it's hard to know what factors were taken into
account.  ... The span was built across Lake Washington in 1962.

... The west span short circuit, caused when a tiny screw touched wires inside
a metal box, had probably existed for some months or years.  The second short
circuit ... had probably occurred gradually over several months or a year ...
(a) heater apparently melted insulation from one of a bundle of wires. 
Sometime between tests run Dec. 15 and Dec. 22, when the malfunction occured,
enough insulation melted away to let the bare wire touch the metal cover plate. 

... "The wire (with the melted insulation) is in such a place that it's not
real visible," said Ernest Frye, who oversees inspections as the bridge's lead 
maintenance technician. ...  (the assembly containing the wire) is inspected 
annually ... the latest inspection was April 9, 1989.  But the damaged wire is
one of a bundle of wires under a metal cover plate that is not usually
removed in routine inspections.  

Charles Mayhan, state moveable bridge engineer, said he did not do a detailed
examination of the ... mechanism while inspecting the bridge earlier this
year.  "If I took the time to do all that, I wouldn't be able to do more than
one bridge a year," he said.

[ The consulting engineers will recommend installation of devices to warn
operators of short circuits ]  Devices to detect small short circuits weren't 
widely used when the bridge was designed in the 1950's ...

On Friday Jan 5, 1989, as I was returning from a day's skiing, the electrical
system of the bus I was riding in suddenly went dead. The driver was forced to
pull over on the side of the expressway. Subsequent investigation showed that
the cause of the problem was a loose connection of the power cable leading to
the starter. This cable can carry several hundred amperes of starting current;
power is actually delivered to the starter motor via a nearby relay controlled
by the ignition key. According to the driver, the cable came off a loose
connection at the starter and shorted the high side of the battery to the
bottom of the oil pan, burning a hole and spattering oil on the engine.
Luckily, no fire resulted.

The driver got out and walked back to an emergency phone placed at the side of
the highway. He returned, saying that instead of being connected to the police,
he had heard a recorded message saying the phone was "not in a designated
area", and giving another number to dial. But the phone had no dial on it!

A passing motorist was able to help the driver by relaying a message to the
police.  As a result, the bus company was notified, and sent another bus to get
us home.

Some further observations:
1) The headlights and AM/FM radio still worked after we pulled over, but not
   the rear flashers or rear lights. The driver put a flare behind the bus.
2) Installation of a two-way radio was planned for the following Monday. But
   I wonder if it could operate independently of the electrical system of
   the bus, in an emergency.
3) The extreme cold weather had ended, so that no-one felt cold.

The part that is computer system related is the part about the roadside phones
giving an "error message" that the user could not respond to. I am reminded of
the customer-operated touch-screen POS terminal reported in RISKS that gave a
software error message and asked the user (customer) to hit return on a
keyboard that presumably had only been present during testing.

I see this situation as a case of losing track of the system's behaviour as
seen by the user. If you can get connected to a recording, then why not the
police station? In a potentially life-threatening situation, no other system
response is acceptable, in my view. Remeber the Woody Allen film where an
attempt to call the 911 police number results in an "all lines busy" voice
recording, followed by a disconnect? This case was no joke. Nor did it seem to
have been a failure of an individual phone, which wouldn't be worth mentioning
in RISKS.

There's also the issue of the primary failure (electrical failure) resulting in
a failure of systems to prevent further damage (the flashers).

So, while this tale appears marginally related to computers, I feel the system
ergonomics and reliability design issues are very pertinent, and easy to
visualize in this case.

A couple of nights ago I was working away merrily on my Macintosh with two cats
plopped all over the table as usual. For some reason, while I was working in a
usually reliable program, the computer froze. Couldn't figure it out; all I was
doing was typing. While I was still thinking, the Mac suddenly unfroze, and the
icon for the CDROM drive popped up on the desktop. It takes more than minute
for this particular CDROM to come online, during which time the Macintosh is
busied out, thus the inexplicable delay.

Who had pushed in the CDROM? A cat. One of them woke briefly, stretched,
changed position, and in doing so shoved the disk into the drive. Since I am
quite used to cats stretching I didn't bother to watch him and had no idea he
needed the disk online. I was already cursing the software for crashing the
machine until the icon showed up.

Part of the blame for this confusion can be laid squarely on Apple.  Their own
Human Interface Guidelines specify that the pointer should be replaced with a
watch for a "lengthy operation" (Inside Macintosh p.I-37). They often follow
their own guidelines, but not in this case.

   [Another hidden side-effect of the Unix "cat" command?  If blank text had
   been inserted, you might have thought the system had gone tabby.  Part of
   the problem is the emphasis on just "human" interfaces.  But perhaps your
   cat now has a Macintush.  Therein lies a tail.  PGN]

&gt;One student's answer:  "Passwords have the advantage that it's easier to let

&gt;So much for that one-week unit on 'Individual Accountability'.

I hope you also spent some time talking about how formal mechanisms often
imperfectly capture the real nature of human organizations, and about the
negative effects on security when overly-rigid formal mechanisms lead to the
evolution of informal "bypass" mechanisms?  This is a perfect example.  Anyone
who has ever loaned someone else a key knows that there *are* real requirements
for such things, accountability problems notwithstanding, when the overhead of
"doing it right" is high.

In an editorial remark added to my recent RISKS contribution, our Moderator
writes:
	If you want individual accountability, you do not share passwords.
	The telephone system is intrinsically vulnerable to illicit use of
	credit cards.  If you wish to trust a friend, that may have low risk
	-- unless MANY people are involved; then you might like to have
	records that show who is actually using your resources....

This continues to miss the point I was making.

Consider the following two situations:

	1.  The system manager on my machine assigns a shared account to
            me and five other people (who, let us say for the sake of
	    argument, are my friends).

	2.  I let the same five friends know what my password is.

Are these equivalent?  The answer is absolutely not:  While the "observable
facts" may look the same - the same people have the same information - the
RESPONSIBILITIES are radically different.  In case 1, if one of the six people
with access to the account abuse it, I will be able to deny responsibility -
as will the five others.  This is "lack of individual responsibility".

However, in case 2, if one of the six of us abuses the account, it is clear
who bears the responsibility:  Me.  My five friends are acting as my agents,
and I can complain all I like that it was they who acted - in giving them my
password, I implicitly accepted the consequences of their actions.

Now, the problem is that those of us with an interest in security can easily
see ourselves in case 1 - and we've learned that case 1 represents bad, if
all too common, system management policy.  (How many times have heard of
systems in which each account costs money, so any number of users are assigned
to the same account to keep the accountants happy?)  However, we have much
more difficulty imagining ourselves in case 2, since WE certainly would never
let others know our password.

However it is exactly case 2 which we are discussing here!  As long as it is
understood that the "owner of record" of an account remains responsible for
it no matter who he allows to use it - just as the owner of a telephone must
pay the charges his friends run up on it - I can see no issue of "individual
accountability" here.

The law, and our common sense of ethics, has been dealing with lending in this
way for a long, long time.  Why should computer accounts be treated in any
different way?  Admittedly, it may be worthwhile to point out to people that
lending their accounts has a greater potential for abuse than lending their
shirts, or whatever - exactly because passwords as a means of identification
are freely reproducible.  People understand this; they are more willing to lend
a key than to "lend" the combination to a lock.

It has always seemed to me that there is no point in trying to prevent people
from `lending' their passwords to others -- they'll do it anyway.

A better administrative strategy might be to make it plain to people that they
will be held responsible for any act committed under their login, whether they
actually did it or not.

&gt;    [Yes, some people are concerned about computer security and others are not
&gt;    -- at least not until they've been burned.  But Reality and Sensibility
&gt;   are in this case two radically different things.  If you want individual
&gt;   accountability, you do not share passwords. ...

This is all true, but the amount of security you need depends on many things.
For example, an account you pay money for might be a different matter than
an account on a local BBS, which again is different from an account on a
friend's UNIX box. Work and school accounts are another matter.

I wouldn't casually hand out passwords here at work, but I might give someone
my compuserve password... and I'd change it later. I'd be even more likely
to give someone a password for a local BBS, and probably wouldn't bother to
change it.

Another variant is who you give the password to. You might be willing to swap
passwords to class accounts at school, or project accounts at work, but you
probably wouldn't hand out your CI$ password to your co-workers.

So, having the ability to lend access to a resource is valuable, and is not
always somehing to be feared. Security and convenience being opposed goals,
it's important to gauge the level of security to the value of the resource in
question.

TCI's cable-TV provider in Springfield, Missouri, was testing its planned
inclusion of the Playboy Channel (to begin in February), when the Cartoon
Network channel suddenly began airing the Playboy video along with the
regularly programmed Flintstones' audio.  The results were perhaps more
noticeable than they might have been, because bad weather had closed the
local schools and children were at home.  [Source: Associated Press item in
the *San Francisco Chronicle*, 17 Jan 1997, AS2.  Maybe the program was
something about Sharon kissing the Barney Stone?]

There seems to be something magnetically RISKS-attractive about the Playboy
Channel, which last summer appeared unscrambled in the Palo Alto area
because of a power-failure-induced chip failure (<A HREF="/Risks/18.50.html">RISKS-18.50</A>).  A PC program
[a nicely overloaded acronym, since the program was presumably not
politically correct!] had previously appeared in the *Jeopardy* time-slot in
the Chicago area for 10 minutes, due to a screwup (<A HREF="/Risks/18.22.html">RISKS-18.22</A>).  Of course,
what comes around goes around; 10 years ago the Playboy Channel was
intentionally disrupted by a CBN employee, with satellite-spoofed
programming declaiming ``Repent Your Sins'' (<A HREF="/Risks/10.62.html">RISKS-10.62</A>).

Being the technophile, or perhaps just temporarily insane, I decided to try
filing my taxes using the IRS's and State of Missouri's "Telefile" system.
These systems allow the user to key in the figures from a simple return on
their touch-tone phone.  The systems also compute several values and speak
them back to the user so that said user can record them for future
reference.

Observations:

1.  Both systems provided my authentication information in an unsealed
packet through the USPS, even though I had not requested this.  Ergo, it
would be quite simple for someone else to file for me.  Ugh.  (Hmm, if I
couldn't file because someone beat me to it, would that count as "Denial of
Service"?)

2.  Both systems use a number as a "user id".  The IRS number seemed
suitably mysterious, but the Missouri number was quite familiar, being of
the form "ABACADADB".  Familiar, that is, because that pattern is also a
perfect match for my Social Security Number.  Ugh.

3.  The user-interface for the IRS system was nice enough, albeit somewhat
tedious.  The Missouri system, on the other hand, had the annoying habit of
rattling off figures at unexpected moments without providing the rattled
user a means for having them repeated.  Ugh.

Each item seems to involve a poor solution to a problem that has superior
solutions that are well-known and relatively simple.

I notice that AltaVista's inline advertisements link to a server outside
Digital, "ad.doubleclick.net", and that the URL includes the user's list of
keywords being searched.  I'm concerned that these URL's may occasionally
leak information about the user's interests and inclinations to third
parties, information which the user may prefer to keep private.

This is not a new problem that appeared with the inline ads, since also the
Referer: field of the HTTP protocol discloses to a target server exactly
what AltaVista index page led the user to it.  However, this requires that
the user willfully follows that link.

If sensitive information being leaked via the Referer: field is a problem,
the user may obtain client software that withholds Referer: data, either
conditionally or unconditionally.  Also, a user who has asked AltaVista for
"gay" pages is probably not too concerned about accidentally disclosing this
fact to the maintainer of said "gay" pages.

However, the doubleclick.net ads appear to bear no relationship to the
keywords being searched, and they appear not only in the URL for the
hyperlink to follow, but also in the IMG SRC URL.  This means that in order
to avoid disclosing my keyword lists to doubleclick.net, I have to disable
automatic loading of inline images when using AltaVista!

Why is it that when I perform a search for, say, "gay OR nazi AND
scientology", AltaVista tricks my browser to give this very search string
away to an advertising company by means of an inline image (the contents of
which has nothing to do with my search)?  I think I can trust the AltaVista
maintainers not to save my keyword lists for future analysis, but what about
an advertising company?

It's kind of serendipity reversed.  When you open a book to look up
information on a specific subject, the book scans your mind to find out what
other interests and hobbies you have.

I was in Las Vegas between Christmans and New Year's, and decided to
purchase some sunglasses from The Sunglass Hut, a large chain of sunglass
retailers in the U.S. and Canada (and perhaps other countries as well).  I
paid for my purchases with my Visa card, the receipt was placed in a special
holder, and I was asked to sign the receipt with an electronic pen.  The
salesman said that they can transmit the signature during the verification
process as an additional check; the signature sent is compared with what
Visa has on file.  I was told that the signature isn't sent always, only in
circumstances where a card might be being watched for unauthorized charges.

All this information came from the salesman; I'd be interested to hear
if anyone has any details about this system.

Story from the Boston Globe via Institute for Global Communications
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:labornews@igc.apc.org">labornews@igc.apc.org</A>&gt;:

To summarize, a company's president has been arrested for manslaughter after
two of his workers were killed in separate accidents, a year apart.  One was
pulled into a machine which lacked basic (and legally required) safety
devices, the other was crushed by a front-end loader with inoperable brakes.
The company had been fined hundreds of thousands of US dollars for dozens of
previous safety violations.  The RISK is contained in the following quote.
Bowley is the president; Codinha is his lawyer:

Codinha said Bowley had ``safety officers'' working in the junkyard when the
accidents occurred. ``This should have been their [the safety officers']
responsibility,'' Codinha said.

This guy seems to believe that you can ignore safety laws simply by hiring
"safety officers" and blaming them when people get killed.

In *CACM*, January 1997, page 15, Robert L. Glass reveals his shocking new
discovery that UNIX time, a 32-bit signed integer representing the number of
seconds after 1969 TAI, will overflow in mid-January 2038.  (``And even
sooner for smaller-word processors.'')

``This is one of those `surely I'm wrong' kinds of findings,'' Glass
writes. ``Surely the designers of Unix anticipated such a problem and have
provided for it.''

Harrrumph. A certain so-called operating system stores time as a 32-bit
unsigned integer representing the number of seconds after 1899. This will
overflow in February 2036. Apparently Glass doesn't realize that UNIX was
cleverly designed to keep on ticking for *more than a million minutes* after
that other system dies of tachyon exposure.

This is all very well known to UNIX programmers. (Proof: A quick search with
DejaNews reveals that there was a ``UNIX will outlive your pathetic OS''
thread on comp.unix.advocacy, one of the most technical UNIX newsgroups, a
few weeks ago. Q.E.D.)

---Dan

P.S. In all seriousness: I'm converting my data to 64-bit signed times,
stored big-endian in 8 bytes, followed by 8 bytes for nanoseconds and
attoseconds just in case. This won't last for more than a few hundred
billion years, but neither will the Sun, and in any case I plan to throw
a big programming party on 1 January 2000000001 to upgrade to 128 bits.

In many contracting situations, it is *illegal* for the contracting agency
to be involved in detailed management.  On EPA contracts (with which I am
familiar), for example, the EPA management specifies *what* and *when* but
is forbidden to even suggest *who* or *how* -- that is left for the
contractor management to determine.

In such circumstances (sub-sub-contracts), the "who has been fired"
information will have to traverse at least 4 layers of bureaucracy (and more
probably 7-10, since in the EPA case it will go through at least 2 layers of
Washington bureaucracy between the prime contractor and local project
management, and maybe two more layers between local management and computer
operations (and computer operations and the computer-operations
contractor)).

Risk: It will take *weeks* to deal with the situation, not hours.

Living in Maryland, I got the Taco Bell item on the local news.  What was
more interesting was what Taco Bell did upon discovering that somehow they
were losing money.  Apparently, instead of checking the receipts or asking
the clerk, they immediately suspected it was a hardware/software problem and
had technicians treat it as such.  Apparently, they caught the guy only
because he was bragging to co-workers about what he had done.  The risks
here are enormous.  They actually brought a computer professor from a nearby
college on the newscast to explain the risks.  [And something else... the
clerk had a history and a criminal record when he was hired.  Taco Bell
refused comment on that].

RISKS does not generally take potshots at the often miserable service
provided by some of your favorite (or least favorite) Internet service
providers (as well as wannabes who still don't provide decent Internet
service), although we have had a few messages in RISKS on this subject, and
on the pain that is caused -- particularly to list administrators.  This
time, my patience has run out.  For a very long time, I have been getting
bouncemail from "System Mailman" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:usfmcsqc@ibmmail.com">usfmcsqc@ibmmail.com</A>&gt; on every issue of
RISKS, telling me that

"Your note to SSTARKEY on FORD of [date/time] could not be delivered
because SSTARKEY is not currently a valid userid on node FORD."

The bouncemail tells me absolutely nothing else to give me a clue.  On the
RISKS lists I maintain (at CSL) or know about (BITNET), there is no RISKS
subscriber named STARKEY and no node named FORD.  I suppose I could bother
all of the altruistic folks who are already providing redirection services
(.mil, .uk, .mit.edu, .xerox.com, .dec.com -- many thanks!), but that seems
unlikely to be productive, and, besides, I should not have to do that each
time something like this happens.  [Oh, yes, you guessed correctly; IBMmail
is not the only offender.]  So, I have sent e-mail to various addresses at
IBMmail -- including Postmaster, Action, Help, and "System Mailman"
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:usfmcsqc@ibmmail.com">usfmcsqc@ibmmail.com</A>&gt; -- TO NO AVAIL.  So, a veil is now withdrawn, and I
hope that by my going public, someone else will be inspired to do something
useful -- such as one of the many IBMmail subscribers prodding an
administrator at IBMmail to modify their BARFmail facility, or someone who
knows STARKEY telling him/her to let me know what alias is being used, or
anything else that might help.  Not only do I *not* get a response from
IBMmail with some excuse such as perhaps that they are incompetent or
otherwise impaired, I also do not get a bounce that "System Mailman" could
not receive my message.  IBMmail administration seems to be a veritable
electronic black hole.

IBMmail flame off.  PGN

Incidentally, I'm hard-pressed to keep up with the backlog these days.  (I
just deleted, without reading, 15 pieces of what appeared to be unsolicited
advertisements in the RISKS directory, which came in over the weekend.  I
just hope that none of them was a well-meaning RISKS contribution!)

I notice that AOL seems to have shot itself in the foot by going to
flat-rate charges.  The 17 Jan 1997 media reports indicate AOL is now
asking its customers not to use their services so much, because of the
difficulties of other people gaining access.  Reportedly, many folks are
threatening to sue because they cannot get the access they think they
deserve -- and are paying for.

When I was in grad school, I once got a letter from a professor that berated
a fellow student for not attending seminars and how he'd better get his act
together if he wanted to keep working with that prof.  I could not
understand why I was "cc'd" on the letter, as it would have been
unprofessional to do so.

Looking closer at the e-mail, I figured out what had happened.  The
professor had typed the subject into the "To:" field, which was something
like "Please attend all ai symposiums in the future".  The only thing the
mail understood from that subject was that there was a mailing list called
"ai", which it promptly sent the letter to (even though it was busy giving
errors about the rest fo the subject).

The reply was short, "now that the whole department knows I'm lazy, can we
meet in private about this?".

Why does this happen?

- Too easy to hit the final carriage return and then say oops.
- The software (generic unix mail) failed to treat the entire
e-mail as faulty.  If one of a group of instructions is faulty,
the entire group should be invalidated.
- Mail was sent to the back-end before the addresses were verified.
- Aliases set up with the same name as common words, a longer name
would have been harder to mistype.
- Apparently there was no warning that there was no subject given,
or it was ignored.

The risks?
- Software systems not keeping up with society; thus a simple system
for sending memos and ideas evolves into a full communications
paradigm that is widely used, except it's the same old software
with the same old assumptions.
- And of course, using easy technology for something that should have
been done the old-fashioned way.  A tendency to sit behind the desk
and control the world from the console in front  of you.

The old rule applies - never say anything on usenet or e-mail that you
wouldn't mind being posted in the office lunchroom.  Chances are, it just
might end up there.

The chances of mistyping an e-mail address and getting a valid one are far
higher than Gerard A. Joseph recently suggested. On Lotus CC:mail, which use
at work, as you type a name it searches for a match in a predefined list. I
am sure many other mail systems work in a similar fashion. In my case the
list includes the entire company of a few thousand users.

I have a long time friend in California, to whom I would say just about
anything. Because of distance/time difference e-mail is our main social
means of communication. His name is Michael. My boss, about whom I might
occasionally say things that I would not want him to hear (or read), also
has the name Michael. One day about five minutes after I had sent a message
to my long time friend, my boss shouted over the partition in the office -
"Hey Niall, I think you meant this mail for someone else." It took about 2
seconds to realise what had happened and 2 seconds to start sweating. I had
typed Michael, and got the first Michael alphabetically. I needed only one
more letter to make the name unique and then the return key made the
selection. I had pressed an R instead of an M. Event though the wrong
address was at the top of the message as I typed, I never noticed it.

Luckily the mail was a harmless one, but I was far more careful in future.

The risk of course is that with such a system, especially if it can be
customised to select only people to whom you regularly send e-mail (I do not
know enough about CC:mail to know if this can be done), then the chances
become quite high that the misdirected e-mail goes to someone you know. This
can easily be more embarrassing than having it go to a random person
somewhere in cyberspace.

While misaddressing provides trivial access to information in the e-mail
(the unintended recipient didn't go to any effort to obtain it), it's
irrelevant.

Far more relevant: "Nothing about the Internet" provides *any* privacy to
*any* e-mail content, whether delivered to a valid address or not.  Thus, you
should *never* commit "intensely private" (or embarrassing, or fiscal, etc.)
content to e-mail. A stamped, sealed paper mail document (or a telephone
connection) is far more secure &amp; reliable.

There's also no guarantee that a message sent out actually arrives, nor that
you'll hear about it if it doesn't. It is *often* the case that mail is
looked at only by the addressee, mail sent to a valid address arrives there,
and you get a bounce message for invalid addresses, but there are no
"guarantees" on *any* of this. The system works well enough most of the time
that naive users perceive it as "like paper mail, only faster and cheaper" -
a perception which is deeply flawed.

Periodically I remind you of TWO useful digests related to privacy, both of
which are siphoning off some of the material that would otherwise appear in
RISKS, but which should be read by those of you vitally interested in
privacy problems.  RISKS will continue to carry general discussions in which
risks to privacy are a concern.

* The PRIVACY Forum is run by Lauren Weinstein, with some support from the
ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy.  He manages it as a rather
selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the full
range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
(with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
Forum, please send the exact line:

<A HREF="mailto:privacy-request@vortex.com">privacy-request@vortex.com</A>

You will receive a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit

Forum Archive is available through the World Wide Web access address.

* The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
run by Leonard P. Levine.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
<A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy@uwm.edu">comp-privacy@uwm.edu</A> and administrative requests to
<A HREF="mailto:comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu">comp-privacy-request@uwm.edu</A>.

There is clearly much potential for overlap between the two digests,
although contributions tend not to appear in both places.  If you are very
short of time and can scan only one, you might want to try the former.  If
you are interested in ongoing discussions, try the latter.  Otherwise, it
may well be appropriate for you to read both, depending on the strength of
your interests and time available.

The SEI Conference on Risk Management - Preliminary Program
Managing Uncertainty in a Changing World.
7-9 April 1997
The Cavalier Hotel
Virginia Beach, Virginia

The SEI Conference on Risk Management provides a unique forum for exchanging
ideas and experiences with experts and professionals who practice or study
acquisition and risk management. It is a tremendous opportunity for you to
increase your awareness and to advance your knowledge and skills by exposure
to the latest methods, tools, techniques, and some of the best practices in
the field of system development and acquisitions.

The conference is geared toward government, industry, and academic managers,
practitioners, change agents, and researchers.  Managers will learn how to
improve their ability to make informed decisions and to gain better control
of their project's cost, schedule, and technical content.  Practitioners
will increase both their awareness of risks and their ability and skills to
avoid or mitigate them. Development and acquisition professionals will gain
insight from the experiences of leading experts and professionals, learn
about the latest developments and technological issues, and learn how to
manage uncertainty in a changing world.

If you haven't attended an SEI Conference on Risk Management in the past, you
may want to attend the 1997 conference.  Here's why:

* Recent Congressional action as well as DoD policy emphasizes the requirement
to improve acquisition practices and management of risk.

* The Fiscal Year 1996 Defense Authorization Act directs that "...the process
for acquisition of information technology is a simplified, clear, and
understandable process that specifically addresses the management of risk,
incremental acquisitions, and the need to incorporate commercial information
technology in a timely manner."

* DoD Directive 5000.1 "Defense Acquisition" (March 15, 1996) provides for
"...a streamlined management structure and event-driven management process
that emphasizes risk management and affordability and that explicitly links
milestone decisions to demonstrated accomplishments."

[John van Heteren  <A HREF="mailto:vanhet@sirius.com">vanhet@sirius.com</A> found this press release on
<A HREF="http://www.urel.berkeley.edu/releases/">http://www.urel.berkeley.edu/releases/</A> and sent it to comp.dcom.telecom .]

Berkeley -- It took UC Berkeley graduate student Ian Goldberg only three and
a half hours to crack the most secure level of encryption that the federal
government allows U.S. companies to export.

[On 28 Jan 1997] RSA Data Security Inc. challenged the world to decipher a
message encrypted with its RC5 symmetric stream cipher, using a 40-bit key,
the longest keysize allowed for export.  RSA offered a $1,000 reward,
designed to stimulate research and practical experience with the security of
today's codes.

Goldberg succeeded a mere 3.5 hours after the contest began, which provides
very strong evidence that 40-bit ciphers are totally unsuitable for
practical security.  "This is the final proof of what we've known for years:
40-bit encryption technology is obsolete," Goldberg said.

RSA's RC5 cipher can however be used with longer keysizes, ranging from 40
to 2,048 bits, to provide increasing levels of security.

U.S. export restrictions have limited the deployment of technology that
could greatly strengthen security on the Internet, often affecting both
foreign and domestic users, Goldberg said.  "We know how to build strong
encryption; the government just won't let us deploy it. We need strong
encryption to uphold privacy, maintain security, and support commerce on the
Internet -- these export restrictions on cryptography must be lifted, " he
said.

Fittingly, when Goldberg finally unscrambled the challenge message, it read:
"This is why you should use a longer key."

The number of bits in a cipher is an indication of the maximum level of
security the cipher can provide, Goldberg said. Each additional bit doubles
the potential security level of the cipher. A recent panel of experts
recommended using 90-bit ciphers, and 128-bit ciphers are commonly used
throughout the world, but U.S. government regulations restrict exportable
U.S. products to a mere 40 bits.

Goldberg used UC Berkeley's Network of Workstations (NOW) to harness the
computational resources of about 250 idle machines. This allowed him to test
100 billion possible "keys" per hour -- analogous to safecracking by trying
every possible combination at high speed. This amount of computing power is
available with little overhead cost to students and employees at many large
educational institutions and corporations.

Goldberg is a founding member of the ISAAC computer security research group
at UC Berkeley, which is led by assistant professor of computer science Eric
Brewer. In the fall of 1995 the ISAAC group made headlines by revealing a
major security flaw in Netscape's web browser.

[This item appeared more or less intact in various news media.  Ian also
was featured in a live hookup at the RSA Data Security Conference on 29 Jan,
and noted that the key was found after exhausting only 30% of the keyspace.
2**41.5 workstation-microseconds were expended, at a rate of 1 million
keys every 6 seconds.  Nifty piece of work.  Incidentally, longer RC5 key
lengths have increasingly higher prizes, and may still be up for grabs.
Also, as I recall, one DES key is worth $10,000.  PGN]

An internal Social Security Administration (SSA) report described in the 17
Jan 1997 *Washington Post* states that $234 billion worth of wage reports,
some going back to 1937, cannot be matched to individual accounts.  The wage
reports are used to compute benefits.  The San Bernadino SSA District
Headquarters states that their computer system is 'confounded' by Asian,
Latino, Native American and Islamic names.  Surnames with spaces, such as
'de la Rosa' or where the surname is not at the end of the name, such as
'Park Chong Kyu' are typical of those mishandled.  Women who change their
names when getting married also constitute a large portion of the errors.
The San Bernadino office has corrected 100,000 mismatches of the 200 million
unmatched wage reports.

Rep. George E. Brown Jr. has sought a General Accounting Office
investigation, but has been blocked by House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer.

The RISK here is designing a system for a diverse population without
considering procedures to handle that diversity.

...
&gt; I know some of you have been amused (at best)  by my spellchecker episodes
&gt; in the past few weeks (Hindemith came out as Hindmost was the worst). If
&gt; you're interested, I've discovered the problem, and will share it with
&gt; Microsoft Mail users out there.
&gt;
&gt; In MS Word, if the spellchecker highlights a word it doesn't know, like
&gt; Hindemith, you can click on "add" and it puts Hindemith into its dictionary
...
&gt; In MS Mail, if it highlights a word it doesn't know, and you click on "add,"
&gt; it puts the highlighted correction it offered into the dictionary as a
&gt; permanent correction. Since "Hindmost" was the first offered correction, it
&gt; permanently noted that every time I type Hindemith, it would substitute
&gt; Hindmost.

So in one interface, "add" means "add this word, as-is, to the dictionary."
In the other, "add" means "add this suggested replacement to the dictionary
and never ask me again."

Incidentally, ispell users have been asking for the latter feature for
years, but I have stubbornly refused because I think that automated
replacement is far too RISKy to trust a computer.

The Berlin newspaper "Tagespiegel" reports on 29 Jan 97 about a television
show broadcast the previous evening on which hackers from the Chaos Computer
Club demonstrated how to electronically transfer funds without needing a PIN
(Personal Identification Number) or TAN (Transaction Number).

Apparently it suffices for the victim to visit a site which downloads an
ActiveX application, which automatically starts and checks to see if
Quicken, a popular financial software package that also offers electronic
funds transfer, is on the machine. If so, Quicken is given a transfer order
which is saved by Quicken in its pile of pending transfer orders. The next
time the victim sends off the pending transfer orders to the bank (and
enters in a valid PIN and TAN for that!)  all the orders (= 1 transaction)
are executed -&gt; money is transferred without the victim noticing!

The newspaper quotes various officials at Microsoft et al expressing
disbelief/outrage/"we're working on it". We discussed this briefly in class
looking for a way to avoid the problem. Demanding a TAN for each transfer is
not a solution, for one, the banks only send you 50 at a time, and many
small companies pay their bills in bunches. Having to enter a TAN for each
transaction would be quite time-consuming. Our only solution would be to
forbid browsers from executing any ActiveX component without express
authorization, but that rather circumvents part of what ActiveX is intended
for.

A small consolation: the transfer is trackable, that is, it can be
determined at the bank to which account the money went. Some banks even
include this information on the statement, but who checks every entry on
their statements...

In an advertisement in the latest issue of _Time_ magazine (3 February
1997, Canadian edition), Corel mentions the existence of Word macro
viruses as a reason to prefer WordPerfect:

Virus Free* -- Steer clear of the recently identified Microsoft (r) Word
macro viruses. With Corel WordPerfect Suite 7 and Corel Office
Professional 7, it's safe to share documents with your co-workers.
[* Source: _WordPerfect for Windows Magazine_, November 1996, p. 21]

It will be interesting to see if WordPerfect really does profit from this
problem. Personally, I'm still using WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS! ;-)

According to BBC Radio 4's "Today" programme this morning (January 27th
1997), a hospital in Bristol, England, has created a "medical simulation
centre".  The flagship effort of this centre is a "patient simulator" on
which medical students, doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc can "practise"; the
idea being, presumably, to make the really bad mistakes before getting to
real live patients, similarly to how airline pilots are trained.

The following points came to mind as I listened to the centre's spokesperson
presenting this huge breakthrough in medical training:

1. To what extent will the bedside manner of many doctors be enhanced by
training on an unfeeling robot ?

2. The simulator apparently cost GBP 250,000.  Does anyone else feel that
US$400,000, or two person-years of relatively inexpensive systems consultant
time, is perhaps on the low side for a full simulation of what took
evolution several million years to achieve ?  Or maybe the simulation is
perfect and only the centre's accounting software has problems ?

3. Anyone want to be next month's paycheck that administering 32767
milligrams of any substance to the simulator will not cause a previously
present, non-zero quantity of that substance to go negative and thus
disappear ?  Once medical students discover that a blood alcohol level of
200 milligrams can be reduced by administering the equivalent of six bottles
of vodka, how many will go out and try it, and then sue the simulator's
programmers ?

Can you believe that we have already been hit by a Year 2000 bug?  Today I
went with my part-time PhD student to the library and her card was
rejected. This is because her card expiry date is the year 2000 which,
according to the library computer entry system, is 1900, i.e., her card is
rejected for being out of date.  (She actually has got a print-out which
states that her card expires in 1900.)

Apparently the problem is known to library and security* staff but they have
not done anything about it. Considering how new** the library is, is it not
incredible that such a serious and obvious year 2000 bug was not avoided?

Porn on Net leads to big bills;
Overseas phone flip boosts phone bills, police say
By Robert Brehl - Toronto Star Business Reporter, 29 Jan 1997

A bizarre scam involving pornography on the Internet has cost victims
hundreds of dollars, Royal Canadian Mounted Police say.

Some victims have been unknowingly charged up to $1,200 to download
porn from the Web site (sexygirls.com), said Corporal Marc Gosselin,
of the RCMP's computer crime unit.

Gosselin said the scam worked this way:

The website informs Internet surfers that looking at nude pictures is free.
To see the pictures, ``a special image viewer'' must be clicked on and
downloaded to your home computer.

``And that's a virus, a Trojan horse,'' the Mountie said.

When it is clicked on, the viewer's modem is disconnected from the
regular local Internet service provider, Gosselin said.

Then the dialer volume is turned off, and a phone number in Moldova,
in the former Soviet Union, is dialed.

Surreptitiously, the person's computer in Canada is then hooked to a
phone number in Moldova, Gosselin said.

&gt;From Moldova, the call is bounced back to a computer in Scarborough
where the pornographic pictures are stored.

``You're accessing a server in Scarborough through a long-distance
call to Moldova,'' Gosselin said.

The scam can continue even after viewing the pornography.

That's because Internet surfers may move on to other Internet sites,
but are still unknowingly connected to Moldova and racking up
long-distance charges, Gosselin said in an interview from Montreal.

Because the investigation is continuing and charges are pending, the
Mounties refuse to name the company in Scarborough.

The Star attempted to send an E-mail to officials connected to
(sexygirls.com). The page has an area for sending E-mail, but would
not accept electronic messages from The Star.

The website boasts having had more than 1 million visitors since Jan.
1, 1997. That number could not be verified.

The RCMP has ordered that all calls from Canada to the number in
Moldova not be connected, so this scam has been stopped, the corporal
said.

But telecommunications experts say oodles of other potential scams are
out there, and consumers should beware.

Ian Angus, author of the book Phone Pirates, said using the Internet
is the latest twist in scamming people on long-distance charges.

``It's not just a dirty trick, it's business, big money,'' Angus said.

That's because it's common for phone companies in foreign countries to
try to attract calls from the lucrative North American market, he
said.

Bell will look at each case before deciding whether to waive the
charges

Typically, foreign phone companies enlist entrepreneurs to generate
calls and then, in turn, pay the entrepreneurs a percentage of each
call.

Canadian phone companies ``must pay international settlement charges
to foreign countries even if they can't collect at home,'' said Angus,
president of Angus Telemanagement.

Bell Canada spokesperson John Peck said the company will look at each
complaint before deciding whether to waive the charges.

``But we're on the hook for it, too,'' Peck said. ``Chances are the
individual will be held responsible.''

If Bell waived the charges, other Bell customers and shareholders
would be subsidizing the charges rung up, unknowingly or not, by
people downloading pornography.

Gosselin and Angus said Bell probably won't get too many complaints
because of the embarrassment factor for victims forced to admit what
they were doing in order to argue for a rebate.

The RCMP has had 20 complaints so far, but hundreds of others have
probably been taken, Gosselin said.

He said it would be several weeks before any charges are laid related
to unauthorized access to computers and fraud.

Lucky Green (<A HREF="/Risks/18.75.html">RISKS-18.75</A>) said:

&gt; The new US crypto export regulations control the export of most if not all
&gt; data-security software. Regardless if the software uses cryptography or
&gt; not. Many software archives seem to be in violation of the new regs. [...]
&gt; This certainly controls virus checkers, firewalls, and other security
&gt; software. There are substantial penalties involved in violating the EAR.
&gt; The US can assess daily penalties and block all exports of a company's
&gt; non-violating products. Criminal penalties apply as well.
&gt;
&gt; "Export", as defined in the new regs, includes making software available on
&gt; the web or via ftp.

After _very_ careful reading of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
(though IANAL), it would seem that the above is slightly inaccurate.

Although, as Lucky pointed out, virus checkers et al. are indeed regulated
for export from the US, and putting software up for ftp or WWW is considered
export, the EAR does _not_ apply to "publicly available" software
(732.2(b)(1)).  Software is publicly available "when it is available for
general distribution either for free or at a price that does not exceed
the cost of reproduction and distribution" (734.7(b)).

Therefore, it would seem that, as long as the security software on your ftp
or WWW site is free of cost, it is OK to keep it there.  Commercial
security software, however, remains export-restricted.

NOTE, however, that products that actually do contain cryptography fall
under an exception (734.7(c)): "Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of
this section, note that encryption software controlled under ECCN 5D002 for
``EI'' reasons on the Commerce Control List (refer to Supplement No. 1 to
part 774 of the EAR) remains subject to the EAR even when publicly
available."

The software controlled for EI reasons under 5D002 are described as: "EI
controls apply to encryption software transferred from the U.S.  Munitions
List to the Commerce Control List consistent with E.O. 13026 of November 15,
1996 (61 FR 58767) and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that
date. Refer to Sec. 742.15 of the EAR."

As virus checkers et al. were not on the Munitions List, they are not
controlled for EI (Encryption Items) reasons, but rather for NS (National
Security) and AT (Anti-Terrorism) reasons.

The RISKS: the government suddenly creating (and putting into effect) new
rules covering large amounts of software, without warning or (in my opinion)
justification.

I subscribe to the Timecast Times mailing list, a fairly low-volume but
large-size announcement mailing list I'm on.  It's not a discussion list but
an announcement list--usually, it sends one ~5-10K file through, once a
week.  Last night, one of these announcement posts bounced, and the bounce
apparently went out to the entire Timecast Times list.

I didn't think too much of this e-mail bounce, hardly even glanced over it.
But this morning, I received about eight more message from said list, mostly
from subscribers saying "Please take me off this list!", some of whom quoted
the entire 8K announcement file along with their message.

Taking a closer look at the messages revealed something rather interesting.
Cause of the bounces aside, the message at the end of Timecast Times that
used to state:

&gt; ** To remove yourself from this mailing list, send a message to
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:tctimes@prognet.com">tctimes@prognet.com</A> with
&gt;
&gt; UNSUBSCRIBE your_e-mail_address
&gt;
&gt; on a single line in the body of the message. **

now reads

&gt; For help subscribing, unsubscribing, and changing your e-mail address,
&gt; send e-mail with the word "Help" in the subject line to
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:tthelp@direct.timecast.com.">tthelp@direct.timecast.com.</A> You will receive an automatic response with
&gt; instructions.

From this, it looks like they've had to change their mailing list software
when they changed the site the list was running from.

Offhand, I'd say there are two major RISKS to be seen in this:

RISK #1 can be found in the advice that when you're switching mailing list
software, it would be a good idea to know what you're doing.  Looks to me
like misconfiguration caused bounces to be sent through the list to its
subscribers, instead of to the listowner alone; e-mail replies to the list
to be sent to the subscribers rather than just the listowner; and maybe even
the original bounces in the first place.  The RISK here is that
misconfiguration can lead to mess-up.

RISK #2 advises that you should make it as _easy_ to unsubscribe as you
possibly can.  Firstly, instructions should be at the _beginning_ of the
message...if you don't want to be receiving the thing, are you really going
to read it down all the way through the end?  Second, it should be clear-cut
and self-evident what to do just by looking at it.  "For help, e-mail here"
just doesn't cut it.  The RISK here resides in people's inherent tendency
toward laziness: People don't want to _work_ to get off a list like this,
they're going to hit that big old 'R' key and say "Take me off, now!"
instead, probably quoting the entire message in the hopes of filling up the
mail spool of whoever they're replying to.

When you combine the RISK of misconfiguration with the RISK of obfuscation,
you get a snowball effect as more and more people reply quoting the entire
message, causing more and more mailboxes to fill up or more time to be spent
downloading junk e-mail, causing more and more people to reply...

Thanks to the more than 100 people who replied to my posting (many of them
to my msof-address :-).

Many of you suggested that msof might be in my "AutoCorrect" word list, and
some were wondering who had put it there. It turns out that the problem is
related, but not due to "AutoCorrect". It seems that Word97 not only has an
"AutoCorrect" feature, but also an independent "AutoText" with
"AutoComplete" feature, and this is what's causing the visible substitution
effect. AutoText has a word list that includes such wonderful phrases as
Best Regards,
Dear Mom and Dad,
Dear Sir or Madam,
Love,
and, yes, you guessed it,
MSOffice.

When you have AutoComplete turned on, which is the default after
installation, anything you type that matches an AutoText entry is expanded
when you press Enter or Tab. For example, typing the four letters "to w"
(with a blank between o and w) and then the Tab key, will yield the string
"To Whom It May Concern:" on your screen.

This still doesn't explain, however, why the MS Office installer performs
such auto-text expansions on existing user-preference files when upgrading
from Word 95 to Word 97. Might it be that, internally, this is actually
performed by parsing the old configuration file and writing out a new one
*using Word itself*? Then, if the new-configuration-writer would type msof
followed by a Tab or a Return, you would get MSOffice...

Yesterday, I registered my mother to MCI as an ISP.  They create your access
codes, which are long mixed characters, for what they call security.  They
aren't very informative about how to use the services or an explanation on
your user codes, they ask for you to create a code or phrase in the
beginning on registering, for authentication if you have problems with
service etc.  They also give you your first.lastname as your userid.

So, I accessed the MCI server with the strange code, but when I got to my
mothers e-mail stuff there was another code they created for security, but
it wouldn't authenticate.  So, I called them telling them I was my mother
and asked for the username code and password code.  The only thing they
asked me for was my mother's home address prior to giving me the codes!  I
could have been anyone asking for the username codes and passwords!  They
gave me both codes, one for accessing the server and the e-mail one!

What worries me about all this, is that it doesn't take much to know if
someone has an account on MCI and get their address?  Then, just call in
saying that you forgot your codes and then login, purchase MCI's products
online using the credit card that you gave MCI to bill you monthly?  Right?

The funny thing is that they earlier asked for a phrase etc. for service...
but they didn't ask me for it?  They didn't ask me for the accounting codes
or service codes that they provided after registration on the browser?  Just
the physical home address?

Is this dangerous or what?  I immediately had my mother cancel the service
with them.  Please look into this and see if they do this to other people?
I am worried how easy it is to do this with other providers other than MCI?

From the subtitle, "The Seductions of Computer Technology", one can,
perhaps, assume that the book is not going to be an unalloyed apologia for
the computer.  Poor old technology seems to be a popular stuffed lion to
kick these days.  Rawlins' book, more like a series of articles, is more
informed and erudite than most, but readers of, say, the RISKS-FORUM Digest
will find this to be thoroughly plowed ground.

Rawlins looks at encryption (rather well, actually), virtual reality,
information technology, the net, weapons technology, and employment.
Chapter 7 gets a little out of hand: it finishes with two (not terribly
good) science fiction "cautionary tale" set pieces.  The final chapter moves
out into the realm of technology in general, but returns to a bit more
balanced view.

On Monday, 13 Jan 1997, Vineyard.NET was apparently attacked by a
spam-for-hire company.  The organization, "CV Communications," connected to
our SMTP server and started sending us advertisements for its own spamming
services.

I discovered the attack after approximately 66,000 messages were sent.  Most
of them went to subscribers of AOL and CompuServe.  I contacted the spammer,
using the phone number at the bottom of each message he was sending out, and
demanded that he stop.

Spamming is a known problem on the Internet.  I'm hopeful that
law-enforcement agencies will start seriously looking into this problem, as
I think that there is a limit to how effective technological solutions can
be.

However, there are several solutions that I have thought of.

1. Limit the number of RECV recipients permitted in each SMTP transaction.

Rather than sending out tens of thousands of messages, we were hit with a
few hundred messages that each had more than 100 recipients. We have
therefore modified our netperm-table file to limit the number of recipients
that each SMTP connection can have.

2. Disallow transiting.

Vineyard.NET's SMTP server is used both by our customers to send out
messages and by others on the Internet to send us messages. But it shouldn't
be used by others on the Internet to send messages through us to third
parties. We have therefore modified our SMTP server so that it can tell the
difference between an internal connection and an external
connection. External connections are not allowed to transit through us to
other external mail servers.

3. Reject messages that come from "suspicious" sources.

We have not implemented this yet. However, it seems reasonable to reject out
of hand any SMTP message from certain kinds of hosts. For example, you might
want to reject those from addresses that do not have a valid domain name, or
from hosts that appear to be dialup addresses.

I have written an article about this spamming incident which will appear in
my 28 Jan 1997 Packet column. You can view it at
<A HREF="http://www.packet.com/garfinkel">http://www.packet.com/garfinkel</A> on Wednesday January 29th.

I have also made my modified SMTP server available. It is located at
<A HREF="http://simson.vineyard.net/hw/spam2/smap.c">http://simson.vineyard.net/hw/spam2/smap.c</A> . This is a modified version of
the Trusted Information System's SMAP server, part of their firewall
toolkit. It is my understanding that FWTK is no longer being maintained by
TIS, which is a pity.

Last summer, contractors at Commonwealth Edison's LaSalle nuclear
power station were filling cracks in a concrete floor by pumping them
full of foam grout.  What the workers didn't know, though, was that a
tunnel ran beneath that floor, carrying water for some safety systems at
the plant, and their grout was pouring through the cracks into the water.
The grout partially clogged the tunnel, compromising safety at the plant
for 10 days before Edison -- when pushed by federal inspectors -- finally
figured out what was wrong.  [*Chicago Tribune*, 25 Jan 1997, front page]

The NRC levied a $650,000 fine for what they called a "very significant
safety problem."  Without getting into a debate about nuclear power, I think
one could point out the risk in thinking that there are any non-critical
jobs where critical systems are concerned.

A program error caused Schwab's computers to omit a significant number of
mutual funds when investors used Telebroker to track holdings by phone,
leading some of them to believe themselves broke.  The problem existed from
Monday afternoon through late Tuesday evening scaring scores of investors.
Janus, Putnam and Schwab's own funds were among those omitted from net asset
calculations.

Tracey Gordon, Schwab spokeswoman: "We were making some system changes when
there was a program error."  On why the problem went on so long: 'Mutual
funds are priced once a day.  We found that it would be cleaner and simpler
to wait until the next regularly scheduled market change to update the
system'.  Cleaner and simpler for Schwab, presumably.  Gordon said investors
who made panicky trades as a result 'would be made whole' but there'd be
risks in determining both the who and the how much.

My full name is Michael Steffen Oliver Franz, which makes my initials
"msof". I usually use these initials in internal correspondence, and I
have an e-mail address "<A HREF="mailto:msof@sprynet.com">msof@sprynet.com</A>".

Now, I just installed Microsoft Office 97 on my computer.

Curiously, Office 97 automatically replaces some occurrences of "msof" by
"Microsoft Office". For example, this happens in the "initials" box in the
Word Annotations dialog. I am not yet sure how far-reaching this automatism
is, but the prospect of having my name replaced without my knowledge is
frightening. You can see this strange effect for yourself if you type "msof"
at the start of a line in Word and then wait for a short time.

An article in the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet (1997 Jan 24)
currently available on their web site <A HREF="http://www.svd.se/">http://www.svd.se/</A> describes research
carried out by Ericsson Saab Avionics by Karin Johansson that suggests that
computers, especially those carried on high-altitude aircraft flights, may
be at risk for cosmic radiation.

Johansson and her colleagues carried out experiments on SAS transcontinental
(Atlantic) flights that measured one [bit] error per memory chip per 200
hours. The article notes that a modern personal computer may have 64 such
chips. This means that an ordinary laptop PC may expect an error every three
hours, or about twice during an atlantic flight. [Assuming you brought
enough batteries.] The problem is worsened when the flight path is over the
North Pole because the earth's magnetic field, which normally protects
against cosmic radiation, is directed such that the protection is lessened.

Karin Johansson notes that the computers used to control the aircraft itself
"are not the absolutely most modern, and consequently their electronic
circuits are not as small and sensitive." However, component manufacturers
are not interested in building electronics for such a small market as
avionics, so the aircraft manufacturers must use the electronics available
in the marketplace. To protect against error, aircraft computer designers
will use parity and error-correcting circuitry to prevent a single-bit error
from propagating into other computation.

The Shetland Times has obtained a preliminary injunction against the
Shetland News to prevent the News's web site from linking to Times
documents. Part of the judge's reasoning was that the advertising material
on the "front page" of the Times could thus be bypassed.

I did an AltaVista search on the phrase "Shetland Times" and came up with
lots of links into the depths of the Shetland Times site. Presumably DEC has
committed the same offense as the Shetland News, and their new European
mirror site might be vulnerable to a similar challenge.

Given the usual response to any attempts to remove "offensive" or "illegal"
material from the Net, I'm surprised that I didn't turn up dozens of
third-party links into the Shetland Times site, in defiance of the reasoning
behind the injunction.

The judgement, as I believe it should be interpreted, means that it is the
duplication of the headlines themselves which breached the copyright
law. Whether they link to the original Shetland Times articles or different
articles on the same story is irrelevant.  The judge believes that the
headlines constitute a separate work.

It think that his decision was in line with the intention and spirit of the
copyright law.

Also, I note that RISKS contributions with URLs seem to be increasingly

This contains '10695' at the end, which is what identifies the user and

change in personal preferences !

&gt;Macintosh users probably have less cause for concern about the year 2000
&gt;than any other computer users, thanks to Apple's farsighted programmers.

This gem illustrates just how nasty the Y2K issue is.  The internal
representation of the date is only one small Y2K problem.  The others
include:

- are the library functions robust?  Are they correct?  (E.g.,
can they tell you whether 2000 is a leap year?  The date of
Memorial Day in 2017?  The date of Easter in 2004?  The number
of business days between any two arbitrary dates?)

- do the developers actually call these functions, or do they
write their own?

- do the developers always display 4-digit years?  If not, do they
always truncate the year correctly?

- do the developers alway require 4-digit years?  If not, how do
they interpret shorter years?

Bottom line: if mac programs are intrinsically Y2K safe due _solely_ to the
representation selected by the godlike system designers at Apple, then all
C++ programs are intrinsically bug free and fault tolerant since that
language was designed to include resources to help make software engineering
manageable.

Ahh, but how do your _applications_ store dates?  If only the last two
digits are stored on disk then you have a problem, no matter how many bits
your system clock uses.  Good hardware design only provides a false sense of
security when the programmers get sloppy.

This isn't particularly novel. DEC's VMS operating system (designed in the
mid-1970s) also implements the date as a 64-bit signed integer giving the
number of microseconds since the Smithsonian base date of (I think) 17th
November 1858.  +ve numbers are regarded as absolute values, -ve ones as
deltas, but even so the VMS clock is good for many millenia.

In addition to that all date displays use a 4-digit year. There is a
well-known bug filed against VMS pointing out that the date displays will be
incorrect after Dec 31st 9999. The bug was accepted by DEC with the note "we
will fix this in a future major architecture."

In RISKS 18.78, Dan Hicks wrote:
&gt; I prefer a floating-point format ...

Note that if you are measuring intervals by subtracting timestamps, then the
use of floating point numbers for the timestamps can lead to hard-to-debug
errors in accuracy.

The Patriot missile failure in Dhahran was caused by a similar error: values
from the system clock (integer number of tenths of seconds since powerup)
were converted into floating point values to do the intercept math.  After
some number of days of operation, the point floated, and the accuracy
suffered.  [See <A HREF="/Risks/13.35.html">RISKS-13.35</A>]

While it can be argued that this merely means that intervals should not
be measured by subtraction like this, I think that floating-point system
clocks would only increase the RISK of such an error.

The obvious defense against hostile or undesirable web sites is to not visit
them in the first place.  This process can in fact be automated in
netscape's browser.  This saves bandwidth and your time!

The basic premise is that the browser may optionally execute a function on
every URL before it is accessed to determine whether a direct connection
should be made or a proxy should be used in the process.  This affords the
opportunity to [mis]direct the browser to fetch the document from an invalid
source.  this is a good approximation of not getting the document at all.

We sit behind a fire wall, so all WWW access has to funnel through a
proxy.  If I tell netscape to fetch an external document using a
direct connection, the connection attempt will fail, and the document
will not be accessed.  Netscape will put a broken image icon in its
place.

Here are the nuts and bolts to do it, but some assembly is required:
Under options/network preferences/proxies, select "automatic proxy
config" and tell it which file to use.  Call it something like
"file:///HOMEDIR/.netscape/proxy.pac", replacing HOMEDIR with your
home directory; the actual code is included below.
Next, go to options/general preferences/helpers and create an
application helper of type "application/x-ns-proxy-autoconfig" for
suffix "pac", handled by "navigator".
Install this java-script code to do the actual filtering.  call it
"file:///HOMEDIR/.netscape/proxy.pac", as mentioned before.

================
function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
if ( isResolvable(host) &amp;&amp; ! shExpMatch(host, "[0-9]*") )
return "DIRECT" ;
else if (host == "advertising.quote.com")
return "DIRECT" ;
else if (host == "ad.doubleclick.net")
return "DIRECT" ;
else if (shExpMatch(url, "*:*/ads/*"))
return "DIRECT" ;
else
return "PROXY webcache:8080; ";

Net.abuse (spamming, mailbombing, systematic trolling, etc) are being fought
via filters, among other things. This leads to unexpected risks for innocent
bystanders.

Having a similar domain name as a known net.abuser can make you guilty by
confusion: if a spammer operates from earthFOO.com, and you are
earthBAR.com, people are going to confuse the two domains.  This has already
happened (for suitable values of FOO and BAR -- the common earth prefix was
actually used).

If it happens in a discussion, it can be (and has been)
corrected.  If it happens in a router, filter, or other software,
it can be difficult to even detect.

A similar thing applies to IP numbers. Many sites now block all IP addresses
belonging to problematic sites. If at a later date those addresses are
reclaimed by the ISP and re-assigned to another client, that client will
still be blocked. Given the worries about IPv4 numbers running out,
especially for smaller ISPs, this isn't unthinkable.

I put the following in my /etc/hosts (yea, unix-centric, too bad):

127.0.0.1 localhost ad.doubleclick.net

End of problem.  I suppose if not already running a WWW server
one could even put in a simple script invoked by inetd :

#!/bin/sh
echo "Content-type: image/gif"
echo ""
cat /usr/local/etc/nyah-nyah-nyah.gif

if it makes you happier....

I suppose the risk is if ad-avoidance becomes popular enough that browser
makers make it easy, then everyone does it, then an unintended consequence
might be the hastening of the "pay-per-viewing" of the internet.

A side benefit of proxy-server/firewalls is that they somewhat mask the
identity of web-browsing folks behind them.  When I refuse cookies and
access Internet resources through the firewall of a large organization I get
much of the anonymity I might want.  I suggest that ISP's should offer to
proxy their small customers' browsing just to give them this benefit.

Actually, the risks of misaddressing occur in any communication medium.  We
all receive paper mail that isn't for us; since most of us check addresses
before opening mail, privacy is usually preserved at least (as it would be
if we used the electronic equivalent of envelopes -- encryption).  We all
receive phone calls that aren't for us; since the telephone is an
interactive medium it is customary to verify the identify of the person at
the other end before exchanging messages, thus preserving privacy and
ensuring that the message reaches the right person.

In 18.77, <A HREF="mailto:darin@connectnet1.connectnet.com">darin@connectnet1.connectnet.com</A> (Darin Johnson) writes:
&gt;The old rule applies - never say anything on usenet or e-mail that you
&gt;wouldn't mind being posted in the office lunchroom.  Chances are, it just
&gt;might end up there.

Actually, the place where this event is most common is on the MU* (MUD,
MUSH, MUCK, MOO, MUX, etc.) systems, where it is known as a "mav". When
sending a private message (page, whisper) to someone, it is very easy to 1)
send a message to the wrong person, typically somebody else you are talking
to or 2) mistype the command so everybody in the room sees the message. On
fancier systems which allow a user to automatically reply to the last person
who paged them, it is common (especially when the net is lagging) to get a
page from person B while typing a reply to person A and thereby accidentally
send the reply to person B.

Despite a lot of fallout and embarrassment from these incidents, nobody has
come up with a good way of reducing them -- if people won't double-check
what they type, there's nothing software can do to save them.

Also in 18.77, <A HREF="mailto:Lawrence.H.Smith@williams.edu">Lawrence.H.Smith@williams.edu</A> (Lawrence H Smith) writes:
&gt; ... naive users perceive it as "like paper mail, only faster and cheaper" -
&gt; a perception which is deeply flawed.

Actually, the perception that paper mail is reliable is deeply flawed.
Comparing the performance of the US Postal Service to that of the net in my
nine-plus years on the net, I would have to say that paper mail is at least
as bad if not worse. The post office loses several pieces of mail on me
every year. Their latest goof-up was to misdeliver a piece of mail to the
wrong address (wrong *state*, even!) three times before bouncing it back to
me. Now, this failure mode is shared by electronic mail, but the post office
took two months as opposed to a few hours.

The university of Guelph has a simple policy for creating e-mail accounts:
first initial, last name (i.e., <A HREF="mailto:tburgess@uoguelph.ca">tburgess@uoguelph.ca</A>). This scheme works
great as long as their are no duplicates (ie Tom Burgess). If there are
duplicates then they start adding numbers to the e-mail ID or simply using
first names.

When my brother came to Guelph my Dad tried sending e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:jburgess@uoguelph.ca">jburgess@uoguelph.ca</A> which was not my brother's e-mail account. My brother
had been given the account <A HREF="mailto:joel@uoguelph.ca">joel@uoguelph.ca</A>. Luckily the person who got the
e-mail was nice enough to look up the correct address and forward it to my
brother.

The RISKs? E-mail ID schemes like this work great as long as there are no
duplicate names. The moment there are duplicate names then a lot people are
going to start seeing other people's e-mail.

As for Kamens's (RISKS 18.78) comment about paper mail vs. e-mail. I think
it would be fair to say that it is easier to get an e-mail address wrong
then a paper address wrong. E-mail delivery systems only have the e-mail
address to go on when delivering mail. If your e-mail ID doesn't match then
tough it bounces.

Mail addresses have fields like name, address, city, country and postal code
to assist in delivering mail. Failing that post offices can open mail in
hopes of finding the correct address. I know people who have worked in post
offices in small towns and they say they can usually determine where to send
a letter simply on the name alone (even if the address is incorrect or
missing).

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.78.html">RISKS-18.78</A> <A HREF="mailto:Mike_Perry@DGE.ceo.dg.com">Mike_Perry@DGE.ceo.dg.com</A> and others discuss the problem of
verifying e-mail addresses as correct, rather than just hitting the send key.

The obvious solution ("Do you really want to send this? y/n") would
undoubtably work no better than it does for file deletion.

It occurred to me that perhaps what's needed is verifying something besides
words on the screen; that if I am dealing with two kinds of sensory data
something is more likely to click. e.g. a voice saying:

"Sending mail to Ann Landers &lt;<A HREF="mailto:al@annland.org">al@annland.org</A>&gt;, OK?" and my saying "yes" or
"no" (well within a modern machines abilities). Perhaps even do a little
scan for hot words and have it ask: "Do you really want to use the word
'braindead' in your mail to 'boss'?".

Although this is probably silly regarding e-mail (and adds a host of risks
of its own) such warnings attached to particularly risky commands and
forcing a person to do something *unusual* to continue could prevent a lot
of errors, if not overused.

(Note, something similar happens when the WinNT 4.0 license appears on the
screen while installing that product. To continue you have to hit F8, and
only F8. You are pretty much forced to at least glance at the license in
order to continue. Annoying but rather slick. Taking it one step further:
the key could needed could be chosen at random from the non-letters.)

&gt; ... AOL seems to have shot itself in the foot by going to flat-rate charges.

Complicating the access problem (which I haven't experienced personally) is
that AOL keeps putting up a piece of software that seems to block internet
traffic.  Despite repeated attempts to explain the problem, this software
still appears (almost every other day) without the original problems getting
fixed.  I believe it's very hard to determine whether the new pricing has
anything to do with their problems as long as they keep putting up software
that doesn't work.

The (London) *Times* 21 Jan 1997 carries a report of the court case
concerning whether the use of headlines taken from the *Shetland Times'* web
site, as links back to the stories at that site, was a breach of copyright.
This article is carried in full in the electronic version of The Times, at
<A HREF="http://www.the-times.co.uk/news/pages/tim/97/01/21/timlawscl01001.html?1069542">http://www.the-times.co.uk/news/pages/tim/97/01/21/timlawscl01001.html?1069542</A>
though it may be necessary to register to get it by going in through their
front door - which is at <A HREF="http://www.the-times.co.uk/">http://www.the-times.co.uk/</A>

Since it is not a breach of copyright to make short extracts from an article
which is in copyright, I quote:

The inclusion of the headlines of one newspaper in the internet website
of another newspaper was, prima facie, infringement of the copyright
belonging to the original newspaper.

Lord Hamilton, sitting in the Outer House of the Court of Session, so
held, granting interim interdict in an action of declarator of
infringement of copyright and interdict at the instance of *Shetland
Times Ltd* against Dr Jonathan Wills and another.

This was under Scottish Law, and I'm not sure what an "interim interdict"
is, but it sounds painful for the people who were doing the copying.

However it would seem that the judge was sympathetic to *The Shetland Times*
because:

A caller gaining access to the defendants' website might, by clicking on
one of those headlines appearing on the defenders' front page, gain
access to the text as published and reproduced by the pursuers.

Such access was gained without the caller requiring at any stage to gain
access to the pursuers' front page. Thus access to the pursuers' items
could be obtained by by-passing the pursuers' front page and accordingly
missing any advertising material which might appear on it.

This of course is pretty much what I'm guilty of, I guess, by giving you
the direct URL of the report in the Electronic Times! :-)

What isn't clear to me from the article is whether it would be a breach of
copyright to link to the articles without using the exact text of the
headlines.  [&lt;<A HREF="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ariadne/issue6/copyright/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ariadne/issue6/copyright/</A> &gt; has an

Lucky Green is right in <A HREF="/Risks/18.75.html">RISKS-18.75</A>.  Security fixes and virus-protection
software are now export-controlled.  Under the old ITAR, virus-protection
software was part of the list of *exempted* crypto software in
XIII(b)(1)(ix).  Even if it used crypto, it wasn't embargoed if the
software's purpose was protection against malicious code.

In the new EAR, such software is specifically included as export-controlled
under category 5D002 -- even if it doesn't include crypto!

It's now illegal to build worldwide products that are designed or modified
to protect against malicious computer damage.

This sounds like a manufacturer can't even fix bugs in their products if the
fix eliminates a security breach, since the fixed product is "modified to
protect against malicious computer damage".  This is not a joke.  Everybody,
it's time to call your lawyers...

It looks to me like the Information Warfare hawks have shot themselves in
the foot.  They were probably trying to prevent American products from
defending foreign countries against infrastructure attacks by the US
military.  Instead, as usual, they just leave our own infrastructure wide
open to attacks.

I encourage companies to comment to the Commerce Department about these new
regulations.  They are listening for comments by Feb 13th; see the web
reference below for details.  Don't expect your comments to change anything;
the NSA (which is pulling the strings here) seems to *want* the US to be
wide-open to both wiretapping and active attacks on computer-based
infrastructure.

The US FAA has issued a proposed airworthiness directive for Airbus A320/321
aircraft, that the elevator/aileron computers (ELACs) be replaced with
upgrades, to prevent uncommanded rolls during turbulence and with specific
flap configurations. This is based on field reports forwarded to the FAA by
the Direction Generale de l'Aviation, the French FAA equivalent. Apparently,
uncommanded rolls of up to 30\deg bank were experienced. It seems the
upgrades are software upgrades, as might be expected.

The FAA is quoted by Aviation Week (Jan 20, 1997, p40) as saying that there
are circumstances in which the sensitivity of the FBW design "creates safety
concerns". Examples of such include

* Air turbulence, with partial or full flaps set, can induce roll
oscillations;

* If full flaps are extended and subsequently jam, and partial flaps are then
selected, it becomes difficult for the flight crew to maintain the selected
flight path (this is surely a reference to the Dragonair incident of 6 June
1994 in Hong Kong - see Flight International, 18-24 January 1995, p40).

* When contaminants interfere with operation of the sidestick transducer
unit, transient signals from the sidestick to the ELACs may induce the
ailerons to `jerk' and induce an uncommanded roll, regardless of selected
autopilot mode or phase of flight.

The reference to autopilot modes is included because the ELACs are the
EFCS's interface to autopilot functions. The A320 Electrical Flight Control
System consists of seven major computers: two ELACs, three Spoiler and
Elevator Computers (SECs) and two Flight Augmentation Computers (FACs) (info
courtesy of Robert Dorsett and Peter Mellor).

This proposed Airworthiness Directive is one of only two public documents of
which I am aware which details problems with the A320 EFCS. The other is the
report of an incident at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport in August 1991 by
the (Australian) Bureau of Air Safety.  In this BAS report, some
user-interface anomalies with the sidestick controllers were noted. The
copilot had relinquished control to the captain on an emergency go-around,
had left his hand on the stick but was unaware of making any
inputs. Nevertheless, the DFDR recorded copilot inputs (both neutral and
nose-down pitch) for some 12 seconds. Excerpts from the report may be found
in `Computer-Related Incidents With Commercial Aircraft'
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de">http://www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de</A>&gt;.

I should include the usual caveats:

* Problems in control systems which are implemented by digital computers
are not necessarily problems properly to do with the computers. I would
guess that the first A320 problem above falls in this category. According
to the reports, so did the second accident to the Swedish Gripen aircraft
(see Fredriksson, <A HREF="/Risks/15.26.html">RISKS-15.26</A> and Shafer, 14.89; following Eriksson,
14.81; Thomas, 14.82; Everett, 14.85; Ladkin, 14.88; and Stalzer, 15.04),
and the X-31 accident (Ladkin, 16.89; Fuller, 17.45; Gomez, Fuller, 17.46;
Fuller, Ladkin, 17.47; Mellor, 17.60; Wright, 17.65)

* The fact that there are software upgrades does not automatically mean
that the software was in some sense `wrong'. Such hardware is,
loosely-speaking, general purpose, and one can make substantial control
system changes the `easy' way, by reprogramming. Compare this with the
time and expense of having to develop whole new actuators and integrate
them into the airframe, as Boeing is now doing with the B737 rudder
assembly (see `Computer-Related Incidents..'; also Aviation Week Jan 20
1997, p40; Flight International, 22-28 Jan 1997, p4).

Having said that, two of the remarked situations represent control anomalies
of a sort which may not occur with non-digital control systems.  The
Dragonair incident went unreported in RISKS.  The flight-control computers
responded to pilot inputs in a different mode from that in which the
aircraft was *in fact* configured. Crudely speaking, the computers `thought'
the aircraft was flying under partial flaps, whereas in fact the flaps were
full down. In the third situation, contaminants in the pilot controls cause
jerking of the control surfaces without feedback to the pilots. This is less
clearly a circumstance which arises only with digital flight controls: for
an example with conventional control systems, consider the B737 rudder
hard-overs (incidents have been verified, and both the two unexplained B737
accidents are suspected cases). However, in a conventional control system,
contaminants *at the pilot's end of the system* would normally result in
direct feedback to the pilots. One would also expect different types of
contaminants to cause problems (no, I'm not imagining that A320 sidesticks
are susceptible to cola and coffee....).  However, I suspect any case for
considering different types of contaminants to represent different failure
modes must rest on substantial differences in the type of contaminant and
whence it came.

One of my first 'big' projects for Mount Allison was a web interface to the
Student Information System to provide access for faculty &amp; students.  During
the design stage I tried to be very careful about access control and
possible attacks. In December, four months after the system was in place, a
student informed the HelpDesk that she wasn't receiving the correct
transcript information when she requested it. She was in fact getting
someone else's marks.

The source of the problem was quickly traced to the fact I had used the
'strstr' function when I should have written my own function to match the
complete username. The user 'mcl' was getting the transcript of 'bmcln'
instead because 'mcl' is a substring of 'bmcln'.

The second problem came when I 'fixed' it. I was not careful and provided a
fix with worked only for half of the cases. Finally, another student
reported having problems with getting the wrong transcript, and I fixed it
in all cases.

The risks here include; using a debugged prepackaged function when it isn't
appropriate. I knew the function's operation, I just didn't apply it
correctly to my program, writing a program without a set of test data to
search for mistakes. I only created test data to see that it 'worked', not
looking for mistakes. Finally when fixing a problem, I only tested the known
weakness, I did not look for other existing or new weaknesses.

I can see why the quality of software is considered so poor. Computer
Science and Programming courses do not stress testing and design
specifications enough. They focus on making a program that seem to work in
at least one test case. Certainly some courses do, but I completed an entire
university degree including computer science without having software testing
stressed in any of my courses. I am not talking formal validation, but
"stress tests" used in various other engineering fields.  Design
specifications? Professors often gave assignments which left several points
open to interpretation. Teaching by example? It is bad enough that most
books and instructors do not include examples which check to see if a
function failed, letting students assume 'malloc' always works.

OldRisks: Does publicizing the fact I had a system 'live' which had a serious
security flaw risk future jobs opportunities because of search tools such
as DejaNews? Or my poor spelling?

Macintosh users probably have less cause for concern about the year 2000
than any other computer users, thanks to Apple's farsighted programmers.
Originally, Macs stored the date as a 32-bit number representing the number
of seconds since January 1, 1904 - a scheme that wouldn't come unstuck until
February 2040.  But Apple's programmers decided that wasn't good enough, so
modern Macs use a signed 64-bit value that can cope with any date between
30081 BC and 29940 AD - more than enough for the time being.  [Excerpted
from Newsbytes, Connected, Electronic Telegraph, 21 Jan 1997]

A certain set of hospital accounting packages designed in 1967 and first

Dan Bernstein suggests keeping time in a 64-bit integer.  I prefer a
floating-point format -- a double-precision (64-bit) float number that
counts either the number of seconds or number of days before/after a given
"epoch" date.  The advantage of this format is that, while it's most
accurate in the neighborhood of the "epoch", it can represent dates roughly
covering the lifespan of the universe.

We have elected to discontinue the reverse lookup feature because of

However, this is not actually the case -- it's still there, just in a

Anders Andersson (Leaking WWW surfer interest profiles, <A HREF="/Risks/18.77.html">RISKS-18.77</A>)
observes the possibility that the ad.doubleclick.net site, from a firm that
sells space on a couple of dozen large web sites (*The New York Times*
advertising column, 20 Jan 1997), may be in a position to save keyword lists
submitted for search on the Alta-Vista search engine.

What Anders Andersson may not have noticed was that when the browser called
up the doubleclick site it returned more than an image; it also returned a
cookie that doubleclick retrieves on subsequent accesses to its affiliated
systems to develop a profile of Andersson's likes, dislikes, and usage
habits.  [See my item in <A HREF="/Risks/18.19.html">RISKS-18.19</A> for more on these stealthy cookies.]

Seems one without too much trouble could compile an incredibly detailed
profile of an individual given one's footprints through webspace, coupled
with one's search engine habits for those inconvenient times when the
footprints don't lead to doubleclick's sites.  A most valuable marketing
tool.

I have recently noticed that many of my most commonly asked web pages
(dilbert, altavista) regularly crash my graphical web browsers.  Upon
further investigation, I find that it is due to the advertisements inserted
in these popular pages, linked to ad.doubleclick.net.  (Presumably this is
used by the page owner to generate some revenue.)

The trouble is that the (apparently very redundant) web server used by
doubleclick occasionally serves up a GIF gratuitously, rather than
respecting the HTTP protocol. This seems to crash many versions of two
popular graphical browsers.

To compound the difficulty, doubleclick.net seems to have some difficulty
processing mail. E-mail sent to <A HREF="mailto:webmaster@doubleclick.net">webmaster@doubleclick.net</A> bounced, at any
rate, after several days.

The exact RISK is a little murky, but the electronic medium of the web, and
its enormous popularity, seems to have made it possible for one faulty
provider to seriously damage the medium.

&gt;  There's also no guarantee that a message sent out actually arrives [...]

Neither is there any "guarantee" that a message sent on paper via the postal
service will actually arrive at the correct destination or that you'll hear
about it if it doesn't.  We should be careful about our implicit
assumptions; here, the assumption seems to be that there's more of a
guarantee for paper mail ("P-mail") than for electronic mail ("E-mail").
I'm not convinced that's true.

How many times have you received P-mail that was addressed to someone else
but delivered to you because the postal service screwed up or the errant
mail was stuck to a piece of mail that was correctly delivered to you?  I
doubt there are many adults in the United States who have not experienced
both of these on multiple occasions.  To be sure, similar kinds of mistakes
happen with E-mail, but I've never seen any concrete evidence that they
happen more or less frequently than with P-mail.

(I have, on the other hand, seen anecdotal evidence that when the postal
service screws up, it often does so spectacularly.  For example, I recently
sent a first-class, certified, return-receipt-requested letter from Boston
to New York.  The postal service took 23 days to deliver the letter.  When I
inquired at the sending post office before delivery about the fate of my
letter, they seemed surprised that I was upset about the delay, and mostly
clueless about what could be done about it.

And let's not forget the articles we see occasionally in the newspaper about
letter carriers dumping trailers full of mail that they didn't feel like
delivering.)

One worthwhile distinction between P-mail and E-mail is that when P-mail is
misdelivered, the culprit is more likely to be the postal service than the
sender.  With misdelivered E-mail, on the other hand, the culprit is more
likely to be the sender (I'm not talking about failed delivery, which is
almost always cause by some sort of system failure; I'm talking about
delivery to the wrong person).  What this says to me is that people are less
careful about addressing E-mail than they are about addressing P-mail.

When I address a P-mail letter, I check the address, return address and
postage immediately after I put them on the envelope.  Then, I check them
again when I pick it up from the letter holder by my door to bring it to the
mailbox.  Then, I check them again before I put it in the mailbox.  How many
people are that careful about E-mail?

I take a somewhat callous attitude about misaddressed E-mail.  "If you send
E-mail to the wrong place, it's your own damn fault."  Many people disagree
and argue that it's the software's fault for not protecting the user from
making stupid mistakes, such as the cc:Mail E-mail address completion error
which was documented in another message in RISKS 18.77 as well as in
previous issues of RISKS.

I find that argument to be flawed.  People send far more E-mail than P-mail,
Any features we put in the software to make addressing errors less likely
will make it take more effort to send E-mail.  Users will say, "I don't want
it to be so hard to send E-mail," and they'll disable the features (or
become inured to them, e.g., always clicking "OK" to the "Are these
addressees correct?" dialog).  In fact, people have *demanded* the features
which make it easier to address E-mail and which therefore make it easier to
*mis*address E-mail.

Misaddressed E-mail is going to keep happening until baby HAL grows up and
we have computers that are smart enough to look at what a message says and
to whom it's addressed and say, "You know, I don't think you intended to
send that message where you told me to send it."  In the meantime, we should
all keep in mind the oft-repeated lunch-room-wall adage about E-mail.

I once made a very embarrassing mistake, shortly after an internal job move,
of sending a message (I thought) to my new boss, but in fact sending it to
the old one, because they had the same first name, and out of habit, having
typed "Alan", I went on to type the wrong surname.

I made this mistake without putting stuff in the wrong field, without any
inadvertent transposition, and without, even, any assistance from partial
name matching - it was all my own work.

And it got me thinking about how readily we try to slide away from the idea
that we should check we've got it right before we hit the *send* key.

A smooth riding, quiet car with a powerful engine makes it easy for
you to exceed the speed limit, but the judge will rightly point out
that you should have been more diligent in checking the speedometer.

Here is the problem that we are facing.  When you send a note to these users
and get a message back saying that the user does not exist, it looks like
two valid messages to us.  IBMMAIL is basically a store and forward system.
It provides for ANY to ANY seamless connections between mail systems.  All
of the SMTP mail IDs that you listed are actually SNADS IDs.  The first two
letters are the ISO country code that the user is from.  The rest of the
characters designate enterprise and user.  Our machines translate this
"Inter-Enterprise Address" (IEA) into a real userid and real node.  That is,
USFMC8LM is actually SSTARKEY at FORD.  You sent the SMTP note to
<A HREF="mailto:USFMC8LM@IBMMAIL.COM">USFMC8LM@IBMMAIL.COM</A>, which got to our Internet gateway and was translated
into USFMC8LM at IBMMAIL, which got to our IBMMAIL machines and was
translated into SSTARKEY at FORD.  Then there is no way for us to tell what
happened; this person could have left the company, changed userid or
anything that would have deleted SSTARKEY from the AS/400 node FORD.
MAILMAN is the userid on the FORD node that sent you back a note letting you
know that the userid SSTARKEY did not exist.  Our IBMMAIL machines received
a note from MAILMAN at FORD, the address was changed to USFMCSQC at IBMMAIL,
then it was sent to our Internet gateway and the address was changed to
<A HREF="mailto:USFMCSQC@IBMMAIL.COM">USFMCSQC@IBMMAIL.COM</A>.

As you can see from this lengthy explanation, IBMMAIL sees two messages
going back and forth.  Both of them are valid messages with no references to
any problems.  In this instance, there is really nothing that we could do.
You tried to do the right thing by sending a note to the postmaster, you
just had the wrong address.  The one that should have worked is
<A HREF="mailto:USFMCSQC@IBMMAIL.COM">USFMCSQC@IBMMAIL.COM</A>.  [Apparently it did not.  I tried it several times.
PGN] This is the address for the MAILMAN ID at the system that was
generating the error.

There is a <A HREF="mailto:POSTMASTER@IBMMAIL.COM">POSTMASTER@IBMMAIL.COM</A> userid.  It is monitored.  [Yes, as I
noted in <A HREF="/Risks/18.77.html">RISKS-18.77</A>, I also tried it several times.  PGN] We have searched
through the mail logs and could not find anything from your ID.  I know the
folks that monitor that ID.  They do their best, but I am sure that you can
imagine the kind of messages that we get.  For every valid message, like
yours, that we get we will get MANY that are bogus.  Everything from "I am
looking for my wife.  I think she works for IBM, can you find her for me" to
requests on how to get a job.  It is these kinds of notes that make the
POSTMASTER responses take so long.  I assume that this happens to pretty
much every service out there.  We do our best to provide an excellent
service, but we get thousands of these requests a week.  Maybe you could put
something about that in your newsletter.  Let folks know that if we are
spending too much time weeding through bogus messages, we don't have time to
investigate and correct the valid problems.  We are getting killed with vast
numbers of messages, while only a VERY small amount of them are actually
valid problems.

Now I will get off my soapbox and let you know what we have done.  If you
run into a problem where you send to an incorrect IBMMAIL address, like the
one in your note, or if an address is deleted, we will send you a note
letting you know what the error is and the SMTP address in question.  You
probably have many more IBMMAIL users than you think.  We also do HOST
ALIASING.  Our users have the option of changing their IEA address into a
more user friendly Internet-style address.  They can use their own domain of
a sub-domain of E-MAIL.COM.  And you will never know that the message is
coming from IBMMAIL unless you look through the header and trailer info.  We
will send out the same error message for these users also.  [...]

<DD>This is a wonderful service.  As a child, I had to deal with pet loss, my parents did most of the work.  Now, as an adult, I had no idea what they did.  When I lost my kitty Floyd, I wanted everyone to share in his memory.  The more people who know about him, the more his life is celebrated, and the more he knows how much I love and miss him.  Hopefully, he will think of me more, too! Thank you for providing this opportunity.  Each day I feel more comforted, and closer to Floyd than ever.  JZ<P>

<DD>In a world where so much evil exist.  People only interested in what may benefit them or their self centered thoughts.  It is indeed a pleasure to see where people such as yourself still exist.  Someone who is interested in families and friends being able to preserve the name or names of loved one's who have departed this world.  May God truly bless you!!<P>

<DD>We &quot;Thank You&quot; from our hearts for this memorial service.  Our cat &quot;Freeway&quot; died on January 16, 1997, it's been just 3 days and we miss him very much and it really helped that we were able to create our own &quot;special&quot; message for and about him.  God Bless  you in whatever you do.  Thom &amp; Sheila Hay<P>

<DD>This is a wonderful service.  As a child, I had to deal with pet loss, my parents did most of the work.  Now, as an adult, I had no idea what they did.  When I lost my kitty Floyd, I wanted everyone to share in his memory.  The more people who know about him, the more his life is celebrated, and the more he knows how much I love and miss him.  Hopefully, he will think of me more, too! Thank you for providing this opportunity.  Each day I feel more comforted, and closer to Floyd than ever.  JZ<P>

I've posted memorials to the three cats I've had in my life - Bashful, Gaverette, and Concertina - plus a memorial for all the animals who die to give us food and all the animals in laboratories - they feel pain just like our pets!<P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Zircon, an X11 Client for IRC </H1>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Release 1.18</I></H2>

You can configure lots of stuff using X resources, thus it is possible
to make buttons and text associated with particular users and channels
appear in special colours and fonts. The system is much easier to use
than the usual UNIX interfaces to irc and a lot of people are using it
on a day to day basis. Zircon also supports a distributed drawing
board, but please do not use this when there are non-Zircon users
around as they get annoyed when they cant see the pictures.

For people who really cannot do without their ircII style commands a
subset of these are also supported both in an optional command line
and from Channel windows - see the MANUAL for details.

INSTALLATION

These instructions are for Unix systesms. Zircon will run on Macintosh
and Windows machines - hwoever you will need to do a small amount
tweaking of the software. If you want to do this and perhaps can help
me set up proper distributions for these systems then get in touch.

1) Make sure you have tcl and tk installed.

2) Run the "installZircon" program - this is a tcl/tk program and it
   will look for a suitable interpreter using one of the usual names.
   if it cant find one then it will tell you.

3) A window will appear. Set the values to ones that are suitable for
   your system.

4) Now click "Install"

   You may find that you get compilation or link errors for the
   modules in Sed. This does not matter and will not affect the
   running of zircon. If you do get erros and can identify the cause
   please let me know.

5) The file Preferences shows you what you might want to put in your
   .zircon/preferences file in your HOME directory. But see the
   information about Multiple network support. Read the file
   README.prefs for information about what you can configure.

   You will also want to edit the file zircon.ad which can be found in
   the zircon library directory. This contains application defaults for
   X resources and is read by zircon on startup. 

   Zircon still supports the existence of a system wide preferences
   file, but this can cause problems and I would advise people not to
   use this feature. I will be working on it for the next version to
   make it work better with netspaces than it does at the moment - I
   appreciate that the feature is useful where many people are usign
   zircon on the same machine.

   WARNING: IN THE NEAR FUTURE I WILL BE PROVIDING A DIFFERENT WAY OF
   TAILORING ZIRCON'S APPEARANCE. ONE THAT WILL BE PORTABLE TO SYSTEMS
   OTHER THAN X-WINDOWS - BE PREPARED FOR THIS CHANGE!!!!

6) Off you go. Have fun!

Also included is a littel program that will help you fins the "Meta"
key that tcl/tk uses. This is called findMeta - run it and do what it
says if you don't know which is your Meta modifier.

HELP
----

Mail problems to zircon@catless.ncl.ac.uk. The zircon mailing list can
be joined by posting to zircon-request@newcastle.ac.uk and posted to
at zircon@newcastle.ac.uk You can usually find help in the #zircon
channel on IRC as well.
<P>Zircon is an X Window System interface to Internet Relay Chat. The software is written
in <A HREF="http://www.sunlabs.com/research/tcl/">tcl/tk</A> and uses the
native network communications of tcl. Suggestions for improvements to Zircon
are welcome. I am particularly interested in making the system useful for
those users in groups where JIPS and other national character sets are
used. </P>
<P>Zircon has more features than you could possibly imagine and implements
nearly everything that the irc II clients support as well as many other
useful and interesting features. This reflects the power of tcl/tk <I>not</I>
the fact that I am a wonderful programmer (I am, but that is a side issue
:-)) tcl/tk is a wonderful system and you need it on your machine <B>NOW</B>.

<H2>Known Features</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Zircon does not work with pre-2.8 servers. </LI>

<LI>There is no JIS support. This needs a kanjified tcl/tk and some changes
to zircon. Someone in Japan used to provide support for this but sems no
longer to do so.</LI>

<LI>Character escaping in the low level CTCP protocol is not done everywhere,
but it *is* done for SED encrypted messages </LI>

<LI>You cannot configure anything other than Channels using the configuration
panel. If you wish to configure Message channels then you have to do them
by hand in the rc file. One day I will completely redo the configuration
system....</LI>

<LI>The Sketch Pad facility is (still!!) not completely finished. (and
will probably move out into the plugin system when I get that done)</LI>

<LI>The Clear button does not clear the screen. This is a tcl/tk problem
and I cannot do anything (useful) to solve it. If you Shift-click on the
button then the screen and the history are cleared - this does work.</LI>

Until such time as either the general population learns what to expect or
digital authentication (such as PEM) becomes widespread, I suspect we will
hear more of this kind of incident. This academic year the University of
Wisconsin started providing e-mail accounts to all students at its Madison
campus. (6,000?, maybe) The students, both technical and non-technical, are
being encouraged to use e-mail as a way of interacting with their instructors.
They access the accounts either through University-supplied machines scattered
throughout the campus or through dial-up Serial Link Protocol (SLIP)
connections. A mix of Macintosh's, PC's and other assorted workstations are
involved.

Last week (note how early in the school year) a group of five students,
several from the Honors floor of one of the freshman dorms, were caught having
forged several pieces of e-mail. Most potentially damaging was a note saying
it was from the Director of Housing, to the Chancellor of the University,
David Ward; note that the previous Chancellor is now Pres.  Clinton's
Secretary of HHS, so the present Chancellor is new to the job.  The forged
message was a submission of resignation. Ward's secretary had just returned
from vacation and apparently assumed the proferred resignation was legitimate.
The secretary accepted it and started to act upon it -- it was only during the
course of that that it was discovered to be a fake.

The students also sent messages purporting to be from the Chancellor to 
other students asking them to pay their tuition. They also forged a message 
from the Chancellor (my information doesn't say who it went to) saying he 
was going to "come out of the closet" and announce it Sept. 25. 

The students were only caught through a combination of circumstances.  First,
since they used one of the dial-in connections there were logs of who dialed
in when. Secondly, during the course of their experiments they botched some
addresses which caused enough traffic to go to the dead-letter office that the
investigation could narrow what was happening. (It should be pointed out that
the forgery was fairly easy to accomplish using the Eudora mail client on a
Macintosh: the user has complete choice over the "from:" field of a message.)

The FBI is investigating whether any federal crime was involved and, 
needless-to-say, the students are likely to be expelled at the least.

The market report in the London Evening Standard of 17th September 1993
reported:
         
  ...With so many people away from their desks for Yom Kippur there was little
  inspiration but dealers were startled to see the price of P&amp;O race up from
  653p to 863p, triggering thoughts of a dawn raid.  The price then 
  disappeared from screens and it was put down to a computer error.  The real
  price was 603p, up 2p.

     [Someone was playing the P&amp;O blindfolded.  Perhaps what was needed was
     a Yom Kippured Herring Aide who could hear "2p on Travel".  PGN]

Computers Paid Bills as Woman in Sweden Lay Dead for 3 Years

Stockholm -- The body of an elderly woman who died in 1990 lay undiscovered in
her apartment for more than three years while computers received her pension
and automatically paid her bills, Swedish police said Saturday.  "It's very
unusual for someone to be dead so long without anyone else reacting," a police
duty officer in the Stockholm suburb of Farsta told the national news agency
TT.

The woman's last-opened mail was dated May 11, 1990, police said, indicating
she had died at the age of 72.  Her name has not been made public.  Police
were called to break into the apartment by its landlord after he had made
repeated efforts to gain the occupant's permission to renovate it.

In the Globe and Mail newspaper from Canada for Saturday, Sept 11, 1993, Mary
Gooderham, Applied Science Reporter, has an article on page A3 entitled,
"Technology points finger at poor drivers: Car rentals could become more
difficult as motorists' records are shared."

The article explains that for $5, the Ontario Transportation Ministry will
provide any registered driver's record (including name, license number,
date of birth, sex, conviction--criminal and highway--and accident history.
Such information is supposedly restricted to "authorized requesters" including
police, collection agencies and insurance companies.

In contrast, the province of British Columbia will being in October 93 to
require written permission from data subjects before releasing their accident
records.

Gooderham writes that some US rent-a-car agencies routinely check the driving
record of applicants from NY, MD, FL and OH.  Poor drivers are refused
service.

In Canada, the Interprovincial Record Exchange is managed by the Canadian
Council of Motor Transport Administrators, which is considering "giving third
parties access." In NY, TML Information Services serves as broker between the
State and rental-car agencies.  According to Gooderham, TML's CEO, Sean
Doherty, expects "half of U.S. drivers will be covered by the system by the
middle of next year."

+ + + 

The prospect of reducing road accidents and thefts by keeping track of rotten
drivers and no-goodniks appeals to my orderly side.  However, in the light of
extensive discussions in RISKS-14 about faulty credit, driving, and criminal
records, the lack of clear information or procedures for _checking_ and
_correcting_ such records is a problem.  How would you, a model citizen and
driver, like to discover on the morning of your vacation/business/emergency
trip that you appear to have been disqualified by an erroneous database
record?  Arguing with the poor soul on the other side of the counter will
clearly not help.  I expect to see a growing number of lawsuits as a result of
database errors or possibly even program bugs when innocent people suffer from
data corruption.

It will not be good enough to allow just _anyone_ to make ostensible
corrections in our records, either. Some method of identification and 
authentication will have to be devised to prevent nasty people from damaging
other people's histories.

And just what, pray, will that entail?  A national identification card? Perhaps
we are headed that way.  The social security number is already becoming an
equivalent that can tie together many independent databases to provide a
detailed vision of an individual's personal and professional life.

Without adequate provisions for maintaining data integrity and validity, the
growing use of databanks containing personal information will result in costly
and perhaps dangerous errors.

As a followup to the article on drivers' records I just posted, I would like to
explore the consequences of having many interlinked but independently-managed
databanks describing us.  These problems have been familiar to data processing
personnel for the last 50 years, but they will be new to some of the
designers, administrators and users of interlinked personal-information
databases being established throughout government and industry.  

Agency A maintains a databank and links in to Organization B, which links up
with Institution C.  Data flow from A -&gt; B -&gt; C.  An error creeps into the
record for Percy Perfect in database A.  It propagates to B and C.  

Percy discovers the problem one morning when he lands at Seattle Airport and
tries to pick up his Superior Rent-A-Car vehicle so he can make a 10 am
meeting 120 miles away in the back woods of Washington state.  He is refused
because his record now shows that he stole a car in Florida 3 years ago.
Actually, Percy has never stolen as much a jellybean in his life and has never
been to Florida.  It's one of those identity-mixups.  Oops, sorry, we'll fix
it.

Three weeks later, the correction finally makes it into database A.

Question:  is there a mechanism in place to record the fact that the record had
in the past been sent to database B?  And will B also "know" that it ought to
send a correction to database C?

If all works well, there is no problem.

But what if C doesn't "know" that B got data from A.  What if A, not "knowing"
that C got some of _its_ data from B, signs an agreement to begin sharing data
FROM C?  Then we have A -&gt; B-&gt; C -&gt; A: a circular data path.  

As soon as there is a loop in the topology, the loop may inadvertently become
an accumulator or buffer.  So A send a correction to B which propagates it to
C, but unfortunately just moments before the correction arrives, C ships an
update to A showing the erroneous data.  Will A update its own new records
with an old record that is in fact wrong?  Yes it will, unless provisions are
implemented to forestall such problems.

Some of the techniques that will have to be evaluated include

     o    time stamps using coordinated time to allow a system to establish
          which of two records is newer.

     o    a standardized format for exchanging the _history_ of a record:  
          where did it come from?  when?

     o    mechanisms for unique identification of a database.

     o    mechanisms for alerting member databases to circular references.
     
     o    provision for authentication of updates; perhaps message 
          authentication codes in the style of ANSI X9.9, including a sequence 
          number in the MAC to prevent insertion and deletion of transactions.

A printout of the data subject's record should be delivered to the data
subject on demand when and where the information is used.  In addition, as a
means of catching errors fast, it would help if a printout were delivered to
the data subject every time the record is modified.  These practises would not
prevent or identify all problems (e.g., they'd fail when the address is wrong)
but at least they'd be on the right path.

The Internet contains files which co-exist in different repositories without
too much conflict.  Let us hope that this model of collaborative data storage
will serve as an example of how to accommodate redundant data without
bureaucratic and governmental meddling.

After testing a computer-based training program last night, on a PC, it was 
time to quit.  The program used a GUI-ish interface, one of those home-
grown interfaces that appeared on the PC before Windows became established.

So, I selected quit, saw the prompt, and hit "no."  Automatically.  Then 
returned to the main menu.  Did this three times, very fast, figuring I 
missed the button.  Finally, my host said, "Try clicking on yes."

The prompt?  "Do you want to quit?"  Yes/No.

But *I*, a Mac-user, have been conditioned to see: "Save changes before
quitting?"  Yes/No/Cancel.  This is the only time you see "are you sure"
prompts on exiting a Mac program.  I was just screwing around, so of COURSE
I hit "No."

I'm sure there's a RISK in there, somewhere...:-)  It was COMPLETELY 
instinctive for me to hit "No"...


And while I'm at it, an old vending-machine story, which someone suggested
I send to RISKS at the time.  This was one of those machines with an alpha
A-F "category" selector, with a numeric item selector.  So if you wanted the
fifth item on row C, it would be C-5.  After entering the proper amount,
one hit the button "C", then the button "5."  

Except in this case, the item was C-11.  What did I, techno-nerd, do?  
"C-1-1."  Twice.  Getting the item C-1.  Then I looked down, and saw that
the numeric selectors went down to 12, including 10, 11, and 12.  Oh.


In this vein, airliner avionics requiring numerical entry tend to use 
"phone-style" keyboards, with 123 the top row of keys.  Yet all calculators 
are exactly the opposite, with 123 the second-to-bottom row.  What happens 
when cultures clash, in THAT case? :-)  Or the 0 key is transposed from
the left bottom-most key, to the right?  Or put to the left of the 1?  :-)


Profound questions at 5AM....

Michel E. Kabay was wondering about the risks of new digital phones on
microprocessors.  I don't know about this but I do know that using certain
types of portable phone near certain types of fire detectors can set off a
false alarm.

The problem was caused by portable phones causing an ionization detector
to send out a signal which was interpreted by the system as a genuine detect.
The problem came to light when the customer used a portable phone to complain
about the late arrival of the engineer, needless to say he was sat right under
one of the detectors.

&gt; Details of the errors were disclosed after a clinical inquiry by senior

&gt; radiation doses of up to 35% less than prescribed. Their report blamed
&gt; human error by Margaret Grieveson, a physicist, who unnecessarily
&gt; programmed a correction factor into the radiography computer in 1982."

The inquiry has indeed blamed Dr Grieveson, but from the news reports it is
not totally clear to me that this is fair - there are some unanswered
questions.

The nature of the error is that she manually instructed the new computer
controlling the X-ray to apply a standard correction factor (as had been
required previously) based upon the distance of the radiation source from the
patient.  Unknown to her, however, the computer program already had this
correction coded into it, so that in essence it was being applied twice.

It's the 'unknown to her' that bothers me, and that the reports have not
addressed.  Does this imply that she didn't bother to RTFM, or is it the case
that the manufacturers of the equipment thought it so obvious that the program
would include the correction, that they didn't bother to mention it?  I'd
really like to know.

Whichever is the case, it clearly demonstrates the risk of changing
methodologies without making absolutely certain that everyone fully
understands the new methods, and how they compare to the old ones.

Finally, if the board of inquiry is able to determine, merely by reference to
the set of records which were routinely kept, that patients were consistently
being underdosed, then it feels probable that a review of the case papers in
each individual case, while treatment was going on, could have revealed the
same thing.  Does this also demonstrate the risks involved in changing
procedures without creating a mechanism for monitoring the effects of the
change?

&gt; The interesting part is that for the first time we are approaching the point 
&gt; where true separation is possible. Not in a mainframe, nor in a UNIX machine
&gt; but in the client-server network (not peer-peer though).

&gt; IMHO this changed world-view is going to cause the single greatest change in
&gt; information security that we have ever seen. Networks will cease being
&gt; "unsecurable" and become the only accepted means for protection of data.

I hope you're right, Padgett, but we've got a LONG way to go. It's amazing how
many network users are unaware of the ease with which packets can be
monitored, copied, and replayed. Every time I present my lecture on
public-domain software tools to monitor LAN segments, most of the audience is
shell-shocked!

I read a fax of a photocopy of a newspaper article (sigh), which unfortunately
had the name of the newspaper as well as the date and author of the article
are obscured.  Although I am confident this is authentic, please keep this
source in mind.

	"This is the new field of what [...] calls
	`electronic voyeurism'.  	[...]
	The results of electronic peeping are as
	troubling as they are bizarre.
	Supervisors with no intent to do mischief
	may watch employee message traffic on computer systems.
	That kind of surveillance led a major California
	financial institution, the Bank of America,
	to fire an employee after his electronic mail
	indicated that, when his day job ended,
	he worked nights as a professional gay stripper."

(1) Can anyone out there supply more factual details about this case?
    It must have hit the papers in California.

(2) We are left with a legal morass ...

    (a) At least in Canada, public and private institutions do have the
    right to monitor "private communications", but only if their intent
    is to check the performance and security of the systems
    that they are responsibile for maintaining.  By the way, one might
    argue that the date, time, volume, originator, recipient
    of communications should be sufficient for this purpose, making
    perusal of the contents, under the guise of checking performance
    or security, questionable.

    [caveat: the absence of a "reasonable expectation of privacy"
    makes listening much easier, as in cellular phones, or
    product support phone calls to an employee in the service dept
    of a company -- these issues are orthogonal to the following...]

    (b) Privacy laws protect personal communication.

    (c) Some Universities have rules of the following nature:
    
	(i)  it is against policy to read another person's
	     files or e-mail.

	(ii) a person's personal files and e-mail *are* admissible
	     as evidence against an accused person.

	One might imagine that (ii) is ineffective because
	while it says personal files and e-mail can be used, (i) says
	no one can ever obtain them!  Implicit in the presence of (ii),
	however, is the notion that if such personal information
	*magically* appears at the pubic printer and is handed to
	someone evaluating the accused, then ... so be it.

	A motivated technical person could even conveniently
	"suspect" a problem with the computer or communications system,
	totally eviscerating the privacy rule, by appealing to (a).

I just did an experiment sending massive quantities of e-mail to a typical
Unix box, and of course, I was able to overrun the disk capacity on the
recipient machine, thus making the system grind to a crunching halt for lack
of space.  Since I sent it to daemon, nobody noticed the mail for quite some
time, and it took a bit before they figured out the problem and were able to
fix it.

I don't know for sure, but I think a lot of systems are susceptible to this
attack, and there is no easy solution, at least if you still want to get mail.

To assess the degree to which this might be a threat, I got a listing of DoD
and US Government sites from the Chaos Computer Club (thank you Charles) and
tried sending mail to them - only 1 refused the mail out of 67 tried.  Several
told me there was no such mail recipient, but gave me a directory of other
recipients with simnilar names - how helpful.  A few told me they didn't have
sucha user and identified that they were a particular type of system - now I
know for certain what UID to send to.

	Under some versions of Unix, you can put quotas on users, but not on
e-mail space - as far as I know.  The ULIMIT prevents unbounded growth, but it
is now set high enough by default on most systems that it won't stop this
attack.  You can explicitly refuse mail on some systems, but I don't think
there is a general way to do this selectively enough to defend against this
attack.  The default is almost always to get all that comes to you.  Your
suggestions are welcomed - FC

My company is involved with a client that is producing a device that will
be used in open heart surgery.  Our responsibility is the design and
implementation of the electronics and software that will control this device.

Our client is pushing to increase the staff size 2 to 3 times beyond the
number of individuals actually required to do the work.  Our contention is
that "too many cooks spoil the broth", an oversized staff is less likely to
produce a high quality, safe product.

Does anyone in these news groups have information on acedemic or industry
references relating to this subject, pro or con?  FDA or military project
histories would be especially useful.

Thanks for the help.  Mike Willey
