Eileen began her career in publishing on a weekly newspaper in Philadelphia,
Pa. Over the course of seven years, she went from part-time proofreader
to full-time editor, serving along the way as typesetter, copy editor, reporter
and graphic designer as well. During her last two years with the company,
the paper switched to a Macintosh desktop publishing system, and Eileen
discovered her true calling in layout and graphic design. She left the newspaper
in 1991, and spent the next two years honing her computer skills while working
for the MacTemps and MacSpecialists agencies, as well as on a variety of
design and writing projects in Philadephia and New York. <BR>
One of those projects brought her to Chilton in March 1993, when she was
hired on a freelance basis as production editor for the Motor Age Technical
Training Series and ASE Self-Study Guides. Two months later, the part-time,
freelance project became a full-time job, and she joined the staff of Motor
Age and ABRN as combination production editor/proofreader/copy editor and
general Mac computer troubleshooter. In 1994, Eileen began working exclusively
for ABRN, while still handling the Self-Study Guides and Technical Training
Series books. Today, she is responsible for the layout and production of
ABRN's regular monthly departments and Products section, including the four-color
Product sections which appear quarterly.  Her experience with autos consists
mostly of watching them being towed away. <BR>

A recent article in one of the business newspapers described the top ten
investment opportunities for entrepreneurs looking to start their own business.
According to the experts, one of the best prospects was an automotive service
shop. This is not surprising for a number of reasons. Vehicles are becoming
more electronic and require more expensive diagnostic tools for successful
troubleshooting. Consumers are intimidated by automotive technology and
doing less DIY repairs. Our society is aging, and baby boomers are more
inclined to pay someone else to maintain and service the family chariot.
And, while the vehicle fleet is growing in both numbers and service life,
with average vehicle age creeping toward the 10+ year mark, the car manufacturers
are reducing the number of dealer outlets, further limiting the available
service bays and leaving more market share for the independents to claim.<P>
In short, the future of automotive service in this country looks bright.
That's not to say there aren't significant challenges to those who choose
a career in the automotive service industry. The rapid expansion of automotive
electronics into almost every system of the automobile has had a dramatic
impact on the way cars and trucks are built and maintained. Add to this
concerns over finding enough qualified technicians to meet industry needs,
the ongoing struggle to obtain the service information necessary to diagnose
and repair modern vehicle systems, and the never-ending pressure from environmental
legislation, and you have a situation that requires repair shop owners and
managers to be sharp businessmen and women, as well as sharp technicians.<P>
This presentation takes a look at the automotive service industry. We'll
examine where we are and where we're going. We'll talk about the forces
shaping out future and look down the road at some of the new vehicle designs
headed our way. We'll begin with a look at the latest automotive technology,
both in and out of the service bay.<P>
Electronics as applied under the hood and inside the vehicle has changed
service technology and its performance in many significant ways. This growth
in automotive electronics has not only changed the vehicle, it has significantly
altered the technicial requirements of the individuals who service this
new breed of personal transportation. It has also caused a quantum leap
in the amount of service information technicians require to do their job
effectively. <BR>

<B>Growth in Electronics</B></CENTER>
<P>This slide shows the growth of vehicle electronic systems over the last
ten years. Note that by the year 2000, virtually every new vehicle will
be equipped with some form of ABS, distributorless ignition and advanced
diagnostics. The growth of OBD2 across both import and domestic vehicle
lines will allow diagnostic equipment manufacturers to produce tools which
will have a wider application than before. For the shop owner, this means
more bang for the diagnostic buck and more closely resembles the real-world
way vehicles are serviced, with most facilities working on both import and
domestic cars and light trucks.<BR>

<B>Cadillac Catera</B></CENTER>
<P>For the most part, manufacturers designing this highly capable service
equipment are faced with automotive systems that may be sourced literally
from around the world. As a result, most new diagnostic equipment is being
designed to work on as many types of vehicles as possible. The world car
is already here, and many Americans are driving them even as we speak. In
fact, two words which are becoming more meaningless every day are IMPORT
and DOMESTIC. The reason is simple: vehicle manufacturers are using more
outside sources than ever before, and those suppliers are being encouraged
to supply complete systems that can be easily installed on the assembly
line. Add to that the influence European and Asian designers are having
on American carmakers and you come up with things like this Cadillac Catera,
new for 1997.<BR>

Interesting, to say the least, as the latest crop of concept vehicles points

<B>Eagle Jazz</B></CENTER>
<P>Since we're on the retro theme, now would be a good time to take a look
at what the folks at Chrysler have in mind for the future. Some of it is
quite stunning. We'll start with the Eagle Jazz.<BR>
The Eagle Jazz concept vehicle debuted to the public at the 1995 Detroit
Auto Show. It's design reflects the Chrysler cab-forward philosophy which
dominates their existing and proposed product lineup with one or two notable
exceptions, which I'll get to in a moment. The Jazz uses an efficient 2.5L,
24-valve, overhead cam V6. The front double wishbone suspension and independent
rear multilink designs are conventional by today's standards. One interesting
note is the use of oversize wheel wells to allow for the 18 inch wheels
and tires. Rear passengers are well entertained by the built-in combination
video/CD player, and kept comfortable with their own set of climate controls.
The most striking design feature is the extensive use of flush glass and
a rear window treatment that slopes below the spoiler.<BR>

<P>Remember those mini sport utility vehicles I said everyone was developing.
Here's Plymouth's offering, called the Back Pack. Described as part utility,
part sporty coupe and part pickup truck, this niche vehicle was created
by Chrysler's Pacifica Advanced Design Studio and was first introduced at
the 1995 Detroit Auto Show. <BR>

<B>Chrysler Atlantic </B></CENTER>
<P>This is the Chrysler Atlantic, and it's what Chrysler designers think
two-door luxury performance was meant to be. The retro styling is reminiscent
of Bugatti or Jaguar designs, although Chrysler refers to the spirit of
luxury French coachbuilders of the late 1930's in its description of the
car. Make no mistake about it, this vehicle is a statement and designed
to be as artistic as it is functional.<BR>

<B>Plymouth Prowler </B></CENTER>
<P>This vehicle is the one that's going to keep Chrysler in the buff magazines
for years. It's the Plymouth Prowler, and yes, it's a real car. Due for
release as a 1997 model, the Prowler began life as a concept vehicle. Talk
about retro, the Prowler is designed to bring back the hot rod culture as
uniquely American as baseball and Hollywood. <BR>

<B>Ford Indigo</B></CENTER>
<P>A few years back, Ford introduced a flock of concept vehicles which pioneered
everything from new aluminum manufacturing concepts and the first transverse
straight eight engine design ever seen. While somewhat focused on engine
developments these days, a couple of unique designs show the direction that
company is taking in preparing for the next century.<P>
This is the Ford Indigo, a two-seat, V12-powered concept sports car that
obviously draws its inspiration from IndyCar racing. This vehicle is unique
in that it uses materials, construction techniques, chassis design and aerodynamics
from Ford's Indy experience. The result is a somewhat radical, high-performance
street machine that should give insurance underwriters fits.<BR>

<B>Ford Synergy 2010 </B></CENTER>
<P>The Ford Synergy 2010 is a concept vehicle which was created to explore
technological frontiers of what the typical family car might be in the year
2010. The Synergy incorporates advanced technology which evolved from the
space and defense programs, as well as some design cues borrowed from race
cars.<P>
A hybrid vehicle, generally defined, is a vehicle that uses two power sources,
usually an internal combustion or gas turbine engine or fuel cell, and a
second power source, such as a flywheel or battery. In the case of the Synergy,
a small (one liter) compression-ignition (diesel) engine is mounted in the
rear and powers a generator that produces electricity for motors located
at each wheel. Up front, a flywheel collects excess engine and braking energy,
which is in turn released to augment the engine when the car is accelerating
or climbing a grade.<P>
Unlike many of the other concepts, the Synergy 2010 is not buildable at
this time. It still requires extensive research on many of the design and
technology concepts, not to mention some safety questions if one of the
wheel motors fails, but it's a good indicator of the direction Ford is heading
for the future.<BR>

<B>Alternate Fuels 
<P></B>One of the biggest changes to the automotive industry is the move
toward the use of alternate fuels. These days, we're seeing vehicles powered
by propane, natural gas and electricity driving the streets right now. Although
the use of these alternate fuels is largely restricted to fleets because
of the lack of a fueling infrastructure, the puzzling choice our friend
here has to make could be a reality at service stations at some time in
the future. To be sure, we're already widely using alternate fuels in the
form of oxygenated gasoline and methanol, but carmakers both here and abroad
have plans to produce the kinds of vehicles which will make things like
alternate fuels and hybrid technology a commonplace reality in the service
bays of the next century.<BR>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>VOC Calculations, Reporting and Record Keeping</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><P><CENTER><A HREF="../index.htm"><IMG SRC="../IMAGES/abrntop.gif" WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="79" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom></A><A NAME="anchor328679"></A><P></CENTER><H3>From March 1996 ABRN:</H3><H2><CENTER>VOC Calculations, Reporting and Record Keeping</CENTER></H2><H3><CENTER>By Dr. Kenneth E. Hine<P>Special to ABRN</CENTER></H3><P>Are you ready for regulations on refinish paint? Many states have introducedVolatile Organic Compound (VOC) legislation over the last year, and shopsin these states have already had to come to grips with this tricky subject.With the anticipated introduction of a National VOC Rule in November 1996,the rest of the U.S. will soon have to do the same.<P>The purpose of this article is to explain some of the basic ideas behindVOCs, and some of the calculations and math that go along with them. Youdo not need to understand all of this to be able to comply with the law,but knowing some of the background should help make more sense of the rules.To comply with the law, shops need to use the correct products accordingto manufacturers' instructions, use the equipment specified for the area,and record certain information about the paint used.<P>As you probably know by now, VOC regulations exist because of air pollution.The paint and solvent vapors which go up your ventilator exhaust or outof your spraybooth end up in the air we breathe, along with all the trafficfumes, smokestack emissions and furnace exhaust from everywhere else. Sunlight&quot;cooks&quot; this mixture into the grey, brown or yellow haze thatwe know as smog. Anyone who has lived in a large North American city knowshow bad city smog can be at times. Even at much lower pollution levels,smog can cause lung disease, and damage trees and farm crops. The FederalClean Air Act was amended in 1990 to set standards for air quality improvementand make air pollution reduction a priority. All the recently-introducedVOC regulations follow from this piece of legislation. <H3>A Few Basic Concepts</H3>As stated above, &quot;VOC&quot; stands for &quot;volatile organic compound.&quot;Regulators and paint chemists may split hairs over exactly what is and isn'tlegally a VOC, but for practical purposes VOC means &quot;solvent.&quot;The VOC content of a coating is high when the solvent content is high, andthe solids content is low. So lacquers have high VOC content, and high solids2-packs have lower VOC content.<P>Thinners and reducers are usually 100 percent VOC. Low VOC reducers do exist,and they come in two types: those with a low density (fewer pounds per gallon),and those which have a percentage of reactive material in them which endsup as part of the film and is not emitted as VOC (reactive reducers). Ineither case, it is important to use them only as recommended.<P>Two types of VOC content data are quoted by manufacturers. They are VOCcontent &quot;as-supplied&quot; and &quot;as-applied.&quot; Be careful whenreading supplier data that you know which is which. As-supplied means thepaint in the package. As-applied means the paint ready for use. The VOCcontent limits in state regulations always refer to VOC content as-applied- i.e., the VOC of the paint in the gun cup.<P>This means it is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions whenmaking up paint. If you do not follow the manufacturer's mixing instructions,you will not end up with the correct VOC content. Do not over-thin the paint.Thinner is 100 percent VOC, so adding extra thinner raises the VOC contentof the paint at the gun. An inspector who thinks that a shop is abusingproduct (e.g., over-thinning) is empowered to take paint samples for testing,including samples right out of a gun cup. (If the product does not spraywell at the recommended mix ratio, take it up with the paint manufacturer.)<H3>VOC Units</H3>&quot;VOC content&quot; is the weight of VOC (solvent) contained in a volumeof the ready-to-spray coating. Two types of units are used: pounds of VOCper gallon of coating (lb/gal), or grams of VOC per liter of coating (g/l).These are different ways of expressing the same thing, and you can convertfrom one to the other:<P>&#183; To convert from lb/gal to g/l, multiply by 119.8.<P>&#183; To convert from g/l to lb/gal, divide by 119.8.<P>So a VOC content of 5.0 lb/gal is the same as 5 x 119.8 = 599 g/l. <H3>Waterborne Coatings</H3>If the coating contains water, things become more complicated. The fulldefinition of VOC content is &quot;pounds of VOC per gallon of coating-minus-water.&quot;This means, for instance, if a gallon of coating contains half a gallonof water and 1 lb. of solvent, the VOC content is not 1 lb. per gallon but1 lb. per gallon minus a half gallon of water-i.e., 1 lb. per half gallonor 2 lb. per gal.<P>This calculation looks very strange at first, but there is a good reasonfor it. It means that adding water to a paint does not change the VOC content.If it did, you could, in theory, take a high VOC product and add water untilthe VOC content was low enough to meet the limit. This &quot;watered down&quot;paint would have a lower VOC content, but you would need to use much moreof it to paint a given area. For instance, if you added a gallon of waterto each gallon of paint, the VOC content would be halved, but you woulduse twice as much to paint a job as before. The overall solvent emissionswould be exactly the same as if you had not added the water. CalculatingVOC content of coating minus water avoids this problem (but sometimes givesformulators a headache). <H3>VOC Record Keeping</H3>Most of the existing state VOC regulations require some type of recordsto be kept. In some areas, such as California, these records are requiredto be quite detailed.<P>The draft national VOC rule, as currently written, does not require shopsto keep any specific form of records (there are obligations on paint manufacturersinstead). However, state inspectors will require some type of record keeping:after all, how else can a shop prove that they are doing what the rulesrequire? At the simplest level, this may mean just having a paint supplier'sproduct wall chart and a list of the products used in the shop. However,some states, such as Indiana and large areas of California, require job-by-jobrecords of all paint used. Be aware of particular requirements for yourarea.<P>You might also think about the effect that organized-looking VOC recordswill have on an inspector. A neat VOC record file must give a better impressionthan a pile of dog-eared papers or a blank look.<P>What should records consist of? This depends on where you are. Please noteagain that you must refer to your local regulations for the final answeron what is required. There are lots of local variations, and a magazinearticle is not legal advice. Basically, there are four levels of recordkeeping which might be required:<P><BR>1. Basic: proof of compliance - This is the minimum that every regulatedshop should do. The purpose is to show that only compliant products areused in the shop, and that they are used correctly. Records should consistof:<P>&#183; Supplier VOC information, such as a wall chart or product data sheets,showing that the products are compliant.<P>&#183; A list of the products used in the shop<P>&#183; (Preferably) Purchase records showing that only compliant productsare being purchased for use in the shop.<P>2. Intermediate: proof of compliance plus paint purchase or usage volumes- Some states already require shops to report how much paint they buy oruse. This shows the approximate size of the shop, and how much VOC is beingemitted from the shop. Records required are:<P>&#183; Same as above, plus the following<P>&#183; The amount of paint purchased in each product category (primer, topcoat,etc.) in the previous month.<P>&#183; Or, the amount of paint used in each product category in the previousmonth. <P>Some states require this information to be recorded weekly. Some requirerecords to be sent in to the state air quality office on a yearly basis.All require that the records be kept for a long time, at least two yearsand sometimes up to five years.<P>Your PBE jobber may be able to help with your paint purchase figures. Somejobbers can provide a monthly summary of what you bought (which is goodbusiness information to have in any case). Ask.<P>3. Advanced: job-by-job records - This is required in parts of Californiaand the regulated counties of Indiana. For each vehicle repaired, you mustrecord the type and quantity of all coatings used, and the VOC content ofeach coating. Special forms are usually provided. Computer tracking makesrecord keeping of this type much simpler.<P>4. Special Case: total VOC emissions - A few shops need to calculate totalannual VOC emissions. This may be because of an operating permit restriction(for example, if emissions are restricted to a maximum number of tons peryear). Typically, only very large shops are required to do this and onlyin a few regions. In the Los Angeles area of California, some larger shopsalso required to track total emissions under the RECLAIM program.<P><BR>If you need to calculate emissions accurately, a computer tracking systemis the easiest way to go. VOC emissions can be calculated manually fromaccurate purchase or usage records and supplier VOC content information.Multiply the number of gallons of each product sprayed by the VOC contentin lb/gal to get the number of pounds of VOC emitted. The paint which goesto waste or is recycled can be excluded from the total (if you know thequantity), because it is never sprayed, so those VOCs are not emitted fromthe shop. <H3>In Summary</H3>National regulation of refinish coatings is coming in late 1996. Be awarethat compliant products are only compliant if mixed and thinned accordingto the manufacturer's instructions. There will be local variations in equipmentrequirements, cleaning solvent restrictions, etc. You must find out whatlocal rules require.<P>Keeping records is helpful even where it is not legally required. Recordshelp to prove that a shop is in compliance. Jobbers may be able to helpby providing copies of purchase records, where these are required. Wheredetailed job-by-job records are required, computer VOC tracking is veryhelpful.<P>Follow the rules and you can sleep easier - and we can all breathe easier!<H3>Dr. Kenneth Hine is the director of safety, health and environmentalaffairs for ICI Autocolor, North America.

<P>We've all seen the advertisements for the Chrysler LH cars and Ram trucks
in which Edward Herman concludes with, &quot; This changes everything.&quot;
What would you say to someone who claims to have developed a system which,
when implemented, really would change everything? And, in the process, solve
every problem the collision repair industry has? <P>
Well, someone is making that claim, and the system is called Wreck Check.
The system uses specially-designed software and a vast database of vehicle
damage information to determine the Diminished Value (DV) of autos which
have been repaired after an accident. System developer Jim Lynas, a former
body shop owner from Marietta, Ga., is typical of today's shop owners in
that he shares the frustration felt by repairers who have inherited today's
industry problems.
<H2>What's DV?</H2>
Our readers are aware of the consumer mindset in which one assumes his car
will never be the same after an accident. And, as professionals with a thorough
understanding of the processes involved, we know it won't be the same; however,
could it still be a proper repair?<P>
Given the proper training, equipment and compensation from the insurer-absolutely.
Unfortunately, this is not what the typical consumer believes. And there
have been enough problem children put back on the road by our industry to
warrant this stigma. According to Lynas, &quot;This type of stigma damage
limits the pool of prospective purchasers of property or automobiles, thus
lowering their value to the general public.&quot;<BR>

<B>Service Information</B></CENTER>
<P>While the debate in Detroit continues over the cost of new technology
versus what consumers want and can afford, for the service dealer, it all
translates into an information explosion. This slide shows the dramatic
growth in service information since 1980. Note that these figures represent
what Chilton Book Company produces. The actual number of technical pages
from all vehicle manufacturers runs well into the millions. How do you handle
such a vast amount of data? Most information providers are now putting their
databases on CD-ROM systems, allowing relatively quick access to critical
repair and maintenance information in the bay.<BR>

<B>Catera Cutaway</B></CENTER>
<P>The Cadillac Catera is a good example of what a car company does when
it wakes up one morning and realizes that their products have a longer life
expectancy than their primary buyer segment. In a bid to attract a younger
customer base, Cadillac has introduced their new Catera, an entry-luxury
model jointly developed with Adam Opel AG of Germany. The Catera is aimed
squarely at baby boomers who have made entry-luxury cars one of the hottest
segments in the market. Based on the Opel Omega MV6, Catera is powered by
a 200 hp DOHC 3.0L V6 with a cast iron block and aluminum cylinder heads.
The engine is designed to go 100,000 miles between tune-ups. <BR>

<P>This is the Buick XP2000 concept vehicle, whose design may look familiar.
It's a close relative of the new Aurora and Riviera body styles and represents
what Buick will be offering for sale in the next five years. The heart of
the XP2000 is a network of advanced computers which will tailor the car
to the needs and wants of the individual driver, as well as allow it to
use the Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems planned for the next century.<BR>

<B>Protosport 4 interior</B></CENTER>
<P>A look inside the Protosport shows the ergonomic, flowing lines that
appear inside as well as outside the vehicles of today. Note the grouping
of controls and the organic design of the seats. By the way, not all good
ideas are adopted. The four-point seat belt harness shown is a recurring
theme on may concept cars, but has yet to make it into production on even
high-performance models. Something that is making it into production is
called the catcher's mit design for passenger seating, which serves to better
keep vehicle occupants in their seats in the event of a collision.<P>

<P>The Speedster is a two-seat, open-air sport vehicle and could indicate
the direction of sport car design in the next century. It has what GM describes
as a retro look, something many carmakers are building prototypes around,
but wraps it in a contemporaty body design that looks as aggressive as it
does aerodynamic.<BR>

<P>The interior features chair-like seating that converts into a mobile
office. The passenger seat folds forward to create a flat work area, with
room for a mobile fax or laptop computer. Inside, there's room for everything
from scuba gear to topsoil, and the designers were thoughtful enough to
include a sports rack for bikes or skis, with convenient tiedowns to make
sure whatever you're carrying is with you on arrival.<BR>

<B>Plymouth Prowler </B></CENTER>
<P>The Prowler is a rear wheel drive roadster on a 113 inch wheelbase. Its
tire sizes are 225/45SR17 in front and 295/40R20 in back. The Goodyear extended
mobility (EMT) tires have run-flat capability and low tire pressure sensors
front and rear. The powertrain consists of a 3.5L, 24 valve, single overhead
cam V6 whose horsepower ratings are still a closely guarded secret. The
four speed, full adaptive electronically controlled AutoStick transaxle
is separated from the engine by an aluminum propshaft. Aluminum figures
prominently in the Prowler design, as its frame is all-aluminum.<BR>

<B>Ford Indigo</B></CENTER>
<P>The Indigo also serves as a test bed for lessons in engineering, material,
product development and processes that Ford can use in future production
models. Of particuar interest is the use of carbon fiber, fiberglass, and
both composite and hybrid materials in the construction. As far as the design
goes, wind tunnel tests have verified that the front and rear wings, along
with the underbody diffuser, will allow the Indigo to corner at a lateral
acceleration of over 1.2 g. <P>
The chassis is carbon fiber and aluminum honeycomb, with the engine mounted
to the central chassis along with the rear suspension. Both front and rear
suspensions are identical to those found on Indycars, which consists of
double wishbones with pushrod-activated coil-over shocks. The lightweight
materials result in a vehicle that weighs about 2300 pounds.<P>
Some other interesting aspects of this concept are high intensity discharge
light sources, pumped through fiber-optics to the main headlights mounted
in the rear view mirrors. The front spoiler doubles as a bumper.<BR>

<B>Ford Synergy Interior </B></CENTER>
<P>However, not all of the technology is in development. The extensive use
of aluminum to keep weight down reflects a trend that's already happening
on production models. Likewise, the whole hybrid vehicle concept is predicted
by some industry experts to be the most likely alternative vehicle design
to meet both low and zero emission standards proposed for states like California.<P>
One interesting feature worth mentioning is the Synergy's use of voice activation
for all electronic controls. The drive monitors vehicle operation via a
heads-up display projected onto a glass card from behind the steering wheel.
Computer animation updates vehicle speed, tachometer, fuel level, climate
control temperature, and the like. A separate liquid crystal message center
comes alive when voice activated to allow the driver to access the vehicle
navigation system, entertainment system and other accessories. In other
words, the Synergy 2010 is truly a car that does what you tell it to do.

<B>GM EV1 Electric Car </B></CENTER>
<P>A case in point is GM's new EV1 electric car, due to go on sale in selected
sunbelt areas in the fall. A direct decendant of the Impact concept vehicle,
the EV1 shares many of the Impact's styling cues and all of its electric
vehicle technology. One interesting note is the fact that the EV1 will be
the first GM vehicle to have a GM designation, as opposed to Chevy, Olds,
Pontiac, etc. Sold through Saturn dealers, the EV1 could represent the best
bet for electric vehicle technology to really catch on with consumers. It
will sell for about $35,000 a copy.<BR>

There are three areas of DV, the first type being inherent DV as described
above. The second type of DV is repair related. It is easy to see how a
poor repair will devalue a car. Not only does it decrease the owners' enjoyment
of the car, it has a profound impact on the car's value when it is sold.<BR>
Overspray, mismatched colors, poor welds and structural defects are examples
of repair-related DV.<BR>
The third type of DV is insurance related. For example, if an insurer insists
on substandard parts, refuses to compensate for necessary procedures, or
insists on unreasonable discounts-the inevitable results are a poor quality
repair and DV.
<H2>How Does It Work?</H2>
After repairs have been completed, a consumer may take his car to a Wreck
Check operator for an assessment. Following the vehicle's evaluation, he
can file a DV claim with his insurer. The Wreck Check assessment need not
be performed by someone other than the repairer who fixed the vehicle. One
can do a DV assessment on his own work.<P>
The inspection is visual and does not involve disassembly of the vehicle.
The purpose of the inspection is to reveal to a potential buyer or used-car
appraiser glaring indications that the vehicle had been in a wreck-for example,
an aftermarket hood panel which does not fit properly. <BR>
The system is not as subjective as one might imagine, because the dollar
values assigned to the various flaws are pre-programmed into the software.
For example, a flush-mounted door handle which was masked prior to a paint
operation is worth a pre-determined amount of DV, according to the formula
derived by Wreck Check officials. Wreck Check has conducted extensive research
on DV, parts and a variety of other industry surveys in order to produce
a series of DV formulas, which are updated frequently in the Wreck Check
database.<P>
After completing the inspection, the Wreck Check operator gives the consumer
a print-out showing the three areas of DV, the specific causes for each
and the total amount of market value lost.<BR>
Because DV claims are uncommon in the insurance industry, the consumer also
receives literature with information and advice on filing a claim. In addition,
a network of attorneys specializing in DV have made their services available
to Wreck Check customers. <P>
The most obvious benefit of the system is the service provided to the consumer.
For the first time, someone without a vested interest in the claims settlement
or repair process is looking out for the vehicle owner, who, in many cases,
is the unwitting victim of repair fraud. Insurance companies could benefit
from the system, too, since they also have an interest is seeing their customers
get the repairs for which they paid. <BR>

<B>Catera Powertrain</B></CENTER>
<P>One interesting note is that the Catera is a rear-wheel-drive design,
something that's becoming increasingly rare on assembly lines these days.
An electronically controlled four speed automatic transmission with overdrive
sends power to the rear wheels via a two-piece driveshaft and allows the
driver to select three modes of operation: sport, normal and low-traction.
As you might expect from a luxury carmaker like Cadillac, the Catera bulges
with standard features like ABS, automatic climate control (with an air
conditioned glovebox!), eight-speaker sound system and power accessories
too numerous to mention. It's also a good idea of the type of world-class
vehicle now being marketed to the buying public.<BR>

<B>Buick XP2000 Inteior</B></CENTER>
<P>Some of the unique new technology being pioneered here includes a system
called, appropriately, Customer's Choice. It works like this-each driver
is identified by an electronic code in a keyless fob. As he or she approaches
the vehicle, that digital code sent by the fob tells the XP2000's computers
to adjust the seat, steering column, outside mirrors, climate control and
entertainment system to the preferences of that particular driver. In addition,
the dynamic response of the car, including steering effort, transmission
shift points, engine response and suspension feel can be programmed using
Customer Choice. <P>
By the way, you'll note we said it was a keyless system. To start the car,
the driver inserts the fob into a slot in the instrument panel and presses
it momentarily. A security code in each fob allows the car to start only
if an authorized fob is used. To stop the engine, the driver simply removes
the fob from the slot. As with many concept vehicles, a heads-up display
passes important information onto the windshield, so the driver doesn't
have to take his eyes off the road. <P>
Other features include a computerized navigation system, voice command for
all accessories, the capability for automatic guidance and adaptive cruise
control, once they wire up the highways, a near-obstacle detection system
and four position front and side air bags. In the event of an accident severe
enough to deploy the airbags, the computers can be programmed to automatically
call the local police and ambulance service, and even to notify the driver's
personal physician.<BR>

<P>The interior shows that retro appearance I mentioned. It's very much
like the Mazda Miata, but evokes some of the early British and Italian sports
car designs, hopefully with better electrics. Modern touches include a full
frontal airbag for both driver and passenger, and a design that places all
instrumentation as low as possible to give the driver a more commanding
feel behind the wheel.<BR>

<B>Ford Indigo V12 Engine </B></CENTER>
<P>The V12 engine is a 48-valve, six liter unit developed from Ford's Duratec
engine family found in the Taurus and Sable lines. It puts out 435 horsepower
at 6100 rpm and delivers 405 ft. lbs. of torque at 5250 rpm. In practical
terms, that moves the Indigo from zero to 60 mph in a shade under four seconds.
Believe it or not, fuel economy is predicted to be about 20 mpg on the highway.<P>
The transaxle is a longitudinally mounted Reynard racing unit with six speeds,
hydraulic shifting and a manual clutch. The driver selects gears by hitting
an up or down button on the Nardi steering wheel, a feature typical of formula
one cars.<B> <BR>

<I>(&quot;What's Your Estimate,&quot; ABRN June 1996)</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER><HR SIZE="10" WIDTH="90%"></CENTER>
<P>We've all seen the advertisements for the Chrysler LH cars and Ram trucks
in which Edward Herman concludes with, &quot; This changes everything.&quot;
What would you say to someone who claims to have developed a system which,
when implemented, really would change everything? And, in the process, solve
every problem the collision repair industry has? <P>
Well, someone is making that claim, and the system is called Wreck Check.
The system uses specially-designed software and a vast database of vehicle
damage information to determine the Diminished Value (DV) of autos which
have been repaired after an accident. System developer Jim Lynas, a former
body shop owner from Marietta, Ga., is typical of today's shop owners in
that he shares the frustration felt by repairers who have inherited today's
industry problems.
<H2>What's DV?</H2>
Our readers are aware of the consumer mindset in which one assumes his car
will never be the same after an accident. And, as professionals with a thorough
understanding of the processes involved, we know it won't be the same; however,
could it still be a proper repair?<P>
Given the proper training, equipment and compensation from the insurer-absolutely.
Unfortunately, this is not what the typical consumer believes. And there
have been enough problem children put back on the road by our industry to
warrant this stigma. According to Lynas, &quot;This type of stigma damage
limits the pool of prospective purchasers of property or automobiles, thus
lowering their value to the general public.&quot;<BR>

<H2>Policing Ourselves</H2>
If you view the prospect of an independent shop re-inspecting your work
as an intrusion, or restraint of trade, consider this: Have you ever lost
a job to a shop which produces what you consider to be poor-quality work?
Wouldn't you have loved the opportunity to scrutinize the quality of the
competitor's work with the customer you lost? <P>
Do you believe that shops would pay more attention to the quality of their
work if they were fairly certain it would be re-inspected by someone working
for the consumer? And if that was the case, do you feel that fraud and cost-shifting
might not be as common as it is now? Once everyone realizes collision repair
work has to be done correctly and honestly, do you think labor rates might
be based on the actual cost of an honest repair by a competent shop? And,
if shops start getting adequate money for their time, do you think they
may be better equipped to attract some new blood to the industry?
<H2>For Us, By Us</H2>
The insurance companies have a head start in data collection. As we've been
told repeatedly over the years, &quot;Insurance companies know more about
your business than you do.&quot; And it's true.<BR>
Every Wreck Check appraiser will be linked to the Wreck Check server, and
each assessment is sent electronically to the corporate office to become
part of the database. Sound familiar? As Lynas says, &quot;This is for us-by
us.&quot;<P>
Eventually, the database will be used to identify trends, such as a particular
insurance carrier's disproportionate rate of underpayment in their claims
settlements, or consistently lower settlements to elderly people, minorities,
etc. As it compiles statistics from incidents of potential fraud uncovered
in Wreck Check assessments, the Wreck Check host computer will automatically
fax reports to the insurer and the appropriate state insurance commissioner.
<P>
Why is that important? Consider this: For years, insurers have identified
fraud as a major factor in high insurance rates-and passed that cost along
to consumers. Now, Wreck Check may give them the tools to correct that problem.
And if insurers make no effort in that direction well, the commissioner
may not be so inclined to grant rate increases.<BR>

<B>Catera Variable Intake Manifold.</B></CENTER>
<P>When it comes to new technology, and the direction electronic controls
are taking, a good example is Catera's three-stage, multi-ram induction
system, which increases torque at lower engine speeds and provides passing
power at highway speeds. In other words, what we have here is a variable
intake manifold-something relatively new for technicians to think about
when diagnosing driveability complaints on these types of vehicle down the
road.<BR>

<P>The XP2000 is powered by a five liter V8 and is a rear wheel drive design.
A five-speed automatic transmission gets the power to the ground and a fully
independent, computer-controlled suspension system adjusts for maximum aerodynamic
efficiency at all road speeds. One interesting note from a service standpoint
is the use of covers in the engine compartment. This is a cleaner, aesthetically
pleasing look that you'll be seeing more of in production vehicles from
all manufacturers.<BR>

<P>Since we are talking Pontiac here, no concept car would be complete without
an abundance of power under the hood. The Speedster is well-motivated with
a supercharged, 2400cc, twin-cam, 16-valve four cylinder engine pumping
out 225 horsepower. Note the move toward encapsulating much of the engine
compartment hardware. You'll be seeing more of this in years to come.<BR>

<H2>Mo' Money</H2>
A Wreck Check operator collects $75 for each assessment, $15 of which is
used by the corporation to update and maintain its database. The initial
cost of the Wreck Check system is $10,000, which includes a personal computer
(PC) with a minimum 16 megabytes of RAM, a minimum 500 megabytes of hard
disc storage, a 28.8 baud internal modem, a speedy Pentium 120 (or better)
processor, a Microsoft-compatible mouse, an SVGA 14-in. or larger color
monitor with 1 meg video RAM, a Cannon bubble jet color printer, and the
cables required for turnkey operation. Depending on the configuration purchased,
the system may also include a 3.5-inch (1.44 megabyte capacity) floppy drive
and/or a CD-ROM drive. In addition, software updates and the Black Book
vehicle valuation system are free to the user for the life of the Wreck
Check system.
<H2>The Skeptics Corner</H2>
Some say it'll never work. Why not? Well, the arguments vary widely: the
system is not independent, it cannot be embraced in a competitive marketplace
because repairers will be looking for flaws in each other's work, and so
on. ABRN contacted a variety of individuals likely to be affected by Wreck
Check-including a staunch advocate of DRPs and an independent Customer Satisfaction
Indexing firm-and asked what they thought about Wreck Check. Bob Thompson,
of BTE Collision in West Chester, Pa., knows enough about the system to
say that he doesn't agree with it. <P>
&quot;It doesn't seem like a positive thing for the industry, especially
for the repairers,&quot; said Thompson. &quot;I wouldn't want to be the
guy checking my neighbor's work. I think it has to be done from an independent
source [not from a local shop]. For example, I am a direct repair (DRP)
for several companies. If there was a guy in my area who didn't like me
being a DRP, I think in his eyes, I'm a real hard competitor and he will
find a flaw on everything that came out of here. He would look for things.&quot;<P>
According to Lynas, that is what is supposed to happen-bringing to light
poor repairs and correcting them. Lynas thinks the system will create a
more competitive marketplace because shops will have to generate quality
work to pass the Wreck Check inspection. It will benefit both the shop which
completed the repairs by producing high repair standards, the insurance
company by reducing costs (for re-repairs and less DV), and the consumer
by ensuring that he will receive good service, repairs and value. <BR>

<P>One interesting development is the use of modular add-on units, like
this Engine Tech module for the EDGE computer, called the Electronic Tool
Box or ETB, used by Sun Tech Systems. These units can provide additional

&quot;I think it [the system] will put intense pressure on any collision
repair facility, whether it be a DRP or an independent, to repair cars in
an ethical manner,&quot; said Lynas. &quot;If that is a negative reflection
on any specific branch of the collision repair industry, then the system
will bear that out. With the Wreck Check system in place, it makes it increasingly
difficult for repair facilities in a given area to cost shift, commit fraud
or produce lower quality repairs at a discount. This practice has a tendency
to drive down prevailing competitive rates, and allows repairers to return
to the days of competing for clients based on honesty, professionalism and
high quality.&quot;<P>
Denny Kiyohara of AutocheX, which does CSI work for collision repairers,
insurers and others, is not convinced that Wreck Check will be a viable
means of correcting fraud.<BR>
&quot;It could be,&quot; said Kiyohara. &quot;But brother against brother,
and saying one is a crook, doesn't sit well with me. You are saying that
'I'm successful, but my comrades are crooks', and we are trying hard to
prevent that grease-monkey image.&quot; <P>
In fact, Kiyohara acknowledged that there is a code of silence among repairers
which serves to perpetuate substandard work. However, he also introduced
another angle to the formula. According to Kiyohara, most people think their
car has gained value after a cosmetic repair. Kiyohara believes that a collision
repair can actually enhance the value of even a new car, which is supposed
to be flawless. <P>
While this does happen on occasion, most adjusters and DRP operators are
instructed to take betterment when the vehicle's condition is improved in
a damage claim.
<H2>Help For The Insurers</H2>
According to Lynas, and contrary to what some may believe about Wreck Check,
there is tremendous value for insurance companies in the system. Lynas says,
&quot;In the insurance and collision repair industries there is an enormous
waste of time, energy and resources in the estimating, re-inspection and
repair process. The current 'estimate, document and supplement' approach
is born out of an intense mistrust that both industries have of each other.
This approach is counter-productive and insensitive to the needs of our
mutual client, the consumer. A network of trustworthy, statistically proven,
superior quality repair facilities would allow insurers to drastically reduce
claims costs. The savings in repair fraud alone could be staggering. Wreck
Check provides that alternative.&quot;
<H2>Consumer Advocacy</H2>
Wreck Check is based on consumer advocacy, and its vice president and chief
financial officer, Margaret Fortson, is heavily involved with that portion
of the system. Fortson claims the company's approach to marketing is three-pronged:
getting the system into the appropriate playing field (shops), educating
the consumer by explaining the relationship between body shop and insurer,
and appealing to consumer advocates for support.<BR>

<P>For those of you wanting to know what the future looks like in the service
bay, this is part of it. Technicians now and in the next century are going
to be working more and more with computers. As you can see, it's not just
engine diagnosis anymore. These screens are from the EDGE ABS TECH software,
which allows the technician to perfrom sweep tests of virtually every sensor
and electronic component in the ABS system automatically, without the need
for a test drive.<BR>

<P>One of the most powerful aspects of all this wonderful computer technology
is the ability to look at several things simultaneously, as shown in this
ENGINE TECH screen. Note the various signal readings, displayed as waveforms
to make spotting trouble easier. And remember that all this capability is
available on a small computer, which reduces both cost and space requirements
in the shop. Also note that these slides were made from the playback mode
of this equipment, allowing diagnostic data to be saved for later analysis
or as a nifty training tool for technicians. What better way to explain
the intricacies of wave form analysis than to have on hand a library of
known good and bad patterns. <BR>

&quot;Now consumers will be able to gauge the level of quality they are
receiving from their insurance company. DV is owed to the consumer-insurers
are supposed to return the consumer's vehicle to pre-accident condition.
That is the foundation of insurance,&quot; said Fortson.<P>
ABRN spoke to a lawyer who is currently representing plaintiffs in several
DV suits. Tom Thrash, of the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas, thinks the service
is good for consumers if priced correctly, and agrees with the idea of DV
loss on vehicles. &quot;There should be an appraisal and a determination
as to how much value a vehicle has lost,&quot; said Thrash. &quot;I believe
that depending on the nature of the wreck, just about any vehicle will lose
value.&quot;<P>
According to Wreck Check officials, some insurers are in favor of the system.
One insurance company representative, who wished to remain anonomyous, told
ABRN that his company was looking into Wreck Check, and acknowledged the
occasional loss of value on vehicles after an accident. &quot;DV is not
something we can look up,&quot; said the spokesman. &quot;It is a difficult
area to deal with, so we are looking for a way of addressing it.&quot;
<H2>Swords Into Plowshares</H2>
All we hear about these days is change- it's on the lips of all our leaders.
Changes in technology, in business practices, in the fundamental relationships
between insurers and repairers are reshaping the industry. Old paradigms,
in which the three parties involved in a claim were pitched into an adversarial
struggle, have been abandoned by many. Now, some shops have laid down their
swords and learned to work with the insurance companies. <P>
But what have these developments done to the business? Is the industry more
efficient today? Unquestionably. Profit margins are such that repairers
can't survive in this business without efficient operations.<P>
Are we more profitable? Definitely not. Net profits have been in the single
digits for years and are falling steadily. Volume has been the answer for
those shops that continue to thrive in this market.<BR>
Has the level of quality in the shops who have embraced insurers as partners
increased? No. In fact, according to some of those very same shop owners-some
of whom are nationally-known industry leaders-it has decreased. Inferior
imitation parts and work have been adopted as a way of decreasing the insurer's
cost of settling claims-all at the expense of the consumer and job quality.
<P>
Those who have resisted these developments, and chosen to fight for their
customers, their profit margins and their very survival as independent businesses,
have felt the wrath of the insurer's might. One is presented with a choice:
go along and get along ... or suffer the consequences.<P>
These are the paradigms under which we now operate. However, if consumers
are made aware of DV (presumably a foregone conclusion) and they begin to
hold repairers to higher standards, brace yourself for some profound paradigm
shifts. <BR>

<H2>Pay Now Or Pay Later</H2>
Given their experience with insurers' business practices, in which they
can't get payment for simple charges like car covers, most repairers regard
DV like the tooth fairy. They are not convinced insurers will pay. Lynas
has this response: &quot;The reason you can't get paid for a car cover is
because insurers do not owe you anything. However, insurance carriers have
a contractual obligation to the policy holder.&quot;
<H2>What Do They Say?</H2>
All this talk about DV and its impact on the industry is academic if insurers
aren't willing to pay the claims. And what would keep the property and casualty
insurers from raising rates and/or removing this coverage from their policies?
Accordingly, ABRN contacted some property and casualty insurers for their
views on the DV situation. <P>
We began with Allstate, a company with a very large direct repair network
and one which has been paying DV claims. They refused to comment for this
story. Another insurer which has become a bellwether in the collision repair
market is USAA. They also refused to comment. However, they too, pay DV
claims. Fortunately, the granddaddy of them all, State Farm, did respond
to our request: &quot;We are familiar with with diminution of value claims.
If a claim for DV is covered under our policy contract, State Farm pays
such claims in those jurisdictions that recognize them as a compensable
item of damage, but only to the extent the claimant shows there has been
diminution of value.&quot;<P>
Other insurers responded as well, all with cautious-and sometimes contradictory-answers.
<BR>
Nationwide does pay DV claims, but according to the company, it's not a
big issue right now. Last year Nationwide paid 10 DV claims out of 1.2 million
total auto claims. &quot;Usually in those cases, the value is determined
by auto dealers and they state the loss of value in a letter,&quot; said
Bob Sohovich, a Nationwide spokesman. According to Sohovich, Nationwide
handles each DV claim on a case-by-case basis, but at the same time states
that most of their auto insurance policies are not priced to cover DV. &quot;If
this type of claim becomes popular, we would be forced to increase our prices.&quot;<BR>
Keith Lane, of Erie Insurance Group in Erie, Pa., began by saying, &quot;We
do not recognize DV, it's always been our corporate policy.&quot; However,
Lane ended the conversation on a different note. After ABRN asked him for
a letter in writing stating that his company would not recognize DV, Lane
refused, then said &quot;We treat each claim individually. Generally speaking,
we do not recognize DV.&quot;<BR>
For the perspective of someone who has been in the business for decades,
ABRN spoke to Bill Eveland, chairman of the Society of Collision Repair
Specialists (SCRS) and owner of Eveland Brothers Body Shop in Overland Park,
Kan. We asked Eveland if he felt that a repaired car suffers DV. <BR>

Eveland replied, &quot;Ten or 15 years ago we couldn't deliver pre-accident
condition, we didn't have the systems. But if a car's repaired properly,
if you use state-of-the-art procedures today, you can repair a car to its
pre-accident condition. So, in answer to your question, no. Although there
is a difference between a vehicle's value being diminished physically and
the perception that it has been diminished.&quot;<P>
We asked Eveland if he saw a need to provide accountability for those who
don't do the job properly. &quot;The accountability is a good thing. We
should be held accountable-as long as 'they' paid to do it properly. In
many cases, today's industry standard is substandard. The problem that's
killing us is insurers take the approach that a car is a car-they fix them
all the same. The insurance company wants to buy the stuff for less than
it's worth - the end result of which is mediocrity.&quot;
<H2>Last Word </H2>
Those who say we don't need a system like Wreck Check make the assumption
that the majority of collision repairs are proper, and the claims settlement
practices are worthy of the consumer's trust. However, as our readers well
know, this is not the case. <P>
According to the insurance industry, collision repair fraud is rampant.
Incidents of poor quality outnumber the first-class jobs. Repairs to pre-accident
condition are the exception, rather than the rule in most markets-and they
lay the blame for these conditions at the feet of the repair industry. <BR>
However, if you are a business person who delivers all that's been promised
- and one who consistently delivers a quality repair - Lynas says you have
nothing to fear. <P>
Lynas tells us the war is over. He says it's time to stop fighting with
insurance companies. He says the truth will set us free - and it may. Perhaps
this does, in fact, change everything. <P>
For more information about Wreck Check, call (770) 956-8700. <BR>

Does Auto-By-Tel deal in <a href="#7">used cars</a> too?<br>
I made a request through Auto-By-Tel recently and I <a href="#8">haven't heard from a dealer</a>.<br>
Can I make my <a href="#9">Request for an Auto-By-Tel Dealer in another state?</a><br>
I don't live in the United States. Does the Auto-By-Tel program work <a href="#11">internationally?</a><br>
I'm interested in becoming an Auto-By-Tel <a href="#subscribing">Subscribing Dealer</a>, who should I contact? </p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p><a name="1"><b>Is</b></a><b> the Auto-By-Tel service really free?</b><br>
YES! <br>
There is no charge to you, the consumer, to use the Auto-By-Tel service. There are no fees for you to pay, whether you 
buy/lease your new vehicle through us or not. There are no clubs to join, either.</p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p><a name="2"><b>Do</b></a><b> I pay more for my new vehicle because Auto-By-Tel is free?</b><br>
Auto-By-Tel exists to help you pay less for your new car. We are NOT a brokerage, so we don't charge our Subscribing 
Dealers on a per-car or per-customer basis. You will get pricing and delivery information up front, over the phone from the 
Subscribing Dealer in your area. We encourage you to compare this price to other dealers in your area. You'll find the price to 
be very competitive.</p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p><a name="4"><b>Am</b></a><b> I obligated to purchase the vehicle I request from Auto-By-Tel?</b><br>
Of course not. We operate on the Honor System -- there are really no strings attached to our program. We ask only that you 
DO NOT use Auto-By-Tel as a 'shopping service' to get pricing on multiple vehicles. This undermines the integrity of our 
program for dealers and other car buyers.</p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p><a name="12"><b>Can</b></a><b> I lease a car through Auto-By-Tel?</b><br>
Absolutely. Your Auto-By-Tel Dealer will offer competitive lease payments in the same manner that he provides competitive 
purchase prices. Additionally, Auto-By-Tel is working with large financing institutions to offer low-cost online lease 
applications and approval. Low-cost Online Leasing will debut early 1997.</p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p><a name="5"><b>What</b></a><b> about financing?</b><br>
Auto-By-Tel's Subscribing Dealers will finance your new vehicle at low rates (on approved credit). Additionally, Auto-By-Tel 
is working with Chase Auto Finance to offer online financing and approval. This exclusive Internet relationship with Chase 
means most Auto-By-Tel customers will receive low-cost financing rates and online financing approval within minutes after 
entering an application. Low-cost Online Financing will debut early 1997.</p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p><a name="6"><b>May</b></a><b> I request a price on more than one vehicle?</b><br>
In order to maintain the integrity of our program and to keep dealer costs at a minimum, Auto-By-Tel asks that users submit 
requests for the one vehicle they are prepared to purchase. </p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p><a name="7"><b>Does</b></a><b> Auto-By-Tel deal in used cars too?</b><br>
Auto-By-Tel will launch the largest Used Car Cyberstore in early 1997. Auto-By-Tel's Used Car Cyberstore will house tens 
of thousands of used cars available from Auto-By-Tel's Subscribing Dealers. Users will be able to search by vehicle type, 
year, make, model and even location. Photos of most cars will be available and all used cars listed will be certified by 
Auto-By-Tel, indicating that they have passed a stringent checklist. Please be sure to check </p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p><a name="8"><b>I</b></a><b> made a request through Auto-By-Tel recently and I haven't heard from a dealer. It's been over 48 hours -- what 
should I do?</b><br>
Auto-By-Tel appreciates your business and will do everything in our power to process your request by your schedule. If 
you're ready to buy a new vehicle and haven't heard from a dealer, please <a href="email.html">send us an e-mail</a> that includes your name, location 
and the type of car you've requested. </p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p><a name="9"><b>I'm</b></a><b> getting ready to move and want to buy/lease near my new home. Can I make my Request for an Auto-By-Tel 
Dealer in another state?</b><br>
Definitely. Just provide us with your NEW address in your Purchase Request and include a brief description of your plans in 
the 'comments' section. If you don't have your new address yet, your new ZIP CODE will do. We'll take care of the rest! </p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p><a name="11"><b>I</b></a><b> don't live in the United States. Does the Auto-By-Tel program work internationally?</b><br>
The Auto-By-Tel program is only available in the U.S. and Canada. At this time, Auto-By-Tel is not available in Guam and 
Puerto Rico.</p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p><a name="marketconditions"><b>Market Conditions Affect Price</b></a><br>
Unusual market conditions (production delays, short supply, etc.) make certain models and vehicles tough to be discounted 
beyond a certain level, even for Auto-By-Tel customers.</p>
<p>Auto-By-Tel Subscribing Dealers recognize this fact. As part of the Auto-By-Tel Program, they will aggressively price the 
exotic, rare or short-run vehicle you want. In other words, they value your business and will price their vehicles as 
competitively as they can .</p>
<p>These are some of the vehicles we've found that fall into this category. While supplies of vehicles vary from state to state (and 
province to province), these vehicles are generally in short supply in most parts of North America. Still, Auto-By-Tel 
Subscribing Dealers will provide very competitive pricing on these vehicles: </p>

<p align=left><b>Please note:</b> Virtually every manufacturer is currently in &quot;build-out&quot; for the 1996 model year. &quot;Build-out&quot;, in a nutshell, is the 
time of year-end production when shortages of current model (1996) vehicles can be expected before the next model year 
(1997) vehicles arrive in showrooms. &quot;Build-out&quot; affects different makers on a product-by-product basis; more popular 
vehicles are more likely to be affected. </p>

<p align=left><b>W</b><a name="know"><b>hat to expect from your Auto-By-Tel experience: </b></a><br>
The Auto-By-Tel process is designed to make car buying more convenient and less stressful than ever before.</p>
<p>After you've submitted your Purchase Request to us, here's what you can expect to happen next:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive, via e-mail, a note confirming that your Purchase Request has been received. </li>
<li>In this confirmation, we will give you the name and phone number of the Auto-By-Tel Subscribing Dealer who has 
received and will process your Purchase Request. </li>
<li>This Subscribing Dealer will contact you within 48 hours of receiving your Purchase Request. </li>
<li>Your Subscribing Dealer will commit to sell/lease at the price quoted to you over the phone -- no tricks or &quot;bait and 
switch&quot;! </li>
</ul>
<p>We think this competitive price, coupled with Auto-By-Tel's no-hassle program, will provide you with the most enjoyable 
car-buying experience you've ever had. </p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p align=left><a name="educated"><b>Be an Educated Buyer</b></a><br>
Our Subscribing Dealers are dedicated to giving you competitive prices and professional service, but how can you appreciate 
the value they provide unless you educate yourself?</p>
<p>We STRONGLY recommend that you &quot;do your homework&quot; and learn as much as you can about the vehicle you want to buy 
BEFORE you make a request to Auto-By-Tel. Use the available resources on the Internet and online services, along with 
unbiased magazines like Consumer Reports. We even encourage you to shop your local car dealers and compare the level of 
service and pricing they provide with Auto-By-Tel's Subscribing Dealers. You will then appreciate the convenience and 
honesty of the Auto-By-Tel Program.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a></p>
<p><a name="details"><b>Do Your Homework</b></a><br>
The more details you have about your vehicle choice, the better our system will work. The Auto-By-Tel Purchase Request 
form is very general, but we can process even the most specific request. Whether you know that you want that new Mustang 
GT in black, or Black Metallic Gloss, we can help you! </p>
<p>Use the comments section at the bottom of the form to get as specific as you like about the features you want. If you know the 
manufacturer's option packages, type them in. They are not necessary for Auto-By-Tel to process your request, but they will 
make it easier for our Auto-By-Tel Subscribing Dealer to properly equip the vehicle you want.</p>
<p>Additionally, we provide <a href="providers.html">links to vehicle information sources</a> to help you learn as much as you can as you make your purchase 
decision.</p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a></p>
<p><a name="request"><b>Auto-By-Tel Can Not Accept Multiple Requests</b></a><br>
We understand that getting a new vehicle is a very large purchase -- not one to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>When we receive a Purchase Request from you, we assume that you intend to buy or lease that vehicle in the near future. The 
Auto-By-Tel Subscribing Dealer who receives your request also assumes you are serious about making a purchase decision 
and will quote an aggressive price over the phone. Our Subscribing Dealers put in the extra time and effort to exceed your 
high expectations of the Auto-By-Tel Program, so we ask you not to burden them with multiple Purchase Requests.</p>
<p>If you want to inquire about purchasing more than one vehicle, please contact us via e-mail at <a href="MAILTO:manager@autobytel.com">manager@autobytel.com</a>.</p>
<p align=center><a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p align=left><a name="readytobuy"><b>Be Ready to Buy</b></a><br>
Our Auto-By-Tel Subscribing Dealers are committed to giving you very competitive prices. The price you receive from an 
Auto-By-Tel Subscribing Dealer has been computed especially for you, with the options and special features you have 
identified. Your dealer cannot guarantee the vehicle you have requested can be held in inventory for more than a few days 
after you have received a price quote.</p>
<p>Because of this, we recommend you send us a Purchase/Lease Request ONLY if you are serious about making a purchase 
within the very near future. That way, the price you're quoted by an Auto-By-Tel Subscribing Dealer will be the most accurate 
possible.</p>
<p align=center>&#160;<a href="request.html"><img src="hrpurchase.gif" alt="Go To Purchase Request" align=bottom border=0 width=576 height=23></a> </p>
<p><a name="marketconditions"><b>Market Conditions Affect Price</b></a><br>
Unusual market conditions (production delays, short supply, etc.) make certain vehicles difficult to discount, even for 
Auto-By-Tel customers. </p>
<p>These are some of the vehicles we've found that fall into this category. While supplies of vehicles vary from state to state (and 
province to province), these vehicles are generally in short supply in most parts of North America. Still, Auto-By-Tel 
Subscribing Dealers will provide extremely competitive pricing on these vehicles: </p>

<p>Models marked in italics are especially difficult to find in the northeastern United States.</p>
<p><b>Please note:</b> Virtually every manufacturer is currently in &quot;build-out&quot; for the 1996 model year. &quot;Build-out&quot;, in a nutshell, is the 
time of year-end production when shortages of current model (1996) vehicles can be expected before the next model year 
(1997) vehicles arrive in showrooms. &quot;Build-out&quot; affects different makers on a product-by-product basis; more popular 
vehicles are more likely to be affected.</p>

<A HREF="email.html"><IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=20 ALT="Talk To Us" ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="email.gif" border=0></A>


<P>Not long ago, Peter Ellis, Auto-By-Tel's President/CEO and Co-founder, was a car dealer himself, owning and operating 16 new car dealerships and related businesses before founding Auto-By-Tel. Dissatisfied with traditional factory-to-dealer-to-customer 
selling systems that resulted in high prices and frustrated customers, Pete
researched consumer attitudes about car buying. That research, along with his extensive experience, convinced him that consumers wanted to be in control of the buying process, not intimidated by persuasive salespersons! People wanted an easier, less costly way to buy. Pete listened and created Auto-By-Tel.

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>The Company</B></TD><TD><P>Auto-By-Tel Corporation runs the largest, most comprehensive automotive purchasing program on the Internet.  Auto-By-Tel's low-cost, no-haggle car buying system is available from coast to coast in the U.S. and Canada.</P>

    <P>    When Auto-By-Tel CEO and President Peter Ellis invented online
automotive purchasing, he revolutionized the car-buying and car-selling
processes.</P>

<P>The company's goal is to make car buying and car selling, which have long
been considered cumbersome by consumers and dealers, as painless as
possible. </P></TD></TR>
			



			
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Company History</B></TD><TD> <P>Auto-By-Tel was launched in March 1995, in Corona
del Mar, CA by Peter Ellis and John Bedrosian.  The company rapidly outgrew
its original office and, in September 1996, moved to a 12,000 square foot
building based in Irvine, CA where approximately 80 employees are on staff.</P>

<P>        According to a recent Arthur Andersen report, Auto-By-Tel's growth
has been phenomenal. For example, in September 1995, Auto-By-Tel processed
5,500 Purchase/Lease Requests and, one year later in September 1996,
Purchase/Lease Requests were six times that number at over 35,000.  To
date, Auto-By-Tel's total Purchase/Lease Requests exceed 400,000.</P>

<P>        In September 1996, Auto-By-Tel completed a $15 Million Series A
Preferred Financing.  Investors included GE Capital Services, AIG,
ContiFinancial and Michael Fuchs, former Chairman and CEO of HBO and the
Warner Music Group.</P>
</TD></TR>


<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>The Program</B></TD><TD><P>Auto-By-Tel is a marketing and information service on the
Internet through which consumers have the opportunity to buy, lease and
insure cars and trucks at a low cost.  At the Auto-By-Tel web site
(www.autobytel.com), the consumer can submit a free Purchase/Lease Request
for their vehicle of choice.  Purchase/Lease Requests are routed to local
ABT accredited dealers who call the consumer within 48 hours with a low,
competitive, no-haggle price.  To best serve this empowered Internet
consumer, Auto-By-Tel pre-qualifies and trains its subscribing dealers.</P>

<P><B>The Auto-By-Tel program is free to the consumer. </B> There's no obligation, no
hidden fees and no club to join.  Auto-By-Tel eliminates the intimidation
often found at dealerships, including unpleasant negotiations with a
salesperson.</P>

<P>        Auto-By-Tel is the one-stop-shopping source for car buyers. The ABT
customer can view and research a prospective vehicle via Auto-By-Tel's
automobile information providers and then shop for low-cost auto insurance
through AIG (American International Group, Inc.).
        Additionally, throughout 1997, Auto-By-Tel will introduce exciting
new programs, including low-cost exclusive online financing through Chase
Auto Finance, a certified Used Car Cyberstore, and the ABT Mobilist
Program.</P></TD></TR>


<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>The Philosophy</B></TD><TD> <P>Auto-By-Tel is revolutionizing the way cars are bought and
sold.  The company is using technology, namely the Internet, to change the
way the automotive industry works.</P>

<P>        Auto-By-Tel works diligently with every Subscribing Dealer to
change the traditional sales model, ensuring that each Auto-By-Tel customer
is treated in a respectful manner and offered the lowest possible price.
Auto-By-Tel encourages Subscribing Dealers to set up an Auto-By-Tel
Department where an Auto-By-Tel Manager, not a traditional salesperson,
works with the ABT customer.</P>

<P>        Auto-By-Tel believes in taking the pain out of the car-buying and
car-selling process.  By providing a one-stop, money-saving car source for
consumers and a cost-efficient, volume-enhancing sales system for its
participating dealers, Auto-By-Tel has created a process in which everyone
wins.</P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>The Programs</B></TD><TD> <P><B>Low-cost Car Buying and Leasing</B> through 1,500-plus
Auto-By-Tel Subscribing Dealers in the U.S. and Canada.<BR>

<B>Low-cost Auto Insurance</B> from AIG.</P>

<B>Certified Used Car Cyberstore</B><BR>

<B>Mobilist Affinity Program</B></P>
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Customers</B></TD><TD><P>Auto-By-Tel customers are smart shoppers.  They are looking
for the best price and the best service.  They have vast amounts of
information available to them over the Internet, including MSRP and invoice
pricing.</P>

<P>        Because Auto-By-Tel customers  have done their research and are
ready buyers looking for a non-negotiable price, transactions are
expeditious resulting in lower dealer costs.</P>

<P>According to Auto-By-Tel customer, Cameron Cook, "Purchasing a car through
Auto-By-Tel was the most pleasurable automotive buying experience I've ever
had.  It was simple and fast."
</P>
<P>Auto-By-Tel customers reflect the demographics of the Internet.  The
average age is thirty-five; they own homes worth about $225,000 and their
average household income is over $80,000.</P>

<B>John C. Bedrosian, Chairman and Co-founder</B><BR>




<P>Recognizing that the auto industry of 1994 was in the dark ages, much as the health care industry was in the 1960's, health care industry innovator John Bedrosian joined Peter Ellis in co-founding Auto-By-Tel in 1995.  Bedrosian anticipated Auto-By-Tel's growth potential and predicted that it would be faster than that of the for-profit health care industry.</P>





<P>Previously, Bedrosian was senior executive vice president, director and co-founder of National Medical Enterprises, Inc. (NME), a publicly-traded, four-billion dollar company (recently re-named Tenet Healthcare Corporation).  While serving as a member of the Board of Directors, he was responsible for NME's corporate communications, investor, industry and government relations, and administration.  He was also a prominent industry spokesman on health care issues.</P>





<P>Prior to the founding of NME in 1969, Bedrosian practiced law extensively in the health care field.</P>




<P>
Bedrosian holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from the University of California at Los Angeles and an LL.B. degree from the University of Southern California School of Law.  He lives in Los Angeles, CA with his wife Judy and has three children. </P>

<HEAD><TITLE>Auto-By-Tel--Peter Ellis</TITLE></HEAD> 
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" LINK="#309428" VLINK="#1759BD"><BR>
<CENTER><a href="/cgi-bin/imagemap/maps/bannermap.map"><IMG VSPACE=1 HSPACE=1 BORDER=0 ALT="This is a clickable imagemap, see text links at the bottom of the page." SRC="bannermap1.gif" ISMAP></A></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=251 HEIGHT=41 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=20 ALT="Founder Profile" SRC="founder.gif"></CENTER><BR>











<B>Peter Ellis, President, CEO and Co-founder </B><BR>




<P>A seasoned automotive executive, Peter Ellis has had three decades of automotive industry experience. After selling his first car when he was just sixteen years old, Ellis went on to own sixteen new car dealerships and other related automotive businesses throughout California and Arizona, becoming one of the most-famous car dealers in Southern California. 
</P>




<P>Ellis is known for his consumer-oriented marketing strategies. He was one of the first dealers to perceive the benefit of disclosing bottom-line pricing, a forerunner to the one-price selling strategy that is popular today. He also realized that customers would welcome the opportunity to make single car purchases from fleet departments that normally sold in volume to large businesses.</P>





<P>In 1994, disappointed with traditional factory-to-dealer-to-customer selling systems that resulted in high prices and frustrated customers, Ellis investigated alternatives.  His research demonstrated that consumers wanted to be in control of the buying process, not intimidated by persuasive salespersons.  So, convinced that the rapidly developing Internet would be the best place to accomplish efficient, consumer-friendly car-buying, he launched Auto-By-Tel in early 1995.
</P>




<P>Ellis has two children and lives with his wife, Susie, a nationally-known fitness expert, in Corona del Mar, CA.  He is a native of San Jose, CA and a graduate of San Jose State University. 
</P>

<h2><font color="#ff0f05" size=+1>Informations &agrave; avoir en mains lors de votre appel chez AIG </font></h2>

Cet important programme d'assurance est souscrit par les compagnies membres
de AIG, l'American International Group Inc, l'une des compagnies
d'assurance les plus importantes et les plus respectables des &eacute;tats-Unis.<p>

Afin de traiter rapidement et efficacement votre demande AIG nous a demand&eacute;
que vous ayez, lors de votre appel, les d&eacute;tails suivants en mains :



<ul>

<li><b>Votre police d'assurance actuelle;
</b>

<li><b>Votre dossier de permis de conduire, incluant des accidents et violations
du code de la route, pour vous et pour tous les membres de votre famille

<p>

<br>





<h2><font color="#ff0f05" size=+1>Pourquoi Auto-By-Tel a choisi AIG </font></h2>

Auto-By-Tel a bien &eacute;tudi&eacute; les dossiers de nombreuses compagnies lors de ses
recherches pour trouver un assureur automobile qui s'occuperait
conciencieusement de ses clients et qui procurerait des prix comp&eacute;titifs.
Notre objectif &eacute;tait de trouver une compagnie qui pourrait atteindre le
niveau de qualit&eacute; de service &agrave; la client&egrave;le d'Auto-By-Tel dans les domaines
suivants :
<br>

<BLOCKQUOTE>* tarifs comp&eacute;titifs;<br>

*service &agrave; la client&egrave;le de qualit&eacute; et prise en charge efficace des
r&eacute;clamations des clients;
<br>

* cote &eacute;lev&eacute;e de la part de maisons de cotation.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>



Nous croyons que les compagnies membres de AIG (American International
Group Inc), l'une des plus importantes et plus prestigieuses compagnies
d'assurance au monde, r&eacute;pondent &agrave; ces crit&egrave;res. D'ailleurs, les compagnies
membres d'AIG ont re&ccedil;u la plus haute note de cotation possible, soit :

<p>

<center><b>A++ (sup&eacute;rieur) de la part de la compagnie A.M. Best
.</center><p>



Cette note, obtenue de la part d'une des maisons de cotation les plus
respect&eacute;es de l'industrie, est un gage de la stabilit&eacute; financi&egrave;re, du
s&eacute;rieux et de la performance g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des compagnies membres de AIG. Nous
croyons que ce programme d'assurance automobile poss&egrave;de une grande valeur,
une grande facilit&eacute; de fonctionnement et un service exceptionnel. Si vous
avez des questions ou des commentaires &agrave; formuler &agrave; propos du service que

<BR>

Le service Auto-By-Tel est-il vraiment <A HREF="#1">gratuit </A>?<BR>

<A HREF="#2">Mon v&eacute;hicule neuf sera-t-il plus cher  </A> puisqu'Auto-By-Tel est gratuit ?
<BR>

Suis-je <A HREF="#3">oblig&eacute; d'acheter </A> le v&eacute;hicule que j'ai demand&eacute; &agrave; Auto-By-Tel ?<BR>

Est-il possible de <A HREF="#4"> louer </A>un v&eacute;hicule grce &agrave; Auto-By-Tel ?

<BR>





Qu'en est-il du  <A HREF="#5">financement ?</A><BR>

Puis-je demander un tarif pour <A HREF="#6">plusieurs v&eacute;hicules ?</A><BR>



Le prix des v&eacute;hicules est-il influenc&eacute; par les  <A HREF="#7">fluctuations du march&eacute;</A><BR>

Auto-By-Tel s'occupe-t-il aussi de <A HREF="#8">v&eacute;hicules usag&eacute;s 
</A>.<BR>

J'ai r&eacute;cemment plac&eacute; une demande d'achat &agrave; Auto-By-Tel et  <A HREF="#9">personne ne m'a encore contact&eacute;.
</A><BR>

Est-il possible de placer une  <A HREF="#10">demande pour un concessionnaire Auto-By-Tel situ&eacute; dans une autre province ou &eacute;tat 
</A><BR>

Je ne r&eacute;side pas aux &eacute;tats-Unis; le programme Auto-By-Tel fonctionne-t-il <A HREF="#11">partout dans le monde 
</A><BR>


Qui dois-je contacter afin de devenir un<A HREF="#12">cconcessionnaire

<P>Veuillez noter que  presque tous les manufacturiers sont en manque de

<P><B><A NAME="gm">GM/VW Finally Settle Differences Out-of-Court<BR></A></B>

An out-of-court settlement was finally reached last week between GM and VW ending the long-running trade theft suit.  Volkswagen AG agreed to pay General Motors Corp. $100 million and buy at least $1 billion worth of GM parts over the next 7 years.  GM will in turn drop the civil suit against VW and several of the top VW executives in U.S. District Court in Detroit. The drama began in March of 1993 when Jose Ignacio Lopez, who still faces criminal charges in Germany, was on the verge of being promoted to General Motor's chief of North American operations.  He (and several other GM executives) moved overnight to Volkswagen apparently taking with him thousands of pages of documents and computer diskettes.  Lopez and three other former GM managers, Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Rosario Piazza, and Jorge Alvarez who defected to VW were indicted last month on charges of stealing GM secrets.  The prosecutors claimed that there were no grounds to indict VW, VW chief, Piech, or other executives.  Industry analyst Kenneth Blaschke of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. stated, "overall the money was not as significant as we might have expected, but it's probably best for both companies to get this issue behind them."  He believes the sum is not that large considering what VW spends on parts, nor is the amount big enough to have a significant effect on other parts suppliers.  If the case had gone to trial, VW would have stood to lose billions of dollars.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="mazda">Mazda and Ford Partners in Electric Cars </A></B><BR>

Mazda and its partner Ford are required to sell electric cars in California starting in 1998, and to that end, Mazda will acquire approximately 120 vehicles from Ford over the next three years.  Initially, Mazda will carry lead battery electric vehicles that Ford has already designed in order to cut back on development costs.  Ford plans on developing autos using nickel hydroxide batteries, while Mazda is working with Sanyo Electric and others on lithium ion battery-driven cars.  Ford will use lead batteries on minivan and pickup models.</P>




<BR>

<P><B><A NAME="safer">Safer Airbag Controversy Continues...</A></B><BR>

Safer airbag rules may be enforced as early as next month according to Federal safety officials.  Although airbags have saved roughly 1,700 lives since their inception in the 1980's, they have also been blamed for the deaths of 32 children and 20 adults, (women and elderly people).  The force of an airbag, 200 mph, has been the cause of much controversy recently, and the new airbag regulations will help reduce danger by slowing down inflation speed by 20-35%.  However, it is feared by many experts that this could also result in less protection for unbelted adults.   Another glitch in the debate over safer airbags is that tests on airbags now cover unbelted occupants, which requires that airbags deploy with higher speed than would be necessary for tests run on belted occupants.  When airbag rules were first enforced only 15% of Americans wore seat belts which set the explosive force of the airbag in order to protect the unbelted 85%.  Currently, 70% of Americans wear seat belts which many believe should be the standard in setting the airbag regulations. </P>  
<P>Senator Dirk Kempthorne, R-Idaho, is urging Ricardo Martinez, National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator, to end car crash standards based on unbelted adults.  Martinez claims that he does not have the authority to proceed with the demands of carmakers and safety experts to make airbags even safer by easing crash standards used in regulating airbags.  He claims that Congress will have to take that step. Kempthorne stated that the administration has known for years that the unbelted standards that require such force in fast-deploying airbags could kill or seriously injure children and women.  Now, he believes, is the time to act.</P>  
<P>According to Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, if the regulations came out next month, Detroit could begin to fit the lower powered bags on 1998 model cars.  The new regulations would de-power the bags until carmakers designed what is known as a "Smart" airbag which could sense if a child or small person was riding in the passenger seat and automatically reduce the bag's inflation speed.  Dealers and mechanics would also be allowed to deactivate airbags if the owner so desired under the new regulation.  </P>

<P><B><A NAME="mazda2">Mazda Pulls the Plug on Minicars
</A></B><BR>

According to reliable sources, Mazda is pulling the plug on production of minicars in order to focus on other types of automobiles.   Apparently one of the main reasons Mazda wants to withdraw from the minicar rat race is that, in October 1998, the Ministry of transport plans to revise its standards for minicars, allowing automakers to manufacture longer and wider vehicles than existing models. Mazda believes that remodeling its minicars to the new standards would cost more than it could handle.  It is estimated that Mazda will save 86 million dollars by pulling out, and instead will source its entire minicar line from Suzuki Motor Corp.  Mazda currently makes minicars with Suzuki's engines.  Sources also speculate that Mazda will possibly be forced to rely more heavily on Suzuki, as Mazda currently solicits Suzuki's sport-utility Wagon R and a commercial vehicle, the Every, for sale under the Mazda badge.  Mazda started as a minicar maker, and now believes that the demand for minicars will decrease in the near future.  Mazda is now setting its sights on developing common-platform cars with its partner, Ford Motor Company.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="stormy">Stormy Weather in the Northwest Damages Dealerships and Hurts Sales
</A></B><BR>


Although it's too early to tell just how many dealerships were damaged in the severe storms of late in the Pacific Northwest, it is clear that the wreckage at auto dealerships in that region is serious and widespread.  The snow storm in Seattle was the worst the city had seen in 50 years, and its effects on auto dealerships was made worse due to the flat roofs on the some of the dealerships which have the tendency to cave in under too much weight.  A Mercedes showroom roof caved in completely on December 29th at Barrier Motors in Bellevue, Washington which flattened three cars.    Collapsing awnings, the weight of the snow on top of cars, and broken tree limbs falling on cars accounts for most of the damage that the ice, snow, and monsoon rains brought with it.   Fearing flood, many dealers in Seattle have moved their cars to higher ground.  Given that it's the slowest time of the year, sales will be hurt even more which (on the bright side) may bring some great deals for car buyers in the Northwest in the not so distant future.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="toytoy">Toyota to Recall Tocoma Trucks</A></B><BR>

Toyota is voluntarily recalling 90,000 late-model pickups, according to a report in The Dallas Morning News. Toyota has acknowledged that it will recall the 1995-96 Tacoma models to examine and replace front suspension brackets which can weaken and crack under heavy stress.</P>
<P>Toyota alerted the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) of the potential problem in July and the agency felt the situation wasn't serious enough to warrant a safety recall, so it cleared the way for a voluntary recall.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="saturn3600">Saturn Recalls 3,600 Coupes</A></B><BR>

Saturn is recalling 3,600 new coupes because of a safety problem relating to passenger seats that don't always latch properly into place, according to an AP report. Saturn has only sold around 1,500 of the effected 1997 SC1 and SC2 models-the others are in stock and were removed from showrooms.
</P>


<P><B><A NAME="porsche">Porsche Recall</A></B><BR>

Porsche announced August 1, 1996 that it's recalling 54,000 vehicles for routine checks. According to the company, thirteen cars in the Porsche 911 series have had faults in the steering shafts. The affected models were built between 1989 and 1992. The checks on the steering system should take about 20 minutes.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="corollaprizm">Corolla, Prizm Recall</A></B><BR>

A problem with airbags systems that can malfunction after liquid is spilled in the console is behind the recall of 1993-1995 Toyota Corollas and Geo Prizms. Tests performed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have determined that soda, water or other liquid spilled into the console area of the small cars could cause the airbag warning light to illuminate. In some cases, the problem can cause the airbag to inflate without an accident occurring.
The recall includes 494,422 Corollas and 135,436 Geo Prizms.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="chrysler22">Chrysler Recall</A></B><BR>

Chrysler is recalling 321,000 minivans and mid-sized and large cars due to potential anti-lock brake system failures. </P>
<P>The vehicles affected include 1990-93 Chrysler Imperial, New Yorker and Dodge Dynasty models; 1991-92 Dodge Monacos and Eagle Premiers; and 1991-93 Chrysler Town & Country, Dodge Caravan, Grand Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager minivans. Dealers will test the ABS components and replace worn parts if needed.</P>


<P><B><A NAME="cherokee">Jeep Cherokees Recalled in Japan</A></B><BR>

Chrysler's Japan division plans to recall more than 20,000 Jeep Cherokee and Grand Cherokee SUVs to fix problems with coolant leakage and a defective parking brake.</P>




<P>According to AP reports, the recall involves 14,155 vehicles imported between September 1992 and October 1994 and 6,647 vehicles imported between November 1994 and May 1995.</P>


<P><B><A NAME="chrysler">Chrysler Fights Forced Recall</A></B><BR>

The NHTSA Tuesday ordered the recall of 91,000 1995 Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus cars because of weak seat belt anchors-a recall Chrysler intends to fight. The Justice Department has filed an unprecedented lawsuit in an effort to force Chrysler to implement the recall.</P>
<P>Chrysler has vowed to fight the action, saying it disagreed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's testing procedures that led to that recall.</P>
<P>Chrysler claims that under normal testing conditions, the cars met government testing requirements. NHTSA has reported no incidents of real-world use failures but based its decision to institute the recall when a rear seat belt lap anchorage pulled out of the floor of a 1995 Cirrus during a routine test.  </P>
<P>Since the 1995 findings, Chrysler has changed the design of the anchorage and the configuration now meets all government standards. Consumer advocates lauded the NHTSA action.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="ford2">Ford Plays It Safe</A></B><BR>



The Associated Press reported Monday that Ford Motor Co. has announced two separate recalls of 104,360 cars and trucks to fix door latches that do not meet federal standards or faulty wires that could cause a fire.  
The company recalled 73,500 1996-model Ford Crown Victoria, Thunderbird, Explorer, Aerostar, Mercury Grand Marquis, Cougar and Lincoln Town Car to fix a secondary door latch on the driver's side.</P>
<P>Ford is also notifying 30,860 owners of 1994-95 F-Series Super Cab trucks equipped with a 40-20-40 power driver's seat of a recall to fix wiring that could cause an electrical short and possibly spark a fire.
According to Ford spokeswoman Francine Romine,  no injuries have been reported involving either recall.</P>






<P><B><A NAME="ford">Ford Recall Misses Potentially More Dangerous Models</A> </B><BR>

Ford's April 25 recall of almost 9 million cars for faulty ignition switches-the largest recall in automotive history-left out tens of thousands of potentially more fire-prone vehicles according to USA Today.  The paper says that National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports show the Aerostar, which was not included in the recall, has the second-highest rate of ignition switch fires of any Ford truck.  The government documents show the 1986 and 1987 Econolines have ignition fires at about twice the rate of some recalled pickups.</P>



<P><B>A Second Ford Recall In Less Than 2 Weeks</B><BR>

Ford announced that it is recalling almost 50,000 of its 1995 Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis cars that may have faulty rear-seat shoulder safety belts.  Spokeswoman for Ford, Francine Romine, says that the repair should take about one hour and that owners should contact their dealers for an appointment.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="gm">GM Recalls 44,000 Cars</A></B><BR>

General Motors announce a voluntary recall of about 44, 000 of its 1996 Buick Regal and Chevrolet Lumina sedans to inspect the cars' left front brake lines.  The company said the brake lines may contain a defect which could cause a loss of brake fluid and eventual loss of one-half of the vehicle's braking system.  GM says that it has been notified of five instances of the defect but that no injuries have been reported.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="nissan">Nissan Recall: Largest Japanese Recall Ever</A></B><BR>

Nissan Motor Co. plans to recall 1.1 million vehicles-the largest ever in Japanese automotive history-to repair defective condensers and seat-belt devices.  Nissan has reported six instances of fire erupting from defective condensers, a small part in the engine compartment designed to prevent radio noise.  The other potential defect involves a seat-belt tightening device which produces high-temperature gas potentially causing a fire.  Of the 1.1 million vehicles being recalled, approximately 70,000 were exported to the united States and include Infiniti J30 and G20 models produced between July 1992 and March 1994.

<P><B><A NAME="gm">GM/IRS Battle Over Taxes<BR></A></B>


The Wall Street Journal recently reported that General Motors is challenging the Internal Revenue Service's claim that it owes more than $335 million in unpaid taxes for 1985.  GM paid $714.8 million in taxes in 1995, and, according to the IRS, it should have paid $1.05 billion.  GM claimed a taxable income of $3.78 billion, while the IRS is charging that GM had taxable income of $4.96 billion.  The government states that the discrepancy lies in the fact that GM's taxable income for 1985 involved a complex financing program whereupon GM's financial arm reimbursed dealers for offering customers financing rates lower than any other lender. </P>

<P><B><A NAME="chrysler">Chrysler Expands to Taiwan</A></B><BR>

Chrysler has solidified a deal to set up a warehousing center in Taichung Harbor, Taiwan and plans to import one million cars into the island within 20 years.  The deal, signed by a local agent, promises that Chrysler will import a minimum of 16,752 cars a year into the island in hopes of increasing the harbor's income by more than T$21 million a year which, in turn, would bring Taiwan an annual tariff income of more than T$3.2 billion.  Taiwan has been trying to attract international companies to set up regional operations on the island for several years.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="jaguar">Jaguar XK8 Wins Luxury Award</A></B><BR>

The Robb Report Car of the Year is the Jaguar XK8.  The Robb Report, a consumer magazine on luxurious living, boasts a readership with an average income of $755,000 and an average net worth of $3.7 million.  According to surveys, 78% of the country's billionaires read the Robb Report, making this award coveted among luxury automakers.  The award, a crystal trophy from Geary's of Beverly Hills, was presented at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show.  </P>
<P>The Jaguar XK8 was chosen for its design and countless amenities that appeal to luxury seekers.  The race was between the Mercedes-Benz E420 Sport, BMW 5401 Sport, BMW Z3, Ford Expedition, Infiniti Q45, Audi A8 4.2 Quattro, the Mercedes-Benz SLK230, and the Infiniti Q45.  Last year's winner was the Mercedes-Benz E320.  The Jaguar XK8 is the first new sports model in 21 years from Jaguar, and it features Jaguar's traditional elegance both inside and out.</P>

<P><B><A NAME="gm2">GM and the Fashion World Make a Splash for a Good Cause
</A></B><BR>

Concept:Cure, which has raised $708,000 for breast cancer research at Georgetown University's Nina Hyde Center, was born from a unique collaboration between the automotive and fashion industries.  Top fashion designers Mark Eisen, Nicole Miller, Todd Oldham, Anna Sui, and Richard Tyler teamed up with General Motors to design one-of-a-kind "Ultimate Vehicles".  Eisen worked on a Chevrolet Camaro Z28, while Miller designed a Cadillac STS.  Oldham worked on an Oldsmobile "Bravada"; Sui lent her talents on a GMC Yukon, and Tyler designed a Buick Riviera. </P> 
<P>The creative juices have been flowing and it shows.  For example Miller's STS interior sports braided leather steering wheel cover and black onyx trim.  Sui's Yukon includes a black rose applique embedded in the Yukon's clear-coat paint, as well as leopard-print carpeting and the use of patent leather.  Tyler used trapunto stitching and subtle two-tone colors.</P>  
<P>Concept:Cure was developed to build relationships with women through relevant ideas and meaningful issues. There are more collaborations planned, including the Riviera-sponsored concert series featuring Judy Collins and Roberta Flack that will begin this spring.  Proceeds will benefit breast cancer research.  You can check out duplicate versions of the Tyler-designed Riviera at auto shows and at Tyler's trunk shows.

<BR><B><FONT SIZE=5>News from Los Angeles Auto Show</FONT></B><BR>

<P><B><A NAME="suzuki">Suzuki Sidekick Sport JS 
</A></B><BR>

Suzuki Motor Corp. introduced the new Sidekick Sport JS two-wheel drive sport/utility vehicle at the LA Auto Show.  The Sidekick Sport JS is joining the expanded SUV lineup which includes the four-wheel drive Sidekick Sport JX and JLX.  The Sport JS $16,699 price tag makes it quite appealing to the new SUV consumer.  The vehicle is equipped with Suzuki's five-speed manual overdrive transmission, and powered by 1.8 liter, dual overhead cam, as well as the aluminum engine found in the JX and JLX.  Standard features include air, power steering, power windows, and door locks.  There are also key comfort and convenience features like a remote fuel filler door release, dual cup holders, remote keyless alarm system, and a 100-watt, four-speaker stereo system engineered by Alpine.  The Sport JS also includes standard safety features such as air bags, rear-door child safety locks, and reinforced side impact protection and daytime running lights. </P>

<P><B><A NAME="kia">Kia Sportage 2-Door Convertible
</A></B><BR>


Kia's third U.S. model car is the Sportage 2-Door Convertible (slated for arrival in 1998). This will be the first Sportage convertible to be sold in any country.  Kia is hoping to appeal to a younger, hipper consumer and is making over the new Kia with contemporary styling, including sporty interior fabric, special alloy wheels, and a wider range of exterior colors.  The Kia also has excellent maneuverability with true on and off-road capabilities.  To make removing the top easier, Kia has created an easy-to-fold soft top.   The side windows on the convertible top can also be unzipped while the top is up. </P>




<BR>

<P><B><A NAME="mercedes">Mercedes-Benz SLK
</A></B><BR>


The anxiously awaited Mercedes-Benz SLK came out in style at the Los Angeles Auto Show and will be available in the United States this month.  The SLK sets new standards in the two-passenger sports car market.  It was recognized by Car & Driver Magazine as one of the "Ten Best" new vehicles. That award is owed to its high-performance engine, sophisticated independent suspension which includes 0-60 mph acceleration, and responsive transmission.  The SLK can transform from a closed coupe to a fully open roadster in 25 seconds making it the sports car for all seasons.  This is a first -- a fully automatic retracting hardtop that only requires the push of a button to activate the folding roof to retract completely into a rear compartment. The hardtop also provides increased security against theft.   Another first is the SLK BabySmart system, a low-power radio signal from the passenger seat that prompts a return signal from the resonator. This new technology turns off the passenger airbag whenever a special child seat is belted into avoid injury to a small child from the fast-moving airbag. </P>
<P>Because this car comes loaded, the SLK only includes three options: heated seats, metallic paint, and choice of telephone/CD changer combinations. The SLK can be yours in Bahama Blue, Sunburst Yellow, and Calypso Green on the outside, and leather upholstery on the inside.    The suggested retail price is $39.700. </P>

<CENTER><H2>Motor City's Motor Show</H2>
Domestic and Import Automakers Have Plenty to Show in Detroit
</CENTER><P>





<P>Despite its rough and tumble image, Detroit is showing strong signs of urban renewal. A thriving theater district, neighborhoods of restored turn-of-the-century homes and plans for new downtown baseball and football stadiums indicate that the city's pulse is strengthening. </P>
<P>One of the events that draws thousands of journalists and hundreds of thousand spectators each January is the North American International Auto Show. And, although the show is popular with domestic automakers, it's growing in popularity with importers, too. This is because other international shows, such as Paris and Tokyo, occur biennially. Detroit's annual display give importers a stage on which to unveil their latest products.</P>
<P>It's no surprise, then, to find more and more importers using Detroit to reveal all-new vehicles. The 1997 show revealed the most imports to date, not to mention a slew of production-ready and concept vehicles from Ford, GM and Chrysler. But, no matter which automaker, sport utility vehicles and minivans dominated the crop of new vehicles. 
There were some great new cars, too, such as Volvo's new C70 coupe and convertible, and Chevrolet's high-powered Corvette. Here's our insider's look at the new vehicles and what they mean to consumers in the near future.</P>
<P><B>Sport Utility Vehicles:</B> We counted no less than four new entries into this ever-crowding market segment. Lincoln displayed the 1998 Navigator, which is just a dressed-up, more upscale version of Ford's new Expedition. Similarly, Infiniti showed its QX4, which is just a gussied-up version of parent company Nissan's Pathfinder. Although a Pathfinder in disguise, it was nonetheless a good disguise.
Another new sport ute that debuted in Detroit was Mitsubishi's Montero Sport. Despite it sharing the name of Mitsubishi's other SUV, the Montero Sport is a smaller, more nimble sport ute about the size of Chevy's Blazer. We liked its looks and clever details, such as storage compartments beneath the cargo area floor, but it's not expected to be the bargain of the sport utility market.</P>
<P>Our favorite new sport utility entry, however, was Dodge's 1998 Durango. Based on the wildly popular redesigned Dakota that was introduced earlier this year, the Durango is sized somewhere between a Blazer and Tahoe -- just as the Dakota is sized between compact and fullsize pickups. Durango wears the same tough looking fender bulges of both the Dakota and Ram Pickup and will offer two V8 engines. Durango will also offer a third row seat, like Expedition and Suburban. The problem is, Durango is considerably smaller than both those vehicles. With the third seat in place, cargo room is limited to a few bags of groceries, while passenger room in third seat is marginal. Trust us on this...we climbed back there ourselves. Nonetheless, Durango was the best looking new SUV at the show and it will go on sale later this year. With V8 power and macho good looks, we expect its sales to be robust.</P>
<P><B>Minivans:</B> For 1998, Toyota will drop its Previa and replace it with the Sienna. It's a more contemporary looking minivan, compared to the Twinkie-shaped Previa, but not a styling breakthrough. It's based on the new Camry and will be built in Kentucky. Also, it will feature a 194-horspower V6, which presumably will address the complaints that Previa was underpowered. Prices are expected to start at $30K.</P>
<P>GM's divisions Chevrolet, Pontiac and Oldsmobile showed their recently introduced minivans that replaced the slow selling, ugly, plastic-bodied Lumina, Trans Sport and Silhouette. These new vans, Chevy Venture, Pontiac Trans Sport and Olds Silhouette, feature steel bodies and thoroughly contemporary styling and performance. Each is powered by a 180-horsepower V6 and features a host of clever details, such as a net between the front seats to hold a purse or small bag and seats that fold and contort into seemingly endless variations. They also offer an optional driver's side sliding door. To say these vans are a vast improvement over their predecessors is a gross understatement. Overnight, GM's minivans went from also-rans to contenders for the best minivan.</P>
<P>As GM's minivans and Toyota's Sienna drew much deserved attention, Ford's redesigned 1998 Windstar was conspicuous by what it lacked: A driver's side sliding door. Chrysler started this popular trend with its 1996 minivans, and GM soon followed suit. Even the upcoming Sienna will offer a fourth door. Ford's research indicated a fourth door wouldn't be popular with customers. Their research was wrong. Because of where the fuel filler is located, Ford can't cost-effectively add a fourth door. For the time being, they've added a longer driver's door and folding driver's seat. They've called this stopgap measure the "Family Entry System"-- it's just not competitive with the four-doors.</P>
<P><B>Passenger Cars:</B> There were few new passenger cars unveiled in Detroit, but most were redesigns of existing models. Nevertheless, there were some notable introductions, including Ford's Escort ZX2 coupe. Based on the 1997 Escort introduced early in 1996, the ZX2 coupe ("Z" for the Zetec-named engine, "X" for the age group of targeted customers and "2" for two doors) wears sexier sheetmetal than the sedans and more power -- a 130-horsepower 4-cyl. Ford also showed off a facelifted version of the slow sellng Contour and its Mercury sibling, Mystique. It's hoped that the new noses will breathe some life these cars' sales. But, the reason they're slowing so poorly is because Ford sweetens the deal to lease Taurus, thereby hoping to keep the "Best Selling Car" title, but simultaneously making the Contour less of a good deal. It's a shame really, because the Contour and Mystique are fine, European-bred sedans.</P>
<P>From Chrysler came a look at the 1998 Dodge Intrepid and Chrysler Concorde. These vehicles advance the cab-forward look of the original LH cars, but appear somewhat generic looking. The new Concorde offers some sculpted styling, but the new Intrepid has a shape best descried as a half-baked blob of cookie dough. Both vehicles are expected to be powered by Chyrsler's new family of V6 engines.
Other passenger car unveilings included a redesigned 1998 Nissan Altima, which we hope will carry mechanical improvements more inspired than its styling. It will be a little roomier, however, which improves on an already roomy cabin. Also, Oldsmobile took the wraps off the Intrigue, an exquisite looking sedan that looks for all the world like a 7/8ths-scale Aurora. Sport sedan fans will be happy to learn that BMW will offer a four-door version of M3. We can hardly wait for that one.</P>
<P>There are some interesting new coupes on the horizon, too. Volvo and Mercedes-Benz unveiled the C70 and CLK, respectively. Each will go on sale later this year. Complicating matters for executives who don't know which upscale coupe is appropriate for taking on a power lunch, Jaguar displayed its tempting XK8 coupe. Decisions, decisions...
Sports cars: Without a doubt, the star of the Detroit Auto Show was Chevy's redesigned 1997 Corvette. Wearing all-new body, which covers and all-new chassis and engine, Corvette vaults to the head of the sports car class. The engine is a 345-horsepower, all-aluminum V8. Interestingly, the transmission isn't attached to the engine, but the rear axle. This arrangement provides vastly improved foot room inside. Also, there's now room in the cargo area for two large golf bags. The car's top speed is almost 175 mph, which means Corvette's 200-mph speedometer isn't just for looks. Oh yeah, the base price is $38K, placing it the bargain category of sports cars.</P>
<P>In all, Detroit's 1997 edition of the North American International Auto Show displayed more than 700 vehicles. After of week of pounding the show floor, we're exhausted, but excited about the new cars and trucks. We can't wait 'til next year.

<CENTER><H2>Mustang vs. Camaro: 30 Years of Pony Car Rivalry</H2></CENTER><P>


<P>When Ford Introduced the Mustang in the spring of 1964, it not only tapped a market hungry for an expressive, individualistic sporty car, it created an entirely new genre of vehicle -- the pony car. Named "pony" for Mustang's horse-moniker, the term came to stand for any two-door sport coupe with a long hood, short trunk and sexy lines stamped into its sheetmetal. The other domestic automakers were quick to respond; Chrysler countered with the Dodge Challenger and the Plymouth Barracuda, while American Motors quickly pushed the Javelin into production.</P><P>
At General Motors, concept drawings of a four-seater, sporty car were tacked to the company's design center walls before Mustang was introduced. With the unqualified success of Ford's pony car, plans were accelerated to push both Chevrolet and Pontiac versions into production. In the fall of 1966, the growing pony car field gained two more competitors: Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird. </P>
<P>To expedite production and keep the vehicles' prices down, it was decided that GM's pony cars would utilize as much "off the shelf" parts as possible. This meant the cars would borrow heavily from models already in production. In essence, the cars were based on Chevy's proven Nova platform. The idea of sourcing the vehicles from an existing product wasn't new -- Mustang was really a rebodied Ford Falcon.</P>
<P>Although Firebird has cultivated a loyal following over the years, it has really been Camaro that has galloped away with GM's pony car popularity. In the heyday of the Muscle Car, a rivalary developed between the camps of Mustang loyalists and legions of Camaro faithful. Machismo was measured by the engine size badge bolted to the cars' fenders, and whether it was performed on a sanctioned drag strip or between a couple of stop lights on Main Street, drivers of both cars have testing each other's mettle for 30 years now.
</P>
<P><B>Historic Anniversary</B><BR>

Nineteen ninety-seven marks the 30th anniversary of Camaro's introduction. Of course, Mustang is still around, but except for the Firebird, the rest of the cars' original muscle car dinosaur contemporaries are extinct. But, to survive doesn't necessarily mean to thrive. Both Mustang and Camaro have fallen in sales in recent years, thanks to consumers who have left sporty cars in favor of more practical modes of transport. Older consumers, for example, would rather haul antiques home in the back of an Explorer, rather than drag race between stoplights. Younger car buyers, however, tend to equate automotive excitement not with the sound of a burly V8 engine, but the inclusion of fog lamps and a rear spoiler on a compact four-door sedan.</P>
<P>Automotive tastes aside, both Mustang and Camaro have evolved into quite competent coupes. Both have been completely redesigned in recent years -- Camaro in 1993 and Mustang in 1994. They both offer the full complement of safety and convenience features that modern consumers demand, such as dual air bags, anti-lock brakes (optional on Mustang), cup holders, etc. In fact, Camaro even scored a 5-star rating in recent government crash tests -- the highest rating.
</P>
<P><B>Horsepower Ponies</B><BR>

Both cars also offer stirring performance. Mustang's 3.8-liter V6 and standard five-speed manual transmission combination provides 150 horsepower. A four-speed automatic is optional. As for Camaro, the base engine is 200-horsepower V6 and it's hooked to a 5-speed manual. Like Mustang, a 4-speed automatic is optional. At the stop light drags, Camaro's 200-horse V6 will easily edge the Mustang in performance. 
When you compare the performance variants of these two arch rivals, the results are more dramatic. Mustang GT's 215-horse V8 is simply no match for Camaro Z28's 285 horsepower. Also, Mustang GT's transmission is a five-speed, while Z28's is a fairly exotic six-speed. The extreme overdrive of Camaro's six-speed allows the Z28 to deliver 27 miles per gallon of highway driving. </P>
<P>Although Camaro may leave Mustang to suck exhaust fumes in a drag race, it's the Ford that is more compliant in everyday driving. Its seating position is more conventional, rather than the sports car-like, "on-the-floor" position of Camaro. Also, Mustang's conventional trunk is much more useful for everyday needs, such as groceries and luggage. At 10.9 cu. ft., the dimensions of Mustang's trunk are less than Camaro's 12.9 cu. ft., but they're wholly usable in the Ford. Mustang also has a back seat pass-through feature for long items, such as skis. 
</P>
<P><B>Sport Coupe Value</B><BR>

As for ride and handling, the nod also goes to Mustang for everyday driving. Both cars utilize a comparatively low-tech solid rear axle, but Mustang's refined "quad-shock" system is better adept to soaking up road imperfections. But, for those who really like to drive, Camaro's combination of a high-horsepower and rear-wheel drive will put a grin on the face of anyone who plants his or her foot on the accelerator while exiting a tight turn. Just make sure both hands are on the steering wheel.
As both vehicles are aimed at buyers who see their cars as a reflection of their personality, rather than mere transportation conveyance, both are well equipped with powerful audio systems, smart good looks. Camaro does offer a few extras, such as air conditioning, standard cassette player, four cup holders. Although Mustang's $15,888 base price is less than Camaro's $16,740, the cost of adding these features pushes the bottom line well past Camaro (don't forget Mustang's anti-lock brakes are optional, too). In pure economic terms, Camaro is the better value than Mustang. But, for those who desire more conventional uses for their sports coupe, the Mustang may be the way to go. </P>
<P>Both Mustang and Camaro have seen competitors come and go. Both have survived more than 30 years of gas crunches, changing automotive tastes and design trends. That both of them have remained true to their mission of providing affordable sports car style is a good indication that they'll weather the fickle tastes of consumers and renew their rivalry for years to come.</P>

<TR><TD ROWSPAN=10 VALIGN=TOP><IMG WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=35 ALT="Answers" SRC="gfx/answers.gif"><P></TD>
<TD><A NAME="d1"><P>The Nissan 300ZX will not be sold in the U.S. after 1996. We asked a representative at Nissan why they had decided to eliminate this roomy sports coupe and they cited prohibitively steep costs due to increasingly stringent emissions standards, as well as a shrinking market for this kind of car. They pointed out that in 1980 7,000 units were sold, whereas in the past year less than 6,000 units were delivered--so its popularity with the American consumer was waning slightly. They did not cite a new Nissan model that was meant to "replace" the somewhat cumbersome--for a 2-door sports coupe--300ZX.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="d2"><P>There aren't any national factory-sponsored lease incentives planned for the ES300 currently.  Lexus claims that any plans for future lease incentives were strictly confidential.  Commonly, manufacturers don't let the dealers or customers know about incentives until the day they are actually going to announce it.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="d3"><P>Mercedes will have brochures and information on the M-Class SUV -- their first stab at an all-activity vehicle-- available by September or October of 1997. If you call 1-800-For-Mercedes they will put you on a mailing list to receive all updated info. Currently, they have little information, not even a photo! This new SUV is slated to arrive at dealers in late Fall (early November) of 1997. The M-Class is still being conceptually refined, and they are still tinkering with their model. That tailgate that you initially spottedwith integral tire/tool kit/speakers--has been abandoned. This earlier model was originally displayed at major car shows last fall, but Mercedes claims that it was changed due to a less-than-enthusiastic public response, and the spare tire will now be stored underneath-- giving the tailgate a smoother look (without the projection of the tire visible).The spokesperson we talked to didn't know whether the speakers and tool kit were still integrated in that backgate. The recent Car and Driver photo you spotted registers their newer vision and they expect only minor refinements at this point before release.</P>
<P>Like all 1997-1998 Mercedes this SUV will include side air bags. It's important to remember that when you see these prototypes represented in the car magazines they may or may not look like the actual car that will appear in showrooms later--something you like or hate may be refined out of the model.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="d4"><P>We received conflicting answers from Ford. One representative indicated that your dealer was correct and the engine you thought you were getting was initially slated to come standard in this vehicle, but Ford has had problems getting it from the manufacturer and they have replaced it. This Ford spokesperson said the version you ordered now comes standard with an electrical fuel-injection V-6 4.0 liter OHV. In addition, there is no longer any such thing as the "945A PEP", that package is now called the 945B. When you order a 945B you can get this SOHC engine--but only as an option. One representative said that it was readily available as an option, but another told me that you could run into problems with delays, and that you should check with your dealer to see how long you would have to wait.</P>

<P>Still, another representative claimed that the 1997 brochure describing the 945A PEP with that SOHC engine was simply a misprint, and that the package was never supposed to include that engine standard. The 945A should have been termed the 945B, which gives the OHV standard, with the SOHC powertrain as an option. In either case, if you want that engine you will have to order it as an option, and you should check with your dealer about when you could actually get it. You can call Ford at 1-800-392-3673 if you have further questions. It doesn't seem quite right that you ordered a vehicle based on misinformation, or a misprint, in Ford's brochure.</P></TD></TR>



<TR><TD><A NAME="b8"><P>Several weeks ago we replied to a similar question, and when we spoke to the public relations people at Dodge they told us Dodge was "thinking" about developing an SUV in the Tahoe/Expedition class, but that it was still in the "thinking" stage and would be a couple of years off. Now they seem to have more firm information and this "rumor" has been upgraded to a "plan." Dodge now says they are developing an SUV based on the Ram-series platform for 1998. They have no specs. on this vehicle, and are not releasing any info on it right now. Although there is no definite release date, the schedule is for its appearance in the '98 year, and they should have more info at the end of 1997. You can call Dodge at 1-800-423-6343 next year to get more specific info--but it sounds like they are committed to this vehicle sometime in the near and foreseeable future.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="b9"><P>Without knowing the exact specifics of your leasing deal, it's fair to assume that it's going to the dealer. It sounds like a fee the dealer has tacked on that purportedly covers his administrative overhead (and perhaps we can safely term it dealer "profit"). We've seen a similar kind of fee in a leasing deal termed a "start-up cost" which supposedly covered the labor and cost to the dealer in obtaining tax/titles/licensing etc. When this fee was investigated it amounted to quite a tidy little profit to the dealer--imagine if you add a $150-$600 fee for cars and you lease/sell about 200 cars per month--that's a nice little bonus.  </P>
<P>In some states, there are very stringent consumer protection laws that prohibit excessive administrative fees whether you're talking about an auto lease or a purchase--you could check with a consumer action group to check your particular state. The reason we think it's fair to assume that it's not going to the credit corporation is that that kind of fee is generally built into the flat monthly rate you're paying, and they've usually built their administrative costs into that figure. If you want to investigate you could call your credit company and ask them if that fee is going to them or the dealer. It's a good idea to look at the extra fees and charges on a leasing deal and ask a lot of questions--they'll advertise a low leasing fee, but then add on so many fees and extras that you're not getting a deal at all.</P>
</TD></TR>


<TR><TD><A NAME="b4"><P>I waited to answer your question because Mitsubishi had no product info on
the new '97 Montero SR this summer. When I called on Oct. 8th they still
had no specs, even though they are due to be released to dealers any
day...at least by the end of October. They did say  that most changes are
minor and mainly cosmetic. For example, the look of the grille and flares
is slightly modified, and there will be a hard shell cover on the spare
tire. One representative assured me there would certainly be new colors,
while another told me that only the same 8 existing colors would return for
'97, and a dealer seconded that.</P>

<P>The biggest change for '97 will be that the SR will have a slightly smaller
engine (for better fuel economy): in '96 the SR was powered by a 3.5 liter
214 hp V-6, but standard on both the LS and SR this year will be a 3.5
liter 24-valve 195 hp V-6. Other changes include standard leather seating
on the SR (it was optional in '96); a new premium Infiniti sound system
(am/fm/cassette/CD/8 speakers) standard on the SR (optional last year); new
tinted rear privacy glass, and optional heated front seats. There are also
a variety of package options (4) for '97 including the "LS Preferred
Equipment Package" (standard on the SR), featuring a third row of seats, a
sliding rear quarter window, power sunroof, and the tinted rear window.
There is also an "All-Weather" package available on either the SR or LS
that includes anti-lock brakes, heated front seats, and three-way
adjustable shock absorbers. In addition there is a "Value Package" for the
LS or SR that includes a whole lot of extras from air conditioning to
keyless entry system.  The Montero seats seven people comfortably.  Aside
from the slightly more economical engine, the changes may not be major
enough for you to pay '97 prices.</P>

<P>Ford, as you know, intoduces the all-new Expedition this '97 model year --
a full-size SUV with four doors, 4-wheel antilock brakes (ABS), dual
airbags, a choice of 2WD or 4WD, and either a 215 hp V-8 or a new 230 hp
V-8. Ford claims that this is a nine- passenger utility vehicle that will
still fit easily into standard garages, and that offers "best in class
towing, payload, and highway fuel economy." The Expedition is derived from
the 1997 Ford F-150 pickup platform (the best-selling car in the country)
and shares half its components with the '97 F-Series vehicles. The
Expedition is about 5 inches longer than its leading competitors (119 inch
wheelbase), with an available third row of seats, and a roomy second row
--so it's certainly spacious enough for your needs.With the second-row seat
folded, and the third row seat removed it offers 115 cubic feet of cargo
space, and it can tow 8,000 pounds. It should be priced somewhere around
$28,000.</P>

<P>Because SUV's are so hot right now--they represent the fastest growing
segment of the auto industry--there are, and will continue to be, more
choices at every size and price level. For instance, Dodge is developing a
larger SUV for '98.  In the full-size SUV class for '97 there is also the
Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon (which really fits about six people) that comes
with dual airbags, a choice of 2- or 4- wheel drive, and two different
V-8's. The Chevy Suburban, which is longer than the Tahoe/Yukon, has dual
air bags, and a new power-steering system for '97. Chevrolet assured me
that the Suburban fits 9 people and their ski equipment quite
comfortably--it's huge. You could also consider the Toyota Landcruiser
which can fit 7-8 adults, or the Range Rover, which, in certain
configurations, fits seven.  Jeeps and Troopers are designed for only 5
adults.</P>

<P>In general, these big, powerful full-sized SUV's come with equally large
pricetags...$22,000 and up. You might want to comparison shop between the
'96 Montero and the all-new '97 Expedition.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="b5"><P>You're absolutely right , there was a stoppage on the power sunroof option
on the Blazer for about 2-4 weeks. However, Chevrolet assured me that as of
July '96 that option was officially available. Currently, it should
available as a standard option at your Chevrolet dealer now.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="b6"><P>The big re-vamping and re-designing of the Saab 9000 series is slated for
1998, so you won't be getting a very different car if you buy a '97 instead
of the '96. However, you may experience that feeling of regret one year
later. The Saab representative told me that the re-design of the 1998 will
be comparable to the new look that Saab introduced to the 900 back in 1994.
Some minor changes from '96 to '97 include new brake pads, with larger,
more powerful discs and calipers to provide better braking, and new velour
seat material. In general, it's pretty much the same. They don't have
specific info on the big changes for '98, but it includes a major
re-styling and a body change. That new 9000 series will be available in
Europe in 1997, but won't be released here until 1998--originally it was
planned for the US market in mid-1997. Saab said to check back with them in
mid-1997, around August or September. You can reach them at 1-800-582-7222.</P></TD></TR>


<TR><TD><A NAME="b7"><P>BMW still has customers on a waiting list for brochures and info on the '97
3-Series, and had some, but very little information. These cars are in
production and are due--roughly--at the dealers in November. They had no
specific info on the 3-series and the specific refinements for '97 (or more
particularly the 328i you've ordered), but did say that all BMW's this
model year would have an all-season traction system standard (before it was
optional on many) and as of October 1st all BMW's will have a scheduled
maintenance program for the first 3 years or 36,000 miles, which gives you
no-cost scheduled maintenance-- not including parts.</P>

<P>The manufacturer's suggested retail prices for the 328's are as follows:
the 328i (4 door) is $32,900, the 328 (2-door coupe) is $32,990, and the
328i convertible is $41,390. You should call BMW at 1-800-334-4269 to get
on a mailing list so that you can get the specifics as soon as possible. In
general, the European and Japanese car manufacturers tend to receive (or
hold back) information on new models much later than their American
counterparts. It makes it very frustrating, because the materials will
often come right before the actual vehicles get delivered to dealers.</P></TD></TR>

<P>Here are two questions I've been trying to find answers to with little success:</P>
<P>1. 	Does Ford have any plans for offering a 3rd door option on the Ranger (similar to what's already available on GM's small pickups?)<BR>

2. 	When can we expect to see the new Volvo 850 Coupe at dealers? <BR>

Any information would be greatly appreciated!<BR>

--Frank Aquilo

<P><I>According to our sources, Ford does indeed intend to offer a third door on the extended cab Ranger in the near future. Expect to see this more "family-friendly" truck in the 1998 model year.</P>
<P>Though we received some conflicting information on the Volvo 850 Coupe's arrival, it's safe to say that this vehicle will hit dealer lots sometime in late Spring '97. --Editor (6/21/96)</I></P>

<P>I saw your information for the first time and liked it very much. Am wondering if you have a tip for a truck buyer in Florida who purchased a used truck which turned out to be a wrecked truck from out of state. The dealer refuses to correct the title and will not refund the full $3,500 he allowed on a Firebird trade in. The  buyer's attorney has used up over $800 with zero progress. The latest dealer offer: Take back the truck (which has been upgraded due to a number of problems) and $2,000. I've bookmarked your page and will check it for valuable updates.
Keep up the good work.<BR>

<P>I find your articles very informative both for the consumer and the retailer. However, I also find that your rebate information is not completely accurate, especially for California. For example, you list the 1995 1/2 Isuzu Rodeo with a $2,300 or $2,000 dealer incentive. I have a different figure.<BR>

--Dave Langer</P>





<P><I>The figures we had listed for the Rodeo were incorrect. We apologize. Additionally, most manufacturers make it somewhat difficult to obtain dealer incentive information. We do our best to get it right. Please feel free to contact us again with any oversights. Thanks. Editor <BR>

<H2> Big Incentives from Auto Manufacturers</H2><p></CENTER>

<I>Manufacturers are trying to entice buyer's with big incentives.</I><p>

<CENTER><A HREF="custin.html">Direct Link To Incentives</A></CENTER><BR>


<P>Both Ford and Chrysler recently announced significant customers incentives, a move which caused some automotive pundits to wonder whether a price war is in the offing. Whether or not this is the case matters little to the consumer--all that really matters are that manufacturers are giving buyers ways to save significantly on the purchase of their new cars.</P>



<P>
Here's a general outline of the differences between customer and dealer incentives:</P>




<P><A HREF="custin.html#customer">Customer incentives</A> are a key way manufacturers give dealers lee-way when it comes to making a sale. The idea is to give the customer a "bonus" for buying a particular brand or model. Such incentive or rebate programs are constantly changing and are affected significantly by the time of year or how a vehicle is selling. You can be sure that models with significant body changes in 1996 will also have significant rebates tied to them.</P>



<P><A HREF="custin.html#dealer">
Dealer incentives</A>  are another way manufacturers help dealers cope with unwanted stock. Dealer incentives are basically a creative way for manufacturers to motivate salespeople to sell their cars. Dealers are under no obligation to reveal this "spiff" to their customers, so the only way you can find out about them is by doing some serious research on your own, or visiting the AutoMarket Report on a regular basis. Knowing current dealer incentives can give you an upper-hand at the bargaining table. Though the dealer incentive programs are not as extensive as the customer incentives currently available, it's still worth checking them out.</P>



<P>
If you're after a good deal on a new car--and you don't mind forgoing the very latest model--now's the time to buy. And, don't forget, you <I> will </I> be buying a new car, so the factory warranty will still be in effect. 
</P>

<CENTER><H2>Invoice Pricing</H2></CENTER><p>



Looking through the Sunday paper, you see ads for cars touting the bargain slogan: "At Dealer Invoice"--implying that this is lowest price you're ever going to find on that new car you're dreaming of. But, as we pointed out in an article outlining current <A HREF="custin.html">incentives/rebates</A> , there is definitely more room at the bargaining table than those ads let on. In fact, if you look at the fine print, you'll probably see a disclaimer that reads something like: "Invoice is not necessarily net cost to dealer."<p>

Still, knowing the invoice price does give you the upper hand. Since the
Weekly AutoMarket Report doesn't have a database of such information, we
recommend you visit <A HREF="http://www.edmunds.com">Edmund's Automobile Buyer's </A>Guide for a complete,
comprehensive and FREE listing of every model car or truck you can think of.
Check it out.<p>

If you're in the market for a car, search through this listing to find if any dealer or customer incentives are being offered for the car you want.<P>

<UL><DT>
<H4>Please Note: We make every attempt to keep the incentive lists up to date, however the market changes rapidly and some regional programs will not be included here. (Incentives in California, for instance, can be dramatically different from the incentives being offered nationally).<BR>
Additionally, manufacturers can add/change incentives in a matter of moments by sending out an announcement to all franchises via fax.<BR>

These incentives are only available in the U.S., we don't currently offer a Canadian list.</H4></DT>

<CENTER><P><B>Auto-By-Tel Brings Car Buying Revolution to the Super Bowl</B></P>

<P><I>First  Internet company to air commercial on Super Bowl</I></P>
</CENTER>



<P><B>Irvine, CA,</B> December 16, 1996 - Auto-By-Tel, the online automobile
purchasing program, proves that Internet commerce is here to stay.  The
company is making history as the first Internet business to advertise on
the Super Bowl.  Leonard Nimoy will provide the voice over for the thirty
second animated spot scheduled to air during the second quarter of Super
Bowl XXXI.  Taking a straight shot at traditional car-buying, the
commercial will illustrate how the Auto-By-Tel process has changed
car-buying forever.</P>

<P>"Auto-By-Tel makes the consumer the champion in the car-buying process --
what better place to start our national broadcast campaign than on the
world's best known championship game?" said Peter Ellis, the company's
President and CEO, of Auto-By-Tel's decision to enter this high stakes
advertising market.  "Auto-By-Tel's appearance on the Super Bowl is a clear
indication that Internet commerce has come of age."</P>

<P>When the Internet was taking its baby steps, Ellis, a former car-dealer,
bought his first computer.  After two decades as one of California's (and
the country's) leading automotive retailers, Ellis had a visionary idea:
to put control of the automobile purchasing process in the hands of the
consumer.  Operating out of a tiny office in Corona del Mar with only four
employees, Ellis took Auto-By-Tel online.  Within a week, Auto-By-Tel
received 2,000 new car Purchase Requests.  Twenty-one months later,
Purchase Requests have exceeded 350,000.  Auto-By-Tel, in existence for
less than two years, has revolutionized the car-selling industry and, in
the process, has helped legitimize the Internet as a serious marketplace.
</P>
<P>Auto-By-Tel's success epitomizes the Internet's appeal as a
consumer-friendly medium that empowers users through vast information
resources and expedient transactions.  With its low-cost, no-haggle
program, Auto-By-Tel quickly hit a nerve with the car-buying public.
Exhibiting a growth rate extraordinary even by the Internet's standards --
Purchase Requests have increased over 500% in the last year alone --
Auto-By-Tel has become a serious force to contend with in the $600 billion
per year new/used car retailing industry.
</P>
<P>According to a recent article in Advertising Age, one in five consumers in
the market for a new or used car goes online.  "We believe that after the
huge Super Bowl audience sees what a difference Auto-By-Tel can make in the
car-buying process, that figure is going to change dramatically," says
Betsy Isroelit of RBI Communications, Inc., agency for Auto-By-Tel.</P>

<P>The Auto-By-Tel spot, animated by Playhouse Pictures using digital ink and
paint and  three dimension EFX, will air January 26th, 1997 during the
second quarter of the Super Bowl (Fox Network).  Creative content of the
commercial will not be revealed prior to air date, but, says RBI Creative
Director Ron Isroelit, "We believe when people look back on the 1997 Super
Bowl commercials and pinpoint the companies that were the most visionary,
Auto-By-Tel will top the list.  Just as Apple's famous 1984 commercial,
which premiered during the Super Bowl, foretold the advent of user-friendly
computers, we believe Auto-By-Tel's Super Bowl commercial is poised to
foretell a strikingly similar revolution in car buying."</P>

<P>The Auto-By-Tel Super Bowl production team is headed by RBI's Creative
Directors Ron and Betsy Isroelit.  The commercial will be directed by Gerry
Woolery at Playhouse Pictures' Hollywood studio.  Art direction is by John
Thompson, and Drew Gentle and noted arranger and conductor Buddy Freed
serves as musical director.</P>

<P>Auto-By-Tel Corporation runs the leading online automotive purchasing
program, having processed in excess of 350,000 Purchase Requests to date.
The company believes it has one of the largest commercial websites,
accounting for a substantial volume of Internet-based commerce.  There are
over 1,500 participating dealers servicing consumers in the U.S. and
Canada.  All must maintain high CSIs (customer satisfaction index) and are
constantly evaluated by the consumer.  The program is available on the
Internet at www.autobytel.com  or on any of the major online services and
can be used by U.S. and Canadian residents.</P>

<P>Playhouse Pictures was established in 1952 and has remained on the cutting
edge of animation ever since.  Producers of over 3,500 commercials and
short subject films, Playhouse has won every national animation award,
including an Emmy and the coveted Venice Cup.  Playhouse was instrumental
in the development of animation for television in its early days, and, more
recently, pioneered the use of digital ink and paint in national
commercials.</P>

<P>RBI Communications, Inc., established in 1988, is a leader in the hot new
field of Internet advertising, public relations and website creation and
management.  With offices and production facilities on both east and west
coasts and clients throughout the country, the Hollywood-based firm
operates as a full-service advertising and public relations agency
specializing in Internet and retail clients.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>Auto-By-Tel, the Internet's Premier Automotive Purchasing Program,<BR>
Maintains Dominance with New Services</B></P>

<P>Online Financing and Used Car Cyberstore Top the List of New Services<BR>
Announced at the First-Ever Auto-By-Tel Satellite Summit.</P></CENTER>

<P><B>Irvine, CA</B>,  October 31, 1996 - A number of new and innovative services
announced at the first-ever Auto-By-Tel Satellite Summit give consumers the
power to perform every aspect of the car-buying process online.
Announcements made via satellite to Auto-By-Tel's Subscribing Dealers
included the introduction of low-cost online financing through an exclusive
Internet relationship with Chase Auto Finance; online leasing through GE
Capital Auto Financial Services; the formation of a Used Car Cyberstore;
and the implementation of a high-tech Real-Time communications system.
This means that in addition to low-cost new-car buying and auto insurance
through AIG, consumers now have easy access to online financing and
low-cost used-car buying.</P>

<P>"Auto-By-Tel's goal is to ensure that our Subscribing Dealers lead the pack
in today's rapidly changing automotive marketplace by providing consumers
with low-cost, pain-relieving car buying," said Pete Ellis, Auto-By-Tel's
President and CEO.  "The programs announced at the Satellite Summit place
our dealers firmly on the cutting-edge of the automotive revolution."</P>

<P>Speaker Michael Fuchs, former Chairman and CEO of Home Box Office (HBO),
equated "Auto-By-Tel's position in the automotive industry to HBO's
unprecedented success in cable television.  Fuchs declared, "The automobile
business is being revolutionized and Auto-By-Tel is the HBO of that
revolution."</P>

<P>Addressing that change, James David Power III, founder of J.D. Power and
Associates, told the ABT Subscribing Dealers in attendance that the most
recent J.D. Power study of new vehicle buyers in the U.S. found that 68%
have and use computers.  The same study revealed that high-income
households account for 55% of new vehicle sales, a number that's expected
to reach 66% in the year 2000.  Since high-income households typically own
computers,
Power concluded that "Auto-By-Tel Dealers have the tiger by the tail."</P>

<P>Auto-By-Tel's success is based on two general principles: (1) giving
consumers an easy and painless way to purchase and finance a new or used
vehicle at a low cost; and (2) providing ABT Subscribing Dealers with the
tools necessary to compete in today's rapidly changing automotive industry
by substantially lowering their cost of doing business.</P>

<P>Auto-By-Tel engaged high-tech methods-a closed-circuit interactive
conference beamed to 47 locations across the U.S. and Canada via
satellite-to discuss its future plans with Subscribing Dealers.  Highlights
of the new services include:</P>
<P><B>Auto-By-Tel Acceptance Corporation (ABTAC)</B><BR>

ABTAC, Auto-By-Tel's new financing subsidiary, will introduce online
leasing through GE Capital Auto Financial Services as well as online
financing through Chase Auto Finance beginning next year.  Auto-By-Tel
customers will now be able to complete applications for financing online
and, ultimately, receive a response within minutes.</P>

<P>Sandy Derickson, President of GE Capital Auto Financial Services, told ABT
Dealers, "Today's car buyers are the most informed consumers ever.  We
believe Auto-By-Tel has designed a powerful marketing system on the
Internet that will bring modern car buyers directly to your sales desk."</P>

<P>Chase Auto Finance's automotive online financing is offered exclusively
through the Auto-By-Tel website and Auto-By-Tel dealers.  Jim Brew,
President of Chase Auto Finance, said, "Chase is delighted to have the
opportunity to work with ABTAC and its dealers to take the lead in
providing Internet-based automotive financial services to this large and
fast-growing market."</P>

<P>Used Car Cyberstore to Offer Largest Inventory of Used Vehicles
Auto-By-Tel will implement the largest and most comprehensive online
used-car network during the first quarter of 1997.  Auto-By-Tel's Used Car
Cyberstore will outdistance today's used car superstores, namely CarMax and
AutoNation, in terms of volume and number of easily accessible locations.
The program will be exclusively available to members of Auto-By-Tel's
new-car Subscribing Dealers.</P>

<P>"The ABT Subscribing Dealers will form the single largest network of used
car centers in the world and will offer hundreds of thousands of certified,
quality used vehicles to millions of consumers across the U.S. and Canada,"
said John Honiotes, National Sales Director.</P>

<P><B>Dealer Real-Time Communication System</B><BR>

Availability of new technology will enable the real-time processing of
Auto-By-Tel Purchase/Lease Requests by Subscribing Dealers.  Dealers that
adopt the Real Time system will be informed of a Purchase/Lease Request the
moment the consumer submits it, translating into better customer service
and potentially more sales.</P>

<P>Auto-By-Tel Corporation runs the leading online automotive purchasing
program, having processed in excess of 300,000 Purchase Requests to date.
The company believes it has one of the largest commercial Websites,
accounting for a substantial volume of Internet-based commerce.  There are
over 1,400 participating dealers servicing consumers in the U.S. and
Canada.  All must maintain high CSIs and are constantly evaluated by the
consumer.  The program is available on the Internet at
http://www.autobytel.com or on any of the major online services and can be
used by U.S. and Canadian residents (in English and French).</P>

<CENTER><P><B>No-Hassle, No-Haggle Car Buying on the Internet</B></P></CENTER>

<P><B>Toronto, Ontario</B>, September 30, 1996 - 	Arlene Johnson was tired of car shopping. Visiting dealer after dealer in an attempt to negotiate a fair price on a new car had left a bad taste in her mouth. In fact, she was ready to give up when her sister Sheryl found Auto-By-Tel, an automotive purchasing program, on the Internet.  Sheryl didn't know what to expect, but she knew she couldn't lose by filling out Auto-By-Tel's Purchase/Lease Request form.  </P>
<P>	When the participating ABT dealer called, she was pleasantly surprised with the great price he quoted her on a new Hyundai Accent. Not only did using Auto-By-Tel save her sister a lot of money, but, perhaps even more importantly, Sheryl helped Arlene save a tremendous amount of time and trouble. </P>
<P>	Explains Sheryl, a business analyst, "The process was easy, quick, and very user friendly.  The Auto-By-Tel dealer did not try to sell Arlene up to a more expensive vehicle.  Not only did she get all the features she wanted at the price she wanted to pay, but she got more--including a sunroof and automatic transmission.  There was no pressure and the whole deal was handled over the telephone."  </P>
<P>	Arlene couldn't be happier about her first-car purchase, "The price I got was fantastic and the process was so easy. You just sit at home and put through a Request on your own time without visiting a dealership. "</P>
<P>	Already a huge success in the U.S., Auto-By-Tel recently began serving Canadian car buyers with its revolutionary program.  The program is easy to use. First, Auto-By-Tel customers are encouraged to research their vehicle of choice using a variety of sources, including new car magazines and the wealth of automotive information available on the Internet (several of which can be accessed through Auto-By-Tel's Website at http://www.autobytel.com). Users then submit a Purchase/Lease Request to Auto-By-Tel which is sent to a local Participating Dealer who follows up within forty-eight hours with low, competitive pricing. There is no negotiating or haggling. The program costs consumers absolutely nothing, and can save them thousands of dollars.</P> 
<P>	Dealers are able to offer Auto-By-Tel customers low pricing because the costs of selling a car through Auto-By-Tel, in terms of advertising and overhead, is far less than via traditional means. Geoff White, business manager of Toronto's Ken Shaw Lexus Toyota, explains, "Auto-By-Tel customers have already done their research and all they want is a fair deal--which we can give them because we know we're not going to have to spend hours with them. From our point of view it's a lovely way of doing business and most of the Auto-By-Tel customers we've talked to are just totally enthralled with the whole process." </P>
<P>	You don't have to be "high tech" to use the Auto-By-Tel Program.  "The Website is 'point and click' with easy-to-use icons," says Sheryl Johnson.  "My parents will be looking for new cars in the near future and I'll definitely suggest they try Auto-By-Tel. They are by no means computer experts." </P>
<P>	"We've discovered that today's consumer has a wealth of information available to him," says Pete Ellis, Auto-By-Tel's President and CEO. "He doesn't want to get the run-around, he just wants to buy a car at an affordable price." Ellis attributes much of ABT's success to a dealer training program that teaches dealers how to reinvent themselves for the customer of the information age.</P>
<P>	According to statistics, Canada is an Internet-savvy country. As Trevor Boquist, General Sales Manager of Applewood Chevrolet Olds, an ABT Dealer, explains, "Canada has grabbed hold of the Internet as a means of communications. People are already ordering groceries on the computer. With Auto-By-Tel they can order cars via computer. </P> 
<P>	"I think the Internet is going to become a way of life for us." Boquist continues. "It's just an easier way to do business--it's straightforward and there's no hassle. Of course, there will always have to be the human touch to provide the service and the delivery of the product, making it a win-win situation for everyone." </P>
<P>	To buy your next car over the Internet, point your Internet browser to http://www.autobytel.com, or look for Auto-by-Tel on CompuServe, Prodigy and America Online.</P>

<B>AUTO-BY-TEL CHOOSES AIG PROGRAM TO MARKET<BR> LOW-COST 
AUTO INSURANCE VIA THE INTERNET</B></P></CENTER>


<P>
<I>Relationship provides consumers with a one-stop shopping solution for low-cost car buying and low-cost auto insurance.
</I></P>
<P><B>Corona del Mar, CA</B>, August 13, 1996 - Auto-By-Tel Corporation (ABT) and American International Group, Inc. (AIG) have joined forces to create a one-stop shopping solution for low-cost car buying and low-cost auto insurance.  When consumers visit the Auto-By-Tel Website (www.autobytel.com) to purchase a new car or truck via ABT's successful automotive program, they can also request a quote for auto insurance from member companies of AIG, the leading U.S.-based international insurance organization.</P>

<P>"In addition to its financial strength and sound underwriting policies, one of AIG's greatest strengths is its ability to respond quickly to changing customer needs. AIG's ability to deliver auto insurance buyers superior value for their auto insurance dollar makes it a perfect partner for Auto-By-Tel," said Peter Ellis, ABT's President and CEO.  "AIG's low-cost auto insurance program is right in line with Auto-By-Tel's mission to make the car-buying experience as painless and affordable as possible."</P>

</P>
<P>To ensure Auto-By-Tel customers receive top-notch service and attention, AIG Marketing, Inc. has implemented a dedicated toll-free 800 number for the Auto-By-Tel Website.  Because quote requests are facilitated by in-house customer service representatives, the company can pass savings onto its customers.  AIG's state-of-the-art policywriting and quoting system provides qualified applicants a low-cost quote quickly and efficiently.  The service is available in most of the United States.</P>



<P>"We've watched Auto-By-Tel's success in this emerging marketplace with great interest," said Ernie Hansen, President of AIG Marketing, Inc., AIG's personal lines direct marketing subsidiary.  "As the Internet automotive market has taken shape, AIG began investigating how and where it could market personal auto insurance to online customers.  After reviewing the options, it was clear that Auto-By-Tel's Website offered the best platform to direct market AIG's personal lines auto insurance."</P>

<P>Auto-By-Tel Corporation runs the leading online automotive purchasing program, having processed in excess of 200,000 Purchase Requests to date. The company believes it has one of the largest commercial Websites, accounting for a substantial volume of internet-based commerce. The program is available on the Internet at http://www.autobytel.com or on any of the major online services and can be used by U.S. and Canadian residents.

<CENTER><P><B>Auto-By-Tel Open for Business in Canada!</B><BR>

<I>The revolutionary Internet-based automotive purchasing program is now available to Canadian auto dealers and consumers.</I> 
</P></CENTER>
<P><B>Corona del Mar, CA</B>, May 22, 1996 - The automotive program that revolutionized the car-buying experience in the United States is now available in Canada.  Auto-By-Tel, an Internet-based company, refers customers to its network of 1,400 U.S.-based dealers that are dedicated to offering low, competitive pricing on new cars and trucks.  Auto-By-Tel has been in business since March 1995 and has literally changed the landscape of new-car purchasing.</P>  
<P>Numerous forward-thinking Canadian automotive dealers have signed onto the Auto-By-Tel program, and Auto-By-Tel's Canadian users have already given the program rave reviews.  Toronto-resident Sheryl Johnson exclaims, "I was totally impressed.  The Auto-By-Tel Dealer did not try to sell me up to a more expensive vehicle.  Not only did I get all the features I wanted at the price I wanted to pay, but I also got more-including a sunroof and automatic transmission.  There was no pressure and the whole deal was handled over the telephone.  My parents are looking for a new car-I'll be sure they use the Auto-By-Tel program!"</P>
<P>U.S. users have cast their votes by submitting over 100,000 new-car purchase/lease requests in Auto-By-Tel's first year of business. Not only have U.S. consumers embraced this cutting-edge process for purchasing new cars and trucks at no-haggle prices, but U.S. auto dealers have also benefited from the program's focus on the expanding techno-savvy market.</P>
<P>In founding the Auto-By-Tel program, Peter Ellis has hit on the pulse of the current revolution to revamp the automotive sales industry.  According to Ellis, "The success of Auto-By-Tel illustrates that U.S. consumers are tired of the traditional car-buying experience.  What 
we've discovered is that today's consumer has a wealth of information available to him-including invoice pricing, current rebates, etc.-he doesn't want to get the runaround, he just wants to buy a car at an affordable price.  Dealers have been selling cars the same way for over 75 years, and Auto-By-Tel is focused on training dealers how to reinvent themselves for the customer of the next century." Ellis continues, "Our first year of business in the U.S. was one of rapid expansion-consumer demand for the ABT program accelerated faster than we originally anticipated.  With that in mind, we're positioned to meet a similar demand from value-conscious Canadian consumers."</P>
<P>A recent automotive industry report* credits Auto-By-Tel's success with high-volume selling and low operating and marketing costs. The report goes on to state that "technology will play a pivotal role in separating car retailing winners from losers over the years ahead" and suggested that "franchised dealers that wish to survive will advertise on the Internet and embrace a low-cost business model to compete more effectively on price, as advocated by Auto-By-Tel." </P>
<P>The Auto-By-Tel program is simple to use. First, consumers are encouraged to research their vehicle of choice by using whatever means are at their disposal - sources on the Internet, new-car magazines, etc.  Then, users submit a purchase/lease request to Auto-By-Tel (located at www.autobytel.com on the Internet) which is sent to a Subscribing Dealer who follows up within forty-eight hours with low, competitive pricing.  The program costs the consumer absolutely nothing and can save him thousands of dollars.</P>
<P>Additionally, Auto-By-Tel has attracted the attention of over 200 high-visibility magazines, newspapers and television networks, including NBC Nightly News, CNN, Fortune Magazine, BusinessWeek Magazine, U.S. News & World Report, Time Magazine and the New York Times.
Anyone with a computer and modem can access Auto-By-Tel.  Just set your Internet browser to http://www.autobytel.com or access Auto-By-Tel on any of the major online services, including Prodigy, CompuServe and America Online.  Auto-By-Tel Canada is in the process of reviewing applications from high-quality, service-oriented dealers that qualify to be Subscribing Dealers.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>Women Find Their Dream Cars on the Internet <BR>
and Leave the Nightmare of Car Shopping Behind</B></P></CENTER>



<P><B>Corona del Mar, CA</B>, April 24, 1996 - Debbie Knorr didn't know what to expect when she submitted her request for a new car using Auto-By-Tel, an automotive program on the Internet. What she got was a great deal on a new Dodge Stratus while saving a tremendous amount of time and trouble using Auto-By-Tel's no-haggle, no-hassle, money-saving program.</P>
<P>"Auto-By-Tel is the way of the future," explains Debbie. "Thirty-something baby-boomers are intelligent and well-informed. We don't want the hassle of dealing with the traditional unscrupulous car salesperson. And, with full-time careers and families, we don't have time to shop around."</P>
<P>Buying a car can be extremely daunting for just about anyone.  It's not only one of the biggest purchases a person makes, but the standard car-buying process - sitting around the dealer showroom all-day Sunday only to walk out without the car or feeling abused - also eats away at precious leisure time.  That's why Debbie and her husband turned to the Internet to do research on the Dodge Stratus and, then, to Auto-By-Tel (www.autobytel.com) to actually purchase the car through one of its subscribing dealers. </P>
<P>"After establishing what we thought would be the "best deal possible" we decided to try Auto-By-Tel. Not only did the Auto-By-Tel dealer beat our best price by $1,000, but he also got me the exact car I wanted, including color, for $300 under the invoice price!" Debbie explains.</P>
<P>Consumers are encouraged to research their vehicle of choice (Auto-By-Tel has links to popular automotive information Web sites) and then submit a request to Auto-By-Tel. The request is sent to one of the 1,400 dealers assisting customers nationwide. The dealer follows up within forty-eight hours with an extremely competitive price -  no negotiations, no surprises.  The program costs the consumer absolutely nothing and can not only save her thousands of dollars, but will also eliminate the time and energy wasted in the traditional negotiating process.</P>
<P>Auto-By-Tel has brought over 100,000 requests for new vehicles to their dealer base over the past year with an average purchase rate of nearly 70%. J.D. Power and Associates' Donald Keithley attributes Auto-By-Tel's success to one important factor: "Auto-By-Tel makes it easy for a consumer to purchase a car. This is an increasingly important consideration for two-income families operating under severe time constraints." </P>
<P>Peter Ellis, Auto-By-Tel's co-founder, says simply, "Auto-By-Tel takes the hassles out of buying a new car.  We help dealers find serious buyers and bring rock-bottom prices to consumers. It's a win-win situation."</P>
<P>Anyone with a computer and modem can access Auto-By-Tel.  Just set your Internet browser to http://www.autobytel.com or access Auto-By-Tel on any of the major online services, including Prodigy, CompuServe, America Online and Microsoft Network.

<CENTER><P><B>Consumers Embrace High-Tech Car Buying Methods:<BR>
Internet-based Auto-By-Tel's No-Haggle Purchasing Program </B></P></CENTER>



<P><B>Corona del Mar, CA</B>, April 15, 1996 - The results are in: Consumers are ready and willing to embrace new methods of car buying. Fed up with traditional dealership tactics, car buyers are actively seeking alternatives-from used car superstores to innovative Internet-based programs like Auto-By-Tel.</P>
<P>Interestingly, the year-old Auto-By-Tel is capturing the largest majority of these alternative sales. "Auto-By-Tel's amazing growth has even astounded me," says Peter Ellis, Auto-By-Tel co-founder and President, "and it proves that the Internet is the most viable marketing tool in the information age."</P>
<P>A quick review of the Auto-By-Tel program illustrates why this concept has taken the automotive industry by storm. Not only does the customer make a request for a new car from the privacy and comfort of his own home but, as Auto-By-Tel customer Dan Chiaverini says, the price "was such a huge discount over and above anything I have ever been quoted...I felt like I put something over on them." </P>
<P>J.D. Power's Donald Keithley says Auto-By-Tel's success can be attributed to one important factor: "Auto-By-Tel makes it easy for a consumer to purchase a car. By offering a 'one-stop Internet contact,' Auto-By-Tel solves the consumer's needs quickly and easily. This is an increasingly important consideration for two-income families operating under severe time constraints."</P>
<P>Auto-By-Tel assists clients in purchasing cars and trucks via a large
subscribing dealer network that is dedicated to providing efficient
low-cost car-buying to the U.S. consumer (Auto-By-Tel opened in Canada April 1996). Before a consumer submits a purchase request, he is encouraged to thoroughly research his vehicle of choice, using other online sources, like Edmund's Automobile Buyer's Guides and Microsoft CarSource, and then submit a request to Auto-By-Tel. The request is sent to one of over 1,400 dealers who assist Auto-By-Tel customers nationally.  The dealer follows up with a price quote within forty-eight hours.  The program costs the consumer absolutely nothing and can save him thousands of dollars.</P>
<P>Anyone with a computer and modem can access Auto-By-Tel.  Point your Internet browser to http://www.autobytel.com, or look for Auto-By-Tel on CompuServe, Prodigy, America Online and Microsoft Network.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>Looking for a New Car?  You'll Find the Best Deal on the Internet.<BR>

There's No "Gotcha!" with Auto-By-Tel</B>.</P></CENTER>




<P>
<B>St. Louis, MO</B>, March 12, 1996 - Cameron and Kathleen Cook of Columbia, IL were so thrilled with the great deal they got using Auto-By-Tel, the premier Internet-based automotive program, that they had their nephew use the service just one week after they picked up their new car from Huey's Honda in St. Louis County, MO.
Cameron Cook, a Locomotive Engineer for Union Pacific Railroad, explains, "We've driven Hondas since 1981 and have generally paid near sticker price to do so. When I visited Auto-By-Tel's home page (www.autobytel.com) and saw the claim that its dealers will give users a low, competitive price-without costing me a dime-my ears perked up." Mr. Cook soon discovered that Auto-By-Tel's claims were true. </P>




<P>In order to determine which new Honda was right for them, the Cooks took to prowling dealer lots after dark-checking out sticker prices, colors and options. Mr. Cook then visited Edmund's Automobile Buyer's Guide on the Internet. This Web site gives a complete listing of dealer and retail invoices, as well as reviews of new cars-at no cost to the user.</P>




<P>The service is simple. First the Cooks filled out a purchase request on Auto-By-Tel's home page, and within a day or so a call came through from Huey's Honda. "They told me they had our car and gave me the Auto-By-Tel price. Since I had already checked invoice prices with Edmund's, I knew they were quoting me the dealer invoice price!" says a surprised Mr. Cook. "I was shocked to say the least-and I was waiting for the 'Gotcha!' to come."</P>




<P>But it never did. When the Cooks picked up their car from Huey's Honda they expected the dealership to attempt to upgrade them and gouge them for extras, but that didn't happen. "Over the past twenty-seven years, I've purchased 12 new cars and this was the very first time I felt I got a good deal-and I did it with no haggling," Mr. Cook concludes.</P>




<P>One of the reasons Auto-By-Tel's program is so successful is because they expect their participating dealers to meet high standards. Huey's Honda, for example, is managed by Andy Huey, the Vice President of the Greater St. Louis Automotive Association. Other dealerships based in Missouri include the Lou Fusz Auto Group (St. Louis), Shawnee Mission Ford (Kansas City), Car City (St. Joseph), and Marcus Allen Toyota (Kansas City). </P>


<P>Anyone with a computer and modem can access Auto-By-Tel.  Point your Internet browser to http://www.autobytel.com, or look for Auto-By-Tel on CompuServe, Prodigy, America Online and Microsoft Network.

<BR>

<P><A NAME="2"><B>Soyez</A> un consommateur averti.
Nos concessionnaires affili&eacute;s promettent de vous communiquer le prix de
vente de plus &eacute;conomique pour votre prochain v&eacute;hicule. Mais saurez-vous
vraiment appr&eacute;cier cette offre si vous n'&ecirc;tes pas un consommateurs averti ?</B><BR>



Nous vous recommandons FORTEMENT de faire vos devoirs et de vous renseigner
le mieux possible sur le v&eacute;hicule que vous d&eacute;sirez acheter AVANT de placer
votre demande d'achat &agrave; Auto-By-Tel. Utilisez les ressources offertes par
l'Internet et lisez des magazines non biais&eacute;s comme Consumers Reports, et
au Qu&eacute;bec, Le Monde de l'Auto. Nous vous encourageons m&ecirc;me &agrave; magasiner chez
les concessionnaires automobiles de votre r&eacute;gion afin de comparer le
service offert et les prix avec ceux communiqu&eacute;s par votre concessionnaire
affili&eacute; &agrave; Auto-By-Tel. Vous serez alors en mesure d'appr&eacute;cier la facilit&eacute;
d'utilisation et l'honn&ecirc;tet&eacute; du programme Auto-By-Tel.

<BR>



<P><A NAME="3"><B>Faites</A> vos devoirs.</B><BR>

Notre programme donne les meilleurs r&eacute;sultats quand vous fournissez le plus
de d&eacute;tails possible &agrave; propos du v&eacute;hicule qui vous int&eacute;resse. Notre
formulaire de demande d'achat est tr&egrave;s g&eacute;n&eacute;ral mais nous pouvons traiter
les demandes les plus sp&eacute;cifiques. Que vous d&eacute;siriez cette nouvelle Mustang
GT noire ou en noir m&eacute;tallis&eacute; lustr&eacute;, nous pouvons vous aider !</P>

<P>Compl&eacute;tez la section situ&eacute;e au bas de notre formulaire afin de nous
pr&eacute;ciser les sp&eacute;cifications de votre nouvelle voiture. Si vous connaissez
le num&eacute;ro de s&eacute;rie des options offertes par le manufacturier, tapez-les
&eacute;galement. Ils ne sont pas n&eacute;cessaires au traitement de votre demande mais
ils aideront le concessionnaire affili&eacute; &agrave; Auto-By-Tel &agrave; &eacute;quiper votre
v&eacute;hicule tel que vous le d&eacute;sirez.</P>

<P><A NAME="4"><B>Auto-By-Tel</A> ne peut accepter de demandes multiples.
Nous comprenons qu'acqu&eacute;rir un nouveau v&eacute;hicule est un investissement
majeur qu'il ne faut pas prendre &agrave; la l&eacute;g&egrave;re.</B><BR>


Quand nous recevons votre demande d'achat, nous croyons que vous &ecirc;tes pr&ecirc;t
&agrave; acheter ou louer le v&eacute;hicule dans les jours qui suivent. Le
concessionnaire affili&eacute; &agrave; Auto-By-Tel qui recevra votre demande suppose
&eacute;galement que vous &ecirc;tre dispos&eacute; &agrave; acheter et vous donnera  par t&eacute;l&eacute;phone un
prix extr&ecirc;mement comp&eacute;titif, sp&eacute;cialement calcul&eacute; pour vous. Nos
concessionnaires affili&eacute;s investissent &eacute;norm&eacute;ment de temps et d'efforts
afin de satisfaire les attentes que vous avez dans le programme
Auto-By-Tel; veuillez ne pas les bombarder de demandes inutiles.</P>

<P>Si vous d&eacute;sirez vous informer afin d'acqu&eacute;rir plus d'un v&eacute;hicule, veuillez
nous contacter par courrier &eacute;lectronique &agrave; l'adresse <A HREF="MAILTO:manager@autobytel.com">manager@autobytel.com</A></P>

<BR>




<P><A NAME="5"><B>Soyez</A> pr&ecirc;t &agrave; acheter.</B><BR>

Les concessionnaires affili&eacute;s &agrave; Auto-By-Tel s'engagent &agrave; vous fournir des
prix extr&ecirc;mement comp&eacute;titifs pour les v&eacute;hicules que vous d&eacute;sirez acheter.
Le prix qui vous sera communiqu&eacute; par le concessionnaire affili&eacute; &agrave;
Auto-By-Tel a &eacute;t&eacute; calcul&eacute; sp&eacute;cifiquement pour vous, pour le v&eacute;hicule que
vous avez choisi, et avec les options et caract&eacute;ristiques que vous avez
mentionn&eacute;es. Le concessionnaire ne peut garantir que le v&eacute;hicule demand&eacute;
sera conserv&eacute; en inventaire au prix communiqu&eacute; plus de quelques jours apr&egrave;s
que vous ayez plac&eacute; votre demande et re&ccedil;u le prix de vente.</P>

<P>Pour cette raison, nous vous recommandons fortement de nous faire parvenir
une demande d'achat SEULEMENT si vous d&eacute;sirez vraiment effectuer l'achat
dans les jours qui suivent. Ainsi, le prix communiqu&eacute; par le
concessionnaire affili&eacute; &agrave; Auto-By-Tel sera le plus exact possible.
</P>

<P><A NAME="6"> <B>Les</A> conditions du march&eacute; influencent le prix de vente.</B></A><BR>
Des conditions inhabituelles du march&eacute; (d&eacute;lais de production, manque de pi&egrave;ces, etc.) rendent le prix de vente de certains mod&egrave;les de voiture presqu'impossible &agrave; n&eacute;gocier en bas d'un certain plancher, m&ecirc;me pour les clients d'Auto-By-Tel.</P>

<P>Voici la liste des v&eacute;hicules souvent affect&eacute;s par ces situations pr&eacute;caires.
M&ecirc;me si l'approvisionnement des ces v&eacute;hicules varie de province &agrave; province
(ou d'&eacute;tat en &eacute;tat), ils demerurent difficiles &agrave; trouver dans la plupart
des r&eacute;gions d'Am&eacute;rique du Nord. Toutefois, les concessionnaire affili&eacute;s &agrave;
Auto-By-Tel peuvent vous communiquer des prix tr&egrave;s int&eacute;ressants m&ecirc;me pour
des v&eacute;hicules tels que:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Chevrolet :</B> Impala SS, Suburban, Tahoe<BR>
<B>Chrysler :</B> Sebring convertible, Town & Country LXI Minivan<BR>
<B>Dodge :</B> Grand Caravan LE<BR>
<B>GMC :</B> Suburban, Yukon<BR>
<B>Honda :</B> tous les v&eacute;hicules de la gamme Civic sont difficiles &agrave; trouver<BR>
<B>Land Rover :</B> Discovery, Range Rover<BR>
<B>Mercedes :</B> E320<BR>
<B>Mitsubishi :</B> 3000GT, Eclipse Spyder, et toutes les d&eacute;capotables<BR>
<B>Porsche :</B> tous les mod&egrave;les<BR>
<B>Subaru :</B> Outback<BR>
<B>Toyota :</B> Camry (V6), 4Runner, Land Cruiser, RAV4<BR>
<B>Volkwagen :</B> Golf GTI<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Veuillez noter que  presque tous les manufacturiers sont en manque de
v&eacute;hicules de mod&egrave;le-ann&eacute;e 1996. Ceci survient lorsqu'il n'y a pas
suffisamment de stock de mod&egrave;les 1996 et que les 1997 n'ont pas encore &eacute;t&eacute;
livr&eacute;s chez les concessionnaires. Ces manques affectent surtout les mod&egrave;les
les plus populaires.

<P><A NAME="7"> <B>Les concessionnaires affili&eacute;s &agrave; Auto-By-Tel sont situ&eacute;s pr&egrave;s de chez vous !</B><BR>

Quand un concessionnaire affili&eacute; &agrave; Auto-By-Tel vous contacte, sachez que
vous faites affaire avec une personne recommandable d'un &eacute;tablissement
accr&eacute;dit&eacute; ayant pignon sur rue tout pr&egrave;s de chez vous. La relation de
confiance que vous &eacute;tablirez avec cette personne vous servira lorsque vous
aurez besoin d'entretien et de pi&egrave;ces de rechange pour votre nouveau
v&eacute;hicule. Toutes les ventes de v&eacute;hicules sont effectu&eacute;es par
l'interm&eacute;diaire de concessionnaires franchis&eacute;s et licenci&eacute;s qui s'affilient
&agrave; Auto-By-Tel.

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=5>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>La compagnie</B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<P>Auto-By-Tel Corporation administre le plus important programme de vente
automobiles facile d'acc&egrave;s bas&eacute; sur l'Internet. Le programme d'achat &agrave; bas
prix et sans tracas d'Auto-By-Tel est accessible &agrave; travers le Canada et les
&Eacute;tats-Unis.</P>

<P>En inventant le principe d'achat de v&eacute;hicules &eacute;lectronique Peter Ellis, le
Pr&eacute;sident-directeur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral d'Auto-By-Tel, a m&eacute;tamorphos&eacute; le processus de
vente et d'achat d'automobiles.</P>

<P>Le but de la compagnie est de rendre la vente et l'achat de voitures,
traditionnellement v&eacute;cue de fa&ccedil;on d&eacute;sagr&eacute;able, la plus facile et agr&eacute;able
que possible.</P></TD></TR>


<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Historique de la compagnie</B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP><P>Auto-By-Tel a &eacute;t&eacute; fond&eacute; en mars 1995 par Peter Ellis et John Bedrosian &agrave; Corona del Mar, en Californie. La compagnie a rapidement pris de
l'expansion, la for&ccedil;ant &agrave; quitter ses petits locaux en septembre 1996 en
faveur d'un &eacute;difice de 12 000 pieds/carr&eacute;s situ&eacute; &agrave; Irvine en Californie o&ugrave;
travaillent actuellement pr&egrave;s de 80 employ&eacute;s &agrave; temps complet.</P>

<P>Selon une &eacute;tude d'Arthur Andersen, la croissance d'Auto-By-Tel fut
stup&eacute;fiante. Par exemple, lors du mois de septembre 1995, Auto-By-Tel a
trait&eacute; 5 500 demandes d'achat ou de location alors qu'un an apr&egrave;s, ce
chiffre &eacute;tait pass&eacute; &agrave; plus de 35 000, soit six fois plus. Depuis ses
d&eacute;buts, Auto-By-Tel a trait&eacute; plus de 400 000 demandes d'achat ou de
location.</P>

<P>En septembre 1996, Auto-By-Tel compl&eacute;tait un financement de 15$ million
dans les s&eacute;ries A pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentielles. On compte parmi les investisseurs : GE
Capital Services, American International Group, Inc., ContiFinancial
Corporation et Monsieur Michael Fuchs, l'ancien pr&eacute;sident et directeur
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de HBO et de Warner Music Group.</P></TD></TR>



<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Le programme.</B></TD><TD><P>Auto-By-Tel est un service de marketing et d'information bas&eacute; sur l'Internet qui permet aux consommateurs d'acheter, de louer et d'assurer
des automobiles et camions &agrave; bas prix. Gr&acirc;ce au site Internet
d'Auto-By-Tel, situ&eacute; &agrave; l'adresse www.autobytel.com, les consommateurs
peuvent soumettre gratuitement une demande d'achat ou de location pour
toutv&eacute;hicule de leur choix. Cette demande est achemin&eacute;e dans les 48 heures
qui suivent &agrave; un concessionnaire affili&eacute; &agrave; Auto-By-Tel qui communiquera,
dans un d&eacute;lais de 48 heures, un prix comp&eacute;titif et final pour le v&eacute;hicule
choisi.  Afin de servir efficacement ces nouveaux consommateurs
internautes, Auto-By-Tel offre &agrave; ses concessionnaires une formation ainsi
qu'un entranement sp&eacute;ciaux.</P>

<P>Le programme d'Auto-By-Tel est absolument gratuit pour les consommateurs.
Il n'y a aucune obligation, de frais cach&eacute;s ou de club &agrave; adh&eacute;rer.
Auto-By-Tel &eacute;limine le climat d'intimidation qui r&egrave;gne souvent chez les
concessionnaires ainsi que les n&eacute;gociations d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ables avec un vendeur.</P>

<P>Auto-By-Tel offre une source de services inestimables aux acheteurs de
voitures. Les utilisateurs d'Auto-By-Tel peuvent se documenter sur les
v&eacute;hicules de leur choix par l'entremise des fournisseurs d'information
automobile offerts par Auto-By-Tel, puis n&eacute;gocier une assurance automobile
&agrave; bas comp&eacute;titif gr&acirc;ce &agrave; AIG (American International Group, Inc.). De plus,
Auto-By-Tel va lancer en 1997 une gamme de nouveaux services qui incluent
un d&eacute;partement de financement &eacute;lectronique offert par Chase Auto Finance,
un super-march&eacute; de la voiture d'occasion garantie et un programme
d'assistance routi&egrave;re.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>La philosophie</B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<P>Auto-By-Tel transforme compl&egrave;tement la fa&ccedil;on dont les voitures sont vendues
et achet&eacute;es. La compagnie utilise une technologie r&eacute;volutionnaire, dans ce
cas-ci l'Internet, afin d'am&eacute;liorer le fonctionnement de l'industrie
automobile.</P>

<P>Auto-By-Tel travaille en &eacute;troite collaboration avec chaque concessionnaire
affili&eacute; afin de d'am&eacute;liorer le syst&egrave;me de vente traditionnel et s'assure
que chaque client est trait&eacute; respectueusement tout en se voyant offrir le
prix le plus comp&eacute;titif qui soit. Auto-By-Tel encourage les
concessionnaires &agrave; instaurer un d&eacute;partement Auto-By-Tel o&ugrave; un g&eacute;rant
Auto-By-Tel, et non pas un vendeur traditionnel, prend soin des clients
d'Auto-By-Tel.</P>

<P>Auto-By-Tel croit qu'il faut faciliter les processus de vente et d'achat de
v&eacute;hicules. En pr&eacute;sentant aux consommateurs une fa&ccedil;on directe et &eacute;conomique
d'acheter des voitures et aux concessionnaires une fa&ccedil;on d'augmenter leurs
ventes, Auto-By-Tel croit ne faire que des gagnants.</P>
</TD></TR>


<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Les programmes</B></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>

Nous connaissions toutes les options que nous d&eacute;sirions avoir, ainsi que les plus r&eacute;centes informations sur les prix de vente, le cot aux concessionnaires, et autres.

Pas de pression, pas de n&eacute;gociations ou de surprises cach&eacute;es. Vous avez rendu l'achat de ma voiture extrmement agr&eacute;able.

<P>&#171; Le prix que l'on m'a communiqu&eacute; &eacute;tait un tel rabais en comparaison au prix qu'avais obtenu auparavant. Je n'arrivais tout simplement pas &agrave; le croire. Mais quand le concessionnaire vous communique un prix, il doit s'y tenir car s'il ne le fait pas il ne sera pas en affaire avec Auto-By-Tel bien longtemps. &#187;</P>

<P>&#171; Auto-By-Tel est la fa&ccedil;on d'acheter du futur. Les " baby-boomers" de trente ans sont intelligents et bien inform&eacute;s. Avec une carri&egrave;re &agrave; plein temps et une famille, je n'ai pas le temps de faire le tour des concessionnaires. Le concessionnaire Auto-By-Tel m'a trouv&eacute; la voiture que je d&eacute;sirais pour un prix 300$ inf&eacute;rieur au prix de vente du concessionnaire ! &#187;</P>

<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=548 HEIGHT=8  SRC="hrgreen.gif"></CENTER><BR>
<P> &#171; Le prix que j'ai obtenu &eacute;tait imbattable &agrave; Atlanta. De plus, le concessionnaire m'a royalement re&ccedil;u. Il n'y a eu aucun probl&egrave;me ou d'ennui de derni&egrave;re minute. Les concessionnaires BMW d'Atlanta riaient de moi mais c'est maintenant moi qui rit.

<P><B>John C. Bedrosian, pr&eacute;sident et co-fondateur</B></P>

<P>C'est parce qu'il &eacute;tait convaincu que l'industrie automobile de 1994 &eacute;tait toujours &agrave; l'&acirc;ge de pierre, comme l'&eacute;tait l'industrie des soins de sant&eacute; au cours des ann&eacute;es 1960 que John Bedrosian, un pionnier dans l'industrie des soins de sant&eacute;, a fond&eacute; en 1995, avec Peter Ellis, Auto-By-Tel. Bedrosian a pr&eacute;dit la croissance spectaculaire d'Auto-By-Tel et pr&eacute;voit qu'elle surpassera celle de l'industrie des soins de sant&eacute;.</P>

<P>Monsieur Bedrosian &eacute;tait auparavant le vice-pr&eacute;sident ex&eacute;cutif, directeur et co-fondateur de National Medical Entreprises, Inc. (NME); une compagnie cot&eacute;e &agrave; la bourse, valant plus de $4 milliards, et r&eacute;cemment renomm&eacute;e Tenet Healthcare Corporation. Alors qu'il &eacute;tait un membre du conseil de direction, Monsieur Bedrosian &eacute;tait responsable de l'administration, des communications corporatives, des relations avec le gouvernement et l'industrie et fut aussi un investisseur au sein de NME. Il fut aussi un orateur distingu&eacute; lors de d&eacute;bats sur les soins de sant&eacute;.
</P>
<P>Avant de fonder NME en 1969 Monsieur Bedrosian a exerc&eacute; le droit dans le domaine des soins de sant&eacute;.</P>

<P>Monsieur Bedrosian d&eacute;tient un baccalaur&eacute;at en science, sp&eacute;cialis&eacute; en administration de l'universit&eacute; de Californie &agrave; Los Angeles, et est aussi bachelier en droit de l'universit&eacute; South California. Il demeure &agrave; Los Angeles, en Californie, avec son &eacute;pouse Judy et il a trois enfants.

<P><B>Peter Ellis, pr&eacute;sident directeur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral et co-fondateur</B></P>

<P>Peter Ellis, un concessionnaire automobile enthousiaste, poss&egrave;de plus de trente ans d'exp&eacute;rience dans l'industrie automobile. Apr&egrave;s avoir vendu sa toute premi&egrave;re voiture &agrave; l'&acirc;ge de seize ans, Peter Ellis n'a cess&eacute; de foncer et a poss&eacute;d&eacute; pas moins de 16 garages automobiles ainsi que des concessions d'affaires li&eacute;es &agrave; l'automobile dans les &eacute;tats de la Californie et de l'Arizona. Son succ&egrave;s fut retentissant et il fut l'un des concessionnaires les plus importants du sud de la Californie.</P>

<P>Monsieur Ellis est reconnu pour ses strat&eacute;gies de marketing orient&eacute;es vers le consommateur. Il fut l'un des premiers concessionnaires &agrave; reconna&icirc;tre les avantages de d&eacute;voiler sans d&eacute;tour le prix de vente final de ses voitures; une m&eacute;thode de vente devenue extr&ecirc;mement populaire aujourd'hui. Il a &eacute;galement vite compris que les consommateurs seraient int&eacute;ress&eacute;s &agrave; l'id&eacute;e d'acheter des v&eacute;hicules &agrave; l'unit&eacute; de soci&eacute;t&eacute;s qui ne font normalement affaire qu'avec des grosses compagnies.</P>

<P>En 1994, grandement d&eacute;&ccedil;u par le traditionnel syst&egrave;me de vente de fabricant &agrave; concessionnaire &agrave; acheteur qui ne g&eacute;n&egrave;re que des prix &eacute;lev&eacute;s et des consommateurs frustr&eacute;s, Ellis analyse de nouvelles avenues. Ses recherches d&eacute;montrent que les consommateurs d&eacute;sirent contr&ocirc;ler l'acte d'achat et ne veulent pas &ecirc;tre intimid&eacute;s par des vendeurs trop persuasifs. Il fonde Auto-By-Tel au d&eacute;but de 1995, convaincu que l'Internet, qui se d&eacute;veloppe &agrave; vive allure, offre le moyen le plus simple et le plus efficace de rendre l'achat de v&eacute;hicules agr&eacute;able pour les consommateurs.</P>

<P>Monsieur Ellis a deux enfants et vit avec son &eacute;pouse Susie (une experte am&eacute;ricaine du conditionnement physique) &agrave; Corona del Mar en Californie. Il est natif de San Jose, en Californie et est dipl&ocirc;m&eacute; de l'universit&eacute; San Jose State.</P>

<P><B>Pourquoi Peter Ellis croit-il en Auto-By-Tel</B></P>

<IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=20 ALT="Pete Ellis" ALIGN=LEFT SRC="pete1.gif"><BR>


<A HREF="email.html"><IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=20 ALT="Parlez-nous" ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="email.gif" border=0></A>


<P>Il n'y a pas si longtemps, le pr&eacute;sident d'Auto-By-Tel, Peter Ellis, &eacute;tait lui-m&ecirc;me un concessionnaire automobile, propri&eacute;taire de 16 garages de voitures neuves, avant qu'il cr&eacute;e Auto-By-Tel. Insatisfait du syst&egrave;me traditionnel de vente d'automobiles des fabricants aux concessionnaires puis aux acheteurs, et qui ne cause que des prix de vente gonfl&eacute;s et des acheteurs insatisfaits, Ellis a analys&eacute; le comportement des consommateurs lors de l'achat de v&eacute;hicules neufs. Cette &eacute;tude, ainsi que la vaste exp&eacute;rience de Ellis dans le domaine de la vente, l'ont convaincu que les acheteurs d&eacute;siraient contr&ocirc;ler le processus d'achat et non pas &ecirc;tre intimid&eacute;s par des vendeurs persuasifs! Les gens d&eacute;siraient une nouvelle fa&ccedil;on d'acheter, plus simple et moins co&ucirc;teuse. Peter les a &eacute;cout&eacute; et a fond&eacute; Auto-By-Tel.

<P>&#171; la fa&ccedil;on la plus moderne, la plus rapide et la plus agr&eacute;able jamais invent&eacute; de d&eacute;nicher un v&eacute;hicule neuf. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw, le 26 janvier 1996</P>

<P>&#171; Auto-By-Tel, la compagnie &eacute;lectronique au service des consommateurs et des concessionnaires automobiles, ne se contente pas de mettre la comp&eacute;tition en d&eacute;route comme un v&eacute;t&eacute;ran des courses Indy. La compagnie bas&eacute;e &agrave; Corona del Mar d&eacute;sire chambouler les habitudes de vente de d'industrie automobile et les habitudes d'achat des consommateurs. Les analystes croient qu'Auto-By-Tel est nettement en avance sur la comp&eacute;tition. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--Reuters Business Report, le 14 ao&ucirc;t 1996</P>

<P>&#171; Auto-By-Tel est le site Internet &agrave; visiter; notre site du jour. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--&#171; The Most Toys &#187; &agrave; CNN/FN, le 14 ao&ucirc;t 1996</P>

<P>&#171; Quand on m'a communiqu&eacute; le prix, j'ai &eacute;carquill&eacute; des yeux. C'&eacute;tait 7 000$ de moins que le prix exig&eacute; une semaine auparavant par le concessionnaire de mon quartier. Pas de discussion &agrave; propos du prix ou d'ind&eacute;cisions de la part du vendeur. Monsieur Fleet (le concessionnaire Auto-By-Tel de Vancouver) m'a &eacute;tonn&eacute; en me proposant de conduire la voiture pour me rendre chez ma m&egrave;re afin que nous puissions bien la regarder. Le lendemain matin, Monsieur Fleet nous a conduit &agrave; son garage o&ugrave; nous avons sign&eacute; les papiers. Voil&agrave; ! Elle avait sa nouvelle auto ! La question est : quand serons-nous capables de faire pareil au Japon ?<BR>
<DD>--The Japan Times, le 14 ao&ucirc;t 1996</P>


<P>&#171; Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; ce syst&egrave;me, vous regardez droit dans le futur. &#187;
<DD>--CKVU-TV (Global) le 7 ao&ucirc;t 1996</P>

<P>&#171; C'est l'unique fa&ccedil;on d'acheter une voiture de nos jours. Je n'arrive pas &agrave; comprendre pourquoi des gens d&eacute;sirent tant visiter dix ou 20 concessionnaires, donner des coups de pied sur les pneus et se faire ennuyer par des vendeurs. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--Un consommateur d'Auto-By-Tel interview&eacute; &agrave; WHDH-TV de Boston, aux informations de 11 heures et 6h30, le 31 juillet 1996</P>

<P>&#171; John Buie d'Edmonton d&eacute;clare qu'il y avait un &eacute;cart de quelques milliers de dollars entre le prix qu'il a re&ccedil;u quand il a commenc&eacute; &agrave; chercher et celui qu'il a pay&eacute; pour son nouveau Ford Aerostar avec Auto-By-Tel. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--Service de presse &#171; Canada Press &#187;, le 29 juillet 1996</P>

<P>&#171; Pour Madame Sheryl Thomson (une consommatrice qui a utilis&eacute; Auto-By-Tel), l'unique fa&ccedil;on d'acheter une nouvelle voiture est de d&eacute;marrer son ordinateur avant de se rendre chez le concessionnaire. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--Le Toronto Star,  le 27 juillet 1996</P>


<P>&#171; Auto-By-Tel peut vous &eacute;viter les d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ments d'une tourn&eacute;e &eacute;tourdissante des concessionnaires. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--San Francisco Chronicle, le 23 juillet 1996</P>

<P>&#171; une nouvelle fa&ccedil;on d'acheter une voiture qui vous &eacute;vite tout ce &#171; plaisir &#187; et qui vous fait &eacute;conomiser de l'argent. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--CNET Central (USA & SCI-FI Networks), juillet 1996</P>

<P>&#171; Acheter une voiture ne sera plus jamais pareil. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--&#171;Sunday Morning &#187; &agrave; CBC, le 12 mai 1996</P>

<P>&#171; Ce qui m'a stup&eacute;fait fut l'appel du concessionnaire Auto-By-Tel qui me contactait apr&egrave;s un jour ou deux, me communiquant un prix bas et ferme. Il m'a mme propos&eacute; de conduire la voiture et de conclure la vente &agrave; mon bureau ou &agrave; ma r&eacute;sidence tout en maintenant son prix comp&eacute;titif ! &#187;<BR>

<DD>--U.S. News and World Report, le 6 mai 1996</P>

<P>&#171; Le secret du succ&egrave;s d'Auto-By-Tel provient de ses bas prix et de son syst&egrave;me d'achat sans pression, ni n&eacute;gociation. Les consommateurs l'adorent et signalent leur approbation avec leurs portefeuilles. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--Internet World, mai 1996</P>

<P>&#171; Seulement que vous, des milliers de belles voitures et une souris. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--U. Magazine, avril 1996</P>

<P>&#171; J'ai &eacute;conomis&eacute; 3 200$. F&eacute;licitations &agrave; Auto-By-Tel pour l'exceptionnel service gratuit qu'ils offrent. &#187;<BR>

<P>&#171; Monsieur Chin, un client d'Auto-By-Tel, d&eacute;clare : &#171; L'exp&eacute;rience fut absolument sans douleur. Il n'y a pas eu d'argumentation &agrave; propos du prix. Pas de pression psychologique. Pas de surprise. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--Fortune Magazine, le 4 mars 1996</P>

<P>&#171; Les consommateurs ont d&eacute;montr&eacute; qu'ils d&eacute;sirent acheter sans ennui, ni d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ment. Monsieur Jay Froude, qui a lou&eacute; une Mercury 1996 avec l'aide d'Auto-By-Tel, d&eacute;clare : &#171; c'est une fa&ccedil;on d'acheter un v&eacute;hicule qui &eacute;tait attendue depuis tr&egrave;s longtemps. &#187;<BR>

<DD>--Automotive News, le 5 f&eacute;vrier 1996</P>

<P>&#171; Il suffit de quelques clics de la souris de l'ordinateur. Si la voiture vous int&eacute;resse, vous l'achetez, sinon, pas de probl&egrave;me. Le service est gratuit et les &eacute;conomies sont int&eacute;ressantes. &#187;<BR>

<TR><TD ROWSPAN=19 VALIGN=TOP><IMG WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=35 ALT="Answers" SRC="gfx/answers.gif"><P></TD>
<TD><A NAME="b1">Ford indicates that there are no major mechanical or structural changes expected for the '97 Mustang GT. There are no significant alterations in the engine, transmission, etc., and all the listed refinements  are really at the level of accessories. There will be new cloth fabric in the GT, and one interior color change: medium graphite leather will be available, and white leather has been deleted for '97. A passive anti-theft system will now be standard (last year it was optional), there will be a smaller keyless entry system, a 2-way headrest replacing the 4-way for the GT, a rear spoiler on all vehicles after 1996 1/2, and door handles with illuminated switches will be eliminated. Front floor mats and body side moldings are available in one package, and a polished 17" wheel treatment is optional as well. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A NAME="b2">Dodge indicates there are rumors of a new SUV--a Ram 4x4. At this point, however, they claim it's not even in the development or design stage, but that they were still "thinking" about it. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A NAME="b3">At the time of our inquiries, Acura had no information available on the '97 Integra. The people we spoke with hadn't received the product literature, although they stated that the new 97s are expected to be available at dealers by the end of October. 
Right now there are no nationally sponsored rebates or incentives offered by Acura for the Integra, although this is year-end clearance time on 96s, and there may be many specials offered at the dealer level. If you want to be put on the 97 Integra mailing list you can call 1-800-862-2872 and they will send you materials when they arrive, or call customer relations at 1-800-382-2238 for updates--they can give you design changes as soon as they get them.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="c1"><P>Unfortunately, there is no single, magic "math" formula we can offer you to determine what a dealer will give you on a trade-in. There are too many variables that affect the resale value of a car, and too many variables that make a particular car an attractive trade deal for any given dealer at a particular moment in time. </P>
<P>The value depends on a combination of market conditions, the condition of the car, mileage, etc. We've been told by an "inside" source that the condition of the car--if it's really spic and span, and looks good--can make a huge difference in the value of a trade-in. Keeping good records of maintenance and oil-changes is also a big plus. In addition, market conditions for particular cars vary widely--for instance, certain used Jeeps are hot, and may fetch a lot more on the used car market than a guide to used car prices would lead you to believe. The smart consumer will go into a trade-in armed with information from one of the reliable used car pricing guides--like the Kelly Blue Book. This guide, although its estimated prices are not absolute, has a good reputation, with quite accurate information. You should have a reasonable goal in mind when you talk to a dealer. Don't go in "cold". </P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="c2"><P>The overall trend in the car market--whether you're talking about  passenger sedans, light truck, or vans--is to include passenger-side airbags in the very near future if they don't already. Although it is not mandatory at this point, it will be soon. Engineers from NHTSA (the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in Washington, which monitors car safety and regulations) informed us that driver and passenger side airbags will be mandatory on all passenger cars in 1998, and for all light trucks and passenger vans in the 1999 model year. At this point, it remains voluntary--but many manufacturers have added them to attract the increasingly safety-conscious consumer.</P>

<P>Dodge indicated that the 1997 Dodge Ram is not slated to include a passenger-side airbag, but that they plan to have it in '98. Dual airbags do come on the smaller Dodge Dakota for 1997. The GMC Sierra includes a passenger air bag on their lighter trucks (including the half-ton Sierra) but not on the big, heavy-duty Sierras for '97. The smaller GMC Sonoma does include a passenger airbag for '97. The bigger, heavier trucks are tougher in a crash--which is why they are not included in the federal mandate for 1999.</P></TD></TR>
<TD><A NAME="a12"><P>This "rumor" you've heard about a new V-6 available in the Ford Explorer is about to become a reality--and these '97 Explorers should start hitting the showrooms after October 2nd. Keep your eyes open for them around then.  An all-new 4.0 liter 205 horsepower SOHC V-6 will debut for '97, and the 5.0 liter (210) horsepower V-8 will return as the other drivetrain option.  This upgraded V-6 will be optional  on the 4-door XL and XLT models, and the 2-door XL/Sport. It will come standard in the Eddie Bauer and Limited models. Ford informed me that the 4x4/V-6 combo you want will be available --there will be an optional control-track 4x4 in the V-6 powered Eddie Bauer and Limited. 
</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="a13"><P>We spoke to Jeep in August and they said production of the '97 Grand Cherokee Limited was slated for January 1997. (The vehicles will be made at the Jefferson Avenue North Plant and will probably be available in showrooms in late winter.)</P>

<P>When we asked what was new for '97, Jeep indicated this information is subject to change and told us the following: 
</P>
<P>The biggest planned change is that this is the first year that a 2WD will be available on a Grand Cherokee--on the Laredo and Limited, not on the Orvis. On the 5.2 liter V-8 engines (Limited/Laredo) there will be a two-wheel drive option. Further refinements for '97 include a single point air-bag sensor, new paint colors, a flip-top glass lift gate standard on Limited and Orvis, a new Mark 20i Automatic Brake System on all Cherokees, VIN anti-theft labels and stamping throughout, an upgraded front axle (now a model 30), and an upgraded rear axle (now a model 35) etc.  
</P>
<P>The available colors for '97 will be flame red, black, stone white, light driftwood satin glow, forest green pearl coat, moss green pearl coat, char-gold II with satin glow, dark rosewood pearl coat, and two new colors--deep amethyst pearl coat and bright platinum pearl coat which will replace iris pearl coat and opal satin glow. On the inside a highland grain leather will be optional on Laredo, a saddle-moss green calf nap leather standard on Orvis, and a calf nap leather standard on the Limited with a choice of agate, medium mist gray and saddle. Dual air bags, dynamic side impact protection, the remote keyless entry system, power windows and doors, and power mirrors with illuminated controls return for 1997. The standard engine choices remain a 4.0l liter 6-cylinder and a 5.2 liter 8 cylinder. There may be other changes and additions, but Jeep doesn't have that information yet. To be put on the mailing list for the '97 Grand Cherokee Limited, call Jeep at 1-800-533-7324. </P></TD></TR>


<TR><TD><A NAME="a14">When you say that you're looking for the "Consumer Reports catalogue," we'll assume what you need is the New Car Buying Guide for '96. I called Consumer Reports and they said that this paperback book was available on newsstands in June 1996, so you should be able to get a copy. To order a Consumer Reports book you can call 515-237-4903, but they assured us it was widely available in June. </P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="a11">People used to think that leasing was just for businesses, but that has certainly changed. The decision to lease or buy a new car really depends on your individual circumstances--it's cost-effective and attractive for some, but not for others. For instance, if you're the kind of person who really wants or needs a new car every couple of years, it can be the right decision. However, if you put a lot of miles on your car (more than 12,000-15,000) every year, it may not be the right move because there are usually financial penalties for driving extra miles. Leasing has become a more attractive option lately because many car manufacturers are offering terms and incentives that appeal to the smart consumer. This is primarily because the used car market is very strong and they can turn a larger profit by reselling leased cars--which generally maintain  a high resale value. <P>

<P>Leases are also more affordable on the front-end because you are essentially financing the difference between what a vehicle costs today and what it's value will be at the end of the lease. That is called the residual value.</P>

<P>We consulted Cadillac's leasing department and they would only quote general, ball-park terms on leasing a new DeVille, the actual terms vary based on the car you choose, the dealership you work out your agreement with, and, of course, how much money you put down. </P>

<P>Currently, Cadillac is offering a lease incentive on the DeVille that runs through Oct. 2, 1996. (For updated incentives and terms call Cadillac at 1-800-333-4223.)  The lease is on a standard DeVille with an MSRP of $37,950, and is figured as a 24-month lease. The down payment is $3,175, with monthly payments of $469 and a security deposit of $475. (There's also Cadillac's "Smart Lease" option, where you make all your payments for the two year period up front ($13,594 down) and pay a security deposit of $575.) These figures do not include taxes. Cadillac could only quote figures based on a two-year lease (about 90% of their car leases are for two years), but one-, two-, three-, and four-year leases are also available. You can put up to 15,000 miles per year on the car, and the penalties for overages is 15 cents a mile--a fee they often take out of your security deposit. The leases come with a 4-year/50,000-mile warranty. </P>

<P>We also called a dealer for a Cadillac lease quote. They offered a total drive-off down payment of $5,400 which included the first month payment, security deposit ($2,200), tags, license and taxes. Payments were $489/month for 24 months, with 15,000 miles per year, and an 8 cent penalty per mile after that. </P></TD></TR>


<TR><TD><A NAME="a9"><P>Your question is whether your transaxle is covered longer than the 3 year/36,000 mile bumper-to bumper warranty.  There often is a difference between a bumper-to-bumper warranty and the drive-train warranty. It can be confusing. </P>
<P>We checked with several dealers and they claimed that the 1992 Sable's drive-train coverage is the same as the 3 year/36,000 miles coverage. However, when we spoke to Ford, they said that the confusion stems from the fact that the warranty coverage for the Sable was changed in the middle of 1992. Hence, the coverage you are entitled to really depends on which part of the year your car was produced in.</P> 
<P>Earlier in 1992, there was an additional 4 year/50,000 mile limit for the drive-train (which includes your transaxle), but it was changed to the more limited bumper-to-bumper cut-off  at about mid-year. To determine if you're covered, you would need to provide Ford with your specific vehicle identification number (VIN) and proceed from there. Contact Ford at 1-800-392-FORD for more information. </P></TD></TR>


<TR><TD><A NAME="a10">
<P>BMW headquarters had very little specific information on the new '97's, but that information might be available by the end of August or early September. You can call BMW at 1-800-334-4BMW for updates.  
The 1997 Z-3 will go into production in October, and will probably be available in November or December. 
The one change they are aware of is the availability of a V-6 model. In '96 there was only a 4-cylinder available. When asked whether there would be an automatic convertible top, they indicated that this car was, and still intends to be, a classic sports roadster--a simple and uncomplicated ragtop. </P>

<P>Your dealer has told you that all Z-3's have to be ordered directly from your dealer to the factory in Spartansburg, South Carolina, and, in a sense, he's right. This car is so incredibly popular that they have been completely back-ordered for some time, so, while it is not the official policy of BMW that you have to order them individually, demand has simply made that the unfortunate case. Dealers were initially allotted a certain number of Z3s and they quickly disappeared. </P>

<P>This wild popularity and the problem of the backlog in orders affects whether you will save money by buying a '96 now, rather than waiting for the '97's. This is because the people waiting for 1996 Z-3s will more than likely be first on the waiting-list for '97. Therefore it seems unlikely that there will be any discounts and deals available.</P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="a1">Although the nuts and bolts specifics about the 1997 Dodge Caravan aren't officially available, the people at Dodge did say that there would be all-wheel drive (AWD) available on some versions of the '97 Caravan. AWD will be available on those Caravans with the 3.8-liter engine (the bigger engine--higher trim-level version), including the Grand Caravan LE and the Caravan LE. The four lower trim-level versions (Grand Caravan SE, Grand Caravan, Caravan SE and Caravan) will not be available with AWD. <P>


According to Dodge, the AWD van would be at the dealerships by the first week in October. That would be a good time to start checking with your dealer and doing some comparison shopping with the Ford, Chrysler, or GM vans you might be considering. <P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="a2">The people at Chrysler stated that push-button all-wheel drive will be available for 1997 in the Town & Country line of minivans. This AWD should be available on both the short- and long-wheelbase versions of the Town & Country. <P>


Chrysler said that this AWD 1997 Town & Country should be available some time in the Fall--possibly October. You can call 1-800-4A-Chrysler for updated information on '97 minivans. 
<P></TD></TR>


<TR><TD><A NAME="a3">Chrysler doesn't seem to have any firm plans for making a Suburban-like truck in the near future. One dealer we spoke to said resolutely, "No" and indicated that Chrysler didn't have the production facilities for it. Another dealer said you might see something in the next three years and that there has been some discussion of building a Chrysler product that would be full-sized like the Blazer or Grand Wagoneer.<P>
Ford, on the other hand, has already released a somewhat comparable vehicle called the Ford Expedition. This SUV is slightly smaller than the Suburban, but is available now. Next year, Lincoln will introduce the Navigator, a vehicle designed to compete with high-end models like the Toyota Forerunner.</A><P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="a4"> Honda doesn't release information about new models until the vehicle is actually introduced--usually around the second week of October.</A><P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="a5"> The 97 Buick Park Avenue Ultra will be introduced in October and reviews should follow quickly. Car and Driver did a preview of it in the May 1996 issue--it won't be fully reviewed until it ships.</A><P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="a6">Service bulletins are constantly updated and go directly from Ford's engineers to the dealership. However, if your local Ford dealer can't supply them to you, call Helm Inc., a company that publishes not only Ford's but all other auto manufacturer's service reports. Call Helms Inc. at 1-800-782-4356.</A><P></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A NAME="a7"> There will be two new colors introduced for the forthcoming 1997 Chrysler Town & Country LXi. Currently, there are ten colors available for the 1996 model and Chrysler will probably discontinue one or two for 1997. Word is the new colors will be "Deep Amethyst," a grape or wine color, and "Tempo Forest," a forest green with a frost metallic finish that gives it a kind of pearl-like olive tone. Both sound unusual and pretty striking.</A><P>
</TD></TR>






<TR><TD><A NAME="a8"> <P>The arrival date of new models in the automobile industry seems--almost like the Christmas shopping season--to get earlier and earlier every year. In fact, some new models like the 1997 Ford F-150 were introduced a year ahead of time! This means that some 1996 cars are being cleared already. Generally, new models are introduced in September, a time that has traditionally marked the beginning of the new year for the automotive world. 
Regardless of when they actually hit the dealer lot, the arrival of the new 1997 models has a significant effect on pricing and the deals a smart consumer can get.</P>




<P>Here's how it works: Most dealers finance new shipments with a financial institution--they don't write checks to, say, Chrysler and Toyota. The finance charge for those loans is called a "flooring fee," a fee they pay as long as the car is actually on the lot. Simply having cars on their lot costs each dealer money. For instance, if a Jeep dealer gets 300 brand-new '97 Cherokees in and they've still got 100 '96 models languishing on the lot, that dealer is under a great deal of pressure to get rid of them. </P>




<P>A common complaint you might hear on the 'inside' at a car dealership is that their "inventory is out of whack," meaning they've got too much inventory. The arrival of 97 models puts pressure on dealers to make the cars increasingly cheaper until the end of the year. 
The smart consumer should shop early enough to find the car they want while still taking advantage of the clearance mode.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>

<CENTER><H2>Mini-SUVs Make A Big Splash</H2></CENTER><P>

<BR>


<P>Sport utility vehicles are all the rage these days. Unfortunately, some of that rage comes from prospective buyers who've not only experienced sticker shock, but have gone into full arrest. Take the omnipresent Ford Explorer, for example. Although the base price for a 2-door, 4x2 model is under $21,000, it's possible to spend up to $40,200 (including destination charge) for the Eddie Bauer All-Wheel Drive edition. </P>
<P>Now, that $40,000 figure includes such options as voice-activated cell phone, moon roof and other toys, but the fact is sport utility vehicles are as much status symbols in the Nineties as luxury sedans were in the Eighties. They've become cash cows for manufacturers, too. It is said that GM makes 100 percent profit on each Suburban it sells. 
For the entry-level consumer, choices are few: Buy a used sport utility, or consider one of the new crop of mini-sport utility vehicles. We'll examine the three biggest players in this up-and-coming segment; Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Geo Tracker. Despite their diminutive dimensions, the mini-SUVs have much to offer. Each is nimble, rugged and economical. They also have the trendy good looks of larger sport utes, but most of all, they're all priced for the cash-strapped off-roader.</P>
<P>Although these vehicles don't represent the profit margins of their larger siblings, they attract first time buyers -- a customer base that's as important as a fat bottom line to manufacturers. You see, getting Joe Q. Collegegrad into a RAV4 means he's more likely to trade up for a 4Runner or other Toyota product. </P>
<P>As trucks continue to grow in popularity, expect the segment to keep reaching down to entry-level buyers. Ford is expected to launch a mini-ute before too long, as are other import manufacturers. But, for now, here's the cream of the crop:</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>Honda CR-V</FONT></B><BR>
Beneath the boxy, but muscular, body of Honda's mini-sport ute lies the soul of a Civic. That's right, this "truck" is based on Honda's popular Civic passenger car platform. It's a sturdy foundation, however, and its car-like ride will be most appreciated by those who spend most of their drive time on the freeway, rather than mountain passes.</P>
<P>Typical of a Honda product, the CR-V includes some thoughtful touches and some great technology. The 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine under the hood is the most powerful of the bunch, with 126 horsepower. CR-V's 4-speed automatic transmission features "grade logic," which means a computer senses the grade of a hill and decides which gear is best, thereby reducing the transmission's tendency to "hunt" between gears. Also, the CR-V offers standard all-wheel drive, which transfers torque to all wheels whenever excessive slip is detected in the primary drive wheels.</P>
<P>As for standard features, CR-V offers standard air conditioning, power windows and locks, cup holder and a two-way tailgate/glass hatch combination. Oh, yeah, it comes with a portable picnic table, too. That should make tailgate parties a little more comfortable, but it points to CR-V's true nature as a suburban lifestyle shuttle, rather than a back woods trail blazer. </P>
<P><B>PRICE RANGE: </B>$17,500-$19,500 (Estimated prices -- actual prices not available at time of publication.)</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>Toyota RAV4</FONT></B><BR>
 Like the CR-V, Toyota's RAV4 is based on a passenger car platform. This time, the Corolla platform served as the foundation on which to build an attractive sport-ute. And, attractive it is. Of our trio, the RAV4 gets the nod for best looks. This is one vehicle you'd want to drive to the beach, a first date or even a 10-year class reunion. 
The RAV4 provides choices unavailable in the CR-V, including 2- and 4-door models, along with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The all-wheel drive system is similar to CR-V's, in that it drives through two wheels until traction demands all wheels. It's a full-time system, too, so the driver doesn't have to shift into "all-wheel drive" mode.
Under the hood is a 120-horsepower, 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. It's a willing powerplant, but a 4-door RAV4 can weight over 2,800 pounds, so much of the engine's spirit is absorbed by the drivetrain as it tries to push the relatively heavy vehicle down the road. Correspondingly, the RAV4 has only a 1,500-pound towing capacity -- enough for a loaded personal water craft trailer.</P>
<P>Although the RAV4 won't win any drag races, it is nonetheless a fun vehicle. Dual sunroofs are available on 2-door models, which provide a breezy, open driving experience. They aren't available on the 4-door, which is a shame. Dual air bags are standard, as is a rear window defogger and side-door guard beams. Interestingly, three cup holders are included with the 2-door, but only one cup holder is built into the 4-door models.</P> 
<P>Like the CR-V, the RAV4 is more about profiling than off-roading. For those who desire true off-road adventures, a trip to the local Chevy/Geo dealership is in order.</P>
<P><B>PRICE RANGE:</B> $15,538-$18,688 (including destination charge).</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>Geo Tracker </FONT></B><BR>
It's been around since the Eighties and has attracted a small cult following among true off-roaders. Why? Because, the Tracker is small and nimble, making it easy to maneuver over or around off-road obstacles. Also, the Tracker is built like a real truck. Unlike the CR-V and RAV4, which are based on unitized, passenger car platforms, the Tracker is built on a perimeter frame. The benefits of this design include a stiffer chassis and isolation from the typical jars and jerks associated with off-road driving. Unfortunately, on pavement, this stiff setup transmits a choppy ride.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Tracker is the most primitive of this group. It's built like a truck and it rides like one. A high driving position and awkward shifter that sticks almost diagonally out of the center console do nothing to hide the fact that Tracker is a back-to-basics design. Recent updates have given the Tracker a fresh interior with dual air bags, but compared to the Toyota and Honda, the Geo is light years behind in ergonomics and comfort.</P>
<P>The Tracker also has the smallest engine and least horsepower of the group -- a 95-horsepower, 1.6-liter 4-cylinder. It's hooked to either a 5-speed manual transmission or a pair of available automatic transmissions. A 3-speed automatic is optional on 2-door models, while 4-door models get a 4-speed automatic. As for the Tracker's 4-wheel drive system, it's truck-like, too. Unlike the full-time all-wheel drive systems of the Toyota and Honda, Tracker's is a conventional transfer case. This means the system must be engaged manually into either 4-wheel low or 4-wheel high modes. Although comparatively primitive, the 2-speed transfer case offers off-road capability that simply cannot be matched by the CR-V or RAV4. Also, Tracker is available in just 2-wheel drive.</P>
<P>If you choose a 2-door Tracker, it comes in convertible form, while 4-door models are fixed hardtops. The convertible model is certainly a fun vehicle and seems designed for summer outings. The 4-door model is quite refined looking, and is aimed at older, more upscale buyers than the Generation X-aimed 2-door. Either way, the Tracker is the least expensive mini-sport ute in our comparison.</P>
<P>Although the Tracker isn't the newest or most refined entry in the mini-sport utility field, it offers the attributes of a true off-road vehicle. And, if that's an attribute you prioritize over trendy togs, then the Tracker deserves a look. </P>
<P><B>PRICE RANGE:</B> $13,755-$16,050 (including destination charge).</P>

<CENTER><H2>Midsize Mission</H2><BR>

<B>Domestic and Import Makers Vie for the "Best Selling" Title</B></CENTER>
<P>Although the image of the average 4-door, midsize family sedan portrayed by the various manufacturers is one sweetness and light, -- you know, the picture of a well-coifed family smiling because the burden of life's everyday chores is actually made enjoyable thanks to the family car -- the reality of selling those family haulers is far more ruthless. For the company that can claim bragging rights to the best selling car in the country, the opportunities to exploit the fact are virtually limitless.</P>
<P>Throughout the Eighties and Nineties, the race for number one was between Ford Taurus and Honda Accord, with the rest of the midsize field consisting of also-rans. Accord held the crown for years, but when Ford finally wrested it away in 1991, the company trumpeted the achievement with a parade of Tauruses through downtown Detroit. 
Times change, however. Taurus still holds the best-selling title, but a lukewarm-warm reception to its 1996 redesign slowed its momentum. Honda gained some ground, but not totally at the expense of Taurus itself. Honda dealers have thrown plenty of cash on the hoods of Accords to entice buyers -- forsaking a little profit to regain the thrown of "Best Sellingdom." It hasn't worked, though, as Taurus holds the crown for the 1996 model year.</P>
<P>Quietly, while Taurus and Accord lobbed rebates and incentives at civilians, Toyota Camry and Chevrolet Lumina sneaked onto the battlefield and have become strong contenders in the midsize war. Both Camry and Lumina sales were up dramatically in the 1996 model year -- with Camry within spitting distance of both Accord and Taurus. For the record, 378,144 Tauruses were sold in 1996, compared to 367,137 Accords. An impressive 354,035 Camrys went out the door in 1996, while 246,820 Luminas went to new homes. When Monte Carlo is added to the equation, which is what a two-door Lumina is called, the number jumps to almost 320,000. (Camry and Accord both offer 2-door models which are factored into total sales.)</P>
<P>Clearly, the 1997 model year will be much more cut-throat than the soft focus advertisements will lead you to believe. There's not a bad car in the bunch, so shop wisely and find the car that offers the features you demand. Here's how the big four contenders stack up for the 1997 model year:</P>

<P><B>Ford Taurus</B>: It was a combination of rounded looks and a steeper price tag that conspired against Taurus in '96, but neither diminishes the fact that it's a fine automobile. Some perceived that Taurus' rounded exterior made the car look small, but in reality it has the largest trunk of this quartet, as well as the most EPA-rated interior volume.
On the road, Taurus' ride is quiet, assuring and quite European in terms of steering response and suspension firmness. The interior is comfortable, though we still haven't gotten used to the ovoid center control pod. </P>
<P>The high-performance Taurus SHO was recently reintroduced, this time with V8 power, and its a joy to drive. No significant changes have been made to the remainder of the line for 1997. Although Taurus' price tag is a bit high for a non-luxury sedan, its overall package is one of comfort and generally excellent reliability.

<P><B>Chevrolet Lumina:</B> Plain and simple, Chevy's Lumina gets the job done. It offers 6-passenger seating, a raft of standard safety and convenience features, and a standard V6 engine with the most standard horsepower of this group. </P>
<P>Air conditioning is standard. Power door locks are standard. Theft-deterrent is standard. A tilt steering wheel is standard. Intermittent wipers are standard. Get the picture? Add them all together and they spell "value."</P>
<P>Unfortunately, they don't spell "driving excitement." Neighbors will think you've rented a new car, rather than bought one. But, if watching "Bullit" is as close to driving thrills as you want to get, then Lumina deserves consideration. Its 3.1-liter engine is a model of reliability and the car's overall fit and finish are above reproach. For the money, Lumina is hard to beat.</P>

<P><B>Honda Accord: </B>An all-new Accord is coming in 1998, and if you're a dyed-in-the-wool Hondaphile, you may want to put off buying a new car for a year. For 1997, Accord is essentially a carryover model. It's an older design than either Taurus or Lumina, but every bit as contemporary. </P>
<P>Although it offers V6 power, Accord's standard engine is 2.2-liter 4-cylinder. At 145, the horsepower rating is the same as Taurus, but the 4-banger just doesn't have the torque to pull Accord up to speed with authority. Also, compared to Taurus, Lumina and Camry, the Honda's cabin is a bit squeezed.</P>
<P>Now, don't get us wrong -- the nits we've picked with Accord are akin to criticizing a silver medalist. There are intangible qualities about Accord that are impossible to quantify. The feel of the controls, the sound of a closing door and the almost assured lack of time that will be spent in a service department are qualities that must be experienced to be appreciated. We just wish the Accord was a tad larger inside.</P>

<P><B>Toyota Camry:</B> The Camry is all new for 1997, including slightly larger overall dimensions. However, like the Camrys that came before it, the new model suffers a chronic lack of personality. </P>
<P>Radical looks may not be a priority with family car buyers, but Camry's vanilla styling would have been stale five years ago. Likewise, the base 4-cylinder engine's 133 horsepower is adequate, but won't get anyone's blood boiling.</P>
<P>That Camry is seen as a transportation appliance seems to be just fine with Toyota's engineers and marketers, because no one has criticized the car for its utility, dependability or ergonomics. The car performs as promised and does so with benchmark reliability. Indeed, Camry may be the benchmark of midsize sedans.</P>
<P>Be careful when pricing the all-new Camry, however. The base CE comes standard with a 4-cylinder engine and 5-speed transmission for less than $17,000. But, air-conditioning costs a whopping $1,005, and the lowest price model that offers a V6 and an automatic (a/c is included) is the Camry LE. It'll set you back almost $23,000. All are included in Lumina's $17,495 price.</P>



<P><B>Wild Card:</B> Joining the Lumina in Chevy's midsize lineup for 1997 is Malibu (and a nearly identical GM sister, Oldsmobile Cutlass). It offers more trunk space and interior volume than Lumina, but is shorter overall. The styling is very import-influenced, too, looking kind of like a 1996 Camry. A 150-horsepower 4-cylinder engine is standard in the base model, while a V6 is optional. An automatic transmission and air conditioning are standard on all models.</P>
<P>Malibu is filled with unique touches, such as an ingenious cup holder on the left-hand side of the dashboard. The car is built on a chassis sturdy enough to rival luxury European makes in terms of stiffness, too.</P>
<P>Considering that the Corsica it replaces was the 11th best selling car for 1996, despite being a virtual non-entity at Chevrolet, the Malibu is poised to upset the balance of the midsize market. It will be priced to compete, too. In short, it's a well-thought out sedan that deserves serious consideration. </P>

<CENTER><H2>Reading a Dealer Invoice</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>There's a lot of noise about invoice pricing in the car industry. Several automobile information providers on the Internet, like Edmund's Buyers Guide and Microsoft CarPoint, offer dealer invoice prices as well as MSRPs. People are quick to point out that if you know the dealer invoice price, you'll get a better deal on a new vehicle. </P>

<P>Of course, this is true. However, invoices can be difficult to decipher, as they include information and terms that aren't defined.</P>

<P>We thought we'd walk you through a <A HREF="invoiceread.html">typical new vehicle invoice</A>--just so you know what's what.
</P>
Some points worth noting:<BR>


<UL>
<LI>Dealerships that sell high volume, know how take advantage of special factory incentives or are savvy marketers may be able to give you a better deal than ones that aren't. That's because such a dealer may qualify for <A HREF="invoiceread.html#specialadd">Special Added Discounts</A> or <A HREF="invoiceread.html#specialsavings">Special Bonus Savings</A> from the factory.
<LI>The most important information on an invoice might appear in the <A HREF="invoiceread.html#smallprint">small print</A>. Read it and you will discover that the invoice doesn't necessarily include all rebates, discounts and incentives from the manufacturer.
</UL>

<CENTER><H2>Recalls: Must Dealers Follow?</H2></CENTER>





<P><I><FONT SIZE=4>Editor's Note: Some questions the Weekly AutoMarket Report receives are of interest to all our readers. The following from Kenneth J. Zion is one such question:</FONT></I><BR>

(Check out the <A HREF="dealers.html">Insider Info</A> page for more.) </P>

<P>Do dealers have to follow the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) recalls, or can they ignore them if they don't feel like making the repairs? There's a recall on my '92 Camaro regarding the shift cable, but Chevy says there is no recall even though my car falls under the affected manufacturing dates. Is there any information about this?
</P>
<CENTER><HR WIDTH=65% SIZE=4></CENTER>

<P>To find out if a recall is issued on your car, contact the Auto Safety Hotline (an offshoot of the Department of Transportation) at 1-800-424-9393. They can tell you what's been recalled in your model year. We made that call and it appears that there are two recalls potentially affecting your Camaro--one concerning the shift cable (on an automatic) and one related to the "filler neck" on the fuel tank. 
However, recalls don't necessarily apply to every vehicle in a model year. For example, a recall can apply to just 150 vehicles made in a certain plant, or only one model from a specific plant. In order to be certain about your rights, you'll need to provide your vehicle identification number (VIN) to the manufacturer or the Safety Hotline. By doing so, it can be determined if your vehicle falls under the "scope" of this recall. If your car is not included in the recall but is experiencing problems, the NHTSA will want to know. Engineers at NHTSA constantly collect information and investigate these issues to make sure they've gotten the scope of the problem correct. (FYI: The NHTSA is a safety watchdog organization that investigates safety issues, they don't handle performance recalls.)
</P>
<P>Once the NHTSA has investigated a problem and mandated a recall, a dealer must honor that official recall and remedy the problem. </P>

<P>Before the recall is announced, however, there's quite a bit of wrangling and arm-twisting between the manufacturer and the NHTSA. The manufacturer can disagree and fight the recall by petition. But once the recall is accepted by the industry--and most are--they must honor it. (This rarely goes to court--only two cases in a number of years.) To facilitate the recall, the manufacturer sends a technical service bulletin directly to each dealer, notifies consumers, and fixes the problem free of charge. They are also obligated to notify you if an investigation is underway.</P>

<P>Beware that even after a recall has been formalized there can often be a delay in fixing your car's problem. A representative at NHTSA gave us a personal example: The ignition switch on his Lincoln was recalled because it potentially started fires. He received the recall information, but the replacement components and the instructions for making the repairs took another three months to arrive at the dealers. Sometimes it may appear that dealers are lying about not being able to fix a recall problem, when they are really just suffering an honest delay. It takes time for engineers to figure out how a problem can be fixed. 
</P>

<CENTER><H2>Customer Satisfaction Index Ratings</H2></CENTER>



<P>If you've bought a new car within the past couple years, you were most likely deluged with surveys--both via mail and telephone--that asked the same basic question: How well were you treated during the sale/service of your new car? </P>





<P>Automotive manufacturers are making customer satisfaction a top priority these days. That means today's car dealers (and the manufacturers themselves) are being held to a higher degree of integrity than ever before. Which, of course, translates into a more positive arena for the buyer when he or she hits the car lots--or even buys a car via the Internet. </P>





<P>Although each manufacturer has a different way of surveying and determining customer satisfaction levels, J.D. Power and Associates Car Satisfaction Index Study (CSI), which analyzes owner satisfaction levels after one year of ownership, offers a basic synopsis of the industry's customer satisfaction levels.
The 1995 CSI shows marked improvements over the previous years and, according to J.D. Power, "The industry's CSI gains this year can be traced primarily to improvements in dealership handling of customers."</P>





<P>Much like internal Customer Service Index surveys done by manufacturers, the J.D. Power CSI is comprised of two basic measures: Customer Handling which analyzes how owners feel about the way they were treated by their dealership; and Vehicle Repair/Reliability which looks at owner experiences with their vehicles over the first year of ownership.</P>



<B>Manufacturers Make CSI Count</B><BR>



<P>The manufacturers we spoke to say that customer service is their number one priority. Each manufacturer has a different way of rating dealer performance, but all agree that customer satisfaction is the most important factor.</P>




<P>For instance, Mazda publishes their dealer ratings in a weekly newsletter that goes out to all their dealers to help motivate them to keep up with the "Joneses," so to speak.</P>




<P>According to KIA's Manager of Public Relations, Geno Effler, "KIA has at least nine contacts with a new owner within their first two years of ownership." KIA says that prospective dealers must have an above average CSI form the manufacturers they are already dealing with in order to be awarded a KIA dealership.</P>




<P>Ford's Focus on Standards is a program that rates Ford dealers on a monthly basis. Ford outlines numerous Sales and Service Standards dealers must follow, including courteously acknowledging customers within two minutes of arrival and a "pleasant, no-pressure purchase experience".</P>



<B> Poor Customer Satisfaction </B><BR>



<P>What happens to a dealer that gets a consistently poor customer satisfaction rating? According to manufacturers and dealers we spoke to, a lot of pressure is put on dealers who aren't making the grade. Because manufacturers ultimately decide a dealer's fate, they are in the power position and can exert their powers in ways that can hurt a dealer. For instance, if a dealer isn't meeting a manufacturer's expectations, the dealer may be subject to limited vehicle allocation. 
Additionally, dealers with low customer satisfaction ratings are typically passed over when it comes to opening another dealership. The manufacturers just won't grant it to them. As one of our sources put it, "A dealer's future is truly limited by how good the satisfaction is at his store today."</P>


<B> 
Bottom Line</B><BR>



<P>Car buyers have it better today than they did ten years ago. There's no longer a reason to feel at the mercy of a dealer. In fact, the automotive industry is fast becoming a true service industry--where the customer is the boss.</P>




<P>This push for credibility has helped paved the way for alternative means of purchasing vehicles, like buying them via the Internet. The CSI ratings mean that companies like Auto-By-Tel, the largest Internet program where you can buy or lease a new car or truck, can gather top-notch dealers under one electronic roof that customers can easily reach by turning on their computers and logging on.
</P>

<CENTER><H2> Anti-Theft Devices and Vehicle Recovery Systems</H2></CENTER>
<P>


<I>by Cassandra Cavanah</I><P>





<P>From standard alarms that scream and screech when a car goes bump in the night to highly sophisticated devices that use state-of-the-art Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites to track stolen cars, the automobile anti-theft device market is a large and growing one.
One of the major reasons for this growth? Escalating auto theft. According to some statistics, auto theft is an $8 billion industry.</P>



<B>Insurance Benefits</B><BR>



<P>You can't predict whether or not your car will be stolen, but, installing an anti-theft device should lessen the chances. At least that's what insurance companies are banking on when they offer discounts to owners of vehicles with certain anti-theft devices installed. 
Depending on the state and county which you live in, as well as which insurance company you're dealing with, you can be assured that you will receive some type of discount off the comprehensive portion of your vehicle insurance if your car is equipped with an anti-theft device. In fact, some insurance companies allow up to a 35% discount when you combine an anti-theft device, like an alarm with a vehicle recovery system, like LoJack.
</P>


<B>At the Dealer</B><BR>


<P>
Today's car buyers have it fairly easy when it comes to purchasing anti-theft devices. First of all, most  mid- and upper-end car lines come with basic alarms pre-installed, and dealers charge a minimum fee to install an alarm on lesser-priced car models. You can also opt to upgrade the pre-installed alarm to one with automatic car locks, etc. for around $100.</P>




<P>If you feel your vehicle requires more than a basic alarm systems, there are other anti-theft devices available at the dealer level. We inquired with local dealers in Southern California and found there are a couple of popular anti-theft devices available here. 
One product is an anti-start device from Corum Co. Though not extremely sophisticated--it requires the use of two keys to start the vehicle--it's affordable and effective. The Corum product should cost buyers no more than $100, however dealers have been known to charge up to $400.</P>




<P>Another popular device in the Southern California area is LoJack. LoJack is a vehicle recovery system  that dealers sell for around $600 (their cost is a little under $400).</P>



<P>
Auto manufacturers are already making plans to beef-up standard auto-theft devices. In fact, Ford has already introduced a new system, called PATS (Passive Anti-Theft System), that comes standard in the 1996 Taurus LX, Taurus SO and Mercury Sable LS models. With PATS, a small transmitter is embedded in the ignition key and a receiver in the ignition checks the key's code. If the code that's transmitted isn't right, the engine shuts down completely.</P>



<B>Vehicle Recovery Devices</B><BR>



<P>Vehicle recovery devices are the "glamour" anti-theft devices of the 90s. Products like LoJack, which works hand-in-hand with the police department to recover stolen vehicles, and a new device called OnGuard, which uses sophisticated satellite positioning software to track vehicles anywhere in the world, are gaining popularity.
If you own an extremely expensive vehicle, these devices might offer the kind of protection you feel you require. However, those with less valuable cars, might be less likely to want to recover a vehicle after its been picked over by professional auto thieves. As one dealer we spoke to said, "If my car's been stolen, I don't want anyone to find it."</P>




<B>The Low-Down on LoJack</B><BR>



<P>LoJack is a small box that is installed in your car and sends transmissions to police tracking computers. According to LoJack competitors there are numerous drawbacks to the LoJack system. First of all, your vehicle is only traced once you report it stolen. This means if a car is stolen at midnight and you don't report it until 7:00 a.m., the thieves have a seven-hour jump on the police. </P>




<P>Another potential drawback is that LoJack relies on police cooperation to work. Only police cars that are equipped with the LoJack tracking device (and not all of them are) can track the stolen vehicle. Still, LoJack's recovery rates are high--94%--and LoJack refunds the cost of the system if your stolen vehicle isn't found within 24 hours of the theft report.</P>




<P>LoJack's availability is fairly wide-spread, however it only works in the area in which it was purchased. In the U.S., you can find LoJack in Florida, New Jersey, Michigan, California, Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, New York, Washington D.C., Connecticut and Rhode Island. International readers can find the same technology in the United Kingdom, Greece, Ecuador, Columbia, Czech and Slovak Republics and Hong Kong, under the names of CarSearch and Tracker by LoJack.</P>



<B>OnGuard Personal Security and Vehicle Tracking System</B><BR>



<P>A new product that plans to go head-to-head with LoJack is the OnGuard System from ATX Research, Inc. This Texas-based company uses Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites to let distressed drivers call for help or authorities track their stolen cars.
OnGuard requires a cellular phone installed in the vehicle (not a handheld model). The driver must enter a passcode on the cellular phone handset when starting the car or the tracker activates and the OnGuard Response Center begins tracking the vehicle. In addition, a "panic" button lets users call for emergency help and authorities know exactly where the driver is located.</P>




<P>Although OnGuard is initially being sold in Texas, New Orleans, Chicago and St. Louis, the very nature of GPS, a system of satellites originally used by the government for defense purposes, makes this a product of national scope. This means if your vehicle was stolen in Los Angeles and shipped to Singapore, OnGuard would still be able to track it.
Unlike LoJack which has just a one-time fee, OnGuard costs around $700 and requires a monthly fee of about $15.00.</P>



<B>Bottom Line</B>


<P>Though many of these devices are available as after-market add-ons, it makes sense to take advantage of the convenience that buying them from the dealer offers. Not only do you avoid the hassles of shopping around, but--now that you've learned a little more about them from reading this article--you'll be able to use these devices as bargaining chips during your next purchase, getting the dealer to add them on at little or no extra cost.</P>

<H2>Car Sales Strategies</H2><BR>







<P>Everyone knows how it feels to buy a new car off a lot. It's that "me against them" feeling. You're sure the car salesperson is out to get you personally. 
</P>



<P>Well, it's not really that cut and dried. In reality, the salesperson only cares about the sale. What happens to you personally is not an issue. 
This phenomenon isn't new. It's something that has been cultivated by decades of pressure to make the sale. Salespeople are under a tremendous amount of pressure not only from their own managers and dealerships, but also from the automobile manufacturers. Sales are the bottom line--and salespeople will usually do anything it takes to make the sale.</P>




<P>Here are brief descriptions of four often-used selling systems. Any one of which you may have encountered when buying a car.</P>





<P><B>1. The Straight Sell:</B><BR>

This strategy is probably the easiest to deal with--it's also rarely encountered. It refers to a sale that is made by one person, meaning the buyer deals with one salesperson throughout the entire sale. There is no one "backing" him up. This obviously means the buyer is less likely to feel "ganged up" on. Your most likely to find straight sell scenarios on small or exclusive lots.</P>





<P><B>2. Straight Sell with a Desk:</B><BR>

This is a very common practice. This is where you deal with one person up until the time he goes to the "desk" to get a final decision. Here the buyer feels pressure from some unknown force and the salesperson gets to play the good guy.</P>





<P><B>3. TO or Turn Over:</B><BR>

This is typical of dealerships with either inexperienced salespeople or one that wants to exert a high pressure to make the sale. In such a situation, you may be in for a surprise when the nice, accommodating twenty-year-old salesperson turns you over to a more experienced and, ultimately, less-accommodating sales guy.</P>





<P><B>4. One-Price Selling:</B><BR>

Depending on the climate, one-price selling can be good or bad for the buyer. There's no haggling involved, which is always nice. But, since there's no haggling involved, the buyer can get a raw deal. If you're an informed buyer and know the basic pricing information, you should be able to determine whether or not you're getting a good value.</P>





<P><B>Four Square: This is No Playground</B><BR>

Four square is a very common sales tactic that can be used during any one of the above sales techniques. It works like this: the salesperson outlines four elements of the deal to the buyer--price, payment, down payment and trade-in value. Then he shows you the numbers, waiting for a strong reaction to one of them.</P>




<P>The clincher here is that all four of the numbers are actually bad--meaning they all can be worked on. Here, the dealer plays the psychological card and only works with you on the number that seems to upset you the most. For instance, you may say, "Hey, wait a minute. My trade-in is worth way more than that." The salesperson then hones in on the trade-in cost, making you promise to make a deal if he gets the number right.</P>




<P>The mistake the buyer makes here is getting too focused on one of the numbers and forgetting to negotiate the three other areas.</P>





<P><B>Bottom Line</B><BR>

Because the automotive industry is so competitive, dealers are constantly trying to motivate their salespeople and keep them enthused about their jobs. That usually means creating new sales tactics to keep the process fresh.</P>




<P>Automotive sales are changing, but many old-school sales tactics still hold true. If you're an educated buyer, you can minimize the potential of being trapped by these tactics. Remember: no matter what system a salesperson is using, he always has someone backing him up. That means you as a buyer must be well-informed and do plenty of research to get the upper hand in the negotiations.</P>




<P>The onset of new and improved modes of car-buying methods (via online services like Auto-By-Tel, for example) should give the power and control back to the buyer by taking away the dealer's home court advantage.</P>

<CENTER><H2>Automotive Publications Online</H2></CENTER>


<P><I>We take a look at a few interesting sites that are dedicated to bringing readers automotive news and information. These reviews reflect the appearance of the pages under Netscape 2.0</I></P>





<P><B>AutoWeek Online or A.W.O.L.</B><BR>

http://www.autoweek.com/<BR>

AutoWeek Online claims to be <I>the</I> source for current automotive information. The site is somewhat moody and dark and pretty uneven in terms of design and layout. I also found it confusing - what is A.W.O.L exactly?</P>

 


<P>The only data I found were specialized classifieds that lists everything a hard-core auto enthusiast might be looking for and a table of contents for the current paper-based AutoWeek. There were no articles at the site. I "subscribed" to A.W.O.L. and am assuming some sort of newsletter will come to my mailbox each week. We'll see.</P>




<P>They also have some screen savers for the ultimate car nut and some interesting links to automotive sites that you might otherwise never know existed, like the RepoMan Nationwide Directory.
A.W.O.L. is not for the timid.</P>




<P>
<B>Popular Mechanics Automotive or PM Automotive</B><BR>

PM Automotive is much, much more mainstream than AutoWeek Online. Here you'll find beautiful photos of new cars and prototype models. The Spy Report section looks at prototypes that are still "under wraps," while Owner Reports give readers the inside scoop on real-life automotive experiences.</P>




<P>A feature titled 1996 New Cars provides in-depth information on what's happening in Detroit these days and reviews of the 1996 models, along with color photos.</P>




<P>If you're in search of a new car, check this site out.</P>

A Daily Auto Insider section features news and views of the auto industry, while On The Newsstand includes much of the current Car and Driver issuecomplete with photos and top-notch design. Internet-specific information is also there, including a chat area and a section that lists the preferred Car and Driver automotive web sites.</P>

<CENTER><H2>Automotive Information on the Web</H2></CENTER>



<P><I>We decided it was time to take a crawl around the Web to inform readers about the various automotive information sites available on the Internet. This week we look at the growing number of "information brokers" that offer invoice pricing and other tips for purchasing a car. In weeks to come we'll focus on automotive-oriented magazines and newspapers, sites designed and operated by car manufacturers and more.
</I></P>





<P><B>AutoSite</B><BR>
http://www.autosite.com/welcome.htm.<BR>

AutoSite is definitely the most fun to use site reviewed here. It's got great graphics and an easy-to-use interface. They've put the concept of "interactive Web page" to good use. </P>




<P>As AutoSite explains in their literature, they're in the business to sell information, so they don't just give away all the important stuff. But there is plenty of free information, including invoice prices on all makes and models of new vehicles, FaceOff comparison reports between models, consumer-advisory articles, recall announcements and more. They also have a unique "Now on the Newsstand" section that lets you look up capsule reports of the current cars/trucks being reviewed in magazines on the newsstand. (Past issues are also included.) This is a great database to turn to when you want to find out what the experts are saying about the vehicle you're interested in. 
What you pay AutoSite for are reports that give you the nitty-gritty on the car of your choice, including dealer invoice pricing, specs, options, residual values, warranty info, reviews, etc. The reports are $6.95 and are said to be very current. They also offer Book Values on used cars for just $1.95.</P>




<P>This site is definitely worth a visit if you're in the market for a new car or are just a general auto enthusiast (check out AutoSite's Garage section for details on maintenance procedures and an automotive encyclopedia).</P>





<P><B>Edmund's Automobile Buyer's Guides</B><BR>

http://www.enews.com/magazines/edmunds/<BR>

Edmund's offers a lot of the same information you can find on AutoSite, but the bulk of it is free. Though the interface isn't nearly as charming, the information you want is easy to find and easy to read. Look up the vehicle of your choice-either new or used-and you'll find the dealer invoice price as well as the MSRP. After seeing those two figures, you can hope to find a dealer to sell you a car as close to his price as possible. You'll also get an extensive list of options and a review of the vehicle. Color pictures show what the vehicle looks like.
The Internet is just a new avenue for Edmund's information which can also be found in book and CD-ROM forms. A CD-ROM with all of Edmond's information can be purchased for under $10, while CDs with only car or truck info cost less than $7.00. (The CD-ROMs can be ordered a the Web site.)</P>




<P>Also included on the page is an informative industry newsletter called Tire Kicking Today. One odd-ball section is what Edmund's calls the Hottest Cars and Trucks on the Net-here, you are told which cars and trucks have been accessed the most by Edmund's users. 
</P>





<P><B>Kelley Blue Book</B><BR>

http://www.kbb.com/<BR>

The all-powerful Kelley Blue Book is slowly making its way to the Internet. The site is accessible now, but lacks any real pricing information. In the near future (three weeks or so for new cars, three months or so for used cars), you will be able to receive a $3.95 report on new car prices as well as a report on used car pricing.
The Blue Book's first Used Car Guide was published in 1926 and is still considered the definitive source of automotive pricing and value information, for new and used cars, trucks and vans.
It's a site certainly worth visiting, but you've got to wonder at its value given the tremendous amount of up-to-date info being offered by Edmund's and AutoSite already.</P>






<P><B>Microsoft CarSource</B><BR>

If you're looking at this page using Microsoft Network, then you have yet another service you can check out: Microsoft CarSource. CarSource is a comprehensive guide for new car and truck shoppers. It offers reports from IntelliChoice, a leader in automobile evaluation, that analyze vehicles based on the cost of ownership and operation over five years, rating them on depreciation, maintenance, repairs, etc. CarSource also has a search engine that lets users input specific criteria-like price range, safety features, etc.-and will then output a list of cars that matches a user's needs.</P>




<P>The CarSource interface is extremely graphical and interesting to use. By year's end, all Internet users should have access to this service.</P>

<CENTER><H2>Automotive Information on the Web<BR>
Manufacturer's Home Pages</H2></CENTER>



<P><I>Three weeks ago we took a look at the growing number of <A HREF="autoweb.html">"information brokers" </A>that offer invoice pricing and other tips for purchasing a car. This week we're looking at sites designed and operated by automobile manufacturers. (This is just a handful of the automotive manufacturers on the Web. We'll review more in the near future.)</I></P>






<P><B>General Motors</B><BR>

(http://www.gm.com)<BR>

When it comes to their Web site, General Motors is extremely cutting edge. They offer a Shockwave-enhanced version of their home page (http://www.gm.com/shockwav/) that we viewed after downloading Macromedia's Shockwave software (Shockwave will only work with Netscape 2.0). The Shockwave-enhanced page is fun to look at, including the short  video clip of a trip through the countryside, and listen to-jumping to another page elicits the sound of a car skidding to a halt. </P>




<P>GM's "Take a Spin" section lets you "drive" the car of your dreams using Apple's QuickTime VR program, another add-on program. Additionally, there are sound bites of GM employees espousing the GM mantra. Of course, GM also includes links to its brand pages, like Chevrolet, Geo, Pontiac, Buick, Cadillac and Saturn.
Overall, this page is only worth visiting for its "cutting-edge" use of technology and its link to the GM brand Web sites-the information you are  looking for will be found there.</P>




<P>
<B>Ford WorldWide Connection</B><BR>

(http://www.ford.com)<BR>

Ford, on the other hand, offers plenty of worthwhile info, while including its own brand of cutting-edge technology in the form of a live camera positioned at various auto shows (at the time of this writing,  the Geneva Auto Show was online). Ford lets you take a peek at what's going on on the show floor.</P>




<P>What we really like about the Ford WorldWide Connection is the financial advice/help it offers. We had lots of fun filling out the Financial Planner, a basic listing of expenses, to determine the car payment we could afford. But, even better, was the Interactive Calculator that lets you calculate the difference between the payments of vehicle you lease or purchase. Here, Ford includes the MSRP on its entire line of vehicles.</P>




<P>The Ford WorldWide Connection also features showrooms of Ford, Mercury, Lincoln and Jaguar cars, as well as plenty of company information.</P>




<P>The Ford site is definitely worth a stop.</P>





<P><B>Chrysler</B><BR>

(http://www.chryslercars.com)<BR>

Chrysler takes a no-nonsense approach to their Web site. Here you will find information on the Chrysler line-up, including MSRP and option pricing. Nice color pictures that can be made larger, if desired, give you a clean view of the vehicles.</P>




<P>There's also basic spec information that was probably taken directly from Chrysler's brochures. </P>



<P>
Though there are no cutting-edge bells and whistles nor any "added attractions," like Ford's financial information, the Chrysler page gets the job done.
</P>




<P><B>Honda</B><BR>

(http://www.honda.com/toc)<BR>

Honda's Web site looks good and works well. It's full of interesting tid-bits that will keep you cruising around its nooks and crannies for hours. We especially liked the "Color Your Car" feature that lets you play with all the exterior colors offered on various models. An extremely informative page includes current lease plans-along with monthly and down payment information-a must  for anyone thinking of leasing a Honda.</P>




<P>Also included is a QuickTime VR of Honda's new sports utility vehicle. Additionally, Honda makes it clear that they are dedicated to the American market by including a "Made in America" section that outlines the Honda plants in the U.S., as well as outlining Honda's history in the U.S. market.</P>





<P><B>Toyota</B><BR>

(http://www.toyota.com)<BR>

Toyota had the oddest content of all the manufacturer sites we visited. A section called "The Hub" offers seven or so electronic magazines-from LivingHome to Women's Web Weekly to A Man's Life-that reside on the Toyota server. Though some of the pubs were interesting, we were hard pressed to figure out just why they were there. All we could conclude is that Toyota is trying to make everyone feel at home in their electronic showroom. Somewhat bizarre, but cool.
In addition to "The Hub," there is plenty of general information about Toyota products to be found. Toyota will soon implement a worksheet to help users discover "Which Toyota is right for me?"</P>




<P>Toyota includes extensive information on all models, but you won't find any pricing info on the Toyota home page. 
</P>

<H2>Gas Mileage Comparisons</H2>

<I>We take a look at popular vehicles' gas mileage statistics. </I>



<P>Driving by gasoline stations these days and seeing prices anywhere from $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon (depending on where you live) can make even the most foolhardy cringe. Not only does the situation anger the average consumer, but it also puts a serious dent in his pocketbook. (U.S. consumer aren't the only ones effected by rising gas prices, an editorial by Graeme Fletcher in Canadian Carguide recently asked, "Why [is the government] so hesitant to tackle the petroleum industry?")</P>




<P>In California, where prices are at the highest and driving is a way of life, an average consumer who commutes thirty miles each day in a Ford Explorer is like to spend nearly $3.00 a day just to get to and from work. Over a month, that number adds up to nearly $60, and that doesn't even take into account weekend outings.</P>




<P>Money (or the lack of it) always seems to change people's perspectives. If we're lucky, the latest round of gas hikes may even prompt people to re-consider the fuel they use and could boost the popularity of alternative-fuel and electric vehicles that are slowly, but, surely being developed by auto makers.</P>




<P>Until then, we thought it a good time to remind everyone that good gas mileage counts when purchasing a new car or truck. 
</P>




<P>
<B>Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs)</B> are the most popular vehicles today, but they also happen to guzzle a lot of gas. We look at some of the top sellers, as well as the RAV 4, a small, more fuel-efficient newcomer from Toyota.</P>


<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=10>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Ford Explorer 2WD</B><BR>

</TABLE>



<P>The traditional sedan gets pretty decent gas mileage. The vehicles that we looked at average over 30 mpg on the highway, which means you won't be stopping off at the gas station as often as the SUV driver.
</P>


<B>Sedans</B><BR>

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=10>

<P>In the world of luxury, BMW and Mercedes reign supreme. Here's the kind of mileage you can expect from these top-of-the line sedans.</P>

<P>If you're truly concerned about gas mileage, turn to the traditionally fuel-efficient small cars. They may not offer the status or roominess of larger vehicles, but they'll surely save you a pretty penny at the pumps.</P>

<P><B>Canadian Consumers Can Buy Cars Online, Too!</B><BR>

<I>Auto-By-Tel recently opens its doors for business in Canada.
</I></P>
<P>Now Canadian car-buyers can take advantage of the same no-haggle, no-hassle automotive purchasing program that over 100,000 U.S. customers have used.  Auto-By-Tel has had a big hand in revamping the traditional automotive buying experience in the U.S. by partnering savvy auto dealers with well-informed, online car buyers.  </P>
<P>Peter Ellis, an Auto-By-Tel co-founder, notes, "The success of Auto-By-Tel illustrates that consumers are tired of the traditional car-buying experience.  What weve discovered is that todays consumer has a wealth of information available to him-including invoice pricing, current rebates, etc.-he doesnt want to get the runaround, he just wants to buy a car at an affordable price.  Dealers have been selling cars the same way for over 75 years, and Auto-By-Tel is focused on training dealers how to reinvent themselves for the customer of the next century."</P>
<P>Auto-By-Tel Canada is off to a strong start with numerous forward-thinking Canadian automotive dealers already signed on.  Canadian users are giving the program high marks as well.
Toronto-resident Sheryl Johnson exclaimed, "I was totally impressed.  The Auto-By-Tel dealer did not try to sell me up to a more expensive vehicle.  Not only did I get all the features I wanted at the price I wanted to pay, but I also got more-including a sunroof and automatic transmission.  There was no pressure and the whole deal was handled over the telephone.  My parents are looking for a new car-Ill be sure they use the Auto-By-Tel program!"</P>
<P>Auto-By-Tel expects 50,000 Canadian customers to submit Auto-By-Tel purchase requests by the end of 1996.</P>
<P>"Our first year of business in the U.S. was one of rapid expansion-consumer demand for the ABT program accelerated faster than we originally anticipated," said Ellis.  With that in mind, were positioned to meet a similar demand from value-conscious Canadian consumers."</P>
<P>The California-based Auto-By-Tel has been in business since March 1995 and refers customers to a network of 1,400 U.S.-based dealers that are dedicated to offering low, competitive pricing on new cars and trucks. </P>

<CENTER><H2>Hot 1996 Mercedes-Benz Models</H2></CENTER>
<IMG WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=82 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=20 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="mercy.gif">
<P><B>Mercedes-Benz E-Class</B><BR>

Base price: $41,145 - $52,145<BR>

Tech Specs: 3.0-liter DOHC 24-valve diesel 6-in-line, 134 hp; 3.2-liter DOHC 24-valve 6-in-line, 217 hp; 4.2-liter DOHC 32-valve V-8, 275 hp; 4- or 5-speed automatic</P>

<P>We've all seen one. And many have coveted one. The Mercedes-Benz E-Class. A car in a class of its own. It's retro, rounded headlights might make us think of good things gone by or good things to come.
The E-Class currently comes in three models: E300 Diesel; E320; and E420. The E420 is a V-8 with plenty of horsepower behind it.
Mercedes will also introduce a wagon based on the E-Class design in the fall of 1997. The wagon's price is projected to be about 15 to 20 percent above the E-Class sedan.</P>
<P>Still, even without the added room a wagon has to offer, the E-Class is much larger than its predecessor, offering almost two inches more kneeroom and 1.4 inches more shoulder room in the rear seat area. The E-Class also has a feature that most Americans feel is a necessity: cup holders for both the driver and passenger. </P>
<P>Car and Driver enthused, that the E-Class, "is more stylish, roomier, and quieter, and it has more standard and safety equipment. Yet it has not put on weight, something we would have expected lately from Mercedes. But the amazing aspect of the new car is that its price does not exceed the previous car's."</P>
<IMG WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=87 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=20 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="suv.gif">
<P><B>Mercedes-Benz M-Class</B><BR>

Base Price: mid-$30,000<BR>

Tech Specs: V6 and V8-powered engines with five-speed automatic transmissions.</P>

<P>This Mercedes-Benz SUV is not available yet, but with a price point that makes it affordable for the average SUV shopper, it's sure to be a hit. Mercedes says it designed the M-Class to offer true off-road capabilities and ruggedness, combined with safety, comfort, refinement and the on-road performance Mercedes-Benz passenger cars are known for. Called an All-Activity Vehicle, this SUV should be on sale in the U.S. in the fall of 1997. </P>
<P>Mercedes-Benz designers and engineers have put a lot of time into the development of the M-Class, making sure it meets all the needs of the typical high-end SUV buyer. Safety is a big issue for Mercedes-Benz, and the M-Class has the same levels of safety as the Mercedes passenger cars, including dual airbags and door-mounted side impact airbags.</P>

<P><B>1996 Chryslers</B><BR>

Chrysler has created some impressive models for 1996. Here we bring you pictures and short reviews of the Town and Country LXi and the Sebring Convertible.</P>

<A HREF="#lxi">Chrysler Town and Country LXi</A><BR>

<A HREF="#jx">Chrysler Sebring Convertible
</A><P>


<A NAME="lxi"><B>Chrysler Town and Country LXi</B></A>
<IMG WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=115 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="gfx/chrysler1.gif">
<P>Base Price: $24,960 - $30,605<BR>

Tech Specs: 3.3-liter pushrod 12-valve V-6, 158 hp; 3.8-liter pushrod 12-valve V-6, 166 hp; 4-sp automatic</P>

<P>Chrysler didn't forget what makes a great minivan when they put together the remodeled Town and Country for 1996. This minivan shrieks luxury from its dual-zone control heat/air conditioning to its eight-way leather trimmed driver and passenger with memory. Of course, two sliding doors also make this the minivan of choice for upscale minivan buyers.</P>
<P>The Town & Country comes in three models: a more, affordable but somewhat stripped-down base model, an "ultimate" LXi with features ordinarily found only on luxury cars, and the new short-wheelbase (113.3-inch) LX version. The latter version is compact enough to fit into the garage comfortably, and is able to turn in a much smaller radius than the larger version.</P>
<P>All the Town and Countrys can seat seven passenger and the seats are on wheels which makes them easy to remove and stow away when not in use.</P>

<A NAME="jx"><B>Chrysler Sebring Convertible JX/JXi</B></A>
<IMG WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=91 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=15 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="gfx/chrysler2.gif">
<P>Base Price: $21,000 - $23,000<BR>

Tech Specs: 2.4-liter DOHC 16-valve 4-in-line, 150 hp; 2.5-liter SOHC 24-valve V-6, 164 hp; 4-sp automatic.</P>
<P>Chrysler has finally dropped the old Le Baron Convertible--a tired model based on the K car design--and has replaced it with the stunning new Sebring Convertible JX/JXi. Though Chrysler has a Sebring coupe, this new convertible is not based on the coupe at all. Instead, it's based on the Cirrus sedan--but, not really. </P>
<P>With its power top and seatbelts fully integrated into the front seat, this convertible has the features you'd find in a much more expensive car, but, according to some reviewers, the Sebring's engine could use a power boost.</P>
<P>Car and Driver has this to say about the Sebring Convertible's engine:
"The JX comes with a 150-hp 2.4-liter four-cylinder, while the JXi arrives with a 164-hp 2.5-liter V-6. Both engines come only with a four-speed automatic transmission. The JXi has more creature comforts like electric seats and windows. This will be an image car for Chrysler, and we'd love to see it with one of the company's more powerful V-6s and a manual transmission. But such performance specials remain a dream at this point."</P>

<CENTER><P><B>Acheter une voiture sans probl&egrave;me et sans tracas sur l'Internet.</B></P></CENTER>



<P>Des recherches fastidieuses ont &eacute;puis&eacute; Arlene Johnson. D&eacute;nicher une voiture neuve &agrave; prix comp&eacute;titif lui semblait tout simplement impossible, et son
interminable tourn&eacute;e des concessionnaires lui laissait un souvenir
d&eacute;sagr&eacute;able. Arlene &eacute;tait sur le point de tout laisser tomber quand sa
soeur Sheryl d&eacute;couvre le site d'Auto-By-Tel sur l'Internet; un programme
d'achat de v&eacute;hicules automobiles. Sheryl n'avait aucune id&eacute;e de ce qu'il en
&eacute;tait mais savait fort bien qu'elle n'avait rien &agrave; perdre &agrave; remplir et &agrave; transmettre une demande d'achat ou de location &agrave; Auto-By-Tel.</P>

<P>Elle fut stup&eacute;faite quand le concessionnaire affili&eacute; &agrave; Auto-By-Tel l'a
contact&eacute; avec un prix d&eacute;risoire pour une toute nouvelle Hyundai Accent. Non
seulement sa soeur Arlene a &eacute;conomis&eacute; de l'argent gr&acirc;ce &agrave; Auto-By-Tel mais,
plus important encore, elle a sauv&eacute; beaucoup temps et bien des efforts
inutiles.</P>

<P>Sheryl, une analyste dans le milieu des affaires, explique : &#171; le syst&egrave;me
est simple, rapide et tr&egrave;s facile &agrave; utiliser. Le concessionnaire
Auto-By-Tel n'a pas essay&eacute; de vendre &agrave; Arlene une voiture plus ch&egrave;re que
celle qu'elle avait choisie. Non seulement Arlene a obtenu tous les
&eacute;quipements qu'elle d&eacute;sirait au prix qu'elle voulait payer, mais elle a eu
en plus un toit ouvrant et la transmission automatique. Il n'y a eu aucune
pression et tout s'est r&eacute;gl&eacute; par t&eacute;l&eacute;phone. &#187;</P>
	
<P>Arlene ne pouvait &ecirc;tre plus satisfaite par l'achat de sa premi&egrave;re voiture.
&#171;J'ai obtenu un prix fantastique et &ccedil;a  a &eacute;t&eacute; incroyablement facile,
d&eacute;clare-t-elle. Je n'ai eu qu'&agrave; m'asseoir &agrave; la maison et &agrave; transmettre ma
demande quand je l'ai voulu et sans m&ecirc;me mettre les pieds chez un
concessionnaire.&#187;</P>

<P>Auto-By-Tel connat d&eacute;j&agrave;  un vif succ&egrave;s aux &Eacute;tats-Unis quand ses dirigeants
d&eacute;cident d'offrir ce r&eacute;volutionnaire syst&egrave;me d'achat &eacute;lectronique aux
consommateurs canadiens et qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois. Le programme est tr&egrave;s simple &agrave; 
utiliser. Les consommateurs sont d'abord invit&eacute;s &agrave;  bien se documenter sur
le v&eacute;hicule de leur choix au moyen d'Internet (on peut facilement acc&eacute;der &agrave; 
plusieurs sites automobiles depuis le site bilingue d'Auto-By-Tel &agrave; 
l'adresse http://www.autobytel.com) et par la lecture de magazines
automobiles. Puis, les consommateurs soumettent une demande d'achat ou de
location &agrave;  Auto-By-Tel. Cette demande est achemin&eacute;e &agrave;  un concessionnaire
affili&eacute; &agrave;  Auto-By-Tel qui, dans un d&eacute;lais de 48 heures, transmet aux
consommateurs un prix bas et comp&eacute;titif pour ce v&eacute;hicule. Il n'y a aucune
n&eacute;gociation, ni argumentation, ni tracas. Ce programme est gratuit pour les
consommateurs et peut leur permettre d'&eacute;conomiser des milliers de dollars.</P>

<P>Les concessionnaires peuvent soumettre des prix tr&egrave;s comp&eacute;titifs aux
clients d'Auto-By-Tel car vendre un v&eacute;hicule gr&acirc;ce &agrave;  Auto-By-Tel leur
permet d'&eacute;conomiser d'importantes sommes d'argent en publicit&eacute; et en frais
g&eacute;n&eacute;raux. Geoff White, le g&eacute;rant de la concession Ken Shaw Lexus Toyota de
Toronto, explique que &#171; les consommateurs d'Auto-By-Tel sont d&eacute;j&agrave;  tr&egrave;s bien
inform&eacute;s et ne sont int&eacute;ress&eacute;s qu'&agrave;  r&eacute;aliser une excellente affaire. Nous
pouvons la leur offrir car nous ne perdons pas de longues heures &agrave;  n&eacute;gocier
avec eux. Il s'agit pour nous d'une faon fantastique de faire des affaires
et la plupart les utilisateurs d'Auto-By-Tel a qui nous avons parl&eacute; nous
ont dit avoir &eacute;t&eacute; s&eacute;duits par ce nouveau syst&egrave;me.&#187;</P>

<P>Pas besoin d'etre un internaute pour utiliser Auto-By-Tel. &#171; Il est facile
de naviguer sur le site d'Auto-By-Tel car il n'y a que des ic&ocirc;nes &agrave; 
cliquer, explique Sheryl Johnson. Mes parents changeront de voiture dans
peu de temps et je vais leur sugg&eacute;rer d'utiliser Auto-By-Tel. Et ils ne
sont pas du tout des experts en ordinateurs. &#187;</P>

<P> Nous avons d&eacute;couvert que le consommateur moderne a acc&egrave;s &agrave;  une foule
incroyable d'information, explique le pr&eacute;sident et co-fondateur
d'Auto-By-Tel, Peter Ellis. Il ne d&eacute;sire pas s'&eacute;puiser dans des
n&eacute;gociations; il ne veut qu'acheter une voiture &agrave; un prix abordable. 
Ellis attribue une part importante du succ&eacute;s d'Auto-By-Tel &agrave; l'entra&icirc;nement
qui enseigne aux vendeurs &agrave; se r&eacute;&eacute;valuer afin de mieux servir les nouveaux
consommateurs de l'&egrave;re &eacute;lectronique.</P>

<P>Selon les statistiques, le Canada est d&eacute;j&agrave;  conquis par l'Internet. Comme
l'explique Trevor Boquist, le directeur des ventes chez Applewood Chevrolet
Oldsmobile; un concessionnaire affili&eacute; &agrave; Auto-By-Tel : &#171; Les Canadiens ont
adopt&eacute; l'Internet comme nouveau mode de communication. Les gens font d&eacute;j&agrave; 
leur &eacute;picerie en utilisant leur ordinateur. Auto-By-Tel permet maintenant
d'employer un ordinateur pour commander une voiture neuve. Je crois que
l'Internet deviendra pour nous un nouveau style de vie. Ce n'est qu'une
mani&egrave;re innovatrice, et plus ais&eacute;e, d'&ecirc;tre en affaire. C'est direct et sans
tracas. Il y aura toutefois toujours un contact humain en ce qui concerne
le service apr&egrave;s vente et la livraison du v&eacute;hicule. Tout le monde est
gagnant.&#187; </P>

<P>Pour acheter votre prochaine voiture sur l'Internet il suffit de r&eacute;gler le
moteur de recherche &agrave; l'adresse http://www.autobytel.com ou de contacter
Auto-By-Tel par l'interm&eacute;diaire de n'importe quel service de courrier
&eacute;lectronique majeur, comme CompuServe, Prodigy et America Online.</P>

<CENTER><B>Auto-By-Tel disponible au Canada !</B><BR>

<I>Ce programme bas&eacute; sur l'Internet, et qui a r&eacute;volutionn&eacute; l'achat de v&eacute;hicules, est maintenant offert aux consommateurs et aux 
concessionnaires canadiens.</I></CENTER>

<P><B>Corona del Mar, Californie,</B> le 22 mai 1996 - Le programme qui a r&eacute;volutionn&eacute; le processus d'acquisition de v&eacute;hicules automobiles aux &Eacute;tats-Unis est d&eacute;sormais  offert au Canada. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; Internet, Auto-By-Tel achemine les demandes des acheteurs potentiels &agrave; l'un de ses 1 400 concessionnaires am&eacute;ricains qui offrent des prix bas et concurrentiels pour des voitures et camions neufs. En affaire depuis mars 1995, Auto-By-Tel a compl&egrave;tement transform&eacute; le processus d'achat de v&eacute;hicules neufs.</P>
	
<P>De nombreux concessionnaires canadiens se sont d&eacute;j&agrave; affili&eacute;s au programme d'Auto-By-Tel, et les consommateurs canadiens qui ont d&eacute;j&agrave; utilis&eacute; le programme d'Auto-By-Tel sont pleinement satisfaits. Sheryl Johnson, un r&eacute;sidente de Toronto, d&eacute;clare avec enthousiasme : &#171; J'ai &eacute;t&eacute; tr&egrave;s impressionn&eacute;e. Le concessionnaire Auto-By-Tel n'a pas tent&eacute; de me convaincre d'acheter un v&eacute;hicule plus cher que celui que j'avais choisi. Non seulement j'ai obtenu toutes les options que je d&eacute;sirais avoir et au prix que je voulais payer, mais j'ai obtenu plus; un toit ouvrant et la transmission automatique. Jamais il n'y a eu de pression et tout s'est fait par t&eacute;l&eacute;phone. Mes parents d&eacute;sirent acheter une nouvelle voiture; je suis convaincue qu'ils utiliseront le programme Auto-By-Tel ! &#187;</P>
	
<P>Les consommateurs am&eacute;ricains ont clairement d&eacute;montr&eacute; un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t dans Auto-By-Tel en soumettant plus de 100 000 demandes d'achat ou de location lors de la premi&egrave;re ann&eacute;e d'op&eacute;rations d'Auto-By-Tel. Non seulement les utilisateurs am&eacute;ricains sont pleinement satisfaits de cette nouvelle m&eacute;thode d'achat de voitures et de camions neufs &agrave; des prix comp&eacute;titifs, mais les concessionnaires b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient aussi des avantages que leur offre un programme utilisant une technologie r&eacute;volutionnaire.</P>
	
<P>Pour cr&eacute;er le programme Auto-By-Tel, Peter Ellis a profit&eacute; des grandes tendances de la r&eacute;volution technologique moderne afin de m&eacute;tamorphoser l'industrie de la vente de v&eacute;hicules automobiles. Selon Ellis, &#171; les succ&egrave;s d'Auto-By-Tel d&eacute;montrent que les consommateurs am&eacute;ricains en ont assez de la vente traditionnelle de voitures. Nous avons d&eacute;couvert que l'acheteur moderne a acc&egrave;s &agrave; une foule d'informations, tels que les prix &agrave; la livraison et les remises, et qu'il est difficile &agrave; berner. Tout ce qu'il d&eacute;sire, c'est acheter un v&eacute;hicule &agrave; un prix abordable. Cela fait plus de 75 ans que les concessionnaires vendent des voitures de la m&ecirc;me fa&ccedil;on, et Auto-By-Tel d&eacute;sire les entraner &agrave; jouer un nouveau r&ocirc;le qui satisfera le consommateur du si&egrave;cle prochain. Nous avons pris beaucoup d'expansion au cours de notre premi&egrave;re ann&eacute;e d'op&eacute;ration aux &eacute;tats-Unis, de continuer Ellis. La demande a &eacute;t&eacute; plus forte que pr&eacute;vue. Cette exp&eacute;rience acquise nous permet de mieux faire face aux demandes des consommateurs canadiens conscient de leur pouvoir d'achat. &#187;</P>
	
<P>Un r&eacute;cent rapport de l'industrie automobile* explique les succ&egrave;s d'Auto-By-Tel par son volume de vente &eacute;lev&eacute; et par ses bas co&ucirc;ts d'op&eacute;ration et de promotions. Le rapport indique &eacute;galement que : &#171; au cours des prochaines ann&eacute;es, la technologie jouera un r&ocirc;le primordial dans le s&eacute;lection des concessionnaires qui r&eacute;ussiront et ceux qui ne survivront pas &#187; et sugg&egrave;re &eacute;galement que &#171; les concessionnaires franchis&eacute;s qui d&eacute;sirent survivre s'annonceront sur Internet et adopteront une structure d'affaire bas&eacute;e sur des co&ucirc;ts d'op&eacute;ration limit&eacute;s afin d'offrir des prix comp&eacute;titifs, tel que le permet d&eacute;j&agrave; Auto-By-Tel. &#187;
	</P>
<P>Le programme d'Auto-By-Tel est simple &agrave; utiliser. Les consommateurs sont d'abord invit&eacute;s &agrave; bien se renseigner sur le v&eacute;hicule de leur choix au moyen d'Internet et ses nombreuses sources d'information, et par les magazines automobiles. Les consommateurs soumettent ensuite une demande d'achat ou de location &agrave; Auto-By-Tel (en les contactant par courrier &eacute;lectronique &agrave; l'adresse www.autobytel.com sur Internet). Cette demande est finalement achemin&eacute;e &agrave; un concessionnaire affili&eacute; &agrave; Auto-By-Tel qui, dans un d&eacute;lais de 48 heures, transmet au consommateur un prix bas et comp&eacute;titif pour son v&eacute;hicule. Ce programme est gratuit pour les consommateurs et peut leur permettre d'&eacute;conomiser des milliers de dollars.</P>
	
<P>Plus de 200 magazines, journaux et r&eacute;seaux de t&eacute;l&eacute;vision d'importance, incluant le NBC Nightly News, CNN, Fortune Magazine, Business Week Magazine, U.S. News & World Report, Time Magazine et le New York Time se sont int&eacute;ress&eacute;s &agrave; Auto-By-Tel.</P>
	
<P>Toute personne poss&eacute;dant un ordinateur et un modem peut contacter Auto-By-Tel. Il suffit de r&eacute;gler le moteur de recherche Internet &agrave; l'adresse http://www.autobytel.com ou de contacter Auto-By-Tel par l'interm&eacute;diaire de n'importe quel service de courrier &eacute;lectronique majeur, tels Prodigy, CompuServe et America Online. Auto-By-Tel Canada accepte pr&eacute;sentement les demandes d'affiliation de concessionnaires de haut calibre, mettant l'accent sur la qualit&eacute; du service &agrave; la client&egrave;le et qui d&eacute;sire faire partie du r&eacute;seau de concessionnaires Auto-By-Tel.</P>

<P><B>Les femmes d&eacute;nichent les voitures de leur r&ecirc;ve sur l'Internet et laissent derri&egrave;re elles les cauchemars des achats d'autrefois.</B></P>

<P><B>Corona del Mar, Californie,</B> le 24 avril 1996 - Debbie Knorr ne savait pas &agrave; quoi s'attendre quand elle a soumis sa demande d'achat de voiture neuve &agrave; Auto-By-Tel, un programme automobile bas&eacute; sur l'Internet. Elle fut heureuse de constater non seulement elle r&eacute;alisait une excellente affaire pour sa nouvelle Dodge Stratus mais qu'en plus elle &eacute;conomisait beaucoup de temps et d'efforts en utilisant le programme sans ennui, sans n&eacute;gociation d'Auto-By-Tel.</P>

<P>&#171; Auto-By-Tel est la voie du futur, d&eacute;clare Debbie. Nous, les &#171; baby boomers &#187; de trente ans sommes intelligents et bien renseign&eacute;s. Nous ne d&eacute;sirons pas perdre notre temps &agrave; n&eacute;gocier avec un vendeur sans scrupule. Et, avec nos carri&egrave;res &agrave; temps plein et nos familles, nous n'avons pas le temps de faire le tour des concessionnaires. &#187;</P>

<P>N'importe qui peut &ecirc;tre intimid&eacute; &agrave; l'id&eacute;e d'acheter une nouvelle voiture. Il s'agit d'une des d&eacute;penses les plus importantes que l'on peut faire, et l'achat bien ordinaire d'une automobile, qui nous oblige &agrave; perdre des journ&eacute;es enti&egrave;res dans les salles de montre des concessionnaires, nous prive de beaucoup de temps libre. C'est pourquoi Debbie et son &eacute;poux se sont tourn&eacute;s vers l'Internet pour bien se renseigner sur la Dodge Stratus et puis vers Auto-By-Tel (&agrave; l'adresse www. autobytel.com) pour acheter la voiture par l'interm&eacute;diaire d'un des concessionnaires associ&eacute;s.</P>

<P>&#171; Apr&egrave;s avoir &eacute;tabli ce que serait la meilleure affaire &agrave; r&eacute;aliser, nous avons d&eacute;cid&eacute; d'essayer Auto-By-Tel, explique Debbie. Non seulement le concessionnaire Auto-By-Tel nous a fait une offre inf&eacute;rieure de 1 000$ en comparaison avec le meilleur prix que nous avions trouv&eacute; auparavant mais il a aussi d&eacute;nich&eacute; la voiture que je d&eacute;sirais, de la bonne couleur, pour un montant 300$ sous du prix factur&eacute; au concessionnaire ! &#187;</P>

<P>Les consommateurs sont invit&eacute;s &agrave; bien se documenter sur les v&eacute;hicules de leur choix (Auto-By-Tel poss&egrave;de des chanons permettant de consulter les sites automobiles les plus populaires de l'Internet) puis de soumettre leur demande d'achat &agrave; Auto-By-Tel. Cette demande est achemin&eacute;e &agrave; l'un des 1 400 concessionnaires qui aident les consommateurs. Le concessionnaire contacte le client dans les 48 heures qui suivent la demande et lui communique un prix extr&ecirc;mement comp&eacute;titif. Il n'y a ni n&eacute;gociation, ni surprise. Le programme est gratuit pour les consommateurs et peut non seulement leur faire &eacute;conomiser des milliers de dollars mais &eacute;galement &eacute;liminer les pertes de temps et d'&eacute;nergies reli&eacute;es aux n&eacute;gociations traditionnelles.</P>

<P>Auto-By-Tel a r&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; plus de 100 000 demandes d'achat &agrave; son r&eacute;seau de concessionnaires l'an dernier, et la moyenne d'achat est presque de 70 %. Donald Keithley, de la firme J.D. Power et Associ&eacute;s, d&eacute;clare que le succ&egrave;s d'Auto-By-Tel est d&ucirc; &agrave; un facteur d&eacute;terminant : &#171;Auto-By-Tel rend l'achat d'un v&eacute;hicule neuf facile pour le consommateur. Il s'agit d'une consid&eacute;ration d&eacute;terminante pour les familles &agrave; double revenus qui font face &agrave; de contraintes de temps terriblement s&eacute;v&egrave;res. &#187;</P>

<P>Peter Ellis, le co-fondateur d'Auto-By-Tel, dit simplement que : &#171;Auto-By-Tel &eacute;limine tous les d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ments li&eacute;s &agrave; l'achat d'une voiture neuve. Nous aidons les concessionnaires &agrave; trouver les acheteurs s&eacute;rieux et &agrave; offrir aux clients les meilleurs prix possibles. Tout le monde est gagnant. &#187;</P>

<P>Toute personne poss&eacute;dant un ordinateur et un modem peut contacter Auto-By-Tel. Il suffit de r&eacute;gler le moteur de recherche Internet &agrave; l'adresse http://www.autobytel.com ou de contacter Auto-By-Tel par l'interm&eacute;diaire de n'importe quel service de courrier &eacute;lectronique majeur, tels Prodigy, CompuServe, America Online et Microsoft Network.   </P>

<B>Les consommateurs sont combl&eacute;s par des nouvelles m&eacute;thodes d'achat bas&eacute;s sur la haute technologie.</B>

<P><B>Corona del Mar, Californie,</B> le 15 avril 1996 - Les conclusions sont &eacute;difiantes : les consommateurs sont pr&ecirc;ts et dispos&eacute;s &agrave; utiliser de nouvelles m&eacute;thodes pour acheter des voitures. Exasp&eacute;r&eacute;s par les tactiques traditionnelles des concessionnaires, les acheteurs de voitures neuves recherchent activement de nouveaux moyens allant du super march&eacute; de voitures d'occasion au programme innovateur d'Auto-By-Tel bas&eacute; sur l'Internet.</P>

<P>Fait int&eacute;ressant, Auto-By-Tel r&eacute;colte la plus grande part de ces achats alternatifs. &#171; La croissance &eacute;tonnante d'Auto-By-Tel m'a stup&eacute;faite, d&eacute;clare Peter Ellis, le co-fondateur et pr&eacute;sident d'Auto-By-Tel. Cela prouve que l'Internet est l'outil de marketing le plus viable dans notre monde d'information. &#187;</P>

<P>Un aper&ccedil;u du fonctionnement d'Auto-By-Tel illustre bien pourquoi ce concept a balay&eacute; les id&eacute;es traditionnelles du monde de l'industrie automobile. Non seulement le consommateur peut effectuer une demande d'achat dans tout le confort et l'intimit&eacute; de sa propre maison mais, comme le d&eacute;crit Dan Chiaverini, un utilisateur d'Auto-By-Tel : &#171; le prix que l'on m'a communiqu&eacute; &eacute;tait un tel rabais en comparaison du prix qu'avais obtenu auparavant Je n'arrivais tout simplement pas &agrave; le croire. &#187;
</P>
<P>Donald Keithley, de la firme J.D. Power et Associ&eacute;s, d&eacute;clare que le succ&egrave;s d'Auto-By-Tel est d&ucirc; &agrave; un facteur d&eacute;terminant : &#171;Auto-By-Tel rend l'achat d'un v&eacute;hicule neuf facile pour le consommateur. En offrant un contact direct avec l'Internet, Auto-By-Tel a r&eacute;solu efficacement et rapidement les besoins des consommateurs. Il s'agit d'une consid&eacute;ration d&eacute;terminante pour les familles &agrave; double revenus qui doivent faire face &agrave; des contraintes de temps terriblement s&eacute;v&egrave;res. &#187;</P>

<P>Auto-By-Tel aide les consommateurs Canadiens et Am&eacute;ricains &agrave; acheter leur voitures ou camions neufs par l'interm&eacute;diaire d'un vaste r&eacute;seau de concessionnaires affili&eacute;s qui d&eacute;sirent offrir un service efficace et des prix d&eacute;fiant toute comp&eacute;tition. Avant qu'un consommateur ne soumette sa demande d'achat, il est invit&eacute; &agrave; bien se renseigner sur le v&eacute;hicule de son choix en utilisant d'autres sites d'Internet tels le Edmund's Automobile Buyer's Guides et le Microsoft CarSource. Sa demande est achemin&eacute;e &agrave; l'un des 1 400 concessionnaires affili&eacute;s qui la traite. Le concessionnaire contacte le consommateur dans les 48 heures qui suivent avec un prix. Le programme est absolument gratuit pour les consommateurs et peut faire &eacute;conomiser des milliers de dollars.</P>

<P>Toute personne poss&eacute;dant un ordinateur et un modem peut contacter Auto-By-Tel. Il suffit de r&eacute;gler le moteur de recherche Internet &agrave; l'adresse http://www.autobytel.com ou de contacter Auto-By-Tel par l'interm&eacute;diaire de n'importe quel service de courrier &eacute;lectronique majeur, tels Prodigy, CompuServe, America Online et Microsoft Network.</P>

Vous cherchez une voiture neuve ? Vous trouverez la meilleure affaire sur Internet. Pas d'attrape avec Auto-By-Tel.</B>

<P><B>St. Louis, Missouri</B>, le 12 mars 1996 - Cameron et Kathleen Cook de Columbia, en Illinois ont &eacute;t&eacute; tellement satisfaits du prix que leur a obtenu Auto-By-Tel qu'une semaine apr&egrave;s avoir pris livraison de leur voiture chez Huey's Honda de St. Louis County, Missouri ils ont convaincu leur neveu d'utiliser aussi ce service. Auto-By-Tel est le plus important programme d'achat de v&eacute;hicules  situ&eacute; sur Internet. Cameron Cook, un ing&eacute;nieur de locomotives &agrave; l'emploi de la Union Pacific Railroad, d&eacute;clare : &#171; Nous avons eu des Honda depuis 1981 et avons g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement toujours pay&eacute; le plein prix. Nous avons &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tonn&eacute; lorsque nous avons visit&eacute; la page d'accueil d'Auto-By-Tel sur Internet (www.autobytel.com) et constat&eacute; qu'on pouvait acheter des v&eacute;hicules &agrave; prix comp&eacute;titifs sans que cela nous co&ucirc;te un sous. &#187; Monsieur Cook a vite d&eacute;couvert que tout cela &eacute;tait bien vrai.</P>

<P>Afin d'effectuer le bon choix parmi la vaste gamme de voitures Honda, les Cook ont visit&eacute;s les nombreux concessionnaires de leur voisinage afin d'obtenir les prix de vente, les couleurs et options disponibles. Monsieur Cook a ensuite visit&eacute; le site &#171; Edmund's Automobile Buyers Guide &#187; sur l'Internet qui lui a permis d'obtenir gratuitement des listes de concessionnaires, les factures au d&eacute;tail, et des essais routiers de nouveaux v&eacute;hicules.</P>

<P>Le fonctionnement d'Auto-By-Tel est simple. Les Cook ont d'abord compl&eacute;t&eacute; la demande d'achat d'Auto-By-Tel sur le site Internet et, apr&egrave;s un jour d'attente, ils ont re&ccedil;u un appel t&eacute;l&eacute;phonique de Huey's Honda. &#171; Ils nous ont dit qu'ils avaient notre voiture et nous ont communiqu&eacute; le prix d'Auto-By-Tel, d&eacute;clare Cameron Cook. Puisque j'avais d&eacute;j&agrave; v&eacute;rifi&eacute; les prix factur&eacute;s aux concessionnaires gr&acirc;ce &agrave; Edmund's, je savais qu'il s'agissait bel et bien du prix factur&eacute; au concessionnaire ! J'&eacute;tais estomaqu&eacute; et je m'attendais une attrape quelconque. &#187;</P>

<P>Il n'y a jamais eu d'attrape. En prenant livraison de leur voiture chez Hueys' Honda, les Cook &eacute;taient convaincu qu'ils allaient confronter un vendeur d&eacute;sirant leur offrir des suppl&eacute;ments et des extra. Ce ne fut pas le cas. &#171; J'ai achet&eacute; 12 nouvelles voitures au cours des 27 derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es et c'est la premi&egrave;re fois que je consid&egrave;re avoir fait une bonne affaire, sans marchandage. &#187;</P>

<P>Le programme d'Auto-By-Tel conna&icirc;t un &eacute;norme succ&egrave;s &agrave; cause des standards &eacute;lev&eacute;s des concessionnaires participants. Par exemple, Huey's Honda est dirig&eacute; par Andy Huey, le vice-pr&eacute;sident du Greater St. Louis Automotive Association. Parmi les autres concessionnaires du Missouri on note Lou Fusz Auto Group (de St. Louis), Shawnee Mission Ford (de Kansas City), Car City (de St. Joseph) et Markus Allen Toyota (de Kansas City).</P>

<P>Toute personne qui poss&egrave;de un ordinateur ainsi qu'un modem peut contacter Auto-By-Tel. Vous n'avez qu'&agrave; indiquer &agrave; votre moteur de recherche de trouver l'adresse http://www.autobytel.com, ou de chercher Auto-By-Tel sur CompuServe, Prodigy, America Online ou Microsoft Network.</P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death in the United States of America, and it is estimated that over 750,000 people suffer from this condition in Australia. Diabetes is a general term that describes two different forms and severities of this disease.<p>

Diabetes mellitus occurs secondarily to an inadequate production of insulin by the pancreas, or from an ineffective utilisation of the insulin in the body. Insulin is a hormone which regulates the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood stream.<p>

Glucose is a critical source of energy used by every organ in the body and is the ONLY energy source used by the brain. When carbohydrate is consumed, it is absorbed into the body and converted to glucose. Without insulin, the glucose level in the bloodstream rises unchecked, and the body is unable to effectively use it for the regulation of metabolism.<p>

Insulin is the necessary link that enables the body to transport glucose into the cells for energy metabolism. At this time, Diabetes has no cure, so treatment is lifelong.

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="product/astfill2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="122" BORDER="0" HSPACE="5">People with asthma have airways which are more sensitive than normal - the condition itself occurs when these airways are exposed to certain trigger factors/allergens which causes the tissue/lining of the lung to become inflamed and to narrow. The narrowing of the airways is caused by the tightening of the smooth muscle (smooth muscle is involuntary tissue, which cannot be consciously controlled) in the walls of the airways and a simultaneous swelling and inflammation in the lining of the wall.<p>

In some cases, this leads to increased mucous production and a restriction in air flow to the lungs. This causes the traditional symptoms of asthma which we recognise as wheezing, coughing, tightness in the chest or shortness of breath. Asthma is a reversible condition   which can change in severity over short periods of time.<p>

Australia has one of the highest per capita rates of asthma in the world, recent studies have shown that  1 in 5 children have a recent history of asthma. According to the National Asthma Campaign (NAC) , asthma affects approximately 1.4 million Australians across all age groups. Approximately 2.5 million people in Australia have allergy problems.

Asthma is associated with both environmental and genetic factors. It tends to run in families and some people who get asthma are also prone to allergic conditions such as eczema and hay fever. Because the airways are more sensitive in people with asthma, when they are exposed to a trigger factor the lungs tend to overreact becoming inflamed and narrow. A lot of research has recently gone into this area and some scientists believe that certain allergens, such as dustmite which we are exposed to in early childhood may play a role in the development of asthma.

The heart is a four chambered, double pump. It's pump action creates the pressure head needed to push blood in vessels to the lungs and body cells.<p>

At rest, the heart of an adult pumps about 5.0 L/min of blood and it takes about one minute for blood to be circulated to the most distal extremity of the body and back to the heart. In the United States, Heart Diseases account for around 34% of all deaths followed closely by Cancer at 23%. Disease to due CVA (cerebrovascular accident or stroke) account for about 7%. Cardiac disease and mortality remains, for some people as a condition that can be avoided through care and attention to lifestyle and diet.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/sunburn.jpg" ALT="Sun Burn at the Beach" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="270" HEIGHT="139" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Most of us enjoy spending time in the sun. In Australia, it is a national way of life and a legacy of our beautiful climate. Unfortunately, it is only in recent years we have become aware of the price we pay to worship the sun.<p>

It is a fact that we develop prematurely aged skin much earlier than people living in cooler, or less sunny climates. In addition we have the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world. In fact, 2 our of 3 Australians will develop at least one skin cancer during their life and 1000 will die from skin cancer every year. Fortunately most skin cancers can be prevented by protecting our skin from the sun's rays.<p>

To do this, it is essential that we use a sunscreen that gives us as much protection as possible. For most people, an SPF 15+ sunscreen is considered the best protection available. But not all SPF 15+ sunscreens, especially some brands obtained in supermarkets protect your skin from all the harmful rays of the sun.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/sunsensefacemilk.jpg" ALT="Sunsense Products" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="179" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">SPF stands for Sun Protection Factor, and it measures protection of human skin from a mixture of UV-A and UV-B. If a product has an SPF of 15+. it will give approximately 16 times your natural protection - if your skin takes only 5 minutes before it begins to redden, then with a sunscreen of SPF 15+ it will redden in 80 minutes. The actual length of action by a sunscreen is determined solely upon the skin type (ie; fair, olive skinned, dark skinned).<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Aromatherapy is the treatment of illness with aromatic plant essential oils. Essential oils contain vitamins, hormones, antibiotics, pheromones (invisible but eloquent scentual signals) and cell regenerating agents that nourish, energise and protect the living plant. These properties strengthen the plant's immunity to disease by killing bacteria and neutralising viruses. By extracting these valuable essential oils from plants we too can harness their healing qualities and apply them to our own human bodies.<p>

Essential oils work in two ways; physically through the penetration of human tissue into the bloodstream when applied with direct application, in a massage oil blend to the body, a facial oil, in a therapeutic bath, footbath or facial steam inhalation; and psychologically via the effect of one's sense of smell on the nervous system, introduced by way of a vapourisation, or steam or direct inhalation.<p>

Aromatherapy offers the opportunity to treat illness using drug free and natural therapy, that when used in combination with herbal and conventional medicine may assist in relieving conditions that previously, have been frustratingly stubborn. Certainly, Aromatherapy is no wonder cure, but conventional medicine rarely provides us with quick fix treatments either, so consider this type of treatment as a useful adjunct to your current conventional, herbal, homeopathic health treatment.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If you have arthritis, you already know about pain. you know how it can slow you down in everyday life, and may lead to lost working days, or loss of enjoyment in many of the simple tasks and events in life. There are over 100 different types of arthritis. The three most common forms are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout. In Australia alone, over 2 million people suffer some form these debilitating conditions. Their symptoms  may range from a painful twinge or stiffness in one or two joints, to the unbearable agony that makes any small task a painful battle of endurance.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Acne is one of the most common diseases in dermatology. Pimples, blackheads or acne occur mainly during adolescence and are due to hormonal changes which cause an increase in sebum production. Blocking of the sebaceous or oil duct may occur and cause a small rupture beneath the surface of the skin. The sebum then sets up an inflammatory response which is aggravated by bacteria on the skin.<p>

Treatment should unblock the oil ducts and help to decrease the amount of oil being secreted, as well as offering an anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial action. A gentle antibacterial wash should be used which has a slight acid pH to match that of the skin. Then a preparation should be applied which is formulated to perform the above actions.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/acnederm.jpg" ALT="Acne Derm Wash" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="160" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">Any dandruff present should also be treated. Acnederm Wash is an anti-bacterial wash with three antiseptics and a pH of 5.5. It has a broad spectrum of anti-microbial activity which aids in the resolution of any infections that exist with acne. Contains Glycerol to leave the skin feeling soft and smooth, not taut and dry like many other acne wash preparations.<p>

Acnederm Ointment contains alcloxa 2% to dry excess oil secretions, sulphur 2.5% for its keratolytic effect in a soothing tinted base which helps to cover pimples.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>An embarrassing problem for teenagers</b><p>

It seems most unfair that at an age when we are particularly concerned by our appearance, we tend to suffer most from the disfigurement of acne.  Although it may be true that a large percentage of people suffer similarly during their teenage years, vague promises that the problem will eventually go away does nothing to help today's sufferers.  Apart from the inflammation of the skin, acne seems to cause few physical complications, but the emotional effects of this skin disorder on teenage sufferers cannot be overlooked.<p>

<b>A Teenage Dilemma</b><p>

Up to 80% of all teenagers will experience some form of acne.  The hormonal changes of the rapidly maturing adolescent body, along with a teenage preference for 
'junk foods' high in fat and sugar, are both contributors to the problem of acne formation.  The early teen years can be extremely stressful, and this too is thought to contribute to the problem.<p>

<b>Different Types</b><p>

Of the three main types of acne, acne vulgaris, is the most common form, and the one that particularly troubles young people.  Acne rosacea and acne varioliformis are more usual in adults, but respond quite well to the same treatments that are implemented for Acne vulgaris.<p>

<b>Symptoms</b><p>

Acne usually occurs where the sebaceous glands are most numerous, the forehead, nose, chin, chest, back and sometimes the thighs.  The process of inflammation begins around a hair shaft where the sebaceous glands are situated.  These glands secrete a fatty substance called sebum and in the first stages of acne these sebaceous secretion block the pores of the skin causing comedones or blackheads.  Once these become inflamed, the familiar and embarrassing pimples are evident.  In attempts to rid themselves of these unsightly spots, some sufferers squeeze and scratch at the pimples, only to further aggravate the problem to the extent where scarring and pitting can remain long after the last pimple has disappeared.<p>

<b>Why You?</b><p>

One of our skin's main functions is to effectively eliminate waste from the body, via the pores.  It assists the kidneys, lungs and bowels in this function.  However, should one of these organs dysfunction, it places extra pressure on the others.  This explains why acne and constipation often occur together.  The skin is compensation for the bowels' inability to eliminate waste.  Although it may not be possible to avoid acne altogether by ensuring regular bowel motions, the severity of the outbreaks may be lessened.  This is also true of the other eliminative glands in association with acne.  So, this skin problem can be seen as an indication that an imbalance is occurring in the body.<p>

<b>Is Acne Hereditary?</b><p>

Before this question can be answered satisfactorily, the diet must be examined.  Often it is our eating habits that are more hereditary than the acne.  This skin problem may be passed down from mother to daughter or from father to son because the same dietary mistakes are being made over and over again.  An imbalance in our diet can once again cause an imbalance in the way our bodies eliminate waste.<p>

<b>Protect Your Body and Correct The Imbalance</b><p>

<b>Protection</b><p>

<B>Vitamin A</B>  is commonly used in the treatment of acne because it helps to maintain healthy mucous membranes, the natural barriers to disease, and can therefore make your skin more resistant to infection.<p>

<B>Vitamin C</B> is essential for the formation of collagen which holds the tissues together.  It also helps to reduce inflammation by stimulating the body's immune system.<p>

<B>Zinc</B> aids in the healing of skin disorders.<p>

<b>Balance</b><p>

<B>Echinacea</B> is a herb that is well known as a valuable blood purifier, as well as an immune stimulant.<p>

<B>Dong Quai</B>,  a Chinese herb, is of particular relevance to teenage girls to balance their hormones, which may cause acne outbreaks.<p>

<B>Evening Primrose Oil</B>, like Dong Quai, may also help to balance teenage hormones.<p>

The Herb's, <B>Burdock, Sassafras</B> and <B>dandelion</B> are recommended as blood purifiers.  They are often available in combination in tablet form.<p>


<B>Chlorella</B>, <B>wheatgrass</B> and <B>barley</B> are highly concentrated foods rich in trace elements and chlorophyll.  They are also available in combination as a "green" powder which can be mixed in water or fruit juice.  World famous nutritionist Dr Bernard Jensen is often quoted from his research into chlorophyll:  "When you're green inside, you're clean inside."  Its tonic effect on the blood stream is most beneficial for the internal treatment of acne and other skin problems.<p>

By attacking the embarrassing problem of acne from within, not only can you treat it, but you can also prevent further outbreaks.  Acne formulas are available from Gosnells Amcal Chemist, which contain many of the above nutrients in one dose.<p>

Australians and international customers now have access to a revolutionary drug-free adhesive strip which, when applied to the outside of the nose gently opens the nasal passages - reducing airflow resistance by 31% and making breathing easier. This exciting new device can reduce snoring, relieve nasal congestion and may even improve sports performance - just look at some of our Olympic athletes and elite sportsmen.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/nasalstrip.jpg" ALT="Breathe Right Nasal Strips" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="75" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#6072FF">Breathe Right Nasal Strips, a simple yet ingenious device from 3M Pharmaceuticals, will enable you to breathe well, breathe easy, and above all, Breathe Right.</FONT><p>

Breathe Right nasal strips are a completely mechanical, and therefore drug-free, means of opening nasal passages and reducing airflow resistance. Each strip is lined with two plastic strips which form a backbone. When properly placed between the bridge and end of the nose, the strip gently lifts the soft areas of skin above the flare of each nostril. As the plastic strip straightens it carefully opens nasal passages, making breathing easier.<p>

<H3>Diabetes Type I</H3>
This refers to the form of diabetes that has its onset in childhood or adolescence. It may be inherited (genetic), research continues to discover a link between this disease and genetics. Type I patients are termed 'insulin dependent' and rely upon insulin injections to maintain normal body functions. Without adequate insulin, they can be subjected to diabetic ketoacidosis.<p>

<B>Symptoms</B> include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. Rapid weight loss, increased weakness and fatigue are often signs of a Type I diabetic.
</BLOCKQUOTE><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Diabetes Type II</H3>
Diabetes Type II (2) most commonly occurs in middle aged, overweight people whose blood sugar is higher than normal. This type of diabetes is not so much a lack of insulin, but an inability by the body to allow glucose into the cells. It is often referred to as mature onset diabetes. In most cases, this type of diabetes is adequately controlled by a carefully controlled diet, and weight reduction. While, insulin treatment is generally not necessary, Type 2 sufferers may contract the same long term complications as Type 1 patients.<p>

<B>Symptoms</B> include increased hunger, increased thirst, increased urination, blurred eyesight, increased fatigue, numbness or tingling in the hands or feet, frequent skin infections, slow healing of wounds and impotence.<p>

The World Health Organisation outlines the Diagnosis of Diabetes as when the above symptoms are observed together with a measured blood glucose level of over 12 mmol/L (millimole per litre). This data should be coupled with a fasting blood glucose level of greater than 7.8 mmol/L.<p>

Research has shown that diabetes can affect some of the tissues in the body, particularly if the condition has been poorly controlled and blood glucose levels have been elevated over long periods of time.<p>

<b>Continual high levels of glucose in the blood are thought to cause;</b>
<OL>
	<LI>Aging of the fibres in joints.
	<LI>Damage to small blood vessels.
	<LI>High Cholesterol and Triglyceride Levels.
	<LI>Atherosclerosis
	<LI>Damage to nerve fibres.
	<LI>Clouding of the lens (cataracts)
	<LI>Damage to the retina (retinopathy) - "light nerves".
	<LI>Swelling of the macula (a tissue responsible for sharp, central vision).
	<LI>Nerve damage resulting in loss of the pain sensation, callouses, sweating may be diminished resulting in dry, cracked skin.
	<LI>Impotence which could be  due to a blockage or reduction of blood flow to the penis.
	<LI>Nephropathy (Kidney failure). Diabetes can affect the small blood vessels in the kidney which are responsible for filtering the blood. As the filtering system becomes more and more inefficient  - protein begins to leak into the urine. This may be one of the first indications of  nephrophathy.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Diabetes is not all "doom and gloom", most sufferers can lead a relatively normal life through careful control of diet, stress, exercise, regular monitoring of their blood glucose levels coupled with a health programme approved by your doctor.<p>

Remember, Control your diet - know what to eat, and when to eat.
Exercise regularly - this improves the sensitivity of the bodies cells to insulin and assists in weight control.
Monitor your blood glucose levels.<p>

Blood glucose monitoring provides your doctor with the most valuable information with regard to your condition - remember, your condition is characterised by elevated blood glucose levels, so monitoring of these levels gives a direct indication of how well the disease is being managed.<p>

<b>"How do I monitor my blood glucose levels ?"</b><p>

Use of a reputable blood glucose monitor/meter is simple. Most meters require only a small drop of blood, and depending upon your doctor, it may be necesary to test up to twice daily readings to as little as only once or twice a week. Regular monitoring will allow your doctor to make an objective comment about your management program, and will give you a greater understanding of your blood glucose patterns in regard and the effects of diet, exercise and medication.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is thought that prolonged high blood glucose levels can lead to damaged nerves, in particular those that supply the feet, this can result in loss of the pain sensation; the shape of the foot and the way you walk may change; callouses and corns may form; sweating may be diminshed leading to dry cracked skin. Sometimes, the blood supply is interrupted in diabetes and this can lead to delayed healing of  even small wounds and sores.<p>

Foot injury can result from many causes including heat (sunburn, hot water bottles etc), cold/frostbite, pressure sores, chemicals and strong patent medicines like iodine or corn pads, and adhesive tapes. Many of these injuries may be painless - Inspect your feet every day.<p>

Keep an eye out for fungal infections such as tinea pedis (athletes foot), callouses, ingrown toe nails, pressure sores from tight shoes and gangrene. To avoid dry, cracked heels and feet - try massaging a suitable moisturising cream into the area. Suitable products are Urederm, which is a urea cream or Eulactol Heel Balm for more severe conditions.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Asthma medications are usually taken by inhalation, this of course enables the medication to go straight to the lungs. This means that it can more quickly allow smaller doses of medication to be given and keeps unwanted side effects to a minimum.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/astspacer.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="109" BORDER="0" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="5"><H3>Spacer Devices</H3>
Spacers can be attached to most metered dose inhalers (or 'puffers) to make them easier to use. They allow you to inhale medication without having to worry about your breathing technique. Spacers trap larger particles of medication which may otherwise only reach your mouth and allow smaller particles to be deposited in the airways. This increases the effect of your medication and reduces unwanted side effects. <p>

<H3>Nebuliser Therapy Systems</H3>
Nebuliser therapy is generally recommended as an aid in the management of asthma in conjunction with medical supervision. Nebulisers can also be of use in controlling sudden and severe asthma attacks. They are particularly useful for patients who have difficulty using MDI's ('puffers') such as young children and the elderly. They work by producing a steady supply of aerosol medication which can be taken over several minutes while breathing normally using a face mask or mouthpiece. There are a variety of nebuliser pump systems available including standard models, portable travel units and ultrasonic nebulisers.<p>

Regular maintenance of your nebuliser is essential.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Allergens</H3>
Allergens are a frequent trigger of asthma. They can cause a variety of allergic reactions ranging from hay fever to skin rash and of course the cough and wheeze associated with asthma. Some common trigger factors include.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/astmites.jpg" ALT="Dust Mites" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="142" BORDER="0" HSPACE="5"><H3>House Dust Mite</H3>
Recent medical research suggests that for 70-80% of people with asthma, the allergens associated with the common house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and D.farinaes) may be trigger factors. Dust mites are microscopic creatures, invisible to the naked eye - they live in their millions in mattresses and bedding, feeding on a diet of skin scales which we and our pets shed daily. To reduce exposure to dust mite:
Wash bed clothes regularly in hot water (above 55 degrees Celsius).
Cover pillows, mattresses and doonas with high quality anti-allergan covers, such as those in the Allersearch DAC (Dust Mite Allergen Control) range, which act as a protective barrier between the sufferer and the source of the problem. 
Dust regularly with a damp cloth.
Carpets are a major breeding area. Wall-to-wall carpeting and rugs should preferably be removed in favour of bare floorboards or tiling. If this is not practical, vacuum regularly and use a dedicated anti-allergen solution such as DAC Spray. Spray on carpets every 3-4 months.<p>

<H3>Grasses and Pollens</H3>
Wind Borne pollens from some grasses and trees are by far the major cause of eye and nose allergies, commonly known as hay fever. To reduce exposure;
Avoid going out on windy spring or summer days.
Keep windows and doors closed if possible.
Wear sunglasses.
Avoid mowing lawns or wear a face mask if possible.<p>

<b>NB: Preparations containing pollen (such as royal jelly) have also been implicated in severe and sometimes fatal allergic reactions in certain people with asthma.</b><p>

<H3>Moulds</H3>
Moulds are also common trigger factors. Moulds are fungi which form cotton-like growths in damp and dark places. They are often found in the home in places like bathrooms and dark cupboards. To reduce exposure;
Air your home as much a possible to reduce moisture.
Keep living areas free from food or drink spillages.
Remove any visible mould with an anti-mould solution.<p>

<H3>Household Pets (Cats & Dogs)</H3>
Hair, skin particles, saliva and feathers from some common household pets and other animals such as horses can trigger asthma. Avoid animals which you are known to be allergic to, and keep pets out of bedrooms and outside the home completely if possible.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/astsmoke.jpg" ALT="Tobacco Smoke" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="142" BORDER="0" HSPACE="5"><H3>Tobacco Smoke</H3>
Tobacco smoke may damage and irritate the airways, even 'passive' smoking can cause  'twitchy' airways for up to four hours. Don't smoke if you are prone to asthma and make your home a "smoke-free-zone".<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="product/astfill1.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="91" HEIGHT="123" BORDER="0">Asthma cannot be cured but it can be adequately controlled. There are two basic types of asthma medication - reliever and preventer medication. <p>

Reliever Medications are used to relieve symptoms when they are present. They ease symptoms by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways making them open again so that air flows more freely. Because they "open up" the airways (ie; the bronchi and bronchioles), they are sometimes referred to as bronchodilators. Examples of this type of medication includes Ventolin, Bricanyl, Berotec, Atrovent and Serevent.<p>

Preventer Medications act to prevent the airways from becoming swollen and producing too much mucous. They tend to work very slowly and to be effective, they need to be taken on a regular basis. Sometime it takes several weeks for their full potential to be realised. Examples include Intal, Becotide, Becloforte, Tilade, Aldecin and Pulmicort.<p>

For more information on your particular asthma medication, please <A HREF="mailto:enquiries@gac.com.au">E-mail</A>, Jason, Mark or Jane and we can provide detailed advice on your treatment.<p>

<H3>The Importance of Measuring Your Lung Function.</H3>
Peak flow meters help assess how well your lungs are working. Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) is the fastest speed at which air is forced from the lungs after taking in a deep breath . This measurement is useful in detecting changes in the airways that may signal an improvement or worsening of your lung function. The NAC recommends that people using asthma medication on a regular basis measure their lung function with a peak flow meter as part of an overall 'Action Plan' developed in conjunction with their doctor.<p>

This is a personalised management plan which informs you what you should do to keep your symptoms under control and what to do if your asthma worsens. Allersearch Peak Flow Meters (PFM) are the ideal way to monitor peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). The range has been developed following a thorough accuracy testing programme in major Australian hospitals.<p>

It includes a standard range (50-800L/minute) meter for older children and adults and a low range (25-300L/minute) meter for younger children, the elderly or adults with sever airway limitations. Using a PFM is one of the single most important therapies you as an asthma sufferer can engage in - it may even predict an asthma attack up to 5 days in advance, which you can then take steps to avoid.<p>

<H3>Is my Asthma Getting Worse ?</H3>
The following symptoms may indicate a worsening of Asthma;<p>

Waking during the night with a cough or wheezing.

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
While we don't intend to give you a complete lecture on the physiology of the circulatory system of the human, a quick overview may help you to understand the role of the heart in the body. The heart as mentioned is responsible for moving blood throughout the body.<p>

A general guide to the route which blood takes is as follows. Blood is pumped from the right side of the heart leaving from the right ventricle , via the pulmonary trunk to the lungs, where it returns back to the left side of the heart (into the left atrium), oxygenated and for transportation to the rest of the body. The blood departs the body from the left ventricle via the aorta where it is distributed to the rest of the body. The oxygen depleted blood returns back to the right atrium of the heart via the inferior and superior vena cava veins.<p>

The heart is surrounded by a complex web of electrical fibres that when stimulated cause the heart muscles to contract at appropriate times - these fibres are broken into two branches, (left and right). The sino-atrial node (SA node) is the pacemaker of the heart and initiates the cardiac cycle of systole (compression) and diastole (relaxation) by producing an electrical impulse that first spreads over both atria causing a simultaneous compression; this electrical impulse passes through the atrioventricular bundle (the bundle of His) which when distributed through the Purkinjie Fibres of the ventricles (electrical fibres) causes them to contract ejecting blood out of the heart. The electrical patterns emmitted by the heart can in fact be measured by your physician (ECG - Electrocardiograph) and used in the diagnosis of heart conditions.<p>

There are a myriad of problems that can arise in the life of your heart including starvation of blood (myocardial infarction); lack of oxygen due to increased  workload (angina); cardiac arrhythmia (abnormal heart beat patterns); ineffective pumping action of  the heart (cardiac failure). In general to avoid some of the afore mentioned problems you should reduce excess weight; avoid hypertension through proper diet, stress reduction, avoid smoking, and exercise regularly.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
Myocardial infarction describes the complete blockage of a coronary blood vessel, the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle - with total blockage of a blood vessel, the area to which that blood vessel leads in the heart could die or be severely damaged.<p>

Angina is a scaled down form of MI where chest discomfort is experienced due to the heart's inability to recieve an adequate supply of blood/oxygen - MI results when that blood flow is completely interrupted. Common symptoms of angina/MI include a mid-chest (sub-sternal) discomfort or pain which is often described as a crushing pain or discomfort - this pain may be referred to the arm, throat, back or jaw. Other associated symptoms include shortness of breath, sweating, and nausea. Normally, the pain is provoked by exertion.<p>

If these symptoms are experienced, and particularly if you have a history of heart disease or hypertension - your physician should be immediately contacted. Normally, MI is diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms, ECG, chest X-ray, and blood tests to monitor cardiac enzymes (produced in a typical fashion during MI), blood counts, blood chemistry and coagulation profile.<p>

Patients who may be at risk of coronary heart disease, but have as yet had no chest pain or other likely symptoms will quite often undergo an evaluation which may include a stress test (treadmill exercise test), scan of the heart, cardiac catherterisation, ECG, blood cholesterol test and a chest X-ray.<p>

Treatment of angina and MI is the sole domain of your physician - under no circumstances should natural therapy, or non-medical treatment be used - angina, can develop into myocardial infarction - this can cause death.<p>

Your physician may use a range of medicines which include glyceryl trinitrate (anginine) or isosorbide denigrate to help open the coronary blood vessels; anti-coagulant therapy; agents to help dissolve blood clots are sometimes used in hospital for acute myocardial infarction. The most commonly used treatment for angina attacks is glyceryl trinitrate tablets or spray - the tablets should be replaced every 90 days (once opened) and only be stored in a glass or metal container; plastic containers are not suitable as they may affect the potency of the tablets. If you are suffering from an angina attack, gently rest yourself, and place your treatment (Anginine, Isordil) under your tongue and allow to dissolve - these tablets while dilating your coronary blood vessels, may dilate other blood vessels in the body causing flushing, headache and dizziness. If you require a second tablet, immediately call your physician once administering the tablet.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
Cardiac failure is a major public health problem affecting approximately 1 in 50 Australians - in general it affects the older population, whose life expectancy is increasing, the incidence is also increasing and is a major cause of hospital admissions. The exact cause is often different with each patients, however, there is normally a common symptom complex which includes; breathlessness, oedema, enlarged liver, increased blood pressure, fatigue. Diagnosis is complex for this condition - however, cardiac failure amounts to an abnormal build-up of fluid in the lungs due to an ineffective pumping of the heart.<p>

Some of the causes can include leakage of the heart valves allowing "leakage" and an ineffective flow of blood through the heart. Over time, the heart will attempt to compensate for the problem by enlarging and pumping faster. Cardiomyopathy is a term that describes a weakness in the hearts ability to contract which may result from long standing hypertension, diabetes, alcohol abuse, or multiple heart attacks which can all affect the heart to the point of compromising its ability to pump blood.<p>

Myocardial infarction can cause sudden (acute) congestive heart failure where a substantial portion of the heart muscle has been severely damaged and its pumping ability is impaired.<p>

Some of the drugs used include diuretics to help remove excess fluid, anti-hypertensive medications and digoxin which helps to improve the pumping ability of the heart. Treatment is always individualised and depending on the combination of medication used, will determine if any adverse effects may arise. <A HREF="mailto:enquiries@gac.com.au">E-mail</A> us with your specific enquiry.<p>

<LI>Stop smoking (if you already smoke cigarettes).
<LI>Observe a diet low in fat and cholesterol.
<LI>Regular exercise.
<LI>Keep body weight within recommended levels (See the weight for height chart).
<LI>Close control of blood pressure - you may even consider using a blood pressure monitor.
<LI>Have an annual medical examination.
<LI>If your afflicted, closely controlling your diabetes.
<LI>Recent evidence suggests that daily vitamin E in doses of around 200-400 I.U. can decrease the level of LDL (bad cholesterol) and decrease the effect cholesterol has on coronary arteries. This may decrease the risk of coronary artery disease by up to 40%. Consider Nature's Own Vitamin E Capsules 250 I.U., or Amcal Vitamin E Capsules 250 I.U.

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
Over the last decade there has been much publicity regarding the role of cholesterol and its effect upon coronary artery disease. A high level of cholesterol in the blood stream is considered to a be a risk factor in the development of coronary vascular disease - however, removing cholesterol from the diet alone may not be sufficient, as the body manufactures its own cholesterol from raw fat materials.<p>

Decreasing the amount of saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet will significantly reduce blood levels. It is known that high blood levels of cholesterol over extended periods contribute to the development of atherosclerosis (blood vessel narrowing). Cholesterol is a waxy, yellowish substance produced by the liver; its role in the body includes digestion, hormone production, building blocks for cell membranes, vitamin D production and much more.<p>

While the body is capable of producing all the necessary cholesterol for its own use, in general it produces only around 65% in lieu of dietary cholesterol consumption from animal products such as meat and offal.
Cholesterol and other fats are insoluble in water and are carried in the blood by lipoproteins (consisting of protein and fat/triglyceride) - each lipoprotein carries different levels of cholesterol and to different areas of the body.<p>

In general LDL (low density lipoproteins) carries cholesterol from the liver to the body cells; while HDL (high density lipoprotein) carries cholesterol from the body cells to the liver for excretion. An ideal level of cholesterol has not effectively been determined yet, but a guideline of below 5.5 mmol/L (around 200 mg/dL) has been recommended. <p>

<H3>Dietary Recommendations</H3>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
<LI>Lower the amount of total fat in your diet by eating fewer high fat foods. High fat foods often contain large amounts of saturated fats.
<LI>Lower the amount of saturated fats while increasing the amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet.
<LI>Lower cholesterol intake. Eat more fruit and vegetables and less animal products.
<LI>Eat more complex carbohydrates containing starch and fibre (rice, potatoes) as these foods contain no cholesterol.
<LI>Lose weight by decreasing the amount of calories consumed and increasing the amount of calories used (exercise).
</OL><p>

To eat less total fat;
<OL TYPE=A START="1">
<LI>Within in any food category there are high and low fat items. Read supermarket labels to learn which foods are low in fat.
<LI>Sausage and most processed luncheon meats are high in fat.
<LI>Cream, sour cream, ice cream, butter, and many cheeses are high in fat.
</OL><p>


To eat less Saturated fat;
<OL TYPE=A START="1">
<LI>Most animal fats generally contain high proportions of saturated fat, whereas the fat in chicken and fish contains higher proportions of polyunsaturated fats. 
<LI>Vegetable oils from palm kernel, coconut are high in saturated fat.
<LI>Vegetable oils with high proportions of polyunsaturated fats include safflower oil, sunflower oil, corn and soybean oils.
</OL><p>

To eat less cholesterol;
<OL TYPE=A START="1">
<LI>Eat less red meat, organ meats (liver, kidney, sweetbread, brain), egg yolks, lobster and shrimp.
</OL><p>

To eat more complex carbohydrates;
<OL TYPE=A START="1">
<LI>Eat vegetables, fruits, cereal grains, dried peas, beans, rice, pasta.
</OL><p>

We'd love to here from you with any healthy heart recipes - why not <A HREF="mailto:enquiries@gac.com.au">E-mail</A> !!!<p>

<IMG SRC="product/Max%20EPA.jpg" ALT="Nature's Own - Max EPA" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="83" HEIGHT="126" BORDER="0" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="5">
<H3>Marine Lipids (EPA) and Other Beneficial Nutrients</H3>
<B>EPA (eicosapentanoic acid)</B> is a special fish oil ingredient derived from fish in cold deep waters of the ocean - it should not be confused with cod liver oil. Marine Lipids are very high in EPA and DHA; studies involving the high fish diets of the Canadian Eskimos have shown that they have a very low incidence of heart disease, even though the fish they eat is of the oily variety.<p>

The polyunsaturated nature of this fish oil, not only ensures that it contains no cholesterol, but may also be active in reducing harmful fats in the blood. The recommended dose to achieve a reasonable lipid lowering effect is 6-15g/day. Natures Own MaxEPA 1000mg at a dose of 2 capsules three times a day (with each meal) is a suitable brand to assist with reducing your cholesterol levels.<p>

Recent evidence also suggests that daily vitamin E in doses of around 200-400 I.U. can decrease the level of LDL (bad cholesterol) and decrease the effect cholesterol has on coronary arteries. This may decrease the risk of coronary artery disease by up to 40%. Consider Nature's Own Vitamin E Capsules 250 I.U., or Amcal Vitamin E Capsules 250 I.U.<p>

Like vitamin E, beta carotene has an antioxidant effect as well as significant positive effects on the lipid profile in the blood. Recent research has demonstrated that with patients supplemented with beta carotene, significant increases in the ratio of HDL to LDL have been reported (HDL being "good" cholesterol that reduces the risk of coronary heart disease). Other studies including one involving 22,000 male doctors has demonstrated  that those supplemented with beta carotene, showed a significantly less chance of heart attack and stroke.<p>

The systolic blood pressure (the top number in your blood pressure readings, maximum pressure when the heart is pumping) is too high if consistently above 140 and the diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number, pressure when the heart is fully relaxed) is too high when consistently above 90 - remember that stressful situations, and emotional stress will raise your blood pressure as part of a normal physiological reaction - even the trepidation of visiting the doctor may elevate your reading.<p>

<H3>General Guidelines</H3><p>

<PRE>Diastolic Blood Pressure (Adults)	Consideration
below 85 mmHg				Normal
85-89 mmHg				High, but normal.
90-104 mmHg				Mild hypertension.
105-114 mmHg				Moderate hypertension.
115 mmHg and above			Sever hypertension.</PRE><p>

If your diastolic blood pressure is below 90 mmHg and your systolic is below 140 mmHg this is considered normal. Systolic 140-159 mmHg, is borderline hypertension. Systolic pressure above 160 mmHg and Diastolic below 90 mmHg, is considered to be systolic hypertension. In Australia, 19% of men are considered to suffer with hypertension, and 14% of women.<p>

Hypertension may occur secondarily to a wide variety of problems - unfortunately, most cases of hypertension are termed "essential hypertension", which occurs for reasons unknown. However, below is a small list of reasons, that could attribute to hypertension in adults.<p>

<OL TYPE=A START="1">
	<LI>Kidney Failure.
	<LI>Chronic glomerulonephritis (kidney inflammation).
	<LI>Renal Artery Stenosis (narrowing of the artery that supplied the kidneys).
	<LI>Some kidney tumors.
	<LI>Adrenal glad disease (Cushing's disease) and tumors. 
	<LI>Hyperthyroidism (over-active thyroid gland).
	<LI>Hyperparathyroidism.
	<LI>Anabolic steroids.
	<LI>Oral contraceptives.
	<LI>Anti-inflammatory drugs (rare)
	<LI>Cocaine/Crack.
	<LI>Amphetamines.
	<LI>Alcohol withdrawal.
	<LI>Pre-eclampsia (condition associated with later stages of pregnancy).
	<LI>Acute pain.
	<LI>Acute stress.
</OL><p>

The effects of hypertension on the heart can be likened to driving your automobile with a trailer behind it - one would surely not expect the engine in your automobile to last as long, compared to if the trailer was not there. Hypertension is a major risk factor in the development of heart disease and stroke because of its effect on accelerating atherosclerotic vascular disease (narrowing of the blood vessels) which may lead to heart attack or stroke.<p>

Chronic hypertension can also lead to kidney impairment or in severe cases renal failure, retinal disease (eyes) leading to temporary or partial loss of sight, cerebral (brain) haemorrhage, and hypertrophy (enlargement) of the left ventricle leading to myocardial ischaemia.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Cigarette smoking is considered the largest preventable health problem in Australia, and it estimated that of all deaths, 16% of them occur prematurely, secondary to the smoking habit. Cigarette smoke is a complex mixture of some 4,000 individual constituents.<p>

Tar is the total particulate matter of the smoke once the water vapour and nicotine have been removed, and it is the tar that contains the bulk of the carcinogenic effect of whole smoke. Cigarette smokers have almost twice the risk as a nonsmoker of having a myocardial infarction (heart attack), or of dying of coronary artery disease.<p>

The relative risks for sudden death from coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and aortic aneurysm are also elevated. The magnitude of the risk of coronary artery disease associated with smoking is as great as the risk associated with hypertension or elevated cholesterol; there are, however - a larger percentage of the population that have smoking as the single most avoidable risk factor of heart of disease. The quote of many cigarette packets that "Smoking Kills" is never a truer word said.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/quitlogo.jpg" ALT="Quit Logo" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="85" BORDER="0">
<H3>So...How do I Quit ???</H3>
Smoking usually starts due to various social factors, and continues due to both psychological and pharmacological (drug) dependence. Initially, a smoker experiences subtle social and physical rewards from smoking, which reinforces the smoking habit.<p>

Once the body becomes accustomed to regular doses of nicotine, the cigarette is smoked not only for the pleasure it brings, but also to abate the discomfort that nicotine withdrawal brings. The physical dependence that exists can cause therefore withdrawal symptoms which include headache, irritability, tiredness, constipation, cramps, insomnia, and depression.<p>

The level to which a smoker is addicted to nicotine compared with the actual social or psychological addiction varies from person to person.<p>

Here's how to assess the degree of nicotine dependence before deciding whether nicotine replacement therapy is best for you.<p>


<H4>1. How soon after you wake do you smoke your first cigarette?</H4>
Within 30 minutes	1
After 30 minutes	0
	<p>

<H4>2. Do you find it difficult to refrain from smoking in places where it is forbidden (eg: church, library, cinemas)?</H4>
Yes	1<p>

No	0<p>

<H4>3. Which cigarette would you hate to give up?</H4>
First in morning	1<p>

Any Other	0<p>

<H4>4. How many cigarettes a day do you smoke?</H4>
15 or less	0<p>

16-25	1<p>

26 or more	2<p>

<H4>5. Do you smoke more frequently during the morning than during the rest of the day?</H4>
Yes	1<p>

No	0<p>

<H4>6. Do you smoke if you are sick enough to stay in bed?</H4>
Yes	1<p>

No	0<p>

<H4>7. What is the nicotine level of your usual brand of cigarettes?</H4>
0.9mg or less	0<p>

1.0mg-1.2mg	1<p>

1.3mg or more	2<p>

<H4>8. Do you inhale?</H4>
Never	0<p>

Sometimes	1<p>

Always	2<p>


<H2>Add your total score.</H2><p>

<H4>How does your score rate on the scale of physical dependence ?</H4>
Low	0-4<p>

Medium	5-7<p>

High (above)	7<p>


If your score is is the medium or high range, you'll probably find that Nicotine Replacement Therapy may be of assistance - of in the low range, there is a good chance that dedication and sheer will power is enough to help you through.<p>

Nicotine Replacement Therapy, can be used to assist you as the smoker to stop the habit of smoking, and start your body on the road to recovery. NRT provides nicotine to satisfy the patients "drug addiction" to that chemical - in doing this, it allows the individual to tackle whatever social and psychological dependencies that might exist. Once the patient has mastered the social/psychological aspect of smoking, his/her energies can then be directed at dealing with nicotine addiction, and gradually living without that chemical. Nicotine comes in gum and transdermal patches - discuss with your doctor the benefits of quitting smoking, and the suitability of this type of treatment with regard to your health and fitness.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/diasysgc.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="116" HEIGHT="142" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">In general, your cholesterol testing and the interpretation of those results is done by your physician or cardiologist - cholesterol blood tests are taken normally after fasting for around 12 hours to obtain an accurate result. Should you wish to monitor your cholesterol readings at home however, meters are available to measure a total cholesterol level in capillary blood.<p>

<H3>The Accutrend  GC</H3>
<B>"I would like a meter that can test my cholesterol as well as my glucose."</B><p>

<B>The Accutrend GC</B> has all the benefits of the Accutrend meter for glucose testing with the additional feature of cholesterol testing.  Using Accutrend Cholesterol strips, a result is given in just three minutes!  The Accutrend GC has a test memory of 20 cholesterol and 50 glucose results with time and date for added convenience.  If you want the flexibility to monitor both glucose and cholesterol, then the only meter for you is the Accutrend GC.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
Treatment of your elevated blood pressure condition will initially include attention to sodium intake (salt intake) - a reduced salt intake should be immediately undertaken, remembering that "diet salts" or "low-sodium salts" in your supermarket may not be a suitable alternative, as many have excessively high levels of potassium.<p>

Excess weight reduction may be required and a carefully planned exercise routine from your doctor will help to condition your circulation. Even with careful attention to you lifestyle, sometimes medication is required to control elevated blood pressure. Most medications fall into major groups.<p>

<OL TYPE=A START="1">
<LI>Beta Blockers
Includes drugs such as atenolol (Tenormin, Noten), propranolol (Inderal, Deralin), metoprolol (Lopressor, Betaloc, Minax). These medications lower blood pressure by reducing the effect of beta receptors on the circulatory system - stimulation of beta1 receptors causes increased heart rate, constriction of blood vessels (therefore increased blood pressure) and a range of other effects - the aforementioned drugs can therefore reduce blood pressure by "dilating blood vessels" so to speak.<p>

Untoward effects of beta blockers in general terms include aggravation of asthma in susceptible individuals, dizziness, nightmares. When first starting treatment on these types of medicines, dizziness and light headedness may occur especially when standing or rising from a sitting or lying down position - this effect normally lasts no longer than 24 hours, and is termed the first dose phenomenon. Treatment must be maintained as sudden withdrawal can cause heart palpitations, angina, myocardial infarction and even death.<p>

Maintain your treatment at all times in conjunction with a low sodium diet, regular exercise and relaxation. For specific enquiries regarding your drug treatment, why not contact one of our pharmacists.<p>

<LI>ACE Inhibitors
By far and away, one of the most commonly used types of drugs in the treatment of hypertension. Drugs in this group include (brand names) Zestril, Capoten, Renitec, Amprace, Prinivil, Norvasc, Coversyl. ACE is an abbreviation for Angiotensin Converting Enzyme. Angiotensin I is secreted by the kidneys in order to assist in the maintenance of stable blood pressure - angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by ACE which causes vasoconstriction, thereby increasing blood pressure; increased force of heart contraction, but as the blood pressure increases, so the required amount of angiotensin II is lessened - a delicate, second by second secretion of angiotensin I is maintained.<p>

By interfering with ACE, there is a reduced level of angiotensin II, which therefore helps to reduce blood pressure. It is important to note that the renin-angiotensin homeostatic system not only regulates blood pressure, but also water and electrolyte balance (sodium and potassium).<p>

In general, these drugs are extremely well tolerated; the newer ACE inhibitors have a long duration of action, and are metabolised/excreted in both the kidneys and liver. Common adverse effects include potassium retention - potassium is retained in the body in greater levels, so avoid ingesting large levels of potassium; "low-sodium salt" from the supermarket; bananas. In some of the older ACE inhibitors such as Renitec and Capoten, a tickle in the throat may cause an irritating cough from time to time, rarely is this a concern; loss of taste has been reported with high doses of captopril.<p>

For more information regarding your drug treatment <A HREF="mailto:enquiries@gac.com.au">E-mail</A> one of our On-Line Pharmacists.<p>

<LI>Calcium Channel Blockers
Drugs of this group are effective anti-hypertensives and are suitable for first line therapy, particularly in older patients, asthmatics, those with angina or peripheral vascular disease and in some cases patients with supraventricular arrhythmia's. These drugs are generally of shorter duration, and quite often will require a twice daily dose to provide smooth blood pressure control. <p>

Common side effects of this group of drugs which includes, Isoptin, Cordilox, Plendil, Veracaps, Cardizem, and Adalat, are flushing, palpitations, and ankle oedema. Unlike verapamil (Isoptin) and diltiazem (Plendil); nifedipine (Adalat) and felodopine (Plendil) can be used with a beta blocker as they do not slow the heart. For more information regarding your drug treatment contact one of our On-Line Pharmacists.<p>

<LI>Diuretics
Drugs of this group act by causing a renal loss of sodium and water, with a reduction in intravascular volume and cardiac output - in general, secondary adjustments by the body restore cardiac output, but blood pressure control is maintained through peripheral vasodilatation.<p>

Drugs in this group include Lasix, Chlotride, Amiloride, Urex, Natrilix. Common side effects include fatigue and muscle cramps. For more information regarding your drug treatment contact one of our On-Line Pharmacists.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Travellers diarrhoea is usually a food/drink borne infection of persons travelling from industrialised countries to developing areas. Enterotoxigenic E.coli cause up to 40-70% of infections. Other pathogens include Shigella sp., Campylobacter sp., Giardia lamblia, Entamoedba histolytica and Aeromonas sp. In 10 to35% of cases, the cause remains unknown. In general a diagnosis is made upon the clinical signs and symptoms coupled with faecal examination.<p>

Fortunately, most conditions of this nature resolve themselves without the need for antimicrobial drugs, which in fact can aggravate certain conditions. For general travellers diarrhoea (lovingly known as "Dehli Belly", or "Bali Belly") a coarse of Co-trimoxazole (Bactrim/Septrin) is sometime given along with electrolyte replacement therapy (Gastrolyte) to assist with the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance; anti-diarrhoea agents are also given to relieve symptoms, however, these types of medications do not contribute to the resolution of the condition. Examples of anti-diarrheoa treatments include Imodium and Lomotil and these treatment require a prescription from your doctor and an appropriate diagnosis. <p>

It is vital to maintain fluid and electrolyte levels, so when travelling we recommend in your luggage to include a one litre bottle of spring water and a packet of Gastrolyte. Gastrolyte is a specially formulated rehydration formula to ensure maximum absorption of electrolytes and water - while it does resolve the condition, it will improve energy levels, and help to reduce dehydration and cramps. If fever and pain are present, paracetamol formulas can be taken to help relieve symptoms.<p>

To avoid travellers diarrheoa - simply eat sensibly, and avoid drinking water that you can confirm the source of, including ice blocks - all bottled water/spring water is considered to be safe. If you are unable to obtain bottled water in the area that you will be visiting, it is advisable to carry with you water purification tablets - the most commonly known brand is Puritabs and these can be dropped into a fairly large quantity of water to ensure safety.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Travel or Motion Sickness is not a disease but is the normal response of an individual to unaccustomed motion of sufficient intensity and duration. Its cause is thought to be a mismatch between the actual and expected sensory input for motion detectors in the body. Sea sickness is the most common form, the occurrence depending upon vessel size and sea conditions; however, the greatest number of sufferers have symptoms due to car or bus travel. Motion sickness is most common in the 3 to 12 year age bracket.<p>

The most common symptoms include nausea, pallor, cold sweating and vomiting. In addition, burping, sighing, yawning, hyperventilation, light headedness, and somnolence may also be experienced. Symptoms are normally of slow onset, with a sudden intensification to vomiting which can often provide a temporary improvement followed by a cyclical recurrence if the stimulus for the sickness continues. <p>

Treatment involves avoiding or escaping the causative motion, but if this is not possible then to minimise the motion abnormality by behavioural measures such as;<p>

<OL>
	<LI>Ideally be in control of the vehicle but if not keep mental busy.
	<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>Avoid searching and scanning tasks such as reading.
	<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>Sit near the centre of gravity of the vehicle.
	<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>Avoid unnecessary head movements, actively or by using a head support such as a travel pillow.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>Fix your gaze upon a stable external reference point such as the horizon or the road ahead.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>If unable to see out of the vehicle, close the eyes.
	<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>Reclining the seating position sometimes may help.
</OL><p>

The doctor can recommend a medication suitable for your situation. Although antimotion sickness drugs are of proven efficacy, none is wholly effective if the stimulus is sufficient, and none is specific for any particular motion nor for motion sickness in general. All are more effective if used before exposure to the causative motion, but unfortunately all can have central nervous system side effects which can often limit the dose.  Actual drugs often used include hyoscine (scopolamine), dimenhydrinate, promethazine and sometimes ephedrine. Some of these medications may interfere with your regular medications, so please contact the On-Line pharmacist for advice in regard to your individual situation.<p>

If you are concerned about the potential sedative effects of antimotion sickness drugs, then consider a natural alternative such as Ginger. Perhaps one of Gingers most valuable benefits is its ability to soothe the stomach and allay feelings of nausea. This anti-nausea action makes it a marvelous travelling companion to those who suffer from motion sickness.<p>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#6072FF">"A recent scientific investigation found conclusively that the gentle, natural relief Ginger brings to nauseous travellers is MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUG DIMENHYDRINATE."</FONT></CENTER><p>

It is thought that ginger's aromatic and carminative properties are most active directly in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby blocking any stomach reactions and subsequent nausea feedback. Natural Nutrition Calm Quick contains 750mg of Ginger along with chamomile, cinnamon bark oil, peppermint oil - this natural blend works together to relieve stomach upsets, indigestion, nausea, and muscular spasms/cramps. It is non-sedating, fast acting and completely natural. <p>

Inevitably when travelling, a healthcare issue will arise. It is important when preparing for your vacation to tackle any health issues before leaving. They include;<p>

<OL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Travel insurance (make sure you have health cover). 
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>Immunisation against diseases such as cholera or typhoid.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>Take ample supplies of regular prescription medication (if you are taking medication other than prescription medication, it is wise to have your pharmacist label with your name and with directions and with what it is used for)
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>If travelling to warmer climates, take a suitable sunscreen, preferably one with an SPF of 15+.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>Insect repellent if your are travelling to an area where malaria is present.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>Water purification tablets if travelling to urban areas where safe water is not available.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>Take a first aid kit for general injuries and healthcare - healthcare in some countries is not only sometimes dubious, but also, often expensive.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>Clear any existing respiratory conditions like colds, hayfever and so forth as these conditions can affect the ears and sinuses when travelling by aeroplane. Your physician may need to prescribe some specific treatment for your condition.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

	<LI>If you are planning to take a nebuliser on an aeroplane, for your asthma, ensure that not only will the airline allow this, but that you have the appropriate adaptors to allow it to be used in an emergency and overseas when you arrive at your destination.
</OL><p>

These are only some general tips - as long as you have travel insurance, a good supply of your regular medicine, have packed for an emergency, are immunised and have a bottle of sunscreen and insect repellant - everything should fall into place.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every adult, whether travelling or not must be immunised against tetanus, diphtheria and poliomyelitis and receive booster doses at appropriate intervals. Every must fulfill the immunisation requirements of the health authorities of each different country included in their destination.<p>

Below is a list of the most common immunisations required for adults who are travelling. If you are unsure, why not E-mail us for advice or contact your physician immediately.<p>

<H3>Tetanus</H3>
A booster injection of 0.5ml tetanus toxoid for adult use every 7-10 years for all destinations.<p>

<H3>Diphtheria</H3>
Because diphtheria is still prevalent in many parts of the world, a booster injection of diphtheria toxoid for adult use is indicated. This is usually given in combination with tetanus toxoid purified.<p>

<H3>Poliolyelitis</H3>
Adults who have previously been immunised against polio should receive oral poliovaccine again. Only those who have never been immunised or immunosuppressed or immunodeficient should be given inactivated trivalent vaccine (at least 3 doses) before travel into endemic areas.<p>

<H3>Smallpox</H3>
As of 1980, smallpox has been eradicated from the world. Smallpox vaccination is no longer administered to the general public, an a vaccination certificate is no longer required of travelers. Often, military personnel continue to be vaccinated, especially in the U.S.<p>

<H3>Typhoid</H3>
A suspension of Salmonella typhi can provide effective immunity. Two doses are given 4 weeks or more apart, and a single booster dose is given once every 3 years for probable exposure. Oral typhoid capsules are now available which give a superior immunity to this condition than the injection - the treatment involves taking 3 capsules, on alternate days. This vaccine should be given for all third world countries, and also including South East Asia, Africa, South America, and the Middle East.<p>

<H3>Yellow Fever</H3>
Live attenuated yellow fever virus, 0.5ml subcutaneously, is given for people travelling to Africa and South America. A World Health Organisation certificate is required and this will contain the manufacturer and the batch number of the vaccine. Vaccination is normally given every 10 years. Without this vaccine, you may be held in quarantine for up to 3 weeks, once returning to a non-Yellow Fever zone.<p>

<H3>Cholera</H3>
Cholera vaccine is a suspension of killed vibrios, including prevalent antigenic types. Two injections are given intramuscularly 4-6 weeks apart. This must be followed by booster injections every 6 months during periods of possible exposure. Protection is largely dependent upon booster doses. Required for the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa and occasionally some others.<p>

<H3>Plague</H3>
A suspension of killed plague bacilli given intramuscularly is required when travelling to some parts of South America and South East Asia. The coarse consists of 3 injection given 4 weeks or more apart.<p>

<H3>Hepatitis A and B</H3>
While these conditions are not necessarily directly travel related it is advisable to seek advice from your doctor when travelling to Africa or South America.<p>

<H3>Rabies</H3>
Only required for travellers visiting areas where rabies is common in domestic animals such as India and parts of South America. It usually consists of 3 injections given 1 week apart. <p>

<H3>Malaria</H3>
Malaria is a protazoal infection cause by the plasmodium organism - it is transmitted by the female anopheles mosquito. The infection is a parasitic one where there are stages of intermittent fever which corresponds to large scale lysis (destruction/breakdown) of red blood cells. Other symptoms include sweating and rigors.<p>

There are four species of plasmodium, these being ovale, vivax, malariae, and falciparum - infection from Plasmodium falciparum has a relatively high mortality rate. 66% of the world live in malaria areas and there are some 220 million infections per year. In Africa, malaria is responsible for more than 1 million deaths per year. <p>

In general, the risk of acquiring malaria is small if the traveller stays in quality, centrally located hotels, and returns before dusk from rural areas. The risk of contracting malaria is increased if the traveller is present at the end of the wet season; outdoors in the evening and if inappropriate prophylactic measures are taken.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/melanoma2.jpg" ALT="Solar Allergy" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="125" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Photosensitivity refers to an abnormal reaction to a normal amount of light. It is a relatively common problem that can be  the cause of great discomfort and can severely restrict the lifestyle of the sufferer. Reactions may include skin rashes, itching, reddening and brown patches of skin discolouration. There are two main mechanisms for photosensitivity.<p>

<OL>
<LI>A phototoxic reaction occurs if light energy is absorbed by a molecule, such as a drug, resulting in tissue damage via a reactive chemical species such as free radicals.<p>

<LI>A photoallergic reaction, which occurs if light energy is absorbed by a molecule, causing a chemical or structural change  that then renders that substance allergenic causing an immune reaction.
</OL><p>

<IMG SRC="product/melanoma1.jpg" ALT="Photosensitivity to drugs" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="125" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Photosensitivity reactions may be caused by some systemic (oral) drugs and some topical therapeutic or cosmetic creams and perfumes. A systemic drug can induce a photosensitivity reaction in susceptible individuals because the entire blood volume of a resting adult can circulate through the skin approximately once every 11 minutes. This allows exposure of the drug in the small blood vessels and capillaries present in the dermis, to the penetrating UV-A and visible light and to small amounts of UV-B rays. As these reactions may causes distress to the patient, it is important that the patient is aware of such products, and subsequently an effective sunscreen should be used. <p>

<H3>Drugs Which Can Cause Photosensitivity.</H3>
If you are taking a medication that is listed below, special attention to skincare should be taken, in particular, a broad spectrum sunscreen such as SunSense Milk should be used.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Although your skin has its own natural defence mechanism, it is not enough to prevent the sun's rays from causing problems ranging from mild sunburn and prematurely dry, wrinkled or aged skin, to more serious conditions such as skin cancer.<p>

The so called healthy tan is actually a response to sun damage of the skin. The outer layer becomes thicker and darker in an effort to provide a better barrier against the sun's harmful rays and the skin starts to tan. Even with this natural protection, harmful rays are still able to penetrate this barrier. Therefore additional protection is essential to prevent damage to the deeper layers of the skin.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/sunsense.jpg" ALT="Sunsense Products" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="105" HEIGHT="217" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Whatever your age and regardless of your sun tanning habits to date, it's never too late to start the prevention programme by using SunSense SPF 15+ sunscreens. Skin already damaged by the sun can heal during continued exposure providing an SPF 15+ sunscreen, with additional broad spectrum cover is used. It has been estimated that if everyone used an SPF 15+ sunscreen regularly at least until the age of 18 the number of people getting melanoma could be reduced by over 70%.<p>

Examine your skin regularly and look for any unusual changes or growths. If you are concerned about a skin lesion, consult your doctor as quickly as possible. Skin cancers can be cured if detected and treated early. The appearance of dry leathery skin and the premature formation of wrinkles can be avoided with frequent and regular use of SunSense SPF 15+ sunscreens whenever you skin is exposed to the sun.<p>

<H3>Combine SunSense with Commonsense</H3><p>

<B>These ten commandments might save your life.</B><p>

<OL>
<LI>Minimise sun exposure between the hours of 10am and 2pm when the sun is strongest. (or equivalent times during daylight saving).
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

<LI>When out in the sun (whenever possible) wear a broad rimmed hat, a T-shirt of closely woven material and apply SunSense SPF 15+ sunscreen on all exposed areas of skin.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

<LI>SunSense SPF 15+ should be applied to clean, dry skin 30 minutes before exposure to the sun - this allows the sunscreen to bond to the skin.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

<LI>Sunscreen wear of the skin with normal useage, so re-apply SunSense SPF 15+ at least every 2 hours and after swimming, exercise, heavy perspiration and towelling dry.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

<LI>Protect and explain the necessity of sun protection to your children - it may save their lives. Try to encourage sun protection at school by advocating more tree planting programmes and applying of sunscreens just before recess and lunchtime.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

<LI>Apply SunSense SPF 15+ even when sitting in the shade. Surfaces such as sand, water, snow and concrete can reflect the sun's rays onto your skin even though you are in the shade.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

<LI>Apply SunSense SPF 15+ on overcast days, particularly in summer as the damaging sun's rays can easily penetrate on cloudy days.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

<LI>Sports lovers are particularly at risk. The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) recommends the use of SunSense to their athletes. Remember to use SunSense SPF 15+ when you are playing golf, tennis, lawn bowls, cricket or any other outdoor sport.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

<LI>Use SunSense SPF 15+ during high altitude activities such as skiing and mountain climbing. At high altitudes, the risk of sunburn is even greater because there is less atmosphere to absorb the sun's rays.
<hr size=2 width=100%><p>

<LI>Don't just wear SunSense in the summer. The sun shines all year round and can damage your skin even during winter. Use SunSense every day, particularly on you face and the backs of your hands to help prevent dry, leathery skin, wrinkles, mottling  and other signs of premature ageing as well as more serious problems such as skin cancer.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="product/melanoma10.jpg" ALT="Solar Keratosis" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="121" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">For years, we have heard about the danger of ultra-violet (UV) rays. In fact UV-A and UV-B rays are recognised as being mostly responsible for sunburn, premature ageing, leathery mottled skin and more serious conditions such as skin cancer.<p>

A sunscreen that protects us from both UV-A rays and UV-B rays is called a broad spectrum sunscreen. UV-C rays are potentially more dangerous, but don't reach the Earth's surface as they are blocked out by the ozone layer. UV-C rays can also be generated on earth, for instance during welding. Protection from exposure to UV-C rays may be an important consideration for some industrial workers.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/melanoma3.jpg" ALT="Squamous cell carcinoma" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="125" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10"><H3>Infra-Red and Visible Light Rays</H3>
Until now, little emphasis has been placed on protecting ourselves from other forms of harmful solar radiation; these being infra-red and visible light. These rays penetrate vene more deeply into the body than UV rays.<p>

Like UV rays infra-red also contributes to premature ageing of the skin and worsens and accelerates the harmful effects of ultra violet rays. Visible light is predominantly responsible for photo-sensitivity and other less common skin conditions. You may have thought you were protecting your skin by using an ordinary supermarket brand sunscreen, but you were not really as well protected as you should have been.<p>

<H3>Ego Sunsense SPF 15+ Protects Deeper Layers of Your Skin</H3>
Quite simply, you need to use the sunscreen that protects you from as many of the sun's harmful rays as possible. Ordinary SPF 15+ sunscreens only protect you from the UV-A and UV-B rays. SunSense offers protection against all the sun's rays known to damage skin. The SunSense range not only provides SPF 15+ protection against UV rays, but it also protects you from the real dangers of infra-red and visible light rays. In Australia, where SunSense was developed and is manufactured, the highest SPF allowed on the label is 15+. For a sunscreen to be labelled 15+ is must have an SPF of at least 16. All SunSense products meet or exceed this standard. Any sunscreen with an SPF lower than 15+ is not giving you the highest possible protection against skin cancer.<p>

Sun damage is cumulative. Blistering or painful sunburn in childhood and adolescence is associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. Just one single blistering sunburn in adolescence doubles the risk of developing skin cancer later in life. Repeated sun tanning contributes to premature ageing of the skin and increases the risk of skin cancer. The grading of skin types to help you choose the right protection factor for your skin is irrelevant if you are concerned about skin cancer or premature ageing.<p>

<H3>Aniseed</H3>
Aniseed oil is a steam distilled essential oil derived from the seeds of aniseed. It was revered by ancient civilisations and used by the Egyptians in the making of bread, liqueurs and aperitifs for its calming influence on the digestive tract. The seeds of the Pimpinella anisum plant are distilled to yield a light yellow oil with a strong liquorice-like flavour and bouquet.

<H3>Lemon</H3>
With the return of the Crusaders from the Holy Wars of the Middle Ages came rich treasures; one of these was the humble lemon.

Amber to dark orange in colour, this Base Note oil was made popular in its perfuming of Indian shawls.  Reaction to its exotically hot and heavy perfume varies from apprehension to immense pleasure.  This oil is a disinfectant which will act as a lasting protector for your clothes.  Patchouli makes an excellent topical treatment for athlete's foot and impetigo having great germicidal properties; use Direct Application.

Peppermint appears predominantly in the Eastern and Western commercial world in the form of after dinner mints, toothpastes and breath fresheners.

<H3>Sandalwood</H3>
This oil is extracted from the innermost heartwood of Santalum album, a slow growing evergreen from the Indian mountains of Mysore.  Only trees at the end of their natural life span are used.  This stirring, sense-exciting scent is similar to the musky molecules of androsterone, a male pheromone or mating signal and carries a soft honey-sweet. woody balsamic aroma.  This oil is a Base Note, having great lasting appeal.  For temporary relief of bronchial cough and sore throats use in a Massage Oil Blend, and apply to the throat, chest and back.  In a Massage Oil Blend or in a Therapeutic Bath, Sandalwood is well received by both men and women.  For temporary relief of the pain and burning sensation associated with cystitis; use as a douche by adding 5 drops of Sandalwood to a litre of cool water.  <B>If pain or irritation persists for more than 48 hours, consult your doctor.</B>  The presence of blood in the urine warrants <B>immediate medical attention</B>.  Sandalwood makes a soothing, moisturising Skin or Facial Oil for most skin types, but especially cracked, chapped, itchy or dry skin.  Use Direct Application to ease shaving rash or as an earthy, spiced personal perfume or aftercare.<p>

<H3>Tea Tree</H3>
This wonderful healing oil is distilled from the young tops of the Melaleuca alternifolia trees grown in the Coraki area of northern New South Wales.  Tea Tree is prized world-wide for its non-irritant, tissue friendly healing properties.  This Top Note oil is a must for first aid kits.  Apply Tea Tree using Direct Application to cuts, tropical ulcers, pierced ears, nail infections, tinea, ringworm, wounds and insect bites.  For the relief of symptoms of acne, cold sores, mouth ulcers, boils and pimples use Direct Application dabbing on with a cotton bud.  This oil promotes strong healing without scarring.  To relieve the symptoms of flu apply a few drops to your handkerchief or your pillow, or make up a Steam Inhalation.  Tea Tree has temporary warm feeling when applied, which soon subsides and has a calming effect.  A broad spectrum antifungal, use as a mouthwash for mouth ulcers, bleeding gums or oral thrush, following dental surgery or as a gargle for sore throats.  Do not swallow.  Avoid contact with eyes.  For external use only.  If poisoning occurs get to a doctor quickly.  If swallowed do not induce vomiting, give a glass of water.<p>

<H3>Wintergreen</H3>
As a native herb to North America, the Indians discovered Wintergreen's amazing cooling actions and used to chew the herb or make a refreshing herbal tea infusion.  Current in the British Herbal Pharmacopoeia, the dried leaf and stem is stated as specific for rheumatoid arthritis.  This oil is distilled from the leaves of Gaultberia procumbens in China and is one of China's most respected natural liniments.  Wintergreen has a characteristic, deep penetrating, balsamic, spicy-sweet odour. Wintergreen's lively, heating and cooling mentholated power gives temporary relief to the symptoms of muscular, arthritic and rheumatic aches and pains; use a Massage Oil Blend with a ratio of 5 drops Wintergreen to 10ml Sunspirit carrier oil and rub as a liniment into the affected areas.

Known in the Philippines as the 'flower of flowers', these erotic blossoms are spread over the beds of island newly-weds to heighten their honeymoon and lull first-night nerves.  This oil is a Middle to Base Note.  Ylang Ylang's intoxicating, exotic scent relaxes stressful states into luxurious languor, transforms the Therapeutic Bath and a massage with a Massage oil Blend into a scentual event.  Ylang Ylang brings relief to insect bites;  use Direct Application and enjoy the tropical calm.  In a Skin or Facial Oil, Ylang Ylang has a normalising action on an over-oily skin.  For temporary relief of intestinal infections, flatulence and diarrhoea; massage the stomach in a clockwise direction with a Massage Oil Blend.  If symptoms persist, seek medical advice.  A few drops in 50ml of shampoo encourages healthy hair growth, and a couple of drops on the palm makes a balancing brilliantine for oily hair.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Aromatherapy oils are extremely concentrated, in many cases too strong to be applied undiluted to the skin's surface, so should be used with care. A carrier oil, often referred to as a base oil, should be employed as a means of extending or diluting your essential oils to make up your personal massage, skin or facial oil blends.<p>

Avoid eyes and sensitive areas. Certain oils should be avoided during specific health conditions, while others may be wonderfully appropriate. Please check our advice before using. Your essential oils should be stored away from heat, light and air. Keep containers tightly closed when not in use.<p>

<H3>Taking Note of Your Oils</H3>
Essential oils are rated for their volatility and categorised by perfumeries into Top, Middle and Base notes. Top notes vapourise quickly and require the most care in storage as they are the most volatile. Base notes are the slowest to evapourate.<p>

The most balanced and lasting oil combination for an Aromatherapy blend is one that includes a Top, Middle and Base note. We have included details of each oil's Note to help you create a balanced and lasting personal blend.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Natural Essential Oils are highly concentrated plant extracts obtained through distillation or expression from flowers, berries, seeds, roots, barks and citrus rinds, and despite their name are not oily or greasy. The price of essential oils depends entirely on the oil yield of each individual plant - for instance, the petals of 30 roses yield a single drop of Rose oil, hence its expense, though many higher-yield essential oils are very inexpensive.<p>

<H3>Steam Distillation</H3>
This is the most common extraction method for essential oils. In the direct method of steam distillation, a still is charged with plant material to be processed. Steam is then introduced at the base of the still and the volatile elements of the plant source mix with the steam. This vapour-mix separates by way of condensation into a liquid form of water and essential oil - the oil floats on top of the water and is separated off.<p>

<H3>Cold Pressing</H3>
This method is also known as expression and is used exclusively for citrus oils. This is a very mild and gentle pressing treatment in which the outer layer of the peel is ruptured and the oil is then pressed out. Carrier oils are extracted in a similar method in which the seeds are crushed and the oil is pressed out.<p>

<H3>Synthetic Fragrances</H3>
Synthetic fragrances or fragrant oils as they are commonly known are synthetically manufactured in a laboratory. Technically speaking, fragrant oils are not oils - they are in fact man-made, aromatic chemical compounds - with an oily nature. These products usually carry exotic, floral, and fruity names even though they are not extracted from the plant or fruit they are named after. For example, there is no such thing as a true peach, strawberry or rainforrest oil and real carnation oil actually smells like clove oil because of its high content of the ingredient eugenol. While smelling pleasant, fragrant oils have no therapeutic value as they lack the undiluted, active ingredients of the natural plant. Certainly they cannot be taken medicinally and in some cases should not be used directly on the skin. It is questionable whether fragrant oils should be vapourised in oil burners as no safety data is available on this.<p>

<H3>Solvent Extraction</H3>
Solvent extraction is primarily used in the production of absolutes. This is a gentle procedure by which aromatic substances are drawn out of the plant material by means of non-polar solvents. The solvents are separated and the remaining solvent-free waxy residue is mixed with alcohol and heated very carefully to undergo a filtering process in which the waxes are removed. The alcohol is then removed and the final end product in termed the absolute.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Therapeutic Bath</H3>
Add 5 drops of your chosen essential oil or oils to your bath, just before turning off the taps. This ensures most of the therapeutic aromas are not lost before you have time to immerse and enjoy. Where the essential oil is noted as being skin sensitive; mix with a tablespoon of milk, a natural dispersant, before adding your oils to the bath. Alternatively, add 3 cupfuls of premixed massage oil blend and evenly disperse through your bath water.<p>

If you prefer a shower, stop up the drain, sprinkle a few drops of your essential oil into the water and let your feet benefit while you breathe in the scented steam. For an excellent body moisturiser, rub a little of your chosen massage oil blend into the skin at the end of your shower and lightly towel dry.<p>

<H3>Foot Bath</H3>
Soak your feet in warm water with 5 drops of your essential oil or oils. Rinse with cool water, dry and massage your "neglected transporters". Alternatively, mix 3 capfuls of massage oil and blend evenly through the foot bath.<p>

<H3>Massage</H3>
Indulge with a premixed massage oil blend or become your own alchemist by creating a personal massage potion. Blend 5 drops of your chosen essential oil or a combination of essential oils with 10ml of carrier oil to create a therapeutic massage medium. You may use a single carrier oil or a combination of carrier oils as your base. Once mixed, it can then be used for massage. Preferably relax in a tranquil environment, inhaling healing aromas while rich essential oils sink into the skin - this could be the answer to everyday assaults of tension and fatigue.<p>

<H3>Steam Inhalation</H3>
In a bowl containing one litre of steaming water add up to 10 drops of essential oil, cover your head with a towel, lean over the bowl and inhale leisurely.<p>

<H3>Vapourisation</H3>
Fill your oil burner dish with water and light the candle; add up to 5 drops of essential oil, either a single oil or a variety to create your own personal blend - the therapeutic vapour will encompass your senses.<p>

<H3>Direct Application</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Generally there are 4 main types of treatment or a combination thereof.<p>

<b>Firstline Agent/NSAIDS</b><p>

These include simple analgesics such as paracetamol. Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID's) are agents that interfere with the production of prostaglandins and therefore help to reduce pain and inflammation. Examples of NSAID's include Voltaren, Orudis, Feldene, Indocid, Brufen, Dolobid, Surgam, Clinoril, Naprosyn - each individual generally responds differently with each drug, as a result, it sometimes may take your physician a short time to find a suitable agent for you. NSAID's produce a plethora of adverse reactions which include exacerbation of peptic ulceration, nausea, indigestion, and dizziness. Other side effects include aggravation of asthma, skin rashes, and decreased platelet aggregation.<p>

<b>Disease-Modifying Agents also known as Slow Acting Anti Rheumatic Drugs (SARDS).</b><p>

These agents cause a change in the blood serum measurements of certain substances thereby reducing rheumatic factor (an immune complex) - the overall effect of these drugs is to inhibit inflammatory response in the body and suppress synovitis. These types of drugs may slow the progression of the condition but have a slow onset of weeks to months. For chronic sufferers of RA, most will require  treatment with one of these agents. There is increasing evidence that they should be used at an early stage in rheumatoid arthritis in an effort to reduce destructive joint disease. The most common drugs of these type prescribed include;<p>

<OL TYPE="a" START="a">
	<LI>Hydroxychloroquine is useful in very early disease.
	
	<LI>Gold compounds such as auranofin. The most common side effect is diarrhoea.
	
	<LI>D-penicillamine is started at a lose dose and gradually increased. Side effects might include loss of taste and skin rashes.
	
	<LI>Sulphasalazine is also started at a low dose and increased. Adverse effects include indigestion.
</OL><p>

<b>Corticosteroids</b><p>

These agents act to suppress the disease activity and in this they cause a decrease in swelling, pain and morning stiffness as well as increased strength and function. Their effect has a prompt action. Examples include prednisolone, and prednisone. These drugs, along with all arthritis treatments should be taken with food. Sometimes, drugs of this type are actually injected into the joint for an extended effect, which also reduces the systemic side effects.<p>

<b>Immunosuppressive Drugs</b><p>

Generally drugs such as methotrexate, azothiaprine and cyclophosphamide are reserved for severe, progressive  RA which has failed to respond to any other treatment. Usually, these medications are initiated by a specialist in the field of Rheumatoid arthritis. <p>

<b>Surgery</b><p>

Sometimes, relief from a condition such as rheumatoid arthritis may be obtained by a surgical procedure such as synovectomy, arthoplasty or arthrodesis. The main reason for surgery, if elected, will be to reduce pain and help restore function. Joint replacement surgery is common with hips and knees and more recently shoulder joints. Use of new prosthetic materials and cementless prostheses improve the outlook for many patients.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Arthritis is a general term for inflammation of the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis, with a prevalence in the Australian population of between 1-2%, in the US up to 2.5-3% of population groups can suffer from this condition which is included with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, lupus erythematosous, gout and Reiter's Syndrome as one of many Rheumatic conditions.<p>

The peak incidence is between 20 and 40 years of age, with females being affected significantly more than males. However, with increasing age, the male:female ratio equilibrates. There is no single aetiological factor for the cause of RA (Rheumatoid arthritis), however it is thought that genetic makeup, immune response of the patient, and an inciting agent of bacterial or viral origin all play a role - there is no link to race or geographic location. A normal joint is cushioned by cartilage and synovial (joint) fluid; in the rheumatoid joint, the synovium spreads between the joint surfaces.<p>

RA is considered to be an autoimmune disease which involves the formation of immune complexes in the joint - this activates the bodies complement system (a chemical cascade in the immune system) which then attracts white blood cells into the synovial fluid (joint fluid) which eventually consume these immune complexes - at this time enzymes are released along with other mediators of inflammation causing joint erosion and other adverse effects.<p>

Rheumatoid arthritis affects the small joints of the hand, wrists and feet, but also affects the knees, elbows, shoulders, ankles and jaw and it usually is a symmetrical  condition (left and right).<p>

Your doctor is a specialist in diagnosis, and a series of tests may be required to confirm any suspicions of Rheumatoid arthritis - it is not always a simple task to provide a diagnosis, so as the patient you should be just that, patient, and allow your physician to correctly ascertain your condition.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Osteoarthritis is the second most common form of arthritis causing swelling, pain stiffness and sometime deformation of joints. The most commonly affected parts of the body are the large weight bearing joints such as the hips, knees and spine. The hands are also commonly affected. Also known as degenerative joint disease it is characterised by a slow, and progressive form of joint degeneration and inflammation. It is thus, most commonly seen in the middle-aged to elderly population.<p>

Joints are lined with a material known as cartilage, which provide a smooth surface over which the joint can "glide" without difficulty. Degenerative arthritis, causes the destruction of the cartilage - the bone in the joints becomes pitted and as the shock absorbing cartilage becomes rough and worn, as it disappears, the bone begin to rub together and start to wear when flexed. In the process muscles and tendons can become weakened.<p>

Symptoms of osteoarthritis include episodic joint paint, mild swelling, neck stiffness and pain if affected. More advanced cases of osteoarthritis ca result in impingement (compression) of nerve roots giving rise to numbness, tingling, or weakness. <p>

Treatment of Osteoarthritis includes a range of options such as physiotherapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, and weight reduction. Essentially a well balanced diet, high in salads, lightly cooked vegetables, fruit, vegetable juices, garlic & onions (high in sulphur), and soy milk, is necessary; this coupled with exercise that takes the weight off joints such as swimming will greatly assist the treatment of your arthritis condition. Sea water and epsom salt baths may help as do seaweed baths.<p>

<IMG SRC="images/h_art_gout_t1.gif" ALT="Gout" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="57" HEIGHT="24" BORDER="0" VSPACE="5"><BR><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Gout is a recurrent acute arthritis which affects the older population, mainly males over the age of 35, but rarely affecting females or children - there is a genetic link with this condition. Gout is a metabolic disorder of the body chemistry in which too much uric acid and its compounds (urates) accumulate in the blood.<p>

This results in these compounds being deposited in the tissues around joints and tendons. This causes inflammation, redness and swelling with the toes, and fingers usually being affected, but gout can also involve the hand, heel, knee or ear.<p>

The acute attack starts most commonly and unexpectedly at night, and can be extremely painful. Symptoms include a hot, painful, swollen joint. The initial attacks may be few and far between but usually become frequent and prolonged if untreated. Gout, or rather the urates that cause it, are the end product of improper protein metabolism. <p>

Treatment of gout quite obviously is directed at reducing the body's excess uric acid production by firstly tackling diet, the foods to avoid are those that are high in purine protein which the body metabolises to uric acid. These include rich cheeses and wines, red meat, coffee, refined sugars. A largely vegetarian diet, high in vegetables and fruits is recommended. <p>

Anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine and allopurinol are the three main treatments available in conventional medicine - though other medications currently used include probenecid, and sulphinpyrazone. In general a healthy diet, with plenty of water can often keep gout under reasonable control; you may benefit from Equisetum (Horsetail) which is high in silica which helps to reduce uric acid crystallisation in tissue.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Anti-inflammatory gels and creams are available such as benzadyamine and indomethacin. These agents provide the benefits of anti-inflammatory treatment while abating most of the unwanted side effects normally associated with such a treatment, such as gastrointestinal upset, dizziness, aggravation of peptic ulcer. Normally, these products are applied directly to the painful area and gently rubbed in - such a treatment may allow you to discontinue your anti-inflammatory drug, or reduce its dose. Discuss this option with physician.<p>

Pain T.E.M. provides temporary relief of arthritic pain and muscular pain and promotes healing. It consists of a thin, negatively charged membrane that is placed, then compressed onto the painful site. While not suitable for use on open wounds, in pregnancy, or on patients with a pacemaker (or similar device), Pain T.E.M. will often relieve the condition within 48 hours.<p>

Heat Rubs such as Metsal are ideal for short term treatment of muscular aches and arthritis pain. Metsal is a complex formula as used by the Australian Institue of Sport (AIS), and is the strongest cream of its type available in Australia. Creams of this type are often termed coutner irritants and their mechanism of action is to create an over-riding sensation on the skin to "block-out" the pain sensations of arthritis. Arthritis pain, is mainly mediated by chemicals, and the sensation is relatively slowly transmitted to the brain compared to touch/feel sensations of the skin that are electrically transmitted immediately. Although only short acting, agents of this type have few adverse effects and are easily applied.<p>

For more information about your specific drug treatment as currently prescribed, why not contact one of the on-line pharmacists.<p>

<B>Foods to avoid.</B> Sugar, white flour products, cakes, starchy foods, red meat, saturated fats, coffee, tea, cocoa, alcohol.<p>

This diet is basically a low acid diet, with an emphasis on raw foods; this is very easy on the digestive organs, and helps to cleanse the system and avoid constipation. This type of diet also helps to dissolve the accumulation of acid forming, toxic deposits around joints and in other tissues. These are a major cause of many rheumatic and arthritic conditions.<p>

Arthritis sufferers are recommended to take vitamins A, B complex (especially B12), C and Vitamin E, together with the minerals zinc and calcium. A formula such as BioACE by Blackmores or Natural Nutrition Antioxidant Formula may be suitable. Remember in the early stages of your condition it is recommended to exercise gently to keep the joints mobile, but in severe stages, rest is better.<p>

Evening Primrose Oil has been proven beneficial as a natural anti-inflammatory. Evening Primrose oil contains GLA - gamma linolenic acid, and essential ingredient in the vital production of prostaglandins within the human body. Prostaglandins are hormone like compounds that are in constant use and their roles include moderating inflammation. The anti-inflammatory properties of EPO may be of great assistance to those afflicted by rheumatoid arthritis and may even lead to a reduction in the need for prescribed drugs such as NSAID (non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). The does required for evening primrose oil to be effective in assisting the treatment of arthritis is around 1000mg three times a day for severe conditions, and then reduce as the condition improves. Nature's Own Evening Primrose Oil or Natural Nutrition Evening Primrose Oil are high quality Australian brands of EPO that may assist your condition.<p>

Other herbal products that may be of assistance include devils claw, celery, ginger, alfalfa, parsley, willow, dandelion, cranberry and feverfew. <p>

Willowbark has held a traditional place in arthritis treatment for many thousands of years - willowbark is the natural forerunner of our modern day aspirin; when combined with Devils Claw, Valerian and Feverfew, an effective formula for the relief the pain of arthritis, rheumatism, headaches, fever and muscular aches is formed. Natural Nutrition Willow Bark 3000 Plus maybe of value for those patients whose condition is moderate or where conventional drug treatment is not suitable or desired.<p>

Celery seed helps to relieve the distressing symptoms of arthritis and rheumatism, by assisting in the treatment of inflammation and dissolving uric acid crystals around the joints. Dandelion aids mild fluid retention and has a tonic effect on the liver, assisting in removing body toxins. Juniper has a diuretic effect also upon the kidneys and contains volatile oils to assist in the treatment of painful inflammation. Cranberry had been traditionally used to assist the treatment of cramps, spasm and mild inflammation. Cranberry eliminates excess acidity and may be of use as a diuretic. When these four herbs are combined, and exciting, powerful formula is created. Natural Nutrition Super Celery Complex provides a natural way to pain relief without the harmful after effects of conventional drugs. Bio-Organics Arthri-Eze combines marine oils, evening primrose oil, celery, devils claw and white willow bark to again provide an effective alternative to conventional drug treatment for the temporary relief of inflammation and pain from arthritis. MaxEPA is high in eicosopentanoic acid, an essential Omega 3 fatty acid which is required for the formation of anti-inflammatory prostaglandins in the body is a valuable supplement for the temporary relief of arthritis pain. <p>

DL-Phenylalanine is one of the eight essential amino acids (the human body is unable to synthesise its own source); and it has often been used for relieving all types of pain temporarily. It acts within the body to sustain the longer survival of our body's own natural pain killers, the endorphins, by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for their breakdown. DL-Phenylalanine is a natural amino acid and is non-addictive. Bio-Organics DL-Phenylalanine contains enhancing co-nutrients.<p>

<IMG SRC="images/h_ski_ageing_t1.gif" ALT="Ageing of the Skin" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="23" BORDER="0" VSPACE="5"><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Only about 10%-20% of skin ageing is inevitable and is due to the passing of time and gravity, combined with hereditary factors. These types of skin changes include the deepening of expression lines, thinning skin, loss of elasticity and dryness. External causes of skin ageing occur as a result of persistent abuse, poor diet, sudden weight loss, stress, alcohol, smoking, pollution, and dry weather, but the main cause of skin ageing is sun exposure. Photoageing is the main cause of wrinkles.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/melanoma7.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="122" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Photoageing or sun damage is caused by chronic sun exposure, resulting in many deeper structural as well as surface skin changes. A recent forum concluded that most (80% or so) of the visible changes we associate with ageing of the skin (the wrinkles, age spots, leathery and rough texture) are due to sun damage. By comparing our own skin in areas continually exposed to the sun such as the face or the backs of the hands with the skin on an unexposed areas of the body such as the inside forearm or buttocks, the result of solar damage is obvious.<p>

Sun damage starts in childhood, although many results may not be seen until much later. The photoaged skin develops a rough, dry, coarseness and a yellowish, wrinkled appearance. Spider type veins become visible on the face and legs and the skin becomes a mottled, blotched colour. Benign-growths, pre-cancerous growths and skin cancer may develop.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/melanoma1.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="131" HEIGHT="125" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">UV-A has been strongly implicated as a cause of photoageing. It penetrates more deeply than UV-B, and not only worsens the sunburning effect of UV-B, but damages the deeper layers of the skin. Infra-red and visible light also have damaging effects on the skin, and penetrate more deeply than UV-B and UV-A rays. Because there is no world-wide standard test for UV-A, the most valid method of determining the degree of UV-A, protection is by the formula of the sunscreen.<p>

According to recent scientific work, testing sunscreen components separately and together on humans, there is no doubt that the best UV-A protection over the entire UV-A range is provided by the combination of UV-A absorbers and a physical blocker. The ultimate sunscreen should contain a UV-B absorber, a UV-A absorber, combine UV-AB absorber and a physical blocker. The above combination of ingredients has a synergistic effect to give the best protection over the entire UV-A and UV-B spectrum. To help prevent photoageing consider the Ego Sunsense range of sunscreens for maximum protection.<p>

After exposure to the sun, use a suitable aftersun lotion or cream such as Ego Sunsense Aftersun or Ego QV Cream.<p>

<IMG SRC="images/h_ski_atopic_t1.gif" ALT="Atopic Dermatitis, Atopic Eczema, Infantile Eczema" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="456" HEIGHT="23" BORDER="0" VSPACE="5"><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="product/infantile.jpg" ALT="Infantile Eczema" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="152" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">There is an unexplained association between asthma, hay fever and atopic dermatitis or eczema, which is thought to be hereditary. The terms dermatitis and eczema mean the same for all intensive purposes. World-wide, different people use the terms slightly differently from each other. Because the skin inflammation often begins between 1 to 4 months of age, it is often called "infantile eczema". In the majority of cases, the dermatitis clears by the age of 2 to 3 years, but may recur later, at intervals.<p>

As the baby begins to crawl, thickening of the skin takes place on the knees and ankles. During childhood the dermatitis occurs mostly in the folds of the knees and elbows, sometimes around wrists and ankles or other areas. Thickening and darkening of the skin is often noticeable, but in regularly affected areas may be paler. The face and neck usually improve, but dermatitis may continue behind the ears and around the eyes. At this time, secondary infection is more common. Caution should be taken if possible to avoid infection with viruses such as herpes simplex.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/liplicker.jpg" ALT="Lip Licker" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="127" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">Atopic dermatitis is usually seen as a reddish, itching skin, or it may be oozing the cheeks, less often on the buttocks, neck or scalp. 'Lick Eczema' or peri-oral eczema is common in atopics. It may also occur in infants and young children with no known atopic history. A moist, fissured area surrounding the mouth may be due to lip-licking, thumb-sucking or dribbling. This may easily become a true 'peri-oral dermatitis' (rosacea-like dermatitis) by the use of fluorinated corticosteroids.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/atopicdermatitisflexus.jpg" ALT="Atopic Dermatitis of the Flexus" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="140" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">During adolescence, persistance in the flexures is common, especially after sweating, often induced by sport, and the face, neck and trunk are often affected. After middle age, the dermatitis usually diminishes. sometimes becoming a chronic dermatitis of the hands and feet. A few people continue to suffer throughout life. In adults, thickening of the skin may take place, often due to repeated episodes of scratching and healing.<p>

It is not unusual to see areas of skin with no sweating, probably due to blockage of the sweat ducts, which exacerbates the problem during hot and humid weather and for those participating in physical exercise. Sudden changes in temperature and emotional stress may also induce flare-ups/<p>

Involvement of the eye lids is not uncommon; in older patients dermatitis may extend to the feet  or flexural areas.<p>

A simple diagnostic test for atopic dermatitis or eczema is to press the affected skin gently but firmly, the redness temporally disappears and appears white in colour - of the skin does not show whitening, and there is no family history of atopy, then seborrhoeic dermatitis, or some other dermatitis is a more likely diagnosis.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Bed Sores is characterised by reddened or sore skin on the buttocks, heels and elbows due to continual pressure which restricts  the blood vessels and reduces the blood supply to these areas after a prolonged time in bed. Inflamed skin on the buttocks of elderly  incontinent patients and under the breast of obese patients, frequently becomes secondarily infected with the organism Candida albicans, causing 'thrush' or monilia.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/egorange.jpg" ALT="Ego Products" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="142" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">If the skin is not massaged regularly with a protective cream, a skin break may occur and extend and deepen to become a bed sore. To help treat bed sores, good nursing care and general hygeine is essential. Regular position changes, from side to side, and every 2 to 4 hours massage the areas which are under pressure to improve circulation and lessen the possibility of bed sores developing.<p>

Products to assist in bed sore prevention include Silic 15 a protective cream/lotion to hydrate dry skin and protect against urine; to cleanse the skin use QV Bar, QV Wash or QV Bath Oil as mild, effective, pH balanced and fragrance-free cleansers.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="product/chickenpox.jpg" ALT="Chicken Pox" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="148" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Chicken Pox is an acute infectious viral disease, usually occurring in children. It is characterised by intense itching and red, small blisters occurring on a reddened area of skin.<p>

The rash may take a few weeks to heal completely. The incubation period is 11-20 days. Children are generally excluded from school for 5 days after the first appearance of spots or until all spots are dry. When treating chicken pox, consider using an anti-allergy treatment, and treatment control pain and fever.<p>

It is important to relieve the intense itching, both for the comfort of the child/patient and so that no scarring and possible infection occurs from scratching. (Fingernails should be kept short and clean). Antiseptic local applications will help to prevent secondary infection. Pinetarsol is an anti-itch and anti-inflammatory cleansing solution with a pH of 6.5 reduce itching and inflammation while keeping the skin and fingernails clean. <p>

<IMG SRC="product/pinetarcol.jpg" ALT="Pinetarsol" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="142" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Pinetarsol also helps to reduce the possibility of secondary infection and scars caused by scratching. The Chicken Pox virus, like the cold sore virus uses arginine (an amino acid) as one of its major 'building blocks' - avoid this in the diet, foods such as chocolate, peanuts, vegemite, apples and almonds should be avoided.<p>

Lysine is an amino acid that slows down the progress of the virus - consider using a lysine complex, say 500mg three times a day combined with a multivitamin tonic to assist the immune system.<p>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>As many atopic dermatitis sufferers are infants, there are at least 2 patients in this case; the infant, and the mother or any other person caring for the baby. As the mother, you can be reassured and calmed by the following cheering facts;<p>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>Most babies recover by the time they are 2 or 3 years old, and that no marks or scars will remain.<p>

<LI>It is not contagious.<p>

<LI>The baby is basically healthy.
</OL><p>

<LI>As environmental factors play a big part, the following measures will assist recovery;<p>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>Overheating should be avoided; clothing should be loose and light. Avoid wool, synthetic or rough material next to the skin. Soft cotton is more suitable.<p>

<LI>It is best to avoid using soap, products containing lanolin, and highly perfumed products. Repeated rinsing of clothing, bed-linen and nappies to remove all traces of soap or washing powder is important.<p>

<LI>After bathing or showering, pat skin gently dry, do not rub.<p>

<LI>Dry skin should be treated will emollients/moisturisers.<p>

<LI>The feeling of roughness in clothing, particularly woollens or jeans, may be relieved by adding about 10ml of QV Bath Oil, which is perfume-free, lanolin-free and completely water-dispersible, to the final rinse. Especially rough clothes, eg: new jeans, should be soaked overnight before wearing.
</OL><p>

<LI>Learn to relax and remove any causes of tension, will help to prevent flare-ups of dermatitis and eczema.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/egosmallrange.jpg" ALT="Ego Products" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="146" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Products to consider include QV Bath Oil for a perfume-free, lanolin-free, water dispersible oil which gently cleanses and hydrates the skin leaving it soft and supple. Pinetarsol as a gentle anti-itch, anti-inflammatory and cleansing solution. Pinetarsol Gel for use in the shower instead of soap where skin is itching or inflamed. Egozite Ointment for babies is a mild anti-inflammatory, anti-itch and protective ointment containing ichthammol for its anti-inflammatory and anti-itch effect, zinc oxide and dimethicone for a soothing and protective effect in a soft paraffin base. Egoderm Cream for dry, inflamed skin and rashes, particularly of the hands and face. <p>

<IMG SRC="product/naturesown.jpg" ALT="Natures Own" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="200" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">It has been clinically shown that for eczema and dermatitis with a genetic link, that Evening Primrose Oil may be of assistance in treating this condition. It is thought that an enzyme responsible in the body for the manufacture of one of the ingredients in Evening Primrose Oil (GLA), may be dysfunctional, or deficient in some eczema sufferers. Hence, supplementation with GLA (gamma-Linoleic acid) may assist the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions due to its strong link to the bodies own natural anti-inflammatory prostaglandins. For adults, try 1000mg three times a day for severe eczema. To keep symptoms of dermatitis and eczema under control, try using a 15% silicone barrier cream such as Silic 15 to protect against water, soaps and other irritants.

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="product/herpessimplex.jpg" ALT="Herpes Simplex (Cold Sores)" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="149" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">Herpes Simplex (Cold Sores) is one of the most common infections of man. The virus most often affects the lips, however, other parts of the body may also be affected. The lesions usually continue to recur in the same site. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections occur in two phases. Often the primary phase is undetected and is most common in pre-school children. Symptoms include swollen gums which bleed easily and fluid filled blisters on the gums, tongue and pharynx. Blisters may also appear on lips and surrounding tissue. These blisters rupture to form white plaques and ulcers.<p>

Recurrent HSV lesions begin with tingling or itching followed by the appearance of small fluid filled blisters on reddened skin. These blisters are usually smaller than those of the primary infection and are clustered closer together. The blisters last only a few days before they become crusted. The lesions usually heal in about a week and do not usually leave scarring. Recurrent HSV lesions may be due to sunlight exposure or stress (physical stress, emotional stress, certain food or food additives, creams and lotions). To treat cold sores, consider using an antiviral agent such as povidone iodine (Betadine Cold Sore Paint) or another suitable antiviral agent such as idoxuridine. Carmex Cold Sore Balm or Nyal Cold Sore Balm relieves dry, chapped lips and relieves the discomfort of crusted, or painful cold sores.<p>

Use a suitable sunscreening lip balm when outdoors and exposed to the sun to prevent further aggravation of cold sores. Ego Sunsense Lip Balm is without doubt the most acceptable. The HSV uses arginine (an amino acid) as a major part of its self replication; if arginine is avoided in the diet, this may assist recovery; avoid chocolates, peanuts, vegemite, apples and almonds for a start. Lysine (another amino acid), is structurally similar to arginine, and can reduce the spread of HSV infections if consumed in large enough amounts. Around 1000mg three times a day in combination with Vitamin C (1000mg), Zinc and Acidophillus lactobacillus may assist and accelerate the healing of the condition.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/herpeszoster.jpg" ALT="Herpes Zoster (Shingles)" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="140" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">Herpex Zoster (Shingles) is believed to be a reinfection of the Varicella zoster virus that causes chicken pox. Evidence indicates that herpes zoster is caused by a virus similar to chicken pox. It is an acute, systemic (internal) infection which results in skin eruptions of groups of blisters on a red base with pain and itching. The blisters are typically situated on the chest wall on one side, along the line of intercostal nerves or on the face. The spinal ganglion is the principal seat of infection and the number of ganglia involved partly determines the extent of the skin eruptions.<p>

Medical attention is required for this condition - a common treatment is acyclovir, if the symptoms are recognised within the first 72 hours. Persistence of pain is common, particularly with advancing age and if the facial nerve becomes involved. In children, the eruption is usually painless but may be very itchy, with little systemic involvement. In adults, pain is often greater than the itching.<p>

The condition usually begins with pain, which is followed after 3-4 days by the formation of vesicles. These vesicles are usually situated along a nerve segment. They gradually become pustular then rupture forming crusts which fall off after 2-3 weeks. Scarring will often occur. To help relieve symptoms try using a tar based bath solution (Ego Pinetarsol) two to three times a day; use Egoderm Ointment to help soothe inflamed tissue. As mentioned an effective anti-viral treatment may be available from your doctor.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Cradle cap is due to an over-activity of the sebaceous glands. It appears as an accumulation of oily scales which form brownish, yellowish crusts on the baby's scalp. The scalp beneath the crusts is inflamed. It is relatively simple to clear up but important to do so to prevent the condition spreading and to have the baby' scalp looking as normal as possible. If there is widespread inflammation of the scalp, with greyish-white scales, it could possibly be seborrhoeic dermatitis.<p>

Egocappol is an oil based lotion that removes crusts on the infant's scalp - when treating do not forcibly remove but wait until they loosen after 3-5 days treatment.<p>

<IMG SRC="images/h_ski_dandruff_t1.gif" ALT="Dandruff" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="23" BORDER="0" VSPACE="5"><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Dandruff is an excessive flaking of the skin on the hairy area of the scalp, with some skin flakes caught amongst the hair. Shedding of surface skin cells is normal, as they are gradually replaced with cells formed at the base of the epidermis which then move towards the surface. This process takes about a month. An increase in the number of cells being shed , which tend to clump together is called dandruff.<p>

If the scalp is excessively dry, what appears to be dandruff may just be dry flaking skin. Seborrhoeic dermatitis includes severe flaking, but redness, itching and inflammation are also present. Other conditions, such as psoriasis and eczema may also affect the scalp. To treat dandruff, particularly if it is severe use Sebitar which relieves severe itching, flaking, tender and inflamed scalps while leaving the hair soft, shining and manageable.<p>

The pH of 5.5 protects the cuticle of the hair, preventing further damage to the skin. Once the condition has been brought under control, use Ego Hairscience Shampoo (For Dry, Normal or Oily Scalps) to help discourage growth of bacteria and fungi.<p>

<IMG SRC="images/h_ski_dermatitis_t1.gif" ALT="Dermatitis and Eczema" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="23" BORDER="0" VSPACE="5"><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The symptoms are an inflammation of the skin, with some swelling, redness and itching. Blistering is sometimes present. The inflammation is more often due to an irritant dermatitis, rather than a true allergic contact dermatitis. It is sometime unclear whether a dermatitis or eczema is due to exogenous causes (outside contact) or is partly due to an atopic tendency (endogenous).<p>

<IMG SRC="product/eczema.jpg" ALT="Contact Dermatitis due to rubber gloves" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="124" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">Contact Dermatitis is frequently due to contact with nickel contained in jewellery or clothing fasteners, chromate contained in cement, or chemicals in strong adhesives used for laminates and paint strippers. Skin irritation may also occur in sensitive patient to wool, lanolin, perfume, some constituents of cosmetics, nail polish, or soaps. Inflammation may also be caused by plants, particularly the rhus tree, ivy and grevilleas, and is sometimes is severe. <p>

Although these conditions have many origins, effective treatment is achieved by removing any obvious cause if possible, and treating the skin according to its present state. Itching is nearly always associated with inflammation of the skin and it is important to provide relief to break the itch-scratch cycle to improve comfort and minimise secondary infection. Inflamed skin should always be treated with gentle products to suit the inflammation rather than risk an adverse reaction by using a product which is too strong. To quote a leading dermatologist ... "Hasten slowly". It is safer to undertreat the skin rather than overtreat it. As the inflammation recedes, a gradual change may be made to a slightly stronger cream or ointment as necessary.<p>

Soap should not be used on inflamed areas of skin, as even so-called "mild" soaps are alkaline (pH 9.5-11), an may dry and irritate the skin. the skin has a slightly acid pH (5.5-6.5) and this slight acidity gives the skin its natural protection against bacteria and fungi. Soaps remove for a time this natural acid protection. As eczematous skins tend to have raised pH, they cannot easily return to an acid pH after washing with soap, and the skin may remain in a continually alkaline state and become even more vulnerable to infection and irritation.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/pinetarsol.gif" ALT="Pinetarsol Products" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="201" HEIGHT="135" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">The most effective treatment requires firstly bathing with Pinetarsol to reduce itching, reduce inflammation and cleanse the skin, followed by the application, two to three times daily of a soothing, anti-inflammatory cream or ointment. Pinetarsol has a  pH of 6.5 which will maintain the natural acid protection of the skin against bacteria and fungi and improves the effectiveness of creams and ointments. Pinetarsol Gel or Pinetarsol Bar can be used in the shower instead of supermarket brand soaps and can be easily used for the groin, genital areas, anal and other areas.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/egodermcreamrange.jpg" ALT="Egoderm Products" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="145" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">Egoderm Cream and Ointment are gentle anti-inflammatory and anti-itch preparations. The cream is an emollient preparation which is suitable for dry, cracked or fissured skin or for the face  as in cosmetic or shaving rashes. Egoderm Ointment has a more protective action and is suited to treat condition of the folds of the knees and elbows, anal and genital irritation, nappy rash, and minor cold sores. Egoderm Ointment is also useful to treat dermatitis of the feet, which can often be caused by dye leather in shoes.<p>

EgoPsoryl TA relives intense itching or pink or normal colour skin, which is less inflamed, and may be scaly or thickened due to persistant dermatitis and repeated episodes of scratching and healing. Hydrocortisone preparations may be suitable for severe inflammation - in particular, dissolved hydrocortisone - these products should only be used when recommended by your doctor or pharmacist.

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="product/sunsensefacemilk.jpg" ALT="SunSense Face Milk" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="143" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Normal skin has a smooth and glowing appearance; dry skin is dull appearance, and may be rough, scaly and prone to form open cracks. The extreme, most severe for of dry skin is called ichthyosis, also known as fish scale disease. The human skin begins to lose moisture from the moment we are born. The natural process of growing older or an inherited tendency are important causes of dry skin. In the elderly, hormonal changes in the body decrease the flow of sebum secreted by sebaceous glands of the dermis. The degree of dryness of the skin varies with age and genetic make-up, but other factors that will influence/cause skin dryness include exposure to the sun and wind (both hot and cold winds), air-conditioning, soaps and strong detergents, hot spas, hot baths and showers.<p>

 Dry skin may cause itching and be a precursor to skin conditions such as dermatitis and eczema. Many systemic medications will provoke dry skin including diuretics, nicotinic acid, antithyroid medications, clofazimine, retinol (vitamin A), somatomedin, corticosteroids and cholesterol-lowering agents.<p>

<b>To treat dry skin conditions;</b><p>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>When possible decrease exposure to hot or cold drying winds, air-conditioning, hot water, soap and strong detergents. Heated air in the home may need humidyfying.. Radiator heating should not be directed at the skin.<p>

<LI>Wool and synthetic materials may cause increased irritation.<p>

<LI>Use a bath oil, either in the bath or under the shower. Ego QV Bath Oil is suitable and a gentle cleanser for the skin.<p>

<LI>Do not use soap, use an emollient cleansing bar or liquid wash with a pH 6 to match the skin. Soaps have a pH from 9.5-11 and can dry or irritate sensitive skin. Ego QV Wash or EGO QV Bar are the most suitable for sensitive skin.<p>

<LI>Use a hydrating lotion after the shower or bath, and a cream for less extensive or very dry areas. Ego QV Lotion or Ego QV Cream.<p>

<LI>Use a moisturising sunscreen, such as SunSense Face Milk and Lip Balm, daily to help prevent the sun penetrating and drying the skin. The face and the back of the hands are particularly important as they are permanently exposed to the weather.

<BLOCKQUOTE>The skin on the face is more sensitive than most areas on the body, and facial rashes may occur easily, especially in infants. The skin appears red and flushed and minute red spots may be present. It may also be swollen, itching or feel "burning". Peri-oral dermatitis is a rash which involves the general area of the face but does not occur on the area immediately adjacent to the lips. The original condition may be made worse by a reaction to the fluorinated corticosteroid creams being applied to the face.<p>

The skin may appear inflamed or aged. Sometime the blood vessels and superficial haemorrhages are visible through the more transparent skin. 'Lick eczema' may occurr in infants or young children. A moist, fissured area surrounding the mouth may be due to lip-licking, thumb sucking or dribbling. This may become a true peri-oral dermatitis after the use of corticosteroids.<p>

To treat, discontinue any obvious preparation which may be causing the rash. Do not use soap. Apply a soothing and anti-inflammatory preparation according to the condition of the skin. For itching, and inflammation, try Pinetarsol as it gently cleanses and the pH of 6.5 maintains the natural acid protection of the skin against bacteria and fungi. For severe cases, add 10ml to a basin of iced water and bathe the affected area.  Ego QV Wash is a soap alternative in a liquid form that is perfume-free, lanolin-free for sensitive skin areas. Like Pinetarsol it has a pH of around 6. QV Bar is a cleansing bar containing one-third emollients for dry, sensitive areas.<p>

For particularly inflamed conditions, apply Egoderm Cream which is an anti-inflammatory, anti-itch and emollient cream which is easily absorbed and unnoticeable on the skin. Relieves dry, inflamed, itchy rashes, peri-oral dermatitis, cosmetic allergy, collar rash and shaving rash.<p>

They are caused by many different types fungi - a table of  the varying groups and the conditions they cause is given below.<p>

Fungi may spread from one area of the body to another and may originate from an infected cat or dog, (which will also need treatment if this is the case), and from contact with other people directly or indirectly. Tinea may be picked up from wet floors in public showers. People who perspire freely or have their hands frequently in water are more often affected, as fungi grow in moist, warm conditions.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is important to note that, as bacteria are nearly always associated with fungal infections, the anti-fungal product used should also be anti-bacterial. It should also be effective against the organism Candida albicans which frequently causes a super-imposed monilial or thrush infection in warm, moist areas, where inflammation is already present, such as in the groin, the vulvovaginal area or under the breasts.<p>

<IMG SRC="product/qvsoaps.jpg" ALT="QV Soaps" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="144" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Candida albicans may also be present if the skin is soggy and macerated between the toes or fingers. To ensure that the fungal infection is completely and effectively treated and to help prevent recurrence it important to continue the treatment for at least 5 days after the initial symptoms have disappeared. Soap should be avoided as it may cause further irritation to the skin - choose a soap alternative such as Ego QV Wash or Pinetarsol if the area is itchy, inflamed and irritated.<p>

Careful drying of the skin and early treatment of the condition to prevent its spread to other areas is essential. The wearing of airy, absorbent clothing, light open shoes or sandals and the avoidance of overheating, rubber-soled shoes and synthetic socks will also help. There are several anti-fungal treatments which include miconazole nitrate, tolnaftate and clotrimazole - of these miconazole is the most effective as it has an antibacterial action in addition to its anti-fungal effects.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In hives (urticaria) the superficial blood vessels are the seat of response and the substance reaching them and causing the reaction are, in most cases, distributed by the blood stream. Small blood vessels dilate due to the release of histamine by nearby cells. The skin reaction appears as pale lumps or wheals, sometimes surrounded by reddish skin.<p>

They may appear anywhere on the body, and are extremely itchy. They are frequently caused by an allergic reaction to particular foods such as fish, cheese, nuts, chocolate, strawberries, or to a particular medication. A frequent sufferer may benefit by noting which foods or medications precede an eruption. The duration of wheals is extremely  variable, lasting from minutes or hours to days, months or years. Spontaneous remission may occur.<p>

Acute forms may be self-limiting, while cases recurring over time may be kept relatively free from discomfort by proper treatment. Occasionally there is associated respiratory difficulty. Any severe condition needs medical attention.  Pinetarsol is an anti-itch, anti-inflammatory and cleansing solution for use in a bath or diluted as a wash; use Egoderm Cream or Ointment after cleansing.<p>

An antihistamine medication may be necesary for moderate to severe conditions - remembering that antihistamines may not be acceptable to take if you are operating machinery/or driving, are taking medication for glaucoma or taking other medication with anti-cholinergic effects. Why not E-mail our pharmacists for further information.<p>

Insect Bites are caused by a variety of mites, fleas, ticks or other insects and are often on children. They may occurr as recurrent bouts of groups of large, red spots often with a vesicle/blister on top. These occur mostly under the clothing or may be on the exposed surfaces from flying insects. They are intensely itchy. Insect bites from mosquito's, fleas or other insects cause erythrema and oedema at the site of the bite.<p>

The damaged skin is susceptible to infection especially if the itch is not controlled and scratching continues. Secondary infection is common and, if present, should be treated. To treat insect bites - relieving the symptoms by using an anaesthetic like lignocaine may be accetpable, also application of cold sensation provide by menthol containing products may also be useful. Apply cold. Haemamelis is also extremely useful for mosquito bites - Stop Itch contains Haemamelis in an easy to apply Lotion.<p>

To avoid bites from mosquito's and other such insects, use Rid Insect Repellant.<p>

<IMG SRC="images/h_ski_linotar_t1.gif" ALT="Linotar For the Relief of Symptoms" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="23" BORDER="0" VSPACE="5"><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Linotar Gel combines the active Coal Tar in a base of Essential Fatty Acids, which were first identified by the developer of this treatment, in banana skins.<p>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Choosing the Right Linotar Kit.</H3> <p>

The five basic items required to get started are:<p>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Linotar Gel 1, 2, or 3.
<LI>Linotar PSE Cream
<LI>Linotar Lotion
<LI>Soap
<LI>Shampoo
</UL><p>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>A. Choosing the Appropriate Linotar Gel.</H4><p>

There are three different Linotar Gels, varying in coal tar content - 1%, 2% and 3%, while these percentages appear to vary only marginally, the difference is considerable and it is important not to use a stronger gel than is appropriate to your circumstances.<p>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#FF0000">CAUTION: If you are allergic to Coal Tar, STOP TREATMENT.</FONT><p>

If too strong a gel is used, it may retard the remission process considerably and lesions could become severely inflamed. Gel strength is selected on Age, Skin Condition and Position of lesions.</CENTER><p>

<b>Age</b><p>

As a general rule we reccomend that sufferers under 7 years and over 60 years commence with Linotar 1. Between these ages start with Linotar 2 unless otherwise instructed below.<p>

<b>Skin Condition</b><p>

If the skin is badly damaged, tender to the touch, or where a sufferer is considered to have very sensitive skin such as a young child or baby, start with Linotar 1 and where necessary, diluted in 2,3 or 4 parts or more, with Aqueous Cream BP or purified water to one part Gel.<p>

<b>Position of Lesions</b><p>

Linotar 1 is recommended to be applied to lesions in the following areas; scalp, face, fingernails, palms of the hand, under the arms, groin, genitalia and anal area (external only), navel, on or around the breasts or around the feet.<p>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>B. Linotar PSE Cream</H4><p>

Linotar Gel has been specially formulated to be as oil and fat free as possible in order to enable it to penetrate deeply into the skin. Consequently, it will be inclined to dry out the skin even more. Therefore, for optimum treatment, it is suggested that you use a moisturising cream over the Gel, and for this purpose, Linotar PSE Cream for the body is most appropriate.<p>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>C. Linotar Lotion</H4><p>

The scalp and face will also require a moisturiser. Linotar Lotion is specially formulated for the face and the scalp and should be used after treatment with Linotar Gel.<p>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>D. Choosing the Correct Soap and Shampoo.</H4><p>

Due to the rapid movement of skincells in a psoriatic lesion from the basal layer where cells are created, up to the surface, the upper cells are not able to fulfill their vital protective function. Lesions are therefore extremely susceptible to allergens and strong chemicals. Consider this when selecting your soap and shampoo. They should preferably by hypo-allergenic and no contain any colourants, fragrances or detergents. Suitable cleansers include Ego QV Bar, Ego QV Wash, and Ego Hair Science Shampoos and Conditioners. The Ego range of cleansers and shampoos are also pH balanced to maintain the natural acidic protective layer of the skin reducing infection from micro-organisms.<p>

<b>How to Use the Linotar Psoriasis Treatment.</b><p>

Remembering that Linotar Gel was purposely designed to be as oil and fat free as possible to enhance penetration, it is necessary that you cleanse the area with a suitable cleanser.<p>

<b>For the Body</b><p>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>Apply a thin layer of the appropriate strength Linotar Gel (diluted where necessary). Wait for the Gel to dry - as a general guideline, if Linotar Gel hasn't dried within 2 minutes, too much as been used.<p>

<LI>Next apply a thinly layer of Linotar PSE cream.<p>

<LI>Repeat two or three times a day as your personal circumstances allow.
</OL><p>

<b>For the Face & Scalp</b><p>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>Apply  a thin layer of Linotar Gel 1, diluted where necesary, to every affected area. For the head, you do not need to rub the Linotar Gel through the hair but only apply it directly to the lesions on the scalp. Allow the gel to dry, if it has not dried within 2 minutes, you have used too much.<p>

<LI>Apply a thin layer of Linotar Lotion over the Gel.<p>

<LI>Repeat the application of the Gel and Lotion two or three times a day as your personal circumstances allow.
</OL><p>

<FONT SIZE="2"><B>NOTE:</B> Whenever lesions become dry between applications of Linotar Gel and Cream/Lotion - reapply the Lotion/Cream as an adjunct to your therapy keeping lesions soft and supple.</FONT><p>

<IMG SRC="images/h_ski_nappy_t1.gif" ALT="Nappy Rash" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="111" HEIGHT="23" BORDER="0" VSPACE="5"><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Napkin rash is a type of contact dermatitis, occurring in infant. The most common form of napkin dermatitis usually appears as erythema (redness) of the skin in closest contact with the napkin. It is due to sensitivity of the patients skin to a chemical formed by the breakdown of the urine in the napkin. <p>

It can be aggravated (but not caused) by prolonged contact with wet napkins, the occlusive effect of plastic pants, sensitivity to soap or detergents used in washing napkins, or to substances used for local treatment. The deeper part of the flexures are normally spared.<p>

The eruption usually has the appearance  of a burn, initially it may be only red, but blisters may occur. Rashes in the napkin area can become secondarily infected with Candida. the skin will usually be red and inflamed. Candida can be diagnosed by the appearance of small white pustules around the edges of the rash.<p>

Treatment involves ensuring the baby is as comfortable as possible and the application of topical anti-inflammatory treatments. If Candida albicans is present, a topical antifungal such as miconazole needs to be applied.<p>

<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>Change napkins immediately when wet or soiled.<p>

<LI>If any diarrhoea is present, and the baby is not being breast-fed, check the diet with the Maternal & Child Health Centre Sister or contact one of our pharmacists.<p>

<LI>Ensure that napkins are rinsed well to remove any detergent or antiseptic residues.<p>

<LI>Thoroughly cleanse the napkin area at every change using Ego QV Wash instead of supermarket brand soaps. Supermarket brand soaps may aggravate the condition.<p>

<LI>Use an emollient barrier treatment at every napkin change to help prevent reoccurrence. Ego Silic 15 is one of the superior brands of barrier cream.<p>

<LI>Allow the baby some time out of the nappy each day.<p>

<LI>Apply a suitable anti-fungal treatment where necessary. Consult one of our pharmacists for advice.

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="product/pinetarcol.jpg" ALT="Pinetarsol" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="142" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Pruritis during pregnancy is fairly common. It is often generalised and the skin appears normal except for excoriations. The pruritis may be  due to cholestasis. The symptoms usually disappear on delivery. Treatment involves relieving symptoms.<p>

Avoid scratching which sets up the itch-scratch cycle and may lead to damaged skin. Avoid soap as it may remove the sebum and dry the skin, exacerbating the pruritis. After bathing the skin should be patted dry on a soft towel, not rubbed, so as to avoid irritation. Pinetarsol is available as a bath oil which helps to reduce inflammation and itching rapidly.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="product/psoriasiaface.jpg" ALT="Psoriasis on the Face" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="202" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">Psoriasis is a disease which most often manifests itself as red, inflamed, raised swollen lesions covered with silvery scales (like fish scales hence the latin Psor...) and crusts of varying thickness on the skin and it affects around 2% of the American population. These lesions are most commonly seen on the extensor surface of the elbows, knees, buttock crease and scalp. Psoriasis of the scalp can result in hair loss.<p>

There are many forms of psoriasis including common or plaque-type, flexural, guttate, pustular, erythrodermic and psoriasis of the nails. It is a chronic rash that may "come and go", but usually does not disappear - the unpredictability of the rash makes it more difficult to treat. <p>

<IMG SRC="product/psoriesia.jpg" ALT="Psoriasis on the Napkin Area" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="147" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">The cause of psoriasis is unknown and it is an area that continues to be researched, there are indications that there may be a strong genetic link. We refer to triggers rather than causes of psoriasis, as it seems that the right climate must exist for psoriasis to develop. This climate, we believe, has to do with the state of the body's immune system which can be weakened by things like infection, stress hormones, alcohol, high cholesterol and blood sugar levels, incorrect eating habits, certain drugs etc.<p>

It is important to note that in weakening the immune system the body's defences are rendered vulnerable. What is common is all psoriasis sufferers is that the turnover time for the epidermis (upper skin layer) is around 2 days compared with 14 days for a normal patient and that psoriasis cells reproduce every 36 hours compared with around 311 for a normal cell. It is also known that the amino acid tryptophan is essential to the proliferation of psoriasis.<p>

The basis for most psoriasis therapies is to interfere with the proliferative process and to impede the excessive and rapid rate of cell production. Treatment is generally with topical lotions (EgoPsoryl Gel), shampoos (Polytar Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Gel, Neutrogena T/Sal, Ego Sebitar), keratolytics (salicyclic acid) coal tar preparations such as the new Linotar range, corticosteroid creams like Cortaid Cream or Sigmacort, while methotrexate and ultraviolet light treatment (PUVA using oxsoralen), systemic corticosteroids and retinoids are used in more severe/advanced conditions.<p>

It is known that the abnormal cells of psoriasis require tryptophan for their production. If they are starved of this, the psoriasis regresses. The body cannot make tryptophan (an essential amino acid), as such it has to obtain it from the food which is eaten. A diet containing no tryptophan would therefore cause complete resolution of the psoriasis-scaling within 10 days. Unfortunately, such a diet is hard to achieve and even harder to adhere to. Also, other cells in the body would be affected - but a general avoidance will however improve your condition markedly.<p>

<b>Group 1</b><p>

The Following contain no tryptophan and may be eaten freely. Apples, beer, butter, celery, coffee, carbonated drinks, gelatin, grapes, honey, lard, margarine, mushrooms, olive oil, peppers, pineapple, pumpkin, rhubarb, rum, sugar, syrup, tea, whisky.<p>

<b>Group 2</b><p>

The group contains tryptophan, but in only small amount, so no great effort should be made to avoid them. Asparagus, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, corn-starch, condensed milk, cream, cucumber, grapefruit, lettuce, melons, onions, oranges, peaches, pears, peas, radish, rice, sprouts, strawberries, tapioca, tomatoes.<p>

<b>Group 3</b><p>

The following contain a fair amount of tryptophan, and should be avoided where possible. Bananas, beans, beetroot, blackberries, cherries, currants, dates, figs, milk, oatmeal, potatoes, prunes, raisins, spinach.<p>

<b>Group 4</b><p>

The following are high in tryptophan content and on a strict diet are forbidden, however, since they are an important part of our food, it may be necessary for some to be eaten. East as little as possible of bread, cheese, fish, flour, icecream, meat including heart, kidney, liver. White meat contains less tryptophan than red and of all meats, turkey contains the least.<p>

<b>Group 5</b>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE="5">The Following Foods Should Be Avoided.</FONT><p>

BARLEY, CHOCOLATE, COCOA, EGGS, MACARONI, NUTS, SCALLOPS, SPAGHETTI.</CENTER>
<HR>
This overall diet is basically a low protein diet and is not that hard to adhere to. We'd love you to E-mail us your "psoriasis friendly" recipes to <a href="mailto:amcal@iinet.net.au">amcal@iinet.net.au</a>.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a common dermatitis with a characteristic distribution. It appears in areas where sebaceous glands are numerous such as the face, extending downwards to the neck and behind the ears, the scalp, central chest and between the shoulder blades. The flexures may also be affected, particularly the axillae, the submammary regions and the ano-genital region. The sebaceous glands are active at birth, but when stimulation by maternal hormones ceases, they become inactive for 9 to 12 years. <IMG SRC="product/seborrhoeicdermatitisbaby.jpg" ALT="Seborrhoeic Dermatitis on the napkin area" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="137" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">Seborrhoeic dermatits during infancy is normally confined to the first months of life. Most commonly, seborrhoeic dermatitis occurs between the ages of 18-40. Occasionally cases are seen in old age. At all ages, seborrhoeic dermatitis is more common in males than females.<p>

<b>Seborrhoeic dermatitis may appear as the following variations:</b><p>

<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>a scaly, reddened eruption on the scalp, forehead, eyebrows, base of the nose, on the chest or pubic region, or,<p>

<LI>a moist fissured eruption which may appear in flexural areas.
</OL><p>

On the scalp, seborrhoeic dermatitis usually begins as red spots covered with greasy, yellowish scales, which frequently spread and increase in size. The patient complains of itchiness, discomfort and sometime loss of hair. It may spread downwards to involve the ears and neck, or forward to involve the forehead. Eyelids may also be affected.  The flexural type of sebborrhoeic dermatitis may appear as moist, red, scaly persistant areas under the breasts, between the buttocks, in the armpit, the groin or umbilicus. Behind the ears, scales may accumulate and fissuring occur. <p>

It is currently thought that, Pitryosporum, a yeast organism, is the causative agent in seborrhoeic dermatitis - the way in which this organism induces inflammation and desquammation (skin loss) is not clear, although it is known that Pityrosproum can activate immune responses and this may play some role. Treatment of sebborhoeic dermatitis is based around reducing inflammation while also reducing yeast infestations as much as possible.<p>

Wash the hair with a pH balanced, tar based shampoo such as Sebitar - it is a cleansing treatment for dandruff, itching/flaking scalps and sebborhoea which reduces inflammation and iritation of the scalp.<p>

<IMG SRC="images/h_vit_amino_t1.gif" ALT="Amino Acids - Food for Thought?" WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="23" BORDER="0" VSPACE="5"><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Our brain is an incredible organ. It contains a storehouse of information that is essential to life itself. Commands are constantly received and transmitted to and from the brain through a complex network of nerves and impulses. From acts of thought and logic, to the mechanics of muscle contraction and sleep, this magnificent relayer of knowledge and bodily messages is reliant on various nutrients to function at its best. Several amino acids are important in fueling the brain, keeping it active and alert, increasing mental concentration and memory recall, and ensuring the messages relayed through the neurotransmitters are passed swiftly and accurately. The most important amino acids include L-Glutamine, DL-Phenylalanine, and L-Tyrosine.<p>

<b>L-Glutamine</b><p>

Often referred to as "brain fuel", L-Glutamine is an amino acid found in all protein foods. Its importance to the human body cannot be underestimated, as it is one of the few substances that is able to cross the blood-brain barrier - once L-Glutamine has made its successful journey into the brain, it is converted to glutamic acid.  Glutamic acid is said to perform two main tasks inside the brain. Firstly it is thought to act as kindling to brain activity, igniting mind power and providing extra energy, vigour and a feeling of well being. The second task of Glutamic acid is to act as a buffer against the accumulation of excess ammonia in the brain. Ammonia, one of natures most poisonous chemicals, is a by-product of protein metabolism, a natural process occurring continually within the human body. Too much of this toxic substance may cause some damage to the brain and never allow it to function at its true potential. L-Glutamine may be useful then to those suffering from mental fatigue, depression, learning disabilities, mental deficiencies in children, and in some cases of schizophrenia and epilepsy. 
Students have found this amino acid beneficial during examination time when the brain is subject to a grueling workload. L-Glutamine may successfully increase energy to the brain thereby enhancing concentration for homework and revision, and helping to provide more clarity and alertness during pressuring exams.<p>

Further benefits of L-Glutamine include experiments by Dr.William Shive at the University of Texas, where he has consequently discovered that L-Glutamine protected rats against alcohol poisoning - other scientists have observed that L-Glutamine may actually curb alcohol craving and sugar cravings. As an aid in the treatment of peptic ulcers, L-Glutamine may be extremely beneficial - Dr.Shive (mentioned above) has isolated L-Glutamine from cabbage leaves and found it assists in the healing process of the digestive enzyme membrane, thereby shortening the healing time for this condition considerably.<p>

L-Glutamine is a safe, natural food substance, with many benefits to the human form.<p>

<b>L-Tyrosine and DL-Phenylalanine to Overcome Depression.</b><p>

In the body, L-Tyrosine (LT) and DL-Phenylalanine (DLP) act as forerunners to certain natural compounds known as neurotransmitters, which control the basic process of nerve impulse transmission between cells. These determiners of our mental and emotional well-being are said to be responsible for positive mental attitude, alertness and ambition. they include noradrenaline and adrenaline. Because L-Tyrosine and DL-Phenylalanine are both involved in the metabolic pathway that leads to the production of neurotransmitters they are often found together in a supplemental form. As a natural therapeutic acid, the amino acids LT and DLP may prove to be a very real alternative to habit forming drugs which are often prescribed for depression and stress related anxiety. A study carried out by Dr Alan Gelenberg of the Harvard Medical School showed clearly that a lack of L-Tyrosine resulted in a deficiency of the hormone noradrenaline, at a certain location in the brain where it relates specifically to mood problems such as depression.<p>

Antidepressant drugs rely on manipulating an increase in noradrenaline and adrenaline to elevate moods. Unfortunately the neurotransmitters are then dispersed instead of being reabsorbed as would naturally occur. Eventually this may lead to depletion of these vital constituents. This may mean the original depression is only aggravated. Normalising the levels of neurotransmitters by taking a more natural approach would therefore seem to be a more desirable process for treating depression.<p>

<b>Improving Memory and Mental Alertness</b><p>

Most of us at some time or another have suffered from some type of memory loss. It may be the inability to recall a person's name, the title of a book or movie, or whether you'd carried out as simple a task as closing a window. These types of memory loss can be the source of much frustration and stress. There are other more serious and distressing types of memory loss though that may leave the bearers with little awareness of who or even where they are. Continued use of L-Tyrosine may result in improved memory and mental alertness. It might also be useful in problems associated with high blood pressure, sleep disturbances, allergies, and to assist in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.<p>

<b>L-Tyrosine/DL-Phenylalanine and Weight Loss</b><p>

L-Tyrosine is reported to help those on weight loss programmes. Its participation in several glandular functions may be important in controlling appetite and speeding up metabolism, thereby creating extra energy, burning up unwanted fat and stimulating muscle growth. L-Tyrosine has a close link with the function of the thyroid gland - when taken with Kelp which is high in Iodine, optimum effect is attained. DL-Phenylalanine is also well known for its possible action in stimulating the release of CCK, a hormone which functions as an appetite suppressant. DLP can help create a feeling of satiety which reduces the desire for eating large meals. The decreased intake of food naturally assists with weight loss.<p>

<b>DL-Phenylalanine and Relieving Pain Naturally</b><p>

DL-Phenylalanine may also be beneficial in naturally relieving some types of chronic pain. Our own natural built in pain relief system is based in the brain. The brain produces many hormone like chemicals that form a close resemblance to morphine. When pain signals are delivered to the brain the release of these chemicals, known as Endorphins, is triggered. They then travel to the traumatised part of the body. DLP extends the lifespan in the nervous system, of naturally occurring Endorphins, by reducing the effectiveness of enzymes that would normally breakdown these natural analgesics. Results for conditions such as lower back pain normally occur within 24-48 hours with no harmful side effects.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>Relieving The Winter Ills With Odourless Garlic</b><p>

Many traditional remedies, once dismissed as pure folklore, are gaining new respectability in the light of recent scientific research.  One of the natural remedies that has received the most attention is the herb Garlic, which has been shown to have a number of beneficial effects.<p>

Generally, garlic is valuable for the temporary relief of many minor ailments.
Garlic has been used for thousands of years to help relieve the symptoms of colds and flu.
Garlic is an expectorant, which means it helps to break up congested mucous so that is can be coughed or sneezed out of the system.
Garlic is also helpful in relieving fever because it tends to increase perspiration and promote thirst.
Probably the most important action of garlic is its antibacterial properties which seem to fight minor respiratory infection itself.<p>

<b>Bio-Organics Arizona</b><p>

<B>Odourless Garlic</B> contains 500mg of high potency odourless garlic in two piece hardshell capsules.  Due to a patented process, <B>Bio-Organics Arizona Odourless Garlic</B> has not had the chemical structure of its active constituents Allicin or selenium altered.  The cold temperature blending process of <B>Bio-Organics Arizona Odourless Garlic</B> allows the retention of all the nutrients including allicin, yet eliminates the unpleasant odour.  This process for deodorising garlic uses citrus extracts to buffer the odorous sulphides in garlic.  Since this method is relatively simple, unlike the ageing process used by some manufacturers, Bio-Organics guarantee the highest quality synergistic formulas. For added health benefits consider these quality supplements from the Bio-Organics range.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>Nature's Colourful Healer</b><p>

<b>What is Betacarotene?</b><p>

Betacarotene is a natural food substance found in red, yellow and orange fruit and vegetables.  As an important member of the carotenoid family and a precursor to Vitamin A in the human body, it may offer some incredible life preserving benefits. Such may be the powerful antioxidant effects of betacarotene that it has become the subject of numerous studies and trials around the world.  Especially in the areas of heart disease and cancer. Reports exploding with favourable data are now surfacing from some of these studies.<p>

<b>Natural Protection Against Heart Disease</b><p>

Dr. Phillip Gaffney, a senior scientist at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, discovered that patients supplemented with betacarotene, reported significant increases in HDL levels.  (HDL being the good form of cholesterol that helps reduce the risk of coronary heart disease). In another study involving 22,000 male doctors, it was found that those supplementing with betacarotene showed significantly less chance of heart attack and stroke than those who were not.<p>

<b>Betacarotene and Cancer</b><p>

Cancers are caused by mutations or abnormal changes in the DNA of the cells.  These changes may be triggered by viruses, pollution, lowered resistance or even genetic factors which may lay dormant until triggered by environmental conditions.  These mutations may begin in one cell or in a group of  cells.  eventually the cells multiply until they form large areas of diseased tissue.  After a time the cancerous cells may begin to spread throughout the body via the lymph system or the bloodstream where they may then form secondary cancers in other parts of the body. Many cancers, such as lung cancer, are undetectable because they are internal and so they cannot be seen or felt.  Much of the research into Betacarotene in relation to cancer has been as a preventative measure.  Cancers which have shown a marked reaction to Betacarotene include those that affect the epithelial tissues, the mucous membrane linings of the inner body, such as the digestive and respiratory tracts.  Lung cancer in particular has been linked conclusively with low levels of betacarotene in the bloodstream.  Studies have shown Betacarotene provides a protective effect to mucous membrane linings, from pollutive elements such as cigarette smoke, car exhaust fumes, industrial chemicals etc.  This may be a good indicator to smokers to step up their intake of the valuable nutrient.<p>

<b>Antioxidant Power</b><p>

Betacarotene is a powerful antioxidant.  As such it protects the cells against the onslaught of damaging free radicals.  Free radicals are unstable molecules that float freely throughout the body seeking out normal healthy cells to use to rebalance themselves.  Free radical damage may be responsible for a dangerous chain reaction that could possibly result in chronic diseases.  Betacarotene may also be useful to the immune system, in preventing some of the effects of ageing, and in the treatment of acne and other skin disorders.<p>

<b>But just how does betacarotene work?</b><p>

As a carotenoid betacarotene is able to be converted in the body into Vitamin A, an important vitamin necessary for growth, healthy eyes, skin and mucous membranes, tooth and bone development, healthy tissues and reproduction ability.  However, Vitamin A in large doses over a prolonged period of time can be toxic, as it accumulates in the fatty tissues of the body.<p>

<b>Double the value</b><p>

The remarkable value of betacarotene is that it will only convert to vitamin A as the body requires it.  This controlled conversion ensures its safety and non-toxicity as a source of Vitamin A.  The unwanted betacarotene circulates through the body's blood plasma and is stored in tissues.  There it may play an invaluable role as an antioxidant, slowing down the aging process and protecting cells against the harmful free radical damage that comes from the environment in the forms of pollution, cigarette smoke and other toxins.  This 'excess' betacarotene might also be helpful in stimulating the immune system to kill off tumour cells and to attack other viruses and infections. Betacarotene is nature's colourful healer.  It appears to offer us immense and valuable protection against some of the era's most damaging health problems.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>"WHEN YOU'RE GREEN INSIDE, YOU'RE CLEAN INSIDE"</b><p>

Chlorella is known as the 'Jewel of the Orient' because of its high concentrations of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, protein and enzymes.<p>

The most unusual thing about chlorella is its inherent strength through a genetic structure that has remained unchanged for over two billion years.<p>

<b>The Chlorophyll Factor</b><p>

Chlorella is an algae grown in ponds rich in mineral salts and is well-known for its cleansing and healing actions, due to its high level of nutrients and chlorophyll.  Just as haemoglobin is the vital substance in human red blood cells, chlorophyll is similar in chemical composition and is an essential component of plants.  Chlorophyll is responsible for transforming carbon dioxide in the air to oxygen and it uses the energy of the sun to manufacture nourishment for the plant.<p>

All life depends upon energy, and nearly all our energy comes from the sun.  It is believed that green vegetables carry a concentrated sun energy that can be assimilated and released into the cell structure of the body, cleansing the body of toxins, energising the immune system, strengthening cell membranes and boosting natural energy.  There is from 10 to 100 more times the chlorophyll in Chlorella as there is in leafy green vegetables.<p>

<b>Other Important Nutrients</b><p>

Chlorella is particularly rich in iron, zinc and other minerals, and the concentration of Vitamin A  is also much higher than that found in green vegetables.  Vitamin A, a potent antioxidant, is a significant factor in cholera's ability to strengthen the immune system and is necessary for healthy body tissues.<p>

<b>Detoxifying the Body</b><p>

Research has shown that the cellulose wall of Chlorella attaches to heavy metals in the digestive tract and removes them from the body.  Chlorella strengthens and protects the liver and immune system, further aiding in detoxifying the bloodstream and tissues of harmful chemical substances.  Many Japanese have been taking Chlorella for years to protect themselves from pollution.<p>

<b>Healing From Within</b><p>

Chlorella has been shown to be therapeutic in the following ways:<p>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Strengthening our immune system.
<LI>Accelerating the healing of wounds, injuries and ulcers.
<LI>Providing protection against toxic pollutants and radiation.
<LI>Normalising digestion and bowel function.
<LI>Stimulation growth and repair to tissues.
<LI>Retarding aging.
</UL><p>

It is also believed that once the body tissues are cleansed and renewed, the body is able to repair and rebuild itself, thus preventing or minimising the duration of illness, particularly those of a more serious nature, such as liver disease or problems associated with toxicity.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Healthy people radiate a special kind of beauty. Their well-being is often reflected in shiny hair, clear skin, and strong healthy nails, bones and teeth. It is a kind of beauty that cannot be obtained through a profusion of cosmetic creams, lotions or hair conditioners. Fresh, natural beauty comes from within. So if you want to put the sheen back into your hair, or have strong healthy nails and clear skin, you may need to ensure your body receives a plentiful supply of nutrients.<p>

Equisteum has often been referred to as the "beauty herb" because of its high Silica content. the levels of this important mineral are especially abundant in the springtime harvest. Silica is a mineral vital to the formation of collagen, the substance that holds the cells together. It is also found in bones, teeth, skin, eyes, glands and organs such as the liver, heart and muscles. A deficiency in Silica may lead to dull lifeless hair, brittle nails, loose sagging skin and premature wrinkles.<p>

Silica also plays and important role in assisting Calcium in maintaining the hardness of bone, and in increasing collagen for bone flexibility. Studies show fractured bones heal faster when Equisetum is used as a supplement. Calcium nodules and spurs also respond well to treatment with this silica rich Herb. Equisetum (or Horsetail) has also been used to assist in wound healing to promote suppuration and initiate the discharge of waste. When treating wounds and lesions such as abscesses and boils, try first using Ferrum Phosphate and Potassium Chloride in the initial stages followed by a silicon oxide (silica) supplement. It is also used in repairing ligament, cartilage and tendon damage and as a mild diuretic.<p>

Natural Nutrition Mega Potency Equisetum 2000 is a potent supplement derived from the best springtime European Equisetum extract, blister packed for your convenience. <p>

<b>An Important Part Of Folk Medicine</b><p>

Evening Primrose, the humble herb often hailed as 'Nature's Healer', has a history as colourful as its characteristic, bright yellow flower.  It began its existence in Central America 70,000 years ago.  For centuries, ancient American Indians used its roots and leaves for wound healing and for treating respiratory problems.  In 1619 it became known as 'King's cure-all' and formed an important part of folk medicine thereafter. Today the Evening Primrose is famous more for the rich oil extracted from seeds than for its roots and leaves.<p>

<b>Pro-Modern Science 'Rediscovers' Evening Primrose Oil</b><p>

Over the past thirty years the many reported benefits of Evening Primrose Oil (EPO), have been the subject of rigorous testing in hospitals and universities all over the world.  Time and again its medicinal properties are being proven in clinical studies and controlled experiments.  Most recently in the U.K. it survived the tough scrutiny of the drug regulatory authorities.  It  was proclaimed safe and effective.<p>

<b>How Does It Work?</b><p>

EPO contains linolenic acid (LA) and gamma linolenic acid (GLA), essential ingredients in the vital production of prostaglandins within the human body.  Prostaglandins are hormone like compounds.  They are in constant use throughout the body, controlling the way we feel. and rejuvenating cells.  Prostaglandins cannot be stored -  they need to be replenished regularly. However the process of prostaglandin production can be blocked or seriously slowed down by the lifestyle and diet of the modern world.  Factors such as ageing, high cholesterol, stress, high alcohol intake, diabetes, saturated fats, refined carbohydrates and viral infections may result in prostaglandin deficiency.  The high GLA content in EPO may be the answer to ensuring prostaglandin production remains at its peak.<p>

<b>Natural Relief From PMT</b><p>

They symptoms of pre-menstrual tension do not only mean tension and irritability.  Cramps, depression, breast pain, bloating, headaches, and sugar cravings are real problems for many women each month.  Dr. David Horrobin, a scientist at the forefront of EPO research, reported that a group of women clinically tested at the St. Thomas hospital medical school in the UK overwhelmingly declared the success of EPO in the treatment of severe symptoms of PMT.  What is most interesting is that the majority of women tested had not responded to ordinary drug treatments.<p>

<b>EPO And Arthritis</b><p>

The anti-inflammatory properties of EPO may be of great assistance to those afflicted by rheumatoid arthritis and may even lead to a reduction in the need for prescribed drugs.  In one placebo controlled experiment involving arthritis sufferers, 94% of those taking Evening Primrose Oil supplements reported their pain and inflammation had diminished.  Of those taking the placebo, 67% said they felt no better and in some cases even felt worse.<p>

<b>Reducing The Risk Of Heart Disease</b><p>

EPO is also reputed to assist in circulation, high blood pressure, the reduction of cholesterol and the maintenance of healthy arteries.  All major factors in the prevention of heart disease.  Again it is the GLA content of the oil that is thought to be responsible.  Modern Western lifestyle habits such as smoking, dietary errors and lack of exercise may lead to a reduction of prostaglandins which are needed to maintain a normal healthy cardio-vascular system.  The addition of GLA rich Primrose Oil may reduce the tendency of blood to clot abnormally and may also effectively reduce cholesterol.<p>

<b>Further Benefits</b><p>

Multiple Sclerosis - Some multiple sclerosis patients report that EPO helps to relieve some of the distressing symptoms of the disease and may even reduce the severity and frequency of relapses.  <p>

<B>AIDS</B> - Regular use of EPO  might also assist AIDS  suffers, with the alleviation of skin sores and fatigue being among reported benefits. <p>

<B>Weight Control</B> - In some cases of obesity EPO may help by stimulating brown fat tissue to burn up calories and rectify metabolic abnormalities. <p>

<B>Alcohol</B> - One medical study reported favourable results for alcoholics, in improving withdrawal symptoms.  EPO may also prevent hang overs when taken after drinking as it is thought to alter the way in which alcohol is metabolised in the liver.<p>

Evening Primrose Oil is a natural nutritional supplement with superb benefits and no harmful side effects.  A general tonic for the better health and well-being of everyone.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Ginkgo Biloba tree has flourished for more than 200 million years. Its survival over time has been attributed to its peculiar resistance to insects, pollution and disease. Chinese monks so revered the Ginkgo Biloba tree that they cultivated it in their temple gardens. The therapeutic value of Ginkgo leaves has been known to the Chinese for more than 5,000 years - traditionally physicians prescribed it for relieving the symptoms of asthma, bronchial coughs and chilblains.<p>

In today's natural medicine, uses for Ginkgo are more varied - it is often prescribed for the improvement of peripheral circulation, so may be of immense benefit to people suffering from pains in the legs during exercise, stiffness in the shoulders and extreme coldness in the hands and feet. Ginkgo Biloba may also relieve the annoying ringing in the ears associated with Tinnitis. As well as this, it may be useful for temporarily relieving the pain of headaches and the congestion associated with mucous build up.<p>

Known also as the Maidenhair Tree, this useful herb may assist in improving blood flow to the brain - recent medical research has also shown that one of the key ingredients known as ginkgolide can be as effective as standard pharmaceutical drugs in treating severely irregular heart beats.<p>

If your circulation is poor consider Natural Nutrition Ginkgo 2500 which has been standardised to contain 24% of Ginkgo flavone glycosides which have been shown to be responsible for its pharmacological activity.<p>

Ginseng has been used in the Orient for more than 4,000 years. It became known as "The King of Herb's", because of its many therapeutic benefits, and was sought after by imperials and peasants alike. Koreans have used ginseng as a rejuvenative tonic for longer than any other Asian country, and have cultivated high quality Ginseng since 1300 A.D. for distribution throughout the world. A minimum growth period of 6 years before harvesting, and a total reliance on organic fertilisers, ensures the purity and potency of BIO-ORGANICS Korean Ginseng remains only the best.  Ginseng is itself a small perennial plant - the most potent varieties being found in Korea and Siberia. It is reputed to promote the hormone-producing glands, preventing tiredness and the debilitating effects of old age; it is also often used to maintain sexual potency and as an aphrodisiac. Apparently, Russian astronauts/cosmonauts take Ginseng for resistance to disease  and stress and to strengthen the immune system. <p>

Ginseng may assist athletes and other people involved in intense physical activity by increasing their stamina and endurance during demanding workouts. Executives, housewives and other busy people might also find Ginseng beneficial for reducing tiredness and the effects of stress upon the system. Where illness has been a problem, it may help during the convalescent period. Ginseng may also be valuable assistance to anyone suffering digestive disorders, for the temporary relief of sleeplessness. The BIO-ORGANICS brand of Korean Ginseng provides a powerful 2,500mg capsules of high quality Ginseng containing the active components Ginsenosides. <p>

Co-Enzyme Q10 may also be of benefit if you suffer from over-tiredness, especially for new mothers that may struggle with the workload of a newborn child. The main function of Co-Ezyme Q10 (CoQ10) is in the body manufacture of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) which is the basic energy molecule of cells in the body - it is the fuel which keeps the mitochondria working (the mitochondria is the "powerhouse" of the cell). More CoQ10 is found in heart tissue than any other muscle and it is important to its strength and health.  It is beneficial for the treatment of high blood pressure, angina pectoris, and other heart disorders. It is estimated that approximately 12,000,000 people in Japan are currently using this product for diseases of the circulatory system and stress. Co-Enzyme Q10 is also being tested for a wide range of other diseases including muscular dystrophy, Multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Schizophrenia, Lupus, Gastric ulcers, Allergy and Asthma.<p>

Combine Ginseng and Co-Enzyme Q10 to assist in the treatment of tiredness and fatigue.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>The Amazing Queen Bee</b><p>

The mystery of the queen bee's amazing lifespan has interested researchers for many years - why is it that of all bee larvae, the one chosen to be the queen bee grows to be twice as large as ordinary bees and lives approximately 20 times longer ? She also lays 2000 to 2500 eggs daily - an amazing reproductive feat. The answer, researchers believe lies in the queen bee's diet. she is fed exclusively on Royal Jelly - a potent mixture of pollen and special secretions produced from the glands of worker bees, while ordinary bees receive only pollen and nectar.<p>

Royal Jelly is a highly concentrated food produced by the glands of workers bees containing virtually every nutritional element needed for health. It is a rich natural food containing 13 vitamins, 16 minerals, 8 amino acids and 28 other nutrients - it is especially rich in vitamin B5. Royal Jelly has long been recognised and used by the Ancient Chinese for its potent energy giving properties. Presently it is being used by thousands of people all over the world, including many members of Britain's Royal Family.<p>

Recent research into the efficiency of Royal Jelly has thrust this natural food product back into the limelight. Japanese scientists have now identified the important indicator of Royal Jelly's potent qualities as HDA (hydroxy-2-decanoic acid). An HDA level of 2% or greater is important to the quality and potency of Royal Jelly Products. Be sure to check the label for certified 2% HDA - BIO-ORGANICS 1000mg Royal Jelly is the  highest potency supplement available. <p>

Royal Jelly is claimed to have a rejuvenating effect on the human cell and it promotes improvement in vigour, stamina and endurance . It also aids in the rehabilitation of malnourished patients.<p>

If you are asthmatic - use extreme caution when considering Royal Jelly as a supplement for you good health. It may cause a severe allergic reaction which can be fatal.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Kelp, Chlorella, Spirulina, Marine Lipids, Shark Liver Oil</H3><p>

<b>Where it All Began</b><p>

Scientists believe that much of the life on our planet had its genesis in the water, but in our adaptation as land animals, perhaps we have forgotten some of the treasures that still lie beneath the seas and lakes of the world. In fact, modern scientific research has shown us that the waters of our oceans are the richest known source of vital mineral elements. They have been described as a catchment area into which mineral substances of every kind have been dumped by the moving forces of nature.<p>

These vast sources may become much more important that any of us now realise, due to the effects that land degradation has on the soil. Currently it is from the soil that we derive our minerals, via the food that we eat. If the food that we grow on land can no longer supply us with all the nutrients that we need to protect our bodies from disease, then we may have to turn to the foods of the seas and lakes. It seems only reasonable that the plants and creatures, which are locked inevitably into the underwater food chain, have much to offer us right now, and have an even greater role to play in the future.<p>

Although this may be news to us, ancient maritime cultures such as the Japanese, the Chinese, the South-sea Islanders and Greenland Eskimos have known of the ocean's secretes for hundreds of years. Kelp, or common seaweed, has long been a favourite vegetable source amongst these nations. The ocean covers approximately 72% of the Earth's surface, and it's huge range of plant life remains relatively untapped. <p>

<b>Kelp</b><p>

This seaweed works like a sponge, absorbing from the water almost all the nutrients, vitamins, minerals and trace elements that are essential to life. Kelp was first used medicinally to treat enlarged thyroid glands - at this time the physicians did not know why kelp was effective, until it was discovered that it was exceptionally rich in iodine and that enlarged thyroids were commonly due to an iodine deficiency.<p>

Because the iodine worked by stimulating the thyroid gland that controls metabolism, it was noted that those who took iodine lost weight more easily. From these observations, kelp was then used to assist in weight loss. It has been suggested that kelp's positive effects in assisting metabolism may also help in lowering cholesterol blood levels. This versatile seaweed is also widely used to maintain healthy skin and hair - interestingly, 10-15% of Kelp's bulk is mineral in nature which compares favourably with other mineral rich foods such as carrots and almonds which contain only 3%. But, kelps most dramatic application is its ability to neutralise heavy metal pollution and radiation in the body.<p>

Studies have shown that the active ingredient in kelp, sodium alginate, can prevent the absorption of newly ingested heavy metals (such as mercury), but it has little effect on past exposures. Health authorities in America have discouraged people from collecting kelp along the shoreline because it could be contaminated by industrial pollution - commercially available kelp is of the deep ocean variety.<p>

The growth rate of Kelp plants is so vigorous, that when cut to a depth of four feet, they will actually grow back to the surface of the seas within 48-60 hours - this incredible growth rate is in part due to the ideal growing environment in which they live.  Natural Nutrition 
Mega Kelp 2000 Complex contains a combination of Kelp, Sea Lettuce, and Irish Moss and Acacia to give an optimum formula for the relief of dull hair, brittle nails, fluid retention, arthritis and other conditions previously discussed.<p>

<b>Chlorella</b><p>

Chlorella is an algae grown in shallow ponds rich in mineral salts and, like kelp, is a valuable source of the nutrients iron, zinc, and a particularly concentrated amount of Vitamin A. Vitamin A is renowned as an immune booster. There is 10 to 100 times more chlorophyll in Chlorella as there is in leafy green vegetables. The importance of chlorophyll is well-known for its ability to use the energy of the sun to manufacture nourishment for plants. It is believed that green plants carry  a concentrated sun energy that can be assimilated and released into the cell structure of the body, cleansing the body of toxins, energising the immune system, strengthening cell membranes and boosting natural energy.<p>

<b>Spirulina</b><p>

This microscopic blue-green algae is found in alkaline waters of shallow lakes. Spirulina is known as a "wonder food", and was part of the staple diet of the ancient Aztec civilisation. It is higher is protein, Vitamin B12 and iron than most other food sources. It also contains liberal quantities of Betacarotene, Chlorophyll, Vitamin E and the minerals phosphorous, potassium, calcium, magnesium and zinc.  By weight it is 65-71% protein compared with eggs (47%), brewers yeast (45%), Soya beans (35%), meat and fish (22%). It is also amazingly low in kilojoules, fat and cholesterol.<p>

Beef liver is generally regarded as the richest source of vitamin B12, yet Spirulina has twice the amount and has 10 times the amount of iron as that contained in the same weight of boiled spinach. Because Spirulina is particularly nutritious it is used as a slimming supplement. If between 5-6 tablets are taken 30 minutes before eating, it is believed the natural, concentrated amino acid content of this algae can "trick" the brain (the hypothalamus) into believing that the appetite has been satisfied after only a little food has been consumed.<p>

Spirulina may also assist in controlling "snacking" between meals. It helps to keep blood sugar at the proper level and supplies many of the nutrients that body may crave for. This algae is also very digestable, with a rate of 95% digestability, so it is rapidly absorbed into the body - this is becuase the Spirulina cell wall is soft and does not contain cellulose. It is completely safe and as such can be taken by children, nursing mothers, and pregnant mothers, the elderly and anyone who has difficulties in breaking down and abrosbing the nutrients of complex foods. <p>

<b>Marine Lipids</b><p>

EPA, a special fish oil ingredient is derived from cold waters of the ocean and should not be confused with Cod Liver Oil or Shark Liver Oil, as it contains no liver oil. Marine lipids are very high in the fatty acids, EPA and DHA. Studies involving the high fish diets of the Canadian Eskimos have shown that they have a very low incidence of heart disease, even though the fish that they eat is of the oily variety. The polyunsaturated nature of this fish oil, not only ensures that it contains no cholesterol, but may also be active in reducing harmful fats in the blood. Cod Liver Oil is an excellent source of vitamins A and D as well has being high in valuable fatty acids. <p>

<b>Shark Liver Oil</b><p>

Sharks are one of the strongest and most invincible of all creatures in the ocean. Besides their outward physical attributes to protect themselves, nature provided these creatures from the deep with amazing immunity to ill health. They never get cancer or the common problems associated with humanity. Norwegian fisherman in the 18th century discovered that oil extracted from the liver of the deep water shark, sped up skin tissue repair if applied to wounds. <p>

The fishermen filled stomach sacs of fish with the shark's liver oil and used it to alleviate respiratory tract infections. They also found through practical usage, that the oil strengthened them, especially when taken after illness. By the early 19th century, the use of shark liver oil had all but died out, apart from in a few isolated Scandinavian fishing communities. This valuable knowledge would have completely disappeared, had it not been for two Japanese scientists in 1922 who discovered a lipid which differs from the usually fatty substances by the presence of a single atom of oxygen - they called these healing molecules alkoxyglycerols.<p>

These molecules were synthesised in 1930 and then research into their versatile healing applications progressed rapidly. The technological advances of the 1940's and 1950's enabled the Swedish researchers, Hallgren and Larsson, to undertake extremely specific studies of shark liver oil in the 1960's. The liver oil was found to contain extremely high concentrations of active alkoxyglycerols, that were usually only found in breast milk and bone marrow - further scientific research was then undertaken over the next 20 years by other Swedish researchers.<p>

These eminent Swedish scientists made exciting discoveries that shark liver oil with its potent alkoxyglycerols activated and enhanced the body's lymphatic immune defence system by stimulating the formation of anti-bodies and increasing the number of white blood cells and thrombocytes in our blood. It also diminished the harmful side effects following radiation therapy by reducing leucopenia and thrombocytopenia (which both invariably occur during radiotherapy). The alkoxyglycerols neutralised and counteracted the detrimental changes in blood cell ratio, caused by treatment.<p>

The lymphatic system plays an important role in the body's immune system by repelling harmful bacteria, fungi and viral invaders. It is one of the major lines of the body's defences against disease and could be likened to the pipes of the plumbing system in a building. Its vessels carry tissue fluid, called lymph around the body. The lymph carries harmful substances from the tissues to be exterminated by the white blood cells in the lymph nodes, before the lymph is returned to the blood at the veins in the neck. The lymphatic nodes are small glands, situated in specific places in the body, which produce white blood cells - some of these cells produce antibodies and others ingest the invading bacteria, thereby destroying it. <p>

Shark Liver Oil has been extensively researched and scientifically proven that the active alkoxyglycerols in SLO have definite healing application, its indications for it's use would appear to include;<p>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Recurrent infections.
<LI>Strengthening the immune system, particularly in chronic degenerative diseases.
<LI>Beneficial for coughs, colds and influenza.
<LI>Important for tissue repair, delayed wound healing and acne.
<LI>Recommended before, during and after radiation therapy.
<LI>Promotes healing and recovery of the nervous system.
<LI>Normalises metabolism in diabetics.
<LI>Effective against viral hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver.
<LI>Has an analgesic and anaesthetising effect to neutralise pain.

Please note that shark liver oil products currently available are sourced from Scandinavia, where sharks are fished for human consumption and pet food and are not fished exclusively for its oil.<p>

<IMG SRC="images/h_vit_zinc_t1.gif" ALT="Zinc - The Superstar of Minerals" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="282" HEIGHT="23" BORDER="0" VSPACE="5"><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>Zinc - Why it Important to Our Health</b><p>

Zinc is needed in our bodies in trace amounts, for a multitude of important functions. In fact, the incredible value of this mineral is continuing to grow as more and more evidence comes to light. At least ninety of the body's metabolic enzymes require zinc to function properly. Zinc can be found in all body tissues, but especially in the eye, liver, brain, muscle and reproductive organs. It may be of immense value to the immune system, and is thought to play an important role in regulating insulin activity. But just as fast is zinc becoming recognised as a vitally essential mineral, studies are also showing many children and adults are suffering from zinc deficiency. Common signs of zinc deficiency are a poor sense of taste and smell, wounds that are slow to heal, excessive hair loss, impotency, growth impairment, and the appearance of white flecks on the fingernails.<p>

<b>Deficiencies - Who is at Risk ?</b><p>

Almost everyone may be at risk of becoming zinc deficient. Worldwide, zinc is the mineral most depleted from soil used to grow food. The refining techniques of the modern world actually take out valuable zinc from many of our grains. this may result in two of our most staple foods, bread and cereals being seriously lacking in nutritional value as far as zinc levels are concerned. Even canned, frozen and dried foods contain almost negligible levels of zinc. Populations of countries where the climate is extremely hot are at a greater risk of becoming zinc deficient through loss of this mineral in sweat. Also, particularly prone to this type of deficiency are pregnant women, teenagers and the elderly, as well as heavy drinkers, and those who consume a nutritionally poor diet.<p>

<b>Zinc - Of Special Importance to Men</b><p>

Zinc is essential to the entire male reproductive system. The male prostate gland contains more zinc than any other gland in the human body. Male sperm and seminal fluid are also very high in zinc. Deficiencies may cause prostate problems, retarded genital development, impotence or infertility. A recent study or Iranian and Egyptian youths, who showed signs of retarded sex organ development and overall growth, found their diets to be lacking in the mineral zinc. When zinc supplementation was begun, the problem immediately rectified itself, and the boys continued to develop normally. The most important discovery to come from this study was that the male hormone cannot be produced without zinc.<p>

<b>When Wounds are Slow to Heal</b><p>

The Ancient Egyptians knew about the healing properties of zinc. they used it in balms to treat skin irritations. Zinc is the healing ingredient in calamine lotion, and over the years has been added to various creams and ointments to relieve problems such as sunburn and rashes. But zinc may be even more effective to the healing process from within. When wounds occur, zinc is drawn to the site to help build collagen, it also helps to prevent an outbreak of infection. Extra zinc intake may be beneficial to the proper healing of surgical incisions, bed sores, canker or cold sores, and chronic leg ulcers as well as other everyday injuries where the skin tissue is damaged.<p>

<b>Acne - A Common Affliction</b><p>

As many as 80% of all teenagers are affected by acne. Studies show that it may be a lack of zinc, caused by a diet high in refined carbohydrates, that is one of the main causes in many cases of acne. Supplementation with zinc, usually of the chelated type to ensure better absorption, has been shown to help correct the acne problems of some teenagers. Zinc might also be useful in relieving other minor skin irritations such as eczema.<p>

<b>Zinc in the Treatment of Anorexia</b><p>

Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia, obesity and pica may be helped by extra zinc in the diet. Although zinc deficiency does not cause anorexia, the starvation diet of those suffering the condition can lead to a shortage of zinc. Loss of apetite is a classic symptoms of anorexia nervosa, as it is of zinc deficiency. The senses of taste and smell are also affected. Without these important senses it would be very difficult to break the starvation cycle. Research shows zinc supplementation may effectively restore the appetite and sense of taste and smell, and thereby assist those suffering eating disorders to rediscover healthy eating habits.<p>

<IMG SRC="images/h_vit_brindle_t1.gif" ALT="Brindle Berry" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="23" BORDER="0" VSPACE="5"><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Recent studies show that an extract from a rare tropical fruit may be the answer to the dieting problems endured by many overweight people. The rind of the exotic fruits of  the Garcinia cambogia tree, more commonly known as Brindle Berry, contain a unique substance that may effectively curb the appetite, inhibit the production of fats and cholesterol, and reduce food intake.<p>

The people of Southern Asia have used Brindle Berry for centuries as a food source and it is quite a common commodity in the markets of Southern India. the high acidity of the ripe fruit makes it difficult to eat raw. Instead the rind is usually dried and used as a flavouring condiment in curries, as a substitue for limes or tamarind. The rind has also been found to be a useful food preservative and digestive aid.<p>

In 1965, the rind of the Brindle Berry fruit was found to contain  a unique fruit acid which had never before been encountered in nature. The scientists who isolated the acid named it Hydroxycitric acid or more simply, HCA. It became the focus of interest when scientific reports published in severeal highly respected journals including the Journal of Biological Chemistry and the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed that it could effectively inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids in some animal livers. HCA was further shown to reduce food intake and body weight gain.<p>

<b>How Does it Work ?</b><p>

For those wishing to begin a weight loss programme, the most usual approach in recent times has been to concentrate on reducing calorie intake, altering the metabolism of fat or enhancing energy metabolism. Brindle Berry is thought to be different in its action, in that it inhibits the production of fats from carbohydrates. When carbohydrates are eaten, they are broken down into glucose and used for energy. The glucose that is not used immediately as energy is stored in the muscles and liver as glycogen. Once the glycogen stores become full, an enzyme known as ATP-citrase lyase, acts with any excess glucose molecules to produce fat and cholesterol. It is thought that HCA temporarily inhibits this final process by suppressing the action of this enzyme. Studies have shown that HCA may be effective in reducing fat production in the body by 40-70% for up to 12 hours after a meal.<p>

<b>Helping to Curb the Appetite.</b><p>

A bonus to dieters who use this remarkable Herb, is it's effectiveness  in curbing the appetite and reducing food intake. Because excess glucose is no longer being turned into fatty tissue, it remains stored as glycogen. The body's glycogen stores remain at a high level and the brain receives a message that energy reserves are full and so no more food needs to be consumed. Therefore the usual hunger pangs are effectively suppressed, which of course means it's just that much easier to keep to a low calorie intake. <p>

Brindle Berry is an all natural food that is safe and has no effect upon the central nervous system, like many prescription dieting aids do (such as Duromine, or Tenuate). Unlike some prescription medicines, rebound weight gain with Brindle Berry is minimal and the body does no grow accustomed to its effect.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>The Natural Way to Calm Unsettled Stomachs</b><p>

With 750mg of Ginger for effective relief of:<p>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Nausea
<LI>Stomach Upsets
<LI>Indigestion
<LI>Muscular Spasms
</UL><p>

<b>Ginger - Traditional Relief for Upset Stomachs</b><p>

You may well be aware of Ginger's fine reputation as a cooking additive, but did you know this spicy, aromatic Herb has been held in high esteem as a medicinal aid, especially in the area of stomach upsets, for many centuries ?   Ancient Indians used Ginger (Zingiber officinale) for digestive problems, as did Greeks and Romans. It became extremely popular in China, appearing in China's first great Herbal, the Pen Tsao (a Herbal is an encyclopaedia for herbs). Chinese women used Ginger to help alleviate menstral cramping and morning sickness, while Chinese sailors chewed the Herb to prevent seasickness.<p>

<b>Are You Worried by Indigestion ?</b><p>

When the digestive system is working well, good health usually follows. When there is something amiss you can expect the occurrence of uncomfortable symptoms of indigestion such as heartburn, flatulence and belching. Ginger contains a digestive enzyme known as zingibain. This enzymes effectiveness is thought to exceed that of papain which is an important enzyme for protein digestion. Ginger also increased salivary secretions and the concentration of the digestive enzyme, amylase in the saliva. It has a soothing effect on the stomach and helps tone intestinal muscles.<p>

<b>Nausea and Motion Sickness</b><p>

Perhaps one of Ginger's most valuable benefits is its ability to soothe the stomach and allay feelings of nausea. This anti-nausea action makes it a marvelous travelling companion to those who suffer from motion sickness. In fact one scientific investigation found conclusively that the gentle, natural relief Ginger brings to nauseous travelers, is more effective than the over-the-counter drug Dramamine, and there are no sedative side effects.  <p>

According to the Lancet report, the way in which the two substances work in relieving motion sickness is probably quite different. Ginger's aromatic and carminative properties suggest the herb arrests the effects of motion sickness in the gastrointestinal tract itself, thereby blocking any stomach reactions and subsequent nausea feedback. Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) is an antihistamine, and as such may act at a different level by dulling the effects of motion sickness. The Natural Nutrition Calm Quick formula includes 750mg of Ginger with other natural herbs including Chamomile, Cinnamon Bark Oil, and Peppermint Oil.<p>

This natural blend of Herb's works together to relieve stomach upsets, indigestion, nausea and muscular spasms/cramps. Chamomile is useful for soothing the stomach and also provides a calming effect while the oils of Cinnamon Bark and Peppermint enhance Ginger's anti-nausea action helping to settle upset stomachs. Calm Quick comes as convenient, fast acting capsules which are safe, effective and won't leave you feeling drowsy. <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>Are You Full of Hot Air? Avoid Embarrassment.</b><p>

Do you suffer from:<p>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Intestinal discomfort after eating ?
<LI>The embarrassment of flatulence ?
<LI>Uncomfortable stomach gas ?
<LI>Bad Breath ?
</UL><p>

<b>It's What's Inside That Matters</b><p>

Your electric food processor that probably cost you a small fortune is nothing compared to the one you were born with - the gastrointestinal tract !   This system is responsible for breaking down the food that you eat into fuel needed for your body. A class of proteins called enzymes are an important part of this process. Among these are protease (which breaks down proteins), amylase, which breaks down carbohydrates, and lipase, which works on dietary fats. It is interesting to note that the first secretion of digestive enzymes occurs through the saliva, while chewing. It seems that hurried meals, where chewing time is reduced to unproductive levels, does not get you off to a good start at all.<p>

<b>Down She Goes!</b><p>

Once in the stomach, the food is bombarded by gastric acids and stimulated by enzymes in the presence of proteins. Then, this partially digested food travels down into the duodenum, the upper part of the intestine. Here, the process of breaking down protein, carbohydrate and fat, for easier absorption, continues. The enzymes involved in this process are activated by the acidic nature of the food, acquired from the stomach. If acid levels are too low from an under stimulation in the stomach, these acids which alkalise the acid, are not triggered and, paradoxically, and over-acidity in the intestine can result. Stress is often related to low acid formation in the stomach at meal times.<p>

<b>BIO-ORGANICS Charcoal & Papaya May Assist Your Condition</b><p>

Although anyone can suffer the painful and sometime embarrassing symptoms of indigestion, the older we get, the more we seem to be plagued by intestinal pain. bloating, flatulence and bad breath. BIO-ORGANICS Charcoal and Papaya (with Peppermint Oil) has been formulated with sufferers of indigestion in mind.<p>

This formula is a natural combination of the following ingredients. Papaya is derived from the milky excretion of the unripe fruit and leaves of the Pawpaw plant. It is an extremely rich source of natural digestive enzymes, particularly papain and this assists in the digestion of protein. Activated Vegetable Charcoal is extremely porous and may help by absorbing stomach gas before it leads to bloating and flatulence.<p>

It has a deodorising and neutralising effect on gas in the intestine. Peppermint Oil has been added to this formula as it also assists digestion and may temporarily soothe the muscles cramped by indigestion. BIO-ORGANICS Charcoal and Papaya is available in a two piece, hard-shell capsules to make it easier to swallow, ensure rapid absorption and maximum therapeutic benefit.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>Monthly Misery</b><p>

For some women the monthly misery of cramp, pain, headaches, tiredness, bloating and mood swings is a very real and uncomfortable part of life. During her lifetime, the average woman will menstruate over a period of 35-40 years - altogether that could account for up to 2,500 days or around 7 years. Today, more and more women are looking to natural therapies to find relief from premenstrual symptoms. Natural Nutrition's Dong Quai Complex is a potent blend of natural Herb's in which 1000mg of Dong Quai is combined with Black Cohosh, Wild Yam, Crampbark, and Ginger Root for the temporary relief of period pain and the symptoms of pre-menstral syndrome.<p>

Dong Quai is the oriental member of the Angelica plant family. It is a highly nutritious herb containing significant amounts of vitamins E and B12. The Chinese have held Dong Quai in high esteem as a cure for many women's conditions for almost 2000 years. Traditionally this important herb has been used to treat menstrual problems, including cramping and pain and to bring balance to the monthly cycle - it is still popular today to temporarily relieve period pain and the symptoms of pre-menstrual syndrome including cramps and tension. It has been helpful for vaginal spasm or infections, hot flushes, hormonal imbalances and menopausal symptoms.  Black Cohosh, Wild Yam, Crampbark, and Ginger Root  are added to this potent formula each having a traditional action in the reducing of PMS symptoms. Black Cohosh is a useful diuretic herb to relieve mild fluid retention and bloating associated with pre-menstrual syndrome - it was traditionally used by Algonquian Indians for all manner of menstrual complaints. Wild Yam is known to contain anti-inflammatory properties while Ginger Root is used to help allay feelings of nausea.<p>

Optimum effect is achieved when Dong Quai is taken along with Evening Primrose Oil and Vitamin B6 - Natural Nutrition Dong Quai Complex may be the answer you have been looking for to ease those monthly blues.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Mega potency Echinacea 1000 Complex is a high potency combination of the Herb's Pau d'Arco, Astragalus, Beet Root, St John's wort and Echinacea and may:-<p>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Provide temporary relief from the symptoms of colds and 'flu.
<LI>Aid in wound healing.
<LI>Provide relief from the pain of arthritis and rheumatism.
<LI>Be a useful blood tonic.
<LI>Provide temporary relief from fevers.

</UL><p>

If the symptoms of colds and 'flu drag on and on, and each winter becomes an endless campaign against the evils of 'stuffy' noses and sore throats, then a great new product from the Bio-organics range may assist you by providing temporary relief and shortening the duration of these common, but debilitating symptoms.<p>

<b>Echinacea - The Versatile Herb</b><p>

The principle ingredient in this complex, Echinacea, is native to the central and western areas of the United States.  Among the first advocates of this versatile herb were the Cheyenne Indians, who were known to have chewed the root of the echinacea plant to prevent thirst.  Later references suggest that early North American settlers also found many therapeutic uses for Echinacea.  It became so popular, that less than fifteen years after its introduction to the settlers by a pioneer doctor around 1870, echinacea was already being sold by a Cincinnati pharmaceutical company for the treatment of infections.  It is now one of the most widely used Herb's with many varied therapeutic applications.<p>

<b>Herbal Healing Powers</b><p>

Not only do you get the benefits of 1000mg of echinacea, BIO-ORGANICS have also added the healing powers 150mg of Pau d'Arco and Astragalus.  pau d'Arco adds to echinacea's actions on colds, 'flu, allergies and for the temporary relief of arthritis pain, while Astragalus is useful during convalescence.  The addition of St John's Wort (25mg) makes this a useful complex for the treatment of minor skin disorders and 15mg of Beet Root is often recommended as a blood tonic.<p>

<b>Additive Free!</b><p>

BIO-ORGANICS Mega Potency Echinacea 1000 Complex contains no added sugar, starch, salt, lactose, gluten, artificial colours or flavours, saturated oils, preservatives or polysorbates, so you can be absolutely sure that you get well 100% naturally.<p>

<IMG SRC="images/h_vit_feverfew_t1.gif" ALT="Feverfew - A Natural Migraine Treatment" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="353" HEIGHT="23" BORDER="0" VSPACE="5"><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Classically migraines begin with a period of mild confusion, visual problems such as blind spots and flashing lights - this then leads on to supersensitivity to noise, and intense pain, often affecting only one side of the head. Migraines, for many sufferers can also have accompanying nausea and vomiting. It is now generally considered, that most migraines are a result of an irritation and swelling or constricting of the arteries in the head. Traditional treatments include ergotamine based medicines (Cafergot, Ergodryl, Migral), strong analgesics such as Codeine (as in Panadeine Forte), medications for nausea such as metoclopromide (Maxolon) and beta blockers such as propranolol (Inderal, Deralin). For more information regarding your specific treatment why not E-mail Mark or Jason.<p>

For years this assortment of drugs have been prescribed to help relieve the symptoms of migraine - yet although the benefits of natural medicines have been known to herbalist's for centuries, it is only recently that a particular Herb, Feverfew, has caught the attention of people in general. When taken progressively as a preventative measure, Feverfew capsules are an effective course for the temporary relief of headaches and migraines.<p>

Continued claims from migraine sufferers about Feverfew effectiveness, led to a clinical study by a British medical team. The ensuing report clearly showed that 72% of the participants, taking Feverfew capsules alone, recorded that their headaches were less painful, while only 24% thought the severity of their migraines were unchanged. Comparatively few migraine sufferers surveyed found other preventative medicines helpful, and even when they had, two-thirds had no longer found them necessary once they started taking Feverfew. This reported concluded; "It would seem desirable for commercial preparations of Feverfew to be standardised".<p>

More recent research suggests that Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) may have a role in the temporary relief of arthritis discomfort, and mild skin disorders as well as migraine. According to researchers in another published report, "Feverfew has been used since ancient times as a herbal remedy for the temporary relief of the discomfort of fever, arthritis and migraine". They found that Feverfew inhibits the secretion of polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN) granules, which have a damaging effect on inflamed joints and the skin. This inhibitory effect could account for the beneficial effect in migraine treatment.<p>

Nature's Own Feverfew Capsules have been formulated with Willow Bark (another effective herbal analgesic) for optimum efficacy - this formula, as with all Bullivants Natural Health Supplements contain no added sugar, starch, gluten, artificial colouring, artificial flavouring or preservatives.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>BIO-ORGANICS Horseradish Complex may offer relief of the symptoms of hayfever without causing drowsiness. It is non-habit forming and contains natural Herb's and vitamins.<p>

<b>Hayfever</b><p>

Hayfever is a form of allergy sometimes called pollinosis. In hayfever the mucous membrane lining the nose is sensitive to one or more kinds of pollen, dust or other allergens (an allergen is a substance which causes allergies). As a result, the mucous membrane swells and becomes inflamed. It is an extremely common complaint, and it is estimated to affect approximately 25% of the Australian population.<p>

<b>Causes and Symptoms of HayFever</b><p>

Hayfever sufferers know the symptoms all too well. Your nose may become congested and will probably 'run' profusely. An irritating itching in the roof of the mouth and throat, and sore runny eyes are likely. The nose lining of the hay fever sufferer contains antibodies which react to particular sorts of pollen grains. The tendency to produce these antibodies is often passed on genetically. Basically what happens is that your genes carry the requisite allergenic tendency, you body will develop a substance called reaginic-antibody or, IgE. In hayfever, the antibody is to be found  in the lining of the nose and bronchial tubes, eyes and skin. When pollen comes into contact with IgE antibody, a reaction takes place on the surface of the cell and various chemical substances are released causing/mediating the allergic reaction.
As a result the surrounding tissue swells with fluid, and there is a watery discharge and an outpouring of mucous on the surface. Pollen can cause the same reaction in the eyes, mouth and throat. Itching inside you  ear, on the roof of your mouth and in your throat may be a constant cause of irritation. You may feel generally ill and even develop a mild fever.<p>

<b>Seasonal Misery</b><p>

The incidence of airborne pollen rises significantly during the spring and summer months. During these months there will be between 0 and 400 grains per cubic metre of air. At 50 grains per cubic metre, anyone who is going to have an attack will have started sneezing.<p>

<b>Natural Relief</b><p>

The Herb's horseradish and garlic have been used for centuries as a gentle remedy for relief of the symptoms of hayfever. They are both non-habit forming and will not cause drowsiness unlike some over the counter medications. Horseradish helps to clear blocked nasal passages and provides relief of the symptoms of hay fever, while garlic is a broad spectrum herbal antibiotic, helpful in fighting mild bacterial infection. <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><HR><FONT SIZE="2">* If symptoms persist seek the advice of you regular physician or health care professional.<p>

* Vitamins may only be of assistance if dietary intake is inadequate.</FONT><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Research into the nature and function of L-Lysine has been carried out since the early 1950's, especially in relation to the claim that regular supplementation of this powerful amino acid could suppress the symptoms of the common cold sore (herpes simplex) virus.<p>

Once the cold sore virus (HSV) has found a foothold in the body, it will remain there forever, lying dormant until the immune system is weakened by such things as colds, stress, excessive physical and mental activity, fatigue, and sometimes exposure to the sun. The virus makes its presence known with the appearance of painful blisters on the lips, eyes and around the nose. These blisters may last for up to three weeks - an unattractive, distressing problem for adults and children alike.<p>

Experiments by an American scientist, Dr.R.Tankersley showed that in a laboratory culture dish, L-Lysine actually inhibited the growth of the herpes simplex virus. This amazing discovery led to the first clinical trial of L-Lysine in 1974, by Dr.Christopher Kagan - this trial was completely successful. L-Lysine is a natural amino acid used by the body to produce many important enzymes. It can be found in most protein rich foods such as dairy products, eggs, meat and yeast.<p>

L-Lysine is similar chemically to another amino acid known as arginine, which HSV uses as it's main building block - by supplying "extra" levels of lysine, the HSV uses lysine instead of Arginine which causes it do halt its replication process thereby reducing the symptoms of the infection. When suffering from cold sores, avoid arginine rich foods which include almonds, peanuts, chocolate, vegemite, carob, rice, wheat, legumes and apples. Consume plenty of foods that are high in L-Lysine, these include eggs, fish, meat, baked beans and dairy products.<p>

BIO-ORGANICS L-Lysine Complex contains 500mg of L-Lysine together with Zinc Amino Acid Chelate, Betacarotene, Calcium Ascorbate, Vitamins B3 and B6, and Magnesium Acid Chelate - these additives assist in tissue repair of damaged skin and enhance the effect of L-Lysine. At the first sign of a cold sore, start taking this formula to help avoid the onset of these unsightly, painful and embarrassing blemishes.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>When Your Medicine Makes you Sick</b><p>

When antibiotics were first discovered in 1928 by Alexander Gleming they were heralded as a breakthrough in modern medicine.  Bacterial infections that one were the cause of death, could now be controlled.  Antibiotics helped to completely eliminate scourges like smallpox, and have been successful in controlling some serious conditions like tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, septicemia and gonorrhoea.  Yet even though these substances retain great medicinal value, there are times when they can cause almost as much misery as they take away.  Constipation, diarrhoea, excess stomach gas, nausea and thrush are just some of the side effects of prolonged antibiotic use.  A break down in the body's natural resistance is another.<p>

<b>The Importance of Balanced Internal Bacteria</b><p>

Billions upon billions of live bacteria live within your intestine.  Some, like acidophilus are 'good', and perform many important duties in keeping your intestines healthy, aiding digestion and synthesizing important B Vitamins like B12, Biotin, Folic Acid and Pantothenic Acid in the body.  More importantly it is the 'good' bacteria that keep the 'bad' ones in check.  When you take a course of antibiotics you kill all bacteria, good and bad, and that's when the balance can become upset.<p>

Gosnells Amcal Chemist carrries natural acidophilus supplements that can help to restore intestinal flora to a healthy state.  Each time you need to take a course of antibiotics be sure you include one and avoid the uncomfortable after effects.<p>

<b>Your Immune System - Fighting the Battle from Within</b><p>

How often have you had a simple cold or flu that turned into something much more serious?  If your immune system is not functioning properly, what starts off as a simple bout of sneezing, sniffling and sore throat, can linger on and pave the way for bacterial infections that require antibiotic treatment.  With a little help from a healthy diet and some immune building nutrients, you may be able to eliminate the unwanted virus before it caused any trouble.<p>

Vitamin C is one of the most important nutrients you can employ in your battle for better health.  It helps to relieve the symptoms of colds and flu and builds resistance by increasing the body's production of infection fighting white blood cells.
 
The Herb Echinacea has long been used as an immune stimulant being an excellent tonic for the body's lymphatic system. By boosting the activity of white blood cells and purifying the bloodstream, echinacea helps to fight infections and to heal cuts and wounds more quickly.<p>

Zinc is a healing Mineral.  It helps to strengthen the immune system and increases resistance to infection.  Zinc is also important to the proper healing of wounds and cuts.<p>

<b>Nature's Natural Antibiotics</b><p>

Today antibiotics are prescribed for any number of minor conditions.  In so doing, many infection causing bacteria have developed an immunity to certain antibiotics.  This has called for stronger and stronger antibiotics to be found.  Sometimes a patient may need to try several kinds of this drug before they can successfully destroy damaging bacteria.  however, many of these conditions might successfully be treated by more natural methods.  <p>

Garlic is a natural antibiotic, with both antifungal and anti-viral properties.  It can be used to treat minor infections, such as those that affect the ear, mouth, throat and upper respiratory tract.  Unlike conventional antibiotics, Garlic helps to build the immune system so the body itself can join in the fight to regain lost health.  Garlic is also valuable in eliminating the uncomfortable mucus congestion the comes with colds and flu.<p>

There may be no need to suffer the uncomfortable side effects of conventional anitbiotics.  Become a part of your body's own healing process by providing it with all the necessary nutrients it needs to stay healthy.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>Sleep Without Drugs</b><p>

Not sleeping well ? Sometimes the hurried lifestyles many of us lead may make it difficult to stop at the end of the day and relax enough to fall asleep. Nights spent tossing and turning, mind still going over the days events, staring at the ceiling, waking often, stress, anxiety, all add up to a sleepless night. So what can you do about it ? Do you reach for drugs like Valium, Normison or Temazepam that are habit forming and can leave you feeling 'bombed out' or 'groggy' the next morning or are there natural alternatives. ?<p>

Natural Nutrition's Valerian 1000 is a natural alternative for the temporary relief of insomnia.  The soothing effects of this time tested Herb help you to slip peacefully into deep untroubled sleep, leaving you relaxed and refreshed, ready to enjoy the new day. What's more Valerian is non-habit forming! <p>

Valerian gets its name form the Latin word "Valere" meaning to be in good health. It was used as a tranquiliser by the British during the blitz of World War II. A herb with a remarkable calming effect upon the nerves, valerian is now used extensively to promote a strong, healthy nervous system. It is an effective agent in promoting normal blood pressure and helps the body cope with stress.<p>

<b>Coping With Stress</b><p>

When your mind and body are relaxed and calm, coping with those little upsets we all face every now and then is just a little easier. The gentle sedative action of Valerian may help to relieve the nervous tension associated with day to day stresses and worries, without leaving you feeling drowsy.<p>

<b>So What is Valerian ?</b><p>

Valerian is a popular Herb of European origin; so popular in fact, that it has been mentioned in virtually every Herbal Pharmacopoeia ever written. It is the roots of the Herb that hold the medicinal properties. For maximum potency they should be harvested in the autumn season. During the Middle Ages Valerian became known as "All Heal", because of its curative properties. Many of Valerian's traditional uses
include the relief of muscle spasms, insomnia, nervous tension and menstrual cramps.<p>

<b>Active Ingredients Discovered ! </b><p>

In 1966 the active ingredients of Valerian were discovered. They were named valepotriates and their sedative properties became the subject of a large amount of scientific investigation, especially in Germany and Russia, making Valerian one of the most studied plants. Research results are consistently favourable, especially in the areas of safety and sleep quality obtained.<p>

<b>Natural Nutrition Valerian 1000</b><p>

Using the dry root of Valerian, Natural Nutrition have produced a high potency Herbal supplement. Each vegetable coated tablet contains 1000mg of high quality Valerian extract, blister packed for your convenience. Natural Nutrition Valerian 1000 is useful for the temporary relief of sleeplessness, and for relieving stress, nervous tension and muscle spasms. It may also be used as an aid to relieve indigestion.*<p>

Next time you need relief during times of stress and sleeplessness, consider Natural Nutrition's Valerian 1000 - The highest potency Valerian product available.<p>

A sleep study conducted over 2-3 weeks with people who complained of snoring found Breathe Right reduced snoring in 80% of patients. The study also found that both the desaturation index and sleep latency were reduced in 80% of patients.<p>

<FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#6072FF">It has been shown in a study of patients prone to sleep disruption to provide users with improved sleep quality, easier breathing and less daytime sleepiness. Additional, the bed partners of Breathe Right users have reported a reduction in their partners level of snoring and movement throughout the night.

<IMG SRC="product/basketballer.jpg" ALT="Athletes Benifit with Breathe Right Nasal Strips" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="244" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Snorers are not the only people who can benefit from Breathe Right. Because Breathe Right makes it easier to breathe through the nose, a growing number of international athletes (especially those who need to wear a mouth guard) are using this drug-free device during competition. The Sports Medicine Committee of the United States Olympic Committee has declared drug-free Breathe-Right appropriate for use during Olympic competition. Breathe Right is used by the N.S.W. State of Origin Rugby League Team, AFL footballers, Olympic athletes and many more professional and amateur sportspeople. Studies have clearly showed there is a correlation between decreased nasal resistance achieved with the Breathe Right nasal strip and faster recovery times as measured by heart rate.<p>

Other uses include nasal congestion during pregnancy; people with breathing difficulties caused by physical conditions such as a deviated septum or collapsed nasal cartilage; allergic rhinitis and colds and flu (in a controlled study carried out on sufferers of nasal congestion, 71% of Breathe Right users rated the product as being effective or very effective for the treatment of nasal congestion).<p>

<b>The System</b><p>

If you're like most people, you enjoy looking at pictures a lot more than actually taking them. That's why Kodak has created the Kodak Advantix photo system. The Kodak Advantix photo system includes a number of exciting innovations that make it easy to shoot great pictures and take the hassles out of organising and reprinting your prints and negatives.<p>

"Intelligent" technology gives you more good pictures from each roll.<p>

<IMG SRC="images/apsformats.gif" ALT="Choose your photo formats" HEIGHT=138 WIDTH=205 ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="2"> Cameras that feature Information Exchange imprint important data from the picture-taking scene directly onto Kodak Advantix film's magnetic coating. This technology helps ensure that all your pictures are of optimum quality.<p>

The new Advantix system allows you to choose from three print formats including Normal, Group and Panoramic. Your negatives are returned in the original film cassette - you never have to handle your negatives, so they're not exposed to dust, finger prints or scratching.<p>

The new system makes it far easier than the conventional system to organise and identify your negatives - each processed film is accompanied by an "Index Print" which shows every shot in a proof sheet form to improve referencing when ordering reprints and enlargements.<p>

<b>The Film</b><p>

The heart of the Kodak Advantix photo system is a completely new, elliptically-shaped film cassette. The cassette works with any Advanced Photo System camera, and features a number of innovations that make it easier than ever to take great pictures.<p>

<B>New Exciting Innovations include;</B><p>

Leaderless design simplifies loading. This convenient feature helps prevent accidental double exposure and blank rolls.
Kodak "Thrust Engine" technology advances the film - this makes possible many Advanced Photo System features such as drop-in loading and mid-roll change.
A magnetic coating on the film stores data. Information used by the photofinisher to "custom print" each shot. It can also store information to be printed on the back of photo's.
Film cassette doubles as Film Safe. Each film cassette stores and protects your processed negatives and is numbered to match the corresponding Index Print.
Film Status Indicator. Lets you know at a glance whether the roll is "Unexposed", "Partially Exposed", or "Processed".<p>

<b>Kodak Fun Flash Camera</b><p>

The Kodak Fun Flash Camera incorporates a flash unit that provides lighting for indoor and low-light situations. The fixed-focus lens produces sharp photos from 1.2m to infinity. The Kodak Gold III 400 film extends the effective flash distance, thereby producing better indoor pictures. Easy to use flash is activated by a simple sliding lever. When used inside the UN Underwater housing, this camera can be used to take colourful underwater photos.

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="product/org_kodak_logo.gif" ALT="Kodak Logo" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="67" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">Film speed relates to the time the camera lens shutter is open allowing the exposure of your film to the image ahead. The higher the number, the faster the shutter speed. <p>

Generally the slower the film speed (25,50,64) the more light you need to achieve optimum results. The advantage of slower films is extremely sharp results without noticeable grain. Use slow speed film when photographing still lifes and portraiture under very sunny/bright conditions.<p>

Medium speed films (100,200) offer excellent results for multi-purpose photography. Use them for slow to moderate action shots. Used with a flash, medium speed films are very versatile.<p>

The faster the film speed (400,1000), the less light you need to achieve good results. You can use the film's flexibility to freeze fast action or shoot under lowlight conditions. Fast films are excellent for fireworks, indoor sports and very fast moving subjects.<p>

Australians and international customers now have access to a revolutionary drug-free adhesive strip which, when applied to the outside of the nose gently opens the nasal passages - reducing airflow resistance by 31% and making breathing easier. This exciting new device can reduce snoring, relieve nasal congestion and may even improve sports performance - just look at some of our Olympic athletes and elite sportsmen.<p>

<IMG SRC="/product/nasalstrip.jpg" ALT="Breathe Right Nasal Strips" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="204" HEIGHT="75" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#6072FF">Breathe Right Nasal Strips, a simple yet ingenious device from 3M Pharmaceuticals, will enable you to breathe well, breathe easy, and above all, Breathe Right.</FONT><p>

Breathe Right nasal strips are a completely mechanical, and therefore drug-free, means of opening nasal passages and reducing airflow resistance. Each strip is lined with two plastic strips which form a backbone. When properly placed between the bridge and end of the nose, the strip gently lifts the soft areas of skin above the flare of each nostril. As the plastic strip straightens it carefully opens nasal passages, making breathing easier.<p>

A sleep study conducted over 2-3 weeks with people who complained of snoring found Breathe Right reduced snoring in 80% of patients. The study also found that both the desaturation index and sleep latency were reduced in 80% of patients.<p>

<FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#6072FF">It has been shown in a study of patients prone to sleep disruption to provide users with improved sleep quality, easier breathing and less daytime sleepiness. Additional, the bed partners of Breathe Right users have reported a reduction in their partners level of snoring and movement throughout the night.

<IMG SRC="/product/basketballer.jpg" ALT="Athletes Benifit with Breathe Right Nasal Strips" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="244" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10">Snorers are not the only people who can benefit from Breathe Right. Because Breathe Right makes it easier to breathe through the nose, a growing number of international athletes (especially those who need to wear a mouth guard) are using this drug-free device during competition. The Sports Medicine Committee of the United States Olympic Committee has declared drug-free Breathe-Right appropriate for use during Olympic competition. Breathe Right is used by the N.S.W. State of Origin Rugby League Team, AFL footballers, Olympic athletes and many more professional and amateur sportspeople. Studies have clearly showed there is a correlation between decreased nasal resistance achieved with the Breathe Right nasal strip and faster recovery times as measured by heart rate.<p>

Other uses include nasal congestion during pregnancy; people with breathing difficulties caused by physical conditions such as a deviated septum or collapsed nasal cartilage; allergic rhinitis and colds and flu (in a controlled study carried out on sufferers of nasal congestion, 71% of Breathe Right users rated the product as being effective or very effective for the treatment of nasal congestion).<p>

<b>The System</b><p>

If you're like most people, you enjoy looking at pictures a lot more than actually taking them. That's why Kodak has created the Kodak Advantix photo system. The Kodak Advantix photo system includes a number of exciting innovations that make it easy to shoot great pictures and take the hassles out of organising and reprinting your prints and negatives.<p>

"Intelligent" technology gives you more good pictures from each roll.<p>

<IMG SRC="/images/apsformats.gif" ALT="Choose your photo formats" HEIGHT=138 WIDTH=205 ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="2"> Cameras that feature Information Exchange imprint important data from the picture-taking scene directly onto Kodak Advantix film's magnetic coating. This technology helps ensure that all your pictures are of optimum quality.<p>

The new Advantix system allows you to choose from three print formats including Normal, Group and Panoramic. Your negatives are returned in the original film cassette - you never have to handle your negatives, so they're not exposed to dust, finger prints or scratching.<p>

The new system makes it far easier than the conventional system to organise and identify your negatives - each processed film is accompanied by an "Index Print" which shows every shot in a proof sheet form to improve referencing when ordering reprints and enlargements.<p>

<b>The Film</b><p>

The heart of the Kodak Advantix photo system is a completely new, elliptically-shaped film cassette. The cassette works with any Advanced Photo System camera, and features a number of innovations that make it easier than ever to take great pictures.<p>

<B>New Exciting Innovations include;</B><p>

Leaderless design simplifies loading. This convenient feature helps prevent accidental double exposure and blank rolls.
Kodak "Thrust Engine" technology advances the film - this makes possible many Advanced Photo System features such as drop-in loading and mid-roll change.
A magnetic coating on the film stores data. Information used by the photofinisher to "custom print" each shot. It can also store information to be printed on the back of photo's.
Film cassette doubles as Film Safe. Each film cassette stores and protects your processed negatives and is numbered to match the corresponding Index Print.
Film Status Indicator. Lets you know at a glance whether the roll is "Unexposed", "Partially Exposed", or "Processed".<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="/product/org_kodak_logo.gif" ALT="Kodak Logo" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="67" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">Film speed relates to the time the camera lens shutter is open allowing the exposure of your film to the image ahead. The higher the number, the faster the shutter speed. <p>

Generally the slower the film speed (25,50,64) the more light you need to achieve optimum results. The advantage of slower films is extremely sharp results without noticeable grain. Use slow speed film when photographing still lifes and portraiture under very sunny/bright conditions.<p>

Medium speed films (100,200) offer excellent results for multi-purpose photography. Use them for slow to moderate action shots. Used with a flash, medium speed films are very versatile.<p>

The faster the film speed (400,1000), the less light you need to achieve good results. You can use the film's flexibility to freeze fast action or shoot under lowlight conditions. Fast films are excellent for fireworks, indoor sports and very fast moving subjects.<p>

As always we encourage you to <A HREF="mailto:enquiries@gac.com.au">E-mail</A> us with your queries, or why not explore the official <A HREF="http://www.kodak.com.au/cgi-bin/vsc/index.html?L+gac+ahtf6092" TARGET="page">Kodak website</A> for other information and some great digital images.<p>
