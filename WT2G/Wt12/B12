<P>
In order to achieve the improvement in air quality specified in
the AQMP, the control measures listed in the Plan must be adopted
and implemented within the timeframes set forth. In the event
that implementation of the AQMP is not providing adequate progress
and the interim emission reduction goals have not been met, the
District must take action to bring forward measures that are scheduled
for later adoption or implementation, or to implement certain
&quot;contingency&quot; control measures. These contingency measures
are control options that could be instituted in addition to the
AQMP control measures. Both state and federal Clean Air Acts require
that district plans include contingency measures. In addition,
several measures are identified for further evaluation which could
be adopted in the future if found to be feasible.
<P>
A total of 24 control measures have been identified and categorized
in two groups: Level I, or contingency measures, and Level II,
or further measures which are not feasible at this time but will
be reevaluated to determine if these measures are needed to attain
state air quality standards or potential future federal ozone
and particulates air quality standards. Table 9-1 lists the Level
I measures and Table 9-2 lists the Level II measures. In addition,
certain control measures from the 1994 AQMP are removed from this
Plan, having been determined to be infeasible. The following paragraphs
provide a summary of these control measures. A complete discussion
is included in Appendix IV, Section 6.
<H3><a name = "92">LEVEL
I: CONTINGENCY MEASURES</H3>

<P>
Level I measures are actions that can be implemented given existing
statutory authority. Such measures would need to be developed
and adopted as rules. The responsibility to adopt and implement
the Level I measures falls on the District, ARB, and U.S. EPA.
The measures would be implemented in the order specified in the
1997 AQMP until the shortfall is eliminated. A ranking of the
importance of each measure relative to ozone and/or carbon monoxide
planning requirements under the federal Clean Air Act is provided
in Table 9-1 for the Level I measures.
<H3><a name = "93">LEVEL II: FURTHER EVALUATION MEASURES</H3>

<P>
Level II measures are from the 1994 AQMP and have been determined
as being infeasible at this time, requiring further evaluation.
It has been further demonstrated that the federal ambient air
quality standards can be attained within the statutory time frames,
without these measures, which are listed in Table 9-2. The District
will continue to assess these measures to determine if in the
aggregate these measures will be beneficial in attaining state
air quality standards and potential future federal air quality
standards.

<P>
There are 18 measures designated as Level II contingency control
measures. The basis for each measure's designation as Level II
contingency is described below.
<P>
<B>CMB-01 </B>Phase II RECLAIM would expand the RECLAIM program
to facilities with NOx and SOx emission reductions below 4 tons
per year. Expanding the RECLAIM program may pose an administrative
burden to the District and some of the subject facilities. However,
the feasibility of this approach should be reevaluated in the
future to determine if circumstances have changed.
<P>
<B>CMB-02 </B>This measure includes unpermitted miscellaneous
combustion sources, curing and drying ovens, after burners, metal
melting furnaces, and internal combustion engines. Emission reductions
from non-RECLAIM combustion sources would involve the regulation
of several tens of thousands of non-permitted emission sources.
Implementing the control measure would require the identifying
and on-going enforcement of thousands of currently unpermitted
combustion sources at mostly small business sites. In addition,
estimates of control technology and associated costs may be difficult
due to the diverse nature of small businesses using these deminimus
combustion equipment. For some devices, the control costs are
also expected to be over the acceptable cost-effectiveness threshold
for rule development. At this time there is no technology for
further control of the internal combustion engines which would
be part of this control measure. Therefore, the administrative
burden and lack of control technology make this measure infeasible
at this time.
<P>
<B>CMB-08</B> Control technology to reduce PM10 emissions from
this source category is expensive and difficult to install and
operate. In addition to cost and technology considerations, the
total mass emission reductions are also small from refinery process
heaters, due to other controls already in place to reduce NOx
and SOx emissions. Uncertainty as to the potential emission reduction
technology prevents the District from establishing an emission
reduction factor for this control measure. It is believed also
that the emission reductions would be minimal. This measure is,
therefore, considered neither technically nor economically feasible
at this time.
<P>
<B>CMB-10 </B>Glass melting furnaces not subject to the RECLAIM
program represent a small emission source category. Potential
emission reductions from this category, even with a high control
efficiency, would be low. The emission reductions expected from
this control measure are less than 20 pounds per day of NOx. The
administrative burden of bringing such a rule forward, at this
time, is not justifiable for the minimal emission reductions likely.
<P>
<B>CMB-11</B> Non-RECLAIM incinerators represent a small emission
source category. The further emission reduction potential which
could be achieved by this control measure would, therefore, be
relatively low regardless of the control efficiency factor. This
control measure has an estimated emission reduction of 0.11 ton/day
of NOx. The administrative burden of developing a rule is not
justified at this time for such a minimal emission reduction.
<P>
<B>CTS-02A</B> Electronic component manufacturing represents a
small emission source category. The emission reduction potential
which could be achieved by this control measure would be relatively
low regardless of the control efficiency factor. This control
measure has an estimated emission reduction of 0.17 tons/day.
The administrative burden of developing a rule is not justified
at this time for such a minimal emission reduction.
<P>
<B>CTS-02D(1) </B>and<B> CTS-02D(2)</B> These measures would further
regulate emissions from marine vessel and pleasure craft coatings
respectively. The emission reductions which could be expected
from the two control measures combined represents a total of approximately
60 pounds of VOC per day. The administrative burden of developing
a rule is not justified at this time for such a minimal emission
reduction.
<P>
<B>CTS-02G</B> This contingency measure calls for further emission
reductions from paper, fabric and film coating operations. The
estimated emission reductions which might be achievable from this
measure are also relatively small (340 pounds of VOC per day).
Considering the costs of rule development and implementation that
would be required of the District, as well as high compliance
costs for minor emission reductions, implementation of this measure
is not feasible at this time.
<P>
<B>CTS-02I(1)</B> The potential emission reductions which could
be achieved from implementation of this control measure are minimal,
representing a 20% reduction, when compared to the administrative
burden of developing the rule. There is, however, technical uncertainty
associated with the control technology to further control VOC
emissions from screen printing operations. Therefore, it has been
determined that this control measure is infeasible and will be
delayed due to cost, and administrative burden relative to the
minimal gain in emission reductions.
<P>
<B>CTS-02J </B>Due to concerns regarding the availability and
feasibility of the required coating technology, the measure has
been moved to Level II contingency status and will continue to
be evaluated. Staff will propose further considerations when technology
developments are found to be acceptable, cost-effective and technically
feasible for this industry group.
<P>
<B>CTS-02K</B> Aerospace assembly and component manufacturing
operations are already regulated to a great extent. The further
emission reductions which would be targeted by this control measure
are minimal, amounting to approximately 120 additional pounds
of VOC per day. The administrative burdens of rule development
are not justified at this time for such a minimal emission reduction.
The measure has, therefore, been moved to a Level II contingency
and will be subject to future evaluation.
<P>
<B>CTS-02L </B>This contingency measure would further regulate
the emissions from motor vehicle assembly line operations, of
which there is currently only one in the Basin. The expected emission
reductions of 40 pounds per day of VOC. The administrative costs
of rule development do not justify pursuing the measure at this
time.
<P>
<B>PRC-02 </B>This measure's aim of achieving further emission
reductions from bakery operations would require the application
of controls on low-emitting bakeries. Larger emitting bakeries
are currently controlled by the terms of existing Rule 1153. The
remaining bakeries represent a small source category and the expected
emission reductions would be minimal (approximately 160 pounds
per day of VOC). At this time it is more cost effective to proceed
with the implementation of other measures which can achieve a
greater emission reduction at equal or lesser administrative cost.
<P>
<B>PRC-05 </B>The malt beverage, wine and brandy producing facilities
within the District's jurisdiction represent a minimal emissions
source category. The anticipated emission reductions from this
control measure would be less than 20 pounds per day. The administrative
burden of proceeding with implementation of this measure is not
at this time justified by the minimal emission reductions that
would be gained.
<P>
<B>MON-02</B> This control measure seeks emission reductions due
to excessive starts of new and used vehicles at car dealerships.
The measure would be implemented either through District regulations
or local ordinances. There were no emission reduction estimates
for this measure in the 1994 AQMP. Enforcement issues do not justify
pursuing this measure at this time.
<P>
<B>MON-04</B> This control measure seeks emission reductions due
to excessive curb idling. The measure would be implemented through
local ordinances. There were no emission reduction estimates for
this measure in the 1994 AQMP. Enforcement issues do not justify
pursuing this measure at this time.
<P>
<B>CTY-07 </B>This contingency measure seeks further emission
reductions through limiting goods movement activity if the Basin
does not attain an applicable federal air quality standard. Several
concerns are raised with such a program including economic impacts
to the region and the appropriate implementation authority. As
such, further evaluation to the feasibility and cost-effectiveness
of this measure is needed.

<P>
The rationale for deleting these 1994 AQMP control measures from
the 1997 AQMP is explained in the following paragraphs.
<P>
<B>CMB-05</B> This control measure was intended to achieve emission
reductions by requiring the use of clean fuels in stationary sources.
The NOx emission reductions which were expected from this control
measure will be achieved through the implementation of existing
NOx control rules. Additionally, due to issues of safety and operating
requirements, it is not feasible in all circumstances to completely
eliminate the option for stationary sources to use standard fuels
as a back up fuel during emergencies or other unexpected situations.
<P>
<B>CTS-01</B> The proposal to implement a RECLAIM program for
VOC emissions has been placed on hold at this date. In place of
CTS-01, substitution control measures from the 1994 AQMP are proposed
to be implemented in the 1997 AQMP. This measure is not considered
socially feasible at this time.
<P>
<B>CTS-02F</B> This control measure calls for further control
of sources currently regulated under Rule 1151 sources. The measure
would affect a large number of very small operations. The costs
of implementing the measure, estimated at $50,600 per ton, are
high and the emission reduction potential is minimal in comparison
to the number of sources involved. The measure is, therefore,
not considered to be feasible due to its high impact on small
operations and the costs of implementation.
<P>
<B>CTS-02I(2)</B> The further control of emissions from graphic
arts operations was found not to be cost effective. The estimated
cost per ton would exceed $100,000. Given the existing control
on graphic arts operations and the control cost this additional
measure would place on these operations compared to the amount
of emission reductions that would be achieved, the measure has
been dropped.
<P>
<B>ISR-01 </B>through<B> ISR-05</B> These control measures would
have required actions by indirect sources to reduce emissions
resulting from vehicle trips. These indirect sources do not have
any control over the actions of motorists driving to their facility,
unlike employers. Moreover, except in the case of schools, there
is not a continuing, repetitive pattern of trips to these sources.
For these reasons, it is much more difficult for these sources
to reduce trips through ridesharing programs than it is for larger
employers. Over the last few years, the legislature has consistently
restricted, and bills have been introduced, to abolish district
authority over indirect sources. This contributes to the conclusion
that these measures are infeasible due to social considerations.
0In addition, 1996 state legislation eliminated the specific transportation
performance standards which motivated the inclusion of these measures
in previous plans.
<P>
<B>PRC-04</B> The emission reduction potential from control of
rubber products manufacturing envisioned in this measure is below
20 pounds per day. The minimal emission reduction potential of
this measure is outweighed by the costs and administrative burden
of adopting the measure.
<P>
<B>RFL-01 </B>This control measure would require the design and
use of a fuel tank interface for utility equipment to accept only
an interlocking fuel spout. In addition, gasoline dispensing facilities
would be required to only dispense gasoline into approved non-spill
containers. Further evaluation of this measure indicates that
at this time, this measure is not cost-effective and is administratively
burdensome relative to the potential emission reductions. Enforcement
of this control measure would require monitoring thousands of
consumers that fill small fuel containers and then transfer that
fuel into utility equipment, such as lawn and garden equipment.
The cost and time required for the District or ARB to certify
or approve fuel tanks or nozzles is not an effective use of resources
at either agency or the industry, given the modest potential emission
reduction of 80 pounds per day. Thus, the administrative burden
and cost to enforce this control measure would be extensive relative
to the minimal emission reduction potential of this measure.
<P>
<B>RFL-03 </B>Upon further analysis, implementation of this measure
has been determined to be technically infeasible and not cost-effective.
Through various meetings, the U.S. Coast Guard has raised issues
regarding regulating pleasure boat refueling operations and has
expressed concern for public safety. In addition, it has become
apparent that most pleasure boat fueling operations occur at conventional
gasoline dispensing facilities as compared to marinas, which typically
have only one fueling facility.
<P>
<B>FSS-01</B> This further study measure was proposed to develop
programs to reduce emissions under Stage I episode conditions.
State law has removed the District's authority to require rideshare
programs. As such, this measure has been removed from the 1997
AQMP.
<P>
<B>CTY-06 </B>This contingency measure was proposed to reduce
emissions through implementation of parking cash-out programs
for employers having 25 or more employees. State law has removed
the District's authority to require rideshare programs. As such,
this measure has been removed from the 1997 AQMP.

<H3><A NAME="31">INTRODUCTION
</H3>

<P>
This chapter summarizes emissions occurring in the Basin during
the base years 1987, 1990, and 1993, and projected emissions in
the years 2000, 2006, 2010. More detailed emission data analyses
are presented in Appendix III of the 1997 AQMP. Additional emission
inventories for other interim years (i.e., 1997, 1999, 2002, 2003,
2005, 2007, 2008) are also developed. These inventory years are
selected to comply with federal and state Clean Air Act requirements.
Under the federal and state Clean Air Acts, the District is required
to report the Basin's emission reduction progress for nonattainment
pollutants. The base year to measure the Basin's progress is 1990
for both the federal and state Clean Air Acts. A 1987 and a 1990
emission inventory were reconstructed to reflect the most recent
inventory methodologies. Adopted air quality rules and regulations
have current and future compliance dates. The 1993 base year emissions
inventory reflects adopted air regulations with current compliance
dates; whereas future baseline emissions inventories are based
on adopted air regulations with both current and future compliance
dates. A list of District rules and regulations that are part
of the base year and future-year baseline emissions inventories
is presented in Appendix III. Some of these rules have not been
approved by U.S. EPA, however the District is committed to implement
these rules that are incorporated in the 1997 AQMP baseline emissions
inventories.
<P>
The emissions inventory is divided into four major classifications:
point, area, off-road, and on-road sources. The 1993 base year
point source emissions are based principally on reported data
from facilities. The area source and off-road emissions are estimated
jointly by ARB and the District. The on-road emissions are calculated
using the ARB EMFAC7G emission factors and the transportation
activity data provided by SCAG. The 1987 and 1990 inventories
were reconstructed/backcasted based on the same general methodology
as the 1993 inventory so as to reflect current knowledge. For
example, EMFAC7G was applied to the 1987 and 1990 vehicle activity
data to backcast 1987 and 1990 on-road mobile emissions. This
approach provides a more consistent basis for evaluation of emission
reduction progress.
<P>
The future emission forecasts are based on demographic and economic
growth projections provided by the Southern California Association
of Governments (SCAG). The California Energy Commission (CEC)
energy forecasts for the petroleum industry and gas appliance-related
categories incorporating energy efficiency standards are also
used to refine emission projections. In addition, emission reductions
resulting from ARB and District regulations adopted by September
30, 1996 are included in the emission forecasts. The rules and
regulations adopted beginning in 1996 are treated as baseline
adjustment measures to account for their emissions impacts.
<H3><A NAME="32">EMISSIONS
INVENTORIES</H3>

<P>
Baseline emissions data presented in this chapter are based on
average annual day emissions (i.e., total annual emissions divided
by 365 days) and seasonally adjusted planning inventory emissions.
The 1997 AQMP uses annual average day emissions to estimate the
cost-effectiveness of a control measure, to rank control measure
implementation, and to perform PM10 modeling and analysis. Theplanning inventory emissions developed to capture the emission
levels during the poor air quality season are used to report emission
reduction progress as required by the federal and state Clean
Air Acts. Three planning inventories are prepared for the 1997
AQMP: an ozone inventory for summer volatile organic compounds
(VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions; a carbon monoxide
(CO) inventory for winter CO emissions; and a nitrogen dioxide
(NO2) inventory for winter NOx emissions. In addition, the most
recent U.S. EPA VOC definition (i.e., exclusion of acetone, ethane,
and PERC) is applied for the purpose of AQMP inventory development.
<P>
Detailed descriptions of the base year and future baseline emission
inventories are presented in Appendix III - Base Year and Future
Year Emission Inventories.<P>
<b>Stationary
Sources</b>

<P>
Stationary sources can be divided into two major subcategories:
point and area sources. Point sources are generally large emitters
with one or more emission sources at a permitted facility with
an identified location (e.g., power plants, refinery boilers).
Area sources generally consist of many small emission sources
(e.g., residential water heaters, architectural coatings) which
are distributed across the region. Their emissions over a given
area may be calculated using socioeconomic data. For 1987, reported
data is used for point sources emitting more than 8 tons/year
of any one of the criteria air contaminants and the District's
permit system data base is relied upon to estimate emissions for
smaller sources; for 1990 and 1993, reported data is used for
facilities with emissions greater than or equal to 2 tons/year.
<P>
Area source emissions were jointly developed by the ARB and the
District for a total of more than 200 categories. Several special
studies were conducted to improve the area source inventory. ARB
has recently completed a statewide inventory for degreasing operations
identifying solvent cleaning emissions not previously inventoried.
In addition, the most recent source test data for restaurant operations
(e.g., charbroiler and deep fryers) was used for the 1997 Plan.
<P>
Finally, significant progress has been made since the adoption
of the 1994 AQMP to improve PM10 fugitive dust and ammonia emission
inventories. The following sections summarize the progress and
the results for a variety of projects related to emission inventory
improvement.<P>
<b>Fugitive Dust and Ammonia Inventory Updates</b>

<P>
As part of the 1994 AQMP process, it was recognized that the fugitive
dust and ammonia inventories should be reviewed and revised, if
necessary, prior to the development of the 1997 AQMP. Since that
time, the District has participated in a number of fugitive dust
and ammonia emission projects, as well as following projects by
other sponsors. Based on the results of these studies and more
recent activity level information, the District has prepared updated
1993 fugitive dust and ammonia emission inventories.
<H4>Best Available Control Measure (BACM) Working Group</H4>

<P>
The District, through the cooperative efforts of the BACM Working
Group, embarked on an accelerated program to correct previously
identified fugitive dust inventory deficiencies. The BACM Working
Group is an ongoing task force comprised of representatives from
U.S. EPA Region IX, ARB, South Coast AQMD, San Joaquin Valley
APCD, Great Basin APCD, Mojave Desert AQMD, Clark County Nevada,
Washoe County Nevada, Maricopa County Arizona, Arizona Department
of Environmental Quality, USDA Soil Conservation Service, Coachella
Valley Association of Governments, and WESTAR (Western States
Air Resource Council). The emission inventory projects included
studies aimed at improving emission factors for such fugitive
dust sources as paved roads and construction, as well as quantifying
previously uninventoried sources. Emission factors for entrained
paved road dust and construction were significantly lower thanprevious estimates based on these studies. Previously uninventoried
sources, such as entrained leaf blower and unpaved shoulder dust,
were generally found to be small contributors to the overall inventory.
<H4>PM10 Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP)</H4>

<P>
The results from three emission inventory projects from the District's
PM10 Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP) have been used to revise
the fugitive dust and ammonia inventories. The Fugitive Dust Integration
project summarized previous inventory development and current
and past emission factor studies. It also provided recommendations
for the best available emission methodology, emission factors,
and activity estimates for each fugitive dust category. These
recommendations were used by District staff in the development
of the fugitive dust inventory. A second PTEP project was the
development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) to prepare
spatially-resolved fugitive dust inventories. Spatially-resolved
1993 construction dust emissions have been prepared for the 1997
AQMP.
<P>
A separate PTEP project measured emissions from livestock waste
at local dairies, since it was believed that current local dairy
operations were significantly different than those used to derive
previous emission estimates. Results from this study indicated
that the emission factor for local dairy waste was approximately
70% less than the factor used in previous emission inventory estimates,
since earlier studies were not based on local area conditions.
<H4>Updated 1993 Fugitive Dust and Ammonia Inventories</H4>

<P>
Activity levels for all sources were updated to the 1993 base
year, which reflects the impact of the local economic activities
as well as Rule 403 on construction emissions. Overall, updated
emission factors and activity levels for several categories led
to a 54% reduction in fugitive dust emission estimates. Figure
3-1 compares the changes in fugitive dust inventories between
1994 and the 1997 Plans.
<P><center>
<B>FIGURE 3-1</B> 
<P><IMG SRC="3-1.gif"><p>
1993 Fugitive Dust Inventory for the 1994 AQMP and the 1997 AQMP
</center><P>
The 1993 livestock waste ammonia inventory is approximately 50%
less than the 1987 emission estimate used in previous plans. The
reduction results from the reduced emission factor for dairy livestock
waste and the 1993 animal population statistics, which showed
a decrease in poultry from the 1987 levels. It should also be
noted that previous ammonia emission estimates for wastewater
treatment plants were overstated compared to the ammonia emissions
reported in the AB 2588-required Air Toxics Inventory Report and
from source testing. Based on this and other information, 1993
ammonia emission estimates for wastewater treatment plants are
now calculated to be 100 times smaller than previous estimates.<P>
<b>Mobile
Sources</b>

<P>
Mobile sources consist of two subcategories: on-road and off-road
sources. On-road vehicle emissions are calculated using socioeconomic
data and transportation models provided by SCAG, spatial distribution
data from Caltrans' Direct Travel Impact Model (DTIM), and emission
factors (EMFAC7G) obtained from the ARB. The 1990 Census data
is reflected in the SCAG socioeconomic data, and the 1991 origin
and designation survey data is used in the SCAG transportation
model. Major improvements made to EMFAC7G include:
<UL>
<LI>Redefining starts and redistributing starts by vehicle age;
<LI>New start emissions methodology;
<LI>Fuel corrections for diesel;
<LI>High emitter adjustments;
<LI>Driving cycle adjustments; and
<LI>Implementation of adopted rules (e.g., enhanced inspection
and maintenance program, 4.0 gram NOx standards for heavy-duty
diesel trucks and urban diesel buses, and 2.5 gram NOx standard
for heavy-duty gas trucks).
</UL>

<P>
Based on the vehicle activity data and EMFAC, an upgraded DTIM
model (i.e., DTIM2) is used to estimate on-road mobile emissions.
Figure 3-2 compares the on-road emissions between EMFAC7F and
EMFAC7G.
<P>
Emissions from off-road vehicle categories (e.g., trains, ships,
utility engines) were developed primarily based on the estimated
activity levels and emission factors. A special study was conducted
by ARB to improve the emission estimates for pleasure craft. A
separate study to inventory ship emissions was recently completed
and the emission estimates from that study have been incorporated
into the 1997 AQMP
<p>
<b>Gridded Emissions</b>

<P>
For air quality modeling purposes, the region is composed of the
South Coast Air Basin, Coachella Valley, Antelope Valley, Ventura
County (upwind area), and Mojave Desert. The modeling area is
divided into a grid system composed of 5 km by 5 km grid cells
defined by Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates. Both
stationary and mobile emissions are allocated to individual grid
cells within this system. In general, the modeling emission data
features episodic-day emissions. Seasonal variations in activity
levels are taken into account in developing gridded stationary
point and area source emissions. Variations in temperature, hours
of operation, speed of motor vehicles, or other factors are considered
in developing gridded motor vehicle emissions. Hence, &quot;gridded&quot;
emissions data used for ozone modeling applications (Chapter 5)
differ from the average annual day or planning inventory emission
data in two respects: 1) the modeling region covers larger geographic
areas than the Basin; and 2) emissions represent day-specific
instead of average or seasonal conditions. In the 1997 AQMP, gridded
inventories associated with four ozone and two PM10 episodes have
been prepared for air quality modeling analyses. In addition,
gridded emissions for 1995 were developed to calculate annual
average PM10 concentrations.<A NAME="_Toc358778749"></A><A NAME="_Toc358779247"></A>

<b>Reconstructed
1987 and 1990 Emission Inventories</b>

<P>
The federal and state Clean Air Acts have specified the 1987 and
1990 emission inventories, respectively, as the baseline for measuring
emission reduction progress. Therefore, inventories for both years
have been revised since the adoption of the 1994 AQMP to reflect
improvements in emissions estimates and inventory methodology;
this provides a consistent basis for emission trend analysis.
Most noticeably, a significant change in methodology has been
made to on-road and PM10 categories. Tables 3-1 and 3-2 present
the reconstructed 1987 and 1990 emissions by major source category
for the criteria pollutants VOC, NOx, SOx, CO, and PM10.
<p><b>1993
Emission Inventory</b>

<P>
Table 3-3 shows the 1993 emission inventory. Figure 3-3 characterizes
relative contributions by stationary and mobile source categories.
Stationary sources are subdivided into point (e.g., chemical manufacturing,
petroleum production, and electric utilities) and area sources
(e.g., architectural coatings, residential water heaters, and
consumer products). Mobile sources consist of on-road (e.g., light-duty
passenger cars) and off-road sources (e.g., trains and ships).
<P>
Overall, total mobile source emissions account for 61 percent
of the VOC and 88 percent of the NOx emissions for these two ozone-forming
pollutants. The on-road mobile category alone contributes about
51 and 63 percent of the VOC and NOx emissions, respectively and
approximately 78 percent of the CO.
<P>
Within stationary sources, point sources contribute more NOx and
SOx emissions than area sources. However, area sources play a
major role in VOC emissions, emitting about two to three times
more than point sources. Furthermore, area sources are the predominant
source (87 percent) of PM10 emissions due to inclusion of travel-related
activity.

Relative Contribution By Source Category to the 1993 Inventory

<P>
In the mobile source category, emissions from on-road vehicles
are much higher than those from off-road sources for all criteria
pollutants except SOx. This can be explained by the fact that
the sulfur content in fuels used for off-road vehicles is relatively
higher than those for on-road vehicles.

Figure 3-4 compares the 1993 inventory with the reconstructed
1987 and 1990 inventories. As can be seen, slight emission reductions
are shown for all stationary source pollutants due to adopted
air regulations. Existing ARB vehicle regulations result in reductions
in VOC and CO. The noticeable increase in NOx emissions between
1987 and 1990 is due to the shift to 1990 census data as well
as the estimated increase in heavy-duty vehicle VMTs.

*CO Emission values were divided by 10.

<b>Data
Development </b>

<P>
The milestone years 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005,
2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010 are the target years for emissions
rate-of-progress estimates under the federal Clean Air Act and
the state Clean Air Act. In addition, an emissions inventory for
the year 2020 is also prepared for the first time to form the
basis for a first look at the air quality once the region attains
the federal clean air standards. Due to the adoption of the NOx
and SOx RECLAIM program in October 1993, future emissions are
divided into RECLAIM and non-RECLAIM emissions. Future NOx and
SOx emissions from RECLAIM sources are estimated based on their
initial allocations as specified by District Rule 2002. The revised
allocations for the six source categories as part of District
Rule 2015 technology review are incorporated in the RECLAIM emission
forecast. The forecasts for non-RECLAIM emissions were derived
using: 1) emissions from the 1993 base year; 2) expected controls
after implementation of District and ARB rules adopted by September
30, 1996; and 3) emissions growth in various source categories
between the base and future years. Rules adopted after September
30, 1996 are treated as baseline adjustment measures for emissions
reduction accounting purposes. A detailed description of the forecasting
methodology is provided in Appendix III of the 1997 AQMP.
<P>
Demographic growth forecasts for various socioeconomic categories
(e.g., population, housing, employment by industries), developed
by SCAG, were used to estimate future emissions. The 1990 Census
data were used to validate the 1990 socioeconomic data and future
growth. Industry growth factors for 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and
2020 were provided by SCAG. Growth factors for other interim years
were interpolated between key forecast years. CEC-adopted energy
efficiency standards and energy-based forecasts for the petroleum
industry are also used to improve emission forecasts for certain
gas appliance and refinery operation related categories. Table
3-4 summarizes key socioeconomic parameters used in the 1997 AQMP
for emissions inventory development.

Current forecasts indicate that this region will experience a
population growth of 21 percent by the year 2010 with a 29 percent
increase in vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The current projection
for the year 2010 shows about half a million decrease in population
and a 36-million mile decrease in VMT forecast as compared to
the projection from the 1994 AQMP. The differences in the forecasts
are primarily due to the change in base year from 1990 to 1993.
<p><b>Summary
of Baseline Emissions</b>

<P>
Emission data by source categories (point, area, on-road mobile
and off-road mobile sources) and by pollutants are presented in
Tables 3-5 through 3-7 for the years 2000, 2006, and 2010.
<P>
Without any additional controls, VOC, NOx, and CO emissions are
expected to decrease due to existing regulations, such as the
LEV and oxygenated fuel programs, and the RECLAIM program. Figure
3-5 illustrates the relative contribution to the 2010 inventory
by source category. A comparison between Figures 3-3 and 3-5 indicates
that the on-road mobile category continues to be a major contributor
to CO and NOx emissions. However, due to the adopted LEV regulation,
by 2010 on-road mobile accounts for about 19 percent of total
VOC emissions compared to 51 percent in 1993. Meanwhile, area
sources become the major contributor to VOC emissions from 30
percent in 1993 to 48 percent in 2010.

</H3>

<P>
Air quality modeling is an integral part of the planning process
to achieve clean air. As mentioned in Chapter 1, the submittal
of the 1994 California Ozone SIP served as the ozone attainment
demonstration for the South Coast Air Basin and those portions
of the Southeast Desert Modified Nonattainment Area which are
under the District's jurisdiction. The attainment demonstrations
provided in this Plan reflect the updated emissions baseline estimates,
new technical information and enhanced air quality modeling techniques,
and the control strategy provided in Chapter 4.
<P>
The Basin is currently in nonattainment for nitrogen dioxide,
PM10, ozone, and carbon monoxide. Three of these pollutants -
nitrogen dioxide, PM10, and ozone - are linked to common precursor
emissions. The District's goal is to develop an integrated control
strategy which: 1) ensures that ambient air quality standards
for all criteria pollutants are met by the established deadlines
in the federal Clean Air Act (CAA); and 2) achieves an appropriate
rate of reduction in excess exposure to PM10 and ozone over the
next five to ten years. The overall control strategy is designed
so that efforts to achieve the standard for one criteria pollutant
do not cause the deterioration of another. A three-step modeling
process was originally developed in the 1989 AQMP to develop the
control strategy. The three-step process begins with an analysis
of future nitrogen dioxide air quality, followed by PM10 air quality,
and lastly, future ozone air quality. Air quality analyses under
the 1997 AQMP are performed in keeping with this three-step modeling
approach.
<P>
While attainment of all federal criteria pollutant air quality
standards is the goal of all AQMP revisions, previous AQMP revisions
placed greater emphasis on ozone air quality modeling due to the
complex chemical and physical interactions of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen. However, over the past
ten years, a better understanding of the complex nature of PM10
formation has led to a need to acquire enhanced technical information
on PM10 and particulate air quality modeling techniques.
<P>
The control strategy to meet federal and state carbon monoxide
standards is independent of the nitrogen dioxide/PM10/ozone strategy.
A photochemical grid model is used to project future carbon monoxide
(CO) air quality. As mentioned previously, the Basin has not exceeded
the federal annual standard for nitrogen dioxide since 1991 and
the state one-hour standard has not been exceeded since 1993.
Air quality modeling is provided here to demonstrate continuing
maintenance of the federal and state nitrogen dioxide standards.
Visibility impairment analyses are also performed even though
neither the CAA nor the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) specifically
require that visibility be addressed for planning purposes.
<P>
Detailed information on the modeling approach, data gathering,
model development and enhancement, model application, and interpretation
of results is presented in Appendix V. The following sections
summarize the results of the modeling efforts. Future air quality
projections for the Antelope Valley and Coachella Valley are presented
in Chapter 8 and Appendix V.
<H3><a name = "52">MODELING
APPROACH</H3>

<b>Nitrogen
Dioxide</b>

<P>
A linear rollback approach is used to evaluate future nitrogen
dioxide concentrations. It assumes that the ambient concentrations
above background levels are directly proportional to the emissions
in the immediately adjacent areas. In mathematical terms, the
rollback relationship can be written as follows:
<P>
Cp = [(Cb -k) Qp/Qb]+k (1)
<P>
where Cp and Cb are the future year and baseline oxides of nitrogen
(NOx) concentrations, respectively, Qp and Qb are the future year
and baseline NOx emission rates, respectively, and k denotes the
background. For the nitrogen dioxide analysis, the background
concentrations are assumed negligible.
<P>
Projections are made for several key locations in the Basin representative
of areas with recent nitrogen dioxide violations. Future-year
annual average nitrogen dioxide concentrations were determined
from projected total NOx concentrations using averaged NO2/NOx
ratios for the period 1992 to 1994 at each of the locations. The
reader is referred to Appendix V for additional details on the
technical approach.
<p><b>PM10
</b>

<P>
Within the Basin, PM10 particles are either directly emitted into
the atmosphere (e.g., primary particles), or are formed through
atmospheric chemical reactions from precursor gases (e.g., secondary
particles). Primary PM10 includes road dust, diesel soot, combustion
products, and other sources of fine particles. Secondary products,
such as sulfates, nitrates, and complex carbon compounds are formed
from reactions with oxides of sulfur, oxides of nitrogen, VOCs,
and ammonia.
<P>
Because of the dual nature of PM10, a combination of different
modeling techniques (receptor and photochemical grid models) is
used to estimate the source contributions to ambient PM10 levels
as measured at different monitoring sites. In addition, the air
quality projections using the various modeling techniques are
compared to a modified emissions rollback method (similar to that
described for nitrogen dioxide, except that the rollback is performed
on a component-by-component basis) to provide assurance that the
modeling techniques are giving directionally appropriate conclusions.
This speciated rollback methodology is described in more detail
in Appendix V. It should be noted that this methodology cannot
distinguish between primary and secondary carbon as compared to
measured organic carbon levels. Since the distinction between
primary and secondary organics can only be estimated, the speciated
rollback technique was applied under two assumptions: primary
carbon domination and secondary carbon domination.
<P>
The following section summarizes the PM10 modeling studies conducted
in preparation for this Plan. Details of the PM10 modeling are
presented in Appendix V.
<P>
<U><B>PM10 Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP) Modeling Studies</B></U>

<P>
Due to the complex nature of PM10, a variety of air quality modeling
techniques can be used. Nonreactive PM10 components such as fugitive
dust can be estimated using chemical mass balance or source-receptor
techniques where fingerprinting of various source profiles is
necessary to identify source contributions. In addition, dispersion
models (both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional) can also be used
to estimate nonreactive PM10 component concentrations. Traditionally,
simple linear rollback techniques (such as that used for nitrogen
dioxide) are used to estimate nonreactive PM10 components also.
For PM10 components that are secondary in nature (i.e., species
formed through chemical transformation), air quality models which
have the capability to handle PM10 chemical and physical processes.
Many of these models have been developed under research sponsorship
and have not been extensively applied to-date.
<P>
In 1995, the District embarked on a PM10 Technical Enhancement
Program (PTEP) to acquire new PM10 air quality models or enhance
the current PM10 models in order to project future-year PM10 concentrations.
Several projects were undertaken including the acquisition of
an episodic aerosol model, a fugitive dust model, a source apportionment
model, enhancements to the chemical mass balance (CMB) source
profiles, and updating the secondary sulfate and nitrate chemistry
used in the particle-in-cell dispersion model. These projects
provided a suite of PM10 air quality modeling techniques that
could be used to assess PM10 air quality.
<P>
Since the 1989 AQMP, the District has been applying a particle-in-cell
(PIC) dispersion model to examine annual secondary sulfate and
nitrate concentrations. The PIC model has limited capabilities
in examining large regions (beyond the boundaries of the South
Coast Air Basin) due to the model's formulation and simple treatment
of meteorology. As part of the PTEP, the District embarked on
modifying the Urban Airshed Model (UAM), the photochemical grid
model used for ozone air quality analysis. The UAM is a proven
air quality model capable of modeling large complex regions. However,
the chemical mechanism in the UAM does not estimate secondary
sulfate and nitrate concentrations. As such, the PTEP sponsored
the enhancement of a set of empirical relationships between precursor
emissions and sulfate and nitrate formation. (A similar set of
empirical relationships was developed for the PIC model.) The
enhanced empirical relationships are incorporated into the UAM
replacing the ozone photochemical mechanism. Model performance
evaluations with the 1995 PTEP ambient measurements indicate that
the modified UAM (known as UAM/LC) provides reasonable estimates
of the annual sulfate and nitrate concentrations. In addition,
the UAM/LC has the ability to model primary PM10 emissions. While
the UAM/LC was developed to estimate annual sulfate and nitrate
concentrations, the UAM/LC can also be used for shorter-term sulfate
and nitrate concentrations. However, intensive efforts must be
undertaken to prepare meteorological and air quality inputs needed
to perform the model evaluation. The UAM/LC model evaluations
are discussed in Appendix V.
<P>
Previous AQMP revisions also used the Chemical Mass Balance (CMB)
model to assess source-receptor relationships. The CMB relies
on source profiles to relate the contributions from various sources
to measurements at a given location. As part of the PTEP, some
of the CMB speciation profiles were updated.
<P>
In order to analyze local fugitive dust impacts, the PTEP identified
a need for a fugitive dust model. The fugitive dust model has
the capability to analyze fugitive dust impacts on a very localized
area which is smaller than the resolution of most more complex
3-dimensional grid models. The PTEP envisioned that if the episodic
aerosol model tended to underestimate fugitive dust concentrations,
then the fugitive dust model results would substitute the fugitive
dust results of the episodic aerosol model.
<P>
The third air quality model in the suite of PM10 air quality models
is the source apportionment model. The source apportionment model
provides the additional capability to analyze the impacts of various
sources at a given location. While the source apportionment model
can simulate 24-hour PM10 concentrations, the primary purpose
of the model is to evaluate different control strategies and the
relative contributions from the sources affected by the control
strategies.
<P>
To analyze 24-hour PM10 concentrations, an episodic aerosol model
application study was sponsored under the PTEP. The episodic aerosol
model has been under development since 1989 with sponsorship from
both the District and the Air Resources Board (ARB). The episodic
aerosol model has the capability to model all major PM10 species.
However, since the model is a 3-dimensional grid model, it is
inherently a resource intensive model and cannot readily be used
to estimate 24-hour PM10 concentrations. While the PTEP project
advanced the state-of-science of episodic aerosol model development,
at this time, continued research is needed before the model can
be relied upon as the primary approach to simulate 24-hour PM10
concentrations. In addition, techniques must be developed to expand
the episodic PM10 concentration estimates to an annual average
value.
<P>
Draft working papers for the 1997 AQMP provide discussions on
each of the PTEP modeling projects.
<P>
<U><B>AQMP Modeling Approach</B></U> 
<P>
Receptor models require specific knowledge about the chemical
components of the ambient PM10 samples and of all sources emitting
primary PM10. Special studies were conducted to develop a data
base and a comprehensive library of chemical profiles for specific
sources of PM10 emissions. Using the CMB model, ambient PM10 concentrations
at each site can be apportioned according to the contributing
sources.
<P>
For secondary PM10 components (sulfates and nitrates) and primary
PM10 emissions, the UAM/LC is used to project annual concentrations
in the South Coast Air Basin and Coachella Valley. Based on the
change in PM10 concentrations from the base year and future-year
projected by the UAM/LC, the projected future-year 24-hour PM10
concentrations can also be estimated.
<P>
Using the CMB and the UAM/LC, the major secondary PM10 components:
nitrates, sulfates, secondary organics, and the primary, nonreactive,
components can be estimated.
<P>
These models are used in combination with emissions projections
to determine future PM10 air quality for a given future-year baseline
or control scenario. For secondary organics, a linear rollback
technique is applied to the CMB results to obtain future year
projections while the UAM/LC is used to project the other components.
Measurements from the five PTEP monitoring stations are used (Los
Angeles, Anaheim, Diamond Bar, Rubidoux, and Fontana). The 1995
annual PM10 concentrations represent the PM10 design values for
the South Coast Air Basin and all future-year PM10 air quality
projections are compared to the 1995 concentrations. Detailed
discussions of the model results are provided in Appendix V.

</H2>

<P>
The CAA requires that ozone nonattainment areas designated as
serious and above use a photochemical grid model to demonstrate
attainment. The photochemical grid model (or air quality simulation
model) recommended by the U.S. EPA for ozone analyses is the UAM.
UAM is an urban scale, three-dimensional, grid-type, numerical
simulation model. It is designed for computing ozone concentrations
under short-term, episodic conditions lasting one to three days.
UAM is also the recommended model for ozone analysis by the ARB.
<P>
It is desirable to perform ozone air quality analyses using several
different meteorological episodes. Only one episode was modeled
for the 1989 AQMP. Since then, measurement data from the 1987
Southern California Air Quality Study (SCAQS) (Lawson, 1990) became
available for modeling purposes. For the 1991 AQMP, three ozone
meteorological episodes were used to predict future air quality;
two meteorological episodes during the SCAQS were used to complement
the single episode from the 1989 AQMP. For the 1994 AQMP, two
additional episodes are added to the analysis.
<P>
For the 1997 AQMP, the first modeling episode developed for the
1989 AQMP (the June 5-7, 1985 episode) is dropped from further
use since the meteorological conditions rarely occur in the Basin.
The current form of the federal ozone air quality standard allows
for one exceedance per year to account for these rare meteorological
events. As such, a peak ozone concentration due to meteorological
conditions in the June 1985 episode would be accounted for in
the current form of the standard. In addition, the U.S. EPA modeling
guidelines recommend that meteorological episodes from 1987 to
present be used for attainment demonstration Table 5-1 lists the
four meteorological episodes used for ozone air quality analysis,
along with their peak measured ozone concentrations in the South
Coast Air Basin, Antelope Valley, and Coachella Valley.

The CAA requires the use of an areawide model to describe the
accumulation of emissions over several hours and kilometers within
the region, as well as estimates of roadway impacts within a few
hundred meters of the roadway intersection. Based on U.S. EPA
modeling guidelines, the UAM is used for the areawide analysis,
and CAL3QHC, a roadway intersection model, is used to calculate
carbon monoxide concentrations near the intersection. The UAM
results are used to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures
in attaining the federal 8-hour air quality standard for carbon
monoxide in the year 2000. Carbon monoxide attainment demonstrations
were submitted to the U.S. EPA in 1992 and 1994. Since that time,
newer emission estimates have become available. Thus, the 1997
AQMP contains a revised attainment demonstration which will replace
the prior submittals. A complete description of the modeling analysis
is presented in Appendix V.
<P><b>Visibility
</b>

<P>
Future-year visibility in the Basin is projected using the results
derived from a regression analysis of visibility with air quality
measurements. The regression data set consisted of aerosol composition
data collected during a special monitoring program conducted concurrently
with visibility data collection (prevailing visibility observations
from airports and visibility measurements from District monitoring
stations). A full description of the visibility analysis is given
in Technical Report V-C of the 1994 AQMP.

AIR QUALITY</H3>

<b>Nitrogen
Dioxide</b>

<P>
Under the federal Clean Air Act, the Basin must comply with the
federal annual nitrogen dioxide air quality standard by November
15, 1995 [Section 192(b)]. Since the annual standard is based
on the calendar year, attainment must be demonstrated for calendar
year 1994. As discussed in Chapter 2, the Basin has met the federal
annual standard the last four years (i.e., 1992 through 1995)
and the state one-hour standard the last two years (i.e., 1994
and 1995). The modeling results discussed next show that the Basin
will continue to meet federal and state nitrogen dioxide standards.
<P>
Figure 5-1 presents the predicted annual average nitrogen dioxide
concentrations for 2000 and 2010 with and without controls. Maximum
1hour nitrogen dioxide concentrations are projected from the baseline
maximum 1hour concentrations using linear rollback. The predicted
maximum 1hour nitrogen dioxide concentrations for the future-year
baseline conditions with and without controls are shown in Figure
5-2.

<P>
The results indicate that the federal annual nitrogen dioxide
standard will be met throughout the Basin through the year 2010
without additional emission controls. However, implementation
of proposed controls after 1997 would further reduce nitrogen
dioxide concentrations in the Basin.
<P>
Based on projected future-year maximum 1-hour nitrogen dioxide
concentrations assuming no further controls, the Basin will be
in compliance with the state 1hour standard through the year 2010.
Implementation of proposed controls after 1997 would further reduce
nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the Basin.
<P><b>PM10</b>

<P>
Under the federal Clean Air Act, the Basin must comply with the
federal PM10 air quality standards by December 31, 2001 [Section
188(c)(2)]. A five-year extension could be granted if attainment
cannot be demonstrated and several other conditions are satisfied
[Section 188(e)]. Figures 5-3 and 5-4 depict future annual average
PM10 air quality projections at five PM10 monitoring sites compared
to federal and state annual PM10 standards, respectively. Although
each standard is based on an annual average, separate calculations
are required because the federal standard is based on an arithmetic
average, whereas the state standard is based on a geometric average.
In general, geometric averages are slightly less than arithmetic
averages. Shown in each figure are the estimated baseline conditions
for the years 1995, 2000, 2006 and 2010, along with projections
for 2000, 2006, and 2010 with control measures in place. All areas
will attain the federal annual standard by the year 2000, except
Rubidoux, which will be in compliance by 2006. Relative to the
state annual standard (&#181;g/m3), Los Angeles, Anaheim, and
Diamond Bar are projected to attain by 2006. Rubidoux and Fontana
will not be in compliance by 2010.
<P>
The projections for the 24-hour state and federal standards are
shown in Figure 5-5. The results are similar to those for the
annual standards. All areas will be in attainment of the federal
24-hour standard (150 &#181;g/m3), except Rubidoux, which will
be in compliance by 2006. With respect to the state 24-hour standard
(50 &#181;g/m3), none of the sites will be in attainment by 2010.

<P><b>Ozone
</b>

<P>
As the only ozone nonattainment area designated as extreme, the
Basin must comply with the federal ozone air quality standard
by November 15, 2010. The attainment demonstration shown here
addresses this requirement. As discussed earlier, four meteorological
episodes are used in the ozone attainment demonstration. The modeling
results for each of the episodes exhibit similar ozone air quality
projections. The results for the June 23-25, 1987 and August 26-28,
1987 episodes are presented here since these two episodes are
more limiting than the other two episodes (i.e., July 13-15, 1987
and September 7-9, 1987). The modeling results for all episodes
are presented in Appendix V.
<P>
The ozone modeling discussion that follows is divided into two
sections: projected baseline concentrations and predicted controlled
concentrations. The baseline projections assume no further controls
in the future years and the predicted controlled concentrations
assume the implementation of the 1997 AQMP control strategy at
the appropriate level for the year modeled.
<P>
Table 5-2 shows the total VOC and NOx emissions in the Basin on
the first day of the June 23-25, 1987 episode. The emissions presented
in Table 5-2 are episode-specific and therefore differ from the
planning inventories reported in Chapter 3. The modeling results
indicate that without additional controls, there will be some
air quality improvement relative to peak ozone concentrations
from 1987 to 2010 as VOC emissions decrease. However, after 2010
the ozone air quality is projected to degrade slightly.

<P>
* Peak ozone concentrations for future years are for the last
day of the June 1987 episode.
<P>
** Peak measured ozone concentration.
<P>
The VOC emission reductions are due mainly to decreases in mobile
source emissions whereas the oxides of nitrogen emissions decrease
more slowly due to increases in off-road activities (see Chapter
3 for a discussion of future-year emission estimates).
<P>
Figure 5-6 depicts the predicted baseline basinwide maximum ozone
without further AQMP measures for the June and August 1987 meteorological
episodes modeled. As shown, basinwide peak ozone concentrations
are on the order of 15-16 pphm from 2000 to 2010. Similar modeling
results are seen for the other two 1987 meteorological episodes
(see Appendix V).
<p><b>Control
Strategy Impacts</b>

<P>
Figure 5-7 shows the predicted Basinwide maximum ozone for the
June and August 1987 meteorological episodes for the years 2000,
and 2010, with proposed emission controls in place. The maximum
ozone concentrations and emission levels are also presented in
Table 5-2. The results indicate that the proposed control strategy
will almost eliminate health advisories (<U>&gt;</U> 15 pphm)
around the year 2000 and will bring the entire Basin into compliance
with the federal ozone standard by the year 2010. Regional maximum
ozone concentrations in the year 2010 will be between 9 and 12
pphm for the four meteorological episodes. With implementation
of the proposed control strategy, the peak ozone value for the
June 1987 episode is 11.8 pphm.

will be significantly reduced in the future years in all parts
of the Basin, the Mojave Desert Air Basin, and the Salton Sea
Air Basin with the implementation of proposed control measures
in the South Coast Air Basin. Similar results occur for the other
meteorological episodes.</A> 
<p><b>Assessment of Mobile Emission Uncertainties</b>

<P>
As discussed in the 1994 AQMP, recent studies indicate that current
and historical on-road mobile source emissions may be underestimated
by as much as 60 percent for VOCs and 8 percent for oxides of
nitrogen. For the 1997 AQMP, an updated version of the emissions
factor program (EMFAC7G) indicates that all on-road motor vehicle
precursor emissions have increased compared to the on-road motor
vehicle emissions estimated in the 1994 AQMP. However, the emission
increases are still uncertain given the uncertainties in the transportation
model assumptions and the assumptions inherent to the current
on-road motor vehicle emissions estimation procedures. As faster
computer systems become available, more sophisticated procedures
for estimating on-road motor vehicle emissions will also become
available.
<P>
Future-year emission estimates for on-road mobile sources will
most likely be more accurate as emission controls become more
efficient. As newer on-road vehicles are introduced, on-road emissions
are expected to decrease and deterioration rates will be smaller.
It is not expected that future-year on-road emissions will be
as grossly underestimated. Future AQMP revisions will reassess
the impacts of the mobile source underestimations as newer revisions
to the mobile source estimations become available.<p>
<b>Assessment of Weekend Emissions Effects</b>

<P>
In recent years ambient ozone measurements indicate a faster decrease
in Stage I episodes (days with ozone concentrations greater than
20 pphm) on weekdays compared to weekends. To address concerns
that future ozone exceedances may occur more often on weekends,
a sensitivity analysis using the June 1987 and August 1987 ozone
meteorological episodes was conducted. Since meteorology varies
independent of the day of the week, differences between weekday
and weekend emissions are likely key. During the work week, stationary
source emissions are higher as more businesses operate. Motor
vehicle emissions peak in the morning and evening rush hours.
On weekends, stationary source emissions are lower and motor vehicle
emissions build up to a plateau level sustained through much of
the day. Sufficient information to generate a weekend stationary
and area source emissions inventory are available. However, information
on on-road mobile vehicle travel patterns are not readily available.
As a sensitivity analysis, typical weekend traffic patterns (by
hour) were used to create an hourly emissions pattern for a weekend
day and a Friday traffic pattern was used to create a typical
Friday early afternoon commute traffic pattern. In addition, an
assumption that 50 percent of the heavy-duty truck emissions do
not occur on weekends was made to represent less commercial activity
on weekends. The estimated weekend inventory was used as the emissions
for the third day of the air quality simulation and the Friday
inventory was used as the second day's emissions. The results
of the sensitivity analysis show that the federal air quality
standard is still attained with the 1997 AQMP control strategy.
Further work is needed to fully quantify the weekend episode phenomena.
In addition, the field measurement program proposed for summer
1997 will provide additional information on weekend effects for
future AQMP revisions.

As discussed earlier, future carbon monoxide air quality projections
are based on a UAM analysis. A carbon monoxide meteorological
episode for 1989 was chosen for modeling as part of the 1993 Federal
Attainment Plan for Carbon Monoxide. This Plan uses the same December
6-7, 1989 episode with a recorded 1-hr carbon monoxide concentration
of 31 ppm and an 8-hr concentration of 21.8 ppm. These were the
highest recorded values over the most recent years. Table 5-3
summarizes the carbon monoxide projections by 2000 with implementation
of short- and intermediate-term control measures. Attainment of
both the federal and state carbon monoxide air quality standards
is projected in 2000 without any additional controls.

<H3><a name = "55">BASIN EMISSIONS CARRYING CAPACITY (EMISSIONS BUDGET)</H3>

<P>
The District is required to separately identify the emission reductions
and corresponding type and degree of implementation measures required
to meet federal and state ambient air quality standards. Section
40463(b) of the California State Health and Safety Code specifies
that, with the active participation of the Southern California
Association of Governments, a South Coast Air Basin emission carrying
capacity for each state and federal ambient air quality standard
shall be established by the South Coast District Board for each
formal review of the Plan and shall be updated to reflect new
data and modeling results.
<P>
A carrying capacity is defined as the maximum level of emissions
which enable the attainment and maintenance of an ambient air
quality standard for a pollutant. Emission carrying capacity for
state standards shall not be a part of the State Implementation
Plan requirements of the Clean Air Act for the South Coast Air
Basin.
<P>
Emission carrying capacity as defined in the Health and Safety
Code is an overly simplistic measure of the Basinwide allowable
emission levels for specific ambient air quality standards. It
is highly dependent on the spatial and temporal pattern of the
emissions. Because of the multicomponent nature of PM10, carrying
capacity for the contributing emittants can vary significantly.
For ozone and secondary PM10 components, the carrying capacity
is a non-linear function among their precursors.
<P>
The federal Clean Air Act requires that plans contain an emissions
budget which represents the remaining emissions levels that achieve
the applicable attainment deadline. Based on the modeling results,
a set of carrying capacities can be defined corresponding to federal
and state ambient air quality standards for carbon monoxide, nitrogen
dioxide, PM10, and ozone. VOC and oxides of nitrogen are used
for ozone. Table 5-5 shows the emissions carrying capacities for
the Basin to meet federal air quality standards. These estimates
are based on emission patterns estimated for each of the federal
attainment years (i.e., 2000 for carbon monoxide, 2006 for PM10,
and 2010 for ozone).
<H3><a name = "56">PROJECTED EMISSION TRENDS THROUGH 2010</H3>

<P>
Figures 5-14 through 5-17 show the projected emission trends for
both NOx and VOC through the year 2010. Depicted are scenarios
for the baseline cases (e.g., no further rules), and for the controlled
cases (with the 1997 AQMP Measures). Categories are described
slightly different than most emission inventory summaries in that
permitted sources (e.g., those emission sources which are permitted
with the District) are specifically delineated. These figures
show that emission levels continue to decrease through the year
2010, especially for the controlled case, when attainment with
the federal ozone standard is expected. For VOCs, emissions are
initially dominated by mobile sources, but in the later periods
area sources will become a more dominant fraction. For NOx emissions,
mobile sources are expected to be the dominant source through
the entire period.

<H3><a name = "41">INTRODUCTION</H3>

<P>
The overall control strategy in the AQMP provides the path to
achieving emission reductions and air quality goals. Implementation
of the 1997 AQMP is based on a series of control measures that
vary by source type, such as stationary or mobile, as well as
by the pollutant that is being targeted. Although great strides
have been made in air pollution control technologies, air quality
goals cannot be achieved without significant further advancements.
<P>
This chapter discusses the control measures for the 1997 AQMP
and associated emission reductions. Where appropriate, information
regarding the differences between the 1994 AQMP and the 1997 AQMP
are identified. For additional information and details on control
measures please refer to Appendix IV. For additional information
regarding baseline emission projections and estimated reductions,
please refer to Appendix III.
<H3><a name = "42">OVERALL ATTAINMENT STRATEGY</H3>

<P>
The overall control strategy for this Plan is designed to meet
applicable state and federal requirements, including attainment
with ambient air quality standards. Similar to the 1994 AQMP,
the 1997 AQMP proposes two tiers of emission reduction measures,
based on availability and readiness of technology.
<P>
Short- and intermediate-term measures propose the application
of available technologies and management practices between 1997
and the year 2005. These measures rely on known technologies and
proposed actions to be taken by several agencies that currently
have the statutory authority to implement such measures. These
measures are designed to satisfy the federal Clean Air Act requirement
of reasonably available control technologies [Section 172(c)],
and the California Clean Air Act requirements of Best Available
Retrofit Control Technologies (BARCT) [Health and Safety Code
Section 40919, Subsection C].
<P>
To ultimately achieve ambient air quality standards, additional
emissions reductions will be necessary beyond the implementation
of short- and intermediate-term measures. Long-term measures rely
on the advancement of technologies and control methods that can
reasonably be expected to occur between 2000 and 2010. These long-term
measures rely on further development and refinement of known low-
and zero-emission control technologies in addition to technological
breakthroughs.<P>
<b>Designing the Overall Strategy</b>

<P>
To develop the control strategy required in the Plan to meet state
and federal requirements, an iterative process of technology review
and ambient air quality modeling is utilized. Specifically, a
remaining emissions target is defined utilizing air quality modeling
that will achieve the ambient air quality standards. Technological
assessments are then performed to determine if specific technological
advancements can be expected to result in meeting this remaining
emissions target. Further modeling analyses are conducted using
the actual emissions reductions achieved based on the technology
review process. Ultimately an overall emissions target is determined
that achieves the ambient air quality standard and for which controls
have been defined. Figure 4-1 illustrates this iterative process
used to define the preferred control strategy.
<P>
The 1994 California Ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) control
strategy serves as the starting point to demonstrate attainment
of both federal PM10 and ozone air quality standards. If necessary,
additional controls from the 1994 comprehensive AQMP or other
alternative approaches would be added to attain the federal air
quality standards. Furthermore, these additional control measures
would be evaluated to determine consistency with potential future
air quality standards and ensure the most cost-effective path
to meet multiple clean air standards.

<b>Short- and Intermediate-term Emission Reduction Measures</b>

<P>
The 1997 AQMP includes 34 stationary and 20 mobile source control
measures. A summary of these measures is provided below. A detailed
description of the control measures is provided in Appendix IV-A:
<UL>
<LI>Section I: District's Stationary Source Control Measures
<LI>Section II:* District's Mobile Source Control Measures
<LI>Section IV: ARB Mobile Source Control Strategy
<LI>Section V: Further Study Measures
<LI>Section VI: Contingency Measures
</UL>

<P>
A description of the transportation improvement and advanced transportation
technology measures is provided in Appendix IV-B.
<P>
Short- and intermediate-term emission reduction control measures
are proposed to be implemented between 1997 and 2005. These measures
primarily rely on the traditional command and control approach
facilitated by market incentive programs to implement technological
solutions and control methods.<P>
<b>Stationary Source Control Measures</b>

<P>
Stationary controls are proposed to reduce emissions from both
point sources (permitted facilities) and area (generally small
and non-permitted) sources.
<P>
All but three stationary source control measures were previously
contained in the 1994 AQMP or the California Ozone SIP. One 1994
contingency measure for stationary sources has been placed in
the Further Studies category. Sections I and V of Appendix IV
provides detailed descriptions for each of these measures. In
addition, previously subsumed command and control measures for
coatings and solvents under the proposed VOC RECLAIM program have
now become the primary approach and are updated to reflect the
most recent technology assessment and rule implementation schedule.
Three new measures are added in the 1997 AQMP: Intercredit Trading
Program, Air Quality Investment Program and Promotion of Catalyst-Surface
Coating Technology Programs for Air Conditioning Units. These
measures are designed to enhance compliance flexibility, to facilitate
the implementation of the command and control measures. Table
4-1 provides a listing of the short- and intermediate-term stationary
source control measures.<P>
<b>Categorization of Stationary Source Control Measures</b>

<P>
Stationary source control measures in the 1997 AQMP are grouped
into 6 subcategories as described below:
<P>
Group 1 Coatings and Solvents
<P>
Group 2 Petroleum Operations, Refueling, and Fugitive VOC Emissions
<P>
Group 3 Combustion Sources
<P>
Group 4 Fugitive Dust and Miscellaneous Source Categories
<P>
Group 5 Compliance Flexibility Programs
<P>
Group 6 Long-Term Stationary Source Measures
<P>
A detailed description of the control measures in each of the
above groups is provided in Section I of Appendix IV.

Stationary Source Control Methods and Associated Emission Reductions
<P>
As previously discussed, short- and intermediate-term measures
rely on available control technologies. The control methods for
stationary sources identified in Table 4-2 below rely on a variety
of control technologies and management practices. Control technologies
vary according to the source type and pollutant being controlled
and generally include a process or physical modification such
as product reformulation, installation of air pollution control
equipment, etc. In addition, management modifications include
administrative changes such as improved housekeeping techniques,
inspection and maintenance programs, etc.

for this category is command and control regulations with additional
compliance options provided by the Intercredit Trading Program
and/or Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP). Regulated sources
have the options to: (1) apply prescribed control technology;
(2) purchase emission credits in an open market in lieu of controls;
or (3) participate in the AQIP which will in turn generate equivalent
emission reductions. The substitution measures provided in the
1994 AQMP for control measure CTS-01 - VOC RECLAIM are now combined
with CTS-02 - Control of Emissions from Solvents and Coatings.
<P>
In addition, the District is proposing to develop a series of
public awareness and education programs for small source categories.
The intent of these programs is to develop a partnership between
the District and smaller more diverse businesses to educate sources
on alternative products, techniques, processes, and equipment
modifications that can be used at their facility to reduce pollution.
Examples of potentially targeted businesses include beauty salons,
leather repair shops, and laboratories.
<P>
Included in category are two measures that will be implemented
by ARB to further reduce emissions from consumer products and
by the state Department of Pesticides Regulation (DPR) to control
pesticide emissions as originally contained in the 1994 California
Ozone SIP.<P>
<b>Petroleum Operations and Fugitive VOC Emissions</b>

<P>
This category pertains primarily to operations and materials associated
with the petroleum and chemical industries. Within this category
there are two control measures targeting fugitive VOC emissions
associated with transfer and storage of organic liquids and industrial
processes.
<P><b>Combustion Sources</b>

<P>
There are six control measures in this category, two of which
are area source credit programs designed primarily to provide
compliance flexibility and to incentivize clean technologies.
These include commercial and residential equipment and energy
conservation strategies. There is another measure for new commercial
and residential water heaters. In addition, a proposed rule for
petroleum refinery flares is being developed to first assess the
emission inventory for this source category; another rule is being
developed for the control of PM10 emissions from refinery fluid
catalytic cracking units (FCCUs); and lastly, a rule is proposed
for NOx reductions from small boilers and process heaters.
<P>
In addition, the results of technology review as required by the
District RECLAIM Rule 2015 - Backstop Provisions are incorporated
in the 1997 AQMP. The purpose of the technology review is to ensure
that the facility allocations are based on control methods that
are likely to be technologically feasible. Furthermore, proposed
changes in allocation due to further technology assessment are
reflected in the Plan to account for potential increases in emissions.
<P><b>Fugitive Dust and Miscellaneous Sources</b>

<P>
This category includes a total of 14 control measures. Ten measures
are designed for a variety of sources ranging from service-oriented
industries such as restaurants and agricultural activities, to
waste-related emissions such as livestock waste, waste burning,
and disposal of VOC-containing materials. An incentive program
is proposed to promote the use of lighter color roofing, road
materials, or tree planting. A second incentive program is proposed
to promote catalyst surface coating technologies for air conditioning
units. An in-use compliance program is also considered to ensure
the performance of air pollution control equipment. A measureregarding emissions charges for stationary sources as required
under federal law is proposed for further study to determine its
applicability and feasibility.
<H4>Fugitive Dust Control Measure Cost and Technical Feasibility
</H4>

<P>
For the 1994 PM10 Best Available Control Measures (BACM) SIP submittal,
five best available control measures were provided to control
fugitive dust emissions. As part of that submittal, the BACM SIP
committed to adopt all candidate BACM within four years of the
reclassification date (i.e., February 8, 1997) with the exception
of any measure that did not meet a specified cost and technological
feasibility criteria. The SIP revision identified the criteria
as follows:
<P>
(1-1) Cost feasibility:
<P>
A control measure will be considered cost feasible if the cost-effectiveness
is less than $5,300 per ton of PM10 reduced on an annual basis.
<P>
(1-2) Technological feasibility:
<P>
A control measure will be considered technically feasible if all
of the following conditions are satisfied:
<OL>
<LI>The control technology is currently available; and
<LI>The control efficiency has been demonstrated to achieve a
minimum of at least 10 percent.
</OL>

<P>
Table 4-3 presents a summary of the preliminary candidate BACM
cost and technological feasibility analysis. As Table 4-3 indicates,
BCM 1d/1e (curb and gutter/chemical stabilization) exceeds the
cost feasibility criteria. Table 4-3 also shows that BCM-2 (wider
use of plans) does not meet the 10 percent control efficiency
criteria. Additionally, initial studies indicate that emissions
from weed abatement activities are insignificant on a regional
scale and should be managed on a local level. Accordingly, BCM-5
(weed abatement) will not be considered as a primary control measure.
These measures are proposed to serve as contingency measures for
fugitive dust sources and are presented in Chapter 9 and Appendix
IV. As specified by CAA 172(c)(9), these PM10 contingency measures
would only become effective if the Basin fails to make reasonable
further progress or attain the NAAQS by the applicable attainment
date.

<P>
Based on the cost and technical feasibility assessment, four best
available control measures (i.e., BCM-1a, b, c, BCM-3, BCM-4 and
BCM-6) are provided in the 1997 AQMP.<P>
<b>Compliance Flexibility Programs</b>

<P>
Two control measures are proposed under this category which are
new additions to the 1997 AQMP as compared to the 1994 AQMP. The
two control measures (Intercredit Trading Program and Air Quality
Investment Program) are designed to complement command and control
measures. The primary objectives of the two measures are to enhance
regulatory compliance flexibility by providing additional compliance
options and thereby lowering compliance costs and to incentivize
early reductions and advancement of clean technologies through
emission credit banking provisions. These two measures are essential
to the successful introduction of the long-term control measures.
<P><b>Ozone Depleting Compounds</b>

<P>
As a result of worldwide concern over the destruction of the stratospheric
ozone layer, the use of certain stratospheric ozone depleting
compounds (ODCs) is scheduled to be internationally eliminated
under the Montreal Protocol.
<P>
ODCs such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane and CFC-113 are currently used
in cleaning, precision cleaning, electronics, coatings, adhesives,
aerosols, and flexible slabstock foam manufacturing in the Basin.
As part of the adoption of the Federal Reactive Organic Compounds
Rate-of-Progress Plan, the District's Governing Board directed
staff to consider the impacts on the urban ozone problem from
the replacement of ODCs with VOC-containing materials.
<P>
In 1992 an ODC Working Group comprised of representatives from
the District, ARB, EPA, industry, and other interested parties
was established to evaluate the impact of a potential VOC increase
resulting from elimination of ODCs. The ODC Working Group developed
substitution estimates based on categories of usage and types
of processes. In January 1996, the District prepared &quot;Ozone
Depleting Compounds Replacement Guidelines&quot; to facilitate
the transition from ODCs to substances that are the most environmentally
benign. Based on the estimates provided in the guideline document,
an additional 11 tons/day of VOC is projected by the year 2010
as compared to the baseline projections discussed in Chapter 3.
An adjustment has been made in the remaining emissions inventory
to account for these future year emission increases, which are
subject to District review at the time of conversion to comply
with the criteria established by the guideline document.<P>
<b>On-Road Mobile Source Control Measures</b>

<P>
On-road motor vehicles, which include passenger cars, light-duty
trucks, medium-duty vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, and motorcycles,
currently number approximately 10 million in the South Coast Air
Basin. In 1995, these vehicles traveled more than 300 million
miles per day, and by the year 2010, vehicle miles traveled is
projected to be about 380 million miles per day. ARB and U.S.
EPA have primary authority to control mobile source emissions
through the adoption of emission standards and other related requirements;
whereas the District has more limited authority to reduce emissions
from these sources.
<P>
The 1997 AQMP includes seven on-road mobile source control measures.
Two measures are proposed for District implementation, four measures
are provided for ARB implementation, and one control measure is
proposed for U.S. EPA implementation. The two District on-road
control measures are new to the 1997 AQMP, and are voluntary,
market-based measures, while the remaining control measures are
from the 1994 California Ozone SIP. Table 4-4 summarizes the on-road
vehicle control measures, using traditional command and control
as well as market based approaches.

<P>
Technology-Based Control Measures
<P>
In the past, the control of on-road vehicle emissions was achieved
primarily from the adoption of more stringent emission standards.
The most significant action that has taken place in pursuing this
approach was the adoption of the Low-Emission Vehicle and Clean
Fuels regulations by ARB in September 1990. This regulation established
stringent tailpipe standards and mandated low-emission vehicle
sales for the years 1994 through 2003. This regulation is applicable
for passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles,
and its principal requirements are summarized as follows:
<UL>
<LI>establishes vehicle emission standards that will require additional
VOC and NOx emission reductions of approximately 80 percent and
50 percent, respectively, compared to 1994 emission standards;
<LI>requires the sale of zero-emission vehicles beginning in 2003;
<LI>allows the use of vehicles powered by alternative fuels; and
<LI>requires the widespread availability of alternative fuels,
based on the number of alternative-fueled vehicles produced by
automobile manufacturers.
</UL>

<P>
The 1997 AQMP, consistent with 1994 AQMP, includes a control measure
that proposes ARB adoption of emission standards that are more
stringent than existing low-emission vehicle requirements, to
continue the progress in reducing passenger car and light-duty
truck emissions for the post 2003 timeframe. This is based on
the development of cost-effective gasoline engine control technology,
along with anticipated advancements in electric vehicle battery
technology and supporting infrastructure. With regard to medium-duty
vehicles, it is proposed that the current requirements applicable
for the 1998 to 2002 timeframe be modified by ARB to accelerate
the in-use penetration of low-emission vehicles and ultra-low
emission medium-duty vehicles. Again, carryover this proposal
from the previous plan is based on assumptions regarding expected
advancements in light-duty vehicle emission control technology
that would be applicable for the medium-duty vehicle sector.
<P>
With regard to heavy-duty vehicles, the approach for further reducing
emissions depends on whether the vehicles are powered with gasoline
or diesel fuel. For gasoline-fueled heavy-duty vehicles, ARB proposes
to obtain oxides of nitrogen and VOC emission reductions by lowering
emission standards, through the application of emission control
technology (i.e., utilization of three-way catalytic converters)
that is already well established for light-duty vehicles. For
diesel-powered heavy-duty vehicles, ARB is proposing a combination
of strategies in an overall effort to maximize the utilization
of very low NOx emitting engines in California trucking fleets.
These strategies include the adoption by ARB of more stringent
NOx emission standards, effective for the post 2002 timeframe,
as well as U.S. EPA adoption of correspondingly stringent nationwide
oxides of nitrogen emission standards for the post 2004 timeframe.
U.S. EPA action in this area is particularly important since a
significant amount of diesel-fueled heavy-duty vehicles operating
in California are powered with federally certified engines.
<P><b>Market-Based/Incentive Strategies</b>

<P>
The 1994 AQMP included a number of market-based control measures
that have been adopted in 1995 as District Rules 1612 and 1620.
These include MON-01 - Emissions Reduction Credit for Low-Emission
Retrofit Fleet Vehicles, MON-05 - Emissions Reduction Credit for
Heavy-Duty Buses, and MON-06 - Emissions Reduction Credit for
Heavy-Duty Trucks. In continuing this approach to reduce mobile
source emissions, the 1997 AQMP includes several market-based/incentive
control measures targeting the light- and heavy-duty vehicle sectors.
With regard to District implementation, it is proposed that mobile
source emission reduction credits be issued for certain strategies
that will produce emission reductions surplus to existing or planned
requirements, such as truck stop electrification and the use of
fuel additives.
<P>
The 1997 AQMP also includes market-based/incentive control measures
for ARB implementation. Specifically, it is proposed that ARB
adopt regulations implementing a 75,000 vehicle per year accelerated
retirement program for light-duty vehicles beginning in 1999 (Control
Measure M1), with a smaller pilot-scale program to be implemented
in the 1996 to 1998 timeframe. The oldest, highest-emitting vehicles
would be targeted for this program. It is also proposed that a
similar strategy be implemented for heavy-duty diesel trucks (Control
Measure M7), targeting the accelerated retirement of 1,600 vehicles,
using the same implementation dates as the light-duty vehicle
accelerated retirement program. Finally, a market incentive rule,
to be implemented by ARB and/or the District, is proposed with
the objective of accelerating the penetration of low-NOx heavy-duty
engines in local trucking fleets. This would occur in the 1996
to 2002 timeframe, prior to the implementation of revised oxides
of nitrogen emission standards for heavy-duty engines.
<P><b>Off-Road Mobile Source Control Measures</b>

<P>
Off-road mobile sources refer to off-road vehicles and mobile
non-vehicular equipment categories such as aircraft, trains, marine
vessels, farm and construction equipment (e.g., bulldozers), industrial
equipment (e.g., forklifts), and utility equipment (e.g., lawn
mowers). The authority to develop and implement regulations for
off-road mobile sources lies primarily with the U.S. EPA, ARB,
and to a lesser extent with the District.
<P>
The 1997 AQMP includes a total of six off-road mobile source control
measures. Four measures are based on U.S. EPA implementation,
one measure is provided for ARB implementation, and one control
measure is provided for District implementation. The District
control measure is new to the 1997 AQMP and is a voluntary market-based
measure. The remaining control measures represent control measures
from the 1994 California Ozone SIP and target mandatory emission
limits for certain types of off-road equipment categories. Table
4-4 provides a list of the off-road mobile source measures.
<P>
Because of practical and legal considerations, the majority of
control measures for off-road mobile sources focus on the U.S.
EPA adoption of nationwide emission standards. Control measures
proposing emission standards for new aircraft engines, as well
as new and rebuilt and locomotive engines target U.S. EPA or other
federal agencies implementation, since the federal government
has sole authority over these emission sources. For the same reason,
U.S. EPA implementation is assigned to control measures that propose
more stringent emission standards for diesel powered off-road
industrial equipment, and gasoline and LPG powered industrial
equipment from 25 to 175 horsepower. (It should be noted that
industrial equipment can include emission sources that are categorized
under the farm and construction equipment category above and below
175 horsepower. Since U.S. EPA has sole authority for farm and
construction equipment below 175 horsepower, separate control
measures targeting industrial equipment have been included based
on whether implementation would be assigned to ARB or U.S. EPA.)
<P>
A control measure proposing nationwide emission standards implemented
by U.S. EPA, in conjunction with international standards, is also
the most viable approach for reducing marine vessel emissions
since many of these vessels are not based in California or the
United States. Finally, nationwide emission standards for pleasure
craft are being proposed since manufacturers would have a larger
market base to promote the development of emission control technology.
As a backstop strategy, ARB would act to adopt emission standards
(where legally permitted) for off-road emission sources if U.S.
EPA fails to adopt nationwide standards.
<P>
The District's new market-based control measure proposes the issuance
of mobile source emission reduction credits for programs that
accelerate the replacement of existing pleasure craft engines
with new lower-polluting engines. These programs would be voluntarily
implemented and would provide industry with more flexible and
potentially more cost-effective approaches in complying with District
emission reduction requirements.
<P><b>Transportation Control Measures</b>

<P>
One transportation control measure (TCM), five advanced transportation
technology (ATT) measures, and one further study strategy measure
(FSS) have been included in the 1997 AQMP and are listed in Table
4-4.
<P>
Specific performance based transportation standards were replaced
by 1996 state legislation. Recent federal and state legislation
provides for alternative control approaches which can achieve
equivalent emission reductions to the AVO-based programs to be
developed in place of commuter rideshare programs. District Rule
2202 was adopted in December 1995 to provide the mechanism for
employers of 100 employees or more to achieve targeted emission
reductions through a menu of control options approach. The emission
reductions obtained through Rule 2202 implementation are currently
included as part of the baseline emissions inventory estimates.
Upcoming efforts to replace Rule 2202, as called for in SB 836
(Lewis) through voluntary rideshare programs or other means, are
to be based on actions that provide surplus, real and quantifiable
emission reductions equivalent to those that would have otherwise
occurred under Rule 2202. Thus, the full emission reduction attributable
to Rule 2202 will be achieved and is accounted for in the 1997
AQMP.<P>
<b>Control Measure Development</b>

<P>
Several policy committees as well as local governments submitted
recommendations to SCAG and the District regarding control measure
development and implementation for the 1994 AQMP. These included:
the TCM Policy Committee; Advanced Transportation Technology (ATT)
Task Force; Market Incentives Task Force; Regional Railroad Air
Quality Emission Reduction Board; and Subregional Organizations.
In addition, the SCAG Regional Council recommended that the proposed
transportation control measures be included as part of the 1994
AQMP. These measures and recommendations have been moved forward
and included in the 1997 AQMP.<P>
<b>Control Method Objectives</b>

<P>
The status of the objectives for the implementation of the 1994
AQMP developed by the Transportation Committees and Task Forces
are as follows: a delegation and substitution process, to allow
delegation for implementation of regional indirect source rules
and/or substitution of local implementation plans or measures
for requirements of District rules, has been developed and approved
by the Governing Board; however, since future ISRs, have not been
incorporated in the 1997 AQMP, the delegation substitution process
relative to these rules is also not incorporated in this Plan.
The delegation substitution process is still available for any
future regional transportation rule. The process is described
in greater detail in Appendix IV-B. The Partnership to accelerate
implementation of advanced transportation technologies has been
implemented and is proceeding with the implementation of the ATTs
included in the 1994 AQMP; and the REACH Task Force has been convened
and is in the process of developing market-based solutions to
regional transportation and air quality problems. The current
proposal from the REACH Task Force is included in the 1997 AQMP
as a further study strategy measure.
<P><b>Control Methods</b>

<P>
A list of control methods for transportation control measures
is summarized in Table 4-5. As shown below, control methods are
categorized into three groupings: advanced transportation technologies,
transportation improvements, and a further study strategy.

<b>Emission Reductions from Short- and Intermediate-Term Control
Measures</b>

<P>
Short and intermediate-term control measures potentially available
for implementation by 2005 were identified and to the extent possible
quantified. These quantified measures were modeled to determine
their effectiveness in meeting the attainment goals. For stationary
point sources, measures were quantified for equipment and industry
categories which are more detailed than quantifying measures based
in large part on equipment categories. Appendix III provides a
more detailed discussion of the emissions inventories for the
South Coast Air Basin, and emission estimation techniques used
for quantifying reductions for the 1997 AQMP.
<P>
A summary of emission reductions available by the year 2000 for
short- and intermediate-term measures is provided in Tables 4-6
through 4-8. Emission reductions represent the difference between
the projected baseline and the remaining emissions. In addition,
the tables identify projected reductions based on the summer planning
inventory for VOC and NOx emissions; the winter planning inventory
for CO and NOx emissions; and the annual average inventory for
SOx and PM10 emissions. The CO emission reductions in 2000 represent
the level of control needed to achieve the federal CO standard.

<H3><a name = "43">LONG-TERM EMISSION REDUCTION MEASURES</H3>

<P>
Previous AQMPs showed that achievement of ambient air quality
standards will require additional emission reductions beyond the
implementation of short- and intermediate-term control measures.
Historically, the AQMP has emphasized and relied upon the continual
need to deploy advanced air pollution control technologies and
cleaner fuels to ultimately achieve air quality goals. In the
1994 AQMP, emissions reduction targets were established for the
remaining emissions after implementation of short- and intermediate-term
controls. These targets, referred to as long-term or Section 182(e)(5)
control measures, were based on the application of advanced technologies
and additional market incentives and operational measures. The
1997 AQMP reached similar conclusions and proposed to further
reduce emissions through measures that are based on specific technological
advancements and control methods that can be reasonably expected
to be implemented and in use by the year 2010. These technologies
and control methods cannot be fully implemented today; however,
recent promising advancements suggest that such technologies could
be commercially viable and implemented over the next 13 years.<P>
<b>Section 182(e)(5) Control Measures</b>

<P>
Section 182(e)(5) of the federal Clean Air Act allows extreme
ozone nonattainment areas to develop control measures which rely
on anticipated development of new control techniques or improvement
of existing control technologies. An enforceable commitment to
develop and adopt contingency measures, to be implemented should
the proposed control measures fail to meet stated emission reductions,
must be made. Contingency measures for the Section 182(e)(5) measures
must be submitted to the U.S. EPA no later than three years before
proposed implementation of the Section 182(e)(5) measures.
<P>
Many of the long-term emission reduction measures which rely on
technologies that are not fully developed for commercial use (such
as fuel cells, hydrogen engines, and fly-wheel batteries) are
considered as meeting Section 182(e)(5) requirements. Other measures
such as market-incentive programs which promote the advancement
of new technologies, or long-term measures which rely on improving
existing control technologies and have future compliance dates
beyond 2000, are also considered as part of the Section 182(e)(5)
control measures.
<P>
The U.S. EPA approved the Section 182(e)(5) measures in the 1994
California Ozone SIP. The long-term measures listed in Table 4-9
are those provided in the 1994 California Ozone SIP and serve
as the Section 182(e)(5) control measures for the 1997 AQMP. Many
of the District and Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review
Committee (MSRC) programs and the associated fundings are intended
to demonstrate new technologies for the long-term measures listed
in Table 4-9, some of which are discussed in this chapter. When
the new advanced technology demonstrations are completed, an assessment
is performed to determine the feasibility of the advanced technology.
If the technology is feasible, future rule development will be
undertaken to realize the emission reductions associated with
the long-term measures. Thus, the advanced technology projects
funded by the District and the MSRC are an important and necessary
process in order to ensure the realization of advanced technologies
within the next 13 years.
<P>
As part of its action on the 1994 California Ozone SIP, an &quot;additional
measures&quot; approach was provided by ARB to achieve further
mobile source emission reductions. No specific control approaches
were identified with the adoption of the California Ozone SIP.
However, many of the advanced technology projects under the District's
sponsorship could be feasible by the mid-2000s and would complement
the market-based approaches for these additional measures.
<P>
The advanced technologies proposed for implementation in this
Plan are based largely on the projects funded or co-funded by
the District's Technology Advancement Office (TAO), as well as
projects funded by MSRC which was established in 1990 with the
adoption of Assembly Bill 2766. The primary purpose of TAO is
to conduct public-private research, development, and demonstration
projects in order to identify and promote low- and zero-emissions
technologies for both mobile and stationary sources. The District
has developed a Technology Advancement Plan to comply with recent
Legislative requirements. This plan, which will be updated periodically
to be as responsive as possible to technological advances, is
available upon request and includes an overview of the TAO program,
project planning and selection processes, and proposed project
areas.
<P>
The primary purpose of AB 2766 is to ensure that District's and,
in the Basin, local governments implementing CCAA have access
to the funds necessary to implement the California Clean Air Act
(CCAA) of 1988. In addition, a fund of monies set aside to obtain
emission reductions from mobile sources through a grant program
developed by MSRC. To this end, MSRC funding can be used solely
for projects to reduce air pollution from motor vehicles.
<P>
Some of the key technological advancements resulting from the
District and MSRC programs are highlighted and reviewed below.
A 1995 report entitled &quot;Building Markets for Low-Emission
Technologies and Clean Fuels: A Status Report on Commercialization
and Technology Transfer,&quot; which provides more detailed information
on District-funded technologies, is available upon request.
<P><b>Multiple Application Advanced Technologies</b>
<P>
<b>Fuel Cells /Advanced Battery Technologies</b>

<P>
Advanced zero and near-zero emission technologies (such as fuel
cells) are needed to help meet the District's air quality goals
by the year 2010. If deployed on a large scale, such technologies
can achieve substantial air pollution reductions for a wide spectrum
of stationary and mobile sources.
<P>
Fuel cells are devices that electrochemically convert hydrogen
and oxygen into electricity and pure water, with little or no
emissions. Most fuel cell systems obtain oxygen from ambient air.
Hydrogen can be generated through catalytic steam reforming of
a hydrogen-rich fuel such as methanol or natural gas. Fuel cells
and batteries offer similar advantages over internal combustion
engines, including zero or near-zero emissions, high fuel efficiency,
good power, few moving parts, and low noise. A key difference
is that unlike batteries, fuel cells can provide continuous operation
because they generate power from an external fuel supply. Thus,
fuel cell electric vehicles offer comparable driving range and
refueling time to today's gasoline vehicles, while battery-electric
vehicles must be recharged over the course of several hours from
the electrical grid.
<P>
Fuel cells are currently being developed for a wide variety of
applications, and the District's technology advancement program
has played a leading role towards expediting their commercialization.
For example, the District has formed and convened a Fuel Cell
Implementation Task Force to help develop incentives for the manufacture
of fuel cell technologies. The District is working with the federal
government and various private-sector entities to expedite commercialization
of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells in transit buses
and automobiles. As a follow-up to a District-co-funded project,
by late 1997 one fuel cell manufacturer will deploy 10 prototype
PEM fuel cell buses in revenue service at three North American
cities. The manufacturer has now achieved diesel-equivalent power
density in its fuel cell powerplant for buses and cars, and is
projecting commercialization of PEM fuel cell buses by 2000. Virtually
all the major automobile manufacturers are working on fuel cell
passenger cars, and two have announced their intention to conduct
pre-production demonstrations of PEM fuel cell cars within the
next five years. The District is also working with the federal
government to develop methanol-fueled phosphoric acid fuel cell
transit buses. This prototype technology is now being optimized
and scaled up, with prospects for commercialization by about 2005.
<P>
Progress with fuel cells for stationary applications is also proceeding
steadily. Since the District became the first commercial site
for a 200kW PC-25 Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC) unit for stationary
power, more than 70 units are on order or have gone on line around
the world. Units installed between 1993 and 1994 have logged more
than 7,500 hours continuously, with an average availability exceeding
95 percent. Operating efficiency, in terms of thermal input (lower
heating value of natural gas) to electrical output, has averaged
40 percent. Measured emissions are so low that the District has
exempted these powerplants from all air quality permitting requirements
in the greater Los Angeles basin. Noise levels are also extremely
low. The latest version of this PAFC technology, the PC 25C, is
lighter, smaller, and costs about 40 percent less (from $5000
per kW to $3000 per kW). The target cost, at which the PC-25 sales
are expected to be self-sustaining, is $1,500 per kW. The manufacturer's
aim is to achieve this cost target by the end of 1998 through
increased production and sales.
<P>
According to a report sponsored by the ARB, entitled, &quot;Performance
and Availability of Batteries for Electric Vehicles: A Report
of the Battery Technical Advisory Panel,&quot; dated December
11, 1995, improved lead-acid and nickel cadmium batteries will
be used in electric vehicles in the near future. However, a variety
of advanced battery technologies which will provide greater vehicle
range are being developed for use in production electric vehicles
during the 2000 to 2001 timeframe and beyond. Some of the most
notable technologies include nickel-metal-hydride, lithium-ion,
and sodium-nickel-chloride. Honda and Toyota have announced they
will introduce pilot fleets of electric vehicles with nickel-metal-hydride
batteries in 1998. Refuelable zinc-air battery systems which provide
long vehicle range are also being developed.
<P>
In July 1995, the MSRC created the &quot;Quick Charge&quot; program,
intended as a large-scale pilot demonstration of electric vehicles
within the jurisdiction of the District during 1996, 1997, and
1998. This demonstration will aid local communities, manufacturers,
and utilities to test the consumer market and demonstrate the
infrastructure, permitting processes, and coordination that would
be necessary for the eventual introduction of larger quantities
of electric vehicles. The pilot demonstration seeks to identify
and resolve potential barriers to broad electric vehicle commercialization.
Among the various issues to be addressed are the following: battery
recycling, charging methods, codes and standards, consumer education
and training, emergency response training, equipment availability,
electric vehicle service capability, fast charging, home charging,
incentives, permitting, remote charging, utility capacity, and
utility electric rates.
<P>
Concurrently, the MSRC has initially allocated revenues to be
leveraged with local funding to create &quot;Quick Charge&quot;
electric vehicle corridor communities. This program supports the
deployment of electric vehicles along designated freeway corridors
and within specific communities that have committed to be electric
vehicle ready. Local government will play a critical role in permitting
and inspection, adopting codes and ordinances, and providing public
recharging infrastructure.
<P><b>Alternative Fuels</b>

<P>
Significant advancements have been made in the development and
use of alternative clean fuels for a variety of on- and off-road
mobile sources as well as stationary source applications. Alternative
fuel technologies for on-road sources include methanol, ethanol,
propane, compressed natural gas and electricity. Numerous District
and MSRC projects have demonstrated the viability of each of these
fuels. While progress has been made, further advancements or infrastructure
are required for full commercialization.
<P>
Emission reductions can be expected from light-duty off-road engines
based on zero- or near-zero-emission technologies such as electric
or battery-powered equipment or fuel cell-powered units. These
technologies are expected to eventually be used for the majority
of light-duty off-road equipment (e.g., pumps, compressors, and
forklifts). For heavy-duty off-road engines (i.e., &gt; 50 hp),
advanced alternative fuel technologies can also be relied upon
to achieve additional emissions reductions.
<P>
Many activities of the District program are directed at crediting
commercialization of alternative fuel vehicles that are fully
certified and warranted under state regulations for light- and
medium-duty vehicles. In January 1994, the ARB certified a 1994
Chrysler natural gas minivan to meet the stringent ultra low-emission
vehicle (ULEV) emission standards. The Dodge Caravans and Plymouth
Voyagers were certified to less than half of the nonmethane organic
gas (NMOG) standard, one-sixth of the CO standard, and one-tenth
of the NOx standard. These front-wheel drive vehicles are equipped
with a 3.3 liter V-6 engine using a three-way catalytic converter,
heated oxygen sensor, and sequential multi-port natural gas fuel
injection system
<P>
Retail sale of ARB-certified methanol transitional low-emission
vehicles (TLEV) has followed several years of strategically targeted
demonstration programs, with co-funding from the District program,
to address key commercialization barriers.
<P>
To date, there are no light- or medium-duty propane vehicles certified
to ARB low-emission vehicle standards. Working both with original
equipment manufacturers and aftermarket companies, the District
program has sponsored projects designed to advance the state of
the art in low-emission propane vehicles.
<P>
Hydrogen also offers an extremely good option. It can substantially
eliminate a range of criteria, toxic, and global-warming pollutants
by significantly reducing tailpipe, refueling, and evaporative
emissions. In addition, since it can be made from water and is
recyclable, its supply is potentially inexhaustible.
<P>
The fuel can be used in dedicated or hybrid internal combustion
engines, or in fuel cells. Ballard and Mercedes-Benz have already
made substantial progress in developing hydrogen powered fuel
cell vehicles. However, the entry of such vehicles into the marketplace
is constrained due to a complete absence of a hydrogen fueling
infrastructure. However, ARB LEV requirements mandate the establishment
of alternate fuel outlets if vehicle sales, propelled by a particular
fuel, reach 20,000 or more.
<P><b>Renewable Power Generation Technologies</b>

<P>
Several technologies are on the horizon that involve the production
of fuel for mobile or stationary applications from renewable energy
sources. Some technologies that have been demonstrated either
through the efforts of the District and MSRC, or by others include:
use of photovoltaics to recharge electric vehicles; generation
of hydrogen through electrolysis of water which can be utilized
for mobile or stationary applications; and generation of electricity
with a solar concentrator in combination with a Stirling engine
system.<P>
<b>Advanced Mobile and Transportation Technologies</b>
<P>
<b>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) </b>

<P>
In recent years, many technological advances have occurred in
making the vehicle and the highway more intelligent, mostly in
order to improve traffic. Several technologies are considered
part of the general category of ITS including: traffic signal
synchronization; interchangeable message signs; traveler information
systems; automatic course finders; variable ramp metering; automatic
fee collection systems; and vehicle platooning systems. The District
is a major participant in the planning and development of various
elements of ITS.
<P><b>Remote Sensing Devices</b>

<P>
Remote sensing devices (RSDs) are instruments capable of measuring
instantaneous concentrations of pollutants in the exhaust of vehicles.
These devices have been in the development stages for several
years and are now commercially available for use. The District
and others have been extensively involved in the research, development
and application of RSDs.
<P>
In recent years, major advancements have been made in the technical
capabilities of the devices such as the ability to measure volatile
organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide. In
addition, a program funded by the District demonstrated that RSDs
can be used to detect high-emitting vehicles, and that most of
these vehicles can be repaired at an acceptable cost.
<P><b>Advanced Add-On Control Technologies</b>

<P>
Significant research is in progress to advance control technologies
for on-road motor vehicles. For gasoline vehicles, improvements
in three-way catalytic converter technology (such as the utilization
of greater catalyst loadings, improved wash coats, and electrically
heated catalysts) have shown the potential to further reduce volatile
organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen emissions by more than
80 and 50 percent, respectively. Improvements in fuel management
techniques, in an effort to maintain stoichiometric air fuel mixtures
during warm engine operating conditions, have also been responsible
for substantial reductions in vehicle emissions. These techniques
include sequential fuel injection, dual oxygen sensor systems,
and adaptive transient control. These technologies are transferable
to off-road mobile source applications as well as to the existing
on-road vehicle fleet whose emission control systems have deteriorated
or are of less advanced design.
<P>
Relative to diesel-powered vehicles, it is anticipated that improvements
in NOx reduction technologies will occur in the areas of lean
NOx catalysts and exhaust gas circulation. In addition, alternative
fuels such as methanol and natural gas, used in diesel engine
applications, have shown the potential to reduce NOx emissions
by more than 50 percent. Again, these technologies are expected
to be transferable to off-road mobile source applications.<P>
<b>Stationary and Area Source Technologies</b>

<P>
Appendix IV-A of the 1997 AQMP provides a more detailed discussion
of each long-term measure including a description of the source
category, potential control technologies, and implementation milestones.
<P><b>Zero-VOC Coating Formulations </b>

<P>
Significant advancements have been made relative to the development
and application of zero- or near-zero-VOC coating formulations.
Powder coatings, UV coatings for various substrates, zero-VOC
interior flat architectural coating materials, as well as waterborne
lacquers for wood products, are examples of technological advancements
that have developed over the last 5 to 10 years. The source categories
subject to the long-term control measures include architectural
coatings, solvent degreasing and cleaning operations and miscellaneous
industrial coating operations. The focus of the long-term control
measures for these source categories is primarily the small and
unpermitted sources. Therefore, in addition to control technologies,
innovative implementation mechanism is also needed to successfully
carry out the control program.<P>
<b>Zero-VOC Consumer Products</b>

<P>
Haircare products, deodorants and laundry cleaning materials are
examples of products that contain VOCs. The use of these products
represents a significant source of emissions. Lower VOC containing
products have been developed, in part due to the California consumer
products regulations. Further development and use of less-polluting
products are key technological advancements proposed in this Plan.<P>
<b>Fugitive Emissions</b>

<P>
Fugitive emissions from industrial processes, chemical plants,
refineries, and oil and gas production sources, or transfer and
storage of organic materials contribute to overall VOC emissions.
Efficient and cost-effective technologies such as enhanced inspection
and maintenance program, leakless valves, or vapor recovery device
are critical to support further reductions from fugitive emission
source categories.
<P><b>Miscellaneous Sources</b>

<P>
This source category represented many small and unspecified emission
sources and yet in aggregate a significant contribution to the
overall emissions. Development of an emission reduction strategy,
first requires a better emission inventory to identify specific
sources of emissions. Applicable controls or innovative controls
can then be developed in conjunction with better management practices
and effective regulatory programs to reduce emissions.
<P><b>Emission Reduction Targets</b>

<P>
Table 4-9 lists long-term or 182(e)(5) measures calling for advanced
technologies. It represents the emission reduction targets beyond
the short- and intermediate-measures.<P>
<b>Alternative Control Approaches</b>

<P>
Spatial and temporal emission reduction programs offer a potentially
viable method of<STRIKE> </STRIKE>reducing ambient concentrations
of atmospheric pollutants. These methods are described below and
will continue to be further evaluated in the future.
<P>
An alternative to the application of the long-term advanced control
technologies described above, or an in-concert approach, is the
selective reduction of sources in certain geographical zones in
the Basin. Advanced technologies and control practices could be
targeted for those areas of the Basin that contribute more significantly
to the exceedances of the ambient air quality standards than other
areas. Under this approach, further advanced control zones would
be identified and programs developed.
<P>
The District has evaluated the potential viability of spatial
and temporal approaches. As part of its analysis for the Environmental
Impact Report for the 1994 AQMP, the District developed a control
strategy based on the proposed control program as set forth in
the 1994 AQMP, but applied the long-term VOC stationary source
measures in the western portion of the Basin only.

<P>
The District found that a long-term strategy based on such an
approach can provide equivalent air quality benefits, achieving
all of the ambient air quality standards within the same timeframe
as the 1994 AQMP. Moreover, since the use of such approaches narrows
the degree of control in the Basin, they can significantly reduce
the cost of the Plan.
<P>
This analysis represented the District's first step toward developing
a comprehensive control strategy. Further analysis was needed
to define the specific geographic zones in the Basin. However,
the necessary quantitative tools were not available.
<P>
As part of the development of the 1997 AQMP, the District sponsored
a study to develop an ozone assessment tool which provides the
contribution from various source regions to ozone exceedances.
An alternative control approach is provided as part of the Environmental
Impact Report for the 1997 AQMP. While the appropriate assessment
tools are now available, further evaluations of the specific geographic
zones are needed to fully address the socioeconomic impacts of
geographic controls.
<P><b>Temporal/Seasonal Reduction Programs</b>

<P>
In addition to spatial reduction programs and long-term advanced
technologies, reduction efforts could be directed at the time
of release of emissions. Under this approach, selective source
emissions in the Basin could be shifted to hours that would be
less conducive to forming photochemical pollutants and to seasons
with less photochemical activity. One of the proposals of the
Intercredit Trading Program is to allow VOC stationary sources
to shift emissions-related activities to the winter season from
the summer ozone season. The Environmental Impact Report for the
1997 AQMP provides an analysis of the air quality impacts of this
alternative control approach.
<H3><a name = "44">OVERALL EMISSION REDUCTIONS</H3>

<P>
A summary of emission reductions available by the years 2006 and
2010 for short-, intermediate- and long-term measures is provided
in Tables 4-10 through 4-13. Emission reductions represent the
difference between the projected baseline and the remaining emissions.
For 2006, Table 4-10 identifies projected reductions based on
the annual average inventory for all criteria pollutants (VOC,
NOx, CO, SOx, and PM10). It represents the level of emission reductions
needed to achieve the federal PM10 standards. For 2010, Tables
4-11 through 4-13 identify projected reductions based on the summer
planning inventory for VOC and NOx emissions, the winter planning
inventory for CO and NOx emissions, and the annual average inventory
for SOx and PM10 emissions. Emission reductions by 2010 illustrate
the extent of controls needed for achieving the federal ozone
standard.

<h3><a name = "21">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<P>
In this chapter, 1995 air quality in the South Coast Air Basin
(Basin), and in the portions of the Mojave Desert and Salton Sea
Air Basins (MDAB/SSAB) monitored by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District (District), is compared to state and federal
ambient air quality standards. (The MDAB and SSAB were part of
the Southeast Desert Air Basin or SEDAB until May 30, 1996, when
the California Air Resources Board adopted the boundaries and
names of the two new air basins.) For those pollutants which exceeded
federal standards, maps which compare 1995 air quality in different
areas of the Basin have been included.
<P>
Nationwide air quality for 1994 is also briefly summarized in
this chapter. A comparison of air quality in the Basin to other
U.S. and California urban areas is presented in the following
pages.
<H3><a name = "22">AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS</H3>

<P>
Ambient air quality standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen
dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter (PM10), and lead have
been set by both the California state and federal governments.
The state has also set standards for sulfate and visibility. The
ambient air quality standards for each of these pollutants and
their effects on health are summarized in Table 2-1.
<P>
In 1995 the Basin exceeded the federal standards for ozone, carbon
monoxide, and PM10 on a total of 116 days. In recent years the
Basin has recorded many more days exceeding the federal standards
than any other area of the U.S.
<H3><a name = "23"> COMPARISON TO OTHER U.S. AREAS</H3>

<P>
The Basin's severe air pollution problem is a consequence of the
combination of emissions from the nation's second largest urban
area and especially adverse meteorological conditions. The average
wind speed for Los Angeles is the lowest of the nation's ten largest
urban areas. In addition, the summertime maximum mixing height
(an index of how well pollutants can be dispersed vertically in
the atmosphere) in Southern California averages the lowest in
the U.S. The Southern California area is also an area with abundant
sunshine, which drives the photochemical reactions which form
pollutants such as ozone.

In the Basin, exceedances of the federal ozone standard are recorded
largely during the spring to early fall months. By contrast, exceedances
of the federal carbon monoxide standard occur in late fall and
winter. Exceedances of the federal 24-hour PM10 standard can occur
throughout the year, but occur most frequently in fall and winter.
Although there are changes in emissions by season, the observed
variations in pollutant concentrations are largely a result of
seasonal differences in weather conditions.
<P>
In 1995, the federal standard for ozone was exceeded at one or
more Basin locations on 27 percent of days and the federal carbon
monoxide standard was exceeded on 4 percent of days. The federal
PM10 standard was exceeded on 10 percent of the days sampled.1
<P>
Figure 2-1 shows maximum pollutant concentrations in 1994 for
the South Coast Air Basin compared to other urban areas in the
U.S. and California. Maximum concentrations in these other large
U.S. urban areas exceeded the federal ozone and PM10 standards
in some instances, and did not exceed the carbon monoxide standard.
However several other areas in the country did report exceedances
of the carbon monoxide standard. In California, some of the other
large urban areas also exceeded the PM10 and ozone standards,
but did not exceed the carbon monoxide standard.
<P>
The maximum second highest 1-hour average ozone concentration
in the Basin was nearly twice the federal standard. New York and
Houston exceeded by much less of a margin, and Philadelphia and
Washington barely exceeded, while Chicago did not exceed the standard.
Though New York is a much larger urban area than Houston, the
maximum ozone concentration for Houston equaled that of New York.
Houston, like Los Angeles, is an area with abundant sunshine which
creates favorable conditions for the photochemical reactions that
yield ozone and other photochemical pollutants. In California,
San Francisco did not exceed the ozone standard, while the San
Diego, Sacramento and Oxnard-Ventura metropolitan areas each exceeded
the standard. Both the San Diego and Oxnard-Ventura metropolitan
areas are subject to higher ozone levels due to transport from
the South Coast Air Basin.
<P>
The maximum 8-hour average carbon monoxide concentration in the
Basin was over one and a half times the federal standard. The
standard was not exceeded in the other major urban areas depicted
in Figure 2-1 in this comparison.
<P>
Maximum annual average PM10 concentrations recorded in the Basin,
New York, and Philadelphia exceeded the federal PM10 standard,
and San Diego exceeded very narrowly. Only Philadelphia recorded
a higher PM10 than the Basin, as a consequence of nearby stationary
source emissions.

In 1994, no location in the Basin or any other area of the U.S.
exceeded the nitrogen dioxide standard. The Los Angeles County
portion of the Basin was the last area of the U.S. to exceed the
standard, but has remained in compliance since 1991. Sulfur dioxide
concentrations in the Basin continued to remain well below federal
standards, and were lower than those in the urban areas of the
Eastern U.S. Concentrations of sulfur dioxide in urban areas in
the Eastern U.S. have generally been higher than those in the
Basin due to the use of fuels such as coal which have relatively
high sulfur content.

Figure 2-2 shows the maximum pollutant concentrations for 1995
as percentages of the state and federal standards. The maximum
ozone concentration exceeded the federal standard by the widest
margin, with a maximum 1-hour average (0.26 ppm recorded in the
Central San Bernardino Mountain area) that was 200 percent of
the federal standard. The highest 8-hour average carbon monoxide
concentration recorded (13.86 ppm in the South Central Los Angeles
County area) was 146 percent of the federal carbon monoxide standard.
The maximum 24-hour average PM10 (219 &#181;g/m3 in the Metropolitan
Riverside County area) was 145 percent of the federal 24-hour
standard, and the maximum annual average PM10 (69 &#181;g/m3 recorded
in Metropolitan Riverside County) was 138 percent of the federal
annual PM10 standard. The maximum sulfate concentration (26.3
&#181;g/m3 in Metropolitan Riverside County) was 105 percent of
the state sulfate standard.
<P>
Concentrations of other pollutants remained below the standards.
The maximum annual average nitrogen dioxide concentration (0.0464
ppm in the East San Gabriel Valley and Northwest San Bernardino
Valley areas) was 87 percent of the federal standard, while the
maximum annual average sulfur dioxide concentration (0.0030 ppm
in South Central Los Angeles County) was 10 percent of the federal
standard. The maximum quarterly average lead concentration recorded
at any District air monitoring station was 4 percent of the federal
standard. However, higher concentrations of lead (40 percent of
the standard) were recorded at special monitoring locations immediately
adjacent to stationary sources.
<P>
Figure 2-3 shows the percent of days on which the federal and
state standards were exceeded in 1995 at the Basin locations which
exceeded most frequently. The federal ozone standard was exceeded
on a maximum of 20 percent of days (in the East San Gabriel Valley
area of Los Angeles County), and the federal carbon monoxide standard
was exceeded on a maximum of 4 percent of days (in South Central
Los Angeles County). Exceedances of the federal 24-hour PM10 standard
were recorded on a maximum of 7 percent of days sampled (Metropolitan
Riverside County), while the state sulfate standard was exceeded
on a maximum of 2 percent of days sampled (Metropolitan Riverside
County).

Detailed analyses of current air quality and statistics for all
monitoring areas are contained in Appendix II. The following sections
present summary information on health effects and how frequently,
and by how much of a margin, different areas of the Basin and
MDAB/SSAB exceeded the federal and state ambient air quality standards
in 1995.
<P><b>Ozone (O3) Specific Information</b>
<P>
<b>Health Effects</b>

<P>
Individuals exercising outdoors, children and people with preexisting
lung disease such as asthma and chronic pulmonary lung disease
are considered to be the most susceptible sub-groups for ozone
effects. Short-term exposures (lasting for a few hours) to ozone
at levels typically observed in Southern California can result
in breathing pattern changes, reduction of breathing capacity,
increased susceptibility to infections, inflammation of the lung
tissue, and some immunological changes. In recent years, a correlation
between elevated ambient ozone levels and increases in daily hospital
admission rates, as well as mortality, has also been reported.
<P>
Ozone exposure under exercising conditions is known to increase
the severity of the above mentioned observed responses. Similarly,
animal studies suggest that exposures to a combination of pollutants
which include ozone is more toxic than exposure to ozone alone.
Although lung volume and resistance changes observed after a single
exposure diminish with repeated exposures, biochemical and cellular
changes appear to persist, which can lead to subsequent lung structural
changes. The cancer causing potential of ozone exposure identified
in some studies needs further evaluation to draw any definitive
conclusions.
<P><b>Air Quality</b>

<P>
In 1995, the South Coast Air Quality Management District monitored
ozone concentrations at 33 locations in the Basin and MDAB/SSAB.
In the Basin, the maximum ozone concentration (0.26 ppm recorded
in the central San Bernardino Mountain area) was 200 percent of
the federal standard and 260 percent of the state standard. Los
Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties had maxima above
the stage I episode level (0.20 ppm). Ozone concentrations at
Orange County locations remained below the episode level, but
the maximum exceeded the health advisory level (0.15 ppm). Table
2-2 shows maximum ozone concentrations by Basin and County.
<P>
Maximum ozone concentrations in the MDAB/SSAB areas monitored
by the District were lower than in the Basin. However, the maximum
concentration in the Riverside County SSAB (0.16 ppm in the Coachella
Valley area) still exceeded the health advisory level.

The number of days exceeding the federal standard varied widely
by area (Figure 2-4). Areas along the immediate coast did not
exceed the federal standard, due in large part to the prevailing
sea breeze which transports polluted air inland before high ozone
concentrations can be reached. In addition, some inland areas
which are remote from urban areas of the Basin did not exceed
the standard. The standard was exceeded most frequently in the
inland valleys extending from East San Fernando Valley through
the San Gabriel Valley into the Riverside-San Bernardino area,
and in the adjacent mountains. The East San Gabriel Valley recorded
the greatest number of exceedances of the federal standard (73
days), health advisory level (48 days) and Stage I episode level
(9 days). The greatest number of state standard exceedances (123
days) was recorded in the East San Bernardino Valley area.

<P><b>Carbon Monoxide (CO) Specific Information</b>
<P>
<b>Health Effects</b>

<P>
A consistent association between increasing ambient CO levels
and excess admissions for heart diseases, such as congestive heart
failure, is observed in many cities across the United States.
Individuals with a deficient blood supply to the heart are more
susceptible to the adverse effects of CO exposure. The effects
observed include earlier onset of chest pain with exercise, and
electrocardiograph changes indicative of worsening oxygen supply
to the heart.
<P>
Inhaled CO has no direct toxic effect on the lungs, but exerts
its effect on tissues by interfering with oxygen transport by
competing with oxygen to combine with hemoglobin present in the
blood to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). Hence, conditions with
an increased demand for oxygen supply can be adversely affected
by exposure to CO. Examples include fetal development, chronic
hypoxemia (oxygen deficiency) as seen in high altitudes, anemia,
and diseases involving heart and blood vessels.
<P>
Reduction in birth weight and impaired neurobehavioral development
have been observed in animals chronically exposed to CO resulting
in COHb levels similar to those observed in smokers.

Carbon monoxide concentrations were measured at 22 locations in
the Basin and neighboring MDAB/SSAB areas in 1995. Table 2-3 shows
the 1995 maximum 8-hour average concentrations of carbon monoxide
by air basin and county. The highest concentration recorded in
the Basin (13.86 ppm in South Central Los Angeles County) was
146 percent of the federal standard and 152 percent of the state
standard. Maximum carbon monoxide concentrations in Orange, Riverside,
and San Bernardino County areas of the Basin did not exceed the
standards.
<P>
Maxima for the MDAB/SSAB were much lower. Carbon monoxide levels
in both Los Angeles and Riverside County MDAB/SSAB areas remained
well below the federal standard.
<P>
Figure 2-5 shows the number of days exceeding the federal standard
in 1995. Exceedances were limited to the areas of Los Angeles
County where vehicular traffic is most dense, with the maximum

<b>Particulate Matter (PM10) Specific Information</b>
<p>
<b>Health Effects</b>

<P>
A consistent correlation between elevated ambient PM10 levels
and an increase in mortality rates, respiratory infections, number
and severity of asthma attacks and the number of hospital admissions
has been observed in different parts of the United States and
various areas around the world. Although the concentrations and/or
combinations of pollutants are significantly different in these
studies, most of the PM10 levels recorded in these studies are
lower than those observed in the South Coast Air Basin.
<P>
In recent years, some studies have reported an association between
long-term exposure to air pollution dominated by fine particles
and increased mortality, reduction in life-span, and the possibility
of an increased incidence of cancer.
<P>
Daily fluctuations in PM10 levels have also been related to hospital
admissions for acute respiratory conditions in children, to school
and kindergarten absences, to a decrease in respiratory lung volumes
in normal children and to increased medication use in children
and adults with asthma.
<P>
The elderly, people with pre-existing respiratory and/or cardiovascular
disease and children appear to be susceptible to the effects of
PM10. There is a growing consensus among the scientific community
that the fine fraction of PM10 is relatively more toxic than the
coarse fraction and is responsible for the majority of effects
observed.
<p><b>Air Quality</b>

<P>
PM10 concentrations were monitored at 21 locations by the South
Coast Air Quality Management District in 1995. Maximum 24-hour
and annual average concentrations are shown in Tables 2-4 and
2-5. The maximum 24-hour PM10 concentration recorded in the Basin
(219 &#181;g/m3 in the Metropolitan Riverside County area) was
145 percent of the federal standard and 429 percent of the state
standard. The maximum was associated with high winds, but other
exceedances of the federal standard not associated with high winds
were recorded. Maximum concentrations in all four of the Basin
counties exceeded the federal 24-hour standard. The maximum annual
average PM10 (69 &#181;g/m3 in Metropolitan Riverside County)
was 138 percent of the federal annual standard. The federal annual
standard was exceeded in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties
but not in Los Angeles or Orange Counties. The much more stringent
state annual standard was exceeded in all areas of the Basin.
<P>
In 1995, both annual and 24-hour maximum concentrations of PM10
in the Los Angeles County portion of the MDAB were below the federal
standards. However in the Riverside County area of the SSAB, both
standards were exceeded. The maximum 24-hour PM10 concentration
(199 &#181;g/m3 in the Coachella Valley) was 132 percent of the
federal 24-hour standard, and was associated with high winds in
the desert areas. The maximum annual average PM10 concentration
(52.0 &#181;g/m3 in the Coachella Valley) was 104 percent of the
federal annual standard. It should be noted that the exclusion
of the high wind event day reduces the annual average to 49.5
&#181;g/m3, or 99 percent of the standard.

Figure 2-6 shows the percent of days exceeding the federal 24-hour
average PM10 standard in 1995. (PM10 is normally sampled every
sixth day, and for this reason is reported in terms of the percent
of days sampled which exceeded the standard.) The federal standard
was exceeded in parts of all four Basin counties, with the greatest
percent of days exceeding recorded in the vicinity of the Metropolitan
Riverside County area. No exceedances were recorded in the coastal
Los Angeles and Orange County areas, or in the inland areas of
the Basin most removed from urban areas. However, still further
inland (east of the area on the map) the SSAB's Coachella Valley
area did record an exceedance of the standard, which was associated
with high winds. The more stringent state 24-hour PM10 standard
was exceeded at all District monitoring locations in the Basin

<p><b>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Specific Information</b>
<p>
<b>Health Effects</b>

<P>
Population-based studies suggest that an increase in acute respiratory
illness, including infections and respiratory symptoms in children
(not infants), is associated with long-term exposures to NO2 at
levels found in homes with gas stoves, which are higher than ambient
levels found in Southern California. Increase in resistance to
air flow and airway contraction without any effect on lung volumes
(breathing capacity) is observed after short-term exposure to
NO2 in healthy subjects. Larger decreases in lung volumes are
observed in individuals with asthma and/or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) than in
healthy individuals, following exposure to lower levels of NO2,
indicating the greater susceptibility of these sub-groups.
<P>
In animals, exposure to levels of NO2 considerably higher than
ambient concentrations results in increased susceptibility to
infections, possibly due to the observed changes in cells involved
in maintaining immune functions. The severity of lung tissue damage
associated with high levels of ozone exposure increases when animals
are exposed to a combination of ozone and NO2.

In 1995, nitrogen dioxide concentrations were monitored at 24
locations. No area of the Basin, MDAB or SSAB exceeded the federal
or state standards for nitrogen dioxide. Maximum annual average
concentrations for 1995 are shown in Table 2-6. The highest annual
average concentrations recorded in the Basin (0.0464 ppm in the
East San Gabriel Valley and Northwest San Bernardino Valley areas)
were 87 percent of the federal standard, while the highest concentration
recorded in the MDAB/SSAB was 42 percent of the standard. The
Basin has not exceeded the federal standard for nitrogen dioxide
since 1991, when the Los Angeles County portion of the Basin recorded
the last exceedance of the standard in any U.S. county.
<P>
The state standard was not exceeded at any District monitoring
location in 1995. The highest 1-hour average concentration recorded
(0.24 ppm in Central Los Angeles) was 92 percent of the state
standard.

<b>Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Specific Information</b>
<P>
<b>Health Effects</b>

<P>
Even an exposure of a few minutes to low levels of SO2 can result
in airway constriction in some asthmatics. All asthmatics are
sensitive to the effects of SO2. In asthmatics, increase in resistance
to air flow, as well as reduction in breathing capacity leading
to severe breathing difficulties, are observed after acute exposure
to SO2. In contrast, healthy individuals do not exhibit similar
acute responses even after exposure to higher concentrations of
SO2.
<P>
Animal studies suggest that despite SO2 being a respiratory irritant,
it does not cause substantial acute or chronic toxicity at ambient
concentrations. However, very high levels of exposure can cause
lung edema (fluid accumulation), lung tissue damage, and sloughing
off of cells lining the respiratory tract.
<P>
Some population-based studies indicate that the mortality and
morbidity effects associated with fine particles show a similar
association with ambient SO2 levels. In these studies, efforts
to separate the effects of SO2 from fine particles have not been
successful. It is not clear whether the two pollutants act synergistically
or whether one pollutant alone is the predominant factor.
<P><b>Air Quality</b>

<P>
No exceedances of federal or state standards for sulfur dioxide
occurred in 1995 at any of the nine District locations monitored.
Though sulfur dioxide concentrations remain well below the standards,
sulfur dioxide is a precursor to sulfate, which is a component
of PM10. Standards for both sulfate and PM10 were exceeded in
1995.
<P>
Maximum concentrations of sulfur dioxide for 1995 are shown in
Table 2-7. The maximum 24-hour average sulfur dioxide (0.018 ppm,
recorded in South Coastal Los Angeles County) was 13 percent of
the federal 24-hour standard. The maximum annual average concentration
(0.0030 ppm in the South Central Los Angeles County area) was
10 percent of the federal annual standard.
<P>
Sulfur dioxide was not measured at MDAB/SSAB sites in 1995. Historical
measurements showed concentrations to be well below standards
and monitoring has been discontinued.
<P>
The more stringent state 1-hour standard was last exceeded in
1990, due to a breakdown at a Basin refinery (the first such exceedance
since 1984). In 1995, the maximum 1-hour average sulfur dioxide
concentration (0.14 ppm in the South Coastal Los Angeles County
area) recorded was 54 percent of the state standard.

<b>Sulfates (SO4=) Specific Information</b>
<p>
<b>Health Effects</b>

<P>
Most of the health effects associated with fine particles and
sulfur dioxide at ambient levels are also attributable to sulfates.
Thus, both mortality and morbidity effects are observable with
an increase in ambient sulfate concentrations. However, efforts
to separate the effects of sulfates from the effects of other
pollutants, including ozone, have not been successful.
<P>
Clinical studies of asthmatics exposed to sulfuric acid suggest
that adolescent asthmatics are probably a subgroup susceptible
to acid aerosol exposure. Animal studies suggest that acidic particles
such as sulfuric acid aerosol and ammonium bisulfate are probably
more toxic than non-acidic particles like ammonium sulfate. Whether
the effects are attributable to acidity or to particles remains
unresolved. However, the severity of effects observed appears
to be greater in population studies from the eastern United States
and Canada, where sulfate concentrations are higher, than in the
western United States.
<p><b>Air Quality</b>

<P>
In 1995, the state sulfate standard was exceeded in one area of
the Basin (the Metropolitan Riverside County area) on 2 percent
of days sampled. The maximum concentration recorded (26.3 &#181;g/m3)
was 105 percent of the state standard. Maximum concentrations
by air basin and county are shown in Table 2-8. No exceedances
were recorded in Los Angeles, Orange, or San Bernardino Counties
in 1995.
<P>
No sulfate data were obtained at MDAB/SSAB stations in 1995. Historical
sulfate data showed concentrations in the MDAB/SSAB areas to be

<b>Lead (Pb) Specific Information</b>
<p>
<b>Health Effects</b>

<P>
Fetuses, infants, and children are more sensitive than others
to the adverse effects of lead exposure. Exposure to low levels
of lead can adversely affect the development and function of the
central nervous system, leading to learning disorders, distractibility,
inability to follow simple commands, and lower intelligence quotient.
In adults, increased lead levels are associated with increased
blood pressure.
<P>
Lead poisoning can cause anemia, lethargy, seizures and death.
It appears that there are no direct effects of lead on the respiratory
system. Lead can be stored in the bone from early-age environmental
exposure, and elevated blood lead levels can occur due to breakdown
of bone tissue during pregnancy, hyperthyroidism (increased secretion
of hormones from the thyroid gland) and osteoporosis (breakdown
of bony tissue). Fetuses and breast-fed babies can be exposed
to higher levels of lead because of previous environmental lead
exposure of their mothers.<p>
<b>Air Quality</b>

<P>
The federal and state standards for lead were not exceeded in
any area of the District in 1995. There have been no violations
of the standards at the District's regular air monitoring stations
since 1982 as a result of removal of lead from gasolines. However,
special monitoring stations immediately adjacent to stationary
sources of lead have recorded exceedances of the standards in
very localized areas of the Basin as recently as 1991 for the
federal standard and 1994 for the state standard. Table 2-9 shows
the maximum concentrations recorded in 1995.
<P>
The maximum quarterly average lead concentration (0.06 &#181;g/m3
at several Los Angeles County sites) recorded at District air
monitoring stations was 4 percent of the federal standard. The
highest quarterly average lead concentration (0.60 &#181;g/m3
in Southeast Los Angeles County) measured at special monitoring
locations immediately adjacent to stationary sources of lead was
40 percent of the federal standard.
<P>
The maximum monthly average lead concentration at the regular
monitoring stations (.07 &#181;g/m3 at several Los Angeles County
locations) was 5 percent of the state standard, and the maximum
at the special monitoring sites immediately adjacent to sources
(0.62 &#181;g/m3 in Southeast Los Angeles County) was 41 percent
of the standard.

<b>Visibility Specific Information</b>

<P>
Air pollution induced visibility degradation in the Basin is due
primarily to particulate matter. On some days, the presence of
water droplets may contribute significantly to visibility reduction.
Days for which this is true are removed by excluding days on which
the relative humidity was greater than 70 percent from consideration
when determining compliance with the standard
<P>
In 1995, visual range data were collected at two locations in
the Basin. Both sites exceeded the state standard by a significant
margin. The standard was exceeded on a maximum of 35 percent of
days in the only area (East San Gabriel Valley area of Los Angeles
County) for which complete data were available.
<P><b>Summary</b>

<P>
In 1995, the Basin continued to exceed federal and state standards
for ozone, PM10, and carbon monoxide, and the state standards
for sulfate and visibility. The MDAB/SSAB areas continued to exceed
standards for ozone and PM10. However for PM10, the removal of
one high wind natural event in the Coachella Valley results in
MDAB/SSAB meeting the federal PM10 standards, but not the state
PM10 standards.
<P>
The Basin exceeded one or more federal standards on nearly one
third of the days of the year. Maximum concentrations of PM10
and carbon monoxide were nearly one and one-half times the federal
standards, and the maximum ozone concentration was twice the federal
standard.

<P>

Achieving clean air objectives requires the effective and timely
implementation of the measures defined in Chapter 4. In general,
these measures rely on the application and advancement of technologies
and management practices. These strategies also require actions
by numerous agencies.
<H3><A NAME="72"></A>RESPONSIBLE
AGENCIES</H3>

<P>
Implementation of the Plan's strategies requires a cooperative
partnership of governmental agencies at the federal, state, regional
and local level. As described in Table 7-1, these agencies form
the four cornerstones from which implementation programs will
evolve.
<P>
At the federal level is the U.S. EPA and other agencies charged
with reducing emissions from federally controlled sources such
as commercial aircraft and marine vessels. As discussed in Chapter
4, the 1997 AQMP incorporates several measures based largely on
the 1994 California Ozone SIP. Seven of the mobile source measures
are directed at federally regulated sources.
<P>
At the state level is the ARB which is responsible for motor vehicle
emissions and fuels. The Plan's on-road and off-road mobile source
control program is principally based on the 1994 California Ozone
SIP. Additional mobile source emission reduction credit programs
are provided in this Plan to provide greater regulatory flexibility
and accelerate fleet turnover.
<P>
At the regional level, the District is responsible for the overall
development and implementation of the AQMP. The District is specifically
authorized to reduce the emissions from stationary and some area
sources such as coatings and solvents. The District implements
its responsibilities with participation from the regulated community
through an extensive rule development and implementation program.
This approach maximizes the input of those parties affected by
the proposed rule through consultation meetings, public workshops,
and ongoing working groups.
<P>
At the local level are local governments and the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) and other committees of government.
Local governments serve an important role in developing and implementing
the Plan's transportation control measures. SCAG is responsible
for providing the socioeconomic forecast (e.g., population forecasts)
upon which the Plan is based. SCAG also provides assessments for
conformity of regionally significant projects with the overall
Plan and is responsible for the adoption of the annual Regional
Transportation Improvement Program.

<H3><A NAME="73"></A>SHORT - AND INTERMEDIATE-TERM MEASURES</H3>

<P>
The Plan proposes measures that can be implemented using currently
available technologies and management practices. Measures in this
category are to be implemented by all levels of government including
federal agencies, the state ARB, the District and local governments
and SCAG.

Control
Measure Ranking</B>

<P>
The California Clean Air Act requires air pollution control districts
to assess the effectiveness of control measures in reducing ambient
ozone concentrations as part of their plan submittals. The CCAA
requires districts to determine that their AQMPs are cost-effective
strategies that attain air quality standards by the earliest practicable
date [H&amp;SC 40913(b)]. In addition, plans must include an assessment
of the cost-effectiveness of available and proposed control measures
and a list of the measures ranked from the least cost-effective
to the most cost-effective [H&amp;SC 40922(a)]. Table 6-5 in Chapter
6 shows the ranking of the control measures by cost-effectiveness.
In developing their control strategy implementation schedule,
districts must consider the other effectiveness criteria [H&amp;SC
40922(b)]. The criteria used for this Plan are listed in Table
7-2.

<PRE WIDTH=132>
        Criteria                              Description                       

Cost-Effectiveness       The cost of a control measure to reduce air pollution  
                         by one ton [cost covers obtaining, installing, and     
                         operating the control measure].                        

Efficiency               The positive effects of a control measure compared to  
                         its negative effects.                                  

Emission Reduction       The total amount of<B> </B>pollution that a control measure   
Potential                can actually reduce.                                   

Enforceability           The ability to force polluters to comply with a        
                         control measure.                                       

Equity                   The fairness of the distribution of all the positive   
                         and negative effects among various socioeconomic       
                         groups                                                 

Legal Authority          Ability of the District or other adopting agency to    
                         implement the measure or the likelihood that local     
                         governments and agencies will cooperate to approve a   
                         control measures                                       

Public Acceptability     The support the public gives to a control measure.     

Rate of Emission         The time it will take for a control measure to reduce  
Reduction                a certain amount of air pollution.                     

Technological            The likelihood that the technology for a control       
                         measure will be available as anticipated.

<P>
Table 7-3 lists the short- and intermediate-term control measures,
the responsible agencies, and the proposed adoption and implementation
dates. This preliminary schedule is largely based on the schedule
set forth in the 1994 AQMP as modified through subsequent District
Board action. New items proposed for the first time in this Plan
have been placed in the appropriate position on the existing schedule
based on a review of the AQMP control measure prioritization factors
described above.
<P>
Other measures from the 1994 AQMP that are not included in Table
7-3 have been moved to the Level II Contingency (or Further Evaluation)
Category. These measures will undergo further evaluation after
the 1997 AQMP is adopted to determine if these measures can serve
as contingency or provide additional emission reductions to achieve
state air pollution standards or potential future federal air
quality standards.

<HR>
<P>
<B>Federal
Agencies</B>

<P>
The Plan proposes to incorporate several measures defined in the
1994 California Ozone SIP that are directed at federally regulated
sources. Specifically, the Plan contains seven measures relative
to sources such as planes, ships, trains, most construction and
farm equipment, industrial equipment, and off-highway vehicles.
These SIP-related measures are listed on Table 7-3.
<P>
<B>
ARB
</B>

<P>
Several measures are proposed to be implemented by the ARB. One
of the most important of these measures is the implementation
of the scrappage program (i.e., M1).
<P>
The ARB is also responsible for adopting some of the off-road
mobile source emission standards, and will be implementing the
control measures in the AQMP directed towards reducing emissions
from consumer products. Table 7-3 identifies the control measures
that ARB (and other state agencies) will be responsible for implementing
in the 1997 AQMP.
<P>
There are several other state agencies that will need to implement
control measures which fall within their authority. For example,
the state Department of Pesticides Regulation (DPR) has direct
authority over pesticide applications. ARB will have a key role
in working with the DPR, along with the District, to ensure that
the measure is implemented.
<B>District
</B>

<P>
The District is responsible for implementing the stationary source
control measures and some of the area and mobile source measures.
As shown in Table 7-3, stationary source control measures will
be implemented primarily through District rules and regulations
as specified in federal and state law.
<P><B>
Stationary
and Area Source Measures</B>

<P>
As indicated in Chapter 4, several key new approaches are proposed
for implementing the stationary source emission reduction measures.
Specifically, the Plan proposes to use source-specific control
approaches, market incentives, educational outreach efforts, permitting
processes, and manufacturer certification processes to implement
most of the stationary source measures. In addition, the Intercredit
Trading Program and the Air Quality Investment Program will provide
greater flexibility to stationary sources to comply with District
regulations. Chapter 4 and Appendix IV provide more detail relative
to these implementation approaches.
<P>
<B>Transportation
Control Measures</B>
<P><B>
Market
Incentive Measures
</B>
<P>
A market incentives task force was established with SCAG, CalTrans,
the Coalition for Local Environmental Solutions and a Competitive
Economy (COALESCE), the District and over 50 business and industry
leaders to develop a regional congestion and air quality mitigation
program to replace the Indirect Source Rules contained in the
1994 AQMP and to improve mobility in the region. The Reduce Emissions
And Congestion on Highways (REACH) Task Force was convened in
response to actions called for in the 1994 AQMP and SCAG's Market
Incentives Task Force. Under a $1.1 million grant from the Federal
Highway Administration and a $220,000<B> </B>contribution from
COALESCE, the REACH Task Force is exploring the feasibility of
establishing nominal charges for motorists based upon vehicle
use to improve mobility and air quality. Money raised through
these fees would likely be dedicated to improving air quality,
and the transportation system.
<P><B>
Local
Governments and SCAG</B>

<P>
Local governments (cities and counties) are also responsible for
helping to provide supportive actions through participation in
voluntary programs. Local governments and transportation agencies
are also responsible for implementing several measures in the
Plan including, but not limited to, the transportation improvements
called for in the Plan. SCAG is responsible for helping local
governments coordinate their efforts and for ensuring that the
region's transportation projects, programs and plans conform to
the SIP.
<P>
<B>Congestion
Management Program (CMP) Linkage to the AQMP</B>

<P>
The CMP is a comprehensive strategy to relieve traffic congestion
and maintain levels of service on roadways. Assembly Bill (AB)
471 and AB 1791 required county transportation commissions (CTCs)
or other designated agencies to adopt a CMP by December 1, 1991.
County CMPs have subsequently been developed in consultation with
the regional transportation planning agency (i.e., SCAG), regional
transportation providers, local governments, Caltrans, and the
District.
<P>
The CMP interlinks with the AQMP in several areas. Most AQMP transportation
control measures included in the Regional Transportation Improvement
Program are designed to help relieve congestion. Implementation
of the AQMP will help local governments tackle congestion, reduce
emissions from idling vehicles or vehicles traveling on congested
roadways, and help maintain the CMP's level of service standards.
<P>
Many local governments already have ordinances under development
or approved to comply with the CMP. Through the CMP, local governments
have contributed to the clean air effort. Local governments may
receive credits for emission reductions associated with the implementation
of CMPs to the extent they are real, quantifiable, and enforceable
and have not been included in the AQMP baseline as part of the
Regional Mobility Element (RME).
<P>
The CMP and the AQMP are further linked through the local capital
improvement program. This required element of the CMP must be
consistent with the county and Regional Transportation Improvement
Program (RTIP), which in turn must be consistent with the RME.
The latter in turn must conform with the AQMP.
<P>
In addition, local governments are encouraged to work cooperatively
with their CTCs and subregional agencies to craft integrated trip
reduction strategies to meet the CMP trip reduction requirements.
<P>
<B>
Southern
California Economic Partnership (The Partnership)</B>

<P>
The Partnership is a non-profit organization with a 26-member
Board of Directors assigned the mission of accelerating the deployment
of advanced transportation technologies (ATTs) throughout Southern
California. It was established out of the needs of the SCAG Regional
Mobility Element and the 1994 AQMP to have an effective implementation
organization for advanced transportation technology strategies.
<P>
The Partnership, through its public/private participatory structure,
is uniquely capable of providing networking and guidance to those
parties interested in the deployment of advanced transportation
technologies throughout Southern California. Stakeholder &quot;cluster
group&quot; meetings on each technology are held on a regular
basis, usually at the District or at SCAG offices, to discuss
implementation barriers and assist in the development of deployment
and marketing strategies. It has in effect become a clearinghouse
of ATT information and progress.
<P>
To aid Southern California cities and counties in ATT deployment,
The Partnership has developed &quot;Model City Starter Kits&quot;
for each of the technologies. These books provide goals and objectives,
implementation worksheets, model policies, model resolutions,
building codes, product/service technology updates, infrastructure
suggestions and requirements, training and safety requirements,
case studies, funding opportunities and an activity recognition
program. The Partnership provides these comprehensive guide books
free to each Southern California community and conducts workshops
and presentations to encourage participants to use ATTs. It also
develops and distributes ATT newsletters and promotional materials
to heighten awareness and garner unified understanding and support
for the technologies from both the public and private sectors.
Most of this information is also presented on The Partnership's
Web Site which is continuously updated with deployment achievements
throughout the region. Measures to be carried out by The Partnership
are non-regulatory &amp; thus do not have specific &quot;adoption&quot;
dates but will be implemented through the AQMP planning period.
Legislation may assist in implementing these measures but it is
too early to establish specific adoption dates.
<P>
<B>The Partnership Market Deployment Plan</B>

<P>
The Partnership applies the same market deployment strategic planning
to each of the five AQMP advanced technologies. The approach is
multi-disciplinary, totally integrated, constantly evolving and
consists of: 1) deployment education and guidance, 2) workshops
and outreach, 3) technology/industry communications and awareness
programs, 4) information distribution and networking support,
5) partnership creation/brokering, and 6) legislative initiatives
and actions.
<P>
<B>Deployment Education and Guidance</B>

<P>
&quot;Model City Starter Kits, &quot; presented in easy-to-update
three-ring binders, have been created for each of the technologies
and distributed free of charge to every city and county in the
South Coast Air Basin and the SCAG region.
<P>
<B>Workshops and Outreach</B>

<P>
To generate additional interest and understanding of technology
deployment, The Partnership occasionally hosts technology workshops
at the District and other convenient locations for local elected
officials, city planners and managers, with considerable private
sector involvement and support. In addition to these workshops,
The Partnership also: 1) makes presentations to cities, schools
and organizations; 2) distributes monthly technology &quot;News
Flashes&quot; to all stakeholders via facsimile; and 3) attends
the meetings of related organizations and project developers.
<P>
<B>
Technology/Industry Communications and Awareness Programs
</B>

<P>
The Partnership has created individual technology/industry logos
and slogans to help give a singular identity, purpose and synergy
to advanced transportation deployment activities throughout the
region. It is intended that these logos and slogans, and the customizable
advertising and promotional materials on which they appear, can
be accepted and used by both public and private sector technology
participants to foster cooperation and accelerate awareness, understanding
and support among the public at large. To the extent possible,
the creation of these materials is financed by the private sector.
<P><B>Information Distribution and Industry Networking Support</B>

<P>
In its unique technology-neutral position, The Partnership has
created a breakthrough, advertising-supported, consumer friendly
Web Site which individually showcases each technology. The interactive
site encourages feedback from stakeholders and, as a clearinghouse
of information, provides networking opportunities between manufacturers/service
providers and purchasers/implementors. It is organized into fifteen
sub-home pages for quick access and maneuverability:
<UL>
<LI>Partnership
<LI>Mission and Schedule of Meetings and Activities
<LI>(5) Technology Showcases
<LI>Helpful Technology Application Scenarios
<LI>Technology Showroom
<LI>Hyperlinks to Manufacturers
<LI>Infrastructure Requirements
<LI>Hyperlinks to Product/Service Providers
<LI>Infrastructure Deployment
<LI>Up-to-Date Locations of Infrastructure Deployment
<LI>Industry Information Bank
<LI>Hyperlinks to Associations, Organizations, Resources
<LI>Model City Starter Kit Order Form
<LI>Feedback Forum
<LI>Partnership Creation/Brokering
</UL>

<P>
Since The Partnership works closely with all the stakeholders
in each of the five advanced transportation technologies, it has
become a de facto clearinghouse of ATT information. In this capacity,
it is uniquely suited to direct and introduce interested participants
to other stakeholders with similar goals and into the formation
of productive and mutually beneficial public/private partnerships.
<P>
Much of The Partnership's efforts will be documented on the Internet
at the following address: &quot;www.scag.ca.gov/depts/scep/.&quot;

<H3><A NAME = "74">LONG-TERM
MEASURES</A></H3>

<P>
Implementation of the long-term measures in the 1997 AQMP depends
on advances and breakthroughs that are expected over the next
13 years. This requires aggressive research and development efforts
which have been ongoing at the District and other state and federal
agencies.
<P>
As outlined in Chapter 4, achieving clean air standards in the
South Coast area requires the application of advanced technologies.
The District's Technology Advancement Office (TAO) sponsors public-private
research and development partnerships in order to identify and
promote low- and zero-emissions technologies for both stationary
and mobile sources. The Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction
Review Committee (MSRC) which was established in 1990 with the
adoption of Assembly Bill 2766, funds projects to reduce air pollution
from motor vehicles as needed for implementing the California
Clean Air Act of 1988.
<P>
Table 7-4 lists some key recently-completed or currently-underway
projects sponsored by the TAO to facilitate development and commercialization
of low-polluting technologies. Table 7-5 lists recently completed
or current projects sponsored by the MSRC to reduce mobile source
emissions. Tables 7-4 and 7-5 are the specific long-term measures
associated with the projects. Some of the stationary source projects
do not have specific linkages to the long-term measures but serve
as future technologies that may be available to meet current regulations
with future compliance dates or short- and intermediate-term AQMP
control measures.
<P>
The AQMP proposes an incentive program to encourage the use of
fuel cell technology. The 1994 AQMP also created a fuel cell implementation
task force whose role is to<I>:</I> (1) identify specific areas
and goals for fuel cell<STRIKE>s</STRIKE> application, <I> </I>(2)
investigate infrastructure needs for the development of fuel cells,
and (3) suggest mechanisms to accomplish the goal of expediting
the commercial implementation of fuel cells in the Basin. The
task force is led by the District and comprised of representatives
of potential interested and affected parties in the Basin and
fuel cell manufacturers. The overall goal of the task force is
to provide incentives for people to utilize and perhaps manufacture
fuel cells in the Basin.
<P>
Table 7-6 lists the targeted implementation schedule for the proposed
long term measures. To ultimately achieve full implementation
of the advanced technologies, control methods and market mechanisms
proposed in this Plan, numerous agencies will need to develop
and follow implementation schedules. These agencies, as well as
the District, may need to seek additional legal authority and
resources, including funding, to carry out some of the activities
for which they are responsible.

AQMP
Commercialization Plan for Advanced Technologies and Fuels</B>

<P>
The commercialization of advanced zero and near-zero emission
technologies is essential in order to fully implement the AQMP.
Section 182(e)(5) of the federal Clean Air Act contemplates that
expedited actions will be undertaken to ensure that the cleanest
technologies and fuels are brought to their fullest possible market
potential to address the particularly severe air quality in Southern
California. An AQMP Commercialization Plan for Advanced Technologies
and Fuels has been developed which focuses on the key steps which
must be undertaken to establish sustainable and growing markets
for the utilization of advanced technologies and clean fuels.
<P>
The District's Technology Advancement Office has, over the last
eight years, established a strong and widely respected foundation
for the continued development, demonstration, technology transfer
and commercialization of innovative zero and near-zero emission
technologies. Such technologies include fuel cells; alternative
fuel vehicles such as electric vehicles and those fueled by CNG,
methanol, LNG, etc.; advanced coatings; and fugitive emission
mitigation technologies. In order to build on the success of these
efforts, a Commercialization Plan has been developed which identifies
the key steps to be undertaken in the context of the 1997 AQMP
to help foster the widespread market penetration of these technologies
and alternative clean fuels. Table 7-7 identifies the key elements
of this Plan. A major focus of this Commercialization Plan is
on the specific projects that can be funded and/or coordinated
through a targeted Commercialization Program within the District's
Technology Advancement Office.
<P>
This Commercialization Plan emphasizes a synergistic approach
which combines the following program elements:
<UL>
<LI>Biennial technology assessments are needed which routinely
update the identification of cutting edge technology. Such assessments
will identify the lowest emission technologies currently being
researched, developed, demonstrated and commercialized. Due to
the fast pace and international scope of innovation, these assessments
will provide continual updates on the leading technologies and
sponsoring organizations. Specific information in these assessments
will include the emission control efficiencies being achieved
by specific technologies in laboratory-scale and commercial scale
applications, as well as the known or projected costs, durability,
operational performance, energy efficiency, environmental sustainability,
principal technical and cost barriers and likely commercial viability
and timeframe for such advanced technology.

Regular Industry and User Workshops are needed which will help
build consensus on the appropriate priorities for joint research,
development, demonstrations and commercialization strategies.
Developers, manufacturers, energy providers, other regulatory
agencies and commercial users of advanced low-emission technologies
have all proven to be essential partners with the District in
implementing cost-effective advanced technology demonstrations,
as well as helping define the critical barriers which need to
be removed to establish a sustainable commercial market for clean
technologies. It is especially constructive to obtain routine
feedback from the users of prototype technologies to identify
and address barriers for more widespread market penetration of
a technology. These workshops will specifically be focused on
identifying the following:
<OL>
<LI>Advanced emission control concepts and technologies
<LI>Research and development needs
<LI>Potential demonstration sites
<LI>Existing and potential involvement in specific advanced technologies
and clean fuels by original equipment manufacturers (OEM's)
<LI>Cost reduction opportunities to enhance the competitiveness
of specific technologies
<LI>Identification of a critical mass of private sector and government
partners to target the sustained development of a technology
<LI>Dissemination of technical and cost information on the leading
zero-emission and near-zero technologies and alternative fuels
</OL>

<UL>
<LI>Formal, competitive solicitations of proposals will be undertaken
for relevant and pragmatic research, development and commercial-scale
demonstrations The evaluation criteria for these solicitations
will involve the following:
</UL>

<OL>
<LI>Emission reduction potential
<LI>Technological innovation
<LI>Project cost-sharing
<LI>Commercialization potential and business development expertise
<LI>Cost-effectiveness
<LI>Relevant contractor experience
<LI>Overall environmental impacts and benefits
</OL>

<LI>The establishment of Commercialization Coordination Council
help bring together industry decision leaders, as well as key
policy makers, to continuously chart the path to commercialization
for core technologies, such as fuel cells, ZEV's and advanced
coatings.
</UL>

<P>
Highly visible market leadership, as well as timely coordination,
among a diverse range of organizations, both public and private,
is critical for the successful introduction of advanced technologies
and clean fuels. The establishment of a prominent and expert Council
to advise the District on key steps which are needed to ensure
the sustainable commercialization of core AQMP technologies will
directly address this need. The specific focus of such Councils
will vary depending on the timeframe in which commercialization
of a specific technology or clean fuel is anticipated. In the
stationary source area, separate Commercialization Coordination
Councils will be established for Consumer Products, Advanced Coatings
and Solvents, Advanced Fugitive Emissions Controls, and Industrial
VOC Controls. For mobile sources, similar Councils will be established
for Advanced On-Road Vehicle Clean Fuels and Technologies (separate
fuel-related or technology related Councils, such as one for Fuel
Cells, may also be established) and for Advanced Off-Road Industrial
Equipment. On-going coordination will also continue with the California
Energy Commission's process of overseeing the restructuring of
the utility industry pursuant to AB 1890.
<P>
Targeted research, development and demonstration projects are
also needed to remove key barriers and prove the commercial robustness
of advanced technologies and alternative clean fuels. These projects
will be funded through the District's Technology Advancement Office,
and will leverage funding provided by other public and private
organizations. These projects will be updated on a routine basis.
The latest Technology Advancement Plan, adopted by the Board at
its October 1996 meeting, served as the foundation for this Commercialization
Plan.
<UL>
<LI>The development of incentives, such as legislative tax incentives
and policies, is needed to help create more competitive and diversified
market conditions for advanced emission control technologies and
clean fuels. Such incentives may include tax incentives for trucking
firms and others to purchase alternative fuel vehicles and infrastructure,
as well as the removal of disincentives in the federal excise
tax code as it applies to vehicle fuel.
</UL>

<P>
Given the diversity of measures identified in the 1997 AQMP, this
Commercialization Plan focuses on specific market niches, some
of which can serve as &quot;market anchors&quot; for wider scale
commercialization and technology transfer over time. Specific
stationary source related commercialization projects are identified
for Consumer Products, Solvents and Coating Operations, Fugitive
Emissions, Miscellaneous Small Sources and industrial process
sources of VOC. Commercialization projects for mobile sources
are also identified, focused on on-road vehicles and off-road
industrial sources.
<P>
Since the District's Technology Advancement Office program primarily
focuses on mobile source related clean fuel projects, the Commercialization
Plan identifies a more extensive list of research, development
and demonstration projects related to the use of advanced emission
control technologies and alternative clean fuels used in passenger
cars, light and medium duty trucks and buses.
<P>
The implementation of this Commercialization Plan will entail
staff and funding resource commitments by the District. Comprehensive
and coordinated efforts will be undertaken which identify all
the critical barriers to commercializing a specific technology.
The Plan also takes a pragmatic approach by focusing simultaneously
on the most viable near term niches for a technology or clean
fuel application, while at the same time addressing specific issues
and potential barriers related to the following:
<UL>
<LI>Technology readiness for wide scale use
<LI>Optimized emission benefits
<LI>Minimized capital and operating costs
<LI>Competitive commercial performance, durability, warranties
and customer support
<LI>Convenient and cost-competitive fueling and recharging infrastructure
<LI>Nurturing of early adapters and market champions
<LI>Establishment of appropriate fuel tax policies and other incentives
<LI>Removal of anti-competitive fuel tax policies and other disincentives
<LI>Maximized learning from in-use demonstration, especially from
commercial users
<LI>Dissemination of technical information
<LI>Participation in industry and/or government workshops, conferences
and working groups, etc.
<LI>Assessment of external regulatory policies (e.g., ARB., PUC,
CEC, EPA, etc.) and the formulation of strategic recommendations
to foster commercialization of advanced technologies and clean
fuels.
</UL>

<P>
Based on the accumulation of successful demonstration experience
with advanced technologies through the District's Technology Advancement
Office, the stage is now set for a targeted Commercialization
Plan which helps further focus District resources. This Plan is
structured to take maximum advantage of the numerous synergies
which exist with other agencies and private industry. The partnerships
needed to implement this Commercialization Plan will be continuously
recast to leverage the most recent trends in market conditions
(e.g., the de-regulated utility sector) and the most advanced
technologies. The success of this Commercialization Plan is also
expected to provide significant economic stimulus to the region's
economy, while helping ensure that air quality standards are achieved
and maintained. When fully realized in the early part of the twenty-first
century, this Plan will represent a model for regional problem
solving and cooperation.
<H3><A NAME = "75">IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT ACTIVITIES</A></H3>

<P>
Implementation of the 1997 AQMP will require support activities
sponsored by the District and SCAG. These efforts are described
in the following subsections.
<P>
<B>District
Assistance and Outreach Programs</B>

<P>
Since the adoption of the 1991 AQMP the District has provided
assistance to the agencies charged with implementing the Plan.
A key accomplishment was the District's CEQA Air Quality Handbook
to assist local governments in assessing and mitigating air quality
impacts from projects within their jurisdiction.
<P>
An important ongoing outreach program is the Interagency AQMP
Implementation Committee (IAIC). The IAIC provides ongoing coordination
between key local government entities and the District Board as
the AQMP is implemented. Some objectives of the IAIC include:
<UL>
<LI>Identifying how local governments throughout the region should
interact with the District to ensure implementation of the AQMP.
<LI>Identifying and resolving issues that could affect timely
implementation of the AQMP.
<LI>Assisting the District in developing and carrying out its
local government outreach program to ensure that local government
information, technical, and policy input needs are met.
<LI>Determining how local governments should be involved in the
AQMP implementation update process.
<LI>Developing a structure for identifying, analyzing, and resolving
potential conflicts between air quality and other regional goals.
</UL>

<P>
The IAIC also established a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC)
which provides technical input on AQMP programs and policies,
and suggested issues relating to AQMP implementation for the IAIC
to discuss.
<P>
Through the IAIC and TAC, the District is better able to facilitate
and coordinate the implementation efforts of the local agencies
in the Basin.
<B>Business
Assistance</B>

<P>
The District has initiated several programs to assist businesses
that must comply with the requirements promulgated in the Plan.
For the 1997 AQMP, these efforts will be continued and strengthened.
Several of the District's assistance programs are highlighted
below.
<P>
Through the District's &quot;New Directions&quot; campaign, several
programs have been developed and implemented to assist the regulated
community. These programs include: permit streamlining practices,
interaction with small and medium-sized businesses, source education
programs, compliance assessment programs and the continued implementation
of the Small Business Assistance and Economic Development and
Business Retention offices.
<P>
The Public Advisor assures business input to the District's policy
makers through community workshops, industry-specific meeting,
and ethnic business working groups. Fee Review and other technical
assistance helps companies resolve issues in a cooperative manner.
<P>
The District's Small Business Assistance office helps owners/operators
participate in the District's policy and rule development process
and helps them comply with applicable requirements. It offers
permit application and processing assistance as well as compliance
and financial assistance.
<P>
The Air Quality Assistance Fund (AQAF) is one of the Small Business
Assistance office's many functions. The District established this
program to assist small businesses within its jurisdiction needing
financial help to purchase air pollution control equipment. The
loan guarantee may be approved for up to 90 percent of the loan
amount, ranging from a minimum of $15,000 to a maximum of $250,000.
The AQAF has enabled a number of businesses to obtain equipment
financing which might not otherwise have been able to obtain credit
and meet start-up costs.
<P>
The District created the Economic Development and Business Retention
(EDBR) office in 1992 in response to the economic downturn experienced
by the nation and particularly in Southern California. The primary
objective of the Economic Development and Business Retention office
is to facilitate the commercialization of new low-emitting technologies.
This creates jobs and helps to retain existing businesses through
introduction of and conversion to more efficient and less-polluting
technologies. The EDBR office has already helped approximately
500 companies with their compliance goals and has thus far helped
to create or retain an estimated 6000 or more jobs in Southern
California.<P>
<B>SCAG
Assistance 
</B>
<P>
SCAG has provided significant assistance and outreach to local
governments in understanding, assessing and implementing programs
to address TCM and air quality issues. Beginning in early 1993,
SCAG has provided funding to its thirteen subregions to help develop
policies and strategies and prepare monitoring programs which
address TCMs, air quality and mobility requirements--identifying
locally sensitive implementation options and continuing to develop
monitoring programs to report progress.
<P>
In cooperation with the District, SCAG helped create The Partnership
and the REACH Task Force as discussed previously in this chapter.
SCAG continues in an active role to implement new strategies to
improve air quality and mobility.
<H3><A NAME = "76">MONITORING</A>
</H3>

<P>
The 1997 AQMP sets the course for attaining the federal and state
air quality standards in the Basin. As the Plan is implemented,
it is essential to periodically assess the effectiveness of the
air pollution control programs in reducing emissions, and to determine
whether or not the Basin is still proceeding along the course
set forth in the AQMP. Monitoring the AQMP's effectiveness will
also be an integral part of preparing the annual rule work plan.
The monitoring report will provide the necessary information to
monitor for maximum feasible measures and expeditious adoption
schedule required by the CCAA.
<P>
It is equally important that the people who live and work in the
Basin be kept informed of the efforts being undertaken to improve
air quality, and of the extent to which air quality is improving
as a result. The monitoring report can provide this kind of feedback
to the Basin's residents.
<P>
Monitoring the effectiveness of the AQMP is required by the CCAA
(Health and Safety Code Sections 40924) and federal Clean Air
Act (Part D, Section 172). Specifically, the CCAA requires that
the District prepare and submit a report each year to the ARB
summarizing the Basin's progress in meeting the schedules for
developing, adopting, or implementing the air pollution control
measures contained in the Plan.
<P>
Every third year, the District is required to assess the overall
effectiveness of its air quality program, including determining
the quality of emission reductions achieved, and the rate of population
and industrial- and vehicular-related emissions growth compared
to the assumptions and goals contained in the Plan. The District
is also required to assess the extent of air quality improvement,
based upon ambient pollutant measurements and best available modeling
techniques. These reports are required by law to be adopted by
the District at a public hearing and to be transmitted to the
ARB.
<P>
The federal Clean Air Act also requires nonattainment areas, such
as the Basin, to document &quot;reasonable further progress&quot;
in achieving incremental reductions of air pollution.
<P>
SCAG, with the assistance of county transportation commissions
and subregions, prepares the portion of the monitoring reports
that pertain to local government transportation and land use measures
and submits those portions to the District for inclusion in the
full monitoring reports.

<H3><a name = "61">INTRODUCTION
</H3>

<P>
The 1997 AQMP is designed to satisfy: 1) the State Implementation
Plan (SIP) requirements under Title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA)
and 2) Plan requirements of the California Clean Air Act (CCAA).
The emphasis of this Plan is to meet federal CAA requirements
for PM10 that are due by February 8, 1997 and to meet CCAA requirements
to prepare a comprehensive plan update by December 31, 1997. In
addition, based on new technical information, previous SIP submittals
such as the 1994 California Ozone SIP and the Carbon Monoxide
SIP are updated as part of this Plan.
<P>
The District has authority over the South Coast Air Basin (Basin)
and this Plan satisfies the PM10 attainment demonstration requirements
of the federal CAA, which is classified as a serious nonattainment
area for PM10. In addition, the District has jurisdiction over
the Coachella Valley located in the Salton Sea Air Basin and the
Los Angeles County portion of the Mojave Desert Air Basin. The
Coachella Valley is also designated as a serious nonattainment
area for PM10. A separate Coachella Valley Maintenance Plan will
be submitted to meet federal CAA requirements for this area (see
Chapter 8). The Los Angeles County portion of the Mojave Desert
Air Basin, known as the Antelope Valley, is currently unclassified
for PM10 and there are no state or federal PM10 planning requirements.
<P>
The 1994 AQMP satisfied the ozone attainment and VOC rate-of-progress
demonstration requirements of the CAA for the South Coast Air
Basin, Antelope Valley, and Coachella Valley. The 1994 AQMP addressed
the separate ozone attainment and VOC rate-of-progress demonstrations
for each of these areas. Based on the control strategy provided
in Chapter 4, ozone attainment and rate-of-progress demonstrations
are presented in this chapter for the South Coast Air Basin and
in Chapter 8 for the Antelope Valley and Coachella Valley.
<H3><a name = "62">FEDERAL
CLEAN AIR ACT REQUIREMENTS</H3>

<b>PM10 Planning Requirements</b>

<P>
Results of ambient air quality monitoring data indicate that the
Basin exceeds federal and state standards for PM10. These microscopically
fine particles can originate from several industrial processes,
including direct emission and atmospheric chemical reactions which
convert gases into particles (referred to as &quot;secondary&quot;
particulates), and from a variety of fugitive dust sources, both
natural and man-made. In the western portions of the Basin, secondary
particulates account for about 45 percent of the annual average
PM10, while soil dust (referred to as &quot;fugitive dust&quot;)
accounts for about 30 percent. In the eastern portion of the Basin,
the contributions from secondary particulates and fugitive dust
are approximately 40 percent each. Mobile sources also contribute
directly to ambient PM10 levels through tailpipe emissions and,
indirectly, through resuspension of paved road dust.
<P>
Under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments the South Coast Air Basin
was originally classified as a &quot;moderate&quot; PM10 nonattainment
area. In response to State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal
requirements of the CAA for &quot;moderate&quot; areas, the District
submitted applicable portions of the 1991 AQMP to the U.S. EPA
prior to the November 15, 1991 statutory deadline. In accordance
with the CAA requirements for moderate PM10 nonattainment areas,
the moderate area PM10 SIP submittal proposed the implementation
of &quot;reasonably available control measures&quot; (RACM) for
fugitive dust sources, and relied upon the AQMP for reductions
in precursor gaseous emissions as part of the ozone attainment
plan. Modeling contained in the moderate area PM10 SIP demonstrated
that the Basin would not attain the PM10 standards by December
1994 and would subsequently be reclassified as a &quot;serious&quot;
nonattainment area. In February 1993, EPA reclassified the Basin
from a &quot;moderate&quot; to a &quot;serious&quot; nonattainment
area for PM10. The moderate area SIP further showed that the complexity
of the problem was of sufficient magnitude that the PM10 standards
could not be attained by 2001 -- the deadline for serious nonattainment
areas. The CAA provides a maximum five year extension to the attainment
date for those areas that cannot meet the 2001 date after all
best available control measures (BACM) have been implemented by
1997; thus making 2006 the latest attainment year possible. The
District has shown in the 1994 AQMP that it will need until 2006
to meet the federal PM10 standards.
<P>
CAA Section 189(b)(2) requires areas reclassified as serious to
submit a SIP revision within 18 months of a reclassification.
For the Basin, the PM10 BACM SIP, submitted as part of the 1994
AQMP, met this requirement.<P>
<b>Current PM10 Requirements</b>

<P>
For areas such as the Basin that are classified as serious nonattainment
for PM10, Section 189(b)(3) defines major PM10 sources that would
be subject to CAA major source requirements. Sections 189(e) and
189(b)(1)(B) of the CAA require the implementation of &quot;best
available control technology&quot; (BACT) for point sources of
PM10 and precursor emissions (i.e., precursors of secondary particulates)
and BACM for area sources of fugitive dust by February 8, 1997.
U.S. EPA guidance also states that, in instances where mobile
sources contribute significantly to the area's exceedance of federal
PM10 standards, transportation control measures (TCMs) are also
to be included as part of the PM10 SIP submittal. An attainment
demonstration for PM10 is required by the CAA as part of the SIP
submittal due February 8, 1997. Section 189(c) requires the establishment
of emission reduction milestones. Lastly, contingency measures
for PM10, in the event of failure to meet emission reduction milestones
or achieve attainment, are also required as part of the SIP submittal.
<H4>Major
PM10 Source Requirements</H4>

<P>
Section 189(b)(3) of the CAA defines a major source of PM10 as
any stationary source that emits or has a potential to emit at
least 70 tons per year of PM10. These major sources then would
be subject to major source requirements contained in the CAA.
District Rule 1302(p) defines major PM10 sources in accordance
with the CAA, making them subject to the major source requirements
under New Source Review (NSR).
<H4>BACT for Point Sources</H4>

<P>
As mentioned in the 1994 AQMP, BACT for point sources of PM10
and PM10 precursors is presently addressed through the District's
NSR and RECLAIM programs (District Rules 1303 and 2005).
<H4>BACM for Fugitive Dust Sources</H4>

<P>
For fugitive dust sources, the selection of BACM to be implemented
must be based on a combination of technical feasibility, cost-effectiveness,
and energy/environmental considerations; the selected BACM controls
must be implemented by February 8, 1997. These candidate BACM
are generally similar to the RACM (Reasonably Available Control
Measure) strategy adopted in District Rule 403, except that they
are elevated to a higher level of stringency. This is consistent
with U.S. EPA policy, which states that &quot;... more stringent
control measures are needed in cases when the current control
requirements will be insufficient to bring a particular area into
attainment.&quot; The District developed a list of candidate BACM
as part of the 1994 PM10 BACM SIP submittal. These measures have
been refined and updated for the 1997 AQMP. The following is a
list of candidate BACM that are being considered as part of the
1997 PM10 SIP revision (a complete description of the candidate
BACM can be found in Appendix IV, Section 1):

</PRE>

<P>
In the 1994 PM10 BACM SIP, the District committed to adopt all
identified candidate BACM via rulemaking action by December 31,
1996 and implement these BACM by February 8, 1997. However, any
candidate measure may not be adopted if it is determined prior
to September 1996 that such candidate BACM does not meet the technological
and cost feasibility criteria for BACM acceptability. Such criteria
are defined in Chapter 4.
<P>
To complete the technological and cost feasibility analyses, the
District has undertaken the following actions:
<OL>
<LI>Participated in a fast-track emissions inventory update, as
indicated in the Emissions Inventory Update Workplan, coordinated
through the BACM SIP Working Group. This effort provided data
on missing and incomplete fugitive dust source categories and
processes. In addition, the District supplemented this effort
through the PM10 Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP) emission
inventory projects.
<LI>The District compiled a revised baseline inventory for the
fugitive dust emission sources and completed the revised inventory
process, discussed in Chapter 3.
<LI>Based on the revised emissions inventory and other available
information, each of the candidate BACM are being evaluated for
cost-effectiveness and control efficiency. The District has completed
the BACM technological and cost feasibility analysis prior to
July 1996. As discussed in Chapter 4, BCM-01(a/b/c), BCM-03, BCM-04,
and BCM-06 meet both the technological and cost feasibility criteria.
<LI>The District has identified those candidate BACM not meeting
either the technological or cost feasibility criteria. Those candidate
BACM, described in Chapter 9, are included as PM10 contingency
measures. These measures are CTY-12 (formerly BCM-01d/e), CTY-13
(formerly BCM-02), and CTY-14 (formerly BCM-05).
</OL>

<P>
The results of the initial feasibility and cost-effectiveness
analysis are also discussed in Chapter 4. The federal CAA requires
that the BACM and related contingency measures be adopted and
implemented by February 8, 1997. The 1994 AQMP provided for the
adoption of these measures by December 31, 1996. The BACM and
contingency measures are under rule development as Proposed Amendments
to Rule 403 (PAR 403) and Proposed Rule 1186 (PR 1186) and are
scheduled to be considered for adoption in early 1997.
<H4>Transportation Control Measures</H4>

<P>
Transportation control measures meeting the CAA requirements have
been submitted in previous SIPs, including the 1994 California
Ozone SIP. Updated transportation control measures necessary of
attainment of the federal PM10 and ozone standards are described
in Appendix IV, Section 3.
<H4>PM10 Attainment Demonstration</H4>

<P>
Section 189(b)(1)(a) of the CAA requires a PM10 attainment demonstration.
The results of the attainment demonstration are summarized in
Chapter 5. The air quality modeling used for the PM10 attainment
demonstration is described in Appendix V.
<H4>Establishing PM10 Milestone Targets</H4>

<P>
Section 189(c) of the CAA requires the establishment of PM10 milestone
targets. The future milestone years for PM10 are 2000, 2003, and
2006. The milestone targets are set based on expected emission
reductions in the target years. The PM10 milestone targets are
shown in Table 6-1 and Appendix V.

<H4>Contingency Measures for PM10</H4>

<P>
The federal CAA requires PM10 contingency measures to be implemented
in the event of failure to meet milestone emission reduction targets
and/or failure to attain the standard by the attainment date in
2006. The PM10 contingency measures are those BACM measures that
have failed either the technical feasibility or cost-effectiveness
criteria or both. For the 1997 AQMP, those measures that have
failed the criteria based on initial estimates of feasibility
and cost-effectiveness are listed in Chapter 9. In addition to
the fugitive dust contingency measures, other contingency measures
for ozone serve as contingency for PM10 to reduce VOCs and oxides
of nitrogen which are precursors to particulate organics and nitrates.
The full descriptions of each of the PM10 contingency measures
are contained in Appendix IV, Section 6.
<P><b>Other Federal Clean Air Act Requirements</b>

<P>
This section describes how the 1997 AQMP meets the major ozone
planning requirements of the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) for the
South Coast Air Basin. The requirements specifically addressed
here are:
<UL>
<LI>the post-1996 VOC rate-of-progress requirements,
<LI>the ozone attainment demonstration,
<LI>the contingency measure requirements, and
<LI>the average vehicle occupancy requirement.
</UL>

<H3>Post-1996
VOC Rate-of-Progress</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="rfp">The reasonable further progress requirements in
the CAA are intended to ensure that each ozone nonattainment area
provide for sufficient precursor emission reductions to attain
the ozone national ambient air quality standard. More specifically,
Section 182(c)(2) requires that each serious and above ozone nonattainment
area achieve actual VOC emission reductions of at least three
percent per year averaged over each consecutive 3-year period
beginning 6 years after enactment of the Act until the area's
attainment date (i.e., November 15, 2010 for the South Coast Air
Basin). This is called the &quot;post-1996 rate-of-progress&quot;
requirement of the CAA.</A> 
<P>
According to <A NAME="temp3">Section 182(c)(2)(C), actual oxides
of nitrogen (NOx) emission reductions which occur after 1990 can
be used to meet post-1996 VOC emission reduction requirements
provided the NOx reductions satisfy the following criteria. First,
the control strategy used to demonstrate attainment must consist
of both VOC and NOx control measures. More specifically, the mix
of VOC and NOx emission reductions used to satisfy the post-1996
rate-of-progress requirements of the CAA must be consistent with
the controlled VOC and NOx emission levels used in the modeling
demonstration. And lastly, the combined annual VOC and NOx reductions
must average 3 percent per year.</A> 
<P>
The post-1996 rate-of-progress demonstration is presented in Appendix
V; Figure 6-1 and Table 6-2 summarize the results. Shown in the
figure are the VOC (Figure 6-1a) and NOx (Figure 6-1b) emission
target levels and the projected uncontrolled baseline. Controlled
emission levels are not shown since the VOC and NOx emission reductions
from existing District and ARB rules are sufficient to meet the
CAA rate-of-progress requirements.
<P>
<A NAME="attain">For the milestone years 1999 and 2002, the baseline
VOC emission levels are below the target levels. Beginning in
2005, the VOC reductions in the baseline are insufficient and
NOx substitution is necessary and allowed according to Section
182(c)(2)(C) of the CAA. The proposed reduction rates for milestone
years are shown in Table 6-2. These rates are determined by applying
all the creditable VOC reductions at each milestone and providing
sufficient NOx reductions to satisfy VOC reduction requirements
of Section 182(c)(2). Note that NOx substitution is used to satisfy
most of the post-1996 rate-of-progress requirements after the
year 2002.</A>

Post-1996 Rate-of-Progress Requirements
<P><b>Ozone Attainment Demonstration</b>

<P>
Under the Clean Air Act, air quality modeling is an integral part
of the planning process to achieve clean air. Specifically, Section
182(b)(1)(A) requires that moderate and above ozone nonattainment
areas must reduce VOC and NOx emissions sufficiently to attain
the national ambient air quality standard for ozone. It is not
sufficient for extreme ozone nonattainment areas to meet the post-1996
rate-of-progress requirements of the CAA; extreme ozone nonattainment
areas, such as the Basin, must also demonstrate attainment by
November 15, 2010. This may result in emission reductions in addition
to those required by the reasonable further progress components
of the CAA [i.e., Sections 182(b)(1) and 182(c)(2)]. In this Plan,
the modeling requirements are met by applying the U.S. EPA-recommended
photochemical grid model called the Urban Airshed Model (UAM)
using U.S. EPA-approved modeling techniques.
<P>
A summary of the ozone attainment demonstration is provided in
Table 5-2 of Chapter 5. The ozone attainment demonstration is
fully described in Appendix V.
<P><b>Contingency
Measures</b>

<P>
Section 172(c)(9) of the 1990 CAA requires that the plan shall
provide for implementation of specific measures in the event an
area fails to make reasonable further progress or to attain the
applicable standards by the specified dates. Such measures shall
be included in the Plan revision as contingency measures to take
effect without further action by the State or the Administrator.
Measures which cannot be fully adopted by the time EPA acts on
the Plan will be adopted within one year of EPA approval to satisfy
conditional approval requirement of Section 110(k)(4). Section
182(c)(9) refers to contingency measures if the area does not
achieve the applicable milestone; these measures are required
to be submitted along with the November 15, 1994 ozone attainment
demonstration. The District has already adopted a CO contingency
measure, Rule 1504, parking cash-out, which implements existing
state law.
<P>
Section 187(a)(3) of the 1990 CAA requires that adopted and enforceable
contingency measures be included in the carbon monoxide attainment
demonstration plan submittal (see Appendix IV). Contingency measures
are required for carbon monoxide attainment planning, to be implemented
if the area fails to attain the federal standard by the designated
attainment date or fails to achieve the specific annual emission
reductions necessary for attainment. A deviation from the forecasted
VMT of more than a given percentage triggers implementation of
contingency measures to offset either excess VMT or carbon monoxide
emissions due to the additional VMT or equivalent emissions. According
to the EPA General Preamble [Section 532(c)(1)], this percentage
is three percent for 1997 and subsequent years or other appropriate
values. The cumulative VMT growth cannot be greater than or equal
to five percent above the VMT forecast used as the basis of the
attainment demonstration.
<P>
A list of the contingency measures developed for these CAA requirements
is provided in Chapter 9.<A NAME="cm"></A><P> 
<b>Average
Vehicle Occupancy Requirements (AVO)</b>

<P>
Section 182 (d)(1)(A) of the CAA requires the District to include
in the Plan transportation control measures that offset any growth
in emissions from growth in vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled
and attain reduction of mobile source emissions. Such control
measures must be developed in accordance with the guidelines listed
in Section 108(f) of the CAA. The programs listed in Section 108(f)
of the CAA include, but are not limited to, transit improvement
projects, traffic flow improvement projects, the construction
of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities and other mobile source
emission reduction programs. Transportation Control Measure -
01, Transportation Improvements included in Appendix IV of the
1997 AQMP, has been developed to meet the requirements of Section
182(d)(1)(A) and 108(f) of the CAA and includes the capital-based
and non-capital-based facilities, projects and programs contained
in the Regional Mobility Element and programmed through the RTIP
process. As an additional measure of reducing mobile source emissions,
Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the CAA allows the implementation of employer-based
trip reduction programs that are aimed at improving the average
vehicle occupancy (AVO) rates. As an alternative to trip reduction
programs, Section 182(d)(1)(B) also allows the substitution of
these programs with alternative programs that achieve equivalent
emission reductions. Rule 2202 - On-Road Motor Vehicle Mitigation
Options, adopted in December 1995, was developed to comply with
the CAA requirements and was submitted to EPA for approval.
<H3><a name = "63">CARBON
MONOXIDE ATTAINMENT DEMONSTRATION</H3>

<P>
The South Coast Air Basin is designated as a serious nonattainment
area for carbon monoxide (CO) under the federal Clean Air Act
and is required to implement emissions reduction measures as &quot;expeditiously
as practicable&quot; in order to attain federal carbon monoxide
standards by December 31, 2000. A Federal Attainment Plan for
Carbon Monoxide was approved by the District Governing Board on
November 12, 1992 and submitted to the U.S. EPA. The Plan was
revised for the 1994 AQMP as discussed in Appendix I-F of the
1994 Plan. It should be noted that the state 1-hour CO standard
was met for the first time in the Basin in 1995, so CO air quality
continues to improve. It is necessary to revise the CO Plan in
the 1997 AQMP due to new VMT and emissions data and adjustments
to the control strategy. As discussed in Chapter 5, the modeling
results indicate that the state and federal 8-hour CO standards
are projected to be met in 2000 through existing District and
ARB rules. The proposed control strategy will get some additional
CO air quality improvement. The revised CO attainment demonstration
is contained in Appendix V.
<P>
As part of the federal Clean Air Act requirements under Section
187(d)(1), a carbon monoxide milestone demonstration was submitted
to U.S. EPA in March 1996. However, the submittal was based on
emissions estimates from the 1994 Plan. A commitment was made
to submit carbon monoxide emissions as of December 31, 1995 for
all sources with the adoption of the 1997 AQMP. The carbon monoxide
emissions inventory for 1995 is provided in Appendix V.
<H3><a name = "64">1997 NITROGEN DIOXIDE MAINTENANCE PLAN</H3>

<P>
Under the CAA, an area can be redesignated as attainment if, among
other requirements, the U.S. EPA determines that the NAAQS have
been attained. Section 175A of the CAA states that any district
that submits a request under Section 107(d) for redesignation
of a nonattainment area to attainment must submit a revision of
the applicable SIP that demonstrates attainment for at least 10
years after the redesignation. U.S. EPA guidance states that a
determination of compliance with the NAAQS must be based on three
complete, consecutive calendar years of quality-assured air quality
monitoring data.
<P>
Over the past three years (1993 through 1995), ambient nitrogen
dioxide measurements in the South Coast Air Basin have shown that
annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations are below the federal air
quality standard of 0.053 ppm. As such, based on the ambient nitrogen
dioxide measurements and the demonstration shown in Chapter 5
that the Basin will maintain the federal nitrogen dioxide air
quality standard with the projected baseline future-year emissions,
this Plan serves as the Nitrogen Dioxide Maintenance Plan for
the South Coast Air Basin.
<H3><a name = "65">CALIFORNIA CLEAN AIR ACT REQUIREMENTS</H3>

<P>
The California Clean Air Act established a number of legal mandates
to facilitate achieving health-based state air quality standards
at the earliest practicable date. The following CCAA requirements
are addressed in the remainder of this chapter:
<P>
(1) Demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the air quality program;
<P>
(2) Reduce nonattainment pollutants at a rate of five percent
per year, or include all feasible measures and an expeditious
adoption schedule;
<P>
(3) Ensure no net increase in emissions from new or modified stationary
sources;
<P>
(4) Reduce population exposure to severe nonattainment pollutants
according to a prescribed schedule;
<P>
(5) Include any other feasible controls that can be implemented,
or for which implementation can begin, within 10 years of adoption;
and
<P>
(6) Rank control measures by cost-effectiveness.
<P><b>Plan
Effectiveness </b>

<P>
The CCAA requires, beginning on December 31, 1994 and every three
years thereafter, that the District demonstrate the overall effectiveness
of its air quality program [H&amp;SC 40924(b)]. Trends in the
following air quality indicators are used to demonstrate the recent
(i.e., for the three preceding years) effectiveness of the District's
program:
<OL>
<LI>VOC, NOx, and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions;
<LI>NO2, CO and ozone exceedance days; and
<LI>NO2, CO, and ozone population exposure.
</OL>

<P>
Trends in Basin-wide VOC, NOx, and CO emissions since 1993 are
shown in Chapter 3. Since 1993 VOC, NOx, and CO emissions have
decreased by 3 percent, 3 percent, and 5 percent, respectively,
due to current efforts. These decreases have occurred in spite
of strong population growth over the period.
<P>
The percent of days exceeding state standards in 1990 through
1995 for ozone, CO, and PM10 air quality are illustrated in Figure
6-2. Even over this relatively short time period, it is evident
that air quality has improved in the Basin.
<P>
Trends in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air quality are not shown in
Figure 6-2; however, improvement in that pollutant is also evident
in the last six years. The federal annual NO2 standard was met
for the first time in 1992 and the standard has been met every
year since. Since 1993, the South Coast Air Basin has not experienced
any exceedances of the state NO2 air quality standard and the
region has been redesignated to attainment for the state NO2 air
quality standard. The reader is referred to Appendix II for a
more comprehensive discussion of local air quality trends.
<P>
<B>FIGURE 6-2</B> 
<P>
Percent of Days Exceeding State Standard
<P>
Trends in population exposure are shown in Table 6-3. Population
exposure is a particularly good indicator of air quality trends
since it takes into account spatial and temporal changes in air
quality. For example, per-capita population exposure reflects
the length of time the Basin population is exposed to unhealthful
air quality. Table 6-3 shows the per-capita exposure to ozone,
CO, and NO2 for the historical period 1986-88 and for two recent
years, 1993 and 1995. The per-capita levels shown in the table
represent average exposure above the state 1-hour standard levels
for each pollutant.

</PRE>
<HR>

<P>
*Exposures to 8-hr CO conditions are not calculated, but are estimated
to be close to zero.
<P>
The table clearly shows that the per-capita exposure to ozone,
carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide has decreased dramatically
since the 1986-88 period. The Basin is below the state 1-hour
NO2 standard, therefore the per-capita exposure to NO2 is zero.
The per-capita exposure to the state 8-hour CO standard is also
near zero, since the Basin is, for the most part, in attainment
of the standard. In 1995, the 8-hour CO standard was exceeded
in the south-central Los Angeles area and the San Fernando Valley.
<P>
In summary, the trends of all the indicators show improved air
quality in the South Coast Air Basin over the last five to eight
years; the population is being exposed to unhealthful air quality
less and less each year. These air quality improvements are the
direct result of AQMP implementation.
<P><b>Emission
Reductions</b>

<P>
The ARB has developed &quot;planning inventories&quot; to characterize
emissions during periods when air quality standards are exceeded
and to serve as the basis for emissions reduction accounting (see
Chapter 3). As shown in Chapter 3, the planning inventories are
2 to 5 percent higher than the comparable annual average emission
inventories. This difference is primarily due to seasonal temperature
changes and the corresponding effects on pollutant emissions rates
(e.g., higher solvent and gasoline evaporative emissions on hot
summer days; more fuel combustion on cold days).
<P>
Table 6-4 presents baseline emissions and estimated emission reductions
for the reporting years 1997 and 2000. These estimates are based
on the adoption and implementation schedules contained in Chapter
7. As seen in the table, the proposed control strategy falls short
of the CCAA emission reduction goals (i.e., five percent per year
for all nonattainment pollutants) for all pollutants for all years
even with the implementation of maximum feasible controls and
an expeditious adoption schedule. Nonetheless, the strategy represents
the all feasible control measures and an expeditious adoption
schedule as permitted under H&amp;S Code 40914.

<P>
*Emission reductions are estimated as the 1990 equivalent. Percent

<P><b>Population
Exposure</b>

<P>
The CCAA also requires a reduction in overall population exposure
to criteria pollutants. Specifically, exposure to severe nonattainment
pollutants above standards must be reduced by at least:
<OL>
<LI>25 percent by December 31, 1994;
<LI>40 percent by December 31, 1997; and
<LI>50 percent by December 31, 2000.
</OL>

<P>
Reductions are to be calculated based on per-capita exposure and
the severity of exceedances. This provision is applicable to ozone,
CO and NO2 in the Basin [H&amp;SC 40920(c)]. The definition of
exposure is the number of persons exposed to a specific pollutant
concentration level above the state standard times the number
of hours exposed. The per-capita exposure is the population exposure
(units of pphm-persons-hours) divided by the total population.
<P><b>Methodology
</b>

<P>
For the 1997 AQMP, the Regional Human Exposure (REHEX) model is
used to estimate per-capita exposure reduction. It considers population
mobility; time spent indoors, outdoors and in transit; exposure
by age classification; and activity pattern by season and weekday/weekend.
In addition, REHEX utilizes future-year predicted ozone concentrations
from the Urban Airshed Model (UAM) to project population exposure.
The methodology and the model are discussed in more detail in
Appendix V of the 1997 AQMP and in Technical Report V-H of the
1991 AQMP.
<P><b>Ozone</b>

<P>
An analysis using the REHEX model indicates that the CCAA exposure
reduction targets will be achieved for ozone with a margin of
safety. Thus, public health will be significantly improved with
the implementation of the 1997 AQMP. Figure 6-3 summarizes the
results and compares estimated exposure reductions to the targets.
The exposure reductions shown in 1997 are the actual population
exposures in 1995. Actual exposures in 1995 serve as better indicators
of the 1997 exposure than model-predicted estimates.

* 1997 exposure based on actual 1995 data.

The REHEX model also allows more detailed exposure reduction estimates
disaggregated by age group and county. These results are summarized
in Figures 6-and 6-5, respectively. As shown, the greatest exposure
reduction for an individual age class is for children, who have
longer exposure to outdoor concentrations; the geographic location
with the most improvement for all age groups is that comprised
of the two inland counties.
<p><b>Carbon
Monoxide</b>

<P>
The REHEX modeling results for CO are shown in Figure 6-6. As
shown, the proposed control strategy will greatly exceed the CCAA
reduction requirements for CO exposure. As discussed in Chapter
5 and in Appendix V, the 1-hour and 8-hour CO standards are projected
to be met by the year 2000. Therefore, the Basin population will
not be exposed to unhealthful CO levels and thus per capita exposure
is reduced 100 percent from the 1986-88 base levels. The exposure
reductions shown in 1997 are the actual population exposures in
1995 and as discussed earlier the 1-hour CO standard was met for
the first time in 1995.

As discussed earlier, the 1-hour NO2 standard was met in 1994
and 1995. In addition, the NOx reductions from existing District
and ARB rules assure that the NO2 standards will continue to be
met (see Chapter 5). Therefore, since 1994 and projected into
the future the Basin's population will not be exposed to unhealthful
levels of NO2. The CCAA exposure goals have been satisfied through
the District's AQMP.
<p><b>Cost
Effectiveness Ranking</b>

<P>
The CCAA requires the District Governing Board to determine that
the AQMP is a cost-effective strategy that will achieve attainment
of the state standards by the earliest practicable date [H&amp;SC
40913(b)]. In addition, the Plan must include an assessment of
the cost-effectiveness of available and proposed measures and
a list of the measures ranked from the least cost-effective to
the most cost-effective [H&amp;SC 40922].
<P>
Table 6-5 and Table 6-6 provide a listing of the short- and intermediate-term
measures that have available cost information for stationary and
mobile source measures, respectively. The cost-effectiveness for
stationary source measures ranges from under $100 to as high as
$12,300 per ton of pollutant reduced. Two methods are used to
calculate the cost-effectiveness of the mobile source measures.
The ARB transmitted the cost-effectiveness values for the mobile
source measures based on incremental cost analyses, published
reports and other internal methods. However, the District uses
the Discount Cash Flow method in its calculations. The District
has been using the Discount Cash Flow method since the 1987 AQMP.
The Discount Cash Flow method is more versatile in analyzing complex
financial cash flows and is the most widely used cost methodology
by major businesses. In order to be consistent with the stationary
source method, the District recalculated the mobile source cost-effectiveness
values. Both sets of cost-effectiveness estimates are provided
for consistency with ARB reported values. The proposed implementation
schedule for these measures is provided in Chapter 7 and is based
on this information and other relevant factors.

<H3><a name = "101">INTRODUCTION</H3>

<P>
This Chapter presents additional analyses which have important
future considerations, but which are not currently required under
law to be included in the AQMP. Uncertainties associated with
the technical analysis provided in the AQMP are discussed in this
chapter. In addition, a first look at the year 2020 is provided.
The 2020 air quality analysis is provided for informational purposes
only and does not serve as a maintenance plan at this time. Lastly,
the District has attempted to anticipate certain future federal
requirements and has incorporated this information into the 1997
AQMP. In anticipation of federal changes regarding PM10 and ozone
ambient air quality standards, a preview of future technical considerations
and possible planning implications is provided in this chapter.
<H3><a name = "102">UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TECHNICAL ANALYSIS</H3>

<P>
As with any plan update there are uncertainties associated with
the technical analysis. Projecting air quality concentrations
into the future has associated uncertainties. These uncertainties
exist in the demographic and growth projections for the future
base years. As projections are made to longer periods (i.e., over
ten or more years), the uncertainty of the projections become
greater. Examples of these types of uncertainties include:
<UL>
<LI>the location of new sources;
<LI>military base reuse plans; and
<LI>economic prosperity.
</UL>

<P>
In addition to the above, there are also uncertainties in the
technical information gathered for the air quality analysis. The
three major input elements of any air quality modeling analysis
(ambient air quality monitoring data, meteorological measurements,
and emissions inventory) all have various levels of uncertainties.
Generally, ambient air quality measurements are within plus or
minus half of a unit of measurement (e.g., for ozone usually reported
in units of pphm would be accurate to within 0.5 pphm). Due to
this uncertainty, the Basin's ozone attainment status based on
ambient monitoring data would be achieved if all ozone monitors
reported ozone concentration levels less than or equal to 12.4
pphm. Examples of meteorological uncertainties include:
<UL>
<LI>averaging of instantaneous wind speeds and directions to hourly
averaged values and
<LI>directional consistency during low (stagnant) wind conditions.
</UL>

<P>
As discussed in Chapter 3, large uncertainties in the mobile source
emissions inventory estimates have been observed as evident with
the latest EMFAC7G release. On-road mobile source emission estimates
have increased with each new EMFAC release. On-road mobile source
emissions have inherent uncertainties also with the current methodologies
used to estimate vehicle activity such as vehicle miles traveled.
Stationary (or point) source emission estimates have less associated
uncertainties compared to area source emission estimates. Major
stationary sources report emissions annually whereas area source
emissions are, in general, estimated based on sales or population
information.
<P>
The air quality model used for ozone air quality analysis (the
Urban Airshed Model) is a sophisticated, complex 3-dimensional
model requiring 3-dimensional meteorological data. Meteorological
measurements collected at various locations throughout the Basin
are used to generate 3-dimensional flow fields. In addition to
uncertainties in model input data, air quality models contain
inherent uncertainties due to the model formulations which rely
on numerical methods to solve complex mathematical equations of
motion. Examples of these types of uncertainty sources are as
follows:
<OL>
<LI>Estimations of 3-dimensional wind fields from a limited number
of measurements.
<LI>Chemical reactions based on experimental data.
<LI>Application of numerical solutions to complex physical processes.
</OL>

<P>
It should be noted that uncertainties run in two directions and
comparisons with recent year projections show that the air quality
is improving at a greater rate than was projected. This would
indicate that uncertainties are not significantly affecting the
integrity of the Plan.
<P>
Furthermore, the concerns regarding uncertainties in the technical
analysis are reduced with future AQMP revisions. For each AQMP
revision, the best available technical information is used. Under
state law, the AQMP revision process is a dynamic process with
revisions occurring every three years. The AQMP revision represents
a &quot;snapshot in time&quot; providing the progress achieved
since the previous AQMP revision and efforts still needed in order
to attain air quality standards.
<P>
Under the federal Clean Air Act, a state implementation plan (SIP)
is prepared for each criteria pollutant. The SIP is not updated
on a routine basis under the federal Clean Air Act. However, the
federal Clean Air Act recognizes that uncertainties do exist and
provides safeguards if a nonattainment area does not meet an applicable
milestone or attain federal air quality standards by their applicable
dates. Contingency (or backstop) measures are required in the
AQMP and must be developed into regulations such that they will
take effect if a nonattainment area does not meet an applicable
milestone or attainment date. In addition, federal sanctions may
be imposed until an area meets applicable milestone targets.
<P>
U.S. EPA recently released a guidance document on the use of modeled
results to demonstrate attainment of the federal ozone air quality
standard1 The guidance document recognized that there will be
uncertainties with ozone modeling analysis. For severe and extreme
ozone nonattainment areas, the U.S. EPA recommends that at least
one &quot;mid-course&quot; review of air quality, emissions and
modeled data be conducted. A second review, shortly before the
attainment date, should be conducted also.
<H3><A NAME = "103">A FIRST LOOK AT THE YEAR 2020 OZONE AIR QUALITY</H3>

<P>
With continued growth in the South Coast Air Basin beyond 2010,
concerns have been raised whether the South Coast Air Basin can
maintain the federal ozone air quality standard. As such, an ozone
air quality analysis for 2020 was performed. Data on the projected
growth in the Basin and surrounding areas were provided by SCAG.
Future year ozone air quality projections are provided in Figure
10-1.

<H3><a name = "104">POTENTIAL NEW AIR QUALITY STANDARDS FOR OZONE AND FINE PARTICULATES
</H3>

<P>
During the timeframe for development of the 1997 AQMP, the U.S.
EPA is reviewing the current air quality standards for ozone and
particulate matter. As part of the requirements of the CAA, every
five years the U.S. EPA must review the current ambient air quality
standards and propose revisions where necessary. This review process
includes a comprehensive evaluation of the latest health studies;
a redrafting, if appropriate, of the relevant pollutant criteria
document; and a staff report recommending the position of the
U.S. EPA staff. Both the criteria document and the staff report
are reviewed by the CAA-authorized Clean Air Science Advisory
Committee (CASAC), an independent panel of experts. Generally,
for the U.S. EPA to proceed with the new air quality standard
setting process, consensus approval must first be given by CASAC
on both the criteria document and the staff report. At this point
in time, these actions have occurred.
<P>
In the current process, both ozone and fine particulates are being
considered for new standards. The U.S. EPA in June 1996 issued
an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) regarding possible
new ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulates.
In the ANPR, U.S. EPA announced that proposed action would be
issued in November 1996. Should the proposed action include recommendations
for new standards, then final action would occur in June 1997.
If new standards are proposed, a new set of planning requirements
will also be proposed. Under the CAA, for new standards, new plans
must be developed within three to six years from the date of final
promulgation.
<p><b>Health Basis</b>

<P>
The U.S. EPA recently completed a review of the scientific and
technical information on the known and potential adverse health
effects of ozone and PM10 because results from recent studies
have suggested that attainment of the existing NAAQS for these
pollutants may not provide adequate public health protection.
A brief summary of the effects associated with these pollutant
exposures at levels observable in Southern California is presented.
A more detailed discussion of health effects is provided in Appendix
I.<p>
<b>Ozone</b>

<P>
People exercising outdoors, children and persons with preexisting
lung disease such as asthma are considered to be susceptible sub-groups
for ozone effects. Identified in human and/or animal studies with
varying exposure duration the adverse health effects which are
either induced by ozone or associated with ambient ozone exposures
include: breathing pattern changes; reduction in breathing capacity
and exercise performance; increase in airway resistance; susceptibility
to infections; excess hospital admissions and emergency room visits;
and acute inflammation of the respiratory tract including some
cellular changes.
<P>
The lowest range of ozone exposure within which lung functional
changes (decrease in breathing lung volumes and increase in airway
resistance) are observed is 0.08 to 0.12 ppm for 6-8 hours under
moderate exercising conditions. Under similar exposure conditions,
biochemical indicators of lung inflammation are induced in healthy
adults exposed to ozone in the range of 0.08 to 0.10 ppm. Excess
hospital admissions and emergency room visits are observed when
hourly ozone concentrations are as low as 0.08 to 0.10 ppm. Thus,
the attainment of the current NAAQS (0.12 ppm) is not likely to
prevent all the adverse effects indicated from ozone exposure.
<p><b>Particulate Matter</b>

<P>
The major categories of adverse health effects associated with
PM10 include: increase in mortality associated with acute and
chronic exposures; exacerbation of preexisting respiratory and
cardiovascular diseases leading to an increase in hospital admissions
and emergency room visits; school absences; work loss days and
restricted activity days; changes in lung function and structure;
and altered lung defense mechanisms.
<P>
A review and statistical analysis of recent population studies
published on acute adverse effects of PM10 indicates that an incremental
increase of PM10 by 10 &#181;g/m3 can lead to a significant increase
in both mortality and morbidity risks. The elderly, people with
preexisting respiratory and/or cardiovascular disease(s) and children
appear to be most susceptible to the effects of PM10. These findings
suggest that even when an area meets the existing NAAQS for PM10
the community is likely to continue to have the adverse impact
from ambient PM10 exposures.
<P>
A limited number of studies which have employed both PM10 and
PM2.5 indices for pollution suggest that the adverse effects show
a better correlation with the latter. A growing consensus exists
among the scientific community that the fine fraction of PM10
is relatively more toxic than the coarse fraction and is responsible
for the majority of PM10 effects observed.
<P>
In addition, U.S. EPA in its recent PM10 NAAQS review has concluded
that the difference in exposure relationships, and the strong
likelihood of fine mode fraction of PM10 being significant contributors
to PM-related health effects in sensitive populations, are sufficient
to justify the consideration of fine and coarse mode particles
in PM10 as separate classes of pollutants. Hence, U.S. EPA has
recommended additional PM2.5 NAAQS.
<p><b>Assessment of Potential New Standards</b>
<p>
<b>Ozone </b>

<P>
The U.S. EPA is considering replacing the current 1-hour federal
ozone standard of 0.12 ppm with an 8-hour standard. At this time,
U.S. EPA is considering the level of the standard to be in the
range of 0.07 to 0.09 ppm, with the most likely value at 0.08
ppm. In addition, U.S. EPA is considering a change in the form
of the standard, from an exceedance-based to a concentration-based
form. Under this scenario, if the 5th highest 8-hour average,
as averaged over the three most recent years of record, is above
0.08 ppm, then the area would be deemed to be in violation of
the standards. U.S. EPA is also considering the 2nd highest 8-hour
average, averaged over three years, and if the 2nd highest value
is below 0.08 ppm, then an area will be deemed to be in attainment
of the standard. What happens if an area records values between
these two bands has not been specifically delineated.
<P>
The District has evaluated the differences between the current
1-hour standard and the possible 8-hour standard for both 1995
(actual) and 2010 (projected). These are summarized in Table 10-3.
Currently, the 1-hour standards are exceeded by 116 percent. The
maximum 8-hour would exceed the possible new standard by 155 percent.
Future year projections show that the 1-hour standard would be
met in 2010, but the maximum 8-hour standard would still be exceeded
by 31 percent. Because federal guidance has not yet been developed
for modeling attainment demonstrations of a 5th highest value,
a projection of this value cannot be made at this time.

available.<p>
<b>Particulate Matter</b>

<P>
The U.S. EPA is currently recommending that new fine particulate
standards be established at a cut-point of 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5).
The latest recommendations would establish a PM2.5 annual average
at a value between 12.5 and 20 &#181;g/m3, and a PM2.5 24-hour
average at a value between 18 and 65 &#181;g/m3. The PM10 annual
average is likely to be retained, but the 24-hour PM10 standard
may be deleted.
<P>
A comparison of the current PM10 standards and the possible new
PM2.5 standards for 1995 and 2006 are shown in Table 10-4. The
1995 values are derived from the measurements taken during the
PTEP study; the 2006 PM2.5 values are estimated from the PM10
model application coupled with PM10-to-PM2.5 conversion factors
applied on a component basis, as derived from the PTEP data. Currently,
the PM10 standards are exceeded by 38 percent, and attainment
can be demonstrated by 2006. If the new PM2.5 standards are promulgated,
the PM2.5 annual standard in 2006 with the current control strategy
would be exceeded by 25 percent at the upper (or least stringent)
end of the range, while the 24-hour average would be exceeded
by 51 percent at the upper end of the range. At the lower end
of the range (most stringent), the percent above standards would
be 100 percent for the annual average, and 444 percent for the
24-hour average.

<HR>

<P>
It is also important in looking into the future to understand
the significant components of PM2.5 as projected for the year
2006. These are shown in Figure 10-2. The ammonium and nitrate
portions represent the dominant fraction of PM2.5 on both an annual
and episodic (24-hour) basis. Note, too, that the crustal component,
as identified within the category labeled &quot;others,&quot;
and which represents a significant fraction of PM10, plays a very
small role in the PM2.5 picture. For the 24-hour standard, it
is evident that significant reductions in ammonium nitrate will
be needed over and above the current PM10 control strategy in
order to attain a possible PM2.5 standard. Appreciable reductions
will also be needed for both organic and elemental carbon, the
former from VOC emissions and the latter from soot emissions,
primarily from diesel exhaust.

<P><b>Implementation</b>

<P>
With any new standard, U.S. EPA provides &quot;interim&quot; guidance
on the transition from the old to the new standard. To better
address the concerns and implications of a transition policy as
well as other implementation issues regarding ozone, fine particulates,
and regional haze, U.S. EPA has assembled an advisory committee
under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). The FACA Committee
represents over 50 representatives from state and local air regulatory
agencies, industry, environmental organizations, consulting organizations,
academia, and federal agencies. In addition, four subgroups have
been formed to focus on: (1) Base Programs and Policies; (2) National
and Regional Strategies; (3) Science and Technology; and (4) Communications
and Outreach. In addition, a Coordination work group integrates
the results from the subgroups. It is anticipated that U.S. EPA
will rely on the FACA process in developing new guidance and policies
should new standards be promulgated. The District staff are actively
participating/following the subgroup activities to ensure consideration
of South Coast Air Basin conditions.

<BLOCKQUOTE> A major air pollutant consisting of tiny solid or liquid particles, generally soot and aerosols.  The size of the particles (2.5 microns or smaller, about 0.0001 inches or less) allows them to easily enter the air sacs deep in the lungs where they may cause adverse health effects, as noted in several recent studies.  PM2.5 also causes visibility reduction, but is not considered a criteria air pollutant at this time.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><P>PSD (Prevention of Significant Deterioration): </B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>A program used in development of permits for new or modified industrial facilities in an area that is already in attainment.  The intent is to prevent an attainment area from becoming a non-attainment area.  This program, like NSR, can require BACT and, if an AAQS is projected to be exceeded, Emission Offsets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><P>PTEP (PM10 Technical Enhancement Program):</B>

<h4><i>New World Media</i> seeks to build a digital infrastructure for global
social transformation and information sharing.
</h4>
<h3>The Vision</h3>

Global distributed computing represents a significant and powerful transformation
in the way that individuals and institutions interact and evolve.
<p>
Fundamentally,
the technology is <i>decentralized</i> -- consumers become publishers.  There are NO
true filters.<p>
The new
medium is creating <i>radically different economies in publishing information</i> --
alternative media can go global.<p>
<i>Globalization of the technology</i> means that individual communities of resistance can
build and sustain effective <i>networks of resistance</i>.
<p>
<h3>The Tools</h3>

This service has been inspired by the works of Noam Chomsky, one of the world's leading
intellectuals and scientists, not to mention his status as one of America's, if not the
world's, leading dissidents.
<p>
Chomsky's work in analyzing the media, domestic and foreign affairs has inspired many
to work for social change.  His work has also begun to transform the way we approach media,
particularly the task of alternative media.  Lastly, this service is deeply informed by
the belief that any true or significant social change takes place through thousands of
small and dedicated efforts by people across the globe.  This service aims to be one
such effort.
<p>
Most of the New World Media Web consists of a rich set of content, including what is
becomming one of the world's most comprehensive archives of Chomsky's works.  In
conjunction with those materials are numerous and growing resources from crucial
alternative media organizations from around the world.  In addition to content, the service
offers users traditional conferencing and chat, where users can interact, share ideas,
and hopefully even organize.  An upcoming feature will be a weekly current affairs section,
where New World Media staff spin the weeks news and events onto the Web.
<p>
We hope our effort can enrich your world!
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
Jeremy Allaire<br>
New World Media

 The following is a preliminary set of links to an emerging
 network of left, anarchist, libertarian, and other grassroots
 efforts.  New World Media does not necessarily agree with or
 condone the viewpoints and agendas on any of the Web -- they
 are offered for context and information depth that extends beyond
 the scope of our service.<p>
 In coming weeks, this list will be substantially enhanced and
 reorganized around a rich database interface.  Others will be
 able to suggest and add links as well.<p>

<P><H3>Introduction</H3>


<P>Though Chomsky has written a considerable amount about anarchism in the
past three decades, people often ask him for a more tangible, detailed
vision of social change. His political analysis never fails to instill
outrage and anger with the way the world works, but many readers are left
uncertain about what exactly Chomsky would do to change it. Perhaps because
they regard his analytical work with such respect, they anticipate he will
lay out his goals and strategy with similar precision and clarity, only to
be disappointed with his generalized statements of libertarian socialist
values. Or perhaps many look to a great intellectual to provide a "master
plan" for them to follow step-by-step into a bright shining future.

<P>Yet Chomsky shys away from such pronouncements. He cautions that it is
difficult to predict what particular forms a more just social organization
will take, or even to know for sure what alternatives to the current system
are ideal. Only experience can show us the best answers to these questions,
he says. What should guide us along the way are a general set of principles
which will underly whatever specific forms our future society will take.
For Chomsky, those principles arise from the historical trend of thought and
action known as anarchism.


<P>Chomsky warns that little can be said about anarchism on a very general
level. "I haven't tried to write anything systematic about these topics, nor
do I know of anything by others that I could recommend," he wrote to me in
reply to a set of questions on the subject. He's written here and there
about it, notably in the recent <CITE><A HREF="../pp/pp.html">Powers and
Prospects</A>,</CITE> but there just isn't a lot to say in general terms.
"The interest lies in the applications," he thinks, "but these are specific
to time and place. 

 <P>"In Latin America," Chomsky says, "I talked about many of these topics,
and far more important, learned about them from people who are actually
doing things, a good deal of which had an anarchist flavor. Also had a
chance to meet with lively and interesting groups of anarchists, from Buenos
Aires to Belem at the mouth of the Amazon (the latter I didn't know about at
all -- amazing where our friends show up). But the discussions were much
more focused and specific than I often see here; and rightly, I think." 



<P>As such, Chomsky's responses to these questions are general and terse.
However, as a brief introduction to some of his thoughts on anarchism,
perhaps they may inspire the reader to pursue other writings on the subject
(a list appears at the end of the questions), and more importantly, to
<I>develop</I> the concept of anarchism through the process of working for
revolutionary social change. 


<P><A HREF="mailto:tl001c@uhura.cc.rochester.edu"><I>Tom Lane</I></A>

<P><HR>

<P><H3><B>Answers from Chomsky to eight questions on anarchism</B></H3>

<P><B>General comment on all the questions:</B>

<P>No one owns the term
"anarchism." It is used for a wide range of different currents of
thought and action, varying widely. There are many self-styled
anarchists who insist, often with great passion, that theirs is
the only right way, and that others do not merit the term (and
maybe are criminals of one or another sort). A look at the
contemporary anarchist literature, particularly in the West and
in intellectual circles (they may not like the term), will
quickly show that a large part of it is denunciation of others
for their deviations, rather as in the Marxist-Leninist sectarian
literature. The ratio of such material to constructive work is
depressingly high.

<P>Personally, I have no confidence in my own views about the "right
way," and am unimpressed with the confident pronouncements of
others, including good friends. I feel that far too little is
understood to be able to say very much with any confidence. We
can try to formulate our long-term visions, our goals, our
ideals; and we can (and should) dedicate ourselves to working on
issues of human significance. But the gap between the two is
often considerable, and I rarely see any way to bridge it except
at a very vague and general level. These qualities of mine
(perhaps defects, perhaps not) will show up in the (very brief)
responses I will make to your questions.

<P><B>1. What are the intellectual roots of anarchist thought, and what movements have developed and animated it throughout history?</B>

<P>The currents of anarchist thought that interest me (there are
many) have their roots, I think, in the Enlightenment and
classical liberalism, and even trace back in interesting ways to
the scientific revolution of the 17th century, including aspects
that are often considered reactionary, like Cartesian
rationalism. There's literature on the topic (historian of ideas
Harry Bracken, for one; I've written about it too). Won't try to
recapitulate here, except to say that I tend to agree with the
important anarchosyndicalist writer and activist Rudolf Rocker
that classical liberal ideas were wrecked on the shoals of
industrial capitalism, never to recover (I'm referring to Rocker
in the 1930s; decades later, he thought differently). The ideas
have been reinvented continually; in my opinion, because they
reflect real human needs and perceptions. The Spanish Civil War
is perhaps the most important case, though we should recall that
the anarchist revolution that swept over a good part of Spain in
1936, taking various forms, was not a spontaneous upsurge, but
had been prepared in many decades of education, organization,
struggle, defeat, and sometimes victories. It was very
significant. Sufficiently so as to call down the wrath of every
major power system: Stalinism, fascism, western liberalism, most
intellectual currents and their doctrinal institutions -- all
combined to condemn and destroy the anarchist revolution, as they
did; a sign of its significance, in my opinion.

<P><B>2. Critics complain that anarchism is "formless, utopian." You counter that each stage of history has its own forms of authority and oppression which must be challenged, therefore no fixed doctrine can apply. In your opinion, what specific realization of anarchism is appropriate in this epoch?</B>

<P>I tend to agree that anarchism is formless and utopian,
though hardly more so than the inane doctrines of neoliberalism,
Marxism-Leninism, and other ideologies that have appealed to the
powerful and their intellectual servants over the years, for
reasons that are all too easy to explain. The reason for the
general formlessness and intellectual vacuity (often disguised in
big words, but that is again in the self-interest of
intellectuals) is that we do not understand very much about
complex systems, such as human societies; and have only
intuitions of limited validity as to the ways they should be
reshaped and constructed.

<P>Anarchism, in my view, is an expression of the idea that the
burden of proof is always on those who argue that authority and
domination are necessary. They have to demonstrate, with
powerful argument, that that conclusion is correct. If they
cannot, then the institutions they defend should be considered
illegitimate. How one should react to illegitimate authority
depends on circumstances and conditions: there are no formulas.

<P>In the present period, the issues arise across the board, as they
commonly do: from personal relations in the family and elsewhere,
to the international political/economic order. And anarchist
ideas -- challenging authority and insisting that it justify
itself -- are appropriate at all levels.

<P><B>3. What sort of conception of human nature is anarchism predicated on? Would people have less incentive to work in an egalitarian society? Would an absence of government allow the strong to dominate the weak? Would democratic decision-making result in excessive conflict, indecision and "mob rule"?</B>

<P>As I understand the term "anarchism," it is based on the hope
(in our state of ignorance, we cannot go beyond that) that core
elements of human nature include sentiments of solidarity, mutual
support, sympathy, concern for others, and so on.

<P>Would people work less in an egalitarian society? Yes, insofar
as they are driven to work by the need for survival; or by
material reward, a kind of pathology, I believe, like the kind of
pathology that leads some to take pleasure from torturing others.
Those who find reasonable the classical liberal doctrine that the
impulse to engage in creative work is at the core of human nature
-- something we see constantly, I think, from children to the
elderly, when circumstances allow -- will be very suspicious of
these doctrines, which are highly serviceable to power and
authority, but seem to have no other merits.

<P>Would an absence of government allow the strong to dominate the
weak? We don't know. If so, then forms of social organization
would have to be constructed -- there are many possibilities --
to overcome this crime.

<P>What would be the consequences of democratic decision-making?
The answers are unknown. We would have to learn by trial. Let's
try it and find out.

<P><B>4. Anarchism is sometimes called libertarian socialism -- How does it differ from other ideologies that are often associated with socialism, such as Leninism?</B>

<P>Leninist doctrine holds that a vanguard Party should assume
state power and drive the population to economic development,
and, by some miracle that is unexplained, to freedom and justice.
It is an ideology that naturally appeals greatly to the radical
intelligentsia, to whom it affords a justification for their role
as state managers. I can't see any reason -- either in logic or
history -- to take it seriously. Libertarian socialism
(including a substantial mainstream of Marxism) dismissed all of
this with contempt, quite rightly.

<P><B>5. Many "anarcho-capitalists" claim that anarchism means the freedom to do what you want with your property and engage in free contract with others. Is capitalism in any way compatible with anarchism as you see it?</B>

<P>Anarcho-capitalism, in my opinion, is a doctrinal system
which, if ever implemented, would lead to forms of tyranny and
oppression that have few counterparts in human history. There
isn't the slightest possibility that its (in my view, horrendous)
ideas would be implemented, because they would quickly destroy
any society that made this colossal error. The idea of "free
contract" between the potentate and his starving subject is a
sick joke, perhaps worth some moments in an academic seminar
exploring the consequences of (in my view, absurd) ideas, but
nowhere else.

<P>I should add, however, that I find myself in substantial
agreement with people who consider themselves anarcho-capitalists
on a whole range of issues; and for some years, was able to write
only in their journals. And I also admire their commitment to
rationality -- which is rare -- though I do not think they see
the consequences of the doctrines they espouse, or their profound
moral failings.

<P><B>6. How do anarchist principles apply to education? Are grades, requirements and exams good things? What sort of environment is most conducive to free thought and intellectual development?</B>

<P>My feeling, based in part on personal experience in this
case, is that a decent education should seek to provide a thread
along which a person will travel in his or her own way; good
teaching is more a matter of providing water for a plant, to
enable it to grow under its own powers, than of filling a vessel
with water (highly unoriginal thoughts I should add, paraphrased
from writings of the Enlightenment and classical liberalism).
These are general principles, which I think are generally valid.
How they apply in particular circumstances has to be evaluated
case by case, with due humility, and recognition of how little we
really understand.

<P><B>7. Depict, if you can, how an ideal anarchist society would function day-to-day. What sorts of economic and political institutions would exist, and how would they function? Would we have money? Would we shop in stores? Would we own our own homes? Would we have laws? How would we prevent crime?</B>

<P>I wouldn't dream of trying to do this. These are matters
about which we have to learn, by struggle and experiment.

<P><B>8. What are the prospects for realizing anarchism in our society? What steps should we take?</B>

<P>Prospects for freedom and justice are limitless. The steps
we should take depend on what we are trying to achieve. There
are, and can be, no general answers. The questions are wrongly
put. I am reminded of a nice slogan of the rural workers'
movement in Brazil (from which I have just returned): they say
that they must expand the floor of the cage, until the point when
they can break the bars. At times, that even requires defense of
the cage against even worse predators outside: defense of
illegitimate state power against predatory private tyranny in the
United States today, for example, a point that should be obvious
to any person committed to justice and freedom -- anyone, for
example, who thinks that children should have food to eat -- but
that seems difficult for many people who regard themselves as
libertarians and anarchists to comprehend. That is one of the
self-destructive and irrational impulses of decent people who
consider themselves to be on the left, in my opinion, separating
them in practice from the lives and legitimate aspirations of
suffering people.

<P>So it seems to me. I'm happy to discuss the point, and listen to
counter-argument, but only in a context that allows us to go
beyond shouting of slogans -- which, I'm afraid, excludes a good
deal of what passes for debate on the left, more's the pity.

<P><I>Noam</I>

<P><HR>

<P><I>In another letter, Chomsky offered this expansion on his thoughts
regarding a future society:</I> 

<P>About a future society, I...may be repeating, but it's something I've
been concerned with every since I was a kid. I recall, about 1940, reading
Diego Abad de Santillan's interesting book <CITE>After the
Revolution,</CITE> criticizing his anarchist comrades and sketching in some
detail how an anarchosyndicalist Spain would work (these are >50 year old
memories, so don't take it too literally). My feeling then was that it
looked good, but do we understand enough to answer questions about a society
in such detail? Over the years, naturally I've learned more, but it has only
deepened my skepticism about whether we understand enough. In recent years,
I've discussed this a good deal with Mike Albert, who has been encouraging
me to spell out in detail how I think society should work, or at least react
to his "participatory democracy" conception. I've backed off, in both cases,
for the same reasons. It seems to me that answers to most such questions
have to be learned by experiment. Take markets (to the extent that they
could function in any viable society -- limited, if the historical record is
any guide, not to speak of logic). I understand well enough what's wrong
with them, but that's not sufficient to demonstrate that a system that
eliminates market operations is preferable; simply a point of logic, and I
don't think we know the answer. Same with everything else.

<P>Recorded live at MIT, Class War: The Attack on Working People marks the third volume in the series of lectures bringing Noam Chomsky's words and vision to CD.

<P>Corporations and their political allies wage an unrelenting class war against working people. Privatization, the market and level playing fields are the mantras of the day. CEOs tell workers to tighten their belts while their own wallets are bulging. Income inequality is more acute in the US than in any other industrialized country, even surpassing Britain. Glamorous Manhattan has disparities in wealth that exceed Guatemala. People are working longer hours, producing more and earning less. Wages have been stagnant or declining for more than twenty years. The ranks of the poor have mushroomed. Meanwhile profits are at unprecedented levels.

<P>'Class War' is vintage Chomsky. His astute analyses provides excellent tools for self-defense. His commitment, involvement and accessibility are exemplary. It's no wonder that the New Statesman calls him "The conscience of the American people." Class War is essential listening for everyone interested in building a true democracy. Includes a question and answer session based on the Oklahoma Bombing.

<P>In the lecture captured on this compact disc, Chomsky breaks new ground by presenting his evaluation of the "Prospects for Democracy" in the world today. Beginning with a broad review of democratic theory and political history, he argues that classical democrats such as Thomas Jefferson would be shocked at the current disrepair of American democracy. The enormous growth of corporate capitalism has already devastated democratic culture and government by concentrating power in the hands of the wealthy. And the future looks no brighter.

<P>In spite of this dark assessment, Chomsky maintains that any hope for democracy rests ultimately with you and me -- on whether we can shake off our political malaise and build a democratic future. The fate of democracy is not yet fixed, he says, but "unless people here
and in other rich societies can recapture and revitalize" our lost traditions of liberty and democracy, "the prospects for democracy are indeed dim."

<P>Professor Chomsky has chronicled the often bloody consequences of government/corporate control through numerous books and lectures. His work has given us hope and vision to work for true democracy and freedom.

<P>In 1992, Bill Clinton was elected President of the United States. After 12 years of a Republican White House, voters hungry for "change" believed Clinton when he promised a new vision, a new activism, and a new direction for the US. In The Clinton Vision, Noam Chomsky speaks about the President's actions on NAFTA, health care, crime, labor relations, foreign policy and the economy.

<P>Noam Chomsky is a tireless and principled spokesperson for the progressive movement, as well as a linguist who has revolutionized the study of language. One of the world's leading intellectuals and political critics, and author of over 30 books on contemporary issues, Chomsky lectures to standing-room-only audiences around the globe. This is his first speech to be released on compact disc.
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>"Chomsky has been unrelenting in his attacks on the American heirarchy... [He] is up there with Thoreau and Emerson in the literature of rebellion.
<P ALIGN=right>- <CITE>Rolling Stone</CITE>

<P>"If the job of a rebel is to tear down the old and prepare for the new, then this is Noam Chomsky, a 'rebel without a pause,' the 'Elvis of academia....' As rock 'n roll in the '90s continues to be gagged, it is ironic that a man of 65 years turns out to be the real rebel spirit."
<P ALIGN=right>- <CITE>Bono of U2</CITE>

<P>"How adroitly [Chomsky] cuts through the crap and actually says something."

<P>There is also a different approach to the [unification] problem, which is highly influential though it seems to me not only foreign to the sciences but also close to senseless. This approach divorces the cognitive sciences from a biological setting, and seeks tests to determine whether some object "manifests intelligence" ("plays chess," "understands Chinese," or whatever). The approach relies on the "Turing Test," devised by mathematician Alan Turing, who did much of the fundamental work on the modem theory of computation. In a famous paper of 1950, he proposed a way of evaluating the performance of a computer -- basically, by determining whether observers will be able to distinguish it from the performance of people. If they cannot, the device passes the test. There is no fixed Turing test; rather, a battery of devices constructed on this model. The details need not concern us.

<P>Adopting this approach, suppose we are interested in deciding whether a programmed computer can play chess or understand Chinese. We construct a variant of the Turing test, and see whether a jury can be fooled into thinking that a human is carrying out the observed performance. If so, we will have "empirically established" that the computer can play chess, understand Chinese, think, etc., according to proponents of this version of artificial intelligence, while their critics deny that this result would establish the conclusion.

<P>There is a great deal of often heated debate about these matters in the literature of the cognitive sciences, artificial intelligence, and philosophy of mind, but it is hard to see that any serious question has been posed. The question of whether a computer is playing chess, or doing long division, or translating Chinese, is like the question of whether robots can murder or airplanes can fly -- or people; after all, the "flight" of the Olympic long jump champion is only an order of magnitude short of that of the chicken champion (so I'm told). These are questions of decision, not fact; decision as to whether to adopt a certain metaphoric extension of common usage.

<P>There is no answer to the question whether airplanes really fly (though perhaps not space shuttles). Fooling people into mistaking a submarine for a whale doesn't show that submarines really swim; nor does it fail to establish the fact. There is no fact, no meaningful question to be answered, as all agree, in this case. The same is true of computer programs, as Turing took pains to make clear in the 1950 paper that is regularly invoked in these discussions. Here he pointed out that the question whether machines think "may be too meaningless to deserve discussion," being a question of decision, not fact, though he speculated that in 50 years, usage may have "altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted" -- as in the case of airplanes flying (in English, at least), but not submarines swimming. Such alteration of usage amounts to the replacement of one lexical item by another one with somewhat different properties. There is no empirical question as to whether this is the right or wrong decision.

<P>In this regard, there has been serious regression since the first cognitive revolution, in my opinion. Superficially, reliance on the Turing test is reminiscent of the Cartesian approach to the existence of other minds. But the comparison is misleading. The Cartesian experiments were something like a litmus test for acidity: they sought to determine whether an object has a certain property, in this case, possession of mind, one aspect of the world. But that is not true of the artificial intelligence debate.

<P>Another superficial similarity is the interest in simulation of behavior, again only apparent, I think. As I mentioned earlier, the first cognitive revolution was stimulated by the achievements of automata, much as today, and complex devices were constructed to simulate real objects and their functioning: the digestion of a duck, a flying bird, and so on. But the purpose was not to determine whether machines can digest or fly. Jacques de Vaucanson, the great artificer of the period, was concerned to understand the animate systems he was modeling; he constructed mechanical devices in order to formulate and validate theories of his animate models, not to satisfy some performance criterion.

<H3>The Externalist Orthodoxy</H3>

<P>This brings us to the second aspect of the topic of language and nature: How does the use of language relate to the world?

<P>The prevailing picture, established in the modern period particularly by Gottlob Frege, is based on three principles: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I. There is a common store of thoughts.<BR>
II. There is a common language that expresses these thoughts.<BR>
III. The language is a set of well-formed expressions, and its semantics is based on a relation between parts of these expressions and things in the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This is the "representational" thesis I mentioned earlier, and is also accepted by "externalist" critics of the Fregean model.

<P>Frege used the German word "Bedeutung" for the purported relation between expressions and things, but in an invented technical sense, because German lacks the relevant notion. English translations use such terms as "reference" or "denotation," also in a technical sense, for the same reason; the notion does not exist in English, or, it seems, any human language. There are somewhat similar notions: "talk about," "ask for," "refer to," etc. But when we look at all closely at these, we find that they have properties that make them quite unsuited for the representational model. There is nothing wrong with introduction of technical terms for theoretical inquiry. On the contrary, there is no alternative; beyond the most elementary level, rational inquiry departs from the resources of common sense and ordinary language. What we ask about a theoretical framework is something different: Is it the right one, for the purposes at hand?

<P>The Fregean picture is intelligible, perhaps correct, for the inquiry that primarily concerned Frege himself: exploring the nature of mathematics. As for natural language, Frege considered it too "imperfect" to merit much attention. 

<P>[. . .]

<P>The picture also seems plausible in a normative sense for scientific inquiry, a rather special human endeavor. Both the history of science and introspection suggest that the scientist may be aiming intuitively at something like the Fregean picture: shared symbolic systems with terms that pick out what we hope are real things in the world: quarks, molecules, ants, human languages and their elements, etc.

<P>But the picture makes no sense at all with regard to human languages -- a biological entity, to be investigated by the methods of the sciences, without arbitrary stipulations drawn from some other concern. The notion "common store of thoughts" has no empirical status, and is unlikely to gain one even if the science of the future discovers a reason, unknown today, to postulate entities that resemble "what we think (believe, fear, hope, expect, want, etc.)." Principle I seems groundless at best, senseless at worst.

<P>As for II, the notion "common language" has no place in efforts to understand the phenomena of language and to explain them. Two people may talk alike, as they may look alike or live near one another. But it makes no more sense to postulate a "common language" that they share than a common shape or a common area. As in the case of "physical" or "real," the problem is not vagueness or unclarity: there is nothing to clarify; the world does not have shapes and areas, or shared languages. Nor are the terms devoid of meaning; they are just fine for ordinary usage. It makes sense for me to tell you that I live near Boston and far from Sydney, or to tell a Martian that I live near both but far from the moon. The same holds for looking alike, and speaking alike. I do or do not speak like people in Sydney, depending on the circumstances of the discourse. Some such circumstances -- pretty complicated ones -- pick out what we sometimes call "places" and "languages." From some points of view, the greater Boston area is a place; from others not. Chinese is a "language" and Romance not, as a result of such matters as colors on maps and stability of empires. But Chinese is no more an element of the world than the area around Boston; arguably much less so, because the conditions of individuation are so vastly more intricate and interest-related.

<P>For much of my life, I've been closely involved with pacifist groups in direct action and resistance, and educational and organizing projects. We've spent days in jail together, and it is a freakish accident that they did not extend to many years, as we realistically expected 30 years ago (an interesting tale, but a different one). That creates bonds of loyalty and friendship, but also brings out some disagreements. So, my Quaker friends and colleagues in disrupting illegitimate authority adopt the slogan: "Speak truth to power." I strongly disagree. The audience is entirely wrong, and the effort hardly more than a form of self-indulgence. It is a waste of time and a pointless pursuit to speak truth to Henry Kissinger, or the CEO of General Motors, or others who exercise power in coercive institutions -- truths that they already know well enough, for the most part.

<P>Again, a qualification is in order. Insofar as such people dissociate themselves from their institutional setting and become human beings, moral agents, then they join everyone else. But in their institutional roles, as people who wield power, they are hardly worth addressing, any more than the worst tyrants and criminals, who are also human beings, however terrible their actions.

<P>To speak truth to power is not a particularly honorable vocation. One should seek out an audience that matters -- and furthermore (another important qualification), it should not be seen as an audience, but as a community of common concern in which one hopes to participate constructively. We should not be speaking <I>/to,</I> but <I>with.</I> That is second nature to any good teacher, and should be to any writer and intellectual as well.

<P>Perhaps this is enough to suggest that even the question of choice of audience is not entirely trivial.

<H2><A HREF="#contents">Goals and Visions</A></H2>
</CENTER>


<P>In referring to goals and visions, I have in mind a practical rather than a very principled distinction. As is usual in human affairs, it is the practical perspective that matters most. Such theoretical understanding as we have is far too thin to carry much weight.

<P>By visions, I mean the conception of a future society that animates what we actually do, a society in which a decent human being might want to live. By goals, I mean the choices and tasks that are within reach, that we will pursue one way or another guided by a vision that may be distant and hazy.

<P>An animating vision must rest on some conception of human nature, of what's good for people, of their needs and rights, of the aspects of their nature that should be nurtured, encouraged and permitted to flourish for their benefit and that of others. The concept of human nature that underlies our visions is usually tacit and inchoate, but it is always there, perhaps implicitly, whether one chooses to leave things as they are and cultivate one's own garden, or to work for small changes, or for revolutionary ones.

<P>This much, at least, is true of people who regard themselves as moral agents, not monsters -- who care about the effects of what they do or fail to do.

<P>On all such matters, our knowledge and understanding are shallow; as in virtually every area of human life, we proceed on the basis of intuition and experience, hopes and fears. Goals involve hard choices with very serious human consequences. We adopt them on the basis of imperfect evidence and limited understanding, and though our visions can and should be a guide, they are at best a very partial one. They are not clear, nor are they stable, at least for people who care about the consequences of their acts. Sensible people will look forward to a clearer articulation of their animating visions and to the critical evaluation of them in the light of reason and experience. So far, the substance is pretty meager, and there are no signs of any change in that state of affairs. Slogans are easy, but not very helpful when real choices have to be made.


<H3>Goals versus Visions</H3>

Goals and visions can appear to be in conflict, and often are. There's no contradiction in that, as I think we all know from ordinary experience. Let me take my own case, to illustrate what I have in mind.

<P>My personal visions are fairly traditional anarchist ones, with origins in the Enlightenment and classical liberalism. Before proceeding, I have to clarify what I mean by that. I do not mean the version of classical liberalism that has been reconstructed for ideological purposes, but the original, before it was broken on the rocks of rising industrial capitalism, as Rudolf Rocker put it in his work on anarchosyndicalism 60 years ago -- rather accurately, I think.

<P>As state capitalism developed into the modern era, economic, political and ideological systems have increasingly been taken over by vast institutions of private tyranny that are about as close to the totalitarian ideal as any that humans have so far constructed. "Within the corporation," political economist Robert Brady wrote half a century ago, "all policies emanate from the control above. In the union of this power to determine policy with the execution thereof, all authority necessarily proceeds from the top to the bottom and all responsibility from the bottom to the top. This is, of course, the inverse of 'democratic' control; it follows the structural conditions of dictatorial power."

<P>[. . .]

<P>When I speak of classical liberalism, I mean the ideas that were swept away, in considerable measure, by the rising tide of state capitalist autocracy. These ideas survived (or were re-invented) in various forms in the culture of resistance to new forms of oppression, serving as an animating vision for popular struggles that have considerably expanded the scope of freedom, justice, and rights. They were also taken up, adapted, and developed within libertarian left currents. According to this anarchist vision, any structure of hierarchy and authority carries a heavy burden of justification, whether it involves personal relations or a larger social order. If it cannot bear that burden -- and it sometimes can -- then it is illegitimate and should be dismantled. When honestly posed and squarely faced, that challenge can rarely be sustained. Genuine libertarians have their work cut out for them.

<P>State power and private tyranny are prime examples at the outer limits, but the issues arise pretty much across the board: in relations among parents and children, teachers and students, men and women, those now alive and future generations that will be compelled to live with the results of what we do, indeed just about everywhere. In particular, the anarchist vision, in almost every variety, has looked forward to the dismantling of state power. Personally, I share that vision, though it seems to run counter to my goals. Hence the tension to which I referred.

<P>My short-term goals are to defend and even strengthen elements of state authority which, though illegitimate in fundamental ways, are critically necessary right now to impede the dedicated efforts to "roll back" the progress that has been achieved in extending democracy and human rights. State authority is now under severe attack in the more democratic societies, but not because it conflicts with the libertarian vision. Rather the opposite: because it offers (weak) protection to some aspects of that vision.

<H2><A HREF="#contents">Democracy and Markets in the New World Order</A></H2>
</CENTER>


<P>A good place to start is in Washington, right now. The standard picture is that a "historic political realignment" took place in the congressional elections of 1994 that swept Newt Gingrich and his army into power in a landslide victory, a "triumph of conservatism" that reflects the continuing "drift to the right." With their "overwhelming popular mandate," the Gingrich army will fulfil the promises of the Contract with America. They will "get government off our backs" so that we can return to the happy days when the free market reigned and restore "family values," ridding us of "the excesses of the welfare state" and the other residues of the failed "big government" policies of New Deal liberalism and the "Great Society." By dismantling the "nanny state," they will be able to "create jobs for Americans" and win security and freedom for the "middle class." And they will take over and successfully lead the crusade to establish the American Dream of free market democracy, worldwide.

<P>That's the basic story. It has a familiar ring.

<P>Ten years before, Ronald Reagan was re-elected in the second "conservative landslide" in four years. In the first, in 1980, Reagan won a bare majority of the popular vote and 28 percent of the electorate. Exit polls showed that the vote was not "for Reagan" but "against Carter" -- who had in fact initiated the policies that the Reaganites took up and implemented, with the general support of congressional Democrats: accelerated military spending (the state sector of the economy) and cutbacks in programs that serve the vast majority. Polls in 1980 revealed that 11 percent of Reagan voters chose him because "he's a real conservative" -- whatever that term is supposed to mean.

<P>In 1984, there were great efforts to get out the vote, and they worked: it increased by 1 percent. The number of voters who supported Reagan as a "real conservative" dropped to 4 percent. A considerable majority of those who voted hoped that Reaganite legislative programs would not be enacted. Public opinion studies showed a continuation of the steady drift towards a kind of New Deal-style welfare state liberalism.

<P>Why the votes? The concerns and desires of the public are not articulated in the political system -- one reason why voting is so sharply skewed towards privileged sectors.

<P>When the interests of the privileged and powerful are the guiding commitment of both political factions, people who do not share these interests tend to stay home. William Dean Burnham, a leading specialist on electoral politics, pointed out that the class pattern of abstention "seems inseparably linked to another crucial comparative peculiarity of the American political system: the total absence of a socialist or laborite party as an organized competitor in the electoral market." That was fifteen years ago, and it has only become more pronounced as civil society has been even more effectively dismantled: unions, political organizations, and so on.

<P>In the United States, "the interests of the bottom three-fifths of society" are not represented in the political system, political commentator Thomas Edsall of the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> pointed out a decade ago, referring to the Reagan elections. There are many consequences apart from the highly skewed voting pattern. One is that half the population thinks that both parties should be disbanded. Over 80 percent regard the economic system as "inherently unfair" and the government "run for the benefit of the few and the special interests, not the people" (up from a steady 50 percent for a similarly worded question in the pre-Reagan years) -- though what people might mean by "special interests" is another question. The same proportion think that workers have too little influence -- though only 20 percent feel that way about unions and 40 percent consider them too influential, another sign of the effects of the propaganda system in inducing confusion, if not in changing attitudes.

<P>That brings us to 1994, the next in the series of "conservative landslides." Of the 38 percent of the electorate who took part, a bare majority voted Republican. "Republicans claimed about 52 percent of all votes cast for candidates in contested House seats, slightly better than a two-point improvement from 1992," when the Democrats won, the polling director of the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> reported. One out of six voters described the outcome as "an affirmation of the Republican agenda." A "more conservative Congress" was considered an issue by a rousing 12 percent of the voters. An overwhelming majority had never heard of Gingrich's Contract with America, which articulated the Republican agenda and has since been relentlessly implemented, with much fanfare about the popular will, and less said about the fact that it is the first contract in history with only one party signing, and the other scarcely knowing of its existence.

<P>When asked about the central components of the Contract, large majorities opposed almost all, notably the central one: large cuts in social spending. Over 60 percent of the population wanted to see such spending <I>increased</I> at the time of the elections. Gingrich himself was highly unpopular, even more than Clinton, whose ratings are very low; and that distaste has only persisted as the program has been implemented.

<P>There was plenty of opposition to Democrats; the election was a "vote against." But it was nuanced. Clinton-style "New Democrats" -- in effect, moderate Republicans -- lost heavily, but not those who kept to the traditional liberal agenda and tried to activate the old Democratic coalition: the majority of the population who see themselves, correctly, as effectively disenfranchised.

<P>Voting was even more heavily skewed toward the wealthy and privileged than before. Democrats were heavily preferred by those who earn less than $30,000 a year (about the median) and ran even with Republicans in the $30,000-$50,000 range. The opinion profiles of non-voters were similar on major issues to those who voted the Democratic ticket. Voters who sensed a decline in their standard of living chose Republican -- or more accurately, opposed incumbent Democrats close to two to one. Most are white males with very uncertain economic futures, just the people who would have been part of a left-populist coalition committed to equitable economic growth and political democracy, were such an option to intrude into the business-run political arena. In its absence, many are turning to religious fanaticism, cults of every imaginable kind, paramilitary organizations ("militias"), and other forms of irrationality, an ominous development, with precedents that we remember, and that now concern even the corporate executives who applaud the actions of the Gingrich army in its dedicated service to the most rich and privileged.

<P>Nevertheless, despite the propaganda onslaught of the last half century, the general population has somehow maintained social democratic attitudes. Substantial majorities believe the government should assist people in need, and favor spending for health, education, help for the poor, and protection of the environment. As I've already mentioned, they also approve of foreign aid for the needy and peacekeeping operations. But policy follows a radically different course.

<P>When the DOP [the September 1993 Declaration of Principles, the agreement between Israel and Arafat] was announced, knowledgeable observers recognized that it did not offer "even a hint of a solution to the basic problems which exist between Israel and the Palestinians," either in the short run or down the road (Israeli journalist Danny Rubinstein). Its operative meaning became still more clear after the May 1994 Cairo Agreement, which ensured that the territories administered by Arafat would remain "squarely within Israel's economic fold," as the <CITE>Wall Street journal</CITE> observed, and that the military administration would remain intact in all but name. The significance of the agreement was understood at once in Israel. Meron Benvenisti, former Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem and head of the West Bank Data Base Project, and one of the most astute observers in the Israeli mainstream for many years, commented that the Cairo Agreement, "much as it is difficult to trust one's own eyes when reading it, ...grants the Military Administration the exclusive authority in 'legislation, adjudication, policy execution,'" and "responsibility for the exercise of these powers in conformity with international law," which the US and Israel interpret as they please. "The entire intricate system of military ordinances...will retain its force, apart from 'such legislative regulatory and other powers Israel may expressly grant'" the Palestinians. Israeli judges retain "veto powers over any Palestinian legislation 'that might jeopardize major Israeli interests,'" which have "overriding power," and are interpreted as the US and Israel choose. Though subject to Israel's decisions on all matters of any significance, Palestinian authorities are granted one domain as their own: they have "exclusive responsibility for anything done or not done," meaning that they agree to take upon themselves the debilitating costs of the 28-year occupation, from which Israel profited enormously, and to assume a continuing responsibility for Israel's security. This "agreement of surrender," Benvenisti observes, puts into effect the extremist 1981 proposals of Ariel Sharon, rejected then by Egypt.

<P>After another Israel-Arafat agreement a year later, Benvenisti commented that "Arafat once again bowed his head before the infinitely stronger opponent." He reviewed the terms of the agreement, which left over half the West Bank under "absolute Israeli control" and the status of another 40 percent delayed for several years, during which time Israel can continue to use US aid to "create facts" in the routine manner. The agreement, Benvenisti notes, rescinds the provision of the DOP "that the West Bank will be considered 'one territorial unit, whose integrity will be preserved during the interim stage.'" Little will change from the occupation period, he predicts, except that "Israeli control will become less direct: instead of running affairs up front, Israeli 'liaison officers' will run them via the clerks of the Palestinian Authority." Like Britain during its day in the sun, Israel will continue to rule behind "constitutional fictions." No innovation of course; that is the traditional pattern of the European conquest of most of the world.

<P>The situation is even worse in Gaza, where the Israeli Security Services (Shabak) remain "an invisible but violent force whose shadowy presence is always felt, wielding a fateful power over Gazans' lives," <CITE>Haaretz</CITE> correspondent Amira Hass reports, adding that Israeli authorities continue to control the economy as well. Since 1991, Graham Usher elaborates, Israel has redirected Gaza's traditional fruit and vegetable production to ornamentals and flowers by various punitive measures, including reduction of arable citrus land by almost a third through confiscations. The goal is only in part to remove valuable territory from eventual Arab control. Israel also intends "to decouple Gaza's trade with other economies, the better to lock it into Israel's own." Export from these single-crop sectors is in the hands of Israeli contractors, and very low labor costs in the demoralized Gaza Strip allow Israeli entrepreneurs to maintain their European markets at substantial profit.

<P>By summer 1995, 95 percent of the population of the Gaza population was "imprisoned within the region" by Israeli force, the Israeli human rights group Tsevet 'aza reports, with the "economy strangled" and security forces controlling trade, export, and communications, often seeking to "produce harsher conditions for the Palestinians." Under these conditions, few are willing to face the hazards of investment, at least outside the industrial parks set up by Israeli manufacturers to "exploit the cheap labor of Palestinians." They report further that Israel continues to refuse to allow Palestinian investors to open small productive facilities, and that fishermen are kept to six kilometers from the coast, where there are no fish during the summer months. The limited water supplies in this very arid region are used for intensive Israeli agriculture, even artificial lakes at elegant resorts, visitors report. Meanwhile water supplies to Palestinians in Gaza have been cut in half since the Oslo Accords, UN human rights investigator Rene Felber wrote in a harshly critical report on prison conditions and water policy. He resigned shortly after, commenting that it is pointless to issue reports that go into the wastebasket.

<P>A year after the DOP, Israel's control of West Bank land reached about 75 percent, up from 65 percent when the accords were signed. Establishment and "thickening" of settlements also continued at a rapid pace, along with the construction of "bypass roads" that integrate the Jewish settlements into Israel proper, leaving Arab villages cut off from one another and from the urban centers that Israel prefers to relinquish to Palestinian administration. The highway projects are immense, with costs expected to be about $400 million, according to the Secretary-General of the governing Labor Party. The purpose is to provide settlers with what one calls "a road where I don't have to see Arabs all around me." Details are secret, but "outlines are emerging from settlers' maps," correspondent Barton Gellman reports, including the usual method of quietly putting "the force of Israeli law" behind projects "begun illegally by the settlers." Benvenisti describes the roads as "political facts that have long-term consequences" within the plan to "cut the Arab areas into boxes, making <I>laagers</I> (encircled camps) out of the West Bank," part of "a victor's peace, a diktat."

</CENTER>


<P>I've been asked to speak about the great powers and human rights. That's actually a very brief talk.

<P>There are two versions of the story. The official one is familiar: upholding human rights is our highest goal, even "the Soul of our foreign policy," as President Carter put it. And if we are at all at fault, it is in maintaining this noble standard too rigorously, to the detriment of the famous "national interest."

<P>A second version is given by the events of history and the internal record of planning. It was outlined with admirable frankness in an important state paper of 1948 (PPS 23) written by one of the architects of the New World Order of the day, the head of the State Department Policy Planning Staff, the respected statesman and scholar George Kennan. In the course of assigning each region of the world its proper role within the overarching framework of American power, he observed that the basic policy goal is to maintain the "position of disparity" that separates our enormous wealth from the poverty of others; and to achieve that goal "We should cease to talk about vague and . . . unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of the living standards, and democratization," recognizing that we must "deal in straight power concepts," not "hampered by idealistic slogans" about "altruism and world-benefaction."

</CENTER>


<P>It has repeatedly been argued here that Indonesia cannot [allow self-determination for East Timor] for fear of strengthening separatist movements or perhaps national honor, the same arguments put forth to justify Russia's hold on the Baltic countries, or its current vicious assault on Chechnya, to mention merely two examples of an infamous list. In any such cases, the issues are not trivial, and include complex questions of value and judgment about federalism and independence or centralization of state power. Each case has to be looked at on its merits; the arguments in the present case are hardly impressive. The proper role of outsiders is to try, as much as possible, to help the affected people gain the right and power to make their own decisions -- the <I>affected people,</I> not their autocratic rulers, or foreign investors, or the "principal architects of policy" in our own countries. The rule of outsiders is surely not to pre-empt that choice by firmly placing the boot on the necks of suffering people.

<P>It is also not the role of outsiders to affect a high moral stand, as when a Douglas Hurd -- of all people -- solemnly explains that the West cannot "export Western values [on human rights] to developing nations," values that the Third World has learned all about well enough, thank you. As for denunciations of others for their crimes, there are not too many people, and no institutions of power, that are in a very strong position to take such a stance.

<P>My own view, for what it is worth, is that we should look primarily at ourselves. In 1980, the US press finally did begin to give some recognition to what had happened in East Timor, after four terrible years. The <CITE>New York Times</CITE> had a powerful editorial entitled "The Shaming of Indonesia." I wrote a letter, which they would not publish though some NGOs did, suggesting that the title and thrust of the editorial should have been "the shaming of the United States" (or the shaming of the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> though I didn't suggest that, in the vain hope of passing through those august portals). We have our own crimes to consider in the case of East Timor, serious and critical ones, and we are hardly in a position to issue a blanket condemnation of Indonesia, whose people had no way to find out what was going on, and did not, with a few exceptions like George Aditjondro, who needs no lectures from us.

<P>The point generalizes, but I won't elaborate. The implications seem obvious.

<P>I'll wind up by reiterating something that should also be obvious. I have been speaking of one of the great crimes of the modern era, one in which we have had and still have a primary role. It is also one of the easier cases to resolve, in world affairs. The piece of gravel [as Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas once called East Timor] can be removed, and we could help ease the way, if we so choose.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>YEAR 501 is another awesome achievement by Noam Chomsky. It is a devastating array of information about the U.S. role in the world, placed in the long historical perspective of the 500 years that followed the voyages of Columbus. The result is a wonderful single-volume education in history and world politics.
<P ALIGN=right><I>-- Howard Zinn</I>

<P>This book portrays the world born five centuries ago: An immense supermarket where value is determined by price tags. What is the price of an intellectual? Chomsky's fierce talent proves once more that human beings are not condemned to become commodities.
<P ALIGN=right><I>-- Eduardo Galeano</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"The great work of subjugation and conquest" has changed little over the years. Analyzing Haiti, Latin America, Cuba, Indonesia, and even pockets of the Third World developing in the United States, Noam Chomsky draws parallels between the genocide of colonial times and the murder and exploitation associated with modern-day imperialism.

<P>In this highly praised and widely debated book, Noam Chomsky, America's leading dissident intellectual, offers a revelatory portrait of the American empire and the danger it poses for democracy, both at home and abroad.

<P>Chomsky details the major shift in global politics that has left the United States unchallenged as the preeminent military power even as its economic might has declined drastically in the face of competition from Germany and Japan. <CITE>Deterring Democracy</CITE> points to the potentially catastrophic consequences of this new imbalance, and reveals a world in which the United States exploits its advantage ruthlessly to enforce its national interests -- from Nicaragua to the Philippines, Panama to the Middle East. The new world order (in which the New World gives the orders) has arrived.

<P>Audacious in argument and ambitious in scope, <CITE>Deterring Democracy</CITE> is an essential guide to democratic prospects in the perilous 1990s.

<P>What role do the media play in a capitalist democracy? Based on the Massey Lectures, delivered in Canada in November 1988, <CITE>Necessary Illusions</CITE> argues that, far from performing a watchdog role, the "free press" serves the needs of those in power. With this book, Chomsky rips away the mask of propaganda that portrays the media as advocates of free speech and democracy:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In short, the major media are corporations "selling" privileged audiences to other businesses.... Media concentration is high, and increasing. Furthermore, those who occupy managerial positions in the media...belong to the same privileged elites, and might be expected to share the perceptions, aspirations, and attitudes of their associates, reflecting their own class interests as well. Journalists entering the system are unlikely to make their way unless they conform to these ideological pressures, generally by internalizing the values.... Those who fail to conform will be weeded out...
<P ALIGN=right><I>-- from the Massey Lectures</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This book applies the propaganda model Chomsky has developed with Edward Herman to media coverage of the diplomatic process in Central America and the Middle East, human rights issues, terrorism, and other topics, revealing the crucial function of the media and educated elites in limiting democracy in the United States.

<P>Rigorously documented, <CITE>Necessary Illusions</CITE> is an invaluable tool for understanding how democracy functions in the United States.

<P>Noam Chomsky is Institute Professor of Linguistics at MIT and author of many books on U.S. foreign policy, including <CITE>The Political Economy of Human Rights</CITE> (with Edward S. Herman), <CITE>The Fateful Triangle, On Power and Ideology,</CITE> and <CITE>The Culture of Terrorism.</CITE>

<P>Noam Chomsky is one of America's most popular speakers, electrifying standing-room-only audiences all over the country as he dissects US foreign policy with insights like these:

<UL>
<LI>Contrary to what virtually everyone -- left or right -- says, the United States achieved its major objectives in Indochina. Vietnam was demolished. There's no danger that successful development there will provide a model for other nations in te region.

<LI>At exactly the moment it invaded Panama...the Bush administration announced new high-technology sales to China [and] plans...to lift a ban on loans to Iraq...Compared to Bush's buddies in Baghdad and Beijing, Noriega looked like Mother Teresa.

<LI>Prospects are pretty dim for Eastern Europe. The West has a plan for it -- they want to turn large parts of it into a new, easily exploitable part of the Third Word.

<P>A fascinating state-of-the-world report from the man the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> called "arguably the most important intellectual alive." Here are a few excerpts:

<UL>
<LI>We now have an international economy and we're moving toward an international state -- "creating," to quote the business press, "a new imperial age with a de facto world government."

<LI>NAFTA is a secret document whose decisions will override those of Congress, states, localities. It's a real success in the long-term project of depriving democratic structures of any substance.

<LI>Biotechnology, genetic engineering, designing animal species, etc. is potentially vastly more important than electronics. In fact, compared to the potential of biotechnology, electronics is sort of a frill.

<LI>I don't think Somalia should be classified as an intervention. It's more of a public relations operation for the Pentagon.... They desperately need some way to prevent the Pentagon budget from declining.

<UL>
<LI>In 1970, about 90% of international capital was used for trade and long-term investment -- more or less productive things -- and 10% for speculation. By 1990, those figures had reversed.

<LI>Haiti, a starving island, is exporting food to the US -- about 35 times as much under Clinton as under Bush.

<LI>The US government spent more money per capita to get the presidential candidate it favored elected in Chile in 1964 than was spent by both candidates (Johnson and Goldwater) in the 1964 election here in the United States.

<LI>The gap between how much income is held by the richest and poorest 20% has increased dramatically over the past 30 years -- about double for rich vs. poor countries and far more for rich vs. poor people.

<LI>What the public wants is called "politically unrealistic." Translated into English, that means power and privilege are opposed to it.

<P>Interviews of Noam Chomsky by David Barsamian
</CENTER>

<P><H3>Propaganda in the US vs in the USSR</H3>
<P><I>October 24, 1986</I>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>David Barsamian:</B> C.P. Otero, who has edited a collection of your essays entitled Radical Priorities, has written in its preface, "The totalitarian system of thought control is far less effective than the democratic one, since the official doctrine parroted by the intellectuals at the service of the state is readily identifiable as pure propaganda, and this helps free the mind." In contrast, he writes, "the democratic system seeks to determine and limit the entire spectrum of thought by leaving the fundamental assumptions unexpressed. They are presupposed but not asserted."</FONT>

<P><B>Noam Chomsky:</B> That's quite accurate. I've also written about that many times. Just think about it. Take, say, a country which is at the opposite end of the spectrum from us domestically, the Soviet Union. That's a country run by the bludgeon, essentially. It's a command state: the state controls, everybody basically follows orders. It's more complicated than that, but essentially that's the way it works. There, it's very easy to determine what propaganda is: what the state produces is propaganda. That's the kind of thing that Orwell described in 1984. In a country like that, where there's a kind of Ministry of Truth, propaganda is very easily identifiable. Everybody knows what it is, and you can choose to repeat it if you like, but basically it's not really trying to control your thought very much; it's giving you the party line. It's saying, "Here's the official doctrine; as long as you don't disobey you won't get in trouble. What you think is not of great importance to anyone. If you get out of line we'll do something to you because we have force."

<P>Democratic societies can't really work like that, because the state can't control behavior by force. It can to some extent, but it's much more limited in its capacity to control by force. Therefore, it has to control what you think. And again, democratic theorists have understood this for 50 or 60 years and have been very articulate about it. If the voice of the people is heard, you'd better control what that voice says, meaning you have to control what they think. The method Otero mentions there is one of the major methods. One of the ways you control what people think is by creating the illusion that there's a debate going on, but making sure that that debate stays within very narrow margins. Namely, you have to make sure that both sides in the debate accept certain assumptions, and those assumptions turn out to be the propaganda system. As long as everyone accepts the propaganda system, then you can have a debate.

<P>The Vietnam War is a classic example. In the major media, the New York Times or CBS or whatever -- in fact, all across the spectrum except at the very far-out periphery which reaches almost no one -- in the major media which reach the overwhelming majority of the population, there was a lively debate. It was between people called "doves" and people called "hawks". The people called hawks said, "If we keep at it we can win." The people called doves said, "Even if we keep at it we probably can't win, and besides, it would probably be too costly for us, and besides maybe we're killing too many people," something like that. Both sides, the doves and the hawks, agreed on something: we have a right to carry out aggression against South Vietnam. In fact, they didn't even admit that it was taking place. They called it the "defense" of South Vietnam, using "defense" for "aggression" in the standard Orwellian manner. We were in fact attacking South Vietnam, just as much as the Russians are attacking Afghanistan. Like them, we first established a government that invited us in, and until we found one we had to overturn government after government. Finally we got one that invited us in, after we'd been there for years, attacking the countryside and the population. That's aggression. Nobody thought it was wrong, or rather, anyone who thought that was wrong was not admitted to the discussion. If you're a dove, you're in favor of aggression, if you're a hawk you're in favor of aggression. The debate between the hawks and the doves, then, is purely tactical: "Can we get away with it? Is it too bloody or too costly?" All basically irrelevant.

<P>The real point is that aggression is wrong. When the Russians invaded Czechoslovakia, they got away with it. They didn't kill many people, but it was wrong because aggression is wrong. We all understand that. But we can't allow that understanding to be expressed when it relates to the violent actions of our state, obviously. If this were a totalitarian state, the Ministry of Truth would simply have said, "It's right for us to go into Vietnam, period. Don't argue with it." People would have known that's the propaganda system talking and they could have thought what they wanted. They could have seen that we were attacking Vietnam just like we can see that the Russians are attacking Afghanistan.

<P>You couldn't permit that understanding of reality in this country; it's too dangerous. People are much more free, they can express themselves, they can do things. Therefore, it was necessary to try to control thought, to try to make it appear as if the only issue was a tactical one: can we get away with it? There's no issue of right or wrong. That worked partially, but not entirely. Among the educated part of the population it worked almost totally.

<P>There are good studies of this that show, with only the most marginal statistical error, that among the more educated parts of the population the government propaganda system was accepted unquestioningly. On the other hand, after a long period of popular spontaneous opposition, dissent and organization, the general population got out of control. As recently as 1982, according to the latest polls I've seen, over 70 percent of the population still was saying that the war was, quoting the wording of the Gallup poll, "fundamentally wrong and immoral," not "a mistake." That is, the overwhelming majority of the population is neither hawks nor doves, but opposed to aggression. On the other hand, the educated part of the population, they're in line. For them, it's just the tactical question of hawk <I>vs.</I> dove.

<P>This is, incidentally, not untypical. Propaganda very often works better for the educated than it does for the uneducated. This is true on many issues. There are a lot of reasons for this, one being that the educated receive more of the propaganda because they read more. Another thing is that they are the agents of propaganda. After all, their job is that of commissars; they're supposed to be the agents of the propaganda system so they believe it. It's very hard to say something unless you believe it. Other reasons are that, by and large, they are just part of the privileged elite so they share their interests and perceptions, whereas the general population is more marginalized. It, by and large, doesn't participate in the democratic system, which is overwhelmingly an elite game. People learn from their own lives to be skeptical, and in fact most of them are. There's a lot of skepticism and dissent and so on.

<P>Here's a case which is an interesting one because, while the technique of thought control worked very effectively, in fact to virtually 100 percent effectiveness among the educated part of the population, after many years of atrocities and massacres and hundreds of thousands of people killed and so on, it began to erode among the general population. There's even a name for that: it's called the "Vietnam Syndrome", a grave disease: people understand too much. But it's very striking, very illuminating to see how well it's worked among the educated. If you pick up a book on American history and look at the Vietnam War, there is no such event as the American attack against South Vietnam. It's as if in the Soviet Union, say, in the early part of the 21st century, nobody will have ever said there was a Russian invasion of Afghanistan. Everyone says it's a Russian defense of Afghanistan. That's not going to happen. In fact, people already talk about the Russian invasion of Afghanistan -- maybe they defend it, maybe not -- but they admit that it exists. But in the United States, where the indoctrination system is vastly more effective, the educated part of the population can't even see that it exists. We cannot see that there was an American invasion of South Vietnam. It's out of history, down Orwell's memory hole.

<P><H3>Non-Conspiracy Analysis of Propaganda System</H3>
<P><I>October 24, 1986</I>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> ... [W]ho are the mandarins, or to use Gramsci's term, the "experts in legitimation"?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> The experts in legitimation, the ones who labor to make what people in power do seem legitimate, are mainly the privileged educated elites. The journalists, the academics, the teachers, the public relations specialists, this whole category of people have a kind of an institutional task, and that is to create the system of belief which will ensure the effective engineering of consent. And again, the more sophisticated of them say that. In the academic social sciences, for example, there's quite a tradition of explaining the necessity for the engineering of democratic consent. There are very few critics of this position. Among them is a well-known social scientist named Robert Dahl who has pointed out -- as is obviously true -- that if you have a political system in which you plug in the options from a privileged position, and that's democracy, it's indistinguishable from totalitarianism. It's very rare that people point that out.

<P>In the public relations industry, which is a major industry in the United States and has been for a long time, 60 years or more, this is very well understood. In fact, that's their purpose. That's one of the reasons this is such a heavily polled society, so that business can keep its finger on the popular pulse and recognize that, if attitudes have to be changed, we'd better work on it. That's what public relations is for, very conscious, very well understood. When you get to what these guys call the institutions responsible for "the indoctrination of the young," the schools and the universities, at that point it becomes somewhat more subtle. By and large, in the schools and universities people believe they're telling the truth. The way that works, with rare exceptions, is that you cannot make it through these institiutions unless you've accepted the indoctrination. You're kind of weeded out along the way. Independent thinking is encouraged in the sciences but discouraged in these areas. If people do it they're weeded out as radical or there's something wrong with them. It doesn't have to work 100 percent, in fact, it's even better for the system if there are a few exceptions here and there. It gives the illusion of debate or freedom. But overwhelmingly, it works.

<P>In the media, it's still more obvious. The media, after all, are corporations integrated into some of the major corporations in the country. The people who own and manage them belong to the same narrow elite of owners and managwers who control the private economy and who control the state, so it's a very narrow nexus of corporate media and state managers and owners. They share the same perceptions, the same understanding, and so on. That's one major point. So, naturally, they're going to perceive issues, suppress, control and shape in the interest of the groups that they represent: ultimately the interests of private ownership of the economy -- that's where it's really based. Furthermore, the media also have a market: advertisers, not the public. People have to buy newspapers, but the newspapers are designed to get the public to buy them so that they can raise their advertising rates. The newspapers are essentially being sold to advertisers via the public. Since the corporation is selling it and its market is businesses, that's another respect in which the corporate system or the business system generally is going to be able to control the contents of the media. In other words, if by some unimaginable accident they began to get out of line, advertising would fall off, and that's a constraint.

<P>State power has the same effect. The media want to maintain their intimate relation to state power. They want to get leaks, they want to get invited to the press conferences. They want to rub shoulders with the Secretary of State, all that kind of business. To do that, you've got to play the game, and playing the game means telling their lies, serving as their disinformation apparatus. Quite apart from the fact that they're going to do it anyway out of their own interest and their own status in the society, there are these kinds of pressures that force them into it. It's a very narrow system of control, ultimately.

<P>Then comes the question of the individual journalist, you know, the young kid who decides to become an honest journalist. Well, you try. Pretty soon you are informed by your editor that you're a little off base, you're a little too emotional, you're too involved in the story, you've got to be more objective. There's a whole pile of code words for this, and what those code words mean is "Get in line, buddy, or you're out." Get in line means follow the party line. One thing that happens then is that people drop out. But those who decide to conform usually just begin to believe what they're saying. In order to progress you have to say certain things; what the copy editor wants, what the top editor is giving back to you. You can try saying it and not believing it, but that's not going to work, people just aren't that dishonest, you can't live with that, it's a very rare person who can do that. So you start saying it and pretty soon you're believing it because you're saying it, and pretty soon you're inside the system. Furthermore, there are plenty of rewards if you stay inside. For people who play the game by the rules in a rich society like this, there are ample rewards. You're well off, you're privileged, you're rich, you have prestige, you have a share of power if you want, if you like this kind of stuff you can go off and become the State Department spokesman on something or other, you're right near the center of at least privilege, sometimes power, in the richest, most powerful country in the world. You can go far, as long as you're very obedient and subservient and disciplined. So there are many factors, and people who are morwe independent are just going to drop off or be kicked out. In this case there are very few exceptions.

<P><H3>Capitalism's Short Term "Horizon"</H3>
<P><I>January 24, 1988</I>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> There's a paradox here that bewilders me. You're talking about the state managers, whose function is to preserve power and privilege. If that indeed is the case, how could they create this apparatus of extinction.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> The reason is that in a competitive system you do short-term planning only. Exactly the same is true in the business world. Let's take corporate managers, where there's no real confusion about what they're doing. They are maximizing profit and market share in the short term. In fact, if they were not to do that, they would no longer exist. Let's be concrete. Suppose that some automobile company, say General Motors, decides to devote their resources to planning for something that will be profitable ten years from now. Suppose that's where they divert their resources, they want to think in some long- term conception of market dominance. Their rivals are going to be maximizing profit and power in the short term, and they're going to take over the markets, and General Motors won't be in business. That's true for the owners and also for the managrs. The managers want to stay managers. They can fight off hostile takeover bids, they can keep from being replaced, as long as they contribute to short-term profitability. As a result, long-term considerations are rarely considered in competitive systems. Exactly the same attitudes take over when the same managers move over into the state planning system. Which is also, to an extent, a competitive system. What you find specifically is short-term maximization of gain and very little concern for the longer term. This shows up all over the place.

<P>Let's take another example, one which is more remote than nuclear destruction, say, depletion of American energy resources. Back in the 1940's and early 50's it was pretty well known where the world's energy reserves were, there haven't been many surprises. It was known that U.S. reserves would be depleted if they were extensively used, and that the major reserves in the world would remain in the Middle East. If anybody was concerned with long-term U.S. security, what they would have done would be to protect northern hemisphere reserves, the Gulf of Mexico and so on, save those and exploit Middle Eastern reserves. They did the exact opposite. They depleted American reserves, for reasons of short-term profitability. We're now in a situation where Louisiana and Texas are producing very little oil. We've got to import oil from abroad to fill holes in the ground as a strategic reserve. This was all completely predictable. It's just that basically nobody cared. They're making calculations in terms of short-term profitability. If in the long term it means that you destroy your own corporation, or you destroy the world, that's somebody else's business.
 
<P>We saw the same short-term view in the Reagan administration. It was transparent that Reaganomics was going to lead to a massive debt and a massive trade deficity, it was going to really harm the country very seriously. But they were interested in short-term gain for the privileged. The longer term would somehow take care of itself. That is absolutely typical of corporate capitalism, state capitalism, to the extent that it's competitive, and it's very typical of state managers.

<P><H3>Chomsky on Call-In Talk Radio</H3>
<P><I>KGNU call-in, December 13, 1989</I>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> It seems that, Professor Chomsky, you are merely a critic of society and you don't have a definite program or political alternative or system that you are clearly advocating. In what you write and what you say you give only the barest and vaguest solutions. You talk vaguely of a social revolution or something of this nature, but you don't say concretely what you believe in.

<P>Another point I'd like to ask you about is the Pentagon budget, which is only about 6 percent of the GNP, and military procurement is only 2 percent or 3 percent of the GNP. If you think that exists to benefit high-tech industries, it seems like it would make more sense for the government to directly fund high-tech industries if they wanted to do that. Probably the public would be even more supportive of it, like they are in Japan. Number three: I've heard you criticize and criticize and go on and on about what you dislike about the United States' political and economic system. Is there anything, anything that you have ever said, or could you say something now, about the U.S.political and economic system that you approve of, that you think is an achievement, a success? I like to hear if you can say anything positive about the politics and economics of this country.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> On the first point: You say I haven't written about what I believe is an alternative. That's just not true. I've written a lot about it. You probably haven't read it, but then it's not easily accessible. I've written quite a lot about what I think a libertarian society should look like and what it would mean to take the radical democratic ideals of the Enlightenment, for example, and translate them into a form in which they would apply to a modern industrial society. I could go on to describe it. I'll be glad to give you references, but point number one is just not true.

<P>Point number two: The figures about percentage of GNP are almost totally meaningless. The point is that the corporate managers in advanced industry -- this is true of electronics, computers, pharmaceuticals, etc. -- expect that the government, meaning the public, will pick up the costly parts of the production process, the parts that are not profitable -- research and development. That's got to be paid for by the public. Furthermore, the public, through the Pentagon, provides a state-guaranteed market, which is available for waste production if commercial markets don't work. That is a gift to the corporate managers. It's a cushion for planning. When something can be sold on the market, you sell it. If not, the public purchases it and destroys it. Furthermore, the public pays the cost while the corporation makes the profit. If you take a look at particular industries you can see how this works.

<P>Take, say, the computer industry, the core of the modern industrial economy. I'm kind of smoothing the edges here, but the story is essentially accurate. You can put in tenth-order effect, if you like. In the 1950s, computers were not marketable, so the public paid 100 percent of the cost of research, development and production through the Pentagon. By the 1960s, they were beginning to be marketable in the commercial market, so the public participation declined to about 50 percent. The idea is that the public pays the costs, the corporations make the profits. Public subsidy, private profit; that's what we call free enterprise. By the 1980s there were very substantial new expenditures required for advances in fifth-generation computers and new fancy parallel processing systems, etc. So the public's share in the costs went up very substantially through Star Wars and the Pentagon, etc. That's the way it works. Percentage of GNP doesn't tell you anything relevant to this process.

<P>As to why the government doesn't just come to the population and play it the Japanese way, the answer is, in my view, and this has been the answer that business has given and I think they're right, that the public here wouldn't tolerate it. This is not a docile, submissive population like Japan. You can't come to the population here and tell them : "Look, next year you're going to cut back on your consumption by this amount so that IBM can make more profits and then maybe ten years from now your son or your daughter will get a job." That wouldn't wash. What you tell people here is: "The Russians are coming, so we better send up a lot of missiles into space and maybe out of that will come something useful for IBM and then maybe your son will get a job in ten years." Those last parts you don't bother saying.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> Who are you quoting? Are you quoting yourself or some analyst in the military or what?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> What I'm saying is what politicians in the United States say.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> I've never heard them say that.</FONT>

<P>You've never heard a politician in the United States say, "The Russians are coming, we have to have more missiles?"

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> I never heard them say that we need it because we have to fund some high-tech industries.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> You didn't hear what I just said. I said that the last two sentences I added were not what is publicly said. How you do it in the United States is you say, look, we've got to defend ourselves, we need Star Wars, we need the Pentagon system, and the effect of that is to achieve what I just described with regard to the computer industry, or the semiconductor industry, or whatever. That is because this is a relatively free society.

<P>If politicians were to approach the public telling them, "Look, we've decided that next year you're going to cut back on your consumption so that IBM will make more profit," the reaction in the United States would be a healthy reaction: "Who are you to tell me to cut back so that IBM will make more profit? If it's going to be a social decision of that kind, I want to take part in it." And that's precisely why business does not want to be put in those terms. They do not want social policy, which is going to organize people, to become involved in making decisions over investment. This issue has come up over the years, many times, in the business press. Go back to the 1940s. It was recognized, as any economist will tell you, that you can get the same priming effect for industry, maybe even more efficient, through other forms of government intervention besides military production.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> Right. That's my point.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Sure you can do that, but it's irrelevant, and business understands exactly why it's irrelevant. You can read editorials in <CITE>Business Week</CITE> going back to the late 1940s where they point out there are two techniques: one technique is the military system, the other technique would be social spending, infrastructure development, hospitals, services, etc. or useful production. But the latter is no good. It will work from a technical, economic point of view, but it has all sorts of unwelcome side effects. For example, it tends to organize public constituencies. If the government gets involved in carrying out activities that affect the public existence directly, people will want to get involved in it.


<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Caller:</B> Professor Chomsky, it's a pleasure to ask you these questions. I'm from Canada, where your books are obtainable in virtually every bookstore. Your last book, <CITE>Necessary Illusions,</CITE> is on a paperback non-fiction bestseller list. I don't see the same availability of your thoughts in America. That's the first question: Why is that? The second question is: Do you have any comment on the elite media coverage of the situation in El Salvador regarding the [killing of] six Jesuit priests? The third question is, regarding the Middle East: A comment that I'm hearing again and again from people like Martin Peretz [of the <CITE>New Republic</CITE>] and others regarding the Palestinians is that these are Muslims, they're tribal savages, they're pre-Enlightenment and they pose a threat to Israel. Israel is a democracy. Why should we consider allowing another dagger to be pointed at Israel's existence? I'd appreciate your comments on those three questions.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> As for the availability of books, your description is correct, but that's only one part of it. For example, this book that you mentioned was based on lectures that were delivered over Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on problems of thought control in industrial societies. It would be next to impossible for anything comparable to happen in the United States on any major public outlet. The United States is different from most other societies in that respect. Most industrial societies, even ones that are very much like us, have a good deal more openness on their public media to dissident opinion. There are a lot of reasons for that.

<P>The previous caller had asked whether I had ever said anything nice about the United States. The answer is, very often. One of the things that's extremely nice about the United States is the degree of freedom that it has. It is a free society, much more so than any other, and that very freedom has led to problems. If you can't control people by force, you have to figure out other ways to control them. Corresponding to American freedom, which is unusual, are very highly sophisticated measures of ensuring that that freedom doesn't work, and one of them is the one that you're describing. A whole array of devices have been developed to ensure that dissident opinion just isn't heard, although it isn't suppressed either, given American freedoms. So what you're describing is true, and I could elaborate the way it works if you like.

<P>With regard to the second point, the coverage of the murder of the priests: The murder of the priests was considered an outrageous act here, and that particular action was covered reasonably well. It's always considered a mistake for a friendly government to commit atrocities essentially in front of television cameras. They should commit them when nobody's looking, and killing of priests, obviously by the military, is bad news. Therefore, there was some coverage of it. But the coverage will decline, and under U.S. pressure there may be a decision made. If the government of El Salvador is smart, they'll find some scapegoat, a lieutenant, and put him on trial and then put him away in some country house somewhere for the crime. But the chances that they'll go after the authorities who are responsible, say, the higher officers of the First Brigade, that's very unlikely. It's even more unlikely that the American press will point out what that means. What does it mean, for example, that the one witness had to be spirited out of the country to the United States so that she could survive? What does that tell us about the democratic society we're supporting if the one witness to the murder of six priests can't be kept in the country because she'll be murdered? Exactly what does that tell you? It's clear what it tells you, but that wasn't the lesson that was drawn from it in the editorials. So the event itself was covered, and after that the cover-up begins, and it will be continuing.

<P>On the matter of the Palestinians, I'm sure that what you heard is what many people say, and the only thing that I can respond to, apart from the false statements, is the level of racism it reflects. That reflects the assumption that there are human beings, the Jews, the Israelis, who are human beings and have rights, and then there are these strange animals, the indigenous population, who aren't human beings and who don't have rights, and what right do those animals have to threaten the human beings? That's not something that's unique in European or American history. It was attitudes like that that made it possible for those who conquered the United States, the European settlers, to basically wipe out the indigenous population, who, as George Washington once put it, were not really humans; they were just wolves who looked like men. As long as that's true, you can do anything you like to them. I think those are the attitudes that you're reflecting, the same attitudes expressed by the worst sectors of white South Africans. There's no arguing with those positions, any more than you could argue with a Nazi who told you that the Jews weren't human.

<P><H3>The "Concision" Technique of U.S. Media</H3>
<P><I>February 2, 1990</I>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> I'm interested that you've said that commercial radio is less ideological than public radio.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> That's been my experience. Here I'd want to be a little more cautious. Public radio out in the sticks, in my experience, is pretty open. So when I go to Wyoming or Iowa I'm on public radio, for longer discussions. That would be very hard to imagine in Boston or Washington. Occasionally you might get on with somebody else to balance you for three minutes, in which there are three sentences for each person. But anything that would be more in depth would be very difficult. It's worth bearing in mind that the U.S. communications system has devised a very effective structural technique to prevent dissidence. This comes out very clearly sometimes. The United States is about the only country I know where anywhere near the mainstream you've got to be extremely concise in what you say, because if you ever get access, it's two minutes between commercials. That's not true in other countries. It's not true outside of the mainstream either. You can get maybe ten or fifteen minutes, you can develop a thought. If you can get on a U.S. mainstream program, NPR, Ted Koppel, it's a couple of sentences. They're very well aware of it. Do you know Jeff Hansen?

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> He's at WORT, Madison.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Last time I was out there, he wanted to arrange an interview when I was in the area giving some talks on the media. He started by playing a tape that he had that you've probably heard where he had interviewed Jeff Greenfield, some mucky-muck with *Nightline*. He asked Greenfield, How come you never have Chomsky on? Greenfield starts with a kind of tirade about how this guy's a wacko from Neptune. After he calmed down and stopped foaming at the mouth, he then said something which was quite right: Look, he probably "lacks concision." We need the kind of people who can say something in a few brief sentences. Maybe the best expert on some topic is from Turkey and speaks only Turkish. That's no good for us. We've got to get somebody who can say something with concision, and this guy Chomsky just rants on and on. There's something to that.

<P>Take a look at the February/March 1990 <CITE>Mother Jones.</CITE> There's an interesting article by Marc Cooper in which he does an analysis of the main people who appear as experts on shows. Of course, they're all skewed to the right, and the same people appear over and over. But the commentary is interesting. He talks to media people about this and they say, These are people who know how to make their thoughts concise and simple and straightforward and they can make those brief two-sentence statements between commercials. That's quite significant. Because if you're constrained to producing two sentences between commercials, or 700 words in an op-ed piece, you can do nothing but express conventional thoughts. If you express conventional thoughts, you don't need any basis for it or any background, or any arguments. If you try to express something that's somewhat unconventional, people will rightly ask why you're saying that. They're right. If I refer to the United States invasion of South Vietnam, people will ask, "What are you talking about? I never heard of that." And they're right. They've never heard about it. So I'd have to explain what I mean.

<P>Or suppose I'm talking about international terrorism, and I say that we ought to stop it in Washington, which is a major center of it. People back off, "What do you mean, Washington's a major center of it?" Then you have to explain. You have to give some background. That's exactly what Jeff Greenfield is talking about. You don't want people who have to give background, because that would allow critical thought. What you want is completely conformist ideas. You want just repetition of the propaganda line, the party line. For that you need "concision". I could do it too. I could say what I think in three sentences, too. But it would just sound as if it was off the wall, because there's no basis laid for it. If you come from the American Enterprise Institute and you say it in three sentences, yes, people hear it every day, so what's the big deal? Yeah, sure, Qaddafi's the biggest monster in the world, and the Russians are conquering the world, and this and that, Noriega's the worst gangster since so-and-so. For that kind of thing you don't need any background. You just rehash the thoughts that everybody's always expressed and that you hear from Dan Rather and everyone else. That's a structural technique that's very valuable. In fact, if people like Ted Koppel were smarter, they would allow more dissidents on, because they would just make fools of themselves. Either you would sell out and repeat what everybody else is saying because it's the only way to sound sane, or else you would say what you think, in which case you'd sound like a madman, even if what you think is absolutely true and easily supportable. The reason is that the whole system so completely excludes it. It'll sound crazy, rightly, from their point of view. And since you have to have concision, as Jeff Greenfield says, you don't have time to explain it. That's a marvelous structural technique of propaganda. They do the same thing in Japan, I'm told. Most of the world still hasn't reached that level of sophistication. You can go on Belgian national radio or the BBC and actually say what you mean. That's very hard in the United States.

<P><H3>Alternative Media & Boston Globe "Ban" on Chomsky</H3>
<P><I>February 2, 1990</I>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B>  In a 1986 interview that we did, you were fairly negative about the possibilities of an alternative media developing.  Since then, however, we have the establishment of Z magazine, the growth of community radio, cable TV, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, I understand a Canadian film crew is doing a documentary on you, there's been a lot of developments.  Do you see that as a positive thing? Are you surprised by it?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> I don't remember what I said in that interview, but I've always felt it would be a very positive thing and it should be pushed as far as it can go. I think it's going to have a very hard time. There's such a concentration of resources and power that alternative media, while extremely important, are going to have quite a battle. It's true, there are things which are small successes, but it's because people have been willing to put in an incredible effort. Take <CITE>Z Magazine.</CITE> That's a national magazine which literally has a staff of two and no resources, none, except for what some friends give. Putting out a magazine with no resources is backbreaking labor.

<P>South End Press has sort of made it, that is, they're surviving.
It's a small collective with again no resources, and they put out a lot of books, including quite a lot of good ones. But for a South End book to get reviewed is almost impossible. Take the <CITE>Boston Globe,</CITE> for example. By the standards of American journalism it's a very liberal newspaper. Their book review editor a couple of years ago said publicly that she would never allow a South End book to be reviewed. The reason that she gave was that I was a South End author, and as long as I was a South End author she'd never allow a South End book to be reviewed. My books are not only not reviewed in the <CITE>Boston Globe,</CITE> but they won't even list them. There's a section on Sunday where they list things by local authors. Like some local author wrote a chapter in a cookbook. They won't even list my books under listings by local authors.

<P>In fact, sometimes it's kind of comical. For example, the National Council of Teachers of English every year gives out what they call an "Orwell Award" for exposure of doublespeak. It was awarded to me for <CITE>On Power and Ideology</CITE> two years ago. This year it was awarded to the book that Edward Herman and I did, <CITE>Manufacturing Consent.</CITE> Just at the time when that award was given, a <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> columnist, a rather left-liberal columnist, incidentally, wrote a column interviewing the guy who is in charge of this award. It was a very upbeat column about what a terrific idea this is to give an award for exposure of doublespeak. She listed some of the people who had gotten it in the past, Ted Koppel, etc. There was a very striking omission: This year's award was not mentioned. It happened to go to a local person, which usually is mentioned. It also happened to be the first time, I think, that anybody had gotten it for the second time. Furthermore, both of the books in question were books about the media. It's not what Ted Koppel does. It was critique of the media. None of that could be mentioned. South End has a very hard time getting a book reviewed. It's been written up in <CITE>Publisher's Weekly,</CITE> in fact, which has discussed this.

<P>If you don't have access to capital resources, advertisers, the powerful modes of public articulation, your outreach is going to be extremely limited. You can make up for it to some extent with just hard work. There are ways of compensating. Some of these ways are important. For example, dissidents in lots of societies cooperate. I spend an awful lot of time, for example, just xeroxing stuff, copying stuff for friends in other countries who are, in their countries, in roughly the situation I'm in here. They do the same for me. That means that although I don't get a research grant to work on this kind of stuff or time off or whatever, I do have access to resources that mainstream scholars or for that matter the CIA don't have. The CIA or mainstream scholars don't have a very smart and perceptive guy in Israel scanning the Hebrew journals for them picking out the things that are important, doing an interpretation and analysis of them and sending reams of this material to me.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> You're talking about Israel Shahak.</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> Yes. That is a big difference. That means I've got resources. Shahak is the main one and there are others. I've got other friends that do the same thing. I and others do the same for them. The same is true in Australia and England and other places. So there are kind of networks of cooperation developed. Here on my desk, for example, is a collection of stuff from a friend of mine who does careful monitoring of the whole press in Los Angeles and a lot of the British press, which he reads, a selection so I don't have to read the movie reviews and the gossip and the rest of it. I get the occasional nugget that sneaks through that you maybe find if you're carefully and intelligently and critically reviewing a wide range of press. There are a fair number of people that do this, and we exchange information. The end result is that you do have access to resources in a way I doubt that any national intelligence agency can duplicate.

<P>So there are ways of compensating for the absence of resources. People can do things. This happens all over. A couple of years ago I gave a talk in Manhattan, Kansas, and they asked me to meet beforehand with the local Central America solidarity group, so I thought, OK, four people will be in someone's living room. To my surprise it wasn't four people in a living room but a couple of hundred people in a church. It was a town of 30,000 or so. There was a lot of literature, including literature I'd never seen, information I'd never seen, and people who were up and back from Central America, who'd been living there doing solidarity work, dragging their congressional representatives down there. Very informed people. I'm sure they know more about Central America than you'd find at the Central America desk of an American newspaper or many Latin American departments. That's the kind of thing you can find all over the country. People have just found other ways of getting information and educating themselves and each other and figuring things out. There are ways of getting around the constraints, but it's not simple. To try to make it reach any scale that would have an impact is difficult.

<P><H3>Chomsky "versus" Dershowitz</H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> Over the years you've been subjected to a number of personal attacks. I don't want you to go into a detailed response because you have done that elsewhere. But I'm curious about your perception and understanding of the nature and character of these attacks. What motivates them? Why do they persist? I'll just give you two examples. On March 16, 1991 you spoke for KPFA and the Middle East Children's Alliance in Berkeley. This prompted a letter from seventeen UC Berkeley academics who condemned you and called you "A defender of the PLO, even when it was carrying out murder missions against Jewish children. You also have the current case of a national bestseller, Alan Dershowitz's <CITE>Chutzpah.</CITE> In various passages, he calls you an "anti-Zionist zealot, anti-Israel, anti-American, and anti-Western." Did he leave anything out?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> I didn't read it so I can't tell.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Barsamian:</B> But what about these attacks? How do you respond? How can you respond?</FONT>

<P><B>Chomsky:</B> You really can't. There's no way to respond. Slinging mud always works. Again, it's partly institutional, but in this case partly personal, too. In the case of the Berkeley professors, the letter came out about six weeks after I was there, and it was a letter, remember, to bookstores, saying that they should not allow this stuff to be heard. I've also been told, although I'm not certain, that there was an attempt to get them to withdraw my books from the stores. I think that's very understandable and I appreciate it. These are people who know perfectly well that they don't like what I say. They know that they don't have either the competence or the knowledge to respond, so the only thing to do is to shut it up, prevent it from being heard because you can't respond to it. Therefore you say I supported the PLO, etc. Most of them probably don't know what I said about anything. But the author of the letter, Robert Alter, knows perfectly well that I condemned the PLO for those atrocities, probably more harshly, certainly more knowledgeably than he did. But that doesn't matter. Facts are irrelevant.

<P>Turning to Dershowitz, there's partly the same story. Again, he knows that he can't respond to what I say. He doesn't have the knowledge or the competence to deal with the issues. Therefore, the idea is to try to shut it up by throwing as much slime as you can. There's a famous story attributed to Sam Ervin, a conservative Senator, who once said that as a young lawyer he had learned that if the law is against you, concentrate on the facts. If the facts are against you, concentrate on the law. And if both the facts and the law are against you, denounce your opposing counsel. Dershowitz is not very bright, but he understands that much. If you can't answer on the facts and if you can't answer on the principles, you better throw dirt. In his case there happens to also be a personal reason.

<P>He's been on a personal jihad for the last twenty years, ever since I exposed him for lying outright in a vicious personal attack on a leading Israeli civil libertarian. Despite pretenses, he's strongly opposed to civil liberties. Using his position as a Harvard law professor, he referred to what the Israeli courts had determined. But he was just lying flat outright. This was in the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> (April 29, 1973). I wrote a short letter refuting it (May 17). He then came back (on May 25,) accusing everybody of lying and challenging me to quote from the court records. He never believed I had them, but of course I did. I quoted the court records in response (June 5). He then tried to brazen it out again. It finally ended up with my sending the transcript of the court records to the Globe ombudsman, who didn't know what to do any more with people just taking opposite positions. I translated them for him, and suggested that he pick his own expert to check the translations. The ombudsman finally told Dershowitz they wouldn't publish any more letters of his because he had been caught flat out lying about it.

<P>Ever since then he's been trying to get even, so there's just one hysterical outburst after another. That's not surprising, either. He's basically a clown. In that case there's a personal issue overlaying the political issue, which is much more interesting. This personal stuff is not interesting. But if you look at the Anti-Defamation League or the Berkeley professors, and there are plenty of others, it's the Sam Ervin story. You know you can't deal with the material. Either you ignore it, or if you can't ignore it, then defame the speaker. That's the only way you can deal with it if you don't have the brains or the knowledge or you just know your position can't be defended. I think that's understandable, and in a sense you can appreciate it. That's just the hallmark of the commissar.

<H1>Memories</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky<BR>
<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> July/August 1995
</CENTER>


<P>The year 1995 is a season of memories, and for some, regrets and apologies as well.

<P>Visiting China in May, Japanese Prime Minister Maruyama marked the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II by expressing "sincere repentance for our past,...including aggression and colonial rule [that] caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many people in your country and other Asian nations." Two months before, <CITE>New York Times</CITE> correspondent Nicholas Kristof reported a poll showing that Japanese "believe 4 to 1 that their Government has not adequately compensated the people of countries that Japan invaded or colonized," also noting an "explicit apology for the war" by Japan's Prime Minister two years earlier. Kristof's concern, however, is Japan's <I>failure</I> to offer adequate apology "for invading other Asian countries and killing millions of people." "Why Japan Hasn't Said That Word," a headline of one of his articles reads, expressing our bewilderment over Japan's unwillingness to acknowledge guilt.

<P>The <CITE>Times</CITE> insists on balance. Thus Kristof adds that "Japan is not the only country that has difficulty saying it is sorry. American officials have toppled governments over the last half-century, and Americans do not lose much sleep over the American invasion of Canada during the War of 1812 or the incursions into Mexico in 1914 and 1916" -- the obvious cases that come to mind when we consider possible reasons to "Say That Word."

<P>Kristof reports that some Japanese intellectuals recognize that Germany is "genuinely remorseful" but explain the difference on grounds that Germany's powerful neighbors "would not let Germans forget what they had done"; China and Korea cannot exert such pressures on Japan. In contrast, few American intellectuals ask whether such factors might have something to do with the talent that so amazed de Tocqueville as he watched "the triumphal march of civilization across the desert," destroying the natives with complete "respect for the laws of humanity," "with singular felicity, tranquilly, legally, philanthropically, without shedding blood, and without violating a single great principle of morality in the eyes of the world." Or the celebration of "the Winning of the West" by the racist historian Theodore Roosevelt: "As a nation, our Indian policy is to be blamed, because of the weakness it displayed, because of its shortsightedness, and its occasional leaning to the policy of sentimental humanitarians; and we have often promised what was impossible to perform; but there has been no wilful wrong-doing."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>More generally, could 200 years of a history of crushing weaker adversaries have something to do with the fact that the very idea of "Saying That Word" is scarcely comprehensible in American culture? Or with the regular whining and wailing about how Cuba (Vietnam, Libya, or some other punching bag) is torturing us once again? Such questions occur only to "wild men in the wings," to borrow McGeorge Bundy's useful description in 1967 of those who failed to perceive the nobility of the U.S. crusade in Vietnam.

<P>Kristof's reflections appeared shortly before the 20th anniversary of the departure of U.S. forces from Vietnam. The event called forth much commentary, but no "sincere repentance for having caused unbearable suffering and sorrow" to people of Asia. The concept remains unintelligible.

<P>As the 20th anniversary approached, the government of Vietnam released new figures on casualties, generally accepted here and conforming to earlier estimates. Hanoi reported that 2 million civilians had been killed, the overwhelming majority in the south, along with 1.1 million North Vietnamese and southern resistance fighters ("Viet Cong," in the terminology of U.S. propaganda). It listed an additional 300,000 missing in action. Washington reports 225,000 killed in the army of its client regime ("South Vietnam"). The CIA estimates 600,000 Cambodians killed during the U.S. phase of what the one independent governmental inquiry (Finland) calls the "Decade of Genocide" in Cambodia: 1969 through 1978. Tens if not hundreds of thousands more were killed in Laos, mainly by U.S. attacks that were in large part unrelated to the war in Vietnam, Washington conceded.

<P>The toll of Indochinese dead during the U.S. wars is impressive even by twentieth century standards. For these dead, the U.S. bears responsibility -- just as Japan is responsible for deaths in China, and Russia for deaths in Afghanistan, whoever may have pulled the trigger, a truism understood very well by Western intellectuals when the responsibility can be laid at someone else's door.

<P>It is a tribute to the U.S. educational system that Americans estimate Vietnamese deaths at about 100,000.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></SUP></FONT> But only "wild men" will ask what the reaction would be to comparable estimates of victims in Germany or Japan, or pre-Gorbachev Russia, and what the answer tells us about ourselves.

<P>The killing in Indochina did not stop when U.S. forces withdrew. A few weeks after Kristof's article appeared, the Director of the British Mines Advisory Group wrote (in England) that "US bombs are still killing and maiming Laotians today": anti-personnel fragmentation bombs, of which "huge numbers, perhaps millions, remain active and explode when disturbed by farmers or children. Nearly 45 per cent of victims are children under 15 years," a higher percentage than in Cambodia or any other country. This is part of the residue of the 800,000 tons of bombs dropped by the U.S. airforce on Laos, "the equivalent of a bombing mission every eight minutes," most dramatically on the Plain of Jars, far from the Ho Chi Minh trail that is invoked as a pretext by apologists. In addition, there are the thousands of Vietnamese who "still die from the effects of American chemical warfare," so we learn from the Israeli press, where the veteran correspondent Amnon Kapeliouk describes what he saw in Saigon hospitals: children dying of cancer and with hideous birth deformities, aborted foetuses in glass canisters, and other "terrifying" scenes that remain well hidden. He is describing <I>South</I> Vietnam, which was targeted for chemical warfare by John F. Kennedy and his successors, and it was there -- not North Vietnam -- that he listened to the "hair-raising stories that remind me of what we heard during the trials of Eichmann and Demjanjuk" -- though in this case, the perpetrators are honored, not tried for their crimes.

<P>Complete figures should also include the victims of the post-1975 economic warfare that the U.S. waged to punish Vietnam, a campaign that peaked when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in response to murderous Khmer Rouge attacks, terminating the atrocities conducted by Pol Pot -- another outrage by the "Prussians of Asia," as the <CITE>Times</CITE> described them with fury after this atrocity.

<P>That war continues. Like Haiti in 1825 and others since, Vietnam must pay indemnities for its liberation. The U.S., of course, refused to pay a cent of what it had promised to Vietnam, claiming that North Vietnam had violated the 1973 peace accords: namely, by finally reacting to Washington's gross violations, well-advertised with pride and optimism. In contrast, Vietnam must pay. It was compelled to take on the debts incurred by the Saigon regime to support the U.S. war effort, and to accept "free market reforms," with the usual results. The industrial base has severely eroded or been taken over by foreign capital. The World Bank reports that famines have erupted affecting over a quarter of the population while malaria deaths tripled during the first four years of the "reforms" as the health system collapsed along with other social programs. The results are much as in Nicaragua, where deaths from malnutrition of children under four have increased by 35% since the country finally accepted U.S. terms in 1990, officially rejoining the Free World.

<P>The toll in Indochina also includes the 58,000 U.S. solders killed and 2000 MIAs, along with more than 5000 killed from Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand and elsewhere -- forces rampaging in South Vietnam that apparently outnumbered the North Vietnamese fighting in the outer regions of the south until 1968, so Pentagon figures indicate.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Two days before Kristof's thoughts on Japan's deficiencies appeared, the last U.S. Marines left Somalia behind a huge hail of gunfire -- a ratio of about 100 to 1, <CITE>Los Angeles Times</CITE> correspondent John Balzar reported. The U.S. command did not count Somali casualties, surely not those killed because they "just appeared to be threatening" (Balzar). Marine Lt. Gen. Anthony Zinni, who commanded the operation, informed the press that "I'm not counting bodies...I'm not interested." "CIA officials privately concede that the U.S. military may have killed from 7,000 to 10,000 Somalis" while losing 34 soldiers, the editor of <CITE>Foreign Policy</CITE>, Charles William Maynes, notes in passing. Nothing to lose any sleep over, hardly more than a footnote to the record compiled from the days when the founders were caring for "that hapless race of native Americans, which we are exterminating with such merciless and perfidious cruelty," as John Quincy Adams described the project long after his own participation had ended, including his crucial role in establishing the doctrine of Presidential war that was followed in Vietnam.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Kristof's ruminations appeared at a time of considerable soul-searching in Britain over the bombing of Dresden by the British and U.S. air forces just 50 years earlier, destroying the city and killing tens of thousands of civilians. Britain was then under serious attack, something the U.S. has not suffered since the war of 1812. Recall that "the date which will live in infamy" marks Japan's attack on military bases in two U.S. colonies, one stolen from its inhabitants by deceit and treachery, the other by the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people. Four days after Kristof's article came the 50th anniversary of the U.S. fire-bombing of Tokyo, which killed some 80,000-200,000 people, leaving over a million homeless in the ruins of the largely undefended city and removing it from the list of potential atom bomb targets because further destruction would hardly be impressive, merely piling rubble on rubble, bodies on bodies. The 300 bombers dropped oil-gel sticks and then napalm "on the tightly knit neighbourhoods of wooden houses," Stephen Herman recalls in the <CITE>Far Eastern Economic Review</CITE>, in Hong Kong. "The resulting inferno unleashed hell on earth" as people tried to escape by jumping into boiling ponds, planes "hunted down fleeing civilians to deliberately drop bombs on them," and napalmed the river to cut off an escape route. The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that "probably more persons lost their lives by fire at Tokyo in a six-hour period than at any time in the history of man." Herman quotes Richard Finn of American University, one of the American authors of Japan's postwar Constitution, who describes the bombing as "a bloody stain on the pages of American history" that stands alongside the atom bombs.

<P>The 50th anniversary was noted in the national press here, with headlines reading "Stoically, Japan Looks Back on the Flames of War" (Kristof, <CITE>NYT</CITE>) and "Japan Revising Past Role: More Aggressor, Less Victim" (T. R. Reid, <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>). The reports noted improvement in Japan's behavior. In the past, the commemoration had been "depoliticized," treated "almost like a natural disaster," but this time it "including stern reminders that it was Japanese aggression that started the war in the first place" (<CITE>WP</CITE>). The reaction here is narrow: "If that's what it took to win, that's what should have been done." There happens to be a more complex background marked by closing of the Western imperial systems to Japanese commerce and considerable outrage in the U.S. over the impertinence of the little yellow men who invoked the Monroe Doctrine as a precedent for what they were doing in Asia, but any hint of such matters is as remote as second thoughts over the techniques employed.

<P>Yet to enter approved memory is the "finale" described in the official Air Force history, a 1000-plane raid on civilian targets organized by General "Hap" Arnold to celebrate the war's end, five days after Nagasaki. According to survivors, leaflets were dropped among the bombs announcing the surrender.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>In his recently-published memoirs <CITE>In Retrospect</CITE>, Robert McNamara relates that by 1967 the "stresses and tensions" were so bad that he sometimes even had to take a sleeping pill. Fortunately for the country's health, there's not much else that might cause a reasonable person to "lose sleep" as we commemorate events of recent history.


<H3>1. In Retrospect</H3>

<P>Vietnam was not ignored during the time of memories. Quite the contrary, McNamara's memoirs quickly became a best seller and elicited a torrent of controversy. The memoirs have the ring of honesty. They contain some new information that might be of interest to military historians and students of marginalia of politics. There is little to be learned from them about the Vietnam war or policy-making.

<P>As widely reported, McNamara expresses regrets -- for what he did to Americans. He asks whether "such high costs" were justified. The costs, in toto, are the following: "we had lost over 58,000 men and women; our economy had been damaged by years of heavy and improperly financed war spending; and the political unity of our society had been shattered, not to be restored for decades." He feels that these costs were not justified by what was attained, and lists eleven "major failures" of analysis that are responsible for causing such trauma and damage.

<P>No Laotians or Cambodians seem to have suffered, but there are a few scattered sentences indicating that Vietnamese didn't make out too well. These too are illuminating. McNamara cites his well-known concern (1967) that "the picture of the world's greatest superpower killing or seriously injuring 1000 noncombatants a week, while trying to pound a tiny backward nation into submission on an issue whose merits are hotly disputed, is not a pretty one." The reason is that "It could conceivably produce a costly distortion in the American national consciousness and in the world image of the United States -- especially if the damage to North Vietnam is complete enough to be `successful'." The problem is the effects on America's national consciousness and world image. And the "tiny backward nation" is North Vietnam, which certainly suffered, though it was the <CITE>South Vietnamese</CITE> who bore the brunt of the assault that McNamara directed. The attack on North Vietnam was troubling because of the costs to the U.S., which might become severe as U.S. planes struck Russian ships in Haiphong harbor and bombed an internal Chinese rail line, and the possibility arose that the U.S. might resort to nuclear and radiological-bacteriological-chemical weapons," McNamara relates. No such problems attended the slaughter of South Vietnamese.

<P>McNamara has been praised for his candor by doves who feel vindicated by his confessions and criticized by those who object that he misinterprets a success as a defeat or who find his remorse for what he did to Americans inadequate or belated. The doves are pleased that he finally concedes that "our blundering efforts to do good" turned into a "dangerous mistake," as Anthony Lewis put the matter long after corporate America had determined that the game was not worth the candle. As the doves had by then come to recognize, although we had pursued aims that were "noble" and "motivated by the loftiest intentions," they were nevertheless "illusory" and it ended up as a "failed crusade" (Stanley Karnow). McNamara has now "paid his debt," Theodore Draper writes in the <CITE>New York Review</CITE>, finally recognizing that "The Vietnam War peculiarly demanded a hardheaded assessment of what it was worth in the national interest of the United States," just as the invasion of Afghanistan "peculiarly demanded" such an assessment in the Kremlin. Draper is outraged by the "vitriolic and protracted campaign" against McNamara by the <CITE>New York Times.</CITE> "The case against McNamara largely hinges on the premise that he did not express his doubts" about "whether American troops should continue to die" early on, but the <CITE>Times</CITE> did not either (though Draper did, he proudly reminds us). Could there be another question?

<P>Scholarship is hardly different. Thus in a critique of U.S. ideology from the liberal left, Michael Hunt describes Reaganite "neo-conservatives" as "unexpectedly obtuse," rejecting "the notion that the Vietnam commitment was a fundamental mistake" and insisting that "the United States should defend freedom around the world whatever the price." The price to whom? To the peasants massacred as we defended their freedom in the Mekong Delta and Quang Ngai province? But McNamara was better than most: "To his credit, McNamara recognized earlier than most of his colleagues that the war was not winnable," a leading historian of the Vietnam war, George Herring, observes, departing from the norm by at least mentioning that the American "failure" was "far more" of a tragedy "for Vietnam than for America."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Evidently, other questions are imaginable. We do not ask only whether the costs to the Japanese were too high when they invaded China, or whether the Nazis made an avoidable error by fighting a two-front war. However "wild" the idea, it is at least a logical possibility that the U.S. wars in Indochina were "fundamentally wrong and immoral," not "a mistake," the opinion of 70% of the U.S. population right through the Reagan-Bush years. The numbers are remarkable, not only because that is a high figure for any open question on a poll, but also because respondents must have arrived at that conclusion on their own, not from an intellectual culture that scrupulously keeps its distance from such heresy.

<P>The preferred picture of public attitudes is different. Thus senior editor William McGurn of the <CITE>Far Eastern Economic Review</CITE>, writing in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE>, harshly condemns President Clinton and others who "feel vindicated" by McNamara's defection to their side. It is this "liberal establishment" that is responsible for the "national humiliation" in Vietnam and all that we have suffered since, because they "believe the whole enterprise `immoral'" and thus abandoned the "decent America" that continues to support the war as right and just, if perhaps a mistake because of the lack of "hardheaded assessment" of the costs to us.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>The cultural gap between the general population and educated elites is a striking feature of the modern period, not only on this issue. McNamara's memoirs, expressing the perceptions of the Kennedy intellectuals, reflect the phenomenon, as does the reaction to it.


<H3>2. Turning Points</H3>

<P>McNamara was involved in two crucial decisions about Vietnam. The first was in late 1961. By then, the terror state installed by Washington to undermine the 1954 diplomatic settlement had already killed some some 70-80,000 people, according to sources that McNamara considers reliable, but could not contain the resistance it had aroused by violence and repression. Kennedy therefore stepped up the attack. McNamara directed U.S. personnel and equipment to participate directly in bombing and other military operations against South Vietnamese, also authorizing crop destruction and the use of napalm (which "really puts the fear of God into the Viet Cong," Commanding General Harkins happily remarked), and sabotage and intelligence operations against North Vietnam. Hanoi had not responded to the pleas of the southern resistance that was being decimated by U.S. terror until 1959, when it began to authorize the return of southerners who had gone to the north in the -- very naive -- expectation that the U.S. would permit the free elections and unification planned at Geneva in 1954.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>As one highly expert (and very hawkish) study explains, the goal of Kennedy's 1961 escalation was "to fight the insurgency by destroying its economic base and disrupting the social fabric of the areas where the [National Liberation] Front was strongest" (Eric Bergerud). These decisions changed U.S. involvement decisively: from support for a standard Latin America-style terror state to direct aggression against South Vietnam. The consequences for the population were dramatic, as McNamara surely knew. It is hard to imagine that he was unaware of the internal reports of 1962 on the "indiscriminate firepower" that "undoubtedly killed many innocent peasants and made many others more willing than before to cooperate with the Viet Cong." And as a dedicated number-cruncher, he surely knew that by 1962, the Kennedy-McNamara war far surpassed the French war at its peak in helicopters and aerial fire power, while as Johnson took over in November 1963, U.S. personnel in South Vietnam were at almost the level of France in all of Indochina in 1949.

<P>From 1961 to the early 1965 escalation, another 90,000 South Vietnamese had been killed (half of them not "what we call VC," President Johnson observed in internal meetings), victims of the terror of the U.S.-imposed regime and "the crushing weight of American armor, napalm, jet bombers and finally vomiting gases" (French military historian and Indochina specialist Bernard Fall).<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>McNamara knew all of this. Nothing about it appears in his memoirs -- presumably, because he considered the whole matter of no significance, imposing no measurable costs.

<P>The second crucial decision that involved McNamara was in January-February 1965: the decision to escalate radically the attack against South Vietnam. This was recognized at once by Bernard Fall to be the fundamental policy decision. As he wrote a few months later, "what changed the character of the Vietnam war was <I>not</I> the decision to bomb North Vietnam; <I>not</I> the decision to use American ground troops in South Vietnam; but the decision to wage unlimited aerial warfare inside the country at the price of literally pounding the place to bits."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>All of this too passes without a word in McNamara's memoirs, presumably for the same reason: the population of the south was considered fair game.

<P>McNamara does of course discuss the decision to bomb North Vietnam from February 1965, adding some new material that confirms what was already known. He and National Security Adviser "Mac" Bundy ("a highly disciplined mind of extraordinary quality") informed LBJ on January 27 that "The Vietnamese know just as well as we do that the Viet Cong are gaining in the countryside" in South Vietnam. Johnson's two advisers were influenced by "one of the most comprehensive and thoughtful analyses we received from Saigon during the seven years I wrestled with Vietnam," McNamara writes, a warning from Ambassador "Max" Taylor that the U.S. is "likely soon to face...installation of a hostile government which will ask us to leave while it seeks accommodation" among all Vietnamese, south and north; a similar concern entered into the decision of the Kennedy Administration to overthrow the Diem regime.

<P>McNamara fails to mention that on the same day, January 27, he authorized General Westmoreland to use American jet planes for operations in South Vietnam, the crucial step that "changed the character of the Vietnam war." Of course, U.S. bombing had been going on for a long time, for example, exactly a month earlier, when American-piloted B-26s napalmed villages north of Saigon, killing fifty peasants. But this was to be quite different.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></SUP></FONT>


<H3>3. "Encouraging News"</H3>

<P>McNamara's omission of Fall's conclusions is particularly striking because he is not only familiar with them but even cites them as part of the "encouraging" news that "persuaded many [in Washington] that the U.S. effort could not fail." His treatment of Fall's judgments, and the failure of commentators to see anything odd about it, offers such insight into the intellectual culture that it merits a close look.

<P>McNamara describes Fall (accurately) as "a renowned Indochina scholar and perceptive observer." He is the only outside expert listed among important "Personae." In his article on the crucial decision to bomb the south and two letters that McNamara also cites,<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></SUP></FONT> Fall describes the American effort as "militarily unlosable" because of its scale, comparing it to Britain in Cyprus and France in Algeria, where the imperial power could not be defeated but was forced to withdraw. The same will be true in Vietnam, he predicts.

<P>The article that McNamara cites opens with a quote from Tacitus: "They have made a desert, and have called it peace." This is the news that so encouraged the men of Camelot. Fall stresses that the U.S. is attacking <CITE>South</CITE> Vietnam; the bombing of the North was only an aside. Relying on extensive field experience, Fall regarded the Saigon army as unhappy mercenaries who are officially called "our allies" or "the friendlies," "both terms followed by a guffaw" by U.S. troops. As of September 1965, Fall writes, there is no solid evidence that any units of the North Vietnamese army (PAVN) had yet entered combat in South Vietnam, where the U.S. troop level was approaching 175,000. That was after eleven years of U.S.-run terror in South Vietnam, almost four years of U.S. bombing of South Vietnam and sabotage operations against the North, and 7 months of intensive U.S. bombing of North Vietnam. Fall is referring to the elusive PAVN 325th Division, which, he points out elsewhere, had been (maybe still was) recruited from South Vietnamese who had gone to the North after the 1954 Geneva agreements. U.S. intelligence was still reporting only suspicions that PAVN troops might be near South Vietnam or in outlying areas in July 1965.

<P>Fall describes vividly the "slaughter" that the U.S. was carrying out in South Vietnam, where "people are irrelevant" to the attackers: for example, B-52 bombing in areas of the Mekong Delta with a population density of up to 1000 people per square mile, with effects that "can be readily guessed." The "merciless bombing" mainly murders "innocent bystanders." That is the reason, Fall suggests, why so few weapons are found among "the heaps of dead." He describes the lies of the respected war correspondent Joseph Alsop, "always willing to swallow uncritically every official handout," and the truths that Alsop casually relates about such U.S. atrocities as razing of hospitals -- a "clear-cut" war crime, Fall notes, as are other atrocities he recounts from the U.S. press, such as the transport of VC prisoners "whose hands and cheeks had been pierced, and wire run through their hands, mouth, and cheeks; and then tied together," so that, as a U.S. pilot put it "them gooks sit" quietly when "<I>we</I> [Fall's emphasis] got them wrapped up like that."

<P>Fall also responds to the official charge that the VC carry out terror too, noting that U.S. intelligence agrees with every knowledgeable observer that "the VC are deliberately keeping terrorism at a low level because of its psychologically adverse effects," unlike the U.S. invaders, who have no hope of appealing to the population and therefore must rely on their limitless resources of violence and destruction. He contrasts the U.S. attack with that of the French, not "exactly models of knightly behavior" though never descending to the appalling level of U.S. savagery. He adds that the "torture and needless brutality to combatants and civilians alike...has been sidestepped" or "ignored" in the U.S., unlike France, which had, furthermore, never dared to send conscripts or increase the draft "for fear of public opposition to the war."

<P>Fall reported the "truly staggering amount of civilians [who] are getting killed or maimed" by the U.S. assault, estimating that deaths would reach 200,000 from 1956 into 1965, virtually all South Vietnamese. A valued U.S. adviser, Fall flew on combat missions, and in 1965 gave a graphic account of napalm raids on villages in a free bomb zone in the Camau peninsula in the deep south. Napalm bombs, he wrote, force villagers into the open so that they can be attacked with fragmentation bombs and then raked with cannon, killing an unknown number of peasants.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Recall that this is 1965, long before the U.S. attack reached the horrendous scale of later years, particularly after the Tet offensive.

<P>Only one of Fall's observations passed through McNamara's filters: his recognition of the enormous disparity between France's limited effort and "the determinative weight of America's growing presence in Vietnam" (McNamara's rendition). Of the rest, not a word registered. Accordingly, Fall's reports were "encouraging news." Recall that McNamara is explaining why it seemed right at the time to escalate the "slaughter" of South Vietnamese that Fall describes.

<P>In a footnote, McNamara remarks that "Growing concern about the effectiveness of U.S. military operations led Fall gradually to abandon his belief that American technology and power could not but prevail." He is referring to what Fall wrote in 1967: that "the countryside literally dies under the blows of the largest military machine ever unleashed on an area of this size" so that "Viet-Nam as a cultural and historic entity" is "threatened with extinction" under the U.S. assault -- which, he feared, <I>would</I> prevail.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Though a dedicated hawk who backed the U.S. and its client regime, Fall cared about the people and country of Vietnam, particularly South Vietnam, which was being demolished by U.S. savagery. For that reason, what he said could not -- and still cannot -- be perceived within the elite intellectual culture. The threat of extinction can therefore be nothing more than concern about effectiveness.

<P>Elsewhere McNamara does remark that "the increasing destruction and misery brought on" South Vietnam by the million tons of bombs dropped on the South between 1965 and 1967, "more than twice the tonnage dropped on the North," "troubled me greatly." He thus falls at the extreme soft-hearted end of the spectrum, joining the "sentimental humanitarians" whom Roosevelt had derided a century earlier.

<P>We can see why McNamara shared Kennedy's admiration for "the scholarly Max Taylor" with his high "intellectual caliber," as illustrated by his ruminations on the "national attribute" that "limits the development of a truly national spirit" among the South Vietnamese, perhaps "innate," though it does not affect the Viet Cong, whose remarkable morale and "ability continuously to rebuild their units" (by recruitment in South Vietnam) is "one of the mysteries of this guerrilla war," for which "we still find no plausible explanation." And by his preference for a "military dictatorship" in 1964 if we fail in "establishing some reasonably satisfactory government." And his concerns about "how the soft humanitarian West could compete with such people" as the "ruthless" Asian Communists (<I>in Asia</I>) and his satisfaction that at least "the substantial people" of the United States supported the U.S. war, whatever the objections of the riff-raff who considered it "fundamentally wrong and immoral" -- which at least shows that his contempt for democracy was not limited to the Vietnamese.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Writing in 1962, Fall also had some things to say about the first of the two fateful decisions in which McNamara was involved, words he considered important enough to repeat in 1965 along with the "encouraging news." With the escalation of 1961-2, Fall wrote, "the military `kill' becomes the primary target -- simply because the essential political target is too elusive for us, or worse, because we do not understand its importance" and therefore do not face "the Communist challenge...on its <I>real</I> terrain: that of ideas, policies and down-to-earth effective administration."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Note that Fall identifies with the U.S. invasion, while stressing a feature of the war recognized by all serious commentators, wherever they stood on the matter: the U.S. was "militarily strong, but politically weak," and therefore could not consider a peaceful political settlement but had to shift the struggle to the arena of violence. For these essential reasons, at the same time the U.S. subverted the only free election in Laos, installing a corrupt ultra-right military dictatorship, apparently supported a military coup in Cambodia to overthrow the civilian government (one of several), and undermined the parliamentary system of Indonesia by first giving extensive support to a military uprising and then turning to support of the Indonesian military when the rebellion failed, thereby establishing the conditions that led to the huge massacres of 1965-6.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></SUP></FONT> The pattern is worldwide, close to invariant, and excised from admissible history.


<H3>4. Pursuing the National Interest</H3>

<P>In brief, uncritically adopting the conventions of the political culture, McNamara had no comprehension of the major decisions that he implemented and could perceive nothing beyond questions of effectiveness. Within the given parameters, it made good sense to give close attention to the bombing of North Vietnam, carefully considering the pace of escalation and the targets, in fear of a Russian or Chinese response. But there are no relevant costs to the "merciless bombing" of South Vietnamese. One of the few interesting revelations of the <CITE>Pentagon Papers</CITE> is the comparison between the meticulous preparation for the bombing of the north and the casual undertaking of the bombing of the south at vastly greater scale at the very same time -- a comparison that passed virtually unnoticed in commentary, for the same reasons.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>It should be added that similar perceptions were shared by a good part of the peace movement, which focused its energies to the attack against North Vietnam, not the far more vicious and destructive attack on South Vietnam.

<P>In these terms, we can readily understand the entire story, for example, McNamara's pride in the electronic barrier devised to hamper infiltration in support of the southern resistance that Washington was seeking to demolish. By facilitating the "slaughter" of South Vietnamese, the barrier might provide a solution to the central problem the U.S. faced: the inability of its clients to enter the political arena. That option was excluded, U.S. government Vietnam specialist Douglas Pike explained, because the only "truly mass-based political party in South Vietnam" was the NLF, which had the support of about half the population (well beyond what George Washington could have claimed). Hence no one could "risk entering a coalition, fearing that if they did the whale [the NLF] would swallow the minnow." The only "possible exception" was the Buddhists, who were "equivalent to card-carrying Communists," Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge reported, and were also targeted for destruction by the U.S. invaders.

<P>If the South could be devastated without interference, Washington could overcome a problem that was "of overriding importance in the precariousness" of the U.S. position, as a White House memorandum of March 1965 observed: "The lack of a political base for the GVN [the Saigon government] of sufficient strength to counter Viet Cong political and psychological superiorities." "We are very weak politically and without the strong political support of the population which the NLF have," the ruling generals complained in December 1966, so that while we now have "a strong military instrument" thanks to "our Allies (the U.S., Korea, etc.)," we are "without a political instrument that can compete with the communists in the South," a problem that was never solved.

<P>As the facts pass into the elite culture, they are transmuted into the noble U.S. effort to defend South Vietnam from "an armed takeover by an outside Communist regime," in the current formulation of the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> editors, who are critical of McNamara's excessive misgivings, though they do concede that Washington conducted its mission "unwisely."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>It would be useful to compare the reaction in Brezhnev's Russia to the only Soviet action that begins to compare with the U.S. wars in Indochina: the invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, from which the USSR was seeking to withdraw by May 1980, well before U.S. or other involvement, Raymond Garthoff observes in the most extensive scholarly inquiry. It would be interesting to compare <CITE>Pravda</CITE> to the liberal press in the U.S. throughout the Vietnam war, and until today. One might also ask how the political and intellectual class would have reacted had the Vietnamese been carrying out attacks in California initiated by Soviet advisers who wanted Washington to "stay and `bleed'" in Vietnam, adopting the doctrines of Reaganite America as it sought to undermine Soviet efforts to disengage.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Washington's problem in Vietnam was always twofold: the strength of the political opposition, and the lack of "effectiveness of GVN [the client regime in Saigon] in its relation to its own people" that President Kennedy recognized, one reason for his unwillingness to commit himself to the Taylor-McNamara proposal of October 1963 for withdrawal after victory was assured. Responding to Kennedy's inquiry about this defect, Ambassador Lodge complained that "Viet-Nam is not a thoroughly strong police state...because, unlike Hitler's Germany, it is not efficient" and is thus unable to suppress the "large and well-organized underground opponent strongly and ever-freshly motivated by vigorous hatred." Our Vietnamese "appear to be more than ever anxious to be left alone," cannot be mobilized to fight Washington's war, and are even threatening to call upon the U.S. to withdraw. But if they were free to batter South Vietnam at will, the best and brightest came to realize, they might be able to inspire some support among domestic collaborators, who might even emulate Hitler, with luck.

<P>For contrast, consider the reactions of America's most decorated living veteran, David Hackworth, who fought in the Mekong Delta in 1969 with the U.S. 9th division, noted for the extreme savagery of its operations, which peaked at that time under the General called "the Delta Butcher," Hackworth relates. In 1993 he returned to the villages where he had fought to "make personal peace" with the "tough fighters" who remained alive, still living in the villages where the battles had taken place. Hackworth was welcomed with "open arms." He does not conceal the "highest esteem" he and his men felt for the South Vietnamese they were attacking and their contempt for the "corrupt and spiritless" forces that Washington had mobilized. The commander he fought is still living in "the birthplace of the revolution," though all his family were killed in the U.S. attack that "savaged" his town, killing 30,000 of its 75,000 people, 26,000 of them civilians. Nor does Hackworth hide his contempt for the U.S. leaders who "thought bombs could beat a people's hunger for independence" and their "lack of moral courage." One finds here no McNamara-style imbecilities about how "The South Vietnamese are beginning to hit the Vietcong insurgents where it hurts most... The Vietnamese armed forces are carrying the war to the Viet Cong" -- "mistaken optimism," McNamara now concludes, still unable to comprehend that "the Vietcong insurgents" were South Vietnamese.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Given the prevailing mentality, it is also easy to understand McNamara's perplexity over Hanoi's refusal to accept U.S. terms for political settlement: that they refrain from providing any support to the South Vietnamese whale so that the U.S. can pound it into submission. How could anyone reasonable person object to that?

<P>Note that the problem is <I>Hanoi's</I> puzzling refusal to accept U.S. terms. The NLF scarcely exists, indeed does not even appear in the book's index, as befits the only mass-based political force if it disobeys the orders of the Free World.

<P>McNamara naturally dismisses with contempt Hanoi's negotiating position, because it insisted that "the internal affairs of South Vietnam must be settled by the South Vietnamese people themselves <I>in accordance with</I> the program of the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation" (his emphasis). That would mean "accepting Communist control of South Vietnam," McNamara comments -- plausibly, if the assessments of the Vietnamese political scene by U.S. experts had any validity. McNamara does not, however, tell us anything about the outrageous NLF program. Its 1960 version called for a national assembly elected on the basis of universal suffrage and "a broad national democratic coalition administration" including representatives "of all strata of people, political parties, religious communities and patriotic personalities," social and educational programs, a neutral foreign policy for South Vietnam with "diplomatic relations with all countries," and "gradual" steps towards reunification of the country by peaceful means. In brief, it reiterates the terms of the 1954 Geneva settlement that the U.S. rejected as a "disaster" and at once subverted. A 1962 revision called for "a peace and neutrality zone comprising Cambodia, Laos and South Vietnam." These terms remained in force until the whale was finally demolished by U.S. violence. No such prospects could be tolerated by the invader.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>It is worth noting that the NLF was the only force in Vietnam that described the South as an independent entity. The U.S. client regime, in contrast, stated in an unamendable article of its 1967 Constitution that "Viet-Nam is a territorially indivisible, unified and independent republic," extending from the Camau peninsula to the Chinese border, with Saigon its capital. If McNamara has even a vague idea about such matters, it's not to be found here. Rather his book is full of confusions and outright absurdities about defending South Vietnam from the South Vietnamese, and so on. Thus he explains that after Geneva, "our country assumed responsibility from France for protecting Vietnam south of the 1954 partition line," a characterization of the Geneva accords that does not even merit refutation, though it's possible that McNamara believes what he is saying. The issue was a millimeter away from his assignment, so he cannot be expected to know anything about it.

<P>McNamara explains with admirable frankness what he means by the "independent, non-Communist South Vietnam" that he offered to the South Vietnamese whale after it surrendered to U.S. power -- which, under the U.S. negotiating offers, would continue to rule South Vietnam, by violence if necessary, after external support for the resistance ends. He refers virtually in the same breath to Indonesia, which had "reversed course" after the killing of "300,000 or more PKI members...and now lay in the hands of independent nationalists led by Suharto," who had orchestrated the slaughter.

<P>Note that Suharto's victims become members of the PKI (the Communist Party) by virtue of having been killed. The term does, however, have some merit in the light of the conclusion of mainstream scholarship that "the PKI had won widespread support not as a revolutionary party but as an organization defending the interests of the poor within the existing system" (Harold Crouch). If so, there must have been plenty of "Communists," and their extermination is certainly to be welcomed -- as it was, without restraint.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>The case of Indonesia is an important one. Indonesia was the biggest domino, a country of rich resources and potential, which, it was feared, might be influenced by Communist success on the mainland, a particular danger because of the domestic appeal of the party of the poor. Washington's strong support for the 1957-8 military revolt against the independent nationalist Sukarno government was motivated by fear that the PKI would win the next election, and the cancellation of all elections after the U.S. subversive activities had undermined the parliamentary system was considered a substantial victory. Washington then looked forward to the "elimination" of the PKI, which was achieved with the Suharto coup and the huge slaughter organized and instigated by the army he commanded in late 1965, an operation ranked by the CIA as among "the worst mass murders of the 20th century." This "staggering mass slaughter" as the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> described it, was backed enthusiastically by the U.S. government (if not instigated by it), and welcomed with unconcealed delight by the media and political analysts in the United States. The U.S. responded eagerly to the army's request for weapons "to arm Moslem and nationalist youth in Central Java for use against the PKI" in the context of the proclaimed policy "to eliminate the PKI." The General in charge of the slaughter was an "independent nationalist" in the sense that he subordinated himself to U.S. power and opened his country at once to foreign investors. He was a "pro-Western neutralist," in the Orwellian terminology of U.S. political discourse, though far more murderous even than the norm.

<P>That is the model of "independent nationalism" that McNamara offers to the only mass-based political party in South Vietnam, without shame or probably much comprehension,

<P>McNamara in fact knows -- or once knew -- more than he lets on here. Immediately after the gratifying mass slaughter, he took credit for the achievement, telling a Senate Committee that U.S. military aid to Indonesia had "paid dividends" and was therefore justified, and informing President Johnson, in a private communication, that U.S. military assistance to the Indonesian army had "encouraged it to move against the PKI when the opportunity was presented." He stressed particularly the value of the programs that brought Indonesian military personnel for training in American universities, where they learned the lessons they put to use so well and acquired "the favorable orientation of the new Indonesian political elite" (the army). A few years ago, McGeorge Bundy observed that it might have made sense for the U.S. to wind down its operations in Vietnam after the major domino had been secured by a gratifying mass murder that the CIA compares to the Nazis and Stalin, and McNamara expresses some sympathy with that view as well.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24">24</A></SUP></FONT>


<H3>5. "Lessons of Vietnam"</H3>

<P>McNamara's goal is to explain how such "vigorous, intelligent, well-meaning, patriotic servants of the United States" as the men of Camelot came "to get it wrong on Vietnam." We "acted according to what we thought were the principles and traditions of this nation," he writes. What they thought was correct, at least if "principles and traditions" are illustrated by historical fact, as in the clearing of the continent, the conquest of the Philippines, Wilson's Caribbean exploits, and much else. These well-meaning planners were "wrong," McNamara concludes, but it was "an error not of values and intentions but of judgments and capabilities" -- remarks that are superfluous in a cultural environment that lacks the concept of wrong-doing. The worst of the "mistakes," McNamara writes, was the failure to see the Communist movement in Vietnam as a "nationalist movement," as it appears "in hindsight": "We totally underestimated the nationalist aspect of Ho Chi Minh's movement."

<P>McNamara's regretful account of this "mistake" has been accepted with much respect. It is utter nonsense. Even from the <CITE>Pentagon Papers</CITE> that he commissioned, McNamara and those who repeat his words could have learned that in 1948 the State Department understood perfectly well that the Communists under Ho Chi Minh had "captur[ed] control of the nationalist movement" -- by implication, illegitimately. This was recognized to pose a "dilemma," because the U.S. sought "to eliminate so far as possible Communist influence in Indochina." "Question whether Ho is as much nationalist as Commie is irrelevant," Dean Acheson explained. He is an "outright Commie," and besides, "All Stalinists in colonial areas are nationalists." Internal planning documents consistently reveal that not only in Vietnam, but quite generally, the major threat to U.S. interests was understood by planners to be independent nationalism. That is unacceptable, whatever its complexion, given that the U.S. runs the world, a right and duty it has exercised since World War II, when it "assumed, out of self-interest, responsibility for the welfare of the world capitalist system" (diplomatic historian Gerald Haines, senior historian of the CIA).

<P>Washington understood from the 1940s "the unpleasant fact that Communist Ho Chi Minh is the strongest and perhaps the ablest figure in Indochina and that any suggested solution which excludes him is an expedient of uncertain outcome." Therefore it had to destroy the Vietnamese nationalist movement, first by backing the French war of reconquest, then by taking the war over itself at a far greater level of violence when France treacherously accepted a peaceful settlement. One of the more comical parts of the <CITE>Pentagon Papers</CITE> is the intelligence record after Washington decided to back France. U.S. intelligence was assigned the task of proving the required thesis: that Hanoi is a puppet of the Kremlin or Peiping (either would do). The distressing result of arduous efforts was that Indochina seemed "an anomaly," the only place in the region where "no evidence of direct link" could be found between the domestic Commies and their masters. The natural conclusion was drawn: Ho was such a loyal slave that his masters did not even have to give him orders. Once established, the conclusion could no longer be questioned by responsible intellectuals, and indeed, the <CITE>Pentagon Papers</CITE> analysts remark that with a single marginal exception, the intelligence record was devoid of the thought that Hanoi might be acting from nationalist motives, though even the most extreme fanatic could see at least that much. Or so one might have thought, not appreciating the quality of the elite culture.

<P>It is in this and only this sense that Washington failed to appreciate that it was seeking to crush the nationalist movement of Indochina.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT25" HREF="#FN25">25</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>It is pointless to run through the less serious "mistakes" that McNamara lists. In each case, we find the same traits: ignorance, rigorous subordination to the narrow confines of doctrine, and a level of moral blindness that is hard to capture in words. And again, it unfair to criticize McNamara for these qualities, because he simply draws them from his environment, as is shown clearly enough by the commentary on his book. Or on the war. It is considered quite uncontroversial, for example, to say that "Vietnam's war against the Americans from 1965" was relatively short (Keith Richburg, <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>); true enough, if South Vietnam is not part of Vietnam, and its struggle for independence was not part of Vietnam's war against the American invaders.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT26" HREF="#FN26">26</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>It is also pointless to run through the record of McNamara's thoughts about what was happening in Laos, South Asia, Cuba, or even in Washington. At each point, we simply find more evidence of the inability of a narrow technocrat to comprehend anything beyond his specific assignment -- facts that may tell us something about American political culture, but virtually nothing about the intended topic of the book.

<P>Though his record omits the crucial decisions, McNamara does not join the Camelot memoirists who radically revised their histories of the Kennedy years to conform with changing fashions after the Tet offensive, and to salvage their own reputations. Nonetheless, his account is highly selective, probably out of ignorance. Thus he gives the conventional description of JFK's distress at the murder of Diem, but (also conventionally) omits Kennedy's secret cable a few days later (Nov. 6) effusively praising Ambassador Lodge for his "fine job" and "leadership" in orchestrating the coup, an "achievement...of the greatest importance" that "is recognized here throughout the Government," which was gratified that the generals may now be able to drive to the military victory on which Kennedy insisted unwaveringly as a condition for eventual withdrawal.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT27" HREF="#FN27">27</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>McNamara does join with post-Tet revisionism in suggesting that Kennedy would not have taken Johnson's path. His reasons reveal again his remarkable irrationality. He offers two: (1) Kennedy "appeared willing, if necessary, to trade the obsolete American Jupiter missiles in Turkey for the Soviet missiles in Cuba in order to avert this risk" of nuclear war at the time of the missile crisis; and (2) he resisted pressure to engage U.S. military force directly at the Bay of Pigs.

<P>Consider (1). Vice-President Johnson was one of the few who "pushed for a speedy trade of the Jupiters," Barton Bernstein observes in a close analysis of the released record, while Kennedy preferred the advice of Soviet expert Llewellyn Thompson, whom Johnson criticized as a "warhawk," and decided not to make the trade. "We were, indeed, on the brink of nuclear disaster," McNamara now believes, as Kennedy avoided this possible way out. By McNamara's logic, it follows that LBJ was much less likely to escalate in Vietnam than Kennedy.

<P>During the Bay of Pigs affair, LBJ seems to have played little role. But Kennedy took a "relatively modest" operation and turned it into a substantial invasion, Piero Gleijeses observes in a recent study of available documents. He had backed himself into a corner by fevered campaign rhetoric about the "Communist menace" that Eisenhower and Nixon had allowed "to arise only ninety miles from the shores of the United States," denouncing them for offering "virtually no support" to the "fighters for freedom" that he later sent to disaster in Cuba. Kennedy "had no qualms about the right of the United States to overthrow Castro," Gleijesis concludes, and never even considered the criticism of the operation by Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Mann, who pointed out that it would violate international law and treaty obligations and would be opposed by a majority of Latin Americans.

<P>After the failure of his invasion, Kennedy "categorically refused the olive branch" offered by Cuba, Gleijeses continues. He chose instead to initiate terror and sabotage operations (Operation MONGOOSE), having drawn the from the Bay of Pigs failure the lesson "not that he should talk to Castro, but that he should intensify his efforts to overthrow him." These operations were conducted by the CIA under "unmitigated pressure from the President and the Attorney General" Robert Kennedy, who directed them (Samuel Halpern, Executive Assistant to William Harvey, Chief of the CIA Task Force for Mongoose before, during, and after the missile crisis). The terror continued through the missile crisis, and pressure on the CIA to extend it "was intensified even more in 1963" after the crisis ended, Halpern reports. During the crisis, sabotage operations increased under Robert Kennedy's urging: "sabotage was the administration's order of the day <I>during</I> the missile crisis" (Halpern), including at least one (possibly unplanned) operation that may have killed hundreds of Cubans and could easily have set off a nuclear war.<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT28" HREF="#FN28">28</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>The fact that McNamara is reduced to such pathetic evidence lends further support to the surmise that JFK probably would have reacted much as his successor did as the military victory he sought proved harder to attain.

<P>McNamara relates that his last official act on Vietnam was on February 27, 1968, when he "opposed Westy's renewed appeal for 200,000 additional troops on economic, political, and moral grounds." To discover what those grounds were, we have to turn elsewhere, in particular, to the final sections of the <CITE>Pentagon Papers.</CITE> They outline the concerns among planners caused by the "massive march on the Pentagon" that McNamara derides, the fear of massive civil disobedience among large parts of the population, the concern that troops would be needed here "for civil disorder control," particularly if "Westy's" request were granted, running the risk of "provoking a domestic crisis of unprecedented proportions."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT29" HREF="#FN29">29</A></SUP></FONT> The fact that Fall's fears of "extinction" were not realized can be attributed largely to such factors, as the most recent insights into the moral level of the elite culture reveal once again, a lesson worth heeding.

<P>McNamara assumes that the U.S. war was a "failure" and a "defeat," a judgment that is widely shared. But these conclusions again reflect the narrowness of his vision. That the major U.S. war aims had been achieved was clear enough 25 years ago, and was recognized by the business press not long after. As internal documents reveal, a guiding concern was that "the dramatic economic improvements realized by Communist China" would continue to "impress the nations of the region greatly" and that this "political and ideological aggressiveness" of China would be enhanced by the anticipated Communist successes in Vietnam. That could lead to a "domino effect," with the U.S. losing control of the region. It might even lead to the much-dreaded Japanese "accommodation" to China, which would establish a "New Order" of the sort that the U.S. had fought World War II in the Pacific to prevent -- though it then reconstructed very much the same "Empire toward the South" for Japan (in George Kennan's words) in the postwar period, with the region now under U.S. control.

<P>By 1970, after the post-Tet escalation of the U.S. war against the south and Laos, my personal belief was that the U.S. might well "break the will of the popular movements" throughout Indochina, so that "North Vietnam will necessarily dominate Indochina, for no other viable society will remain." That would leave a "legacy of hatred," "embittering the lives of the people of Indochina and denying them the hope of creating a decent future," even if the U.S. were to withdraw. That's not far from what happened, intensified by postwar U.S. brutality. It constitutes a great victory for the United States.

<P>The destruction of Indochina ensured that it would not provide a model that others might follow; it would not be a "virus" that might "infect others," in the terms preferred by the planners. And the establishment of brutal and murderous military dictatorships in Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and elsewhere ensured that "the rot would not spread." These too are considerable victories, enhanced by the U.S. stranglehold to prevent recovery since and U.S. support for Pol Pot, via Thailand, to ensure the more efficient "bleeding of Vietnam."<FONT SIZE=2><SUP><A NAME="TXT30" HREF="#FN30">30</A></SUP></FONT>

<P>Bernard Fall was largely right. A terrorist superpower with unlimited resources of violence, constrained only by popular forces within, may not achieve the total "extinction" of its enemies that he feared. But it is hard for it to fail to achieve its basic goals: to maintain control, undermine the prospects of independence, and not least, destroy hope. To a significant extent, those goals were achieved. The result once again illustrates the "principles and traditions of this nation" as these are understood in practice by the McNamaras, if not by others who are inspired by a different vision of what their country should be.

<P>The elections of 1994 are described as a "political earthquake," a "triumph of conservatism" that reflects the continuing "drift to the right" on the part of the American population. The victorious Gingrich army of well-trained, well-funded "conservatives" call for a Contract with America that will finally "get government off our backs" so that we can return to the happy days when the free market reigned. They will restore "family values," ridding us of "the excesses of the welfare state" and the other residues of the failed "big government" policies of New Deal liberalism and Johnson's "Great Society." By dismantling the "nanny state" they will succeed, where the Democrats have failed, to achieve the shared goal of all elite and leadership elements: to "create jobs for Americans" and win security and freedom for the "middle class." And they will take over and successfully lead the crusade to establish the American Dream of free market democracy, worldwide.

<P>One of the great achievements of contemporary ideological warfare has been to debase the terms of political discourse so thoroughly that such statements as these are not entirely false, if we keep to what has become conventional usage. As Orwell predicted, this achievement has undermined the possibility even of talking sensibly about what is happening in the world. Still, independent minds -- including any authentic conservatives who might be located in the outer reaches of the political arena or intellectual world -- can refuse to be swept up in the fashionable currents and use terms with their actual meanings to describe what is happening, and why.


<A NAME="SEC1.1"><H3>1. The Triumph of Conservatism</H3></A>

<P>Most of this, we also heard just ten years ago, when Reagan was elected by a 2-1 vote, the second "conservative landslide" in four years. In his 1980 triumph, presidential historian William Leuchtenberg observed, "Reagan, far from having won in a landslide, got little more than a bare majority of the popular vote and only 28% of the potential electorate, and exit polls showed that the vote was not "for Reagan" but "against Carter," who had in fact initiated the policies that the Reaganites took up and implemented, with the general support of congressional Democrats: accelerating military spending (meaning, in particular, the state sector of the economy) while cutting back programs that aid the vast majority. Polls in 1980 revealed that 11% of Reagan voters chose him because "he's a real conservative" -- whatever that term is supposed to mean.

<P>In 1984, despite vast attempts to get out the vote, the totals increased by 1%. The percentage who chose Reagan because he was a "real conservative" dropped to 4%, while 70% of all voters with an opinion on the matter opposed Reaganite legislative programs, and public opinion studies showed a continuation of the steady drift towards a kind of New Deal-style welfare state liberalism on the part of the general population. Their concerns and desires were not articulated in the political system, however; one reason, surely, why voting was so sharply skewed towards privileged sectors.

<P>The reasons why voting is so dramatically an elite affair in the United States are revealed by comparative studies. Analysis of thirty democracies showed "a significant correlation between high voter turnout and the presence of political parties representing clearly defined strata of society -- that is, parties strongly tied to specific income classes, religious groupings, or language groups" (political commentator Thomas Edsall, 1984). In economic policy, Edsall added, the U.S. political system fails to represent "the interests of the bottom three-fifths of society." To use a phrase that is unspeakable in polite society without shock quotes, when the "class interests" of the privileged and powerful are the guiding commitment of all political parties, people who do not share these interests tend to stay home. The class pattern of abstention "seems inseparably linked to another crucial comparative peculiarity of the American political system," political scientist William Dean Burnham observed: "the total absence of a socialist or laborite party as an organized competitor in the electoral market." That absence relates to and is fortified by the effective dismantling of civil society: unions, political organizations, and so on.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.1" HREF="#FN1.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the 1980s, the U.S. and Britain took the lead in the "triumph of conservatism," accelerating processes already underway. They therefore lead the developed world in impoverishment and degradation, inequality, homelessness, destruction of family values, hunger, and other values of contemporary "conservatism." A study by the British charitable organization Action for Children, founded in 1869 with the Queen as patron, concludes that "the gap between rich and poor is as wide today as it was in Victorian times," and in some ways worse. A million and a half families cannot afford to provide their children with "the diet fed to a similar child living in a Bethnal Green Workhouse in 1876," a "sad reflection on British society." Britain has proportionately more children living in poverty than any European country apart from Portugal and Ireland, and the proportion is rising faster than any country in Europe, though the U.S. still holds the lead.

<P>Britain has also not yet matched the achievements of the doctrinal system crafted by our highly class conscious business community, with the assistance of those whom the lively 19th century working class press called "the bought priesthood" of respectable intellectuals. The fact that there is "class conflict" and that the rich and powerful mobilize state power to serve their interests, a truism to Adam Smith, remains within popular consciousness. The 1994 Gallup Political and Economic Index gives interesting information about popular attitudes on these matters (I put aside small numbers, 3%-10%, expressing no opinion). The study reports that over four-fifths of the population think "there is a class struggle in this country" and that "too little" is being done "to level up the classes." Two-thirds "disagree strongly" with the statement "Britain is a classless society." Nine out of ten feel that the Government does "too little" for "the working class," four-fifths that it does "too much" for "the well-to-do," and over 90% that it does "too little" for "people living on small pensions/income." Half also think it does "too little" for "the middle classes." Three-fourths "think of Britain as divided into haves and have-nots," and a third describe themselves as among "the haves."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.2" HREF="#FN1.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Let's return to 1994, the next in the series of "conservative landslides," this time under the leadership of Newt Gingrich. "Republicans claimed about 52 percent of all votes cast for candidates in contested House seats, slightly better than a two-point improvement from 1992" (Richard Morin, director of polling for the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>). One out of six voters described the outcome as "an affirmation of the Republican agenda"; 60% said it "was a repudiation of the Democrats." A "more conservative Congress" was considered to be an issue by a rousing 12% of the voters. An "overwhelming majority had never heard of" the Gingrich Contract with America, articulating the Republican agenda, though a majority opposed one of its central components: "defense increases," a code-word for public subsidies to advanced industry. The chief pollster of the <CITE>Los Angeles Times</CITE> pointed out that just before the election, 61% of those polled said "that spending for domestic programs should be <I>increased</I>."

<P>All of this echoes the situation of a decade ago.

<P>The opposition to Democrats is more nuanced. Clinton-style "New Democrats" -- in effect, moderate Republicans -- "lost their seats at twice the rate of their more liberal colleagues," Ken Silverstein and Alexander Cockburn report. The "more liberal" Democrats are those who tried to activate the old Democratic coalition of working people, women, the poor: the majority of the population who see themselves, correctly, as effectively disenfranchised.

<P>To put these figures in further perspective, it must be recalled that voting was even more heavily skewed towards the wealthy and privileged than before. As compared with 1992, 7% more voters were wealthy, 7% fewer were working class, political scientist Peter Levine comments, noting also that Democrats were overwhelmingly preferred by voters who earn less than $30,000 a year and ran even with Republicans in the $30,000-$49,000 range. There was also a very large gender and color gap, white males voting mostly Republican, while women, Blacks and Hispanics voted for Democrats (overwhelmingly, in the Black-Hispanic category, where participation was low). Those with no more than high school education, along with those with postgraduate education, favored Democrats. Those who sensed a decline in their standard of living voted for Republicans by close to two to one -- mostly white males with just high school degrees "whose economic futures are highly uncertain," Thomas Edsall observes; just those who would have been part of a left-populist coalition committed to equitable economic growth and political democracy, were such an option to intrude into our business-run political system.

<P>The message, however, was just the opposite: Clinton must abandon the left-wing agenda that the voters had just overwhelmingly rejected and return to what he had promised to be in 1992: a "New Democrat." And he was quick to pick up the cues. In a satellite address to the National League of cities, "Clinton used some variation of the words `work,' `jobs' or `working families' more than 40 times as he raised `New Democrat' themes such as welfare reform, national service, lifelong job training, and the need to `attack problems that feed dependency'," the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> reported under the headline: "Clinton seen returning to `New Democrat' stance." The report didn't say when he had left that stance for some different one, on any issue of importance to rich and powerful. If he had, <CITE>Business Week</CITE> hadn't noticed. "Corporate America did fine riding in tandem with Clinton," the journal reports, though "it did equally well when they diverged."

<P>Despite all his efforts to please, still business "basically hates the Clinton Administration," <CITE>Business Week</CITE> continues, and gives him "little credit" for advancing the corporate agenda. Why? The reasons they give, and cite from polls of executives, are hard to take seriously. But there is one very good reason. Leading sectors of wealth and privilege taste blood. They think, with some reason, that they have the world's population by the throat, and are in a position to roll back the hated welfare state for the general population and everything that goes with it: health and safety standards, labor rights and human rights generally, indeed any infringement on their right to pursue "the vile maxim," as Adam Smith described the goal of the masters: "all for ourselves, and nothing for other people." Given that awareness, it makes sense to "hate" anyone who may have a somewhat flawed commitment to the sole human value: "Gain Wealth, forgetting all but Self," "the New Spirit of the Age" denounced by the lively and vigorous working class press 150 years ago, as working people fought to save human values from the rising tide of private tyranny.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.3" HREF="#FN1.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Yet another factor, scarcely noted here, has to be taken into account in evaluating the electoral results. Under the headline "Big money still garners the big vote," George Graham observed in the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> that money "spoke as loud as ever in the most expensive campaign on record." With a few notable exceptions, electoral victory tracked campaign financing closely -- again, no departure from the norm and natural in a political system in which the less affluent majority does not participate and is scarcely represented.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.4" HREF="#FN1.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Voters selected "welfare reform" as their top priority, with health care reform second and crime also ranking high. These choices, which in part reflect a grasp of reality, also have to be understood against the background of recent propaganda offensives.

<P>To begin with reality, for most of the population, conditions of life and work are grim and declining, something new in the history of industrial society. Median income declined even during the "Clinton recovery," falling to 7% below the 1989 level by late 1993, the Census Bureau reported. The decline was accompanied by -- and in no small measure caused by -- much-lauded improvements in "flexibility of labor markets." The latter is a technical term referring to elimination of job security and other such "market rigidities" that interfere with "economic health," another ideological construct. As designed for the purposes of population control, "economic health" is unrelated to the welfare of the population but crafted to measure what is valued by the rich: speculators, bond holders, investors, professionals who serve the state-corporate sector. Continuing the decline during the Reagan years, after a decade of stagnation, pay for private sector employees fell 4% from 1988 to 1994, with blue collar wages suffering most and white collar wages still below 1990 and well below 1988. Despite much misleading hype, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a continuing "shift to lower-wage industries and higher wage-occupations," executive and professional, while noting that the overwhelming majority of these are in lower-paid service industries (motel manager, and the like). That means sharply increased inequality, with the majority suffering reductions in absolute terms along with much worse work conditions.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.5" HREF="#FN1.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>But some folks are doing just fine. "The percentage of corporate income devoted to payrolls is hovering near a record low," <CITE>Fortune</CITE> magazine reported in November, having dropped sharply during the "conservative landslide" of the early 1980s, and again since 1992. With the "New Democrats" at the helm, "1993 was a bracingly upbeat year for the FORTUNE 500," the journal exulted in its April 1994 annual review of the state of the important people, who posted "dazzling" profits despite "virtually stagnant" sales growth. The ecstatic story was headed: "Hats Off! It Was a Heck of a Year" -- at least, for those who matter.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.6" HREF="#FN1.6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>While in part realistic, the expressed concerns of voters reflect the great victories of the ideological warfare that has been conducted with relentless intensity since the early 1970s in the effort to overcome the perceived "crisis of democracy." Across the political spectrum, privileged sectors were naturally appalled by the attempts of the great majority of the population to escape from the apathy and marginalization that is their proper place and to enter the political arena, forgetting that in a democracy the role of the "ignorant and meddlesome outsiders" is to be mere "spectators," not "participants," as Walter Lippmann put it in his progressive essays on democracy 70 years ago, expressing the doctrines of "Wilsonian idealism." It therefore became necessary to renew with much greater intensity the constant campaign to tame and cage that "great <I>beast</I>," as Alexander Hamilton termed the "people" with horror and indignation as he was laying the foundations for state-guided industrial democracy. The beast may not yet be tamed, but it is being caged; sometimes quite literally, sometimes in chains of dogma and deceit, an important victory.

<P>We may recall, in passing, that fear of democracy and freedom has always been one of the factors motivating the terror and sometimes outright aggression undertaken to eliminate "rotten apples" that might "spoil the barrel" and "viruses" that might "infect others," in the terminology favored by leading planners -- the main concern, of course, being independence, whatever cast it takes. That helps explain the passion of Washington's terrorist wars in Central America in recent years, or to take a current example, Washington's not-so-tacit support for its trainees and associates in the Haitian military as they did their necessary work, and the restoration of the rule of their backers among the Haitian elite under the guise of "democracy," now that the work is done and the Generals can be sent off to the life of luxury, which, they understood correctly, would be their reward for services rendered. Behind the supercilious racist rhetoric about "civilizing Aristide" and teaching him "lessons in democracy" lies a real fear: that the democratic virus in Haiti might even infect these shores. People here might realize that we have a great deal to learn about democracy from the peasants and slum-dwellers of Haiti, who constructed a vibrant civil society that offered the "great beast" a chance to take some control over their lives. Their crime brings to mind the call for freedom for all people that was sounded for the first time in Haiti two centuries ago, outraging the civilized opinion of that day.

<P>One consequence of the huge propaganda campaigns of the past several decades is the mood of "antipolitics" reported in feature stories. Concealed from public view is the fact that "politics is the shadow cast on society by big business," as John Dewey stated the truism familiar at least since Adam Smith, adding that as long as this is so, "the attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance." Reforms are of limited utility. Democracy requires that the source of the shadow be removed, not only because of its domination of the political arena, but because the very institutions of private power undermine democracy and freedom; again, an observation familar back to the Founding Fathers.

<P>But the source of the shadow has to be driven from the mind. Naturally, this is a leading theme of the literature of the ultraright foundations that are seeking to drive the educational system and media towards an even narrower fringe of the permissible spectrum. At the other extreme, Clinton campaign literature spoke movingly about workers and their firms and how government must help them; missing from the picture were bosses, profits, investors, and the like. There are "entrepreneurs," nice folk who appear now and then to help the workers and their firms. They then sink into the background along with the unmentionables, who are laboring for the common good, selflessly seeking to provide jobs and decent lives for ordinary people in the "civil society" in which all participate.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.7" HREF="#FN1.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The fanaticism of the effort to conceal the obvious has reached comic proportions. After the latest APEC summit in Jakarta in November, front-page headlines announced that "Clinton Is Stern With Indonesia On Rights but Gleeful on Trade" (<CITE>New York Times</CITE>). The "sternness on rights" consisted of a few whimpers denounced by Indonesian human rights activists and labor leaders (those still out of jail), but the Glee on Trade was real enough. It reflects the successes of "the Administration's campaign of commercial diplomacy" that "will mean jobs for Americans," <CITE>Times</CITE> political correspondent Elaine Sciolino reported with admiration. Clinton firmed up $40 billion in joint projects in his campaign for "jobs for Americans"; at least $35 billion, possibly more, was an arrangement between Exxon and the Indonesian state oil company Pertamina to develop an off-shore natural gas field, which could "mean new jobs for US businesses that help set up wells and off-shore platforms," the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> reported. Exxon's Indonesia affiliate and Pertamina are expected to sell the liquified gas almost exclusively in Asia. GE, Hughes, Fluor Daniel, and other major corporations won contracts as well for projects in Indonesia. Another Exxon-Pertamina project is a new plant to supply Indonesia's state-owned electricity company, the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> added, noting also that U.S. taxpayers are generously helping to fund the projects by credits from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, "part of new US `Tied-Aid' credit offers."

<P>All of this is sure to provide a huge flow of jobs for Americans -- at least lawyers, bankers, executives and managers, maybe a handful of skilled workers for a short period. But profits for U.S. investors? Perish the thought! The good news for U.S. workers caused a sharp increase in Exxon's stock.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.8" HREF="#FN1.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Another victory for efficient propaganda is that people wildly overestimate the percentage of the federal budget that goes to foreign aid and welfare. In fact, over half of discretionary federal spending is devoted to the military, one reason why "the United States faces social and structural economic problems of a magnitude unknown to other economically advanced states," Benjamin Schwarz of the RAND corporation notes, including "higher rates of infant mortality, illiteracy, malnutrition, and poverty than any other advanced industrialized country." All getting worse, predictably, as the class war of the past decades intensifies in vigor and savagery. A study of the Bread for the World Institute reported a considerable decline in people suffering from hunger throughout the world in the 1980s, with only two exceptions: Africa, which registered an increase from 36% to 37%, and the United States, where the numbers increased 50% from 1985 to 1990 as "conservative" reforms took hold, increasing since.

<P>The problem is most severe among children, with effects that are permanent: it is well-known that "development of the brain is strongly influenced by the quality of the nourishment and nurturance given to infants and children," among other effects of "adverse environments" early in life that can lead "to permanent defects in memory and learning" (medical researchers John Frank and Fraser Mustard). But hunger among the elderly is also "surging," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reports: "several million older Americans are going hungry -- and their numbers are growing steadily," despite a federal law in force for 20 years "aimed at providing free meals to anyone over 60." Many are literally "starving to death" while some 5 million, about 16% of the population over 60, "are either hungry or malnourished to some degree" -- again, phenomena unknown in other developed societies, which lag behind us in the crusade for freedom and justice. "The level of malnutrition and real hunger is only increasing," the assistant secretary for aging at the U.S. Department of Health reports.

<P>To fully comprehend the meaning of such facts, one must bear in mind the unparalleled advantages of the United States. To select merely one indication, health and life expectancy levels of mid-18th century Americans were not achieved by the <I>upper classes in Britain</I> until the early 20th century -- not to speak of less privileged parts of the world. The social and economic catastrophe of American capitalism is quite an extraordinary phenomenon -- for the "great beast," that is.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.9" HREF="#FN1.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Only 30% of the population are aware that military spending is the largest item on the Federal budget, and few of those know its scale or its purpose.  Over a quarter think foreign aid is the biggest item. In fact, it is barely detectable. The U.S. has the most miserly record among the developed countries. The record is even worse if we exclude the parts intended to enhance U.S. control over Middle East energy reserves, "aid" to Israel, Egypt, and Turkey. By far the largest per capita component goes to a rich country, Israel -- artificially rich, because of the completely unparalleled flow of foreign capital including not just "aid" but also tax-deductible contributions that are used to maintain the sharp divisions between first- and second-class citizens, and (despite disclaimers) for the joint U.S.-Israel project of incorporating the bulk of the occupied territories within the eventual state of Israel. Eliminate that, and U.S. aid virtually vanishes -- putting aside its character and effects.

<P>One-fifth of the population believe welfare to be the largest Federal expense. It is not too surprising, then, that the top priority for voters in 1994 was "welfare reform" (46%). The welfare system is "just out of control," voters felt, though it pays to look more closely at actual attitudes. 44% of respondents feel that we are spending "too much" on welfare and 23% "too little, economist Nancy Folbre notes, but when the phrase "assistance to the poor" is substituted for "welfare" in the same question, 13% say we are spending "too much" and 64% "too little." A reasonable speculation is that many people have absorbed Reaganite lies about "welfare Queens" (by insinuation, Black) driving Cadillacs, and believe that working people are supporting rich welfare recipients -- as they are, but not in the sense they imagine; we return to that.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.10" HREF="#FN1.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As already noted, the second-ranking priority for voters was health care reform (37%), though the impressive ideological warfare of the past year has left people utterly confused about what the realistic options might be. Public debate was framed within narrow bounds, the Clinton plan being the "liberal option," with a few gestures to the "radical extremists" who thought the U.S. might consider joining the rest of the industrial world. The incomprehensible Clinton plan -- basically, a giveaway to huge insurance companies -- was rejected as just another "big government" proposal that would place people's fate in the hands of pointy-headed bureaucrats who steal our money by imposing a crushing tax burden; a publicly funded insurance program, to the extent it could even be considered, is still more odious in that respect.

<P>The option preferred by the privileged is for the fate of everyone else to be in the hands of insurance company executives whose goal, as Milton Friedman can explain, is to ensure maximum profit and market share: meaning the worst possible health care; elimination of personal choice except for the rich; huge bureaucracies to micromanage physicians; public subsidy for advertising, profits, and multiple layers of high-paid managers and executives; and other massive inefficiencies that drive the U.S. off the spectrum in costs for heath care. The real meaning of the "conservative" option was illustrated right after the November election at the annual scientific convention of the American Heart Association, where leading specialists reported that insurers are increasingly unwilling to pay for preventive care that would reduce hospitalization rates by 75% (Dr. Lynne Stevenson of Boston's Brigham and Women's hospital). In contrast, they are quite willing to pay for heart transplants -- high tech operations that enrich the right people and institutions.

<P>One radical extremist thought that rarely reached threshold is that in a civilized society, the costs of health care should be borne by progressive taxation, on the basis of the principle that the poor should be exempted from taxation, which should "tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise" -- as observed by the noted Marxist Thomas Jefferson in a letter to his fellow-subversive James Madison. The United States is, again, off the spectrum on this aspect of human rights and needs, as measured by public share of health-care spending (which is as progressive as the tax system). The U.S. is far below any country that has achieved any form of development, even Greece and Portugal; it is barely above Turkey.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.11" HREF="#FN1.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>


<A NAME="SEC1.2"><H3>2. "Really existing conservatism"</H3></A>

<P>The propaganda victories come into sharper focus when we compare popular perceptions with social and economic realities. Take welfare. It has sharply declined in real terms since 1970, Nancy Folbre observes, a downward spiral that is continuing, with more reductions in Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in 1991 than in any year since 1981. From 1970, maximum AFDC benefits for a family of three with no other income fell over 40%, and the national average of AFDC benefits and food stamps combined is now at the level of AFDC alone in 1960 (before the food-stamp program was initiated).

<P>A still more severe distortion is the unspoken premise that child care is not work: it comes free, like women's domestic labor generally -- "the main reason why free-enterprise economies have worked relatively well over the decades," economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett comments. Child care therefore contrasts with Real Work: speculating in currency markets, devising tax shelters for the rich, arranging mergers and acquisitions that significantly reduce R&D and hence economic growth, and other contributions that rank high on the scale of social utility and merit according to standard dogma, which measures it by economic reward to the "worker." In particular, single women taking care of children are plainly not working, and therefore must be driven to the official workforce on grounds of "economic efficiency" (not to speak of justice), bipartisan doctrine holds. The assumptions are somewhere between nonsensical and insane, though reasonable enough within the general intellectual culture, with its tacit dedication to class warfare.

<P>Even on the narrowest grounds, Folbre observes in the American Economic Association proceedings, "public policy literally transfers resources from parents to nonparents by providing social insurance based on participation in paid employment without explicitly valuing time, effort, or money devoted to children," who are, in the longer term, the crucial factor determining "economic health" even in the highly distorted ideological sense of the technical notion. When real incomes in the middle quintile (about $30,000 in 1992 dollars) are adjusted for child care costs, they decline slightly through the 1970s, quite sharply from 1980 to the present as "conservatism triumphed."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.12" HREF="#FN1.12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Responding to the "public mood" that has been shaped by a propaganda offensive of unusual intensity and fervor, the highest priority for the new Gingrich conservatives is to dismantle the welfare system. They announced at once that they would repeal the Food Stamp Act of 1977, the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, the National School Lunch Act of 1946, the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983, and other Federals laws intended to prevent hunger, particularly among children, which has not increased rapidly enough to satisfy the advocates of "family values" and "free market" verities. Furthermore, what programs remain are to be transferred to states, so as to bar any response to the typical sharp increase in need for food assistance when there is a recession, as in 1991-2, when food stamp rolls sometimes grew by 300,000 people a month. The plans will "lead to a dramatic increase in hunger," Senator Patrick Leahy observed realistically; but that's nothing that has ever troubled the more loyal servants of the rich. Also on the legislative agenda -- with the support of the New Democrats -- are work obligations for mothers (who do not "work," by ideological fiat) and reduction of AFDC, the main Federal Welfare program, which reaches 14.3 million people, over 9 million of them young children, who must "learn responsibility" and internalize our values: that there are no human rights, apart from what can be won in the labor market.

<P>It would be unfair, however, to regard the leader, Newt Gingrich, as a heartless wretch. He proposes that the money saved from AFDC programs be used to build orphanages or "group homes" for children of families rendered destitute -- the state being the proper provider for children, not their mothers, under the doctrine of "family values." Perhaps the proposal is intended as a special contribution to the 1994 International Year of the Family. Or perhaps it is simply another useful federal subsidy, providing benefits to the construction industry, lawyers, and other people of the right sort.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.13" HREF="#FN1.13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The real meaning of "free market conservatism" is illustrated by a closer look at the most passionate enthusiasts for "getting the government off our backs" and letting the market reign undisturbed. Take Newt Gingrich, the leader of the victorious congressional army who are taking over under a "master plan" that relied on huge contributions for Gingrich's GOPAC committee from corporate donors and others whose identity is a carefully-guarded secret. The measures are of dubious legality; GOPAC is now being sued by the Federal Elections Commission on grounds that it "failed to register and report as a political committee." But legal questions aside, the power play was "a calculated political operation, unique on the contemporary American political scene" (Ellen Miller, director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics), yet another blow at the despised principles of democracy and the pretensions of the "great beast" to meddle where it doesn't belong.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.14" HREF="#FN1.14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Gingrich represents Cobb County Georgia, which the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> -- reasonably enough -- selected in a recent front-page story to illustrate the rising tide of "conservatism" aimed at ridding us of the "nanny state." The headline reads "Conservatism Flowering Among the Malls," in this wealthy suburb of Atlanta, one of several that "offer -- particularly to whites -- a sense of prosperity and safety, conservative Southern values and a relaxed, friendly way of life." It's a "Norman Rockwell world with fiber optic computers and jet airplanes," Gingrich comments with pride. With its "history of inhospitality toward blacks," Cobb County is scrupulously insulated from any urban infection so that the inhabitants can enjoy the fruits of their "enterpreneurial values" and market enthusiasms in "the conservative heart of a conservative region," defended in Congress by the leader of the conservative triumph.

<P>A small footnote: Cobb County receives more federal subsidies than any suburban county in the country, with two exceptions: Arlington Virginia, effectively part of the Federal Government, and Brevard County Florida, the home of the Kennedy Space Center. When we move out of the state system itself, Cobb County is the leading beneficiary of the "nanny state." Its largest employer is Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company, which is designing the F-22 advanced tactical fighter and other military aircraft. 72% of the workforce are in white-collar jobs "in expanding areas of the economy like insurance, electronics and computers, and trade" -- all carefully tended by "the nanny state." It's remarkably easy for conservative entrepreneurial values to flourish while one is feeding happily at the public trough. Meanwhile praises to market miracles reach the heavens, notably where "conservatism is flowering among the malls."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.15" HREF="#FN1.15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>An interesting sidelight is the silence over this matter during the electoral campaign, when Gingrich propaganda was smashing the New Democrats. Notably absent is a simple rejoinder that would have stopped the juggernaut in its tracks: Gingrich is the country's leading advocate of the welfare state -- for the rich. The reasons for the silence are not hard to discern: class interests prevail over narrow electoral ones. It's agreed across the board that the rich must be protected from market discipline by a powerful and interventionist welfare state.

<P>Gingrich is the author of the "Contract with America," which calls for extending the double-edged "free market": state protection and public subsidy for the rich, market discipline for the poor. The Contract calls for "cuts in social spending," denying aid to children of "minor mothers" and those on welfare. Republican leaders add that they will support reductions proposed in the plan submitted by John Kasich, top Republican on the Budget Committee; its biggest cut is to be $50 billion from medicare and medicaid, the health programs for the elderly and the poor. But the Contract calls for an increase in welfare for the rich, by the classic means: regressive fiscal measures, and outright subsidy. These include increased tax exemptions for gifts and estates, capital gains cuts, reduced regulation for protection of health and safety standards, investment subsidies, more favorable rules for depreciation, and most important: "strengthening our national defense" so that we can better "maintain our credibility around the world" -- so that anyone who gets funny ideas, like priests and nuns in Latin America, will understand that "What We Say Goes," as George Bush defined the New World Order while bombs and missiles were raining on Iraq.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.16" HREF="#FN1.16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>"National defense" is, of course, a sick joke, which would elicit ridicule outside of a commissar culture. The U.S. faces no threats, and already spends almost as much on "defense" as the rest of the world combined. As in the past, military spending is arguably increasing security threats, for example, by arms exports, which now provide 25% of revenue for "defense" contractors and dominate the international arms market, increasing sharply since the end of the Cold War. Clinton has just added an important innovation: for the first time, policy will "factor the health of U.S. weapons makers and the shape of the domestic economy into decisions on whether to approve foreign arms sales," the press reports; a natural step, now that the Soviet pretext has collapsed and it becomes necessary to face the facts more honestly.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.17" HREF="#FN1.17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Unlike "defense" and "security," military expenditures are no joke. They ensure that we will be able to "behave, with others, multilaterally when we can and unilaterally as we must," the Clinton version of the traditional doctrine, delivered to the UN Security Council by Ambassador Madeleine Albright as it wavered over a resolution condemning Iraq. Albright instructed the Council that if need be, the U.S. would act alone because "We recognize this area as vital to U.S. national interests" -- and we recognize no limits or constraints, surely nothing as ridiculous as international law, human rights, or the United Nations, as we pursue our role as self-appointed global enforcer.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.18" HREF="#FN1.18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Apart from maintaining a particular form of "stability" in the interests of the world rulers, the Pentagon must continue to provide lavishly for Newt Gingrich and his rich constituents by means of a taxpayer subsidy to advanced industry. Nothing has changed in this regard since the early post-war period, when the business world recognized that the aircraft industry, established by public funds and wartime profiteering, "cannot satisfactorily exist in a pure, uncompetitive, unsubsidized, `free enterprise' economy" (<CITE>Fortune</CITE>) and that "the government is their only possible savior" (<CITE>Business Week</CITE>). For well-known reasons, the Pentagon system was revitalized as the "savior," sustaining and expanding the industry, now the leading "civilian" exporter, along with steel and metals generally, electronics, chemicals, machine tools, and other central components of the industrial economy. As long as the fable could be sustained, the Cold War provided the pretext. The fraud was conscious, at least among those minimally astute. The first Secretary of the Air Force, Stuart Symington, put the matter plainly in January 1948: "The word to talk was not `subsidy'; the word to talk was `security'." As industry representative in Washington, Symington regularly demanded enough procurement funds in the military budget to "meet the requirements of the aircraft industry," in his words. The story continues without essential change until today, in just about every functioning sector of the economy, and surely in Cobb County.

<P>Furthermore, the story goes back to the origins of the Republic: economic historian Paul Bairoch describes the United States as the "mother country and bastion of modern protectionism," which was "born in the United States" -- which may be unfair to our British predecessors, no laggards in the art. Protectionism is only one form of state intervention, and not the major one. As in the British case, there are intermittent deviations from the commitment to protect the rich from market discipline, related to the expectation of temporary gain under conditions of dominance. When need arises, "conservatives" are quick to call for increased state intervention, as in the Reagan years. Had market forces been allowed to function, there would be no U.S. steel or automobile industry today, not to speak of computer chips and electronics generally. The Reaganites simply closed the market to Japanese competition while pouring in public funds.

<P>Then-Secretary of the Treasury, James Baker proudly proclaimed to a business audience that Reagan had "granted more import relief to US industry than any of his predecessors in more than half a century." He was far too modest: it was actually more all his predecessors combined, doubling import restrictions to 23%. One of the few authentic free trade advocates, international economist Fred Bergsten, added that the Reagan Administration specialized in the kind of "managed trade" that most "restricts trade and closes markets," voluntary export restraint agreements -- which are "voluntary" in the sense that protection payments to the Mafia enforcer are "voluntary." This is "the most insidious form of protectionism," Bergsten pointed out, which "raises prices, reduces competition and reinforces cartel behavior." The 1994 Economic Report to Congress estimates that Reaganite protectionist measures reduced US manufacturing imports by about one-fifth. Such measures have been expanded under Clinton, one recent example being the proposal to spend $1 billion to subsidize development and production of flat-panel computer display screens, subsidies barred by the GATT accords signed a few weeks earlier.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.19" HREF="#FN1.19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>This is just the tip of the iceberg. The "bought priesthood" may spin tales about market discipline and its virtues, but business executives and the government that is their "shadow" will tolerate no such nonsense -- for the rich, that is.

<P>Gingrich's Contract is remarkably brazen. Thus the proposals for welfare for the rich appear under the heading "The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act." The section does include a provision for measures "to create jobs and raise worker wages" -- with the word "unfunded" quietly added. But no matter. In contemporary Newspeak, the word "jobs" means "profits," so it is indeed a "job creation" proposal, which will continue to "enhance" wages downwards.

<P>The pattern is virtually exceptionless. Former Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell was replaced in November by Olympia Snowe, a prominent conservative, whose campaign focused on protecting the Portsmouth Naval shipyard and Loring Air Force base -- that is, making sure that Federal largesse continues to flow, the benefits heavily skewed towards the wealthy, though the official mantra is "jobs." Even looking just at the narrow matter of welfare, we find much the same thing. The Center for Popular Economics (Amherst) estimates that when we consider direct benefits and tax breaks -- masked welfare payments -- an average household with income under $10,000 receives about 60% of the welfare provided to households with income over $100,000. Looking at details, total payments for food stamps in 1993 amounted to $25 billion, welfare and family support $16 billion, and supplemental security income (poor, elderly, disabled) $21 billion. These figures may be compared with the $49 billion in deductions for interest payments, mostly mortgage payments (80% to familes with incomes over $50,000, skewed more radically toward the higher reaches, for obvious reasons). Farm price supports, again skewed toward the wealthy, amounted to $16 billion. Total payments to the poor "add up to less than the three largest tax breaks that benefit the middle class and wealthy: deductions for retirement plans, the deduction for home mortgage interest and the exemption of health-insurance premiums that companies pay for their employees," Michael Wines reports in the <CITE>Times</CITE> in a rare window opened to the real world, noting further that "most tax breaks and payments to the well-situated are practically exempt from the debate over controlling expenditures."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.20" HREF="#FN1.20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>This, of course, is the merest fragment, not counting such matters as "business expenses" (dinners at elegant restaurants, prize seats at the opera and sporting events, club memberships, etc.), all small in comparison with the massive subsidies through the system of protection and subsidy by the "nanny state." Simply to indicate scale, in Canada, less extreme than the U.S. in its dedication to a nanny state for the rich, the National Council of Welfare estimates that day care facilities for the 750,000 children who need them would cost $1.5 billion, not a great deal more than the tax money lost by the business entertainment deduction.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.21" HREF="#FN1.21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Reacting to the "Contract," Labor Secretary Robert Reich suggested that Congress end "corporate welfare as we know it," removing tax breaks for particular industries and agriculture that amount to tens of billions a year. He also noted that over a quarter of taxes go to pay interest on the national debt, most of it accumulated by the statist reactionaries of the 1980s, who played their spend-and-borrow games under the conservative disguise. Reich's speech on economic and social policy was prominently reported -- in the London <CITE>Financial Times,</CITE> though for accuracy, it did receive a few lines under "World-Wide Notes" in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal,</CITE> the same day.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.22" HREF="#FN1.22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The principles are clear and explicit: free markets are fine for the Third World and its growing counterpart at home. Mothers with dependent children can be sternly lectured on the need for self-reliance, but not dependent executives and investors, please. For them, the welfare state must flourish.

<P>Focusing on rich countries like ours is highly misleading, to put it mildly. The double-edged "free market ideology" has by far its most lethal effects in the traditional colonial domains, which, apart from the Japan-based area, are mostly an utter disaster, improving here and there only by ideologically-based economic measures that dispense with effects on people. While almost all industrial societies have become more protectionist in past years, the Reaganites generally led the pack. The effects on the South have been devastating, compounding the consequences of the IMF-World Bank structural adjustment programs, which have had a brutal impact on the poor majority while benefiting foreign investors and elite sectors linked to them.

<P>Market distortions by the rich have been a major factor in doubling the already huge gap between the poorest and richest countries in the past generation. The 1992 UN Development Report estimates that various protectionist and financial measures taken by the rich countries have deprived the South of $1/2 trillion a year, about 12 times total "aid" -- most of it publicly-subsidized export promotion. This behavior is "virtually criminal," the distinguished Irish diplomat and author Erskine Childers observed recently. He also notes that the West, under U.S. lead, blocked a 1991 resolution tabled at the General Assembly by the South against "economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries," the favored technique, apart from terror, by which the U.S. has sought to destroy such independent upstarts as Cuba and Nicaragua -- while never ceasing to sing odes to the free market. The fact is "very little known," Childers writes, "because of course such things do not get reported by the dominant Northern media." He hopes that some day this "wholesale moral abdication by Northern countries" will lead to "their utter shame before their own citizens," shame that will "start on the day when Northern academicians and NGOs" institute "a Blackmail Watch" to stand alongside the Human Rights Watches.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.23" HREF="#FN1.23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Not tomorrow, we can be sure of that.

<P>With hopelessly inadequate apologies to the victims, I'll put aside that terrible story of major crimes against humanity, for which we bear continuing responsibility.

<P>Next month, I'll turn to two topics: the specific measures that are being used to control the surplus population, and the general background against which these crimes against humanity proceed. The former include the growing "crime industry," unrelated to crime but closely related to the need to cage those growing categories of the population who have no role to play in enriching the wealthy and privileged, and therefore lack rights by "conservative" values. Another striking component is the war against families and children that was led by Reagan-Thatcher conservatives and is now to be sharply enhanced. Yet another is the effort to restore something like the Satanic Mills of the early period of industrialization, for those who retain some rights under reigning values. All of this is entirely reasonable, as major tendencies in the global economy of the past quarter century have at least raised the possibility that the world might be driven to an extreme form of totalitarian domination by wealthy and powerful sectors, with the gains for human rights, freedom, and democracy won in bitter struggle over centuries now reversed -- a shift from "containment" to "rollback," to borrow some of the (largely deceitful) terminology of foreign policy discussion.

<P>The new year opened auspiciously with the announcement of the revolutionary agenda of the "conservatives," responding to the "popular mandate" conferred by their "landslide victory" -- in which they gained 50.5 percent of the votes of the minority who took part and were overwhelmingly opposed by non-voters, while one-sixth of those who did vote regarded the outcome as "an affirmation of the Republican agenda" and one out of nine saw "a more conservative Congress" as an issue. Meanwhile large majorities, as usual, favored more government spending for domestic programs and more help for the poor, reduced military spending, and other traditional parts of the "liberal agenda" that the population had overwhelmingly repudiated, according to standard doctrine.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.1" HREF="#FN2.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>


<A NAME="SEC2.1"><H3>1. The Conservative Agenda</H3></A>

<P>The "conservatives" -- I'll adopt the term, reluctantly -- cannot be faulted for concealing what they have in mind. Their agenda hews closely to the traditional double-edged conception of markets, personal responsibility, freedom from government interference, and so on. The slogans are to be interpreted literally and harshly for everyone -- apart from the rich minority, who are exempt from such strictures. Quite the contrary. The interests of the privileged are to be enhanced by a powerful and interventionist "nanny state," which transfers vast public subsidies to them and otherwise caters to their whims. Newt Gingrich's conservative constituents in their wealthy Atlanta suburb cannot be expected to face market discipline. They must maintain their lead among recipients of public subsidies, so that they can bask in self-praise for their "independence" and "entrepreneurial values," and indulge in their "visceral distaste" for the federal government that fills their pockets with public funds -- without which, they would soon join the laggards and spongers they despise.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.2" HREF="#FN2.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Clinton's first response to the "conservative landslide" was to increase Pentagon spending, already high even by Cold War levels. He announced an increase of $25 billion over the next six years, directly contravening the public will; the Gingrich "Contract with America" calls for $60 billion. As well understood within the business community, the Pentagon is a central component of the "nanny state" -- for the rich, Gingrich's constituents in particular.

<P>The new Republican leadership opened their campaign with plans for "welfare reform." The proposals are fine-tuned to the principles of class warfare. By far the largest entitlements (among those that are mentionable, that is) are Social Security and Medicare. But benefits under these programs are not class-based: not only the poor reach retirement age. Furthermore, funding of Social Security is sufficiently regressive to make it more tolerable. These huge and rapidly growing programs are therefore not on the "conservative agenda" -- for now; as policy marches on from containment of human rights and democracy to rollback, they too are unlikely to survive, since the wealthy can prosper without them. The programs that face radical cuts are food stamps, AFDC, and Medicaid. AFDC reaches 14 million people who are destitute, 9.7 million of them children; it has declined sharply since 1970, particularly since the Reagan years. Medicaid provides health care for 33 million people who cannot afford it. Though a small fragment of officially-recognized "welfare," these programs are designed to help people who are weak and defenseless, therefore subject to market discipline and the demands of "personal responsibility."

<P>The reforms are still more finely honed. The food stamp program is likely to survive, the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reports, because it has a "middle-class constituency that includes farmers, grocers, and the food industry generally." Agribusiness, great marketing chains, and the transnationals that dominate the food industry are a "middle class constituency" with human rights. But AFDC lacks these merits. Over five million children are to be deprived of its meager support, though they "would not be harmed" by losing their subsistence, Republican House leaders assure us, because "adults on welfare will protect their children by working or getting married" -- taking jobs that do not provide a living wage (if they even exist), and marrying men who can join the surging prison population when they fail to find work.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.3" HREF="#FN2.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The planned tax cuts reveal the same refined sensibility. They are designed to benefit "the truly wealthy," the <CITE>Times</CITE> editors accurately comment, including "capital gains tax cuts and depreciation write-offs for business" that will "run the deficit up even higher," and that should properly be called transfer payments from the poor to the rich. Other tax cuts are supposedly intended to benefit "the middle class." The category includes people who earn up to $100,000 a year (more than 96 percent of taxpayers) as the President defines the term, and up to $200,000 a year (more than 99 percent of taxpayers) under the Republican definition. That means "there is almost no one left to pick up the tab," so the burden is placed overwhelmingly on the shoulders of those least able to bear it. The major "middle class" tax cut a credit for dependent children, a regressive measure that offers little or nothing to people too poor to take advantage of it. That aside, it benefits primarily the rich: "Generally, the more income that taxpayers have, the more likely they are to have dependent children," the <CITE>Times</CITE> reports: "For instance, 55 percent of taxpayers with incomes from $100,000 to $200,000 in 1991 claimed at least one exemption for a dependent," as compared with 42 percent in the $30,000-$35,000 range (close to the actual "middle class").

<P>The tax cuts too are hailed by their bipartisan advocates as a response to the popular will, which was revealed by a Harris poll after the elections. Two-thirds felt the state of the nation was not good. Their reasons varied, including high taxes -- selected by three percent.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.4" HREF="#FN2.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The "hidden welfare state" for the rich, with its huge entitlements concealed by tax deductions and other devious means, scarcely enters the debate over welfare reform. But it is by no means unaffected. "Buried in the House Republicans' `Contract with America' is a very sweet deal for the nation's big capital-intensive companies," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reported in December, reviewing an array of tax breaks and other devices that will "provide a sizable subsidy" to corporations, possibly eliminating taxable income entirely for large firms, and increasing the deficit in accord with the Reaganite version of "fiscal conservatism." The program is carefully crafted so that its impact will not be felt until 1997 -- coincidentally, after the presidential election, something we are not supposed to notice. IRS officials predict a cost to the taxpayer of over $14 billion a year by the end of the decade.

<P>Reacting to the Gingrich Contract, Labor Secretary Robert Reich gave a speech last November in which he suggested ending "Corporate welfare as we know it"; it was reported in the business press abroad, and received a few words in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> as well. The <CITE>Journal</CITE> returned to the topic a few weeks later in an article by Alan Murray on the tax breaks that "shower billions in benefits on the oil and gas, timber, cattle-breeding and real-estate industries and others," one minor component of the "nanny state" for the rich. Murray referred to "Mr. Reich's broadside against corporate welfare," noting that it "was quickly shot down by friendly fire" from the White House and Cabinet. The Administration had discussed cutting back the "$114 billion of spending over the next five years that benefits specific industries, as well as $110 billion in tax subsidies," some for single industries, some aimed at public funding of advertising and purchase of mansions (through tax subsidies). All such ideas are "going nowhere," however, and "already have been taken off the table."

<P>The mood was symbolized at the first triumphal session of the new Congress, with the Gingrich army in charge. In a "half-hearted" gesture, House Democrats sought "to embarrass Republicans for declining to include a ban on lobbyists' gifts in the new rules," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> mentioned on p. 16. There was also brief notice in the <CITE>Times,</CITE> quoting the reaction of the Commander-in-Chief himself. Gingrich said he'd "heard rumors that imply that they're just into sort of a fairly stupid strategy of cheap and nasty," which "makes one wonder just how dumb they think the American people are." Imagine how the public would react to the idea of making it harder for corporations to purchase votes in our model democracy.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.5" HREF="#FN2.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>State governments are responding to the "popular mandate" the same way. In New York, a draft proposal of Governor-elect George Pataki's administration calls for a cut of over $1 billion in Medicaid, while Mayor Rudolph Giuliani proposed a 25 percent reduction in Medicaid and other help for the poor. To better comprehend these measures, one may bear in mind that in Manhattan the income gap between rich and poor is greater than in Guatemala, and within the U.S. is surpassed only by a group of 70 households in a former leper colony in Hawaii. The gap widened in the 1980s more than in any other county with over 50,000 people.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.6" HREF="#FN2.6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The justification for such budgetary proposals is dual: the "popular mandate" that overwhelmingly opposes them, and the lack of funds. The mandate is beyond challenge: "Americans Like G.O.P. Agenda," a lead story is headlined in the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> citing data showing that 65 percent of the public believe "the Government has a responsibility to take care of the poor" while 9 percent think "programs for poor children" should be decreased. Support for a balanced budget amendment is equally impressive: "22 percent, if it would require cuts in spending on education," and comparable figures if other cuts in social spending are contemplated.

<P>Equally beyond challenge is the "fact" that there just isn't enough money available in this "lean and mean" age. Times are tough all over, particularly for the great corporations that are enjoying "dazzling" profits, <CITE>Fortune</CITE> magazine exults. Meanwhile <CITE>Business Week</CITE> worries over "The Problem Now: What To Do With All That Cash" (headline), as "surging profits" are "overflowing the coffers of Corporate America" and dividends are booming, thanks in large measure to profits from overseas operations (in the interest of "jobs for Americans"). Meanwhile the Census bureau reports that 95 percent of the population has lost income since 1989, with a 7 percent decline in median family income, continuing through the "Clinton recovery." Real hourly pay (including benefits) has fallen 1 percent a year for the median male since 1979, including the 1991-93 recovery years, labor economists Jared Bernstein and Lawrence Mishel report.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.7" HREF="#FN2.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Less delighted are city governments, which will face the problems created as federal government and the states shift benefits towards the wealthy even more than under the prevailing norms. Meeting in December, the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported that requests by needy people increased by 12 percent in 1994, requests for emergency shelter even more. 15 percent of requests for emergency food aid had to be denied, along with almost 1/4 of requests by homeless families, who remained homeless an average of 9 months. The Mayors' Conference called for an increase in federal assistance programs, responding to a different "popular mandate" than the one that is perceived by the political class and media elite: the popular mandate reflected consistently in polls but irrelevant to policy, which is "insulated from politics," to borrow a useful phrase from the London <CITE>Economist.</CITE><SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.8" HREF="#FN2.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Another target is foreign aid, "already by far the lowest of any major industrialised country as a proportion of gross domestic product," the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> observes, and virtually non-existent if we eliminate the grants to the primary recipient (Israel, a rich first world country, thanks to unprecedented subsidy from abroad) and the secondary beneficiaries, to make sure they play their role in guaranteeing U.S. control over Middle East energy reserves. Senator Mitch McConnell, who will chair the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, announced that aid should be restricted to advancing "America's security and economic interests." That is overwhelmingly true already, but the principle must be implemented more harshly still. The pennies that go to Africa, for example, serve almost no useful purpose, merely helping human beings. While aid to most countries should be cut, McConnell announced, aid to the Middle East should be increased: primarily to Israel, then to other Middle East gendarmes.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.9" HREF="#FN2.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Also facing the axe are regulatory measures, mostly unenforced by the criminal state during the Reagan years, a primary reason for the collapse of unions and the sharp rise in industrial accidents, <CITE>Business Week</CITE> reported in an important cover story. New proposals aim to reduce or eliminate such "market distortions," which merely save lives at the cost of profits. These December 1994 announcements were exquisitely timed, coinciding with new disclosures about the effects of the failure to control predatory profit-seeking. On December 19, the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> reviewed the destruction of the Georges Bank fishing grounds off the New England coast, formerly one of the world's richest. Parts had to be closed completely in mid-December, with more drastic actions anticipated, in the hope that the fish population, virtually depleted, might recover -- a vain hope, many scientists fear. After the area was closed to foreign boats by a 200-mile fishing limit declared in 1976, U.S. fishing operations nearly doubled, spurred by government tax credits. The predictable result of state subsidy and lack of regulation was to decimate populations of cod, haddock, and other major stocks. Cod may become "virtually extinct," the Northeast Fisheries Science Center predicted. New England, the traditional home of codfish, is now importing its cod from Norway. The government of Norway "took strong measures to stop overfishing years ago," following a "different philosophical tradition from North America," one that allows the government, in the public interest, to place some controls on "economic actors" (Kare Bryn, director of the resources department in Norway's fisheries ministry). The "philosophical tradition" here is quite different, allowing the government only to offer massive protection and public subsidy to business interests in accord with our deep-seated libertarian commitments.

<P>"In the 1980s," the vice-chair of the government Fishery Management Council concedes, "there was not enough conservation and too much concern about the impacts it would have" (on short-term profit, to be precise). "I think everybody regrets that now, but that's like crying over spilled milk." The regrets are revealed by the passionate dedication to dismantle what is left of the regulatory apparatus so as to maximize the scale of future tragedies.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.10" HREF="#FN2.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The day after this report was published, President Clinton announced his plans to implement the "conservative program," with cuts in government spending (apart from the Pentagon subsidy to the rich, which is to increase). The major cuts are to be in the Energy department, slowing down cleanup of nuclear waste, cutting research, and turning management of the petroleum reserve to "private enterprise" -- the term is even more of a joke than usual, in reference to the energy industry. The same day, the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reported new scientific evidence on the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming. Satellite data revealed that industrial gases are the primary factor in depletion of the ozone layer, which scientists fear might spread over northern areas; and satellites also provided the most precise data yet available on rise of the sea level, showing it to be within the range predicted by global warming models. The potential threat to human life is not trivial.

<P>Also on the same day, the staff of the House Health and Environment Subcommittee released a report reviewing tobacco industry data purporting to show that secondhand smoke is not a significant hazard in workplaces. The data had been a "significant element" in industry campaigns to bar regulation, the report observed. The data were "faked," according to workers who took the measurements. The conclusion was supported by the House committee's research staff and an independent review by a chemist at the Naval Research Laboratory. When the fakery is corrected, the hazard proves to be considerably higher. Is that a surprise, when an industry "regulates" itself? Perhaps to really dedicated commissars. Incoming chair Thomas Bliley of Virginia, "an industry champion" (<CITE>Business Week</CITE>), refused to comment.

<P>Other efforts to save lives from depredations by the rulers are also to decline under the conservative regimen. Among other consequences, the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety & Health Administration are likely to lose much of their limited effect, and pharmaceutical prescriptions may not have to provide information about safe drug use. The basic plan is to impose conditions on any regulatory statute that will be almost impossible to meet: for example, largely meaningless "cost-benefit analyses" that can be extended without limit by corporate lawyers of even limited intelligence.

<P>The human consequences are not hard to predict, but short-term profit will increase for the publicly-subsidized "private" sector of the economy. Civilization marches on.

<P>Other proposed measures lead in the same direction. One component of the current crusade is to shift such government funding as remains to the states (outside of the expanding "nanny state" for the wealthy). It is anticipated that state governments will be much more susceptible to the influence of private tyranny, which overwhelms local populations in resources and can play one against another in the time-honored fashion. An illustration, reported just as the crusade was launched, is the effect of the decision by Congress in 1991 to transfer control over transportation funds to the states. Of the $35 billion that has gone to them so far, 96 percent was used for highway projects, in violation of the intent of the legislation to support mass transit, according to the chair of the House Committee on Public Works and Transporation, Norman Mineta, one of its authors. Some attribute this "massive institutional civil disobedience" to pressures from "entrenched highway construction interests," but a look back to the huge federal social engineering projects that destroyed public transportation and "suburbanized America" in the interests of dominant components of the corporate sector suggests broader goals. President Clinton's first proposed reductions should accelerate the process. "One such cut would reduce Federal spending for highway, bridge, airport and rail infrastructure for $5 billion and give the states more discretion on spending the rest" (<CITE>NYT</CITE>): "The end result could be more potholes and higher fares for many taxpayers." One can guess, perhaps, that mass transport will end up being the primary target, as plans reach practice.

<P>The basic principles have long been familiar, and are sometimes articulated plainly enough. After a recent series of ferry disasters in the Baltic with hundreds of lives lost, the former president of Britain's Royal Institution of Naval Architects pointed out that measures to overcome the problems are well understood, but owners won't follow them "unless they are forced. You choose whether you have regulation or let thousands more people die." The stakes here are far greater, but the principle is the same. Short-term gain for the privileged few might be impaired if the welfare of the general population and future generations is taken into consideration, and under the "civilized values" that Newt Gingrich and other rollback advocates seek to instill, the relative weights are clear.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.11" HREF="#FN2.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>


<A NAME="SEC2.2"><H3>2. The Surplus Population</H3></A>

<P>When the doctrines of contemporary "neoliberalism" were crafted in early 19th century England, the message to the population was clear and simple: under capitalism, you have no rights, apart from what your labor will bring in the market. A person without independent wealth "has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is," Malthus proclaimed in highly influential work. It is a "great evil" and violation of "natural liberty" to mislead the poor into believing that they have further rights, David Ricardo held, outraged at this assault against the principles of economic science, which are as immutable as the principles of gravitation, he held, and against the moral principles on which the science rests, no less exalted. The message is simple. You have a free choice: the labor market, the workhouse prison, death, or go somewhere else -- as was possible when vast spaces were opening thanks to the extermination and expulsion of indigenous populations.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.12" HREF="#FN2.12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The doctrines are being revived, but under radically different conditions. Ricardo's "science" was founded on the principle that capital is more or less immobile and labor highly mobile. We are enjoined today to worship the consequences of Ricardo's science, despite the fact that the assumptions on which they are based have been reversed: capital is highly mobile, and labor virtually immobile -- libertarian conservatives lead the way in rejecting Adam Smith's principle that "free circulation of labor" is a cornerstone of free trade, in keeping with their contempt for markets (except for the weak). Other assumptions of the "science" are so radically false that the whole topic is hard to take seriously: among them, the abstraction from severe market distortions resulting from the centrally-managed transactions of the huge corporate structures that dominate the international economy, and the reliance on the "nanny state" that has been such a decisive factor in economic growth and the specific forms it has taken throughout history, and remains so.

<P>The science originated as a weapon of class warfare, has been adapted for similar ends over the years. It is returning to its origins today as the prospects for rollback improve, narrowing substantially the choices for the growing population who lack rights by doctrinal decision -- termed "science" or "natural law."

<P>The surplus population has to be kept in ignorance, but also controlled. The problem is faced directly in the Third World domains that have long been dominated by the West and therefore reflect the guiding values of the masters most clearly: here favored devices include death squads, "social cleansing," torture, and other techniques of proven effectiveness. At home, more civilized methods are (still) required. The superfluous population is to be cooped up within urban slums that increasingly resemble concentration camps, or if that fails, sent to prisons, the counterpart in a richer society to the death squads we train and support in our domains. Under Reaganite enthusiasts for state power, the number of prisoners in the U.S. almost tripled, leaving our main competitors, South Africa and Russia, well behind -- though Russia has just caught up, now that they are mastering the values of their American tutors.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.13" HREF="#FN2.13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The bipartisan crime bill should facilitate the process of controlling the unwanted population, with its vast new expenditures for prisons, sharp increase in the death penalty, and much harsher sentencing procedures. Again, this is an acceptable form of state action, serving the social function of population control and providing yet another Keynesian stimulus to the economy: to the construction industry, lawyers, security personnel, and so on. The public subsidy of the "crime industry" is coming to approach the scale of the Pentagon, though it is less favored: its benefits are not so sharply skewed towards the wealthy. Nonetheless, it's reasonable that Gingrich's Contract should call for expanding this aspect of the war against the general public.

<P>The crime rate has not changed significantly for twenty years, and recently has declined, if official figures can be taken seriously. The FBI reported in early December that crime rates in 1994 decreased to the lowest level since 1986 for overall crime, since 1990 for violent crime, and since 1985 for property crime (though white collar crime is only sporadically reported). But punishment has gone up fast, as the rate of incarceration shows, and in highly restricted ways, targeting the most vulnerable sectors, mainly Blacks and Latinos; the close race-class correlation in the U.S. makes the procedure only more natural. These sectors are regarded as a criminal population, one leading criminologist, William Chambliss, concludes from recent studies, including direct observation by students and faculty in a project with the Washington police. That's not exactly correct. Criminals are supposed to have constitutional rights, but as his on-the-scene studies show, these communities do not. They are effectively under military occupation. "Young Black and Latino men living in America's ghettos and barrios are under siege from, and at war with, the police," Chambliss writes.

<P>The 1994 Crime Bill is designed to increase the prison population and the costs of maintaining it, with little if any effect on crime. The "three strikes" provision ensures that people will remain in prison long past the age when criminal actions are likely, as has much research has shown; and the aging population will either require minimal (and costly) care or be left to die, in keeping with expansion of the right to kill granted to state authority under contemporary libertarian doctrine. The Crime Bill also ends funding for vocational and other training (Pell Grants), slight expenditures that markedly decrease recidivism and prison violence. Such measures make no sense as part of a "war against crime." They make a lot of sense, however, as part of a war against the population, with two aspects: removal of people superfluous for profit-making, and control of the large majority targeted for reduction of quality of life and opportunity, who must be somehow frightened into submission to authority.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.14" HREF="#FN2.14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The largely fraudulent "drug war" has served as an effective device for this population control program. Criminalization of drugs has increased crime -- including crime by government agencies from local police to the CIA -- though studies show no effect on drug availability or use, and decriminalization, where it has been tried, seems to have increased neither. In 1992, nearly 30 percent of state and over 55 percent of federal prisoners were convicted on drug charges (a third for marijuana). Two-thirds of these arrests were for possession, not sale or manufacture. One finds few executives of banks or chemical corporations in prison, though banks are surely involved in money laundering -- a banking subsidiary of American Express just paid $32 million in a settlement in a money-laundering case, with no criminal charges<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.15" HREF="#FN2.15">15</A></FONT></SUP> -- and the government estimates that more than 90 percent of the chemicals used to produce cocaine come from the United states. A Reagan-era CIA study concluded that U.S. exports of such chemicals to Latin America far exceed amounts used for any legal commercial purpose, concluding that they are diverted to heroin and cocaine production.

<P>It has been well-documented that the drug business has trailed U.S. subversive and counterinsurgency activities quite closely since the CIA helped re-establish the Mafia-run heroin racket in France after World War II as part of the program to undermine the labor movement and the anti-fascist resistance. The reasons are also too well known to recount. The latest phase, unsurprisingly, involves Afghanistan, where the U.S. spent billions of dollars through the 1980s in support of the Islamic fundamentalist extremist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who has taken the lead in tearing to shreds what remained of the shattered country after the Russian invaders withdrew. The <CITE>Far Eastern Economic Review</CITE> reports that 1994 opium production in Afghanistan is the biggest crop the world has ever seen, enabling Afghanistan and Pakistan (the base for the CIA operations) to win first place in world heroin-production, overtaking the Golden Triangle that gained that status as a by-product of U.S. subversion and aggression a generation ago.

<P>"It is now widely accepted," the <CITE>Review</CITE> reports, "that the U.S. deliberately played down heroin production by the mujahideen during these years" (1980-89), causing at least one DEA agent to resign in disgust because of the CIA's protection of known druglords. One consequence is that Pakistan, with no significant drug problem in 1980, now has perhaps as many as 2 million heroin addicts, while heroin-export earnings amount to about 20 percent of its formal exports, a UN report estimates. Most of the heroin produced ends up in the United States.

<P>The leading drug-producing center in the Western hemisphere, Colombia, gives more insight into the nature of the "drug war." The leading human rights violator in the hemisphere, Colombia also receives the most U.S. military aid, now more than half of what goes to the entire hemisphere, increasing under Clinton. The Jesuit-based Justice and Peace <CITE>Bulletin</CITE> just published a study of human rights abuses during the last year of the administration of Cesar Gaviria, Washington's favorite, recently imposed as Secretary-General of the OAS in a Washington power-play that was much resented. The general picture is horrendous, as before, but the "anti-drug strategy" is particularly relevant here. Colombia had two major cartels: Medellin and Cali. The Medellin cartel, the <CITE>Bulletin</CITE> reports, "evolved out of popular low class origins with a marked tendency to show off its wealth ostentatiously and act in a `Robin Hood'-like manner, implementing social projects in poor areas of the city and with a military apparatus separate from and threatening and aggressive towards the government," which is regarded as an enemy by much of the population. The Cali cartel, "with aristocratic upper class roots, discreet and careful to camouflage and blend its wealth in with that of the country's well-to-do industrialists and businessmen, infiltrated into all of the government's spheres of influence and power with a military apparatus allied and coordinated with government armed forces."

<P>The two cartels were accorded very different treatment. The Gaviria administration destroyed the Medellin cartel in military operations that involved massacres, large-scale torture, disappearances, and illegal arrests. The Cali cartel has had a more pleasant fate, including leaders who were "involved in horrible massacres carried out in alliance with members of the armed forces." It now enjoys "absolute territorial domination and control" in major drug-producing regions, where paramilitary groups allied with the military have established "veritable strongholds."

<P>Nevertheless, the Cali cartel is harshly treated in comparison to the leading narcotrafficking mobsters. It is conventional and convenient to externalize the issue, focusing attention on evil creatures in foreign lands who poison our children and destroy our cities. A useful corrective is offered in a study by the OECD (the organization of the wealthy industrial societies), reviewed in Mexico's main journal <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> by Apolinar Biaz-Callejas of the Andean Commission of Jurists and the Latin American Association for Human Rights. The OECD study found that "the money produced by drug trafficking throughout the world reached $460 billion in 1993, of which the U.S. received $260 billion, which is circulated through its financial system, in contraband, and through other ways. Colombia, as a producer-exporter, gets only $5 to $7 billion, or 2 to 3 percent of what remains in the U.S. The big business is, therefore, in that country," veiled in anonymity and beyond reach of law.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.16" HREF="#FN2.16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>At home, both criminal law and police practice are "blatantly racist," Chambliss concludes. Blacks constitute two-thirds of prisoners in state prisons convicted of drug offenses and 40 percent of all drug arrests, though more Whites than Blacks use illegal drugs and more than 80 percent of the population is White. Possession of a small amount of crack cocaine, the drug of choice in the ghetto, "carries a mandatory five-year prison sentence without the possibility of parole but possession of a hundred times that amount of cocaine powder (the drug of choice of the white middle class) has no mandatory sentence."

<P>While crime has not changed much in scale or character in the last twenty years, perceptions have. The perceptions did not precede and motivate government crime laws, as has been claimed by James Q. Wilson and other conservative scholars. Rather, as polls show, concerns were stimulated by right-wing political elements, primarily from the 1960s. In that period, Chambliss points out, crime could serve as "a smokescreen" to conceal other issues "as well as legitimation for legislation designed primarily to suppress political dissent and overturn Supreme Court decisions."

<P>Blacks are particularly targeted because they are defenseless and have little influence. And engendering fear is, of course, a standard method of population control, whether the chosen targets are Blacks, Jews, immigrants, homosexuals, or whatever. These are the basic reasons, it seems, for the growth of "the crime control industry." Not that crime isn't a real threat to safety and survival. It certainly is, particularly for the poor. But the problem is not being addressed; rather, used as a method of population control, in various ways.

<P>Children are also vulnerable and defenseless, hence another fit target for conservatives-on-the-march. The matter has recently been addressed in several important books, one a 1993 UNICEF study by U.S. economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett that deals with child care in rich societies, another by the Canadian writer Linda McQuaig, the #1 bestseller in Canada for 23 weeks.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.17" HREF="#FN2.17">17</A></FONT></SUP> Studying the past 15 years, Hewlett finds a sharp split between Anglo-American societies and those of continental Europe and Japan; McQuaig finds the same effect, and focuses on the consequences for Canada as it shifts towards the Reagan-Thatcher model. This model, Hewlett writes, has been a "disaster" for children and families; the European-Japanese model, in contrast, has improved their situation considerably. Both authors attribute the Anglo-American "disaster" to the ideological preference for free markets. That's only half true: whatever one chooses to call the reigning ideology, it is unfair to tarnish the good name of "conservatism" by applying it to this form of violent, lawless, reactionary statism, which despises markets almost as much as it does democracy and freedom.

<P>Causes aside, there isn't much doubt about the effects of the free market for the weak, what Hewlett calls the "anti-child spirit [that] is loose in these lands" subjected to the "neglect-filled Anglo-American model," which has largely privatized child-rearing while making it effectively impossible for most of the population. The result is a predictable disaster for children and families, while in the "much more supportive `European' model," social policy has strengthened support systems for families and children.

<P>It's no great secret. A Blue-Ribbon Commission of the National Association of State Boards of Education and the American Medical Association concluded in 1990 that "Never before has one generation of children been less healthy, less cared for or less prepared for life than their parents were at the same age" -- though only in the Anglo-American societies, where an anti-child, anti-family spirit has reigned for 15 years under the guise of "conservatism" and "family values." This is yet another triumph of the "bought priesthood," as the independent working class press referred to the intellectual servants of power a century ago, before free expression was overcome by state repression and market forces.

<P>Conservatives are not devoted only to children and families, but also to the "middle classes," which have declined under their rule to levels well below those of comparable countries (Japan, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, etc.) as society is split more sharply into rich and poor. The gap has so widened that the director of the respected Luxembourg Income Study, U.S. economist Timothy Smeeding, shocked Congress with data showing that the U.S. tolerates "a level of disadvantage unknown to any other major country on earth."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.18" HREF="#FN2.18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>New York City, mentioned earlier, happens to be an extreme case, but the pattern is quite general, and even extends to U.S. domains. Latin America is the region of traditional U.S. influence. It also has the most extreme inequality in the world, thanks in large measure to specific policies designed to prevent a form of "economic nationalism" which, it was feared, would lead to more egalitarian and independent development. The current favorites are typical in that regard, from Mexico to Argentina.

<P>Mexico's neoliberal achievements were lauded effusively until the bubble burst in recent weeks. The achievements included slow economic growth despite a huge flow of foreign assistance to make the miracle work, falling real wages, and growing inequality. The Mexican government concedes that "the number of citizens living below the poverty line has increased from 13 million in 1990 to 24 million in 1994." Closely tracking this impressive record, the number of billionaires rose from 13 in 1993 to 24 in 1994 (as compared with one in 1987). So <CITE>Forbes</CITE> magazine reported in its annual review of the "swelling roster of global billionaires" in the global economy, so short of capital that the great mass of the population must be crushed. The Mexican billionaires achieved their exalted status mostly in league with the state authorities. The biggest gift horse has been "privatization": the giveaway of public resources, "under very generous terms for investors," political economist John Summa observes with cautious understatement. Economist David Barkin adds that "the privatization of Mexico's government holdings was systematically channeled to President Salinas' `cronies,' to use <CITE>Business Week</CITE>'s expression, in a cynical abuse of the process in which it is rumored that the President himself is a major participant enjoying enormous wealth as a result of his private holdings." There is also a great inflow of foreign capital, most of it going into "short-term speculative holdings rather than into directly productive investments."

<P>In Argentina, also highly praised for its progress under World Bank tutelage, real wages dropped 30 percent since 1980, income inequality increased radically, and "the social expenditures by the public sector benefit more the upper levels of the social pyramid than the lower levels," a confidential World Bank study reported. As in Mexico, the laws of neoliberal science, still as immutable as the principles of gravitation, are functioning as they have throughout history.

<P>Among the developed societies, the top-ranking U.S. client and by far the leading recipient of U.S. aid is Israel, which also has extreme economic inequality (by First World standards). It is increasing under the neoliberal policies of the Labor government. In 1992, the number of families below the poverty line increased by over 14 percent, almost 6 percent more in 1993, now reaching about 650,000 people, 280,000 of them children. The figures include only 45 percent of Palestinian citizens, of whom over a third were below the poverty line. Uncounted also are the poor in agricultural settlements and those considered to be self-employed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.19" HREF="#FN2.19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The consistency is difficult to miss, though not to explain.

<P>Within the ideological system, it is claimed that equality and economic growth are in conflict: we choose one or the other, and our commitment to growth along the lines pioneered by our hero Adam Smith has the unfortunate consequence of engendering inequality, though all ultimately gain as wealth increases. There are a few problems with the theory. One is that equality is a significant factor contributing to growth, as is conceded even by the World Bank, despite its dedication to anti-egalitarian policies. Another is that the model that U.S. leaders have imposed abroad, and seek to duplicate as far as possible here, has led to extreme misery and impoverishment even after long "experiments" -- a rather consistent effect of the "experiments" conducted by the masters, over centuries. A third problem is that the hero at whose shrine we worship would have been appalled by the argument. A pre-capitalist thinker with roots in the Enlightenment, Smith based his argument for markets on the belief that under "perfect liberty" there would be a natural tendency towards equality, a condition for efficient market function. One can hardly say that his argument has been empirically refuted, given the extreme remoteness of "really existing capitalism" from liberty, as understood by classical liberalism.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.20" HREF="#FN2.20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A symbolic expression of the disaster for families is the fate of the International Convention on Rights of the Child, adopted by the United Nations in November 1989 and ratified by 162 countries, but not the United States -- though for fairness we should add that contemporary conservatism is catholic in its anti-child spirit. A decade ago the World Health Organization voted 118 to 1 to condemn the Nestle corporation's aggressive marketing of its infant formula in the Third World. Well aware of the likely toll in infant disease and death, the Reagan White House cast the sole negative vote, leading the way in the noble cause of free market capitalism and family values.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.21" HREF="#FN2.21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Another symbolic expression is a new line of Hallmark Greeting Cards. One, to be placed under a cereal box in the morning, reads: "Have a super day at school." Another, placed on the pillow at night, says: "I wish I were there to tuck you in." Parents aren't home, one effect of the "anti-child, anti-family spirit" engendered by double-edged "conservatism."

<P>In part, the disaster for families and children is a direct consequence of falling wages. For much of the population, both parents have to work 50-60 hours a week merely to provide necessities. And the elimination of "market rigidities" means that you work extra hours at lower wages -- or you may watch your children starve: all strictly voluntary, of course, in our free society. It doesn't take a genius to predict the consequences, and the statistics show them. Stanford University economist Victor Fuchs estimates that U.S. children have lost 10-12 hours of parental time per week between 1960 and 1986. Total contact time dropped 40 percent in the past generation, leading to deterioration of parent-child relations and family identity and values; increased reliance on TV for child supervision; "latchkey children" with rising child alcoholism, drug use, and criminality; violence by and against children; and other obvious effects on health, education, and ability to participate in a democratic society -- even survival.

<P>The conservative war against children and families is taking on a still more bitter cast with the reduction of government support for low-income housing, which declined 80 percent in real terms from 1979 to 1988, becoming "the main cause of an acute housing shortage that now stretches across the nation," Hewlett observes. The U.S. is also unusual among developed societies in not providing health care for mothers; about half of the 40,000 deaths of infants before their first birthday is attributed to lack of adequate prenatal care, more difficult to obtain today than in 1975. The U.S. "is unique in its lack of provision for childbirth," Hewlett continues, one reason why infant mortality rates are so much lower elsewhere. Rights and benefits for working parents when a child is born are also sharply restricted as compared with other rich nations. Approximately 30 percent of babies in the U.S. and 20 percent in Britain "are deprived of that precious time" that most specialists assume to be "the minimally adequate period of time for a parent to bond with a new child." Lack of job protection after childbirth is "a large part of the reason why working mothers in the United States lose from 13 to 20 per cent of their earning power after giving birth to a first child," a catastrophe for many parents in an era of falling wages, benefits, and security, and ever more onerous work demands. Day care and pre-school arrangements are also minimal by comparative standards.

<P>But things are sure to improve now that Mr. Family Values is in charge. Gingrich has not yet announced legislation to authorize state kidnapping of children of the undeserving poor for placement in orphanages, but he will "reaffirm the importance he places on family life," he said, by forming a committee that will include children and spouses of some House members "to figure out a legislative schedule more compatible with family life."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.22" HREF="#FN2.22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Some of the consequences of the war against children and families do receive a huge amount of attention, in a most enlightening way. As the 1994 election approached, major journals were lavishing attention on several new books expressing deep concern over (alleged) declines of IQ and scholastic achievement. The <CITE>New York Times</CITE> devoted an unusually long lead article in the weekly book review to several books on the topic, primarily the <CITE>The Bell Curve</CITE> by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, a book that is "being seriously compared" to Darwin's <CITE>Origin of Species,</CITE> a reviewer in <CITE>Forbes</CITE> magazine breathlessly proclaimed. The <CITE>Times</CITE> reviewer was its science writer Malcolm Browne, who opens by warning that a "government or society that persists in sweeping their subject matter under the rug will do so at its peril." There is no mention of the UNICEF study (nor have I seen one elsewhere); or of any of the numerous studies that deal with the war against children and families waged under the banner of conservatism and family values.

<P>What, then, is the question that we ignore at our peril? It turns out to be quite narrow. IQ is claimed to be genetically determined in significant measure, which will lead to a "hereditary meritocracy"; and still more ominous, linked to race, with the less intelligent breeding like rabbits and fouling the gene pool. Perhaps Black mothers don't nurture their children because they "evolved in the warm but highly unpredictable environment of Africa," the author of one of the books reviewed suggests. This is real hard science, which we ignore at our peril. But we may -- indeed must -- ignore the social policies based on free markets for the poor and state protection for the rich -- the fact, for example, that in the city where such articles appear, the richest in the world, 40 percent of children now live below the poverty line, with little hope of escape from misery and destitution. Could that have something to do with measures of IQ and achievement, or the other consequences of the war against children and families discussed in many unmentionable studies? Such questions we may readily ignore: a natural decision by the rich and powerful, addressing one another and seeking justifications for the class war they are conducting and its human effects.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.23" HREF="#FN2.23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The intensity of the effort to lend credibility to the preferred conclusions, particularly on the part of those who profess to be appalled by them, is an intriguing phenomenon. The editors of the <CITE>Times Book Review,</CITE> mostly committed liberals no doubt, selected three books on science in their annual list of "Best Books" for 1994, all devoted to a single science. The choices were so obvious that there was little dispute, they report. "The science is, broadly, evolutionary biology or specifically, sociobiology, which, once it gets into your brain, can really spook you about genetics." What "spooks you" is <I>human</I> sociobiology, not the study of complex molecules and ants, about which science actually has something to say.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.24" HREF="#FN2.24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>One choice is a memoir by Edward Wilson, "one of the founders of sociobiology" with "his seminal 1975 book `Sociobiology'" -- which has interesting material on simpler organisms, and ends with a few pages of speculations on human sociobiology. The field was actually founded 85 years earlier by the leading anarchist thinker Peter Kropotkin, also a natural scientist, in seminal work that led to his classic <CITE>Mutual Aid: a Factor of Evolution,</CITE> published in 1902. His studies criticized the conclusions on "struggle for existence" drawn by the noted Darwinian T.H. Huxley, who never responded publicly, though in private he wrote that Kropotkin's prominently-published work was "very interesting and important." Kropotkin's Darwinian speculations about the possible role of cooperation in evolution, with their implications for anarchist social organization, remain about as solid a contribution to human sociobiology as exists today. But somehow this work has not entered "the canon"; one can hardly imagine why.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.25" HREF="#FN2.25">25</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The editors' second choice is Robert Wright's <CITE>Moral Animal,</CITE> which relies on "the science of evolutionary psychology" in an effort to show that "the source of human morality is genetic." The general thesis is sure to shock anyone who thought that humans are indistinguishable from rocks and birds. Specific versions of the thesis could be interesting and important, though what evolutionary psychology has to say of any substance would hardly "spook" any rational reader.

<P>The most illuminating of the choices of the editors is the one they list first: Steven Pinker's <CITE>Language Instinct,</CITE> "which seems to doom the liberal notion that human behavior can be made better by improvements in culture and environment," a frightening conclusion indeed. What exactly is it that "dooms the liberal notion" that culture and environment influence behavior? The book reviews evidence supporting the thesis that the capacity for human language appears to be a species-property in essentials, surprisingly independent of other cognitive abilities, and a common human possession over a very broad range. As for the use of these apparently common human abilities, nothing is known beyond environmental factors (you speak English or Japanese, etc.). It is hardly in doubt that such factors also lead to striking differences in ability to make use of the abilities with which we are genetically endowed, though again, it would surprise no sane person if some genetic factor were discovered that has a detectable effect in distinguishing me from a poet -- or violinist, or quantum physicist, or auto mechanic, or anyone with skills I lack. How the editors draw their conclusions from work that offers them no particle of support, indeed undermines them to the extent that anything is understood, they unfortunately do not tell us.

<P>Also intriguing is the way the editors seek to buttress their imaginative constructions. The book, they say, "gathers data from many fields -- including cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology and speech therapy -- to demonstrate that the roots of language are in our genes," which again will come as a great shock to everyone who thought that humans were indistinguishable from rocks and birds. The author places this conclusion "firmly...in the framework of Darwinian natural selection," which has nothing to say about the topic: simply try to draw some conclusion about language from the theory. The other subjects mentioned, particularly developmental psychology, do make a contribution, but the evidence comes overwhelmingly from linguistics, as the book makes clear. That, however, lacks the proper panache for the ideological purposes at hand.

<P>It's hardly necessary to review once again the misrepresentation and elementary fallacies in the work on IQ that we ignore "at our peril," exposed years ago when the game became popular and now repackaged for today's purposes -- always eliciting much praise for the courage of the authors in lining up with the powerful and "breaking the censorship" imposed by the radical extremists who run the universities and the press. Even if we grant every factual conclusion for which some shred of evidence is claimed, nothing of interest follows, except on assumptions that reflect ideological fanaticism, not science. Specifically, the topic of "meritocracy" is not even addressed unless we grant the tacit assumption that there is something "meritorious" about the particular array of traits, perhaps partially inherited (though nothing relevant is known), that confer power and prestige under particular social arrangements: in some societies, a penchant for torture and murder; in ours, some combination of greed, cynicism, obsequiousness and subordination, lack of curiosity and independence of mind, self-serving disregard for others, and who knows what else, as reflected quite vividly by income distributions and the contributions to society at the high end.

<P>These trivialities aside, one striking finding of the studies reviewed is how poorly IQ correlates with socioeconomic status, possibly a consequence of the fact that it is designed to measure academic success, which is probably correlated only weakly with whatever it is that leads to wealth and privilege under the particular conditions of state capitalist society. If the real factors were studied, possibly better measures could be designed.

<P>One conclusion drawn is that IQ is heritable; according to <CITE>Bell Curve</CITE> author Charles Murray, 60% heritable, which means that "60 percent of the I.Q. in any given person" is "heritable." Murray's statement is meaningless, but presumably he is intending to convey the idea that 60 percent of the I.Q. of a particular individual is determined by the genes. Many others have drawn the same conclusion, based on an elementary error that has been repeatedly pointed out, among others, by Robert Wright. He correctly observes that a trait can be highly heritable whatever its genetic component; say, 100% heritable with no genetic component (whatever that means exactly; it is not a clear notion of biology). To borrow an example from Ned Block, "some years ago when only women wore earrings, the heritability of having an earring was high because differences in whether a person had an earring was due to a chromosomal difference, XX vs. XY." No one has yet suggested that wearing earrings, or ties, is "in our genes," an inescapable fate that environment cannot influence, "dooming the liberal notion."

<P>The case for group differences is no stronger, not that it would matter in a non-racist society were it true. Take the famous 15 percent deficiency in Black I.Q., which results from some interaction of genetic endowment and environment. About genetic factors that might conceivably be involved, science knows nothing. About environments, a good bit is known, in particular, about the effects of adverse and supportive environments, from the pre-natal stage on. In the absence of any relevant information about unknown genetic factors, or any serious way to measure how such factors (were they to exist, and become known) might interact with environmental conditions, the evidence presented in the <CITE>Bell Curve</CITE> is entirely compatible with the conclusion that IQs of Blacks are 15 points higher than those of Whites, or any other number one prefers on ideological grounds. Furthermore, still accepting all the factual claims, nothing follows about long-term social tendencies unless we assume that the natural state of a person is to vegetate, unless driven by transmittable material reward.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.26" HREF="#FN2.26">26</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As for Malcolm Browne's great fears, they are readily alleviated. Suppose again we grant the most ominous facts he conjures up about decline of IQ and achievement, and its causes. There's an easy solution to the problem: simply bring here millions of peasants driven from the countryside in China under the "reforms," and radically reduce Browne's income and that of his friends and associates, making sure to deprive their daughters of opportunities and education, while Black mothers are placed in Manhattan high rises and granted every advantage. Then the Asian influx will raise the IQ level; and as serious inquiry demonstrates, the fertility rate of Blacks is very likely to drop while that of the children of the journalistic elite, Harvard psychology professors, and associates of the American Enterprise Institute will rapidly rise. The problem is solved; there is nothing to fear.

<P>In part I of this series, last month, I quoted two medical researchers on the well-known fact that "development of the brain is strongly influenced by the quality of the nourishment and nurturance given to infants and children," among other effects of "adverse environments" early in life that can lead "to permanent defects in memory and learning." The scale and character of such effects is scarcely understood, but there are all too many illustrations. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FA0) predicts that "Nicaragua's next generation will be smaller, weaker, and less intelligent than today's population," Oxfam reports. Is that a sudden genetic malady? Or the effects of policies designed by people at the peak of the income distribution, exercising the high intellectual and moral standards of the "meritocracy"? Those too are questions that we may readily ignore.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.27" HREF="#FN2.27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The only interesting question about the fascination with these topics is what function it serves, a question that is -- again -- not to hard to answer.

<P>These are some of the uglier forms of population control. In the more benign variant, the rabble are to be diverted into harmless pursuits by the huge propaganda institutions, half-American, which spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year to convert people into atoms of consumption and obedient tools of production (when they are lucky enough to find work) -- isolated from one another, lacking even a conception of what a decent human life might be. That's important. Normal human sentiments have to be crushed; they are inconsistent with an ideology geared to the needs of privilege and power, which celebrates private profit as the supreme human value, demands that all submit to "economic laws," except for the wealthy, who merit special protection and care from the powerful state that they control -- a truism to Adam Smith, a "Marxist obscenity" in the intellectual world concocted by the self-styled "cognitive elite" today.

<P>I'll return in the next installment to more general commentary on background for the rollback crusade, its prospects, and the internal problems it faces.

<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> April 1995

<A NAME="SEC3.1"><H3>1. The virtual collapse of civil society</H3></A>

<P>In sections I and II (Jan., Feb.), I reviewed the latest phase of the assault on democracy and human rights that has been been gaining force for some 20 years, entering a new phase with the congressional elections of November 1994. This "landslide victory for conservatism" is supposed to have afforded Newt Gingrich's army an overwhelming "popular mandate" for the programs of their Contract with America. The mandate reached 17% of eligible voters. In the decisive House vote, 1/3 of the electorate took part, a bare majority voting for Republicans (51.3% of actual voters). The opinion profiles of the 2/3 who stayed away are virtually indistinguishable from those of Democratic voters on major issues. Only a quarter of the population had heard of the Contract a month after the election, rising to 45% after four months of intensive post-election coverage. By then, 55% had an opinion about the Commander-in-Chief of the victorious army; of those, 22% had a favorable opinion, less than half the approval for the much-disliked President, though his ratings increased through February as the highly unpopular Contract was being implemented.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.1" HREF="#FN3.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Nonetheless, fabricated landslides and mandates aside, there is no doubt that the assault against democracy and rights has accelerated, in ways that are significant and ominous. And one cannot take too much comfort from the radical opposition between attitudes and policies. The facts are known only to those who read the small print, and an impression of overwhelming support is being conveyed. The effects will be to change individual attitudes that receive no social support; few want to stand "alone against the popular will." With the virtual collapse of civil socity and the lack of a significant organized counterforce, the "mandate" that is fabrication today is likely to be reality tomorrow. 

<P>In announcing the Clinton Doctrine in late 1993, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake borrowed some standard Cold War terminology, announcing a transition from <I>containment</I> of the "global threat to market democracies" to <I>enlargement</I> of "their reach." The Cold War term for enlargement was <I>rollback,</I> official policy from 1950. The new doctrine, then, continues the old. Throughout the Cold War, the domestic populations of the industrial societies, including the United States, were a prime target for "containment." The doctrinal framework does correspond to historical reality, but only under familiar translations. "Democracy" is to contained, restricted to "top-down forms" that keep "traditional structures of power" intact at home and abroad, as the more candid acknowledge. Politics must remain "the shadow cast on society by big business," to borrow John Dewey's formulation of Adam Smith's truisms about "the principal architects of policy." As for "markets," what will be "enlarged" is the traditional double-edged doctrine: market discipline for the poor and weak, state protection and intervention (in the economy, and the world) for the benefit of those who cast the shadow -- "the masters of mankind," in Smith's phrase.

<P>Restating the Doctrine without equivocation, the masters have long sought to <I>contain</I> popular struggles to expand the range of meaningful democracy and human rights, but now perceive that they can do better. They feel, perhaps rightly, that they can dismantle the social contract that has been in some measure achieved, rolling back the threat posed by the "great beast" that keeps trying "to plunder the rich" (Alexander Hamilton and John Foster Dulles, speaking for a host of others). The architects of policy can move on to establish a utopia of the masters based on the values of greed and power, in which privilege is enhanced by state power and the general population lack rights apart from what they can salvage on a (highly flexible) labor market. They are also free to starve or to enter the rapidly expanding workhouse prisons.


<A NAME="SEC3.2"><H3>"Tough Love"</H3></A>

<P>The <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE>'s review of economic performance for the last quarter of 1995 is headlined: "Companies' Profits Surged 61% on Higher Prices, Cost Cuts." After-tax profits rose 62% from 1993, up from 34% for the third quarter. In a full-page ad, a leading lender, the CIT Group, announced proudly that "Corporate America Posted Record Profits In 1994." The headline in <CITE>Business Week</CITE> read: "It Doesn't Get a Lot Better than This." Its survey estimated profits to be up "an enormous 41% over [1993]," despite a bare 9% increase in sales, a "colossal success," resulting in large part from a "sharp" drop in the "share going to labor," though "economists say labor will benefit -- eventually." The masters aren't fooled.

<P>1993 had been a banner year for business with "dazzling" profits for the <CITE>Fortune</CITE> 500 despite stagnant sales growth. 1994 was a great improvement, yielding "surging profits" that were "overflowing the coffers of Corporate America," <CITE>Business Week</CITE> exulted even before the grand news about the final quarter was in. Meanwhile median wages and work conditions continued their steady decline. The number of children under 6 living in poverty reached a record high of 6 million, 26 percent of that age group, an increase of 1 million from 1987 to 1992 and almost double the figures for 1972 when the rollback crusade was in its early stages.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.2" HREF="#FN3.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It therefore follows as night follows day that social policies must be modified to enrich the suffering masses of Corporate America still further while the rest are taught stern lessons about the rigors of this "lean and mean" age. And so we see day-by-day as the story unfolds.

<P>The President's first response was to increase the Pentagon budget, the leading form of welfare for the rich. Unaware of the "mandate" it has conferred, the public is strongly opposed. Military spending is "near the bottom of the public's wish list," <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> polling director Richard Morin observes, with only 1/6 favoring an increase (in contrast, about 2/3 favored more spending on education, drug addiction programs, the environment, and other social spending which is to be sharply cut). In real dollars, the Pentagon budget is $30 billion a year higher than under Nixon, at about 85% of the Cold War average. The Cold War enemy is, of course, now an ally, even in military production: thus its advanced research programs enabled the U.S. to regain the world lead in pulsed power and microwave weaponry, the prestigious military journal <CITE>Jane's Defence Weekly</CITE> reported in January. The figures give some indication of how large "the threat to market democracy" posed by the Great Satan loomed in the eyes of planners who sought to "contain" it and "roll it back."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.3" HREF="#FN3.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Republican majority in Congress was not satisfied with this radical opposition to the public will, particularly the Speaker of the House, who represents the Lockheed Corporation and other high tech industries and has had unparalleled success in using the federal government to transfer public funds to his wealthy constituents. Under his leadership, the House approved a $3.2 billion "emergency" supplement for the starving Pentagon. The funds are to be drawn from programs for the vast majority. In a vain and pallid gesture that highlights what is at issue, House Democrats proposed in committee to replace a planned $5-$7 billion of cuts in child nutrition, housing, and job training by a five-year delay in deployment of Lockheed F-22 advanced fighters, a welfare program now estimated at $72 billion. The suggestion was summarily rejected, and scarcely reported.

<P>The word to use remains "security," not "subsidy," as Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington advised in the early days of the Cold War, when government was being mobilized as the "savior" of private power, which could not survive in a competitive economy, as the business press frankly acknowledged. And once again, current plans for "defense" are designed so as to foster security threats. A minor one is the Soviet Union; though now an ally, it remains a potential threat to U.S. "preponderance," the currently fashionable term for global rule. But the primary threat is "Third World weapons proliferation," Air Force Director of Science and Technology General Richard Paul informed <CITE>Jane's.</CITE> We must maintain military spending and strengthen the "defense industrial base" because of "the growing technological sophistication of Third World conflicts," the Bush Administration had explained to Congress while watching the Berlin Wall collapse, taking with it the most efficient pretext for "subsidy." No one who has kept their eyes on the "security system" will be surprised to learn that both threats are to be enhanced.

<P>Some of the funding for the emergency Pentagon supplement is to be drawn from programs to help dismantle and safeguard the nuclear arsenals of the former USSR. To protect ourselves from the resulting threat, we will have to "increase the Defense Department's budget," Florida Democratic Representative Pete Peterson commented. Furthermore, "Third World weapons proliferation" is to be stimulated, with new contributions to its "growing technological sophistication." The U.S. share in arms sales to Third World countries has reached almost three-quarters. We must therefore provide them with even more advanced weaponry, so that we can tremble in proper fear. Sale of F-16 aircraft with taxpayer-subzidized loans allows the Air Force to pay Lockheed to upgrade the aircraft and to develop the F-22 to counter the threat they pose. The welfare programs extend beyond Gingrich country, General Paul emphasized, outlining the commitment "to spin dual-use [Science & Technology] outside the military" in "the national interest," "enhancing our economic security." Particularly "enhanced" is the welfare of corporate America, which is to "transition our work," General Paul continued in standard bureaucratese.

<P>Gingrich's favorite cash cow understands the scam perfectly. Lockheed propaganda warns that it is a "dangerous world" in which "sophisticated fighter airplanes and air defense systems are being sold" -- mostly by its "savior." One of the authors adds: "We've sold the F-16 all over the world; what if [a friend or ally] turns against us?" To fend off that threat, we have to sell potential adversaries still more advanced weapons, and to transfer still more public funds to the shrinking sectors of the population that bear the burden of "dazzling" profits. Quite simple, really.

<P>Arms sales to undemocratic countries -- virtually all the recipients -- are opposed by a mere 96 percent of the population, so these programs reflect the "popular mandate" even better than their companions.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.4" HREF="#FN3.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The National Security State is a natural favorite of the advocates of private tyrannies. The device facilitates the transfer of public funds to advanced industry and to wealthy sectors generally, with the public cowering in fear of foreign enemies so that planners can operate in "technocratic insulation," in World Bank lingo. Furthermore, the "great beast" has to be dealt with somehow, and the natural device is to frighten them. With internal enemies as well; it is only reasonable that the directors of the Contract should expand further the domestic security system organized and conducted by the powerful state they wish to nurture, passing legislation permitting warrantless searches (considered a "bad idea" by 69% of those who conferred "the mandate").<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.5" HREF="#FN3.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>While the important people are receiving the care they deserve from their nanny state, social programs are being radically cut. Here the word to use is not "security," but "welfare dependence." The poor are to be helped to escape this grim fate, imposed upon them by a failed liberalism. The only problem with the story is the facts. As discussed in earlier articles, official "welfare" has sharply declined. The average monthly benefit level dropped from $714 in 1970 to $510 in 1980 and $394 in 1993 (1995 dollars), Marc Breslow observes. The one exception is health care for the poor (Medicaid), which has risen (though more slowly than general health care costs) in large part as a result of the gross inefficiencies of the privatized system with its huge administrative and bureaucratic burdens, public funding of profits, salaries, and advertising, and now micromanagement of doctors to ensure minimal care and transfer of choice from doctor and patient to fat cats in insurance company offices.

<P>The correlation between welfare payments and family life is real, though it is the reverse of what is claimed. As support for the poor has declined, unwed birthrates, which had risen steadily from the 1940s through the mid-1970s, markedly increased. "Over the last three decades, the rate of poverty among children almost perfectly correlates with the birthrates among teenage mothers a decade later," Mike Males points out: "That is, child poverty seems to lead to teenage childbearing, not the other way around." As discussed in part II of this series, the dramatic impact of the war against children and families by Reagan-Thatcher "conservatives" has been well studied, but equally well concealed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.6" HREF="#FN3.6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Facts are irrelevant when there is serious business at hand: right now, intensified class war. Among the programs targeted for elimination or radical reduction are school lunches, job training, education generally, assistance to homeless and veterans, fuel and health care for the needy, drug-free schools, conversion of military industry to human needs -- and generally, anything that might help the undeserving majority. That's doubtless in response to the fact that about 80% of the population think "government has a responsibility to try to do away with poverty," up from 70% when the "great society" programs were initiated 30 years ago, to enter into sharp decline shortly after.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.7" HREF="#FN3.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Representative Clay Shaw, Chair of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, explained that the proposals to punish millions of poor children are really "tough love," a compassionate effort to save them from dependence on the dole. The programs do not pass without criticism. <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reporter David Rosenbaum observes that "however worthy the goals and however sensible the principles" that inspire "tough love," these efforts to raise up the poor and needy face "seemingly intractable contradictions" -- primarily impediments of the kind just reviewed, which remain unmentioned.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.8" HREF="#FN3.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Jingoism is also in style. Clinton agrees that the U.S. must lower its share of UN peacekeeping operations but his right-wing adversaries want to go much further, shackling or even ending them. As for the irrelevant public, well over 80% favor UN peacekeeping operations. Half consistently support U.S. participation, 88% if there are fair prospects of success; 5-10% consistently oppose such operations, the remainder varying with circumstances. The effect of fatalities in Somalia was slight. Asked their general reaction if dead American soldiers were shown on TV, 57% favored increasing U.S. forces or striking back. Two-thirds favored contributing U.S. troops to a UN operation to protect "safe havens" or to stop atrocities in Bosnia; 80% took the same position with regard to Rwanda, if the UN concluded that genocide was underway.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.9" HREF="#FN3.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Along with "security" and "welfare dependence," the magic words include "devolution" and "states' rights." Programs that might help people are not only to be cut, but also handed over to the states in block grants. Under conditions of relative equality, this could be a move towards democracy. Under existing circumstances, devolution is intended as a further blow to the eroding democratic processes. Major corporations, investment firms, and the like, can constrain or directly control the acts of national governments and can set one national work force against another. But the game is much easier when the only competing player that might remotely be influenced by the "great beast" is a state government, and even middle-sized enterprise can join in. The shadow cast by business can thus be far darker, and private power can move on to greater victories in the name of freedom; another triviality that appears unworthy of comment.

<P>The Way it Works is described in a lead article in the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> business section headed "Line grows longer for state aid," putting the "business-friendly administration" of Gov. William Weld "in a bind." Private enterprises ranging from big-timers like Raytheon, long dependent on the public dole, to sports teams, banks, financial services and insurers, and others, are threatening to move elsewhere unless they receive "big wage and benefit concessions" from unions and millions of dollars worth of gifts disguised as "breaks on taxes and utility bills." An accompanying story describes how the truly powerful operate. It reports Microsoft magnate Bill Gates's boast that he had delivered an ultimatum to Vice-President Gore warning that he would move the whole operation elsewhere unless Washington settled an anti-trust suit in his favor.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.10" HREF="#FN3.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The richest city in the world, with the help of the state government, hopes to lead the pack. New York Governor Pataki announced a budget plan that will "reduce the top tax rate 25 percent and save taxpayers $6.8 billion a year," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reported. The first part is true, particularly for the rich; for families with incomes over $150,000, the tax reduction is seven times as high as for those with incomes under $25,000. But the "savings for the taxpayer" are a mirage. One such "saving" is a cut of $128 million next year in appropriations for the metropolitan area public transit system, tacked on to a $113 million cut in city financing. These "savings" will make a 25-cent to 50-cent increase in the already ridiculously high fares "virtually inevitable," transit advocates estimate -- "a tax hike for the more than four million moderate-income and working people" of the city, they add correctly, and a huge and radically regressive one. Among other effects, the "savings" remove fare reductions for schoolchildren, yet another regressive tax.

<P>Further "savings to the taxpayer" include reduction of support and health care for the blind and disabled, children, and defenseless people generally; firing workers who merely provide services to the general public; sharp increases in tuition at city and state universities; cancellation or delay of desperately needed infrastructure repair; doubling up of prisoners in maximum security prisons; and elimination or sharp reduction of the meager assistance to pregnant women on welfare, home care services for the elderly and disabled, pensions, cleanup of Love Canal, assistance for single adults with children "considered employable" -- perhaps in the satanic mills that are springing up throughout the city; and on, and on. It will be "a giant leap toward economic growth," the president of the Business Council of New York State exulted, perhaps thinking of those great Caribbean vacations and evenings at luxury restaurants and the theater (deductible as business expenses) and other opportunities that will be afforded by the huge redistribution programs towards the needy rich in a city that has already surpassed Guatemala in the inequality derby.

<P>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani lost no time in showing that he too knows how to serve the powerful. "Embracing the philosophy of Gov. George E. Pataki's austere budget for the state," the <CITE>Times</CITE> reported, the Mayor will "reduce for the first time public assistance and health care for the city's poorest residents" and "restructure government in ways that would affect virtually every New Yorker, although not evenly" -- a masterpiece of understatement. "In addition to the [general] cuts in welfare and health care," the Mayor called on workers to agree to "savings" in "health care, pensions and work rules." Sanitation services are a prime target. They don't benefit the folks in the high rises, and the effects should not be too much of an annoyance as their limousines pass by decaying trash and rotting people. Also to be cut are assistance to foster parents and preventive services for families considered to pose risks of child abuse. That makes good sense as a component of the war against children and families that has been waged with unremitting intensity by the "family value" conservatives in the past 15 years.

<P>In these lean and mean times, it would be unfair to target only the general population. Hence along with sharp reduction of programs that might benefit the general population, there will also be reduction in "property taxes on coops and condos, as well as reductions in business taxes" -- so everyone shares in the suffering. Municipal hospitals and health services will close, and public education will deteriorate still further, all "to stimulate job growth," the report continues with a straight face.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.11" HREF="#FN3.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>For unexplained reasons, the rising tax burden on poor and working people through fare increases and other regressive measures, though plainly reducing their purchases of goods, does not affect the jobs of those who might otherwise produce them. In contrast, job growth is stimulated by transfer of wealth to the rich for purchase of Mercedes limousines and elegant yachts, rich profits from speculation in the "economic miracle" of the Mexican economy (secured by the taxpayer, when it predictably goes sour), shifting of production to semi-slave economies maintained by U.S.-backed violence abroad, and other such free market miracles. The mysteries of economic science are profound indeed.

<P>Not all programs are to be axed, however. One public agency is to receive more money under the Giuliani budget: the police department, which will gain $100 million. That too makes sense, as part of the general enhancement of state power and violence. The rich have to be protected from the effects of the programs to turn New York into a typical Third World city.

<P>At the federal level, some programs are also safeguarded. Over three-fourths of federal food spending goes for food stamps, and that program is slated to keep federal guarantees, for reasons explained quietly by the <CITE>Wall St. Journal</CITE>: the food stamp program is backed by "big agri-business associations," so there is no place for "tough love" here. "We want one program at least to be a safety net for people who are truly needy," Rep. Pat Roberts of Kansas explained as the House Agriculture Committee that he chairs decided to impose federal requirements for the food stamp program. "That's the best way to achieve our goals of providing nutrition for the hungry and eliminating fraud from the program," Roberts continued. "It is a more pragmatic approach to achieve several of our goals." Republicans were "uneasy" about block grants that would "give governors cash rather than give poor people coupons for food," the <CITE>Journal,</CITE> noting that "grocery chains and the agribusiness lobby" were also "uneasy." Federal guarantees, in this case, will best preserve "a safety net for needy people." The reason for the decision, <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reporter Robert Pear added, is that House Republicans "feared that it would increase fraud and abuse" if governors were given grants, in this single case. Surely nothing else could have been on their minds -- for example, the fact that Roberts's congressional district received more farm subsidies over the last decade than any other, over $.5 billion a year, with Kansas farmers averaging $20,000 to $30,000 annually. Those are <I>averages</I>; the "agri-business associations" mentioned in the small print do not represent small farmers trying to scrape by. The likely outcome will put limits on the program so that it cannot meet the needs of the hungry during periods of economic decline but will offer steady guarantees to agri-business, and leave discretion in the hands of states, so that local powers can determine who are the "worthy poor" -- not including mothers who merely care for children, refusing to "work."

<P>Much as in totalitarian states, satirists are given greater latitude to articulate what everyone knows. In the <CITE>Boston Globe,</CITE> the text of a Steve Wasserman cartoon reads: "We planned to eliminate food stamps, but then we took pity. We couldn't bear the hungry cries, the outstretched hands of agribusiness lobbyists."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.12" HREF="#FN3.12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>One must admire the delicate touch of the statist reactionaries fine-tuning the transfer programs. Unlike food stamps, the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program is to be turned over to states as block grants. One reason is again explained by the <CITE>Wall Street Journal.</CITE> This transfer repeals a "cost-containment competitive bidding measure" that placed onerous market conditions on the four pharmaceutical companies that sell infant formula. They "stand to gain as much as a billion dollars" a year over and above the successes of their evasions of the federal law, now being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission. Note that taxpayers will save money with the FTC investigation terminated. The new protection for the rich from market discipline should overcome other defects of the WIC program. A USDA study found that every dollar spent brought up to $3.90 reduction of Medicaid costs for newborns and mothers. It also found a 22% drop in neonatal deaths among WIC participants. The effects of restriction of the program and transfer of its benefits to pharmaceutical companies are obvious without comment, among them, the mental and physical harm to surviving children of low-income pregnant women deprived of sustenance, which will improve the grim bell curve that condemns all but the "cognitive elite" to servitude, as yet another "science" shows.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.13" HREF="#FN3.13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Malnourished neonates and children deprived even of school lunches have no lobby working for them. Nor do the great majority of the population. Over 80 percent of the population say that "working people" have too little influence, but the shadow cast by business ensures that they can do nothing about it except watch in dismay and unfocused anger as they sink into decline. Unlike the peasants and slum-dwellers of Haiti, who were able to create a civil society rich and vibrant enough to establish a functioning democracy, people here are lost and hopeless -- a fact that sheds light on the standard propaganda line that we have to teach democracy to Haitians. But although 80% feel that working people have too little influence, only 20% feel that way about labor unions while twice that number feel that unions have too much influence. These figures reflect yet another remarkable victory for corporate propaganda.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.14" HREF="#FN3.14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The human consequences of the "savings" are immediate. Take elimination of home heating aid for the poor, which had reached over 5 million households. 72% have incomes below $8000 and spend over 18% of that on energy costs (4% for average middle-class families). Even with federal aid, half the families had used up the allocation before Christmas in 1993, and by mid-January, twice as many had died from the cold wave as in the Los Angeles earthquake. Boston City Hospital researchers found that among children treated in the emergency room (the "national health service" for the poor), the percentage suffering malnutrition almost doubled in the winter. The new measures will not only harm or kill more children, but are also a useful blow to communities. The oil vendors working with the program were mostly small businesses, often multilingual community people. So the threat of democracy is rolled back another notch.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.15" HREF="#FN3.15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Another target is public broadcasting, financially trivial but an important part of the campaign to mobilize some public support by a show of "populism" on the part of those who are happily grinding the public under foot. The propaganda campaign to depict the public system as "liberal" and "elitist" is familiar. It is unclear whether it has had much effect. A recent poll finds that over 3/4 of the population want to keep the limited public funding. But the idea that any element of the information system might remain within a potentially democratic system has always been galling to the totalitarian mentality, so despite its marginality, it may disappear.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.16" HREF="#FN3.16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Also slated for demolition is the regulatory apparatus, which only protects health, safety, welfare, and lives -- now and for future generations. The measures proposed carry more immediate costs: "at least $250 million annually" to enforce the complex provisions, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, largely to pay more bureaucrats. Clinton is joining the parade. His plans to rescind legislation that prevented banks from relying on federally-guaranteed funds for speculation were wonderfully timed. This proposal for "eliminating the legal and regulatory barriers among financial industries" was announced in a front-page <CITE>New York Times</CITE> story alongside the news that even the strict regulatory system of quasi-fascist Singapore had collapsed, destroying Britain's most venerable merchant bank -- a coincidence that is "ironic," the lobbyist for smaller banks observed. These measures are also expected to concentrate extraordinary resources in a small number of super-powerful banks and investment firms, another contribution to "free markets." The Barings collapse is just another in a series of recent disasters, including Kidder Peabody, Orange County, Procter & Gamble, Metallgeschaft, and Mexican casino capitalism. The costs will be paid by the usual victims.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.17" HREF="#FN3.17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It hasn't been easy for commentators to deal with recent developments. One problem has been to reconcile the concept of a "popular mandate" with the unmistakeable fact that the public strenuously opposes it almost every step of the way, and to preserve the doctrine that Congress, like the White House, is dedicated to serving the public good. Richard Berke's February 28 <CITE>New York Times</CITE> report, already cited, concedes that the public "doubts key parts of the G.O.P.'s agenda," giving (very partial) evidence, but explains that Congress implements the programs that the public despises "based on their reading of public sentiment." Congress has failed to notice what the polls have consistently demonstrated. The doctrinal system permits accusations of imbecility, but not of rational service to dominant powers. Adam Smith's honesty would be damned as a "conspiracy theory," were anyone so bold as to reiterate it.

<P>Some keep trying to conceal the obvious. Thus we find articles with such headlines as "Poll finds GOP agenda is popular," reporting that only 40% of Americans have even heard of the Contract with America and scarcely a third "approve of Gingrich's performance." But, the report in the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> continues, some components of the program are "overwhelmingly popular," specifically term limits for Congress, a balanced budget amendment, and welfare reform. Unmentioned is the fact that term limits were quickly shelved; advocacy of a balanced budget declines to small minorities if it entails cuts in social programs, as of course it does; and while the public does oppose "welfare," having been fed wild tales about "welfare queens," it strongly supports increased help for the poor.

<P>Sometimes the facts even appear in stories framed to confirm the official line. A lead front-page story in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> in mid-December informs us that "Americans Like G.O.P. Agenda." Reading on, we find data, which show quite the opposite: about 2/3 "say the Government has a responsibility to take care of the poor" while a mere 9% support a decrease in "programs for poor children," one of the major planks of the "G.O.P. Agenda." On the balanced budget, which is alleged to have overwhelming popular backing, the polls showed that the percentages were 22%, 27%, 30% if cuts are required in spending on education, Medicare, and Social Security, respectively -- as they would of course be. In brief, Americans Dislike G.O.P. Agenda." The real world, however, quickly disappeared. By the time the balanced budget amendment hit the front pages in late February, the issue had been reduced by government-media fiat to social security, with the crucial issue of general social spending and popular feelings about the matter completely suppressed in favor of meaningless claims that the public favors the amendment (if nothing is touched). The <CITE>Times</CITE> correspondent responsible for analysis of the issue, David Rosenbaum, rails about the "nonsense" produced by the politicians who are avoiding "substance," and proceeds to avoid the substance entirely, allowing himself only a mention of military spending and social security. Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry explains how hard it was for him to vote against the amendment "when 80% of the population are saying `Do something'": namely, don't pass an amendment that will require cuts in soical spending. Without any counterforce to the manufacture of consent, however, image will become reality, and the Republicans should to be able to use the overwhelming public opposition to their actual stand on this issue as a powerful propaganda weapon.

<P>Point-by-point, large majorities oppose specific programs that are being implemented, with rare (and interesting) exceptions. One can only speculate as to how people would react were they to read small items in the <CITE>Wall St. Journal</CITE> spelling out the consequences of the GOP "vow to ease the burden of estate and gift taxes, which they say are especially onerous for small businesses and family farms" -- and which the top tax official of the Treasury Department calculates will cut over $20 billion in tax receipts in ten years, benefitting about half of 1% of estates -- the richest.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.18" HREF="#FN3.18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The problems of reconciling fact with doctrine arise in the international arena as well. It was well-nigh impossible to conceal the fact that the highly-touted Mexican "economic miracle" on which the NAFTA propaganda campaign was founded was utter fraud, as was well-known to anyone with even a casual interest in the topic. Recall that this was the "prize example" of the miracle of the market according to the World Bank and IMF, the economics profession, the elite media, and other experts. Also difficult to handle is the fact that the U.S. taxpayer is assigned the responsibility of paying off speculators making a mint on the highly risky fraud; they are not expected to pay the costs under "free enterprise" any more than their S&L colleagues. To steer through this maze takes some ingenuity. Thus under the headline "Socializing Risk to Foster Free Markets," <CITE>New York Times</CITE> thinker Paul Lewis recognizes that the circumstances might lead some "to be cynical about a mechanism that would effectively provide insurance" for the rich in case things go wrong, but a more serious look shows that if Mexico had defaulted, the crisis "might have undermined the free-market-based development model that has become this decade's economic signature tune" -- for the commissar class, at least. In fact, both the Mexican "miracle" for speculators, investors, and a few billionaires milking public resources, and the way the risks were "socialized," are typical examples of "really existing free markets."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.19" HREF="#FN3.19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<A NAME="SEC4.1"><H3>Towards a Utopia of the Masters</H3></A>

<P>The economic crisis for the general population is a global one. In the past 20 years, economic growth has fallen well below the levels of the 1950s and 1960s (which were, to be sure, historically unique). World per capita income fell in 1993 for the fourth straight year, while the unemployment situation, already grim, worsened in most countries. The International Labor Organization (ILO), in its World Employment 1995 report, "Predicts Rising Global Joblessness," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reports, noting however that "many management theorists" regard the analysis as outdated because "the whole concept of a job -- steady work at steady pay from the same employer -- must be discarded." The only major exception to the growing catastrophe of global capitalism is East and Southeast Asia, with the exception of the Philippines -- incidentally, the sole part of the fastest growing economic region of the world that has been under tight U.S. control for a century and (coincidentally) resembles the Latin American disaster area.

<P>Japan's former colonies have resumed the rapid economic growth of the colonial period; though a brutal imperial power, Japan treated its colonies quite differently from the Western norm. Within the region dominated by Japan and the overseas Chinese financial network, states have been powerful enough to organize capital as well as to control labor. Unlike the rest of the South, they have not been encumbered by what economic historian Paul Bairoch calls the most extraordinary myth of "economic science": "It is difficult to find another case where the facts so contradict a dominant theory than the one concerning the negative impact of protectionism," he writes, reviewing much of the record though considerably understating the significance of state intervention for the wealthy, because he limits himself to a narrow category of market interferences. The conclusions, of course, have been understood by the architects of policy, which is why they have progressed while those subjected to their whims have suffered.

<P>The official tale is that the Japan-based region is passionately dedicated to markets. We even read that "talk of labor standards enrages many export-oriented countries in Asia"; the term "countries" here refers, for example, to the brutal and corrupt rulers in Indonesia's developmental state, but not to the working people courageously struggling for the right to organize and demanding labor standards. In internal discussion, we find greater honesty. Thus a Federal Reserve report attributes Singapore's economic growth to a domestic "forced savings" policy and other state action.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.1" HREF="#FN4.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Unemployment remains higher in Europe than in the U.S., but as the ILO and others observe, that fact has to be placed in the context of the much harsher conditions of work in the United States and the reduced social contract generally. While the U.S. work week is reaching postwar peaks, the battle for a 40-hour week having been lost long ago, in Europe it has fallen to 38-39 hours, with much longer holidays and leaves and more benefits. To take just one case, until 1993 the U.S. was one of the very few countries in the world that did not provide for statutory maternity leave, and its provisions still fall far below the European standard -- in fact below the agreement negotiated by plantation workers in <I>Uganda,</I> which grants male workers seven days of paternal leave. The same picture is revealed by ratification of ILO conventions guaranteeing labor rights. The U.S. has by far the worst record in the Western hemisphere and Europe, with the exception of El Salvador and Lithuania. It does not recognize even standard conventions on child labor and the right to organize.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.2" HREF="#FN4.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The major factors that have led to the global economic crisis are well understood. One is the globalization of production, which has offered the masters tantalizing opportunities. The business press frankly warns the "pampered Western workers" that they must abandon their "luxurious life styles" and such "market rigidities" as contracts, pensions, health and safety in the workplace, and other outdated nonsense, even the very concept of a job. Economists talk of job flow, pointing out that it is hard to estimate -- and also largely beside the point. The <I>threat</I> suffices to force working people to accept employers' demands. The end of the Cold War, returning most of Eastern Europe to its traditional Third World service role, places new weapons in the hands of the rulers, as the business press has reported with unrestrained glee. GM and VW can shift production to the restored Third world in the East, where they can find workers at a fraction of the cost of the "pampered Western workers," meanwhile enjoying high tariff protection and the other amenities that "really existing free markets" provide for the rich. The U.S. and U.K. are leading the way in grinding down working people and the poor, but others will follow along, thanks to the globalization of production. Inequality is back to the depression days in the U.S., back to Victorian times in England, though Latin America still wins the prize for worst record in the world, thanks to our kind tutelage over many years.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.3" HREF="#FN4.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As many studies have shown, relative equality is a significant factor in economic growth and improvement in health and living standards. The fact is recognized by the World Bank, but without influencing the policies that it and its IMF associate impose on the Third World, which dramatically increase inequality and undermine other factors that the Bank identifies as essential for growth, notably education and welfare. There is ample historical precedent. For over 200 years, "experiments" have been conducted by the powerful following the highest principles of economic science, with startlingly uniform results: benefits for the experimenters and their power base, tragedies for the experimental animals. Right-thinking people, again, are to draw no conclusions.

<P>A second factor in the general crisis is the huge explosion of unregulated financial capital since the Bretton Woods system was dismantled by Richard Nixon and the radical change in its constitution. Daily turnover on foreign exchange markets may be approaching $1 trillion, some estimate. In the early 1970s, about 90% of capital in international exchanges was for investment and trade, 10% for speculation. By 1990, those figures had reversed, and a 1993 estimate is that only 5% is related to "real economic transactions" (Wilfried Guth of the Deutsche Bank, who argues further that these processes are undermining free trade, as do others). The consequences were understood early on. In his 1978 presidential address to the American Economics Association, Nobel laureate James Tobin suggested that taxes be imposed to slow down speculative flows, which, if unimpeded, would drive the world towards a low-growth, low-wage economy, with booming profits as well. By now, the point is widely recognized; a commission headed by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, attributes about half of the 50% decline in growth rates since the early 1970s to the huge growth of currency speculation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.4" HREF="#FN4.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The world is being moved by state-corporate policy towards a kind of Third world model, with sectors of great wealth, a huge mass of misery, and a large superfluous population, lacking any rights because they contribute nothing to profit-making for the rich.

<P>These developments are commonly attributed to inexorable market forces. Analysts then divide over the contribution of various factors, primarily trade and automation. But the discussion cannot sensibly proceed without recognition of major interferences with markets. Huge state subsidy and intervention have always been required to make trade appear efficient, not to speak of ecological costs imposed on future generations who do not "vote" in the market, and other "externalities" consigned to footnotes. To mention merely one slight market distortion, a good part of the Pentagon budget has been devoted to "secure flow of oil at reasonable prices" from the Middle East, "overwhelmingly the preserve of the United States" (Phebe Marr of the National Defense University) -- a contribution to the "efficiency of trade" that rarely receives attention, apart from other contributions to "the health of the economy." There are plenty of others.

<P>As for automation, it surely contributes to profit at some point, but that point was reached by decades of protection within the state sector, as David Noble has shown. Furthermore, the specific form of automation designed within the state system was often driven by considerations of power more than profit or efficiency; it was designed to deskill workers and subordinate them to management, not because of market principles or the nature of the technology, but for reasons of domination and control.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.5" HREF="#FN4.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Such contributions to private power give further insight into the attractiveness of the military system for modern state capitalism, particularly its appeal to "conservatives," who are commonly in the lead in demanding that markets be undermined for class interests. Reaganite America and Thatcher's England are the primary recent examples -- both paragons of "conservatism," both leaders in expansion of state-subsidized industry. The U.S. case is well-known. As for Thatcher, her blind pursuit of Friedmanite dogmas that were refuted at every turn succeeded in creating the worst crisis for manufacturing industry since the industrial revolution, destroying almost 1/3 of the manufacturing plant within a few years, a fact extensively detailed (and deplored) by actual conservatives, notably Ian Gilmour. Nevertheless, the disaster was somewhat alleviated by the growth of state-subsidized industry. At least in military industry and sale of torture equipment to countries with awful human rights records, England remains a world leader. London is not far behind Washington in its aggressive pursuit of arms sales including such meritorious customers as Saddam Hussein and Suharto, pursuing the shared doctrine expressed by Thatcher's Defense Procurement Minister Alan Clark: "I don't really fill my mind much with what one set of foreigners is doing to another."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.6" HREF="#FN4.6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Corporate decisions for power rather than simple profit are often reasonable enough as a tactic in relentless class war. Particular choices of technology provide one example. The recent health care debacle is another case in point. Much of U.S. industry would probably gain from a rational public insurance program, which is why it was advocated editorially by <CITE>Business Week.</CITE> But it is unwise to allow the general public to realize that government can carry out useful acts. Despite the heavy shadow cast by business, government remains the one system of power and authority that is to some degree under public influence, unlike private tyrannies, which are almost entirely unaccountable. Enhancing their power is worth some sacrifice in profit.

<P>There are other reasons for sacrificing short-run gain. Executives point out to the business press that it is worthwhile to ship manufacturing jobs even to Germany, with its much higher labor costs, so as to facilitate class warfare. A Gillette Corporation executive explains that the company is "concerned about having only one place where a product is made," primarily because of "labor problems." Thus if Boston workers strike, Gillette could supply both the European and U.S. markets from its Berlin plant, thereby breaking the strike; and vice versa. It is only reasonable, then, that Gillette should employ over three times as many workers abroad as in the U.S., irrespective of costs. Strikes of critical importance are now underway in Illinois, where Caterpillar and other corporations are attempting to destroy the last vestige of unions. "Like many US companies, Caterpillar has pursued a business strategy that has nudged American workers away from defiance toward compliance," business correspondent James Tyson reports. The strategy includes "manufacturing at cheaper facilities abroad" and "relying on imports from factories in Brazil, Japan, and Europe" -- and, of course, hiring scabs and temps and relying on the criminal state to refuse to enforce labor laws, a stand raised to principle by the Reaganites,

<P>Such considerations help explain why U.S. corporations are "creating jobs overseas" despite the fact that "a dollar and falling labor costs have made American products increasingly competitive," as the <CITE>Times</CITE> reports. Overseas investment is rising at twice the rates of exports, and profits corporations earn from production abroad are almost double those from exports. These are natural ways to use the "dazzling profits" they reap from "conservative" social policies, and the further gains anticipated from the Gingrich Contract.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.7" HREF="#FN4.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Courts too have sometimes been frank about their contributions to the rollback campaign. Denying an appeal by workers who had lost jobs when Ohio plants were moved to states with cheaper labor, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stated accurately that "States and counties in the United States compete with each other for companies contemplating relocation," and labor laws neither "discourage such relocations" nor bar closing of unionized plants in favor of "a nonunion plant in another part of the country or in a foreign country," as "contemplated" by NAFTA. The Court then explained the background. Congress and the courts "have made the social judgment, rightly or wrongly, that our capitalistic system, Darwinian though it may be, will not discourage companies from locating on the basis of their own calculations of factors relating to efficiency and competitiveness. The rules of the marketplace govern. By so reflecting commercial interests, the institutions of government serve -- according to current legal and economic theory -- the long-term best interests of society as a whole. That is the basic social policy the country has opted to follow."

<P>The candor is unusual, though the deception is typical. "The country" has "opted" for no such course, and it is radically false that "the rules of the market place govern" or that the system is "Darwinian" (in the intended sense of "social Darwinism," which has little to do with biology) -- except, of course, for the poor and the weak, who are indeeed subjected to these rules by those who cast their usual shadow by means of Congress and the courts.

<P>As for the dedication of "legal and economic theory" to "the long-term best interests of society as a whole," perhaps that was best described by Swiss economist Simonde de Sismondi 175 years ago, commenting on the doctrines of the founder of modern economic theory, David Ricardo, who patiently explained that employment was of no consequence to an economy as long as rent and profits, which funded new investment, were in good shape. "Wealth is everything, men are absolutely nothing?," Sismondi replied: "In truth then, there is nothing more to wish for than that the king, remaining alone in the island, by constantly turning a crank, might produce, through automata, all the output of England." Others have no further right to be in England, and should go elsewhere, the laws of the new science proclaimed.

<P>The founders of the science were surpassed by none in their devotion to the "happiness of the people," and even advocated some extension of the franchise to this end: "not indeed, universally to all people, but to that part of them which cannot be supposed to have any interest in overturning the right of property," David Ricardo explained, adding that still heavier restrictions would be appropriate if it were shown that "limiting the elective franchise to the very narrowest bounds" would guarantee more "security for a good choice of representatives." There's an ample record of similar thoughts, and actions, to the present day.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.8" HREF="#FN4.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The internationalization of production puts quite a different cast on contemporary debate about "American decline." As a geographical entity, the country is declining in many respects. But the principal architects of policy have quite different interests, as the "merchants and manufacturers" did in 18th century England, and make sure that they are "most peculiarly attended to," whatever the effect on others, including their own populations. Nothing fundamental has changed in that regard since Adam Smith's observations, apart from the dedicated zeal of the efforts to suppress the obvious. With these truisms in mind, we should not be surprised to find that while the U.S. role in manufacturing production is declining if we consider the geographical entity, it is holding its own quite nicely if we consider the share in global production of U.S.-based corporations. The same is true of the "trade deficit." If we consider international borders, the U.S. has a huge deficit. But when the Commerce Department recalculated, counting profits of U.S. companies abroad as U.S. exports, the deficit turned into a huge surplus: the recalculation was reasonable, the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> explained, because the profits gained abroad "benefit companies domestically through greater investment and R&D." The recalculation interprets the words "United States" in the terms that matter for the "principal architects of policy: not the geographical area or its people, but the people who count.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.9" HREF="#FN4.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>These remarks barely skim the surface. It's easy to understand the mood of desperation, anxiety, hopelessness and fear that is so prevalent in the world, outside of wealthy and privileged sectors who see the opportunity to achieve at last the kind of power that was out of reach when the democratic distemper infected nation-states and popular forces could mobilize to win human rights and defend them.


<A NAME="SEC4.2"><H3>"Intractable Contradictions"</H3></A>

<P>Recall the concerns of <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reporter David Rosenbaum that "however worthy the goals and however sensible the principles" of the Gingrich reformers, their dedication to the poor faces "seemingly intractable contradictions." The most important one, scrupulously ignored, is the need to protect the wealthy and powerful from market discipline in traditional ways, now being extended. But there are other problems.

<P>Educated and privileged sectors, reasoning along Ricardo's lines, see little problem in the fact that policies are executed in "technocratic insulation," unimpeded by public interests and concerns. But the population has to be controlled somehow. For obvious reasons, one cannot appeal to them on grounds of the intended effects of the policies that are being implemented. So other methods are required. There are standard devices. Many can simply be locked up or confined to urban slums. Others can be entrapped by artificial "creation of wants" or other forms of diversion. They can be left in confusion and despair by corporate and other propaganda, a huge industry in the United States for many years. Or they can be mobilized in fear and hatred -- of foreigners, of one another -- or by religious fundamentalist appeals.

<P>The masters of mankind understand very well that people must not be given opportunities to organize in a functioning civil society, which might enable them to pool limited resources and to take their affairs into their own hands. But when the limited admissible means are used to mobilize people to do such needed work as rolling back the social contract, "intractable contradictions" arise. The problems are classic: they were recognized by German industrialists who had supported Hitler's forces as a way to destroy the labor movement, and found -- not to their pleasure -- that he and his followers had some ideas of their own. The Iranian merchants who relied on fundamentalist religious leaders to mobilize the public against the Shah faced the same dilemma shortly after. Some similar "intractable contradictions" are arising right now as the rollback campaign gains force.

<P>The problems have troubled the business press. A <CITE>Fortune</CITE> cover story is headlined "Today's GOP: The Party's Over for Big Business." To mobilize popular forces, the corporate world has been compelled to resort to what are called "cultural issues." But its troops are now prepared to fight the "culture war," as Pat Buchanan and others refer to the various forms of fanaticism they are seeking to engender. That process has opened a "culture gap," <CITE>Fortune</CITE> observes. The CEOs are generally liberal in cultural attitudes. They don't want their children to be forced to pray in schools or taught "creation science." They want their daughters to have opportunities. They not only tend to be pro-choice, but about 60% of CEOs are "adamantly pro-choice, agreeing with the statement that `a woman should be able to get an abortion if she wants one, no matter what the reason'." They do not want to live in a society and culture dominated by Christian fundamentalists, people who worship the Enola Gay or run around with assault rifles, or who debate subtle points about Beast 666 from the Book of Revelations and listen to Pat Robertson explaining how Presidents from Wilson to Bush may have been pawns of "a tightly knit cabal" run by Freemasons and "European bankers," who seek "a new order for the human race under the domination of Lucifer." But these are the sectors they are forced to turn to as a popular base for their assault on democracy and human rights.

<P>Among CEOs, the overwhelming favorite for President is Dick Cheney; Bob Dole and Phil Gramm were backed by a mere 17%, and "right down at the bottom of the pack with a 3% show of support...was Newt Gingrich." Unfortunately for them, however, "The religious right now controls the GOP," <CITE>Fortune</CITE> comments in bold face: "Religious conservatives are the single most powerful force within the GOP," no small group in one of the world's most extreme religious fundamentalist cultures. They "hold veto power over the Republican presidential nomination." "There's a real cultural disconnect between the <CITE>FORTUNE</CITE> 500 and social conservatives," a lobbyist "with strong ties to Christian fundamentalist groups and the new Republicans" observes.

<P>The <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> talks uneasily about "class warfare" -- a term usually avoided like the plague in respectable circles -- referring to a war over "values" that pits the "upper-middle class elites of professionals and managers," their constituency, against the guy in the street who supports the Republican Party that is supposed to do the bidding of these upper-middle class elites. The religious conservatives who hold "veto power" have no great interest in big business, which they rightly see as hostile to the values that they uphold. They gain support from "a few large companies on the fringe of corporate America -- the tobacco industry, Amway." But within the functioning economy, they are viewed with no little dismay, apart from their role in implementing the rollback campaign. They oppose government support for big corporations, threatening a disaster for "free enterprise" if they cannot be kept down in the trenches. They agree that "It's rollback time," as one of their activists says, but they have in mind something quite different from the CEOs. They don't like it when a corporation that has its home in Gingrich's Cobb County denounces an official resolution condemning "the gay life style." The CEOs rightly fear that their troops may move beyond the "culture war," proceeding to undermine the basic framework of state-subsidized private power.

<P>Funding for the Gingrich army reveals the contradictions clearly. Major funders are from marketing schemes like Amway, smaller insurance companies, hedge-funds, and the like. These sectors control plenty of money but are at the fringes of the economy. They are "very much in sync with the `Contract With America'," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reports, which is true only under a special but perhaps accurate interpretion of the support for the Pentagon on the part of their forces, who, unlike the CEOs, are not much interested in the government's role as the "savior" of advanced industry. Furthermore, they come from sectors of the population that really are cringing in fear and terror, seeing enemies coming to get them on all sides, a fact about the extraordinary cultural scene that one cannot simply ignore.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.10" HREF="#FN4.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The contradictions are showing up in Washington. The Commerce Department under Clinton has become "a pro-business dynamo," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> observes, serving private power to an unprecedented degree. But the Gingrich army doesn't understand, which leads to an "uncanny circumstance: Big business allied with a Democratic administration against Republic proposals to trim Commerce's sails." The same is true of the Export-Import Bank, the National Institutes of Health (which have "given birth to the biotechnology industry," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> observes), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Technology Reinvestment Project, Clinton-inspired adjuncts to the Pentagon subsidy to advanced industry. These are wasteful because they are not devoted solely to "military uses," GOP critics charge, failing to comprehend the way the real economy works and perhaps believing the lurid tales about Beast 666, Arab terrorists, and who knows what other agent of Lucifer or the United Nations. Even the hated regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have support from major corporations, which can see ahead far enough to judge the effects of another thalidomide scandal.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.11" HREF="#FN4.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the early part of this century, there was much fascination with "corporate entities," social "organisms" that have unique rights beyond those of mere individuals. These ideas, growing from more or less the same Hegelian intellectual soil, took several forms, notably Bolshevism, fascism, and the modern corporation. Corporations were granted extraordinary rights by Courts and lawyers, often with the support of "progressives." They are, furthermore, as totalitarian an institution as humans have managed so far to contrive. Terminology is crafted to avoid the substance behind the shadow, so such terms as "fascist" and "totalitarian" are restricted to political entities. But the similarity in character is unmistakeable. Two of these systems of centralized, autocratic, and unaccountable power have succumbed. The third not only remains but is increasing its sway and dominance. There are divisions and conflicts of course, but also much similarity of general conception worldwide, and overarching institutions are also taking shape. The internal contradictions may or may not prove "intractable," but they have ominous import however they are resolved.

<P>The transition from containment of democracy and human rights to actual rollback should be seen against this background. We should also recognize that the new phase of the struggle against the "great beast" is based upon social policies with particular goals that are not graven in stone or founded in laws of nature or society, any more than the human institutions from which they arise.

<P>The elections of 1994 are described as a "political earthquake," a "triumph of conservatism" that reflects the continuing "drift to the right" on the part of the American population. The victorious Gingrich army of well-trained, well-funded "conservatives" call for a Contract with America that will finally "get government off our backs" so that we can return to the happy days when the free market reigned. They will restore "family values," ridding us of "the excesses of the welfare state" and the other residues of the failed "big government" policies of New Deal liberalism and Johnson's "Great Society." By dismantling the "nanny state" they will succeed, where the Democrats have failed, to achieve the shared goal of all elite and leadership elements: to "create jobs for Americans" and win security and freedom for the "middle class." And they will take over and successfully lead the crusade to establish the American Dream of free market democracy, worldwide.

<P>One of the great achievements of contemporary ideological warfare has been to debase the terms of political discourse so thoroughly that such statements as these are not entirely false, if we keep to what has become conventional usage. As Orwell predicted, this achievement has undermined the possibility even of talking sensibly about what is happening in the world. Still, independent minds -- including any authentic conservatives who might be located in the outer reaches of the political arena or intellectual world -- can refuse to be swept up in the fashionable currents and use terms with their actual meanings to describe what is happening, and why.


<A NAME="SEC1.1"><H3>1. The Triumph of Conservatism</H3></A>

<P>Most of this, we also heard just ten years ago, when Reagan was elected by a 2-1 vote, the second "conservative landslide" in four years. In his 1980 triumph, presidential historian William Leuchtenberg observed, "Reagan, far from having won in a landslide, got little more than a bare majority of the popular vote and only 28% of the potential electorate, and exit polls showed that the vote was not "for Reagan" but "against Carter," who had in fact initiated the policies that the Reaganites took up and implemented, with the general support of congressional Democrats: accelerating military spending (meaning, in particular, the state sector of the economy) while cutting back programs that aid the vast majority. Polls in 1980 revealed that 11% of Reagan voters chose him because "he's a real conservative" -- whatever that term is supposed to mean.

<P>In 1984, despite vast attempts to get out the vote, the totals increased by 1%. The percentage who chose Reagan because he was a "real conservative" dropped to 4%, while 70% of all voters with an opinion on the matter opposed Reaganite legislative programs, and public opinion studies showed a continuation of the steady drift towards a kind of New Deal-style welfare state liberalism on the part of the general population. Their concerns and desires were not articulated in the political system, however; one reason, surely, why voting was so sharply skewed towards privileged sectors.

<P>The reasons why voting is so dramatically an elite affair in the United States are revealed by comparative studies. Analysis of thirty democracies showed "a significant correlation between high voter turnout and the presence of political parties representing clearly defined strata of society -- that is, parties strongly tied to specific income classes, religious groupings, or language groups" (political commentator Thomas Edsall, 1984). In economic policy, Edsall added, the U.S. political system fails to represent "the interests of the bottom three-fifths of society." To use a phrase that is unspeakable in polite society without shock quotes, when the "class interests" of the privileged and powerful are the guiding commitment of all political parties, people who do not share these interests tend to stay home. The class pattern of abstention "seems inseparably linked to another crucial comparative peculiarity of the American political system," political scientist William Dean Burnham observed: "the total absence of a socialist or laborite party as an organized competitor in the electoral market." That absence relates to and is fortified by the effective dismantling of civil society: unions, political organizations, and so on.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.1" HREF="#FN1.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the 1980s, the U.S. and Britain took the lead in the "triumph of conservatism," accelerating processes already underway. They therefore lead the developed world in impoverishment and degradation, inequality, homelessness, destruction of family values, hunger, and other values of contemporary "conservatism." A study by the British charitable organization Action for Children, founded in 1869 with the Queen as patron, concludes that "the gap between rich and poor is as wide today as it was in Victorian times," and in some ways worse. A million and a half families cannot afford to provide their children with "the diet fed to a similar child living in a Bethnal Green Workhouse in 1876," a "sad reflection on British society." Britain has proportionately more children living in poverty than any European country apart from Portugal and Ireland, and the proportion is rising faster than any country in Europe, though the U.S. still holds the lead.

<P>Britain has also not yet matched the achievements of the doctrinal system crafted by our highly class conscious business community, with the assistance of those whom the lively 19th century working class press called "the bought priesthood" of respectable intellectuals. The fact that there is "class conflict" and that the rich and powerful mobilize state power to serve their interests, a truism to Adam Smith, remains within popular consciousness. The 1994 Gallup Political and Economic Index gives interesting information about popular attitudes on these matters (I put aside small numbers, 3%-10%, expressing no opinion). The study reports that over four-fifths of the population think "there is a class struggle in this country" and that "too little" is being done "to level up the classes." Two-thirds "disagree strongly" with the statement "Britain is a classless society." Nine out of ten feel that the Government does "too little" for "the working class," four-fifths that it does "too much" for "the well-to-do," and over 90% that it does "too little" for "people living on small pensions/income." Half also think it does "too little" for "the middle classes." Three-fourths "think of Britain as divided into haves and have-nots," and a third describe themselves as among "the haves."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.2" HREF="#FN1.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Let's return to 1994, the next in the series of "conservative landslides," this time under the leadership of Newt Gingrich. "Republicans claimed about 52 percent of all votes cast for candidates in contested House seats, slightly better than a two-point improvement from 1992" (Richard Morin, director of polling for the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>). One out of six voters described the outcome as "an affirmation of the Republican agenda"; 60% said it "was a repudiation of the Democrats." A "more conservative Congress" was considered to be an issue by a rousing 12% of the voters. An "overwhelming majority had never heard of" the Gingrich Contract with America, articulating the Republican agenda, though a majority opposed one of its central components: "defense increases," a code-word for public subsidies to advanced industry. The chief pollster of the <CITE>Los Angeles Times</CITE> pointed out that just before the election, 61% of those polled said "that spending for domestic programs should be <I>increased</I>."

<P>All of this echoes the situation of a decade ago.

<P>The opposition to Democrats is more nuanced. Clinton-style "New Democrats" -- in effect, moderate Republicans -- "lost their seats at twice the rate of their more liberal colleagues," Ken Silverstein and Alexander Cockburn report. The "more liberal" Democrats are those who tried to activate the old Democratic coalition of working people, women, the poor: the majority of the population who see themselves, correctly, as effectively disenfranchised.

<P>To put these figures in further perspective, it must be recalled that voting was even more heavily skewed towards the wealthy and privileged than before. As compared with 1992, 7% more voters were wealthy, 7% fewer were working class, political scientist Peter Levine comments, noting also that Democrats were overwhelmingly preferred by voters who earn less than $30,000 a year and ran even with Republicans in the $30,000-$49,000 range. There was also a very large gender and color gap, white males voting mostly Republican, while women, Blacks and Hispanics voted for Democrats (overwhelmingly, in the Black-Hispanic category, where participation was low). Those with no more than high school education, along with those with postgraduate education, favored Democrats. Those who sensed a decline in their standard of living voted for Republicans by close to two to one -- mostly white males with just high school degrees "whose economic futures are highly uncertain," Thomas Edsall observes; just those who would have been part of a left-populist coalition committed to equitable economic growth and political democracy, were such an option to intrude into our business-run political system.

<P>The message, however, was just the opposite: Clinton must abandon the left-wing agenda that the voters had just overwhelmingly rejected and return to what he had promised to be in 1992: a "New Democrat." And he was quick to pick up the cues. In a satellite address to the National League of cities, "Clinton used some variation of the words `work,' `jobs' or `working families' more than 40 times as he raised `New Democrat' themes such as welfare reform, national service, lifelong job training, and the need to `attack problems that feed dependency'," the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> reported under the headline: "Clinton seen returning to `New Democrat' stance." The report didn't say when he had left that stance for some different one, on any issue of importance to rich and powerful. If he had, <CITE>Business Week</CITE> hadn't noticed. "Corporate America did fine riding in tandem with Clinton," the journal reports, though "it did equally well when they diverged."

<P>Despite all his efforts to please, still business "basically hates the Clinton Administration," <CITE>Business Week</CITE> continues, and gives him "little credit" for advancing the corporate agenda. Why? The reasons they give, and cite from polls of executives, are hard to take seriously. But there is one very good reason. Leading sectors of wealth and privilege taste blood. They think, with some reason, that they have the world's population by the throat, and are in a position to roll back the hated welfare state for the general population and everything that goes with it: health and safety standards, labor rights and human rights generally, indeed any infringement on their right to pursue "the vile maxim," as Adam Smith described the goal of the masters: "all for ourselves, and nothing for other people." Given that awareness, it makes sense to "hate" anyone who may have a somewhat flawed commitment to the sole human value: "Gain Wealth, forgetting all but Self," "the New Spirit of the Age" denounced by the lively and vigorous working class press 150 years ago, as working people fought to save human values from the rising tide of private tyranny.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.3" HREF="#FN1.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Yet another factor, scarcely noted here, has to be taken into account in evaluating the electoral results. Under the headline "Big money still garners the big vote," George Graham observed in the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> that money "spoke as loud as ever in the most expensive campaign on record." With a few notable exceptions, electoral victory tracked campaign financing closely -- again, no departure from the norm and natural in a political system in which the less affluent majority does not participate and is scarcely represented.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.4" HREF="#FN1.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Voters selected "welfare reform" as their top priority, with health care reform second and crime also ranking high. These choices, which in part reflect a grasp of reality, also have to be understood against the background of recent propaganda offensives.

<P>To begin with reality, for most of the population, conditions of life and work are grim and declining, something new in the history of industrial society. Median income declined even during the "Clinton recovery," falling to 7% below the 1989 level by late 1993, the Census Bureau reported. The decline was accompanied by -- and in no small measure caused by -- much-lauded improvements in "flexibility of labor markets." The latter is a technical term referring to elimination of job security and other such "market rigidities" that interfere with "economic health," another ideological construct. As designed for the purposes of population control, "economic health" is unrelated to the welfare of the population but crafted to measure what is valued by the rich: speculators, bond holders, investors, professionals who serve the state-corporate sector. Continuing the decline during the Reagan years, after a decade of stagnation, pay for private sector employees fell 4% from 1988 to 1994, with blue collar wages suffering most and white collar wages still below 1990 and well below 1988. Despite much misleading hype, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a continuing "shift to lower-wage industries and higher wage-occupations," executive and professional, while noting that the overwhelming majority of these are in lower-paid service industries (motel manager, and the like). That means sharply increased inequality, with the majority suffering reductions in absolute terms along with much worse work conditions.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.5" HREF="#FN1.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>But some folks are doing just fine. "The percentage of corporate income devoted to payrolls is hovering near a record low," <CITE>Fortune</CITE> magazine reported in November, having dropped sharply during the "conservative landslide" of the early 1980s, and again since 1992. With the "New Democrats" at the helm, "1993 was a bracingly upbeat year for the FORTUNE 500," the journal exulted in its April 1994 annual review of the state of the important people, who posted "dazzling" profits despite "virtually stagnant" sales growth. The ecstatic story was headed: "Hats Off! It Was a Heck of a Year" -- at least, for those who matter.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.6" HREF="#FN1.6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>While in part realistic, the expressed concerns of voters reflect the great victories of the ideological warfare that has been conducted with relentless intensity since the early 1970s in the effort to overcome the perceived "crisis of democracy." Across the political spectrum, privileged sectors were naturally appalled by the attempts of the great majority of the population to escape from the apathy and marginalization that is their proper place and to enter the political arena, forgetting that in a democracy the role of the "ignorant and meddlesome outsiders" is to be mere "spectators," not "participants," as Walter Lippmann put it in his progressive essays on democracy 70 years ago, expressing the doctrines of "Wilsonian idealism." It therefore became necessary to renew with much greater intensity the constant campaign to tame and cage that "great <I>beast</I>," as Alexander Hamilton termed the "people" with horror and indignation as he was laying the foundations for state-guided industrial democracy. The beast may not yet be tamed, but it is being caged; sometimes quite literally, sometimes in chains of dogma and deceit, an important victory.

<P>We may recall, in passing, that fear of democracy and freedom has always been one of the factors motivating the terror and sometimes outright aggression undertaken to eliminate "rotten apples" that might "spoil the barrel" and "viruses" that might "infect others," in the terminology favored by leading planners -- the main concern, of course, being independence, whatever cast it takes. That helps explain the passion of Washington's terrorist wars in Central America in recent years, or to take a current example, Washington's not-so-tacit support for its trainees and associates in the Haitian military as they did their necessary work, and the restoration of the rule of their backers among the Haitian elite under the guise of "democracy," now that the work is done and the Generals can be sent off to the life of luxury, which, they understood correctly, would be their reward for services rendered. Behind the supercilious racist rhetoric about "civilizing Aristide" and teaching him "lessons in democracy" lies a real fear: that the democratic virus in Haiti might even infect these shores. People here might realize that we have a great deal to learn about democracy from the peasants and slum-dwellers of Haiti, who constructed a vibrant civil society that offered the "great beast" a chance to take some control over their lives. Their crime brings to mind the call for freedom for all people that was sounded for the first time in Haiti two centuries ago, outraging the civilized opinion of that day.

<P>One consequence of the huge propaganda campaigns of the past several decades is the mood of "antipolitics" reported in feature stories. Concealed from public view is the fact that "politics is the shadow cast on society by big business," as John Dewey stated the truism familiar at least since Adam Smith, adding that as long as this is so, "the attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance." Reforms are of limited utility. Democracy requires that the source of the shadow be removed, not only because of its domination of the political arena, but because the very institutions of private power undermine democracy and freedom; again, an observation familar back to the Founding Fathers.

<P>But the source of the shadow has to be driven from the mind. Naturally, this is a leading theme of the literature of the ultraright foundations that are seeking to drive the educational system and media towards an even narrower fringe of the permissible spectrum. At the other extreme, Clinton campaign literature spoke movingly about workers and their firms and how government must help them; missing from the picture were bosses, profits, investors, and the like. There are "entrepreneurs," nice folk who appear now and then to help the workers and their firms. They then sink into the background along with the unmentionables, who are laboring for the common good, selflessly seeking to provide jobs and decent lives for ordinary people in the "civil society" in which all participate.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.7" HREF="#FN1.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The fanaticism of the effort to conceal the obvious has reached comic proportions. After the latest APEC summit in Jakarta in November, front-page headlines announced that "Clinton Is Stern With Indonesia On Rights but Gleeful on Trade" (<CITE>New York Times</CITE>). The "sternness on rights" consisted of a few whimpers denounced by Indonesian human rights activists and labor leaders (those still out of jail), but the Glee on Trade was real enough. It reflects the successes of "the Administration's campaign of commercial diplomacy" that "will mean jobs for Americans," <CITE>Times</CITE> political correspondent Elaine Sciolino reported with admiration. Clinton firmed up $40 billion in joint projects in his campaign for "jobs for Americans"; at least $35 billion, possibly more, was an arrangement between Exxon and the Indonesian state oil company Pertamina to develop an off-shore natural gas field, which could "mean new jobs for US businesses that help set up wells and off-shore platforms," the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> reported. Exxon's Indonesia affiliate and Pertamina are expected to sell the liquified gas almost exclusively in Asia. GE, Hughes, Fluor Daniel, and other major corporations won contracts as well for projects in Indonesia. Another Exxon-Pertamina project is a new plant to supply Indonesia's state-owned electricity company, the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> added, noting also that U.S. taxpayers are generously helping to fund the projects by credits from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, "part of new US `Tied-Aid' credit offers."

<P>All of this is sure to provide a huge flow of jobs for Americans -- at least lawyers, bankers, executives and managers, maybe a handful of skilled workers for a short period. But profits for U.S. investors? Perish the thought! The good news for U.S. workers caused a sharp increase in Exxon's stock.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.8" HREF="#FN1.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Another victory for efficient propaganda is that people wildly overestimate the percentage of the federal budget that goes to foreign aid and welfare. In fact, over half of discretionary federal spending is devoted to the military, one reason why "the United States faces social and structural economic problems of a magnitude unknown to other economically advanced states," Benjamin Schwarz of the RAND corporation notes, including "higher rates of infant mortality, illiteracy, malnutrition, and poverty than any other advanced industrialized country." All getting worse, predictably, as the class war of the past decades intensifies in vigor and savagery. A study of the Bread for the World Institute reported a considerable decline in people suffering from hunger throughout the world in the 1980s, with only two exceptions: Africa, which registered an increase from 36% to 37%, and the United States, where the numbers increased 50% from 1985 to 1990 as "conservative" reforms took hold, increasing since.

<P>The problem is most severe among children, with effects that are permanent: it is well-known that "development of the brain is strongly influenced by the quality of the nourishment and nurturance given to infants and children," among other effects of "adverse environments" early in life that can lead "to permanent defects in memory and learning" (medical researchers John Frank and Fraser Mustard). But hunger among the elderly is also "surging," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reports: "several million older Americans are going hungry -- and their numbers are growing steadily," despite a federal law in force for 20 years "aimed at providing free meals to anyone over 60." Many are literally "starving to death" while some 5 million, about 16% of the population over 60, "are either hungry or malnourished to some degree" -- again, phenomena unknown in other developed societies, which lag behind us in the crusade for freedom and justice. "The level of malnutrition and real hunger is only increasing," the assistant secretary for aging at the U.S. Department of Health reports.

<P>To fully comprehend the meaning of such facts, one must bear in mind the unparalleled advantages of the United States. To select merely one indication, health and life expectancy levels of mid-18th century Americans were not achieved by the <I>upper classes in Britain</I> until the early 20th century -- not to speak of less privileged parts of the world. The social and economic catastrophe of American capitalism is quite an extraordinary phenomenon -- for the "great beast," that is.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.9" HREF="#FN1.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Only 30% of the population are aware that military spending is the largest item on the Federal budget, and few of those know its scale or its purpose.  Over a quarter think foreign aid is the biggest item. In fact, it is barely detectable. The U.S. has the most miserly record among the developed countries. The record is even worse if we exclude the parts intended to enhance U.S. control over Middle East energy reserves, "aid" to Israel, Egypt, and Turkey. By far the largest per capita component goes to a rich country, Israel -- artificially rich, because of the completely unparalleled flow of foreign capital including not just "aid" but also tax-deductible contributions that are used to maintain the sharp divisions between first- and second-class citizens, and (despite disclaimers) for the joint U.S.-Israel project of incorporating the bulk of the occupied territories within the eventual state of Israel. Eliminate that, and U.S. aid virtually vanishes -- putting aside its character and effects.

<P>One-fifth of the population believe welfare to be the largest Federal expense. It is not too surprising, then, that the top priority for voters in 1994 was "welfare reform" (46%). The welfare system is "just out of control," voters felt, though it pays to look more closely at actual attitudes. 44% of respondents feel that we are spending "too much" on welfare and 23% "too little, economist Nancy Folbre notes, but when the phrase "assistance to the poor" is substituted for "welfare" in the same question, 13% say we are spending "too much" and 64% "too little." A reasonable speculation is that many people have absorbed Reaganite lies about "welfare Queens" (by insinuation, Black) driving Cadillacs, and believe that working people are supporting rich welfare recipients -- as they are, but not in the sense they imagine; we return to that.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.10" HREF="#FN1.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As already noted, the second-ranking priority for voters was health care reform (37%), though the impressive ideological warfare of the past year has left people utterly confused about what the realistic options might be. Public debate was framed within narrow bounds, the Clinton plan being the "liberal option," with a few gestures to the "radical extremists" who thought the U.S. might consider joining the rest of the industrial world. The incomprehensible Clinton plan -- basically, a giveaway to huge insurance companies -- was rejected as just another "big government" proposal that would place people's fate in the hands of pointy-headed bureaucrats who steal our money by imposing a crushing tax burden; a publicly funded insurance program, to the extent it could even be considered, is still more odious in that respect.

<P>The option preferred by the privileged is for the fate of everyone else to be in the hands of insurance company executives whose goal, as Milton Friedman can explain, is to ensure maximum profit and market share: meaning the worst possible health care; elimination of personal choice except for the rich; huge bureaucracies to micromanage physicians; public subsidy for advertising, profits, and multiple layers of high-paid managers and executives; and other massive inefficiencies that drive the U.S. off the spectrum in costs for heath care. The real meaning of the "conservative" option was illustrated right after the November election at the annual scientific convention of the American Heart Association, where leading specialists reported that insurers are increasingly unwilling to pay for preventive care that would reduce hospitalization rates by 75% (Dr. Lynne Stevenson of Boston's Brigham and Women's hospital). In contrast, they are quite willing to pay for heart transplants -- high tech operations that enrich the right people and institutions.

<P>One radical extremist thought that rarely reached threshold is that in a civilized society, the costs of health care should be borne by progressive taxation, on the basis of the principle that the poor should be exempted from taxation, which should "tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise" -- as observed by the noted Marxist Thomas Jefferson in a letter to his fellow-subversive James Madison. The United States is, again, off the spectrum on this aspect of human rights and needs, as measured by public share of health-care spending (which is as progressive as the tax system). The U.S. is far below any country that has achieved any form of development, even Greece and Portugal; it is barely above Turkey.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.11" HREF="#FN1.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>


<A NAME="SEC1.2"><H3>2. "Really existing conservatism"</H3></A>

<P>The propaganda victories come into sharper focus when we compare popular perceptions with social and economic realities. Take welfare. It has sharply declined in real terms since 1970, Nancy Folbre observes, a downward spiral that is continuing, with more reductions in Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in 1991 than in any year since 1981. From 1970, maximum AFDC benefits for a family of three with no other income fell over 40%, and the national average of AFDC benefits and food stamps combined is now at the level of AFDC alone in 1960 (before the food-stamp program was initiated).

<P>A still more severe distortion is the unspoken premise that child care is not work: it comes free, like women's domestic labor generally -- "the main reason why free-enterprise economies have worked relatively well over the decades," economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett comments. Child care therefore contrasts with Real Work: speculating in currency markets, devising tax shelters for the rich, arranging mergers and acquisitions that significantly reduce R&D and hence economic growth, and other contributions that rank high on the scale of social utility and merit according to standard dogma, which measures it by economic reward to the "worker." In particular, single women taking care of children are plainly not working, and therefore must be driven to the official workforce on grounds of "economic efficiency" (not to speak of justice), bipartisan doctrine holds. The assumptions are somewhere between nonsensical and insane, though reasonable enough within the general intellectual culture, with its tacit dedication to class warfare.

<P>Even on the narrowest grounds, Folbre observes in the American Economic Association proceedings, "public policy literally transfers resources from parents to nonparents by providing social insurance based on participation in paid employment without explicitly valuing time, effort, or money devoted to children," who are, in the longer term, the crucial factor determining "economic health" even in the highly distorted ideological sense of the technical notion. When real incomes in the middle quintile (about $30,000 in 1992 dollars) are adjusted for child care costs, they decline slightly through the 1970s, quite sharply from 1980 to the present as "conservatism triumphed."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.12" HREF="#FN1.12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Responding to the "public mood" that has been shaped by a propaganda offensive of unusual intensity and fervor, the highest priority for the new Gingrich conservatives is to dismantle the welfare system. They announced at once that they would repeal the Food Stamp Act of 1977, the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, the National School Lunch Act of 1946, the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983, and other Federals laws intended to prevent hunger, particularly among children, which has not increased rapidly enough to satisfy the advocates of "family values" and "free market" verities. Furthermore, what programs remain are to be transferred to states, so as to bar any response to the typical sharp increase in need for food assistance when there is a recession, as in 1991-2, when food stamp rolls sometimes grew by 300,000 people a month. The plans will "lead to a dramatic increase in hunger," Senator Patrick Leahy observed realistically; but that's nothing that has ever troubled the more loyal servants of the rich. Also on the legislative agenda -- with the support of the New Democrats -- are work obligations for mothers (who do not "work," by ideological fiat) and reduction of AFDC, the main Federal Welfare program, which reaches 14.3 million people, over 9 million of them young children, who must "learn responsibility" and internalize our values: that there are no human rights, apart from what can be won in the labor market.

<P>It would be unfair, however, to regard the leader, Newt Gingrich, as a heartless wretch. He proposes that the money saved from AFDC programs be used to build orphanages or "group homes" for children of families rendered destitute -- the state being the proper provider for children, not their mothers, under the doctrine of "family values." Perhaps the proposal is intended as a special contribution to the 1994 International Year of the Family. Or perhaps it is simply another useful federal subsidy, providing benefits to the construction industry, lawyers, and other people of the right sort.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.13" HREF="#FN1.13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The real meaning of "free market conservatism" is illustrated by a closer look at the most passionate enthusiasts for "getting the government off our backs" and letting the market reign undisturbed. Take Newt Gingrich, the leader of the victorious congressional army who are taking over under a "master plan" that relied on huge contributions for Gingrich's GOPAC committee from corporate donors and others whose identity is a carefully-guarded secret. The measures are of dubious legality; GOPAC is now being sued by the Federal Elections Commission on grounds that it "failed to register and report as a political committee." But legal questions aside, the power play was "a calculated political operation, unique on the contemporary American political scene" (Ellen Miller, director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics), yet another blow at the despised principles of democracy and the pretensions of the "great beast" to meddle where it doesn't belong.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.14" HREF="#FN1.14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Gingrich represents Cobb County Georgia, which the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> -- reasonably enough -- selected in a recent front-page story to illustrate the rising tide of "conservatism" aimed at ridding us of the "nanny state." The headline reads "Conservatism Flowering Among the Malls," in this wealthy suburb of Atlanta, one of several that "offer -- particularly to whites -- a sense of prosperity and safety, conservative Southern values and a relaxed, friendly way of life." It's a "Norman Rockwell world with fiber optic computers and jet airplanes," Gingrich comments with pride. With its "history of inhospitality toward blacks," Cobb County is scrupulously insulated from any urban infection so that the inhabitants can enjoy the fruits of their "enterpreneurial values" and market enthusiasms in "the conservative heart of a conservative region," defended in Congress by the leader of the conservative triumph.

<P>A small footnote: Cobb County receives more federal subsidies than any suburban county in the country, with two exceptions: Arlington Virginia, effectively part of the Federal Government, and Brevard County Florida, the home of the Kennedy Space Center. When we move out of the state system itself, Cobb County is the leading beneficiary of the "nanny state." Its largest employer is Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company, which is designing the F-22 advanced tactical fighter and other military aircraft. 72% of the workforce are in white-collar jobs "in expanding areas of the economy like insurance, electronics and computers, and trade" -- all carefully tended by "the nanny state." It's remarkably easy for conservative entrepreneurial values to flourish while one is feeding happily at the public trough. Meanwhile praises to market miracles reach the heavens, notably where "conservatism is flowering among the malls."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.15" HREF="#FN1.15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>An interesting sidelight is the silence over this matter during the electoral campaign, when Gingrich propaganda was smashing the New Democrats. Notably absent is a simple rejoinder that would have stopped the juggernaut in its tracks: Gingrich is the country's leading advocate of the welfare state -- for the rich. The reasons for the silence are not hard to discern: class interests prevail over narrow electoral ones. It's agreed across the board that the rich must be protected from market discipline by a powerful and interventionist welfare state.

<P>Gingrich is the author of the "Contract with America," which calls for extending the double-edged "free market": state protection and public subsidy for the rich, market discipline for the poor. The Contract calls for "cuts in social spending," denying aid to children of "minor mothers" and those on welfare. Republican leaders add that they will support reductions proposed in the plan submitted by John Kasich, top Republican on the Budget Committee; its biggest cut is to be $50 billion from medicare and medicaid, the health programs for the elderly and the poor. But the Contract calls for an increase in welfare for the rich, by the classic means: regressive fiscal measures, and outright subsidy. These include increased tax exemptions for gifts and estates, capital gains cuts, reduced regulation for protection of health and safety standards, investment subsidies, more favorable rules for depreciation, and most important: "strengthening our national defense" so that we can better "maintain our credibility around the world" -- so that anyone who gets funny ideas, like priests and nuns in Latin America, will understand that "What We Say Goes," as George Bush defined the New World Order while bombs and missiles were raining on Iraq.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.16" HREF="#FN1.16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>"National defense" is, of course, a sick joke, which would elicit ridicule outside of a commissar culture. The U.S. faces no threats, and already spends almost as much on "defense" as the rest of the world combined. As in the past, military spending is arguably increasing security threats, for example, by arms exports, which now provide 25% of revenue for "defense" contractors and dominate the international arms market, increasing sharply since the end of the Cold War. Clinton has just added an important innovation: for the first time, policy will "factor the health of U.S. weapons makers and the shape of the domestic economy into decisions on whether to approve foreign arms sales," the press reports; a natural step, now that the Soviet pretext has collapsed and it becomes necessary to face the facts more honestly.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.17" HREF="#FN1.17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Unlike "defense" and "security," military expenditures are no joke. They ensure that we will be able to "behave, with others, multilaterally when we can and unilaterally as we must," the Clinton version of the traditional doctrine, delivered to the UN Security Council by Ambassador Madeleine Albright as it wavered over a resolution condemning Iraq. Albright instructed the Council that if need be, the U.S. would act alone because "We recognize this area as vital to U.S. national interests" -- and we recognize no limits or constraints, surely nothing as ridiculous as international law, human rights, or the United Nations, as we pursue our role as self-appointed global enforcer.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.18" HREF="#FN1.18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Apart from maintaining a particular form of "stability" in the interests of the world rulers, the Pentagon must continue to provide lavishly for Newt Gingrich and his rich constituents by means of a taxpayer subsidy to advanced industry. Nothing has changed in this regard since the early post-war period, when the business world recognized that the aircraft industry, established by public funds and wartime profiteering, "cannot satisfactorily exist in a pure, uncompetitive, unsubsidized, `free enterprise' economy" (<CITE>Fortune</CITE>) and that "the government is their only possible savior" (<CITE>Business Week</CITE>). For well-known reasons, the Pentagon system was revitalized as the "savior," sustaining and expanding the industry, now the leading "civilian" exporter, along with steel and metals generally, electronics, chemicals, machine tools, and other central components of the industrial economy. As long as the fable could be sustained, the Cold War provided the pretext. The fraud was conscious, at least among those minimally astute. The first Secretary of the Air Force, Stuart Symington, put the matter plainly in January 1948: "The word to talk was not `subsidy'; the word to talk was `security'." As industry representative in Washington, Symington regularly demanded enough procurement funds in the military budget to "meet the requirements of the aircraft industry," in his words. The story continues without essential change until today, in just about every functioning sector of the economy, and surely in Cobb County.

<P>Furthermore, the story goes back to the origins of the Republic: economic historian Paul Bairoch describes the United States as the "mother country and bastion of modern protectionism," which was "born in the United States" -- which may be unfair to our British predecessors, no laggards in the art. Protectionism is only one form of state intervention, and not the major one. As in the British case, there are intermittent deviations from the commitment to protect the rich from market discipline, related to the expectation of temporary gain under conditions of dominance. When need arises, "conservatives" are quick to call for increased state intervention, as in the Reagan years. Had market forces been allowed to function, there would be no U.S. steel or automobile industry today, not to speak of computer chips and electronics generally. The Reaganites simply closed the market to Japanese competition while pouring in public funds.

<P>Then-Secretary of the Treasury, James Baker proudly proclaimed to a business audience that Reagan had "granted more import relief to US industry than any of his predecessors in more than half a century." He was far too modest: it was actually more all his predecessors combined, doubling import restrictions to 23%. One of the few authentic free trade advocates, international economist Fred Bergsten, added that the Reagan Administration specialized in the kind of "managed trade" that most "restricts trade and closes markets," voluntary export restraint agreements -- which are "voluntary" in the sense that protection payments to the Mafia enforcer are "voluntary." This is "the most insidious form of protectionism," Bergsten pointed out, which "raises prices, reduces competition and reinforces cartel behavior." The 1994 Economic Report to Congress estimates that Reaganite protectionist measures reduced US manufacturing imports by about one-fifth. Such measures have been expanded under Clinton, one recent example being the proposal to spend $1 billion to subsidize development and production of flat-panel computer display screens, subsidies barred by the GATT accords signed a few weeks earlier.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.19" HREF="#FN1.19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>This is just the tip of the iceberg. The "bought priesthood" may spin tales about market discipline and its virtues, but business executives and the government that is their "shadow" will tolerate no such nonsense -- for the rich, that is.

<P>Gingrich's Contract is remarkably brazen. Thus the proposals for welfare for the rich appear under the heading "The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act." The section does include a provision for measures "to create jobs and raise worker wages" -- with the word "unfunded" quietly added. But no matter. In contemporary Newspeak, the word "jobs" means "profits," so it is indeed a "job creation" proposal, which will continue to "enhance" wages downwards.

<P>The pattern is virtually exceptionless. Former Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell was replaced in November by Olympia Snowe, a prominent conservative, whose campaign focused on protecting the Portsmouth Naval shipyard and Loring Air Force base -- that is, making sure that Federal largesse continues to flow, the benefits heavily skewed towards the wealthy, though the official mantra is "jobs." Even looking just at the narrow matter of welfare, we find much the same thing. The Center for Popular Economics (Amherst) estimates that when we consider direct benefits and tax breaks -- masked welfare payments -- an average household with income under $10,000 receives about 60% of the welfare provided to households with income over $100,000. Looking at details, total payments for food stamps in 1993 amounted to $25 billion, welfare and family support $16 billion, and supplemental security income (poor, elderly, disabled) $21 billion. These figures may be compared with the $49 billion in deductions for interest payments, mostly mortgage payments (80% to familes with incomes over $50,000, skewed more radically toward the higher reaches, for obvious reasons). Farm price supports, again skewed toward the wealthy, amounted to $16 billion. Total payments to the poor "add up to less than the three largest tax breaks that benefit the middle class and wealthy: deductions for retirement plans, the deduction for home mortgage interest and the exemption of health-insurance premiums that companies pay for their employees," Michael Wines reports in the <CITE>Times</CITE> in a rare window opened to the real world, noting further that "most tax breaks and payments to the well-situated are practically exempt from the debate over controlling expenditures."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.20" HREF="#FN1.20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>This, of course, is the merest fragment, not counting such matters as "business expenses" (dinners at elegant restaurants, prize seats at the opera and sporting events, club memberships, etc.), all small in comparison with the massive subsidies through the system of protection and subsidy by the "nanny state." Simply to indicate scale, in Canada, less extreme than the U.S. in its dedication to a nanny state for the rich, the National Council of Welfare estimates that day care facilities for the 750,000 children who need them would cost $1.5 billion, not a great deal more than the tax money lost by the business entertainment deduction.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.21" HREF="#FN1.21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Reacting to the "Contract," Labor Secretary Robert Reich suggested that Congress end "corporate welfare as we know it," removing tax breaks for particular industries and agriculture that amount to tens of billions a year. He also noted that over a quarter of taxes go to pay interest on the national debt, most of it accumulated by the statist reactionaries of the 1980s, who played their spend-and-borrow games under the conservative disguise. Reich's speech on economic and social policy was prominently reported -- in the London <CITE>Financial Times,</CITE> though for accuracy, it did receive a few lines under "World-Wide Notes" in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal,</CITE> the same day.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.22" HREF="#FN1.22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The principles are clear and explicit: free markets are fine for the Third World and its growing counterpart at home. Mothers with dependent children can be sternly lectured on the need for self-reliance, but not dependent executives and investors, please. For them, the welfare state must flourish.

<P>Focusing on rich countries like ours is highly misleading, to put it mildly. The double-edged "free market ideology" has by far its most lethal effects in the traditional colonial domains, which, apart from the Japan-based area, are mostly an utter disaster, improving here and there only by ideologically-based economic measures that dispense with effects on people. While almost all industrial societies have become more protectionist in past years, the Reaganites generally led the pack. The effects on the South have been devastating, compounding the consequences of the IMF-World Bank structural adjustment programs, which have had a brutal impact on the poor majority while benefiting foreign investors and elite sectors linked to them.

<P>Market distortions by the rich have been a major factor in doubling the already huge gap between the poorest and richest countries in the past generation. The 1992 UN Development Report estimates that various protectionist and financial measures taken by the rich countries have deprived the South of $1/2 trillion a year, about 12 times total "aid" -- most of it publicly-subsidized export promotion. This behavior is "virtually criminal," the distinguished Irish diplomat and author Erskine Childers observed recently. He also notes that the West, under U.S. lead, blocked a 1991 resolution tabled at the General Assembly by the South against "economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries," the favored technique, apart from terror, by which the U.S. has sought to destroy such independent upstarts as Cuba and Nicaragua -- while never ceasing to sing odes to the free market. The fact is "very little known," Childers writes, "because of course such things do not get reported by the dominant Northern media." He hopes that some day this "wholesale moral abdication by Northern countries" will lead to "their utter shame before their own citizens," shame that will "start on the day when Northern academicians and NGOs" institute "a Blackmail Watch" to stand alongside the Human Rights Watches.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.23" HREF="#FN1.23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Not tomorrow, we can be sure of that.

<P>With hopelessly inadequate apologies to the victims, I'll put aside that terrible story of major crimes against humanity, for which we bear continuing responsibility.

<P>Next month, I'll turn to two topics: the specific measures that are being used to control the surplus population, and the general background against which these crimes against humanity proceed. The former include the growing "crime industry," unrelated to crime but closely related to the need to cage those growing categories of the population who have no role to play in enriching the wealthy and privileged, and therefore lack rights by "conservative" values. Another striking component is the war against families and children that was led by Reagan-Thatcher conservatives and is now to be sharply enhanced. Yet another is the effort to restore something like the Satanic Mills of the early period of industrialization, for those who retain some rights under reigning values. All of this is entirely reasonable, as major tendencies in the global economy of the past quarter century have at least raised the possibility that the world might be driven to an extreme form of totalitarian domination by wealthy and powerful sectors, with the gains for human rights, freedom, and democracy won in bitter struggle over centuries now reversed -- a shift from "containment" to "rollback," to borrow some of the (largely deceitful) terminology of foreign policy discussion.

<P>The new year opened auspiciously with the announcement of the revolutionary agenda of the "conservatives," responding to the "popular mandate" conferred by their "landslide victory" -- in which they gained 50.5 percent of the votes of the minority who took part and were overwhelmingly opposed by non-voters, while one-sixth of those who did vote regarded the outcome as "an affirmation of the Republican agenda" and one out of nine saw "a more conservative Congress" as an issue. Meanwhile large majorities, as usual, favored more government spending for domestic programs and more help for the poor, reduced military spending, and other traditional parts of the "liberal agenda" that the population had overwhelmingly repudiated, according to standard doctrine.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.1" HREF="#FN2.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>


<A NAME="SEC2.1"><H3>1. The Conservative Agenda</H3></A>

<P>The "conservatives" -- I'll adopt the term, reluctantly -- cannot be faulted for concealing what they have in mind. Their agenda hews closely to the traditional double-edged conception of markets, personal responsibility, freedom from government interference, and so on. The slogans are to be interpreted literally and harshly for everyone -- apart from the rich minority, who are exempt from such strictures. Quite the contrary. The interests of the privileged are to be enhanced by a powerful and interventionist "nanny state," which transfers vast public subsidies to them and otherwise caters to their whims. Newt Gingrich's conservative constituents in their wealthy Atlanta suburb cannot be expected to face market discipline. They must maintain their lead among recipients of public subsidies, so that they can bask in self-praise for their "independence" and "entrepreneurial values," and indulge in their "visceral distaste" for the federal government that fills their pockets with public funds -- without which, they would soon join the laggards and spongers they despise.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.2" HREF="#FN2.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Clinton's first response to the "conservative landslide" was to increase Pentagon spending, already high even by Cold War levels. He announced an increase of $25 billion over the next six years, directly contravening the public will; the Gingrich "Contract with America" calls for $60 billion. As well understood within the business community, the Pentagon is a central component of the "nanny state" -- for the rich, Gingrich's constituents in particular.

<P>The new Republican leadership opened their campaign with plans for "welfare reform." The proposals are fine-tuned to the principles of class warfare. By far the largest entitlements (among those that are mentionable, that is) are Social Security and Medicare. But benefits under these programs are not class-based: not only the poor reach retirement age. Furthermore, funding of Social Security is sufficiently regressive to make it more tolerable. These huge and rapidly growing programs are therefore not on the "conservative agenda" -- for now; as policy marches on from containment of human rights and democracy to rollback, they too are unlikely to survive, since the wealthy can prosper without them. The programs that face radical cuts are food stamps, AFDC, and Medicaid. AFDC reaches 14 million people who are destitute, 9.7 million of them children; it has declined sharply since 1970, particularly since the Reagan years. Medicaid provides health care for 33 million people who cannot afford it. Though a small fragment of officially-recognized "welfare," these programs are designed to help people who are weak and defenseless, therefore subject to market discipline and the demands of "personal responsibility."

<P>The reforms are still more finely honed. The food stamp program is likely to survive, the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reports, because it has a "middle-class constituency that includes farmers, grocers, and the food industry generally." Agribusiness, great marketing chains, and the transnationals that dominate the food industry are a "middle class constituency" with human rights. But AFDC lacks these merits. Over five million children are to be deprived of its meager support, though they "would not be harmed" by losing their subsistence, Republican House leaders assure us, because "adults on welfare will protect their children by working or getting married" -- taking jobs that do not provide a living wage (if they even exist), and marrying men who can join the surging prison population when they fail to find work.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.3" HREF="#FN2.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The planned tax cuts reveal the same refined sensibility. They are designed to benefit "the truly wealthy," the <CITE>Times</CITE> editors accurately comment, including "capital gains tax cuts and depreciation write-offs for business" that will "run the deficit up even higher," and that should properly be called transfer payments from the poor to the rich. Other tax cuts are supposedly intended to benefit "the middle class." The category includes people who earn up to $100,000 a year (more than 96 percent of taxpayers) as the President defines the term, and up to $200,000 a year (more than 99 percent of taxpayers) under the Republican definition. That means "there is almost no one left to pick up the tab," so the burden is placed overwhelmingly on the shoulders of those least able to bear it. The major "middle class" tax cut a credit for dependent children, a regressive measure that offers little or nothing to people too poor to take advantage of it. That aside, it benefits primarily the rich: "Generally, the more income that taxpayers have, the more likely they are to have dependent children," the <CITE>Times</CITE> reports: "For instance, 55 percent of taxpayers with incomes from $100,000 to $200,000 in 1991 claimed at least one exemption for a dependent," as compared with 42 percent in the $30,000-$35,000 range (close to the actual "middle class").

<P>The tax cuts too are hailed by their bipartisan advocates as a response to the popular will, which was revealed by a Harris poll after the elections. Two-thirds felt the state of the nation was not good. Their reasons varied, including high taxes -- selected by three percent.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.4" HREF="#FN2.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The "hidden welfare state" for the rich, with its huge entitlements concealed by tax deductions and other devious means, scarcely enters the debate over welfare reform. But it is by no means unaffected. "Buried in the House Republicans' `Contract with America' is a very sweet deal for the nation's big capital-intensive companies," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reported in December, reviewing an array of tax breaks and other devices that will "provide a sizable subsidy" to corporations, possibly eliminating taxable income entirely for large firms, and increasing the deficit in accord with the Reaganite version of "fiscal conservatism." The program is carefully crafted so that its impact will not be felt until 1997 -- coincidentally, after the presidential election, something we are not supposed to notice. IRS officials predict a cost to the taxpayer of over $14 billion a year by the end of the decade.

<P>Reacting to the Gingrich Contract, Labor Secretary Robert Reich gave a speech last November in which he suggested ending "Corporate welfare as we know it"; it was reported in the business press abroad, and received a few words in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> as well. The <CITE>Journal</CITE> returned to the topic a few weeks later in an article by Alan Murray on the tax breaks that "shower billions in benefits on the oil and gas, timber, cattle-breeding and real-estate industries and others," one minor component of the "nanny state" for the rich. Murray referred to "Mr. Reich's broadside against corporate welfare," noting that it "was quickly shot down by friendly fire" from the White House and Cabinet. The Administration had discussed cutting back the "$114 billion of spending over the next five years that benefits specific industries, as well as $110 billion in tax subsidies," some for single industries, some aimed at public funding of advertising and purchase of mansions (through tax subsidies). All such ideas are "going nowhere," however, and "already have been taken off the table."

<P>The mood was symbolized at the first triumphal session of the new Congress, with the Gingrich army in charge. In a "half-hearted" gesture, House Democrats sought "to embarrass Republicans for declining to include a ban on lobbyists' gifts in the new rules," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> mentioned on p. 16. There was also brief notice in the <CITE>Times,</CITE> quoting the reaction of the Commander-in-Chief himself. Gingrich said he'd "heard rumors that imply that they're just into sort of a fairly stupid strategy of cheap and nasty," which "makes one wonder just how dumb they think the American people are." Imagine how the public would react to the idea of making it harder for corporations to purchase votes in our model democracy.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.5" HREF="#FN2.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>State governments are responding to the "popular mandate" the same way. In New York, a draft proposal of Governor-elect George Pataki's administration calls for a cut of over $1 billion in Medicaid, while Mayor Rudolph Giuliani proposed a 25 percent reduction in Medicaid and other help for the poor. To better comprehend these measures, one may bear in mind that in Manhattan the income gap between rich and poor is greater than in Guatemala, and within the U.S. is surpassed only by a group of 70 households in a former leper colony in Hawaii. The gap widened in the 1980s more than in any other county with over 50,000 people.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.6" HREF="#FN2.6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The justification for such budgetary proposals is dual: the "popular mandate" that overwhelmingly opposes them, and the lack of funds. The mandate is beyond challenge: "Americans Like G.O.P. Agenda," a lead story is headlined in the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> citing data showing that 65 percent of the public believe "the Government has a responsibility to take care of the poor" while 9 percent think "programs for poor children" should be decreased. Support for a balanced budget amendment is equally impressive: "22 percent, if it would require cuts in spending on education," and comparable figures if other cuts in social spending are contemplated.

<P>Equally beyond challenge is the "fact" that there just isn't enough money available in this "lean and mean" age. Times are tough all over, particularly for the great corporations that are enjoying "dazzling" profits, <CITE>Fortune</CITE> magazine exults. Meanwhile <CITE>Business Week</CITE> worries over "The Problem Now: What To Do With All That Cash" (headline), as "surging profits" are "overflowing the coffers of Corporate America" and dividends are booming, thanks in large measure to profits from overseas operations (in the interest of "jobs for Americans"). Meanwhile the Census bureau reports that 95 percent of the population has lost income since 1989, with a 7 percent decline in median family income, continuing through the "Clinton recovery." Real hourly pay (including benefits) has fallen 1 percent a year for the median male since 1979, including the 1991-93 recovery years, labor economists Jared Bernstein and Lawrence Mishel report.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.7" HREF="#FN2.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Less delighted are city governments, which will face the problems created as federal government and the states shift benefits towards the wealthy even more than under the prevailing norms. Meeting in December, the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported that requests by needy people increased by 12 percent in 1994, requests for emergency shelter even more. 15 percent of requests for emergency food aid had to be denied, along with almost 1/4 of requests by homeless families, who remained homeless an average of 9 months. The Mayors' Conference called for an increase in federal assistance programs, responding to a different "popular mandate" than the one that is perceived by the political class and media elite: the popular mandate reflected consistently in polls but irrelevant to policy, which is "insulated from politics," to borrow a useful phrase from the London <CITE>Economist.</CITE><SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.8" HREF="#FN2.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Another target is foreign aid, "already by far the lowest of any major industrialised country as a proportion of gross domestic product," the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> observes, and virtually non-existent if we eliminate the grants to the primary recipient (Israel, a rich first world country, thanks to unprecedented subsidy from abroad) and the secondary beneficiaries, to make sure they play their role in guaranteeing U.S. control over Middle East energy reserves. Senator Mitch McConnell, who will chair the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, announced that aid should be restricted to advancing "America's security and economic interests." That is overwhelmingly true already, but the principle must be implemented more harshly still. The pennies that go to Africa, for example, serve almost no useful purpose, merely helping human beings. While aid to most countries should be cut, McConnell announced, aid to the Middle East should be increased: primarily to Israel, then to other Middle East gendarmes.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.9" HREF="#FN2.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Also facing the axe are regulatory measures, mostly unenforced by the criminal state during the Reagan years, a primary reason for the collapse of unions and the sharp rise in industrial accidents, <CITE>Business Week</CITE> reported in an important cover story. New proposals aim to reduce or eliminate such "market distortions," which merely save lives at the cost of profits. These December 1994 announcements were exquisitely timed, coinciding with new disclosures about the effects of the failure to control predatory profit-seeking. On December 19, the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> reviewed the destruction of the Georges Bank fishing grounds off the New England coast, formerly one of the world's richest. Parts had to be closed completely in mid-December, with more drastic actions anticipated, in the hope that the fish population, virtually depleted, might recover -- a vain hope, many scientists fear. After the area was closed to foreign boats by a 200-mile fishing limit declared in 1976, U.S. fishing operations nearly doubled, spurred by government tax credits. The predictable result of state subsidy and lack of regulation was to decimate populations of cod, haddock, and other major stocks. Cod may become "virtually extinct," the Northeast Fisheries Science Center predicted. New England, the traditional home of codfish, is now importing its cod from Norway. The government of Norway "took strong measures to stop overfishing years ago," following a "different philosophical tradition from North America," one that allows the government, in the public interest, to place some controls on "economic actors" (Kare Bryn, director of the resources department in Norway's fisheries ministry). The "philosophical tradition" here is quite different, allowing the government only to offer massive protection and public subsidy to business interests in accord with our deep-seated libertarian commitments.

<P>"In the 1980s," the vice-chair of the government Fishery Management Council concedes, "there was not enough conservation and too much concern about the impacts it would have" (on short-term profit, to be precise). "I think everybody regrets that now, but that's like crying over spilled milk." The regrets are revealed by the passionate dedication to dismantle what is left of the regulatory apparatus so as to maximize the scale of future tragedies.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.10" HREF="#FN2.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The day after this report was published, President Clinton announced his plans to implement the "conservative program," with cuts in government spending (apart from the Pentagon subsidy to the rich, which is to increase). The major cuts are to be in the Energy department, slowing down cleanup of nuclear waste, cutting research, and turning management of the petroleum reserve to "private enterprise" -- the term is even more of a joke than usual, in reference to the energy industry. The same day, the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reported new scientific evidence on the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming. Satellite data revealed that industrial gases are the primary factor in depletion of the ozone layer, which scientists fear might spread over northern areas; and satellites also provided the most precise data yet available on rise of the sea level, showing it to be within the range predicted by global warming models. The potential threat to human life is not trivial.

<P>Also on the same day, the staff of the House Health and Environment Subcommittee released a report reviewing tobacco industry data purporting to show that secondhand smoke is not a significant hazard in workplaces. The data had been a "significant element" in industry campaigns to bar regulation, the report observed. The data were "faked," according to workers who took the measurements. The conclusion was supported by the House committee's research staff and an independent review by a chemist at the Naval Research Laboratory. When the fakery is corrected, the hazard proves to be considerably higher. Is that a surprise, when an industry "regulates" itself? Perhaps to really dedicated commissars. Incoming chair Thomas Bliley of Virginia, "an industry champion" (<CITE>Business Week</CITE>), refused to comment.

<P>Other efforts to save lives from depredations by the rulers are also to decline under the conservative regimen. Among other consequences, the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety & Health Administration are likely to lose much of their limited effect, and pharmaceutical prescriptions may not have to provide information about safe drug use. The basic plan is to impose conditions on any regulatory statute that will be almost impossible to meet: for example, largely meaningless "cost-benefit analyses" that can be extended without limit by corporate lawyers of even limited intelligence.

<P>The human consequences are not hard to predict, but short-term profit will increase for the publicly-subsidized "private" sector of the economy. Civilization marches on.

<P>Other proposed measures lead in the same direction. One component of the current crusade is to shift such government funding as remains to the states (outside of the expanding "nanny state" for the wealthy). It is anticipated that state governments will be much more susceptible to the influence of private tyranny, which overwhelms local populations in resources and can play one against another in the time-honored fashion. An illustration, reported just as the crusade was launched, is the effect of the decision by Congress in 1991 to transfer control over transportation funds to the states. Of the $35 billion that has gone to them so far, 96 percent was used for highway projects, in violation of the intent of the legislation to support mass transit, according to the chair of the House Committee on Public Works and Transporation, Norman Mineta, one of its authors. Some attribute this "massive institutional civil disobedience" to pressures from "entrenched highway construction interests," but a look back to the huge federal social engineering projects that destroyed public transportation and "suburbanized America" in the interests of dominant components of the corporate sector suggests broader goals. President Clinton's first proposed reductions should accelerate the process. "One such cut would reduce Federal spending for highway, bridge, airport and rail infrastructure for $5 billion and give the states more discretion on spending the rest" (<CITE>NYT</CITE>): "The end result could be more potholes and higher fares for many taxpayers." One can guess, perhaps, that mass transport will end up being the primary target, as plans reach practice.

<P>The basic principles have long been familiar, and are sometimes articulated plainly enough. After a recent series of ferry disasters in the Baltic with hundreds of lives lost, the former president of Britain's Royal Institution of Naval Architects pointed out that measures to overcome the problems are well understood, but owners won't follow them "unless they are forced. You choose whether you have regulation or let thousands more people die." The stakes here are far greater, but the principle is the same. Short-term gain for the privileged few might be impaired if the welfare of the general population and future generations is taken into consideration, and under the "civilized values" that Newt Gingrich and other rollback advocates seek to instill, the relative weights are clear.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.11" HREF="#FN2.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>


<A NAME="SEC2.2"><H3>2. The Surplus Population</H3></A>

<P>When the doctrines of contemporary "neoliberalism" were crafted in early 19th century England, the message to the population was clear and simple: under capitalism, you have no rights, apart from what your labor will bring in the market. A person without independent wealth "has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is," Malthus proclaimed in highly influential work. It is a "great evil" and violation of "natural liberty" to mislead the poor into believing that they have further rights, David Ricardo held, outraged at this assault against the principles of economic science, which are as immutable as the principles of gravitation, he held, and against the moral principles on which the science rests, no less exalted. The message is simple. You have a free choice: the labor market, the workhouse prison, death, or go somewhere else -- as was possible when vast spaces were opening thanks to the extermination and expulsion of indigenous populations.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.12" HREF="#FN2.12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The doctrines are being revived, but under radically different conditions. Ricardo's "science" was founded on the principle that capital is more or less immobile and labor highly mobile. We are enjoined today to worship the consequences of Ricardo's science, despite the fact that the assumptions on which they are based have been reversed: capital is highly mobile, and labor virtually immobile -- libertarian conservatives lead the way in rejecting Adam Smith's principle that "free circulation of labor" is a cornerstone of free trade, in keeping with their contempt for markets (except for the weak). Other assumptions of the "science" are so radically false that the whole topic is hard to take seriously: among them, the abstraction from severe market distortions resulting from the centrally-managed transactions of the huge corporate structures that dominate the international economy, and the reliance on the "nanny state" that has been such a decisive factor in economic growth and the specific forms it has taken throughout history, and remains so.

<P>The science originated as a weapon of class warfare, has been adapted for similar ends over the years. It is returning to its origins today as the prospects for rollback improve, narrowing substantially the choices for the growing population who lack rights by doctrinal decision -- termed "science" or "natural law."

<P>The surplus population has to be kept in ignorance, but also controlled. The problem is faced directly in the Third World domains that have long been dominated by the West and therefore reflect the guiding values of the masters most clearly: here favored devices include death squads, "social cleansing," torture, and other techniques of proven effectiveness. At home, more civilized methods are (still) required. The superfluous population is to be cooped up within urban slums that increasingly resemble concentration camps, or if that fails, sent to prisons, the counterpart in a richer society to the death squads we train and support in our domains. Under Reaganite enthusiasts for state power, the number of prisoners in the U.S. almost tripled, leaving our main competitors, South Africa and Russia, well behind -- though Russia has just caught up, now that they are mastering the values of their American tutors.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.13" HREF="#FN2.13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The bipartisan crime bill should facilitate the process of controlling the unwanted population, with its vast new expenditures for prisons, sharp increase in the death penalty, and much harsher sentencing procedures. Again, this is an acceptable form of state action, serving the social function of population control and providing yet another Keynesian stimulus to the economy: to the construction industry, lawyers, security personnel, and so on. The public subsidy of the "crime industry" is coming to approach the scale of the Pentagon, though it is less favored: its benefits are not so sharply skewed towards the wealthy. Nonetheless, it's reasonable that Gingrich's Contract should call for expanding this aspect of the war against the general public.

<P>The crime rate has not changed significantly for twenty years, and recently has declined, if official figures can be taken seriously. The FBI reported in early December that crime rates in 1994 decreased to the lowest level since 1986 for overall crime, since 1990 for violent crime, and since 1985 for property crime (though white collar crime is only sporadically reported). But punishment has gone up fast, as the rate of incarceration shows, and in highly restricted ways, targeting the most vulnerable sectors, mainly Blacks and Latinos; the close race-class correlation in the U.S. makes the procedure only more natural. These sectors are regarded as a criminal population, one leading criminologist, William Chambliss, concludes from recent studies, including direct observation by students and faculty in a project with the Washington police. That's not exactly correct. Criminals are supposed to have constitutional rights, but as his on-the-scene studies show, these communities do not. They are effectively under military occupation. "Young Black and Latino men living in America's ghettos and barrios are under siege from, and at war with, the police," Chambliss writes.

<P>The 1994 Crime Bill is designed to increase the prison population and the costs of maintaining it, with little if any effect on crime. The "three strikes" provision ensures that people will remain in prison long past the age when criminal actions are likely, as has much research has shown; and the aging population will either require minimal (and costly) care or be left to die, in keeping with expansion of the right to kill granted to state authority under contemporary libertarian doctrine. The Crime Bill also ends funding for vocational and other training (Pell Grants), slight expenditures that markedly decrease recidivism and prison violence. Such measures make no sense as part of a "war against crime." They make a lot of sense, however, as part of a war against the population, with two aspects: removal of people superfluous for profit-making, and control of the large majority targeted for reduction of quality of life and opportunity, who must be somehow frightened into submission to authority.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.14" HREF="#FN2.14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The largely fraudulent "drug war" has served as an effective device for this population control program. Criminalization of drugs has increased crime -- including crime by government agencies from local police to the CIA -- though studies show no effect on drug availability or use, and decriminalization, where it has been tried, seems to have increased neither. In 1992, nearly 30 percent of state and over 55 percent of federal prisoners were convicted on drug charges (a third for marijuana). Two-thirds of these arrests were for possession, not sale or manufacture. One finds few executives of banks or chemical corporations in prison, though banks are surely involved in money laundering -- a banking subsidiary of American Express just paid $32 million in a settlement in a money-laundering case, with no criminal charges<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.15" HREF="#FN2.15">15</A></FONT></SUP> -- and the government estimates that more than 90 percent of the chemicals used to produce cocaine come from the United states. A Reagan-era CIA study concluded that U.S. exports of such chemicals to Latin America far exceed amounts used for any legal commercial purpose, concluding that they are diverted to heroin and cocaine production.

<P>It has been well-documented that the drug business has trailed U.S. subversive and counterinsurgency activities quite closely since the CIA helped re-establish the Mafia-run heroin racket in France after World War II as part of the program to undermine the labor movement and the anti-fascist resistance. The reasons are also too well known to recount. The latest phase, unsurprisingly, involves Afghanistan, where the U.S. spent billions of dollars through the 1980s in support of the Islamic fundamentalist extremist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who has taken the lead in tearing to shreds what remained of the shattered country after the Russian invaders withdrew. The <CITE>Far Eastern Economic Review</CITE> reports that 1994 opium production in Afghanistan is the biggest crop the world has ever seen, enabling Afghanistan and Pakistan (the base for the CIA operations) to win first place in world heroin-production, overtaking the Golden Triangle that gained that status as a by-product of U.S. subversion and aggression a generation ago.

<P>"It is now widely accepted," the <CITE>Review</CITE> reports, "that the U.S. deliberately played down heroin production by the mujahideen during these years" (1980-89), causing at least one DEA agent to resign in disgust because of the CIA's protection of known druglords. One consequence is that Pakistan, with no significant drug problem in 1980, now has perhaps as many as 2 million heroin addicts, while heroin-export earnings amount to about 20 percent of its formal exports, a UN report estimates. Most of the heroin produced ends up in the United States.

<P>The leading drug-producing center in the Western hemisphere, Colombia, gives more insight into the nature of the "drug war." The leading human rights violator in the hemisphere, Colombia also receives the most U.S. military aid, now more than half of what goes to the entire hemisphere, increasing under Clinton. The Jesuit-based Justice and Peace <CITE>Bulletin</CITE> just published a study of human rights abuses during the last year of the administration of Cesar Gaviria, Washington's favorite, recently imposed as Secretary-General of the OAS in a Washington power-play that was much resented. The general picture is horrendous, as before, but the "anti-drug strategy" is particularly relevant here. Colombia had two major cartels: Medellin and Cali. The Medellin cartel, the <CITE>Bulletin</CITE> reports, "evolved out of popular low class origins with a marked tendency to show off its wealth ostentatiously and act in a `Robin Hood'-like manner, implementing social projects in poor areas of the city and with a military apparatus separate from and threatening and aggressive towards the government," which is regarded as an enemy by much of the population. The Cali cartel, "with aristocratic upper class roots, discreet and careful to camouflage and blend its wealth in with that of the country's well-to-do industrialists and businessmen, infiltrated into all of the government's spheres of influence and power with a military apparatus allied and coordinated with government armed forces."

<P>The two cartels were accorded very different treatment. The Gaviria administration destroyed the Medellin cartel in military operations that involved massacres, large-scale torture, disappearances, and illegal arrests. The Cali cartel has had a more pleasant fate, including leaders who were "involved in horrible massacres carried out in alliance with members of the armed forces." It now enjoys "absolute territorial domination and control" in major drug-producing regions, where paramilitary groups allied with the military have established "veritable strongholds."

<P>Nevertheless, the Cali cartel is harshly treated in comparison to the leading narcotrafficking mobsters. It is conventional and convenient to externalize the issue, focusing attention on evil creatures in foreign lands who poison our children and destroy our cities. A useful corrective is offered in a study by the OECD (the organization of the wealthy industrial societies), reviewed in Mexico's main journal <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> by Apolinar Biaz-Callejas of the Andean Commission of Jurists and the Latin American Association for Human Rights. The OECD study found that "the money produced by drug trafficking throughout the world reached $460 billion in 1993, of which the U.S. received $260 billion, which is circulated through its financial system, in contraband, and through other ways. Colombia, as a producer-exporter, gets only $5 to $7 billion, or 2 to 3 percent of what remains in the U.S. The big business is, therefore, in that country," veiled in anonymity and beyond reach of law.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.16" HREF="#FN2.16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>At home, both criminal law and police practice are "blatantly racist," Chambliss concludes. Blacks constitute two-thirds of prisoners in state prisons convicted of drug offenses and 40 percent of all drug arrests, though more Whites than Blacks use illegal drugs and more than 80 percent of the population is White. Possession of a small amount of crack cocaine, the drug of choice in the ghetto, "carries a mandatory five-year prison sentence without the possibility of parole but possession of a hundred times that amount of cocaine powder (the drug of choice of the white middle class) has no mandatory sentence."

<P>While crime has not changed much in scale or character in the last twenty years, perceptions have. The perceptions did not precede and motivate government crime laws, as has been claimed by James Q. Wilson and other conservative scholars. Rather, as polls show, concerns were stimulated by right-wing political elements, primarily from the 1960s. In that period, Chambliss points out, crime could serve as "a smokescreen" to conceal other issues "as well as legitimation for legislation designed primarily to suppress political dissent and overturn Supreme Court decisions."

<P>Blacks are particularly targeted because they are defenseless and have little influence. And engendering fear is, of course, a standard method of population control, whether the chosen targets are Blacks, Jews, immigrants, homosexuals, or whatever. These are the basic reasons, it seems, for the growth of "the crime control industry." Not that crime isn't a real threat to safety and survival. It certainly is, particularly for the poor. But the problem is not being addressed; rather, used as a method of population control, in various ways.

<P>Children are also vulnerable and defenseless, hence another fit target for conservatives-on-the-march. The matter has recently been addressed in several important books, one a 1993 UNICEF study by U.S. economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett that deals with child care in rich societies, another by the Canadian writer Linda McQuaig, the #1 bestseller in Canada for 23 weeks.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.17" HREF="#FN2.17">17</A></FONT></SUP> Studying the past 15 years, Hewlett finds a sharp split between Anglo-American societies and those of continental Europe and Japan; McQuaig finds the same effect, and focuses on the consequences for Canada as it shifts towards the Reagan-Thatcher model. This model, Hewlett writes, has been a "disaster" for children and families; the European-Japanese model, in contrast, has improved their situation considerably. Both authors attribute the Anglo-American "disaster" to the ideological preference for free markets. That's only half true: whatever one chooses to call the reigning ideology, it is unfair to tarnish the good name of "conservatism" by applying it to this form of violent, lawless, reactionary statism, which despises markets almost as much as it does democracy and freedom.

<P>Causes aside, there isn't much doubt about the effects of the free market for the weak, what Hewlett calls the "anti-child spirit [that] is loose in these lands" subjected to the "neglect-filled Anglo-American model," which has largely privatized child-rearing while making it effectively impossible for most of the population. The result is a predictable disaster for children and families, while in the "much more supportive `European' model," social policy has strengthened support systems for families and children.

<P>It's no great secret. A Blue-Ribbon Commission of the National Association of State Boards of Education and the American Medical Association concluded in 1990 that "Never before has one generation of children been less healthy, less cared for or less prepared for life than their parents were at the same age" -- though only in the Anglo-American societies, where an anti-child, anti-family spirit has reigned for 15 years under the guise of "conservatism" and "family values." This is yet another triumph of the "bought priesthood," as the independent working class press referred to the intellectual servants of power a century ago, before free expression was overcome by state repression and market forces.

<P>Conservatives are not devoted only to children and families, but also to the "middle classes," which have declined under their rule to levels well below those of comparable countries (Japan, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, etc.) as society is split more sharply into rich and poor. The gap has so widened that the director of the respected Luxembourg Income Study, U.S. economist Timothy Smeeding, shocked Congress with data showing that the U.S. tolerates "a level of disadvantage unknown to any other major country on earth."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.18" HREF="#FN2.18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>New York City, mentioned earlier, happens to be an extreme case, but the pattern is quite general, and even extends to U.S. domains. Latin America is the region of traditional U.S. influence. It also has the most extreme inequality in the world, thanks in large measure to specific policies designed to prevent a form of "economic nationalism" which, it was feared, would lead to more egalitarian and independent development. The current favorites are typical in that regard, from Mexico to Argentina.

<P>Mexico's neoliberal achievements were lauded effusively until the bubble burst in recent weeks. The achievements included slow economic growth despite a huge flow of foreign assistance to make the miracle work, falling real wages, and growing inequality. The Mexican government concedes that "the number of citizens living below the poverty line has increased from 13 million in 1990 to 24 million in 1994." Closely tracking this impressive record, the number of billionaires rose from 13 in 1993 to 24 in 1994 (as compared with one in 1987). So <CITE>Forbes</CITE> magazine reported in its annual review of the "swelling roster of global billionaires" in the global economy, so short of capital that the great mass of the population must be crushed. The Mexican billionaires achieved their exalted status mostly in league with the state authorities. The biggest gift horse has been "privatization": the giveaway of public resources, "under very generous terms for investors," political economist John Summa observes with cautious understatement. Economist David Barkin adds that "the privatization of Mexico's government holdings was systematically channeled to President Salinas' `cronies,' to use <CITE>Business Week</CITE>'s expression, in a cynical abuse of the process in which it is rumored that the President himself is a major participant enjoying enormous wealth as a result of his private holdings." There is also a great inflow of foreign capital, most of it going into "short-term speculative holdings rather than into directly productive investments."

<P>In Argentina, also highly praised for its progress under World Bank tutelage, real wages dropped 30 percent since 1980, income inequality increased radically, and "the social expenditures by the public sector benefit more the upper levels of the social pyramid than the lower levels," a confidential World Bank study reported. As in Mexico, the laws of neoliberal science, still as immutable as the principles of gravitation, are functioning as they have throughout history.

<P>Among the developed societies, the top-ranking U.S. client and by far the leading recipient of U.S. aid is Israel, which also has extreme economic inequality (by First World standards). It is increasing under the neoliberal policies of the Labor government. In 1992, the number of families below the poverty line increased by over 14 percent, almost 6 percent more in 1993, now reaching about 650,000 people, 280,000 of them children. The figures include only 45 percent of Palestinian citizens, of whom over a third were below the poverty line. Uncounted also are the poor in agricultural settlements and those considered to be self-employed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.19" HREF="#FN2.19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The consistency is difficult to miss, though not to explain.

<P>Within the ideological system, it is claimed that equality and economic growth are in conflict: we choose one or the other, and our commitment to growth along the lines pioneered by our hero Adam Smith has the unfortunate consequence of engendering inequality, though all ultimately gain as wealth increases. There are a few problems with the theory. One is that equality is a significant factor contributing to growth, as is conceded even by the World Bank, despite its dedication to anti-egalitarian policies. Another is that the model that U.S. leaders have imposed abroad, and seek to duplicate as far as possible here, has led to extreme misery and impoverishment even after long "experiments" -- a rather consistent effect of the "experiments" conducted by the masters, over centuries. A third problem is that the hero at whose shrine we worship would have been appalled by the argument. A pre-capitalist thinker with roots in the Enlightenment, Smith based his argument for markets on the belief that under "perfect liberty" there would be a natural tendency towards equality, a condition for efficient market function. One can hardly say that his argument has been empirically refuted, given the extreme remoteness of "really existing capitalism" from liberty, as understood by classical liberalism.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.20" HREF="#FN2.20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A symbolic expression of the disaster for families is the fate of the International Convention on Rights of the Child, adopted by the United Nations in November 1989 and ratified by 162 countries, but not the United States -- though for fairness we should add that contemporary conservatism is catholic in its anti-child spirit. A decade ago the World Health Organization voted 118 to 1 to condemn the Nestle corporation's aggressive marketing of its infant formula in the Third World. Well aware of the likely toll in infant disease and death, the Reagan White House cast the sole negative vote, leading the way in the noble cause of free market capitalism and family values.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.21" HREF="#FN2.21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Another symbolic expression is a new line of Hallmark Greeting Cards. One, to be placed under a cereal box in the morning, reads: "Have a super day at school." Another, placed on the pillow at night, says: "I wish I were there to tuck you in." Parents aren't home, one effect of the "anti-child, anti-family spirit" engendered by double-edged "conservatism."

<P>In part, the disaster for families and children is a direct consequence of falling wages. For much of the population, both parents have to work 50-60 hours a week merely to provide necessities. And the elimination of "market rigidities" means that you work extra hours at lower wages -- or you may watch your children starve: all strictly voluntary, of course, in our free society. It doesn't take a genius to predict the consequences, and the statistics show them. Stanford University economist Victor Fuchs estimates that U.S. children have lost 10-12 hours of parental time per week between 1960 and 1986. Total contact time dropped 40 percent in the past generation, leading to deterioration of parent-child relations and family identity and values; increased reliance on TV for child supervision; "latchkey children" with rising child alcoholism, drug use, and criminality; violence by and against children; and other obvious effects on health, education, and ability to participate in a democratic society -- even survival.

<P>The conservative war against children and families is taking on a still more bitter cast with the reduction of government support for low-income housing, which declined 80 percent in real terms from 1979 to 1988, becoming "the main cause of an acute housing shortage that now stretches across the nation," Hewlett observes. The U.S. is also unusual among developed societies in not providing health care for mothers; about half of the 40,000 deaths of infants before their first birthday is attributed to lack of adequate prenatal care, more difficult to obtain today than in 1975. The U.S. "is unique in its lack of provision for childbirth," Hewlett continues, one reason why infant mortality rates are so much lower elsewhere. Rights and benefits for working parents when a child is born are also sharply restricted as compared with other rich nations. Approximately 30 percent of babies in the U.S. and 20 percent in Britain "are deprived of that precious time" that most specialists assume to be "the minimally adequate period of time for a parent to bond with a new child." Lack of job protection after childbirth is "a large part of the reason why working mothers in the United States lose from 13 to 20 per cent of their earning power after giving birth to a first child," a catastrophe for many parents in an era of falling wages, benefits, and security, and ever more onerous work demands. Day care and pre-school arrangements are also minimal by comparative standards.

<P>But things are sure to improve now that Mr. Family Values is in charge. Gingrich has not yet announced legislation to authorize state kidnapping of children of the undeserving poor for placement in orphanages, but he will "reaffirm the importance he places on family life," he said, by forming a committee that will include children and spouses of some House members "to figure out a legislative schedule more compatible with family life."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.22" HREF="#FN2.22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Some of the consequences of the war against children and families do receive a huge amount of attention, in a most enlightening way. As the 1994 election approached, major journals were lavishing attention on several new books expressing deep concern over (alleged) declines of IQ and scholastic achievement. The <CITE>New York Times</CITE> devoted an unusually long lead article in the weekly book review to several books on the topic, primarily the <CITE>The Bell Curve</CITE> by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, a book that is "being seriously compared" to Darwin's <CITE>Origin of Species,</CITE> a reviewer in <CITE>Forbes</CITE> magazine breathlessly proclaimed. The <CITE>Times</CITE> reviewer was its science writer Malcolm Browne, who opens by warning that a "government or society that persists in sweeping their subject matter under the rug will do so at its peril." There is no mention of the UNICEF study (nor have I seen one elsewhere); or of any of the numerous studies that deal with the war against children and families waged under the banner of conservatism and family values.

<P>What, then, is the question that we ignore at our peril? It turns out to be quite narrow. IQ is claimed to be genetically determined in significant measure, which will lead to a "hereditary meritocracy"; and still more ominous, linked to race, with the less intelligent breeding like rabbits and fouling the gene pool. Perhaps Black mothers don't nurture their children because they "evolved in the warm but highly unpredictable environment of Africa," the author of one of the books reviewed suggests. This is real hard science, which we ignore at our peril. But we may -- indeed must -- ignore the social policies based on free markets for the poor and state protection for the rich -- the fact, for example, that in the city where such articles appear, the richest in the world, 40 percent of children now live below the poverty line, with little hope of escape from misery and destitution. Could that have something to do with measures of IQ and achievement, or the other consequences of the war against children and families discussed in many unmentionable studies? Such questions we may readily ignore: a natural decision by the rich and powerful, addressing one another and seeking justifications for the class war they are conducting and its human effects.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.23" HREF="#FN2.23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The intensity of the effort to lend credibility to the preferred conclusions, particularly on the part of those who profess to be appalled by them, is an intriguing phenomenon. The editors of the <CITE>Times Book Review,</CITE> mostly committed liberals no doubt, selected three books on science in their annual list of "Best Books" for 1994, all devoted to a single science. The choices were so obvious that there was little dispute, they report. "The science is, broadly, evolutionary biology or specifically, sociobiology, which, once it gets into your brain, can really spook you about genetics." What "spooks you" is <I>human</I> sociobiology, not the study of complex molecules and ants, about which science actually has something to say.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.24" HREF="#FN2.24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>One choice is a memoir by Edward Wilson, "one of the founders of sociobiology" with "his seminal 1975 book `Sociobiology'" -- which has interesting material on simpler organisms, and ends with a few pages of speculations on human sociobiology. The field was actually founded 85 years earlier by the leading anarchist thinker Peter Kropotkin, also a natural scientist, in seminal work that led to his classic <CITE>Mutual Aid: a Factor of Evolution,</CITE> published in 1902. His studies criticized the conclusions on "struggle for existence" drawn by the noted Darwinian T.H. Huxley, who never responded publicly, though in private he wrote that Kropotkin's prominently-published work was "very interesting and important." Kropotkin's Darwinian speculations about the possible role of cooperation in evolution, with their implications for anarchist social organization, remain about as solid a contribution to human sociobiology as exists today. But somehow this work has not entered "the canon"; one can hardly imagine why.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.25" HREF="#FN2.25">25</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The editors' second choice is Robert Wright's <CITE>Moral Animal,</CITE> which relies on "the science of evolutionary psychology" in an effort to show that "the source of human morality is genetic." The general thesis is sure to shock anyone who thought that humans are indistinguishable from rocks and birds. Specific versions of the thesis could be interesting and important, though what evolutionary psychology has to say of any substance would hardly "spook" any rational reader.

<P>The most illuminating of the choices of the editors is the one they list first: Steven Pinker's <CITE>Language Instinct,</CITE> "which seems to doom the liberal notion that human behavior can be made better by improvements in culture and environment," a frightening conclusion indeed. What exactly is it that "dooms the liberal notion" that culture and environment influence behavior? The book reviews evidence supporting the thesis that the capacity for human language appears to be a species-property in essentials, surprisingly independent of other cognitive abilities, and a common human possession over a very broad range. As for the use of these apparently common human abilities, nothing is known beyond environmental factors (you speak English or Japanese, etc.). It is hardly in doubt that such factors also lead to striking differences in ability to make use of the abilities with which we are genetically endowed, though again, it would surprise no sane person if some genetic factor were discovered that has a detectable effect in distinguishing me from a poet -- or violinist, or quantum physicist, or auto mechanic, or anyone with skills I lack. How the editors draw their conclusions from work that offers them no particle of support, indeed undermines them to the extent that anything is understood, they unfortunately do not tell us.

<P>Also intriguing is the way the editors seek to buttress their imaginative constructions. The book, they say, "gathers data from many fields -- including cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology and speech therapy -- to demonstrate that the roots of language are in our genes," which again will come as a great shock to everyone who thought that humans were indistinguishable from rocks and birds. The author places this conclusion "firmly...in the framework of Darwinian natural selection," which has nothing to say about the topic: simply try to draw some conclusion about language from the theory. The other subjects mentioned, particularly developmental psychology, do make a contribution, but the evidence comes overwhelmingly from linguistics, as the book makes clear. That, however, lacks the proper panache for the ideological purposes at hand.

<P>It's hardly necessary to review once again the misrepresentation and elementary fallacies in the work on IQ that we ignore "at our peril," exposed years ago when the game became popular and now repackaged for today's purposes -- always eliciting much praise for the courage of the authors in lining up with the powerful and "breaking the censorship" imposed by the radical extremists who run the universities and the press. Even if we grant every factual conclusion for which some shred of evidence is claimed, nothing of interest follows, except on assumptions that reflect ideological fanaticism, not science. Specifically, the topic of "meritocracy" is not even addressed unless we grant the tacit assumption that there is something "meritorious" about the particular array of traits, perhaps partially inherited (though nothing relevant is known), that confer power and prestige under particular social arrangements: in some societies, a penchant for torture and murder; in ours, some combination of greed, cynicism, obsequiousness and subordination, lack of curiosity and independence of mind, self-serving disregard for others, and who knows what else, as reflected quite vividly by income distributions and the contributions to society at the high end.

<P>These trivialities aside, one striking finding of the studies reviewed is how poorly IQ correlates with socioeconomic status, possibly a consequence of the fact that it is designed to measure academic success, which is probably correlated only weakly with whatever it is that leads to wealth and privilege under the particular conditions of state capitalist society. If the real factors were studied, possibly better measures could be designed.

<P>One conclusion drawn is that IQ is heritable; according to <CITE>Bell Curve</CITE> author Charles Murray, 60% heritable, which means that "60 percent of the I.Q. in any given person" is "heritable." Murray's statement is meaningless, but presumably he is intending to convey the idea that 60 percent of the I.Q. of a particular individual is determined by the genes. Many others have drawn the same conclusion, based on an elementary error that has been repeatedly pointed out, among others, by Robert Wright. He correctly observes that a trait can be highly heritable whatever its genetic component; say, 100% heritable with no genetic component (whatever that means exactly; it is not a clear notion of biology). To borrow an example from Ned Block, "some years ago when only women wore earrings, the heritability of having an earring was high because differences in whether a person had an earring was due to a chromosomal difference, XX vs. XY." No one has yet suggested that wearing earrings, or ties, is "in our genes," an inescapable fate that environment cannot influence, "dooming the liberal notion."

<P>The case for group differences is no stronger, not that it would matter in a non-racist society were it true. Take the famous 15 percent deficiency in Black I.Q., which results from some interaction of genetic endowment and environment. About genetic factors that might conceivably be involved, science knows nothing. About environments, a good bit is known, in particular, about the effects of adverse and supportive environments, from the pre-natal stage on. In the absence of any relevant information about unknown genetic factors, or any serious way to measure how such factors (were they to exist, and become known) might interact with environmental conditions, the evidence presented in the <CITE>Bell Curve</CITE> is entirely compatible with the conclusion that IQs of Blacks are 15 points higher than those of Whites, or any other number one prefers on ideological grounds. Furthermore, still accepting all the factual claims, nothing follows about long-term social tendencies unless we assume that the natural state of a person is to vegetate, unless driven by transmittable material reward.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.26" HREF="#FN2.26">26</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As for Malcolm Browne's great fears, they are readily alleviated. Suppose again we grant the most ominous facts he conjures up about decline of IQ and achievement, and its causes. There's an easy solution to the problem: simply bring here millions of peasants driven from the countryside in China under the "reforms," and radically reduce Browne's income and that of his friends and associates, making sure to deprive their daughters of opportunities and education, while Black mothers are placed in Manhattan high rises and granted every advantage. Then the Asian influx will raise the IQ level; and as serious inquiry demonstrates, the fertility rate of Blacks is very likely to drop while that of the children of the journalistic elite, Harvard psychology professors, and associates of the American Enterprise Institute will rapidly rise. The problem is solved; there is nothing to fear.

<P>In part I of this series, last month, I quoted two medical researchers on the well-known fact that "development of the brain is strongly influenced by the quality of the nourishment and nurturance given to infants and children," among other effects of "adverse environments" early in life that can lead "to permanent defects in memory and learning." The scale and character of such effects is scarcely understood, but there are all too many illustrations. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FA0) predicts that "Nicaragua's next generation will be smaller, weaker, and less intelligent than today's population," Oxfam reports. Is that a sudden genetic malady? Or the effects of policies designed by people at the peak of the income distribution, exercising the high intellectual and moral standards of the "meritocracy"? Those too are questions that we may readily ignore.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.27" HREF="#FN2.27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The only interesting question about the fascination with these topics is what function it serves, a question that is -- again -- not to hard to answer.

<P>These are some of the uglier forms of population control. In the more benign variant, the rabble are to be diverted into harmless pursuits by the huge propaganda institutions, half-American, which spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year to convert people into atoms of consumption and obedient tools of production (when they are lucky enough to find work) -- isolated from one another, lacking even a conception of what a decent human life might be. That's important. Normal human sentiments have to be crushed; they are inconsistent with an ideology geared to the needs of privilege and power, which celebrates private profit as the supreme human value, demands that all submit to "economic laws," except for the wealthy, who merit special protection and care from the powerful state that they control -- a truism to Adam Smith, a "Marxist obscenity" in the intellectual world concocted by the self-styled "cognitive elite" today.

<P>I'll return in the next installment to more general commentary on background for the rollback crusade, its prospects, and the internal problems it faces.

<A NAME="SEC3.1"><H3>1. The virtual collapse of civil society</H3></A>

<P>In sections I and II (Jan., Feb.), I reviewed the latest phase of the assault on democracy and human rights that has been been gaining force for some 20 years, entering a new phase with the congressional elections of November 1994. This "landslide victory for conservatism" is supposed to have afforded Newt Gingrich's army an overwhelming "popular mandate" for the programs of their Contract with America. The mandate reached 17% of eligible voters. In the decisive House vote, 1/3 of the electorate took part, a bare majority voting for Republicans (51.3% of actual voters). The opinion profiles of the 2/3 who stayed away are virtually indistinguishable from those of Democratic voters on major issues. Only a quarter of the population had heard of the Contract a month after the election, rising to 45% after four months of intensive post-election coverage. By then, 55% had an opinion about the Commander-in-Chief of the victorious army; of those, 22% had a favorable opinion, less than half the approval for the much-disliked President, though his ratings increased through February as the highly unpopular Contract was being implemented.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.1" HREF="#FN3.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Nonetheless, fabricated landslides and mandates aside, there is no doubt that the assault against democracy and rights has accelerated, in ways that are significant and ominous. And one cannot take too much comfort from the radical opposition between attitudes and policies. The facts are known only to those who read the small print, and an impression of overwhelming support is being conveyed. The effects will be to change individual attitudes that receive no social support; few want to stand "alone against the popular will." With the virtual collapse of civil socity and the lack of a significant organized counterforce, the "mandate" that is fabrication today is likely to be reality tomorrow. 

<P>In announcing the Clinton Doctrine in late 1993, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake borrowed some standard Cold War terminology, announcing a transition from <I>containment</I> of the "global threat to market democracies" to <I>enlargement</I> of "their reach." The Cold War term for enlargement was <I>rollback,</I> official policy from 1950. The new doctrine, then, continues the old. Throughout the Cold War, the domestic populations of the industrial societies, including the United States, were a prime target for "containment." The doctrinal framework does correspond to historical reality, but only under familiar translations. "Democracy" is to contained, restricted to "top-down forms" that keep "traditional structures of power" intact at home and abroad, as the more candid acknowledge. Politics must remain "the shadow cast on society by big business," to borrow John Dewey's formulation of Adam Smith's truisms about "the principal architects of policy." As for "markets," what will be "enlarged" is the traditional double-edged doctrine: market discipline for the poor and weak, state protection and intervention (in the economy, and the world) for the benefit of those who cast the shadow -- "the masters of mankind," in Smith's phrase.

<P>Restating the Doctrine without equivocation, the masters have long sought to <I>contain</I> popular struggles to expand the range of meaningful democracy and human rights, but now perceive that they can do better. They feel, perhaps rightly, that they can dismantle the social contract that has been in some measure achieved, rolling back the threat posed by the "great beast" that keeps trying "to plunder the rich" (Alexander Hamilton and John Foster Dulles, speaking for a host of others). The architects of policy can move on to establish a utopia of the masters based on the values of greed and power, in which privilege is enhanced by state power and the general population lack rights apart from what they can salvage on a (highly flexible) labor market. They are also free to starve or to enter the rapidly expanding workhouse prisons.


<A NAME="SEC3.2"><H3>"Tough Love"</H3></A>

<P>The <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE>'s review of economic performance for the last quarter of 1995 is headlined: "Companies' Profits Surged 61% on Higher Prices, Cost Cuts." After-tax profits rose 62% from 1993, up from 34% for the third quarter. In a full-page ad, a leading lender, the CIT Group, announced proudly that "Corporate America Posted Record Profits In 1994." The headline in <CITE>Business Week</CITE> read: "It Doesn't Get a Lot Better than This." Its survey estimated profits to be up "an enormous 41% over [1993]," despite a bare 9% increase in sales, a "colossal success," resulting in large part from a "sharp" drop in the "share going to labor," though "economists say labor will benefit -- eventually." The masters aren't fooled.

<P>1993 had been a banner year for business with "dazzling" profits for the <CITE>Fortune</CITE> 500 despite stagnant sales growth. 1994 was a great improvement, yielding "surging profits" that were "overflowing the coffers of Corporate America," <CITE>Business Week</CITE> exulted even before the grand news about the final quarter was in. Meanwhile median wages and work conditions continued their steady decline. The number of children under 6 living in poverty reached a record high of 6 million, 26 percent of that age group, an increase of 1 million from 1987 to 1992 and almost double the figures for 1972 when the rollback crusade was in its early stages.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.2" HREF="#FN3.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It therefore follows as night follows day that social policies must be modified to enrich the suffering masses of Corporate America still further while the rest are taught stern lessons about the rigors of this "lean and mean" age. And so we see day-by-day as the story unfolds.

<P>The President's first response was to increase the Pentagon budget, the leading form of welfare for the rich. Unaware of the "mandate" it has conferred, the public is strongly opposed. Military spending is "near the bottom of the public's wish list," <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> polling director Richard Morin observes, with only 1/6 favoring an increase (in contrast, about 2/3 favored more spending on education, drug addiction programs, the environment, and other social spending which is to be sharply cut). In real dollars, the Pentagon budget is $30 billion a year higher than under Nixon, at about 85% of the Cold War average. The Cold War enemy is, of course, now an ally, even in military production: thus its advanced research programs enabled the U.S. to regain the world lead in pulsed power and microwave weaponry, the prestigious military journal <CITE>Jane's Defence Weekly</CITE> reported in January. The figures give some indication of how large "the threat to market democracy" posed by the Great Satan loomed in the eyes of planners who sought to "contain" it and "roll it back."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.3" HREF="#FN3.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Republican majority in Congress was not satisfied with this radical opposition to the public will, particularly the Speaker of the House, who represents the Lockheed Corporation and other high tech industries and has had unparalleled success in using the federal government to transfer public funds to his wealthy constituents. Under his leadership, the House approved a $3.2 billion "emergency" supplement for the starving Pentagon. The funds are to be drawn from programs for the vast majority. In a vain and pallid gesture that highlights what is at issue, House Democrats proposed in committee to replace a planned $5-$7 billion of cuts in child nutrition, housing, and job training by a five-year delay in deployment of Lockheed F-22 advanced fighters, a welfare program now estimated at $72 billion. The suggestion was summarily rejected, and scarcely reported.

<P>The word to use remains "security," not "subsidy," as Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington advised in the early days of the Cold War, when government was being mobilized as the "savior" of private power, which could not survive in a competitive economy, as the business press frankly acknowledged. And once again, current plans for "defense" are designed so as to foster security threats. A minor one is the Soviet Union; though now an ally, it remains a potential threat to U.S. "preponderance," the currently fashionable term for global rule. But the primary threat is "Third World weapons proliferation," Air Force Director of Science and Technology General Richard Paul informed <CITE>Jane's.</CITE> We must maintain military spending and strengthen the "defense industrial base" because of "the growing technological sophistication of Third World conflicts," the Bush Administration had explained to Congress while watching the Berlin Wall collapse, taking with it the most efficient pretext for "subsidy." No one who has kept their eyes on the "security system" will be surprised to learn that both threats are to be enhanced.

<P>Some of the funding for the emergency Pentagon supplement is to be drawn from programs to help dismantle and safeguard the nuclear arsenals of the former USSR. To protect ourselves from the resulting threat, we will have to "increase the Defense Department's budget," Florida Democratic Representative Pete Peterson commented. Furthermore, "Third World weapons proliferation" is to be stimulated, with new contributions to its "growing technological sophistication." The U.S. share in arms sales to Third World countries has reached almost three-quarters. We must therefore provide them with even more advanced weaponry, so that we can tremble in proper fear. Sale of F-16 aircraft with taxpayer-subzidized loans allows the Air Force to pay Lockheed to upgrade the aircraft and to develop the F-22 to counter the threat they pose. The welfare programs extend beyond Gingrich country, General Paul emphasized, outlining the commitment "to spin dual-use [Science & Technology] outside the military" in "the national interest," "enhancing our economic security." Particularly "enhanced" is the welfare of corporate America, which is to "transition our work," General Paul continued in standard bureaucratese.

<P>Gingrich's favorite cash cow understands the scam perfectly. Lockheed propaganda warns that it is a "dangerous world" in which "sophisticated fighter airplanes and air defense systems are being sold" -- mostly by its "savior." One of the authors adds: "We've sold the F-16 all over the world; what if [a friend or ally] turns against us?" To fend off that threat, we have to sell potential adversaries still more advanced weapons, and to transfer still more public funds to the shrinking sectors of the population that bear the burden of "dazzling" profits. Quite simple, really.

<P>Arms sales to undemocratic countries -- virtually all the recipients -- are opposed by a mere 96 percent of the population, so these programs reflect the "popular mandate" even better than their companions.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.4" HREF="#FN3.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The National Security State is a natural favorite of the advocates of private tyrannies. The device facilitates the transfer of public funds to advanced industry and to wealthy sectors generally, with the public cowering in fear of foreign enemies so that planners can operate in "technocratic insulation," in World Bank lingo. Furthermore, the "great beast" has to be dealt with somehow, and the natural device is to frighten them. With internal enemies as well; it is only reasonable that the directors of the Contract should expand further the domestic security system organized and conducted by the powerful state they wish to nurture, passing legislation permitting warrantless searches (considered a "bad idea" by 69% of those who conferred "the mandate").<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.5" HREF="#FN3.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>While the important people are receiving the care they deserve from their nanny state, social programs are being radically cut. Here the word to use is not "security," but "welfare dependence." The poor are to be helped to escape this grim fate, imposed upon them by a failed liberalism. The only problem with the story is the facts. As discussed in earlier articles, official "welfare" has sharply declined. The average monthly benefit level dropped from $714 in 1970 to $510 in 1980 and $394 in 1993 (1995 dollars), Marc Breslow observes. The one exception is health care for the poor (Medicaid), which has risen (though more slowly than general health care costs) in large part as a result of the gross inefficiencies of the privatized system with its huge administrative and bureaucratic burdens, public funding of profits, salaries, and advertising, and now micromanagement of doctors to ensure minimal care and transfer of choice from doctor and patient to fat cats in insurance company offices.

<P>The correlation between welfare payments and family life is real, though it is the reverse of what is claimed. As support for the poor has declined, unwed birthrates, which had risen steadily from the 1940s through the mid-1970s, markedly increased. "Over the last three decades, the rate of poverty among children almost perfectly correlates with the birthrates among teenage mothers a decade later," Mike Males points out: "That is, child poverty seems to lead to teenage childbearing, not the other way around." As discussed in part II of this series, the dramatic impact of the war against children and families by Reagan-Thatcher "conservatives" has been well studied, but equally well concealed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.6" HREF="#FN3.6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Facts are irrelevant when there is serious business at hand: right now, intensified class war. Among the programs targeted for elimination or radical reduction are school lunches, job training, education generally, assistance to homeless and veterans, fuel and health care for the needy, drug-free schools, conversion of military industry to human needs -- and generally, anything that might help the undeserving majority. That's doubtless in response to the fact that about 80% of the population think "government has a responsibility to try to do away with poverty," up from 70% when the "great society" programs were initiated 30 years ago, to enter into sharp decline shortly after.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.7" HREF="#FN3.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Representative Clay Shaw, Chair of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, explained that the proposals to punish millions of poor children are really "tough love," a compassionate effort to save them from dependence on the dole. The programs do not pass without criticism. <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reporter David Rosenbaum observes that "however worthy the goals and however sensible the principles" that inspire "tough love," these efforts to raise up the poor and needy face "seemingly intractable contradictions" -- primarily impediments of the kind just reviewed, which remain unmentioned.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.8" HREF="#FN3.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Jingoism is also in style. Clinton agrees that the U.S. must lower its share of UN peacekeeping operations but his right-wing adversaries want to go much further, shackling or even ending them. As for the irrelevant public, well over 80% favor UN peacekeeping operations. Half consistently support U.S. participation, 88% if there are fair prospects of success; 5-10% consistently oppose such operations, the remainder varying with circumstances. The effect of fatalities in Somalia was slight. Asked their general reaction if dead American soldiers were shown on TV, 57% favored increasing U.S. forces or striking back. Two-thirds favored contributing U.S. troops to a UN operation to protect "safe havens" or to stop atrocities in Bosnia; 80% took the same position with regard to Rwanda, if the UN concluded that genocide was underway.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.9" HREF="#FN3.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Along with "security" and "welfare dependence," the magic words include "devolution" and "states' rights." Programs that might help people are not only to be cut, but also handed over to the states in block grants. Under conditions of relative equality, this could be a move towards democracy. Under existing circumstances, devolution is intended as a further blow to the eroding democratic processes. Major corporations, investment firms, and the like, can constrain or directly control the acts of national governments and can set one national work force against another. But the game is much easier when the only competing player that might remotely be influenced by the "great beast" is a state government, and even middle-sized enterprise can join in. The shadow cast by business can thus be far darker, and private power can move on to greater victories in the name of freedom; another triviality that appears unworthy of comment.

<P>The Way it Works is described in a lead article in the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> business section headed "Line grows longer for state aid," putting the "business-friendly administration" of Gov. William Weld "in a bind." Private enterprises ranging from big-timers like Raytheon, long dependent on the public dole, to sports teams, banks, financial services and insurers, and others, are threatening to move elsewhere unless they receive "big wage and benefit concessions" from unions and millions of dollars worth of gifts disguised as "breaks on taxes and utility bills." An accompanying story describes how the truly powerful operate. It reports Microsoft magnate Bill Gates's boast that he had delivered an ultimatum to Vice-President Gore warning that he would move the whole operation elsewhere unless Washington settled an anti-trust suit in his favor.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.10" HREF="#FN3.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The richest city in the world, with the help of the state government, hopes to lead the pack. New York Governor Pataki announced a budget plan that will "reduce the top tax rate 25 percent and save taxpayers $6.8 billion a year," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reported. The first part is true, particularly for the rich; for families with incomes over $150,000, the tax reduction is seven times as high as for those with incomes under $25,000. But the "savings for the taxpayer" are a mirage. One such "saving" is a cut of $128 million next year in appropriations for the metropolitan area public transit system, tacked on to a $113 million cut in city financing. These "savings" will make a 25-cent to 50-cent increase in the already ridiculously high fares "virtually inevitable," transit advocates estimate -- "a tax hike for the more than four million moderate-income and working people" of the city, they add correctly, and a huge and radically regressive one. Among other effects, the "savings" remove fare reductions for schoolchildren, yet another regressive tax.

<P>Further "savings to the taxpayer" include reduction of support and health care for the blind and disabled, children, and defenseless people generally; firing workers who merely provide services to the general public; sharp increases in tuition at city and state universities; cancellation or delay of desperately needed infrastructure repair; doubling up of prisoners in maximum security prisons; and elimination or sharp reduction of the meager assistance to pregnant women on welfare, home care services for the elderly and disabled, pensions, cleanup of Love Canal, assistance for single adults with children "considered employable" -- perhaps in the satanic mills that are springing up throughout the city; and on, and on. It will be "a giant leap toward economic growth," the president of the Business Council of New York State exulted, perhaps thinking of those great Caribbean vacations and evenings at luxury restaurants and the theater (deductible as business expenses) and other opportunities that will be afforded by the huge redistribution programs towards the needy rich in a city that has already surpassed Guatemala in the inequality derby.

<P>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani lost no time in showing that he too knows how to serve the powerful. "Embracing the philosophy of Gov. George E. Pataki's austere budget for the state," the <CITE>Times</CITE> reported, the Mayor will "reduce for the first time public assistance and health care for the city's poorest residents" and "restructure government in ways that would affect virtually every New Yorker, although not evenly" -- a masterpiece of understatement. "In addition to the [general] cuts in welfare and health care," the Mayor called on workers to agree to "savings" in "health care, pensions and work rules." Sanitation services are a prime target. They don't benefit the folks in the high rises, and the effects should not be too much of an annoyance as their limousines pass by decaying trash and rotting people. Also to be cut are assistance to foster parents and preventive services for families considered to pose risks of child abuse. That makes good sense as a component of the war against children and families that has been waged with unremitting intensity by the "family value" conservatives in the past 15 years.

<P>In these lean and mean times, it would be unfair to target only the general population. Hence along with sharp reduction of programs that might benefit the general population, there will also be reduction in "property taxes on coops and condos, as well as reductions in business taxes" -- so everyone shares in the suffering. Municipal hospitals and health services will close, and public education will deteriorate still further, all "to stimulate job growth," the report continues with a straight face.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.11" HREF="#FN3.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>For unexplained reasons, the rising tax burden on poor and working people through fare increases and other regressive measures, though plainly reducing their purchases of goods, does not affect the jobs of those who might otherwise produce them. In contrast, job growth is stimulated by transfer of wealth to the rich for purchase of Mercedes limousines and elegant yachts, rich profits from speculation in the "economic miracle" of the Mexican economy (secured by the taxpayer, when it predictably goes sour), shifting of production to semi-slave economies maintained by U.S.-backed violence abroad, and other such free market miracles. The mysteries of economic science are profound indeed.

<P>Not all programs are to be axed, however. One public agency is to receive more money under the Giuliani budget: the police department, which will gain $100 million. That too makes sense, as part of the general enhancement of state power and violence. The rich have to be protected from the effects of the programs to turn New York into a typical Third World city.

<P>At the federal level, some programs are also safeguarded. Over three-fourths of federal food spending goes for food stamps, and that program is slated to keep federal guarantees, for reasons explained quietly by the <CITE>Wall St. Journal</CITE>: the food stamp program is backed by "big agri-business associations," so there is no place for "tough love" here. "We want one program at least to be a safety net for people who are truly needy," Rep. Pat Roberts of Kansas explained as the House Agriculture Committee that he chairs decided to impose federal requirements for the food stamp program. "That's the best way to achieve our goals of providing nutrition for the hungry and eliminating fraud from the program," Roberts continued. "It is a more pragmatic approach to achieve several of our goals." Republicans were "uneasy" about block grants that would "give governors cash rather than give poor people coupons for food," the <CITE>Journal,</CITE> noting that "grocery chains and the agribusiness lobby" were also "uneasy." Federal guarantees, in this case, will best preserve "a safety net for needy people." The reason for the decision, <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reporter Robert Pear added, is that House Republicans "feared that it would increase fraud and abuse" if governors were given grants, in this single case. Surely nothing else could have been on their minds -- for example, the fact that Roberts's congressional district received more farm subsidies over the last decade than any other, over $.5 billion a year, with Kansas farmers averaging $20,000 to $30,000 annually. Those are <I>averages</I>; the "agri-business associations" mentioned in the small print do not represent small farmers trying to scrape by. The likely outcome will put limits on the program so that it cannot meet the needs of the hungry during periods of economic decline but will offer steady guarantees to agri-business, and leave discretion in the hands of states, so that local powers can determine who are the "worthy poor" -- not including mothers who merely care for children, refusing to "work."

<P>Much as in totalitarian states, satirists are given greater latitude to articulate what everyone knows. In the <CITE>Boston Globe,</CITE> the text of a Steve Wasserman cartoon reads: "We planned to eliminate food stamps, but then we took pity. We couldn't bear the hungry cries, the outstretched hands of agribusiness lobbyists."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.12" HREF="#FN3.12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>One must admire the delicate touch of the statist reactionaries fine-tuning the transfer programs. Unlike food stamps, the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program is to be turned over to states as block grants. One reason is again explained by the <CITE>Wall Street Journal.</CITE> This transfer repeals a "cost-containment competitive bidding measure" that placed onerous market conditions on the four pharmaceutical companies that sell infant formula. They "stand to gain as much as a billion dollars" a year over and above the successes of their evasions of the federal law, now being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission. Note that taxpayers will save money with the FTC investigation terminated. The new protection for the rich from market discipline should overcome other defects of the WIC program. A USDA study found that every dollar spent brought up to $3.90 reduction of Medicaid costs for newborns and mothers. It also found a 22% drop in neonatal deaths among WIC participants. The effects of restriction of the program and transfer of its benefits to pharmaceutical companies are obvious without comment, among them, the mental and physical harm to surviving children of low-income pregnant women deprived of sustenance, which will improve the grim bell curve that condemns all but the "cognitive elite" to servitude, as yet another "science" shows.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.13" HREF="#FN3.13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Malnourished neonates and children deprived even of school lunches have no lobby working for them. Nor do the great majority of the population. Over 80 percent of the population say that "working people" have too little influence, but the shadow cast by business ensures that they can do nothing about it except watch in dismay and unfocused anger as they sink into decline. Unlike the peasants and slum-dwellers of Haiti, who were able to create a civil society rich and vibrant enough to establish a functioning democracy, people here are lost and hopeless -- a fact that sheds light on the standard propaganda line that we have to teach democracy to Haitians. But although 80% feel that working people have too little influence, only 20% feel that way about labor unions while twice that number feel that unions have too much influence. These figures reflect yet another remarkable victory for corporate propaganda.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.14" HREF="#FN3.14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The human consequences of the "savings" are immediate. Take elimination of home heating aid for the poor, which had reached over 5 million households. 72% have incomes below $8000 and spend over 18% of that on energy costs (4% for average middle-class families). Even with federal aid, half the families had used up the allocation before Christmas in 1993, and by mid-January, twice as many had died from the cold wave as in the Los Angeles earthquake. Boston City Hospital researchers found that among children treated in the emergency room (the "national health service" for the poor), the percentage suffering malnutrition almost doubled in the winter. The new measures will not only harm or kill more children, but are also a useful blow to communities. The oil vendors working with the program were mostly small businesses, often multilingual community people. So the threat of democracy is rolled back another notch.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.15" HREF="#FN3.15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Another target is public broadcasting, financially trivial but an important part of the campaign to mobilize some public support by a show of "populism" on the part of those who are happily grinding the public under foot. The propaganda campaign to depict the public system as "liberal" and "elitist" is familiar. It is unclear whether it has had much effect. A recent poll finds that over 3/4 of the population want to keep the limited public funding. But the idea that any element of the information system might remain within a potentially democratic system has always been galling to the totalitarian mentality, so despite its marginality, it may disappear.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.16" HREF="#FN3.16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Also slated for demolition is the regulatory apparatus, which only protects health, safety, welfare, and lives -- now and for future generations. The measures proposed carry more immediate costs: "at least $250 million annually" to enforce the complex provisions, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, largely to pay more bureaucrats. Clinton is joining the parade. His plans to rescind legislation that prevented banks from relying on federally-guaranteed funds for speculation were wonderfully timed. This proposal for "eliminating the legal and regulatory barriers among financial industries" was announced in a front-page <CITE>New York Times</CITE> story alongside the news that even the strict regulatory system of quasi-fascist Singapore had collapsed, destroying Britain's most venerable merchant bank -- a coincidence that is "ironic," the lobbyist for smaller banks observed. These measures are also expected to concentrate extraordinary resources in a small number of super-powerful banks and investment firms, another contribution to "free markets." The Barings collapse is just another in a series of recent disasters, including Kidder Peabody, Orange County, Procter & Gamble, Metallgeschaft, and Mexican casino capitalism. The costs will be paid by the usual victims.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.17" HREF="#FN3.17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It hasn't been easy for commentators to deal with recent developments. One problem has been to reconcile the concept of a "popular mandate" with the unmistakeable fact that the public strenuously opposes it almost every step of the way, and to preserve the doctrine that Congress, like the White House, is dedicated to serving the public good. Richard Berke's February 28 <CITE>New York Times</CITE> report, already cited, concedes that the public "doubts key parts of the G.O.P.'s agenda," giving (very partial) evidence, but explains that Congress implements the programs that the public despises "based on their reading of public sentiment." Congress has failed to notice what the polls have consistently demonstrated. The doctrinal system permits accusations of imbecility, but not of rational service to dominant powers. Adam Smith's honesty would be damned as a "conspiracy theory," were anyone so bold as to reiterate it.

<P>Some keep trying to conceal the obvious. Thus we find articles with such headlines as "Poll finds GOP agenda is popular," reporting that only 40% of Americans have even heard of the Contract with America and scarcely a third "approve of Gingrich's performance." But, the report in the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> continues, some components of the program are "overwhelmingly popular," specifically term limits for Congress, a balanced budget amendment, and welfare reform. Unmentioned is the fact that term limits were quickly shelved; advocacy of a balanced budget declines to small minorities if it entails cuts in social programs, as of course it does; and while the public does oppose "welfare," having been fed wild tales about "welfare queens," it strongly supports increased help for the poor.

<P>Sometimes the facts even appear in stories framed to confirm the official line. A lead front-page story in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> in mid-December informs us that "Americans Like G.O.P. Agenda." Reading on, we find data, which show quite the opposite: about 2/3 "say the Government has a responsibility to take care of the poor" while a mere 9% support a decrease in "programs for poor children," one of the major planks of the "G.O.P. Agenda." On the balanced budget, which is alleged to have overwhelming popular backing, the polls showed that the percentages were 22%, 27%, 30% if cuts are required in spending on education, Medicare, and Social Security, respectively -- as they would of course be. In brief, Americans Dislike G.O.P. Agenda." The real world, however, quickly disappeared. By the time the balanced budget amendment hit the front pages in late February, the issue had been reduced by government-media fiat to social security, with the crucial issue of general social spending and popular feelings about the matter completely suppressed in favor of meaningless claims that the public favors the amendment (if nothing is touched). The <CITE>Times</CITE> correspondent responsible for analysis of the issue, David Rosenbaum, rails about the "nonsense" produced by the politicians who are avoiding "substance," and proceeds to avoid the substance entirely, allowing himself only a mention of military spending and social security. Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry explains how hard it was for him to vote against the amendment "when 80% of the population are saying `Do something'": namely, don't pass an amendment that will require cuts in soical spending. Without any counterforce to the manufacture of consent, however, image will become reality, and the Republicans should to be able to use the overwhelming public opposition to their actual stand on this issue as a powerful propaganda weapon.

<P>Point-by-point, large majorities oppose specific programs that are being implemented, with rare (and interesting) exceptions. One can only speculate as to how people would react were they to read small items in the <CITE>Wall St. Journal</CITE> spelling out the consequences of the GOP "vow to ease the burden of estate and gift taxes, which they say are especially onerous for small businesses and family farms" -- and which the top tax official of the Treasury Department calculates will cut over $20 billion in tax receipts in ten years, benefitting about half of 1% of estates -- the richest.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.18" HREF="#FN3.18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The problems of reconciling fact with doctrine arise in the international arena as well. It was well-nigh impossible to conceal the fact that the highly-touted Mexican "economic miracle" on which the NAFTA propaganda campaign was founded was utter fraud, as was well-known to anyone with even a casual interest in the topic. Recall that this was the "prize example" of the miracle of the market according to the World Bank and IMF, the economics profession, the elite media, and other experts. Also difficult to handle is the fact that the U.S. taxpayer is assigned the responsibility of paying off speculators making a mint on the highly risky fraud; they are not expected to pay the costs under "free enterprise" any more than their S&L colleagues. To steer through this maze takes some ingenuity. Thus under the headline "Socializing Risk to Foster Free Markets," <CITE>New York Times</CITE> thinker Paul Lewis recognizes that the circumstances might lead some "to be cynical about a mechanism that would effectively provide insurance" for the rich in case things go wrong, but a more serious look shows that if Mexico had defaulted, the crisis "might have undermined the free-market-based development model that has become this decade's economic signature tune" -- for the commissar class, at least. In fact, both the Mexican "miracle" for speculators, investors, and a few billionaires milking public resources, and the way the risks were "socialized," are typical examples of "really existing free markets."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3.19" HREF="#FN3.19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<A NAME="SEC4.1"><H3>Towards a Utopia of the Masters</H3></A>

<P>The economic crisis for the general population is a global one. In the past 20 years, economic growth has fallen well below the levels of the 1950s and 1960s (which were, to be sure, historically unique). World per capita income fell in 1993 for the fourth straight year, while the unemployment situation, already grim, worsened in most countries. The International Labor Organization (ILO), in its World Employment 1995 report, "Predicts Rising Global Joblessness," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reports, noting however that "many management theorists" regard the analysis as outdated because "the whole concept of a job -- steady work at steady pay from the same employer -- must be discarded." The only major exception to the growing catastrophe of global capitalism is East and Southeast Asia, with the exception of the Philippines -- incidentally, the sole part of the fastest growing economic region of the world that has been under tight U.S. control for a century and (coincidentally) resembles the Latin American disaster area.

<P>Japan's former colonies have resumed the rapid economic growth of the colonial period; though a brutal imperial power, Japan treated its colonies quite differently from the Western norm. Within the region dominated by Japan and the overseas Chinese financial network, states have been powerful enough to organize capital as well as to control labor. Unlike the rest of the South, they have not been encumbered by what economic historian Paul Bairoch calls the most extraordinary myth of "economic science": "It is difficult to find another case where the facts so contradict a dominant theory than the one concerning the negative impact of protectionism," he writes, reviewing much of the record though considerably understating the significance of state intervention for the wealthy, because he limits himself to a narrow category of market interferences. The conclusions, of course, have been understood by the architects of policy, which is why they have progressed while those subjected to their whims have suffered.

<P>The official tale is that the Japan-based region is passionately dedicated to markets. We even read that "talk of labor standards enrages many export-oriented countries in Asia"; the term "countries" here refers, for example, to the brutal and corrupt rulers in Indonesia's developmental state, but not to the working people courageously struggling for the right to organize and demanding labor standards. In internal discussion, we find greater honesty. Thus a Federal Reserve report attributes Singapore's economic growth to a domestic "forced savings" policy and other state action.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.1" HREF="#FN4.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Unemployment remains higher in Europe than in the U.S., but as the ILO and others observe, that fact has to be placed in the context of the much harsher conditions of work in the United States and the reduced social contract generally. While the U.S. work week is reaching postwar peaks, the battle for a 40-hour week having been lost long ago, in Europe it has fallen to 38-39 hours, with much longer holidays and leaves and more benefits. To take just one case, until 1993 the U.S. was one of the very few countries in the world that did not provide for statutory maternity leave, and its provisions still fall far below the European standard -- in fact below the agreement negotiated by plantation workers in <I>Uganda,</I> which grants male workers seven days of paternal leave. The same picture is revealed by ratification of ILO conventions guaranteeing labor rights. The U.S. has by far the worst record in the Western hemisphere and Europe, with the exception of El Salvador and Lithuania. It does not recognize even standard conventions on child labor and the right to organize.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.2" HREF="#FN4.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The major factors that have led to the global economic crisis are well understood. One is the globalization of production, which has offered the masters tantalizing opportunities. The business press frankly warns the "pampered Western workers" that they must abandon their "luxurious life styles" and such "market rigidities" as contracts, pensions, health and safety in the workplace, and other outdated nonsense, even the very concept of a job. Economists talk of job flow, pointing out that it is hard to estimate -- and also largely beside the point. The <I>threat</I> suffices to force working people to accept employers' demands. The end of the Cold War, returning most of Eastern Europe to its traditional Third World service role, places new weapons in the hands of the rulers, as the business press has reported with unrestrained glee. GM and VW can shift production to the restored Third world in the East, where they can find workers at a fraction of the cost of the "pampered Western workers," meanwhile enjoying high tariff protection and the other amenities that "really existing free markets" provide for the rich. The U.S. and U.K. are leading the way in grinding down working people and the poor, but others will follow along, thanks to the globalization of production. Inequality is back to the depression days in the U.S., back to Victorian times in England, though Latin America still wins the prize for worst record in the world, thanks to our kind tutelage over many years.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.3" HREF="#FN4.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As many studies have shown, relative equality is a significant factor in economic growth and improvement in health and living standards. The fact is recognized by the World Bank, but without influencing the policies that it and its IMF associate impose on the Third World, which dramatically increase inequality and undermine other factors that the Bank identifies as essential for growth, notably education and welfare. There is ample historical precedent. For over 200 years, "experiments" have been conducted by the powerful following the highest principles of economic science, with startlingly uniform results: benefits for the experimenters and their power base, tragedies for the experimental animals. Right-thinking people, again, are to draw no conclusions.

<P>A second factor in the general crisis is the huge explosion of unregulated financial capital since the Bretton Woods system was dismantled by Richard Nixon and the radical change in its constitution. Daily turnover on foreign exchange markets may be approaching $1 trillion, some estimate. In the early 1970s, about 90% of capital in international exchanges was for investment and trade, 10% for speculation. By 1990, those figures had reversed, and a 1993 estimate is that only 5% is related to "real economic transactions" (Wilfried Guth of the Deutsche Bank, who argues further that these processes are undermining free trade, as do others). The consequences were understood early on. In his 1978 presidential address to the American Economics Association, Nobel laureate James Tobin suggested that taxes be imposed to slow down speculative flows, which, if unimpeded, would drive the world towards a low-growth, low-wage economy, with booming profits as well. By now, the point is widely recognized; a commission headed by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, attributes about half of the 50% decline in growth rates since the early 1970s to the huge growth of currency speculation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.4" HREF="#FN4.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The world is being moved by state-corporate policy towards a kind of Third world model, with sectors of great wealth, a huge mass of misery, and a large superfluous population, lacking any rights because they contribute nothing to profit-making for the rich.

<P>These developments are commonly attributed to inexorable market forces. Analysts then divide over the contribution of various factors, primarily trade and automation. But the discussion cannot sensibly proceed without recognition of major interferences with markets. Huge state subsidy and intervention have always been required to make trade appear efficient, not to speak of ecological costs imposed on future generations who do not "vote" in the market, and other "externalities" consigned to footnotes. To mention merely one slight market distortion, a good part of the Pentagon budget has been devoted to "secure flow of oil at reasonable prices" from the Middle East, "overwhelmingly the preserve of the United States" (Phebe Marr of the National Defense University) -- a contribution to the "efficiency of trade" that rarely receives attention, apart from other contributions to "the health of the economy." There are plenty of others.

<P>As for automation, it surely contributes to profit at some point, but that point was reached by decades of protection within the state sector, as David Noble has shown. Furthermore, the specific form of automation designed within the state system was often driven by considerations of power more than profit or efficiency; it was designed to deskill workers and subordinate them to management, not because of market principles or the nature of the technology, but for reasons of domination and control.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.5" HREF="#FN4.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Such contributions to private power give further insight into the attractiveness of the military system for modern state capitalism, particularly its appeal to "conservatives," who are commonly in the lead in demanding that markets be undermined for class interests. Reaganite America and Thatcher's England are the primary recent examples -- both paragons of "conservatism," both leaders in expansion of state-subsidized industry. The U.S. case is well-known. As for Thatcher, her blind pursuit of Friedmanite dogmas that were refuted at every turn succeeded in creating the worst crisis for manufacturing industry since the industrial revolution, destroying almost 1/3 of the manufacturing plant within a few years, a fact extensively detailed (and deplored) by actual conservatives, notably Ian Gilmour. Nevertheless, the disaster was somewhat alleviated by the growth of state-subsidized industry. At least in military industry and sale of torture equipment to countries with awful human rights records, England remains a world leader. London is not far behind Washington in its aggressive pursuit of arms sales including such meritorious customers as Saddam Hussein and Suharto, pursuing the shared doctrine expressed by Thatcher's Defense Procurement Minister Alan Clark: "I don't really fill my mind much with what one set of foreigners is doing to another."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.6" HREF="#FN4.6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Corporate decisions for power rather than simple profit are often reasonable enough as a tactic in relentless class war. Particular choices of technology provide one example. The recent health care debacle is another case in point. Much of U.S. industry would probably gain from a rational public insurance program, which is why it was advocated editorially by <CITE>Business Week.</CITE> But it is unwise to allow the general public to realize that government can carry out useful acts. Despite the heavy shadow cast by business, government remains the one system of power and authority that is to some degree under public influence, unlike private tyrannies, which are almost entirely unaccountable. Enhancing their power is worth some sacrifice in profit.

<P>There are other reasons for sacrificing short-run gain. Executives point out to the business press that it is worthwhile to ship manufacturing jobs even to Germany, with its much higher labor costs, so as to facilitate class warfare. A Gillette Corporation executive explains that the company is "concerned about having only one place where a product is made," primarily because of "labor problems." Thus if Boston workers strike, Gillette could supply both the European and U.S. markets from its Berlin plant, thereby breaking the strike; and vice versa. It is only reasonable, then, that Gillette should employ over three times as many workers abroad as in the U.S., irrespective of costs. Strikes of critical importance are now underway in Illinois, where Caterpillar and other corporations are attempting to destroy the last vestige of unions. "Like many US companies, Caterpillar has pursued a business strategy that has nudged American workers away from defiance toward compliance," business correspondent James Tyson reports. The strategy includes "manufacturing at cheaper facilities abroad" and "relying on imports from factories in Brazil, Japan, and Europe" -- and, of course, hiring scabs and temps and relying on the criminal state to refuse to enforce labor laws, a stand raised to principle by the Reaganites,

<P>Such considerations help explain why U.S. corporations are "creating jobs overseas" despite the fact that "a dollar and falling labor costs have made American products increasingly competitive," as the <CITE>Times</CITE> reports. Overseas investment is rising at twice the rates of exports, and profits corporations earn from production abroad are almost double those from exports. These are natural ways to use the "dazzling profits" they reap from "conservative" social policies, and the further gains anticipated from the Gingrich Contract.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.7" HREF="#FN4.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Courts too have sometimes been frank about their contributions to the rollback campaign. Denying an appeal by workers who had lost jobs when Ohio plants were moved to states with cheaper labor, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stated accurately that "States and counties in the United States compete with each other for companies contemplating relocation," and labor laws neither "discourage such relocations" nor bar closing of unionized plants in favor of "a nonunion plant in another part of the country or in a foreign country," as "contemplated" by NAFTA. The Court then explained the background. Congress and the courts "have made the social judgment, rightly or wrongly, that our capitalistic system, Darwinian though it may be, will not discourage companies from locating on the basis of their own calculations of factors relating to efficiency and competitiveness. The rules of the marketplace govern. By so reflecting commercial interests, the institutions of government serve -- according to current legal and economic theory -- the long-term best interests of society as a whole. That is the basic social policy the country has opted to follow."

<P>The candor is unusual, though the deception is typical. "The country" has "opted" for no such course, and it is radically false that "the rules of the market place govern" or that the system is "Darwinian" (in the intended sense of "social Darwinism," which has little to do with biology) -- except, of course, for the poor and the weak, who are indeeed subjected to these rules by those who cast their usual shadow by means of Congress and the courts.

<P>As for the dedication of "legal and economic theory" to "the long-term best interests of society as a whole," perhaps that was best described by Swiss economist Simonde de Sismondi 175 years ago, commenting on the doctrines of the founder of modern economic theory, David Ricardo, who patiently explained that employment was of no consequence to an economy as long as rent and profits, which funded new investment, were in good shape. "Wealth is everything, men are absolutely nothing?," Sismondi replied: "In truth then, there is nothing more to wish for than that the king, remaining alone in the island, by constantly turning a crank, might produce, through automata, all the output of England." Others have no further right to be in England, and should go elsewhere, the laws of the new science proclaimed.

<P>The founders of the science were surpassed by none in their devotion to the "happiness of the people," and even advocated some extension of the franchise to this end: "not indeed, universally to all people, but to that part of them which cannot be supposed to have any interest in overturning the right of property," David Ricardo explained, adding that still heavier restrictions would be appropriate if it were shown that "limiting the elective franchise to the very narrowest bounds" would guarantee more "security for a good choice of representatives." There's an ample record of similar thoughts, and actions, to the present day.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.8" HREF="#FN4.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The internationalization of production puts quite a different cast on contemporary debate about "American decline." As a geographical entity, the country is declining in many respects. But the principal architects of policy have quite different interests, as the "merchants and manufacturers" did in 18th century England, and make sure that they are "most peculiarly attended to," whatever the effect on others, including their own populations. Nothing fundamental has changed in that regard since Adam Smith's observations, apart from the dedicated zeal of the efforts to suppress the obvious. With these truisms in mind, we should not be surprised to find that while the U.S. role in manufacturing production is declining if we consider the geographical entity, it is holding its own quite nicely if we consider the share in global production of U.S.-based corporations. The same is true of the "trade deficit." If we consider international borders, the U.S. has a huge deficit. But when the Commerce Department recalculated, counting profits of U.S. companies abroad as U.S. exports, the deficit turned into a huge surplus: the recalculation was reasonable, the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> explained, because the profits gained abroad "benefit companies domestically through greater investment and R&D." The recalculation interprets the words "United States" in the terms that matter for the "principal architects of policy: not the geographical area or its people, but the people who count.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.9" HREF="#FN4.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>These remarks barely skim the surface. It's easy to understand the mood of desperation, anxiety, hopelessness and fear that is so prevalent in the world, outside of wealthy and privileged sectors who see the opportunity to achieve at last the kind of power that was out of reach when the democratic distemper infected nation-states and popular forces could mobilize to win human rights and defend them.


<A NAME="SEC4.2"><H3>"Intractable Contradictions"</H3></A>

<P>Recall the concerns of <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reporter David Rosenbaum that "however worthy the goals and however sensible the principles" of the Gingrich reformers, their dedication to the poor faces "seemingly intractable contradictions." The most important one, scrupulously ignored, is the need to protect the wealthy and powerful from market discipline in traditional ways, now being extended. But there are other problems.

<P>Educated and privileged sectors, reasoning along Ricardo's lines, see little problem in the fact that policies are executed in "technocratic insulation," unimpeded by public interests and concerns. But the population has to be controlled somehow. For obvious reasons, one cannot appeal to them on grounds of the intended effects of the policies that are being implemented. So other methods are required. There are standard devices. Many can simply be locked up or confined to urban slums. Others can be entrapped by artificial "creation of wants" or other forms of diversion. They can be left in confusion and despair by corporate and other propaganda, a huge industry in the United States for many years. Or they can be mobilized in fear and hatred -- of foreigners, of one another -- or by religious fundamentalist appeals.

<P>The masters of mankind understand very well that people must not be given opportunities to organize in a functioning civil society, which might enable them to pool limited resources and to take their affairs into their own hands. But when the limited admissible means are used to mobilize people to do such needed work as rolling back the social contract, "intractable contradictions" arise. The problems are classic: they were recognized by German industrialists who had supported Hitler's forces as a way to destroy the labor movement, and found -- not to their pleasure -- that he and his followers had some ideas of their own. The Iranian merchants who relied on fundamentalist religious leaders to mobilize the public against the Shah faced the same dilemma shortly after. Some similar "intractable contradictions" are arising right now as the rollback campaign gains force.

<P>The problems have troubled the business press. A <CITE>Fortune</CITE> cover story is headlined "Today's GOP: The Party's Over for Big Business." To mobilize popular forces, the corporate world has been compelled to resort to what are called "cultural issues." But its troops are now prepared to fight the "culture war," as Pat Buchanan and others refer to the various forms of fanaticism they are seeking to engender. That process has opened a "culture gap," <CITE>Fortune</CITE> observes. The CEOs are generally liberal in cultural attitudes. They don't want their children to be forced to pray in schools or taught "creation science." They want their daughters to have opportunities. They not only tend to be pro-choice, but about 60% of CEOs are "adamantly pro-choice, agreeing with the statement that `a woman should be able to get an abortion if she wants one, no matter what the reason'." They do not want to live in a society and culture dominated by Christian fundamentalists, people who worship the Enola Gay or run around with assault rifles, or who debate subtle points about Beast 666 from the Book of Revelations and listen to Pat Robertson explaining how Presidents from Wilson to Bush may have been pawns of "a tightly knit cabal" run by Freemasons and "European bankers," who seek "a new order for the human race under the domination of Lucifer." But these are the sectors they are forced to turn to as a popular base for their assault on democracy and human rights.

<P>Among CEOs, the overwhelming favorite for President is Dick Cheney; Bob Dole and Phil Gramm were backed by a mere 17%, and "right down at the bottom of the pack with a 3% show of support...was Newt Gingrich." Unfortunately for them, however, "The religious right now controls the GOP," <CITE>Fortune</CITE> comments in bold face: "Religious conservatives are the single most powerful force within the GOP," no small group in one of the world's most extreme religious fundamentalist cultures. They "hold veto power over the Republican presidential nomination." "There's a real cultural disconnect between the <CITE>FORTUNE</CITE> 500 and social conservatives," a lobbyist "with strong ties to Christian fundamentalist groups and the new Republicans" observes.

<P>The <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> talks uneasily about "class warfare" -- a term usually avoided like the plague in respectable circles -- referring to a war over "values" that pits the "upper-middle class elites of professionals and managers," their constituency, against the guy in the street who supports the Republican Party that is supposed to do the bidding of these upper-middle class elites. The religious conservatives who hold "veto power" have no great interest in big business, which they rightly see as hostile to the values that they uphold. They gain support from "a few large companies on the fringe of corporate America -- the tobacco industry, Amway." But within the functioning economy, they are viewed with no little dismay, apart from their role in implementing the rollback campaign. They oppose government support for big corporations, threatening a disaster for "free enterprise" if they cannot be kept down in the trenches. They agree that "It's rollback time," as one of their activists says, but they have in mind something quite different from the CEOs. They don't like it when a corporation that has its home in Gingrich's Cobb County denounces an official resolution condemning "the gay life style." The CEOs rightly fear that their troops may move beyond the "culture war," proceeding to undermine the basic framework of state-subsidized private power.

<P>Funding for the Gingrich army reveals the contradictions clearly. Major funders are from marketing schemes like Amway, smaller insurance companies, hedge-funds, and the like. These sectors control plenty of money but are at the fringes of the economy. They are "very much in sync with the `Contract With America'," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reports, which is true only under a special but perhaps accurate interpretion of the support for the Pentagon on the part of their forces, who, unlike the CEOs, are not much interested in the government's role as the "savior" of advanced industry. Furthermore, they come from sectors of the population that really are cringing in fear and terror, seeing enemies coming to get them on all sides, a fact about the extraordinary cultural scene that one cannot simply ignore.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.10" HREF="#FN4.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The contradictions are showing up in Washington. The Commerce Department under Clinton has become "a pro-business dynamo," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> observes, serving private power to an unprecedented degree. But the Gingrich army doesn't understand, which leads to an "uncanny circumstance: Big business allied with a Democratic administration against Republic proposals to trim Commerce's sails." The same is true of the Export-Import Bank, the National Institutes of Health (which have "given birth to the biotechnology industry," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> observes), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Technology Reinvestment Project, Clinton-inspired adjuncts to the Pentagon subsidy to advanced industry. These are wasteful because they are not devoted solely to "military uses," GOP critics charge, failing to comprehend the way the real economy works and perhaps believing the lurid tales about Beast 666, Arab terrorists, and who knows what other agent of Lucifer or the United Nations. Even the hated regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have support from major corporations, which can see ahead far enough to judge the effects of another thalidomide scandal.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4.11" HREF="#FN4.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the early part of this century, there was much fascination with "corporate entities," social "organisms" that have unique rights beyond those of mere individuals. These ideas, growing from more or less the same Hegelian intellectual soil, took several forms, notably Bolshevism, fascism, and the modern corporation. Corporations were granted extraordinary rights by Courts and lawyers, often with the support of "progressives." They are, furthermore, as totalitarian an institution as humans have managed so far to contrive. Terminology is crafted to avoid the substance behind the shadow, so such terms as "fascist" and "totalitarian" are restricted to political entities. But the similarity in character is unmistakeable. Two of these systems of centralized, autocratic, and unaccountable power have succumbed. The third not only remains but is increasing its sway and dominance. There are divisions and conflicts of course, but also much similarity of general conception worldwide, and overarching institutions are also taking shape. The internal contradictions may or may not prove "intractable," but they have ominous import however they are resolved.

<P>The transition from containment of democracy and human rights to actual rollback should be seen against this background. We should also recognize that the new phase of the struggle against the "great beast" is based upon social policies with particular goals that are not graven in stone or founded in laws of nature or society, any more than the human institutions from which they arise.

<P><H3>1. The Anniversary Celebration</H3>

<P>On September 30, the third anniversary of the military coup that overthrew the elected government of Haiti in 1991, jubilant crowds marched peacefully to celebrate the restoration of democracy, encouraged by the official U.S. declaration that the right of peaceful demonstration would be protected by the 20,000 troops who had entered Haiti on September 19 under an agreement between former President Jimmy Carter and General Raoul Cedras. That was, in fact, one of the major goals of the U.S. intervention to restore democracy, the press reported. The demonstrators were attacked, beaten bloody, and scattered by armed gunmen. "The bodies of dead Haitians keep piling up," one Western diplomat said, just as they had the day before when a grenade exploded at a celebration of the return of the elected mayor of Port-au-Prince. U.S. officials complained "that Haitian police could no longer be trusted to enforce law and order," the press reported, "but would not say if US forces would assume responsibility." "It would be very difficult to rely on the police to provide security given the fact they haven't provided any security so far," U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said, apparently surprised that the U.S.-trained police are acting as they have always done in the past.

<P>U.S. combat troops were in the streets in force, but not to protect the demonstrators. "Instead," John Kifner reported in the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> "the tanks, armored vehicles and even two firetrucks were deployed along Avenue John Brown leading to the wealthy suburb of Petionville, as if they were trying to protect the homes of Haiti's affluent, light-skinned elite should the poor of the slums and shantytowns try to charge uphill." "The only conceivable reason for this deployment appeared to be to protect commercial establishments and prevent any crowds from going up the hill toward the homes of the elite."

<P>U.S. military spokesman Colonel Willey "said the troops were positioned to form `a cordon so Haitian police could work on the inner perimeter'." And work they did. Haitian police joined with the paramilitary (FRAPH) gangs attacking the demonstrators, using their trucks for "loading up the armed men in civilian clothes by the Fraph headquarters" and then helping to scatter the demonstrators, "exchanging high-fives with the gunmen or giving them rides in their pickup trucks."

<P>A U.S. military convoy did approach the site of the first attack on the demonstrators, where "at least eight bodies" were counted by journalists. But, Kifner continued, they "quickly drove off, as did others that followed," making it clear that U.S. forces "would not provide protection to the marchers" so that terror could proceed unhampered. U.S. forces "were nowhere near the announced route of the march, from the Basilica of Notre Dame where a requiem mass was celebrated for the more than 3000 people whom human rights groups say were killed during military rule, to the city cemetery." The troops are following White House orders. Explaining the continuing atrocities under U.S. military occupation, commanding General Henry Shelton informed the press that he had been instructed by his superiors in Washington that "it is not our policy to intervene in law-and-order matters per se; that is a Haitian matter." The problem, he said, is that Haitian police are "not trained in riot control." The "level of civility that is here," he explained, "is provided by the police and the military, which is under the control of General Cedras." And by the inheritors of the Tontons Macoutes, who are to be controlled by the Haitian police with whom they exchange high-fives as they perform their common tasks.

<P>FRAPH members interviewed by <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> correspondents Helene Cooper and Jose de Cordoba said they had no problems with the Americans troops. While the attacks on the demonstrators are underway, one said, "U.S. soldiers riding by on their `Humvee' armored vehicles wave cheerfully to FRAPH members, who wave back." At the September 30 anniversary march, the <CITE>WSJ</CITE> report continues, "those Humvees, along with tanks and other armored vehicles, staged a massive show of `presence' with the intention of containing the pro-Aristide demonstration to downtown, and addressing what appears to be the U.S.'s principal fear: that mobs of President Aristide's supporters will go on a rampage against wealthy Haitians and supporters of the military regime." Back in Washington, Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch "said US troops would use force to stop violence only when their own safety was assured," though it seems that exceptions will be allowed if "wealthy Haitians and supporters of the military regime" might be endangered by "pro-Aristide mobs."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The <CITE>Times</CITE> reacted in its lead editorial on the day of Kifner's front-page story about the deployment of troops and its motives. It addressed one problem only: the danger that Clinton might "meddle in the nation's political affairs" by using the CIA to promote Aristide. "If President Aristide is as popular as the Administration believes, he does not need the C.I.A.'s propaganda help," the editors observe. Perhaps they are thinking of the barrage of propaganda let loose via the leading CIA specialist on Latin America, Brian Latell, who contrasted the "murderer and psychopath" Aristide with the model gentleman General Cedras, one of "the most promising group of Haitian leaders to emerge since the Duvalier family," which is why Latell "saw no evidence of oppressive rule" while Cedras's forces and their allies were slaughtering, torturing, raping and rampaging. "The U.S. should be wary about tying "its own interests, and the safety of its troops, so closely to [Aristide's] cause," the editors added soberly.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The <CITE>Times</CITE> editorial staff reflexively assumes that the facts are what Washington declares them to be; the CIA is being used to promote Aristide, a dubious form of interference in another country's affairs, they warn. Others, less trusting, actually inquire. Once again showing what a serious journalist can do, Alan Nairn took the trouble to find out what Clinton's intelligence apparatus is really up to. One of the more benign figures he unearthed is Haitian-born Major Louis Kernisan, who served with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in Haiti from 1989 through 1991 and is now devising the plan to "professionalize" Haiti's police -- already professionalized by the same professionals, in the very recent past. Kernisan is much impressed by the impartial role of the army that has terrorized Haiti since it was established under the 1915-34 U.S. military occupation, and by the murderous section chiefs, disbanded by Aristide in one of the moves that raised doubts about his democratic credentials. Kernisan is part of an FBI unit set up to train the security forces of Guatemala and El Salvador in 1986, with notable success. He anticipates mass detentions and other techniques of population control as the popular movements are reined in and the U.S. restores to power "the same folks as before, the five families that run the country, the military and the bourgeoisie." Construction of yet another "showcase of democracy" seems well underway. But that is the real world.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The real world is described succinctly by "a US official with extensive experience of Haiti," quoted in the <CITE>Boston Globe.</CITE> "Aristide -- slum priest, grass-roots activist, exponent of Liberation Theology -- `represents everything that CIA, DOD and FBI think they have been trying to protect this country against for the past 50 years'," he said. They have not misunderstand their instructions from the executive branch, and the interests it represents.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It is hard to imagine that Washington will permit such crass display of the class and power interests of the intervention, and its intent to subvert and eliminate any thought of democracy. Cosmetic changes will surely be needed, if only for the benefit of the doctrinal institutions, which have to have some peg, however fragile, on which to hang the official tales about "idealism," "good works," "benevolent intentions," and the rest of the familiar ritual. Allowing FRAPH and the rest of the attache-Macoute system to function freely will pose an eventual threat to the occupying forces themselves, though they have been given ample time to go underground with their weapons and organizational structure intact.

<H3>2. Dilemmas of Power</H3>

<P>The continuing state terror under the eyes of the U.S. military forces reveals the "riskiness of having the Pentagon rely on Haiti's police," <CITE>Times</CITE> correspondent Steven Greenhouse reported. The solution, the Administration believes, "is pressing prominent Aristide allies to warn people against provoking street violence" and urging that Parliament get down to serious business, beginning with the primary task: "to pass an amnesty for the military -- as promised in the Carter agreement." That seems the most direct and reasonable way to deal with the difficulties caused by those who are provoking FRAPH and its police allies.

<P>But there is a problem. Aristide continues to be slippery and evasive, despite the tutelage he has received in Washington. While some officials challenge "the conventional wisdom of Aristide as a doctrinaire monomaniac," the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> reports, he "is nonetheless showing some of his old ambiguity now": while calling for "nonviolence and reconciliation,...he has also been lukewarm to the idea of a blanket amnesty," still not unambiguously joining Washington, the media, and political commentators generally in accepting the principle of complete impunity for murder, torture, rape, and other atrocities. 
Untrustworthy as always, Aristide seems to be hesitant about defying the plea of the major human rights organizations, the United Nations, the South African Judge who is chief prosecutor for the UN war-crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and his Australian deputy, and others who do not rise to such heights of Christian mercy as U.S. elites, and who warn of the consequences for international human rights law if the criminals are informed that they can do their work with impunity.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Recall that they were so informed in Haiti, from the start. Cedras, police chief Francois, and the rest were informed with great clarity that they could continue their work of decimating the popular organizations, secure in the knowledge that when the time came for them to hand the work over to others, they would either be flown out on an American jet with what remained of the country's wealth in their pockets, like Somoza and Duvalier, or allowed to stay on in the rich suburbs enjoying the fruits of their labors and awaiting the next opportunity, which may not be too long delayed. Given such unambiguous assurances from on high, there never was the slightest reason for them to call a halt to the terrorist onslaught against the disobedient population -- one of the many truisms that would be featured in a free and independent press.

<P>The gangsters in charge know the routine as well as their Washington helpers. Guatemala, in many ways the model of successful counterinsurgency, is a case in point. Here, "democracy" was officially restored by a combination of Nazi-style violence with U.S. support, combined with softer measures, minimal services organized by the conquerors: if you want your sick child to live, come to us, and maybe we'll help; work for us, and you have even better prospects. As the U.S. arranged to displace the generals in Haiti, "free elections" were held once again in Guatemala, which Washington has been nurturing as a "showcase" for free market democracy for 40 years. The winner was Rios Montt, a gentleman who would receive a welcome reception from Himmler and Beria, as he did from Ronald Reagan and the State Department, who hailed him as a man "totally committed to democracy" while he was presiding over the slaughter of tens of thousands of people in the highlands, levelling some 400 villages. In the recent elections, Rios Montt's party received about 1/3 of the vote, enabling it to control the legislature along with the other right-wing pro-business party. About 80% of the population stayed away, including the indigenous people he targeted for destruction and the poor generally, who seem not to appreciate the freedoms we have won for them. Cedras and Francois may well have drawn the obvious conclusions, even if commentators here did not.

<P>It's easy to appreciate the dilemmas faced by policy-makers and respectable intellectuals. It is, indeed, "risky" to rely on the chief instruments of terror to stop terror, but hard to see what the alternative is when faced with irrational and criminal adversaries: those who provoke violence by peacefully calling for democracy and freedom, and those who respond to the provocation. It is also a challenging task to reconcile truths of logic with what is taking place before our eyes. Thus "the objective of the Haiti mission...is certainly an honorable one," Anthony Lewis declares, from the outer limits of tolerable dissent. And this Certain Truth must somehow be reconciled with the sight of U.S. forces deployed to protect the wealthy and privileged while the usual victims bleed in the streets and the usual torturers maintain "the level of civility." Furthermore, how are we to comprehend the remarkable fact that the U.S. is carrying out the same policies it has pursued without change for 200 years in Haiti, as it has elsewhere within the reach of its power? It's all very mysterious. One can see why the situation is regularly described as "confusing," posing extraordinary dilemmas.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>There were other difficult tasks as the troops landed, and at the time of writing (early October), they have been handled with no little success. Three central doctrines have to be defended: First, the Clinton Administration was appalled by the terror in Haiti. Second, it had become clear by "last spring" that "draconian economic sanctions would fail" so that stronger steps were needed to achieve the goal (Taylor Branch). And third, that goal is "to create conditions favorable to constitutional democracy" (Branch). The third doctrine is too deeply entrenched to be open to discussion, so let us keep to the first two, which at least seem to have a factual flavor.

<P>The first doctrine was elaborated by senior White House officials, who informed the press that there is "nothing more moving" than "watching people being beaten," so that "Mr. Clinton and his aides had come to view such violence as both morally repugnant and politically unsustainable." "Four or five nights of it on television would have undone us politically," a senior Administration official informed the press. These problems led to a "level of concern within the Administration...so great that senior officials from several agencies meet twice a day to plot their public-relations strategy, White House officials said."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The dilemmas faced by the Administration are clarifed by comparison with other current examples, say Colombia, where vast atrocities render ridiculous any thought of democracy; mere survival is enough of a problem for those who dare to raise their heads. But these atrocities are "politically sustainable." The press does not report the facts made public by the leading human rights organizations, Church groups, and others. The atrocities are not even "morally repugnant," or so a rational observer would conclude. About half of U.S. military aid for the hemisphere now goes to the state terrorists in Colombia, increasing under Clinton; and the man who presided over the worst terror in recent years took office as Secretary-General of the OAS just before U.S. troops landed in Haiti, having achieved this post thanks to a White House power play that was accompanied by much public praise for his achievements.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Let us turn to the second Truth, the failure of the draconian economic sanctions that was evident by last spring. As known to readers of this journal at least, the facts are radically different. As of last spring, there had been no draconian economic sanctions. The Bush administration let it be known at once that the OAS sanctions announced in October 1991, shortly after the coup, were to be toothless. A few weeks later (Feb. 4), Bush undermined the sanctions more explicitly, granting an "exemption" to U.S. enterprises. Trade continued at a substantial level through 1992, then increasing by 50% under Clinton, including purchases by the Federal government and a sharp increase in imports of food exports from Haiti. The facts were not totally supressed in the mainstream. The Bush exemption of February 1992 was reported. In the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> under the headline "U.S. Plans to Sharpen Focus of Its Sanctions Against Haiti," correspondent Barbara Crossette explained that the Administration would permit these violations of the embargo so as "to punish anti-democratic forces and ease the plight of workers who lost jobs because of the ban on trade." This "fine tuning" is Washington's "latest move" in its efforts to find "more effective ways to hasten the collapse of what the Administration calls an illegal Government in Haiti." Oddly, the "fine tuning" was welcomed by the "anti-democratic forces" who were punished by it, and bitterly denounced by the beneficiaries of our charitable impulses. Again, a bit "confusing."

<P>Occasional later references did not entirely relieve the confusion. Thus the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE> explained that "the Bush and Clinton administrations believed these [U.S.-owned] companies were so vital to Haiti that they allowed them to continue operating during the embargo." While the vision of our benevolence brings tears to the eyes, nevertheless duller minds might wonder why only U.S.-owned enterprises have the curious property of being so beneficial to the suffering people of Haiti, and why the reactions are so inconsistent with Administration intent.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Elsewhere too, one could find some hints that the embargo was less than "draconian." In fact, as of last spring, it was "fine tuned" so as to leave the rich and their military associates pretty much untouched, though the undesirables suffered. It was only in late May 1994 that the Clinton Administration even took formal steps to implement sanctions, always excluding the most privileged.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As the troops landed on Monday September 19, the task of maintaining the crucial doctrine became still more challenging. On Sunday, the AP wires began running reports about the military intervention that every news desk in the country could see were of major significance, perhaps the most important of the week. Beginning Sunday, John Solomon reported leaks from an inquiry initiated by the U.S. attorney's office a few days before the invasion. The documents released to AP revealed that sanctions had never been seriously applied at all. It is possible that the inquiry was launched in preparation for the intervention, under the same general rubric that led the press to highlight the murder of orphans, narcotrafficking, and other atrocities that had previously remained at the margins or unreported.

<P>According to documents provided to AP, the judicial inquiry focused on the most important evasion of the embargo, known to everyone watching Haiti: the import of oil. The three companies involved are Shell, Exxon, and Texaco. The first two were able to pretend that subsidiaries elsewhere were violating the embargo, leaving poor Washington helpless. But Texaco lacked that pretext, and was therefore bound by the Bush administration executive order of October 1991 banning its Haitian activities. The Office of Foreign Assets Control began monitoring Texaco's violation of the order immediately, noting that Texaco was providing both fuel and hard currency to the military junta. On May 18, 1992, OFAC issued an order for Texaco to "cease and desist." On the same day, Texaco executives spoke to Secretary of Treasury Nicholas Brady and OFAC Director Richard Newcomb, who met with them the following day. Both Brady and Newcomb were informed that Texaco planned to evade the executive order by creating a "blind trust" that would technically be responsible for the shipments; Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger received the same information. Texaco asked OFAC for a ruling on this evasion. No response was received for 11 months, when OFAC advised the company that the device was illegal. By then, the operation was proceeding. Until at least mid-1993, OFAC alleges, Texaco stations "illegally bought and distributed numerous tanker shipments of fuel from the junta either directly or through the blind trust." A 1993 OFAC document reports at least 26 tanker shipments, 160 violations, and millions of dollars paid to the junta by Texaco.

<P>Newcomb informed his senior staff that he had been directed to drag his feet by Secretary of Treasury Brady. "Brady told me to go slow on Texaco," Newcomb is quoted as saying in notes of a mid-1992 meeting. Surely Texaco executives were apprised. "After three years and two administrations," AP continues, "Newcomb has yet to impose a fine or refer the matter to the U.S. attorney's office for possible prosecution," though in September 1993 he "put Texaco on notice that the government intends to fine the company." "Little has happened in the year since," the report continues.

<P>In a July 1993 memo, after Aristide had been pressured to accept the Governor's Island compromise that Cedras violated, OFAC policy chief John Roth wrote: "Perhaps the selective and political side to FAC's `strong enforcement' of the sanctions...can be squared with some cosmic (but not widely known) foreign or domestic policy objectives vis-a-vis Haiti or Texaco." Perhaps.

<P>The illegal operations continued at least until the May 1994 Clinton administration decision to join in sanctions -- making sure that plenty of loopholes remained, including the oddly porous Dominican border. Nothing was done. The Clinton administration certainly knew about the matter a year ago. "We expect a vigorous lobbying effort by Texaco to quash FAC's penalty action," Treasury Secreatary Lloyd Bentsen was advised in an October 1, 1993 memo, which added that "Texaco has already contacted the State Department in an effort to have State persuade FAC to drop the matter," as it evidently did. "There has been no activity in the case for nearly a year" after this notification, Solomon reported.

<P>In response to the AP story on Sunday September 18, Treasury Secretary Bentsen ordered an investigation, which, if it takes place, is likely to focus on the Bush years. Senator Donald Riegle and Representative Henry Gonzalez, who chair the banking committees, "expressed outrage at OFAC's conduct described in the documents and indicated their panels will review the case" as well, also looking into the role of banks in helping Texaco fund the junta. "I think it's outrageous," Rep. Gonzales stated: "It's a joke if it is decided to announce a policy and then it isn't enforced."

<P>In brief, as the U.S. troops landed, if not before, no news desk or editorial office could have failed to be aware of what had been concealed for the three years of slaughter and terror: the sanctions were "a joke." How much of a joke, they perhaps had not known until September 18. In a free press, all of this would have been featured, along with the obvious conclusions: neither the Bush nor Clinton administration had any serious intent of terminating the terror and restoring democracy. Investigative reporters would have gotten to work to smoke out the rest of the story (for example, the still-unreported trade). And columnists would have explained what it all means.

<P>What in fact happened was rather different: solemn reiteration of the established truths about our noble goals and the failure of the draconian sanctions, coupled with warnings about intervening in conflicts that are none of our business. According to a data-base search, the AP story was reported on Tuesday, Sept. 20, by one journal in the country: <CITE>Platt's Oilgram News,</CITE> which reported Texaco's denials. The next day, the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> ran a brief item by an unidentified staff reporter at the bottom of an inside page, reporting Bentsen's order for an investigation and a few of the facts. Similar reports, mostly short and on inside pages, appeared in local papers, but not the national press. All of this will have to come out sooner or later -- perhaps, after the Haiti operation goes irremediably sour and the time comes for the excuses and evasions to be trotted out, Somalia-style. But when it mattered, the Free Press did its job in admirable fashion, once again.

<P>As any serious commentator would also have observed, there is nothing new about the special treatment granted Texaco (we put aside the evasions about its competitors). One similar occasion took place just 50 years ago, when the Western democracies were seeking to undermine the Spanish Republic, which was then under attack by Franco's fascist forces. The reason was their concern that the popular revolution that was one component of this three-sided struggle might spread; such concerns were put to rest shortly after by their associate in Moscow, who crushed the revolution by violence, fearing any manifestation of socialism and freedom even more than his Western colleagues. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's "neutrality" stand was carefully crafted to deprive the Republic of arms and oil. His administration pressured suppliers (including foreign ones) to refrain from shipping materials, including shipments contracted earlier. FDR himself bitterly denounced one businessman who insisted on his legal right to continue shipments of airplanes and parts to the Republic. Though "perfectly legal," his act was "thoroughly unpatriotic," FDR declared, apologizing for his emotional outburst but adding that "I feel quite deeply about it." Meanwhile, his government was never able to discover that Texaco, then headed by a fascist sympathizer, was violating its contracts with the Republic, diverting tankers already at sea to Franco, whom it continued to supply -- in "secret," except to small left journals which, somehow, were able to discover the facts about the illegal shipments hidden from the Roosevelt Administration and the press.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In January 1994 testimony to Congress, reported here in July, the Director of the CIA had predicted that Haiti "probably will be out of fuel and power very shortly." "Our intelligence efforts are focused on detecting attempts to circumvent the embargo and monitoring its impact." Not only was the CIA "unable" to discover the "oil boom" that was occasionally reported by the press, but it was also unable to discover that the U.S. government, at the highest level, was fully aware that the CIA testimony to Congress was a complete falsehood, and had indeed tacitly authorized the violations of the embargo that the CIA couldn't discover. Or, so we are supposed to believe, as we are now supposed to believe that the CIA is busily at work organizing support for Aristide. 

<H3>3. Democracy and Capitalism</H3>

<P>Whether Aristide is allowed to return in some fashion is anyone's guess at the time of writing. If he is, it will be under conditions designed to discredit him and further demoralize those who hoped that democracy might be tolerated in Haiti. To evaluate what lies ahead, we should look carefully at the plans for the security forces and the economy.

<P>The military and police forces were established during Woodrow Wilson's invasion as an instrument to control the population, and have been kept in power by U.S. aid and training for that purpose since. That is to continue. As discussed here in July, the head of the OAS/UN mission through December 1993, Ian Martin, reported in <CITE>Foreign Policy</CITE> that negotiations had stalled because of Washington's insistence on maintaining the power of the security forces, rejecting Aristide's plea to reduce them along lines that had proven successful in Costa Rica, the one partial exception to the array of horror chambers that Washington has maintained in the region. The Haitian military, Martin observed, recognized that the U.S. was its friend and protector, unlike the U.N., France, and Canada. The generals continued their resistance to a diplomatic settlement, trusting that "the United States, despite its rhetoric of democracy, was ambivalent about that power shift" to popular elements represented by Aristide. They were proven right. As the matter is now rephrased, "At first, Father Aristide resisted having so many former soldiers in the police force, but Administration officials said they persuaded him to accept them," so the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reported on the eve of the invasion. This was one of the successes of the educational program designed for the "doctrinaire monomaniac."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The plans for the economy are detailed in a plan submitted to the Paris Club of international donors at the World Bank in August, published by Alan Nairn in <CITE>Multinational Monitor</CITE> (July-August), with accompanying interviews. The Aristide government is to keep to a standard "structural adjustment" package, with foreign funds devoted primarily to debt repayment and the needs of the business sectors, and with an "open foreign investment policy." The judicial system and other aspects of government are to be geared to "economic efficiency." The plan states that "The renovated state must focus on an economic strategy centered on the energy and initiative of Civil Society, especially the private sector, both national and foreign."

<P>The Haiti desk officer of the World Bank, Axel Peuker, describes the plan as beneficial to the "more open, enlightened, business class" and foreign investors. The structural adjustment plan "is not going to hurt the poor to the extent it has in other countries," he said, because subsidies for basic goods and other such interferences with capitalist democracy scarcely exist there anyway, so not too much will be cut. The Minister in charge of rural development and agrarian reform in the Aristide government was not even notified about the plan designed for this largely peasant society, destined to be returned to the track from which it veered after the unfortunate December 1990 election, a tragedy that will not happen again, if Washington is vigilant.

<P>We may note, in passing, some of the features of contemporary Newspeak. "Economic efficiency" means profits for the few, crucially the foreign few, whatever the effect on the many. The concept "economic health" is a technical notion designed to measure profitability for investors, while excluding the health of the economy as far as the population is concerned. Thus the economy can be wonderfully healthy while the people are starving. "Civil Society" of course includes all sorts of nice things, but "especially" the private business sector, including foreign investors, who belong to the part of Haitian Civil Society on which the "renovated state" must focus. Democracy means that outsiders design plans without even troubling to inform the government that is to execute them.

<P>The concept of "democracy" is also illustrated by the standard interpretation of the provision of the Haitian Constitution that provides for the elected President to serve a single five-year term. In his address to the nation to rally support for the intervention, President Clinton assured his audience that Aristide had proven himself to be a true democrat. "Tonight," Clinton said, "I can announce that President Aristide has pledged to step down when his term ends in accordance with the Constitution" and to transfer power to a successor. That conclusion, however, goes well beyond the Constitution, which says nothing about how to calculate the President's term when he has spent three years in exile while civil society is being decimated. One interpretation is that if reinstated, he should pick up where he left off, so that Aristide's term has almost 4 and a half years to run. Another interpretation is that his period in exile is part of his term as elected President. People with some lingering taste for democracy will presumably tend towards the first interpretation. Without any exception that I can discover, U.S. commentators adopted Clinton's anti-democratic interpretation. We have to go north of the border to read the obvious comment about "the three years of stolen democracy": "By deducting them from, rather than adding them to, Aristide's suspended presidency, a key political objective will be achieved," namely, "a partial legitimization of the 1991 coup d'etat against Aristide" (Dave Todd, Southam News).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></FONT></SUP> The task of civilizing the troublesome priest has not been easy, and there is disagreement as to whether it has been accomplished, or whether he might still revert to his old ways, speaking up for the rights of poor and suffering people, even expressing elementary truths about the oppression of the poor by the rich (inciting "class warfare") and the role of the U.S. in his country's history ("anti-Americanism"). Close U.S. advisors claim to see much progress. Former Ambassador Robert White, who has consistently supported the elected government in Haiti, said: "I think the best thing that has happened to Aristide and his administration-in-exile is that they have had a crash course in democracy and capitalism, and come to understand that too much revolution scares away investors. Small countries can't afford too much social experimentation."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It's not clear whether these remarks are tongue-in-cheek, but taking them literally, they are on target. Aristide has been given a crash course in "democracy and capitalism," as the terms are understood under prevailing doctrine. "Democracy" means that you do what you're told and serve the powerful and rich, in silence -- or better, politely expressing your gratitude for the opportunity. "Capitalism" means the same. The "social experimentation" that went too far is the programs that were highly praised by the Inter-American Development Bank and other international funding agencies, and that Axel Peuker of the World Bank describes today as a "rather conservative approach, financial and otherwise" -- but too much for the Haitian rich, U.S. investors, Washington, and respectable opinion in the United States.

<P>The reasons why this conservative approach went too far are expressed with clarity in a July 1994 position paper of 1400 priests and nuns in Haiti and the surviving Haitian human rights groups. "The constant factor in that brief period" of democracy "cannot be doubted," they write: "it is, unquestionably, the emergence of the people of Haiti on the political scene of its country." The technical term for this atrocity among Western liberal elites is "Crisis of Democracy," a threat that must be confronted forthrightly if "democracy" is to be saved. The terror in Haiti, and the crash course in democracy and capitalism organized for Aristide in Washington, have been designed to drive such subversive thoughts out of people's heads, for good.

<P>Not everyone agrees that Aristide has learned his lessons. "He is a radical Roman Catholic priest who has fought with his church" -- much as anti-fascist priests opposed their church under Mussolini and Hitler -- "and often spewed anti-American statements," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reports. "His stubbornness and independence continue to drive U.S. officials to distraction." They expect better behavior from the lower orders. Senator Phil Gramm condemns Aristide as an "anti-American Marxist demagogue." Particularly outrageous was his reticence about thanking his rescuers as they proceeded to restore the power of the army and the wealthy, perhaps allowing him to sit in a box for a few months to observe the process. New records may have been broken for supercilious arrogance and racism as the press reported the suffering that Washington had endured at his hands. In the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> Maureen Dowd described "the strain of trying for three years to restore Father Aristide to power even as he often openly griped about American policy" and failed to say "Thank you" with proper humility to "his benefactors" ("The Mouse That Roared Squeaks Back"). Congress mocked "the priest's desire to return on his own terms rather than those dictated by Washington," she reported. "He wants to stay up here" and enjoy "the good life," Senator Larry Pressler said, echoing the concerns of President Clinton, reported by "those close to him," about "whether Father Aristide had begun to enjoy his life as a celebrity exile." Meanwhile liberal Representatives were "furiously demanding he show more gratitude," that he "get real" (James Traficant). He should learn some manners, David Obey added: "The proper response from Aristide is not to second guess and nitpick. The proper response is two words, `Thank you'." Aristide has still not learned his place. He has not learned that his job is to shuffle quietly with a friendly smile while thanking Massa for his kindness.

<P>Aristide's disgraceful behavior reinforced the fears expressed a few days earlier by political correspondent Elaine Sciolino, who worried that he might not "be the kind of leader who will make the Administration proud when he rides in on the backs of American soldiers" and who might even "turn on his liberators." In its efforts to change the radical priest "From Robespierre to Gandhi," the Clinton Administration -- all dedicated Gandhians, like the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> -- is "heartened...by his public statements that stress love rather than vengeance," and his call to "let free enterprise and privatization reign." "To help prepare Father Aristide for his return, Administration officials have tried to force feed him large doses of economics and theories of public administration." While some feel that "he has really grown," others are concerned that he might regress to what he was -- when he was praised for the remarkable successes of his brief administration in cutting back corruption and state terror, reducing the bloated bureaucracy, organizing a reasonable tax system and setting the country's financial affairs in order, while still trying to respond to the initiatives of the "remarkably advanced" array of grass-roots organizations (Lavalas) that gave the large majority of the population a "considerable voice in local affairs" and even in national politics (IADB, Americas Watch).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It is in this precise sense that Aristide "failed politically when he was in there," as explained by the Clinton's special envoy Lawrence Pezzullo, replaced after his lying to Congress became too embarrassing; the outspoken advocacy of mass slaughter by Carter's envoy to Nicaragua was never an embarrassment, nor was his record of trying to ensure that Nicaragua's murderous National Guard would stay in power (that, after all, was a crucial part of the task of "restoring democracy" in Haiti too). Pezzullo made these remarks while reporting his "growing frustration" with the stubborn Aristide, who "was unwilling to make political compromises to broaden his political base" beyond the huge majority of the population. He even refused "to work with Parliament," Pezzullo observed with horror -- that is, with the Parliament that was able to stay almost entirely in the hands of the "enlightened" sectors of Civil Society, since the authentic civil society still lacked the resources to challenge the traditional system of oppression and violence (always cheerfully backed by Washington). "It was precisely Father Aristide's estrangement from the elected Parliament, coupled with his chilly relationship with business leaders and the military, that led to his overthrow," Pezzullo explained. Obviously, a bad character, though one could hardly expect more in a country "with no democratic traditions" -- only with a vibrant and lively civil society that had, unexpectedly, constructed the foundations of a functioning democracy in which the rabble could actually take part in managing their own affairs.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Aristide's unwillingness to "broaden the political base" has become a kind of mantra, on a par with "Wilsonian idealism." Like many other mindless propaganda slogans, the phrase conceals a grain of truth. Aristide has been unwilling to shift power to the "enlightened" sectors of foreign and domestic Civil Society and their security forces. He still keeps his allegiance to the general population and their organizations -- who could teach some lessons to their kindly tutors about what was meant by "democracy" in days when the term was still taken seriously. It is intriguing to watch the process at work. Consider Peter Hakim, Washington director of the Inter-American dialogue, well-informed about the hemisphere and far from a ranting ideologue. While Aristide was elected by a two-thirds majority, Hakim observes, "in most Latin American countries, movement from authoritarianism to democracy tends to reflect a more broadly based consensus than is currently the case in Haiti." It is true enough that from the southern cone to Central America and the Caribbean, the consensus is "broadly based" in the sense that sustained terror and degradation, much of it organized right where Hakim speaks, has taught people to abandon hope for freedom and democracy, and to accept the rule of private power, domestic and foreign. It hasn't been easy; witness the case of Guatemala, just now attaining the proper broad consensus after many years of education. Hakim also surely knows the nature of the "consensus" at home, revealed by the belief of half the population that the political system is so rotten that both parties should be disbanded. And he knows full well what efforts are made to broaden government to include authentic representatives of the overwhelming majority of the population in Latin America, or by its traditional master.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Aristide is not alone in being a slow student. U.N. envoy Dante Caputo resigned when the invasion was imminent, deploring the unilateral U.S. initiatives that displaced the United Nations entirely. "In effect," he said, "the total absence of consultation and information from the United States Government makes me believe that this country has in fact taken the unilateral decision of acting on its own in the Haitian process," so that the U.N. no longer has any role to play. Referring to Carter's grand achievement, Caputo said: "they got a much weaker agreement with 60 military planes in the air than we got at the negotiating table" in July 1993. Cedras scoffed at that one, Caputo notes, and may well do the same this time, proceeding to "build a political force with Haiti's ruling class, leaving most of the country's current military and economic power base intact." Caputo was too diplomatic to add that this contemptuous disregard for the United Nations is standard operating procedure, and is only to be expected of the world's most powerful state, which has no reason to pay any attention to world opinion or international law, secure in the knowledge that whatever happens, its intentions will be deemed "certainly honorable" by its harshest critics among the respectable intelligentsia.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<H3>4. Perspective</H3>

<P>"Perspective" on what is taking place was provided in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> by R. W. Apple, who reviewed the lessons of history. "For two centuries," he wrote, "political opponents in Haiti have routinely slaughtered each other. Backers of President Aristide, followers of General Cedras and the former Tontons Macoute retain their homicidal tendencies, to say nothing about their weapons" -- which the homicidal maniacs in the slums have cleverly concealed. "Like the French in the 19th century, like the Marines who occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934, the American forces who are trying to impose a new order will confront a complex and violent society with no history of democracy."

<P>One takes for granted that the vicious terror and racism of the Wilson administration and its successors will be transmuted to sweet charity as it reaches the educated classes, but it is a novelty to see Napoleon's invasion, one of the most hideous crimes of an era not known for its gentleness, portrayed in the same light. We might understand this as another small contribution to the broader project of revising the history of Western colonialism so as to justify the next phase.

<P>Apple's colleague David Broder, the renowned liberal columnist of the <CITE>Washington Post,</CITE> added further reflections. "The real danger is that US troops may be caught in an ongoing civil war between heavily armed gangs bent on revenge or determined not to yield power." On one side of this bitter conflict, we find the unarmed peasants and slum-dwellers who dared to elect a populist President, "whose commitment to democracy is unproven" -- or at least we find their mutilated corpses. On the other side, trembling in fear, stand the U.S.-armed and -trained military and police with the criminal gangs they have organized in the familiar Duvalierist style, and their backers and beneficiaries, the wealthy families who own the country together with their U.S. associates. Truly a cosmic struggle.

<P>U.S. forces in Haiti are not the first to confont challenges and dilemmas of such severity. Similar problems were faced by the Soviet troops entering Prague in 1968, trying to mediate between the Stalinist security forces and the people calling for freedom and democracy, two "heavily armed gangs determined not to yield power." Or the U.S. forces who liberated Buchenwald, and faced "the real danger" that the SS troops and the half-alive skeletons, each with their "homicidal tendencies," might continue their "ongoing civil war."

<P>In the light of the threats so graphically depicted by the commentators in the national press, we can understand why "The first major arms raid by American troops was for searching not for weapons hidden by attaches, the armed thugs propping up Haiti's military government, but for guns supposedly held by supporters of the man the Americans had come to put back in office, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide" (Kifner). The October 2 raid was based on information unearthed by U.S. Army intelligence. Its source was "a well-known attache," "regarded locally as a drug dealer and paramilitary leader," who directed U.S. forces to "a terrorist training camp stashed full of weapons" -- which turned out to be a property owned by Katherine Dunham, where the raiders seeking to disarm the terrorists surprised a dance troupe practicing. Meanwhile the armed attaches who had broken up the anniversary celebration "were still lounging around their corner today by the Normandie Bar in the center of the city. No American soldiers were in the area."

<P>Lying behind the "comic aspects of the search," Kifner observes, "lies a potentially serious problem for the American forces as they feel out their political role here. The army's natural inclination is to protect property and order," a difficult matter in "an extraordinarily bifurcated country, where a tiny elite, whose wealth is largely the product of exploitation and corruption, rules over desperately poor masses" -- a situation not unrelated to policies and actions of the current liberators. It's not too hard to imagine how the problem will be resolved. Basing himself on his analysis of the "ongoing civil war," Broder offers further advice. Clinton should heed "the lesson of Vietnam," he continues: "you don't commit troops until the country is committed to the mission" -- and you understand that no question can conceivably be raised about "the mission" -- again, a stance that does not lack distinguished models. Now that "Clinton has followed the idealistic President Woodrow Wilson in sending American forces to Haiti," we must recall that our last mission of mercy "lasted 19 years." Disciplined intellectuals are not to recall the facts about that "idealistic" intervention and its aftermath, though Haitians remember them all too well.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<H3>5. Restoring Civil Society</H3>

<P>Both in Haiti and the U.S., those who matter understand what is happening well enough. "Senior U.S. officials have initiated large-scale business negotiations with some of the most powerful and wealthy Haitian supporters of the military overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide," Kenneth Freed reported in the <CITE>Los Angeles Times</CITE> as U.S. forces were "supposedly engineering a new political environment to undermine the power of the same anti-democratic elite." One case is General Shelton's arrangements with Haiti's influential Mevs family "about leasing a large waterfront plot for construction of fuel storage tanks and a pipeline." It only makes sense, given that these leading coup backers had already built "a huge new oil depot here to help the army defy the embargo," as the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> had reported earlier.

<P>Parallel arrangements are proceeding with the other wealthy families that had financed fuel shipments, among other techniques to benefit from the "sanctions." The "powerful Haitian clan" of the Mevs "has positioned itself well to keep doing what it does best -- make money," Jose de Cordoba reports in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal.</CITE> The Mevs had met with Aristide in Washington to induce him to "moderate his position and reach out to the tiny, mostly anti-Aristide, Haitian middle class" -- an intriguing notion of "middle," when we consider the proportion of those who own almost all the nation's wealth. Inexplicably, the Mevs have been able "to build a huge tank farm to store fuel" during the embargo, backed by "loans guaranteed by Haiti's Central Bank"; a fairly typical example of "free market" capitalism. They had "profited from their cozy ties to the Duvalier dictatorships," and therefore found it easy to deal with the U.S., and to adapt to the form of "broadly-based democracy" that they see the Clintonites fashioning.

<P>While still "nervous about Aristide," the enlightened business sector is "counting on the Americans," the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> reports. Reasonably enough. Unlike educated Americans, it is not sufficient for them to chant ritual phrases; to pursue their interests, they must attend to historical and institutional facts. This "baronial class" of "several dozen families," generally light-skinned, recognizes that the military forces coming to "restore democracy" will prefer to deal with them -- our kind of folks, after all, unlike the people rotting in the slums. It is "not surprising that the US should do deals with powerful interests," as in the days of the Duvalier family dictatorship when these interests gained their power, benefiting from similar "deals" with the U.S. government and foreign enterprise while the population sank deeper into misery. Why should anything change, now that the traditional benefactors have returned?<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As for the Haitian military, they too expect to hold on to power, Larry Rohter reports in the <CITE>New York Times.</CITE> Realistically again. They too know their history, and are also aware that "There's nothing in the [Carter-Cedras] agreement that details the future" of the puppet government that they established (U.S. Embassy spokesman Schrager). Schrager is referring to the Jonassaint government that the U.S. now treats with as much respect as General Cedras -- though as far as is known, Jonassaint has not yet been invited by Jimmy Carter to teach his Sunday School class. Rohter asserts that "the Cedras camp managed to mislead the United States and its allies for three months and then defy them for nearly a year before reaching the accord with the Carter delegation." Perhaps. They surely didn't mislead anyone paying attention to what was going on in Haiti and Washington.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Clinton's policies have generally been praised as successful, and rightly so. They achieved what the U.S. has sought ever since the disaster of the free election of December 1990. The previous status quo has pretty much been restored, with one vital difference: civil society has been devastated, and its leading figure has (it is hoped) been trained to become more "pragmatic" and "realistic." The way is clear towards restoring the power of the core sector of Civil Society: foreign investors and "enlightened" elements of the Haitian business community, those who are offended by the sight of mutilated corpses as they are driven by in their limousines, preferring that the poor waste away quietly, out of sight, while the remnants perhaps find a place in assembly plants where they may even survive the regimen of democracy and capitalism for a few years, if lucky.

<P>The Clinton administration regularly complains that it has to walk a "fine line." That's true. U.S. military doctrine is unusual, perhaps unique, in holding that U.S. soldiers are not permitted to face any threat. If someone makes a gesture they see as dangerous, they are to call in massive force. Whatever one thinks of the doctrine, it at once disqualifies the U.S. from participation in any operation involving civilians. U.N. peacekeeping forces have radically different rules of engagement, as must any civilized country that participates in operations short of total war. There are cultural and historical reasons for U.S. doctrine, traceable to the Biblical sources that inspired our genocidal forebears and to a history of overwhelming power, contingencies that are likely to bring forth the most ugly features of any society.

<P>It would not be very surprising, then, if the Haitian operations become another catastrophe, like Somalia, in which case respectable commentary will have to shift gear, though only slightly. It is not a difficult chore to trot out the familiar phrases that will explain the failure of our mission of benevolence in this failed society. Perhaps, with luck, the worst will be avoided as U.S. forces reinstate one of the two antagonists in the "ongoing civil war" between the two "heavily armed gangs bent on revenge or determined not to yield power" -- the one that was protected by the tanks and armored cars as the other, with their "homicidal tendencies," sought to demonstrate for democracy on September 30. Following the Guatemalan model, terror can be followed by USAID projects funding FRAPH terrorists as they construct alternatives to the social service sector that arose democratically, and is therefore intolerable to U.S. elites. In my July article on Haiti, I quoted (from the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>) the leader of a now-clandestine pro-Aristide group, who predicted that "the Duvalierist system will continue, with or without the return of Aristide." "The Duvialierists have many fine days ahead of them in this country," another human rights worker said: "People are losing their ability to make things happen here, and it will take many years to reverse that under the best of circumstances." That is how a "broad consensus" of the Pezzullo-Hakim type is established, as both of them understand full well. That is the lesson of "capitalism and democracy," as interpreted by U.S. elites, who despise democracy only slightly more than free market discipline (for themselves).

<H3>6. A Parable for Our Times</H3>

<P>The story of Haiti is far from over. Two hundred years of popular struggles in Haiti teach us a great deal about the commitment to freedom and justice and the depth of its roots. But as of today, Haiti stands almost as a parable of the 500-year record which, if honesty were imaginable, we would describe as a barbarian invasion in which a savage fringe of Western Europe conquered most of the world.

<P>When Columbus landed in Haiti in 1492, it seemed to him a paradise. The extraordinary wealth of the island of Saint-Domingue, the richest colony in the world, was one of the foundations of France's wealth and power. Having won its freedom, Haiti faced the bitter revenge of the great powers, the U.S. taking first place in seeking to crush the upstarts who called for freedom for all people -- and forgetting the 1500 freed slaves from Haiti who had joined in the U.S. war of independence. The reasons were understood very well by French diplomat Talleyrand, who wrote to James Madison in 1805 that "The existence of a Negro people in arms, occupying a country it has soiled by the most criminal acts, is a horrible spectacle for all white nations," particularly one that based its "free market" economic development on slavery to provide cheap cotton, and that was then engaged in exterminating or expelling the indigenous population. Talleyrand was formulating an early version of the "rotten apple theory" (in its public version, the "domino theory"), which has played a leading role in post-World War II history.

<P>Haitian historian Patrick Bellegarde-Smith writes that "Haiti was the first nation in the world to argue the case of universal freedom for all humankind, revealing the limited definition of freedom adopted by the French and American revolutions." Words worth pondering.

<P>In 1915, as Woodrow Wilson was planning his "idealistic" operation to ensure that U.S. banks and businesses would take over Haiti's financial and natural resources, historian William MacCorkle was still able to write that the island had "within its shores more natural wealth than any other territory of similar size in the world." Whatever the truth of that estimate, little remained after Wilson's forces had done their work -- apart from profits for U.S. investors and a tiny clique of Haitian collaborators. "The U.S. occupation was supposed to ensure elite control of the Haitian peasantry and foreign control of the Haitian elite," Bellegarde-Smith observes -- to ensure control of Haiti by the central components of Haitian Civil Society, in the proper hierarchic relation. The extreme racism of the occupiers intensified the internal racism of Haitian society, and contributed in other ways to what some call "Haitian fascism."

<P>In one of the many sanctimonious displays that are currently defiling media and journals, <CITE>New York Times</CITE> correspondent Larry Rohter writes that "The Haitian ruling classes have always viewed their country's poor as less than human," something that makes the struggle "hard to comprehend" for Americans ("Compromise is American, Not Haitian"). He is right about the Haitian ruling classes, and is also right to imply that the idealistic Americans -- "now back, still aspiring to do good works" -- have not entirely shared the attitudes of the Haitian ruling classes. The Wilson administration was much more egalitarian, regarding all Haitians as less than human, not just the poor. As for the historical willingness of U.S. power to compromise, we need waste no words.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Wilson's Marines disbanded Haiti's Parliament in 1918 when it refused to ratify the U.S.-imposed Constitution, which permitted purchase of Haitian lands by foreigners, and did not allow it to reconvene for twelve years. The occupier's Constitution was "ratified" in a Marine-run plebiscite that did not even approach the dignity of fraud, another one of our contributions to this country with "no history of democracy," where the current President's "commitment to democracy is unproven."

<P>The atrocities of the idealistic mission, including aerial bombing of a Haitian city, finally reached home, eliciting public protest. A 1927 study of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom recounted such U.S. atrocities as burning men and women alive, summary execution of children, beating and torturing, machine-gunning of civilians, daily shooting of cattle and burning of crops, houses, mills, and so on. It came to be understood that atrocities are best left to local clients, as other imperial powers had long realized. Washington proceeded to create an army that "may have ended forever the possibility of an agrarian revolt against the central authority," anthropologist Sidney Mintz observes, much as it did in the Dominican Republic next door at the same time, and in much the same way. Haitian anthropologist Michel-Rolph Trouillot describes the establishment of "an army to fight the people" as the worst of the legacies of the occupation, which "left the country with two poisoned gifts: a weaker civil society and a solidified state apparatus." Current plans simply continue the process, which has its counterparts through Latin America, and is firmly founded in explicit doctrine.

<P>Haitian historian Dantes Bellegarde describes the period from mid-19th century to 1929 as one of ongoing peasant insurgency, finally defeated by the occupying army, with its overwhelming force advantage. In earlier years, insurgents could retreat into the interior beyond the range of naval bombardment, but the methods of aerial bombardment of civilians pioneered by Wilson, then extended by British imperialists, "rendered that tactic obsolete," Bellergarde-Smith observes. The much-lauded infrastructure projects, such as road construction by forced labor, also served the purpose of centralization of power and pacification.

<P>Since then the U.S. has run Haiti without much interference. The educational system, meanwhile, was taken over by other outsiders, primarily the Catholic church and U.S. Protestant organisations, who are not held responsible for the results, including some 80% illiteracy by 1988. The United States trained and armed the security forces, including the elite Leopard counterinsurgency units of the Duvalier dictatorships. "Development projects" initiated and funded by the U.S. accelerated the displacement of subsistence agriculture in favor of export crops and the agribusiness industry. Haiti was considered a fine place to invest, because a "skilled labor force with excellent work attitudes is abundant and available and at remarkably low cost" (Report of Haitian Assembly Industry Association to U.S. corporations). Ample terror was available to eliminate such deviations from free market principles as unions, minimal wage laws, and safety regulations. As democracy is restored by Clinton's intervention, Aristide's earlier proposal to increase the Haitian minimum wage has become a "non-issue," World Bank official Axel Peuker observes, and other social measures are "not on the agenda," he said, as we march towards "democracy and capitalism."

<P>Throughout this period "economic health" improved in the technical sense, along with starvation, infant mortality, and other human disasters, while real wages plummeted. By the early 1970s, people began to flee, as hundreds of thousands had under Wilson's occupation, and as they do en masse elsewhere in the Caribbean domains of U.S. power -- for unknown reasons. The refugees were forcefully returned under Carter, increasingly so under a Reagan-Duvalier agreement. The recent record is familiar.

<P>Meanwhile ecological destruction continues as a consequence of development policies and prevailing systems of social control. Some analysts predict that the remaining forest cover may disappear in a few years, leading to erosion of the remaining fertile soils and disappearance of the water supply. Within our lifetimes, the paradise that Columbus found and that enriched Europe may become a desert, virtually devoid of life.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It's never too late to arrest that fate. If it comes about, the powerful will have no difficulty absolving themselves of any responsibility; those who have benefited from a good education can write the script right now. If it comes about, we will have only ourselves to blame.

<P>We are approaching the five-year mark since the fall of the Berlin wall, which marked the definitive end of the Cold War. At last the United States was freed from the burden of defending the world against Russian aggression and could return to its traditional calling: to promote democracy, human rights, and free markets worldwide. Standard doctrine holds further that the promise has been fulfilled. Today "American motives are largely humanitarian," historian David Fromkin declares in the <CITE>New York Times Magazine.</CITE> The present danger is excess of benevolence; we might undertake yet another selfless mission of mercy, failing to understand that "there are limits to what outsiders can do" and that "the armies we dispatch to foreign soil for humanitarian reasons" may not be able "to save people from others or from themselves."

<P>The view is shared by the leading establishment critic of Cold War policies, George Kennan, who writes that it was a historic error for the US to reject any effort to negotiate a peaceful settlement of conflicts with the Russians for 40 years; one of the benefits of the end of the Cold War is that the clouds are finally lifting on these issues. Kennan too counsels that we restrict our foreign engagements. We must bear in mind that "it is primarily by example, never by precept, that a country such as ours exerts the most useful influence beyond its border"; countries unlike ours may undertake the grubbier pursuits. We must also remember "that there are limits to what one sovereign country can do to help another," even "a country such as ours." Others question that stance on the grounds that it is unfair to deprive suffering humanity of our attention, necessarily benevolent.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.1" HREF="#FN1.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>To qualify for membership in respectable society, one must appreciate a simple thesis: we are perfect. Therefore we need only ask what is the right course for a saintly power, how best we may proceed to "save people from others or from themselves" -- not from us, surely. The tune is, in fact, a very familiar one, an interesting topic for some other time.

<P>Like earlier angelic powers, we are able to recognize that there are some flaws and errors in the record. But the sophisticated understand that history can teach no lessons about our institutions and the ways they have functioned, surely nothing about what may lie ahead. Review of the historical record is nothing more than "sound-bites and invectives about Washington's historically evil foreign policy," Brown University professor Thomas Weiss writes with derision, hence "easy to ignore."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.2" HREF="#FN1.2">2</A></FONT></SUP> A perceptive comment, accurately discerning the most valued principles of the commissar culture.

<P>Discussion of the fashionable topic of the moral obligation of humanitarian intervention -- not a trivial question -- is rarely tainted by concerns about such matters. We do not, of course, counsel that Iran should undertake humanitarian intervention in Bosnia, as it has offered to do. Why? Because of its record and the nature of its institutions. In the case of Iran -- or anyone else -- inquiry into these questions is appropriate. But not for us, given our necessary perfection.

<P>It follows that any departures from the path of righteousness can only have been a reaction -- perhaps excessive, though understandable -- to terrible dangers from which we defended ourselves, and more recently, the entire civilized world. The Cold War provides the favored current formula: any lapse in recent years is attributable to the cosmic struggle with the Russians. Thus if experimental subjects for radiation studies were chosen from Boston's Fernald School for mentally retarded children, not an elite prep school, that was unfortunate, but understandable in the atmosphere of the Cold War, so it is alleged -- about as plausibly as in most other cases. And we have now "changed course," so that history may rest in peace.

<P>At the critical extreme, we do find occasional notice of imperfection. "There's something troubling about the way we select our cases for intervention," Harvard historian Stanley Hoffmann observed in opening a conference at Tufts university. He noted that there has been no "international cry to intervene in ethnic bloodshed in East Timor," the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> reported. The example is instructive.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.3" HREF="#FN1.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Let us disregard the phrase "ethnic bloodshed," not quite the term applied to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. That aside, some obvious questions come to mind: just who might call for such intervention, and how should it proceed? By bombing Washington and London, the main supporters of Indonesia's aggression and mass slaughter? Suppose that a commentator in pre-Gorbachev Russia had found something troubling about Soviet intervention policy, wondering why Russia did not intervene to prevent the imposition of martial law in Poland or repression in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Would we even laugh? How could Moscow intervene to bar the policies it actively supported? These questions cannot arise, however, in our case, whatever the facts, given our perfection. No one laughs.

<P>Respectable British opinion is scarcely different. Writing in the (London) <CITE>Times Higher Education Supplement,</CITE> Leslie Macfarlane, emeritus politics fellow at St. John's College in Oxford, recognizes that the US and UK, "to their shame, failed to put pressure on President Suharto to refrain from invasion" of East Timor. But the 200,000 or more deaths "cannot be attributed to `the West'," he adds, reproaching Edward Herman for his calculations of the costs of Western state terrorism which erroneously included this case: no "Western promotion or support for the invasion and pacification of East Timor in the early 1980s [sic] is laid at the West's door," Macfarlane instructs us with proper indignation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.4" HREF="#FN1.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>There is no need to review the facts, familiar outside of the doctrinal system, which not only suppressed them with great efficiency as the terrible story unfolded but continues to do so today. Right now, Western oil companies are plundering East Timor's oil under a treaty between Australia and Indonesia, terror and repression continue unabated, and new atrocities have been discovered from the very recent past, among them, the slaughter of many people by Indonesian doctors in hospitals after the November 1991 Dili massacre. But we must understand that the news room is a busy place, and some things inevitably seep through the cracks -- in a remarkably systematic way. Who can be expected to notice prominent stories in the British and Australian press, including even the <CITE>Guardian Weekly,</CITE> widely circulated here? One wonders whether the news room would have been too busy to notice Libyan robbery of Kuwaiti oil under a treaty with Saddam Hussein, after he had occupied and annexed the country.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.5" HREF="#FN1.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the United States, public protest has hampered government support for Indonesian atrocities, but not much. Congress cut off funds for military training, but the Clinton Administration was undeterred. On the anniversary of the US-backed Indonesian invasion, the State Department announced that "Congress's action did not ban Indonesia's purchase of training with its own funds," so it can proceed despite the ban. Such training has, after all, been quite successful in the past, including the training of officers who took part in the highly praised slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people, mostly landless peasants, as the present government took power in 1965. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara took particular pride in that fact, informing LBJ that US military assistance to the Indonesian army had "encouraged it" to undertake the useful slaughter "when the opportunity was presented." Particularly valuable, McNamara said, was the program that brought Indonesian military personnel to the United States for training at universities. Congress agreed, noting the "enormous dividends" of US military training of the killers and continued communication with them. The same training expedited the war crimes in Timor, and much else.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.6" HREF="#FN1.6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Plainly, it would be unfair to deprive the people of the region of such benefits. That is exactly the position taken by advocates of US military training, for example Senator Bennett Johnson. His evidence is a quote from the Commander of the US forces in the Pacific, Admiral Larson, who explains that "by studying in our schools," Indonesian army officers "gain an appreciation for our value system, specifically respect for human rights, adherence to democratic principles, and the rule of law." For similar reasons, we must allow arms sales to Indonesia, so that we can continue to have a constructive "dialogue" and maintain our "leverage and influence," so benignly exercised in the past, much as in Latin America, Haiti, the Philippines, and other places where US training has instilled such admirable respect for human rights.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.7" HREF="#FN1.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<H3>1. Defending Human Rights</H3>

<P>With the support of Senate Democrats, the Administration was also able to block human rights conditions on aid to Indonesia. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced further that Washington would "suspend" its annual review of Indonesian labor practices. Agreeing with Senator Bennett, who is impressed by "the steps Indonesia has taken...to improve conditions for workers in Indonesia," Kantor commended Indonesia for "bringing its labor law and practice into closer conformity with international standards" -- a witticism that is in particularly poor taste, though it must be conceded that Indonesia did take some steps forward, fearing that Congress might override its friends in the White House. "Reforms hastily pushed through by the Indonesian government in recent months include withdrawing the authority of the military to intervene in strikes, allowing workers to form a company union to negotiate labour contracts, and raising the minimum wage in Jakarta by 27%" to about $2 a day, the London <CITE>Guardian</CITE> reports. The new company unions that are magnanimously authorized must, to be sure, join the All-Indonesia Labor Union, the state-run union. To ensure that these promising advances toward international labor standards would not be misunderstood, authorities also arrested 21 labor activists.

<P>"We have done much to change and improve," Indonesia's Foreign Minister said, "so according to us there is no reason to revoke" the trade privileges. Clinton liberals evidently agree.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.8" HREF="#FN1.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>One effect of the activism of the 1960s was the pressure on Congress to impose human rights conditions on aid, trade, and military sales. Every Administration from Carter until today has had to seek ways to evade such constraints. In the 1980s, it became a sick joke, as the Reaganites regularly assured Congress (always happy to be "deceived") that its favorite assassins and torturers were making impressive progress. Clinton is forging no new paths with his Indonesia chicanery.

<P>Other tasks are proving harder, however, notably China, which must have its Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status renewed by June. As I've reviewed in earlier articles, China is not giving poor Clinton much help in his endeavor to bypass the executive order that he issued imposing human rights conditions -- in "fear that Congressional Democrats might otherwise have forced an even more stringent approach" through legislation, Thomas Friedman reports in the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> and because Clinton "did not want to appear to be going back on another campaign promise," having "strongly criticized President Bush for `coddling' China."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.9" HREF="#FN1.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The problem arose again as Warren Christopher visited Beijing in March to express Washington's concerns on human rights, which, the State Department hastened to explain, are quite limited -- in fact, limited to finding means to evade Congressional pressures. John Shattuck, US assistant secretary of human rights, clarified to the Chinese leaders that Clinton's requirements for improvement are "very narrow," that pledges of progress may be enough: "What the president is looking for is an indication of direction...that is generally forward looking." Please, please, give us some straw, so that we can respond to the needs of our constituency in the corporate sector. The Chinese, however, seem to enjoy watching their partners twist in the wind.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.10" HREF="#FN1.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As Christopher left for China, the Administration announced that it would once again relax the sanctions on high technology transfers, this time by allowing the Hughes Aircraft Company to launch a satellite from China. This "gesture of good will toward Beijing" is one "part of the strategy to engage China rather than to isolate it," Elaine Sciolino reported in the <CITE>New York Times.</CITE> Asked about this decision while China is under pressure on issues of missile proliferation and human rights, Christopher responded that it "simply sends a signal of even-handed treatment." The "good will gesture," as usual, is directed towards a leading segment of the publicly subsidized "private enterprise" system, much like the "good-will gestures" announced at the Asia-Pacific summit last November, which allowed China to purchase supercomputers, nuclear power generators, and satellites despite their adaptability to weapons and missile proliferation. The Pentagon also sent high officials with Christopher "to discuss ways to upgrade the two countries' military relationship," Sciolino reported, another part of the "strategy."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.11" HREF="#FN1.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Christopher did not return empty-handed. At a White House session, Thomas Friedman reports, he "presented a chart...showing that on many fronts China was making some progress toward meeting the terms of the President's executive order, but that forward movement had been obscured by the confrontational atmosphere of his visit." On leaving Beijing, he had stated that his discussions with the Chinese leaders were "businesslike and productive." "The differences between China and the US are narrowing somewhat," Christopher informed the press, though he "was hard put to point to examples of specific progress on the vexed human rights issue beyond a memorandum of understanding on trade in prison labour products," the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> commented. China did (once again) agree to restrict exports from prison factories to the United States.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.12" HREF="#FN1.12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Such exports have greatly exercised Washington and the press, the sole labor rights issue to have achieved this status. "U.S. Inspections of Jail Exports Likely in China," a front-page story by Thomas Friedman was headlined in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> in January. The Chinese "agreed to a demand to allow more visits by American customs inspectors to Chinese prison factories to make sure they are not producing goods for export to the United States," he reported from Beijing. US influence is having further benign effects, "forcing liberalization, factory by factory," including contract, bankruptcy, and other laws that are "critical elements of a market economy," all welcome steps towards a "virtuous circle."

<P>Unmentioned are a few other questions about economic virtue: horrifying labor conditions, for example. Perhaps the case of 81 women burned to death locked into their factory last November, which merited a few lines in the national press in the midst of much euphoria about Clinton's grand vision of a free market future in the Asia-Pacific region. Or 60 workers killed in a fire a few weeks later in another foreign-owned factory. Or the doubling of deaths in industrial accidents last year, with over 11,000 just in the first eight months. "Chinese officials and analysts say the accidents stem from abysmal working conditions, which, combined with long hours, inadequate pay, and even physical beatings, are stirring unprecedented labor unrest among China's booming foreign joint ventures," Sheila Tefft reported in the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor.</CITE> That problem is a real one: "the tensions reveal the great gap between competitive foreign capitalists lured by cheap Chinese labor and workers weaned on socialist job security and the safety net of cradle-to-grave benefits." Workers do not yet understand that in the capitalist utopia we are preparing for them, they are to be "beaten for producing poor quality goods, fired for dozing on the job during long work hours" and other such misdeeds, and locked into their factories to be burned to death. But we understand all of that, so China is not called to account for violations of labor rights; only for exporting prison products to the United States.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.13" HREF="#FN1.13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Why the distinction? Simplicity itself. Prison factories are state-owned industry, and exports to the US interfere with profits, unlike locking women into factories, beating workers, and other such means to improve the balance sheet. QED.

<P>Accuracy requires a few qualifications. Thus, the rules allow the United States to sell prison goods -- for export: they are not permitted to enter US markets. California and Oregon export prison-made clothing to Asia, including specialty jeans, shirts, and a line of shorts quaintly called "Prison Blues." The prisoners earn far less than the minimum wage, and work under "slave labor" conditions, prison rights activists allege. But their products do not interfere with the rights that count, so there is no problem here.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.14" HREF="#FN1.14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Clinton Administration "has been quietly signaling Beijing that if it met Washington's minimum human rights demands, the United States would consider ending the annual threat of trade sanctions to change China's behavior," Friedman reports. The reason is that the old human rights policy imposed by Congressional (ultimately popular) pressures is "outmoded and should be replaced." This is a "major shift in policy which reflects the increasing importance of trade to the American economy." The human rights policy "is also outmoded, other officials argue, because trade is now such an important instrument for opening up Chinese society, for promoting the rule of law and the freedom of movement there, and for encouraging" private property.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.15" HREF="#FN1.15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The hypocrisy is stunning, though hardly more than the "human rights" policy that is now "outmoded," which was always carefully crafted to avoid endangering profits and to somehow "not see" huge atrocities carried out by US clients under Washington's sponsorship. Human rights concerns have been a passion in the case of Nicaragua and Cuba, subjected to crushing embargoes and terror. In such cases, trade is not "an instrument" that induces good behavior. The criminals have to be restored to their service role; if cynical posturing about human rights contributes to that end, well and good. The same was true of the Soviet empire, which also had to be returned to its traditional Third World role, providing resources, investment opportunities, markets, cheap labor, and other amenities, as it had for hundreds of years (an essential feature of the Cold War since 1918, in the real world). Until that end was achieved, trade was not "an instrument" to help lift the chains. The same was true of China, until it began to open its doors to foreign investment and control, offering wonderful opportunities for profit -- or in technical Newspeak, "jobs."

<H3>2. Promoting Democracy</H3>

<P>Our current vocation, as everyone knows, is promoting democracy. There are many illuminating examples since the fall of the Berlin Wall freed us from the Cold War burden.

<P>The first, and one of the most revealing, is Nicaragua. Recall that just as the Wall fell, the White House and Congress announced with great clarity that unless Nicaraguans voted as we told them, the terrorist war and the embargo that was strangling the country would continue. Washington also voted (alone with Israel) against a UN General Assembly resolution calling on it once again to observe international law and call off these illegal actions; unthinkable of course, so the press continued to observe its vow of silence. When Nicaraguans met their obligations a few months later, joy was unrestrained. At the dissident extreme, Anthony Lewis hailed Washington's "experiment in peace and democracy," which gives "fresh testimony to the power of Jefferson's idea: government with the consent of the governed.... To say so seems romantic, but then we live in a romantic age." Across the spectrum there was rejoicing over the latest of the "happy series of democratic surprises," as <CITE>Time</CITE> magazine expressed the uniform view while outlining the methods used to achieve our Jeffersonian ideals: to "wreck the economy and prosecute a long and deadly proxy war until the exhausted natives overthrow the unwanted government themselves," with a cost to us that is "minimal," leaving the victim "with wrecked bridges, sabotaged power stations, and ruined farms," and providing Washington's candidate with "a winning issue," ending the "impoverishment of the people of Nicaragua."

<P>It would be hard to imagine a more conclusive demonstration of the understanding of "democracy" in the dominant political and intellectual culture. It is inconceivable that the clear and unmistakeable meaning of any of this should enter the respectable culture, or probably even history.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.16" HREF="#FN1.16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>That interesting story continues. On March 15, US assistant Secretary of State Alexander Watson announced that "With the conflicts of the past behind us, the Clinton administration accepts the Sandinistas as a legitimate political force in Nicaragua with all the rights and obligations of any party in a democracy supposing that it uses only peaceful and legitimate methods," as we did through the 1980s, setting the stage for a "fair election," by US standards. The brief Reuters report noted that "the United States financed the Contra rebels against the Soviet-backed Sandinista government." Translating from Newspeak, Washington followed standard procedure, doing everything it could to compel Nicaragua to abandon its despicable efforts to maintain a nonaligned stand and balanced trade and to turn to the Russians as a last resort, so that Washington's attack could be construed as part of the Cold War conflict raging in our backyard, now to be dispatched to the category of irrelevance for understanding ourselves, or what the future holds.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.17" HREF="#FN1.17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Washington's willingness to accept the Sandinistas as a legitimate political force, if they mind their manners, cannot claim the prize for moral cowardice and depravity. That is still held by Washington's display of magnanimity towards the Vietnamese, now permitted to enter the civilized world, their many crimes against us put to the side (though not, of course, forgiven) once US business made it clear that the pleasure of torturing our victims must give way to the more important task of enrichment of the wealthy.

<P>The next example of our post-Cold War passion for democracy was the invasion of Panama a month after the Berlin Wall fell, the first exercise of humanitarian intervention in the post-Cold War era. Operation Just Cause may have served as a model for Saddam Hussein shortly after, the cheering section now quietly concedes. Bush's greatest fear when Iraq invaded Kuwait seems to have been that Saddam would mimic his achievement in Panama. According to the account of Washington planning by investigative reporter Bob Woodward, regarded as "generally convincing" by US government Middle East specialist William Quandt, President Bush feared that the Saudis would "bug out at the last minute and accept a puppet regime in Kuwait" after Iraqi withdrawal. His advisers expected that Iraq would withdraw, leaving behind "lots of Iraqi special forces in civilian clothes," if not armed forces as the US did in Panama, while taking over two uninhabited mudflats that had been assigned to Kuwait in the British imperial settlement to block Iraq's access to the sea (Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf). Chief of Staff Gen. Colin Powell warned that the status quo would be changed under the influence of the aggressors even after withdrawal, again as in Panama.

<P>In a highly-praised academic study regarded as the standard current work of scholarship on this "textbook case of aggression" and the reaction to it, University of London historians Lawrence Freedman and Efraim Karsh, who labor to present the US-UK effort in the most favorable possible light, conclude that "Saddam apparently intended neither officially to annex the tiny emirate nor to maintain a permanent military presence there. Instead, he sought to establish hegemony over Kuwait, ensuring its complete financial, political and strategic subservience to his wishes," much as intended by the US in Panama, and achieved. Saddam's scheme "turned sour," they continue, because of the international reaction; to translate to doctrinally unacceptable truth, because the US and Britain did not follow their usual practice of vetoing or otherwise nullifying the international reaction to such "textbook cases of aggression" as US-South Vietnam, Turkey-Cyprus, Indonesia-East Timor, Israel-Lebanon, US-Panama, and many others.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.18" HREF="#FN1.18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Operation Just Cause was presented as a "textbook case" of Washington's dedication to democracy -- quite accurately, as it turned out. In the latest of its annual reports on human rights (January, 1994), Panama's governmental Human Rights Commission charged that the right to self-determination and sovereignty of the Panamanian people continues to be violated by the "state of occupation by a foreign army," reviewing US army, airforce, and DEA operations in Panama, including a DEA agent's assault on a Panamanian journalist and attacks on Panamanian citizens by US military personnel. The nongovernmental Human Rights Commission, in its accompanying report "Democracy and Human Rights in Panama...Four Years Later" added that democracy has meant nothing more than formal voting while government policies "do not attend to the necessities of the most impoverished" -- whose numbers have significantly increased since the "liberation." Within a year after the invasion, Latin Americanist Stephen Ropp observes, Washington was well aware "that removing the mantle of United States protection would quickly result in a civilian or military overthrow of [President] Endara and his supporters"-- that is, the puppet regime of bankers, businessmen, and narcotraffickers installed by the occupying army. "Drugs and their rewards are more visible today than in General Noriega's time," the <CITE>Economist</CITE> reports in March, including hard drugs. A senior employee of the Panama Branch of Merrill Lynch was one of those recently caught in a DEA operation as they were laundering Colombian cocaine cash through Panama's large financial industry, the one real economic success story of the "occupation by a foreign army." "All they were doing is what almost every bank in Panama does," a local investigative reporter commented. All exactly as predicted when the troops landed to restore the mainly white oligarchy to power and ensure US control over the strategically important region and its financial institutions.

<P>An election is scheduled for May. Far ahead in polls is Perez Balladares, the candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), the party of populist dictator Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega. Balladares was Noriega's campaign manager for the 1989 election that Noriega stole, causing much outrage in the US because he was no longer following Washington's orders; when he was still a "good boy" in 1984, he was lauded by Reagan, Shultz, et al. for stealing the election with considerably greater fraud and violence. Balladares has learned his lessons and should cause no problems.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.19" HREF="#FN1.19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Other exercises of "democracy enhancement" in the region proceed on course. In November 1993, Hondurans went to the polls for the fourth time since 1980. They voted against the neoliberal structural adjustment programs that have had the usual consequences. But the gesture is empty; the rich and powerful will permit nothing else. "The voters have no real options for improving their living standards which worsen every day," Mexico's major newspaper <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> reported -- familiar with "economic miracles" in its own country. Three-fourths of those who went to the polls "live in misery and are disenchanted with formal democracy." Hondurans' purchasing power is lower than in the 1970s, before the gift of "democracy" was granted by the United States while turning Honduras into a military base for its war against Nicaragua and establishing more firmly the rule of the generals. There are other beneficiaries, the Honduran College of Economists points out: "a group of privileged exporters and local investors linked to financial capital and multinational corporations who have multiplied their capital" in a country where "growing economic polarization is generating ever more evident constrasts, between the rich who do not hide the ostentation of their moral misery and the every more miserable poor." "At least one of every two dollars coming to Honduras has left in the last three years [1991-93] to pay the interest on more than $3 billion foreign debt," <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> continues. Debt service now represents 40% of exports; and though almost 20% of the debt was forgiven, it has increased by almost 10% since 1990.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.20" HREF="#FN1.20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In March 1994, the "democracy enhancement" project reached El Salvador. The elections conducted in the 1980s to legitimize the US-backed terror state were hailed at the time as impressive steps towards democracy ("demonstration elections," as Edward Herman accurately called them). But with the policy imperatives of those days gone, the pretense has been quietly shelved. It is the 1994 elections that are to represent the triumph of Washington's dedication to democracy.

<P>The elections are indeed an innovation in that at least the forms were maintained, pretty much. "Tens of thousands of voters who had electoral cards were unable to vote because they did not appear on electoral lists," the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> reported, "while some 74,000 people, a high number of which were from areas believed to be sympathetic to the FMLN, were excluded because they did not have birth certificates." FMLN leaders alleged that more than 300,000 voters were excluded in such ways, charging "massive" fraud. The left coalition presidential candidate Rubn Zamora estimated "conservatively" that over 10% of voters were barred. The UN mission downplayed the problems, but independent observers were not convinced. "I used to give them the benefit of the doubt," the official British observer commented, "but it comes to the point when you have to say it is bad faith," referring to the "bad administration" of the election by the governing ARENA party, which received almost half the votes cast, and the UN mission reaction.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.21" HREF="#FN1.21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>But the irregularities, whatever they may have been, do not change the fact that the elections broke new ground at a formal level. There was no blatant fraud or massive terror; rather, minor fraud against the background of the successful use of terror and repression, with a narrow aspect that received some attention, and a broader and more significant one that did not.

<P>In the 1994 elections, the US naturally supported ARENA, the party of the death squads, a fact understood throughout though denied for propaganda reasons. Partial declassification of documents has revealed that much. It also illustrates once again why documents are classified in the first place: not for security reasons, as alleged, but to undermine American democracy by protecting state power from popular scrutiny. In February 1985 the CIA reported that "behind ARENA's legitimate exterior lies a terrorist network led by D'Aubuisson and funded by wealthy Salvadoran expatriates residing in Guatemala and the United States," using "both active-duty and retired military personnel in their campaigns"; "death squads in the armed forces operate out of both urban military headquarters and rural outposts." The main death squad, the "Secret Anti-Communist Army," was described by the CIA as the "paramilitary organization" of ARENA, led by the Constituent Assembly security chief and drawing most of its members from the National Police and other security forces. The military and police themselves, of course, were the major terrorist forces, carrying out the great mass of the atrocities against the civilian population, funded directly from Washington, which was also responsible for their training and direction.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.22" HREF="#FN1.22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As the 1994 elections approached, there was a "resurgence in death squad-style murders and death threats," Americas Watch observed, concluding that "no issue represents a greater threat to the peace process than the rise in political murders of leaders and grassroots activists" of the FMLN, assassinations that "became more frequent, brazen, and selective in the fall of 1993." These "injected a level of fear, almost impossible to measure, into the campaign," enhanced by government cover-ups and refusal to investigate, part of a pattern of violation of the peace treaty, to which we return. The government's own human rights office and the UN Observer Mission reported the "grave deterioration in citizen security" made worse by "organized violence in the political arena." This proceeds against the backdrop of an "astronomical rise of crime in post-war El Salvador," Americas Watch reports, and "reliable" evidence that the army and National Police are involved in organized crime.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.23" HREF="#FN1.23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The major political opposition, Rubn Zamora's left coalition, not only lacked resources for the campaign that was virtually monopolized by ARENA, but was "unable to convince supporters or sympathizers to appear in campaign ads because they fear retaliation from the right" (<CITE>New York Times</CITE>). Terror continued at a level sufficient to give substance to such fears. Among those who took the threat seriously was Jos Mar!a Mendez, named El Salvador's "Lawyer of the Century" by three prestigious legal associations. He fled the country shortly after, threatened with death unless he convinced the vice-presidential candidate of the left coalition to resign.

<P>Foreign observers were struck by the lack of popular interest in the "elections of the century." "Salvadorans Ambivalent Toward Historic Poll," a headline in the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE> read, reporting fear and apathy, and concern that war will return unless ARENA wins. The abstention rate, about 45%, was about the same as 10 years earlier, at the peak of the violence. A "conservative political analyst" quoted by the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> (Hctor Dada) attributed the low participation "to a deliberate disenfranchisment of voters and a sense of apathy among the electorate." As for those who voted, another analyst, Luis Cardenal, observed that "the electorate voted more than anything for tranquillity, for security." "The war-weary populace bought the ruling party's party line, which equated ARENA with security and the left with instability and violence," <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE> reporter David Clark Scott added. That is plausible enough. Any other outcome could be expected to lead to revival of the large-scale terror and atrocities.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.24" HREF="#FN1.24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>These assessments bear on the broader aspects of the successful use of violence. Before the election, church and popular sources attributed the "climate of apathy" to the fact that "hunger and poverty reign among a population whose demands have received no attention, which makes the electoral climate difficult" (Notimex, Mexico).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.25" HREF="#FN1.25">25</A></FONT></SUP> In the 1970s, popular organizations were proliferating, in part under church auspices, seeking to articulate these demands in the political arena and to work to overcome hunger, poverty, and harsh oppression. It was that popular awakening that elicited the response of the state terror apparatus and its superpower sponsor, committed as always to a form of "democracy enhancement" that bars the threat of democracy -- by extreme violence, if necessary, as in this case. Here as elsewhere, the programs of the terrorist superpower were highly successful, leading to the "climate of apathy," the search for security above all else, and the general conditions in which "free elections" become tolerable.

<P>Recall the conclusion of Reaganite official Thomas Carothers, who recognizes that the "democracy enhancement" programs in which he was involved "inevitably sought only limited, top-down forms of democratic change that did not risk upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied," maintaining "the basic order of...quite undemocratic societies" and avoiding "populist-based change" that might upset "established economic and political orders" and open "a leftist direction." Nothing has changed in this regard.

<P>A January 1994 conference of Jesuits and lay associates in San Salvador considered both the narrow and broad aspects of the state terrorist project. Its summary report concludes that "It is important to explore to what degree terror continues to act, cloaked by the mask of common crime. Also to be explored is what weight the culture of terror has had in domesticating the expectations of the majority vis-a-vis alternatives different to those of the powerful, in a context in which many of the revolutionaries of yesterday act today with values similar to the long powerful."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.26" HREF="#FN1.26">26</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The latter issue, the broader one, is of particular significance. The great achievement of the massive terror operations of the past years organized by Washington and its local associates has been to destroy hope. The observation generalizes to much of the Third World and also to the growing masses of superfluous people at home, as the Third World model of sharply two-tiered societies is increasingly internationalized. These are major themes of the "New World Order" being constructed by the privileged sectors of global society, with US state and private power in the lead.

<H3>3. Rewarding Democracy</H3>

<P>A particularly instructive illustration of the democracy enhancement program in the region is Colombia, which seems to have taken first place in the competition for leading terrorist state in Latin America -- and, to the surprise of no one familiar with "sound-bites and invectives about Washington's historically evil foreign policy," has become the leading recipient of US military aid, accompanied by much praise for its stellar accomplishments.

<P>In the March 1994 issue of <CITE>Current History,</CITE> Latin Americanist John Martz writes that "Colombia now enjoys one of the healthiest and most flourishing economies in Latin America. And in political terms its democratic structures, notwithstanding inevitable flaws, are among the most solid on the continent," a model of "well-established political stability." The Clinton Administration is particularly impressed by outgoing President Csar Gaviria, whom it is now promoting as next Secretary General of the Organization of American States, because, as the US representative to the OAS explained, "He has been very forward looking in building democratic institutions in a country where it was sometimes dangerous to do so" and also "on economic reform in Colombia and on economic integration in the hemisphere," code words that are readily interpreted.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.27" HREF="#FN1.27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>That it has been dangerous to build democratic institutions in Colombia is true enough, thanks primarily to President Gaviria, his predecessors, and their fervent supporters in Washington.

<P>The "inevitable flaws" are reviewed in some detail -- once again -- in current publications of Americas Watch and Amnesty International.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.28" HREF="#FN1.28">28</A></FONT></SUP> They find "appalling levels of violence," the worst in the hemisphere. Since 1986, more than 20,000 people have been killed for political reasons, most of them by the Colombian military and police and the paramilitary forces that are closely linked to them; for example, the private army of rancher, emerald dealer, and reputed drug dealer Victor Carranza, considered to be the largest in the country, dedicated primarily to the destruction of the leftwing political opposition Patriotic Union (UP), in alliance with police and military officers. The department in which Carranza operates (Meta) is one of the most heavily militarized, with some 35,000 troops and thousands of police. Nevertheless, paramilitary forces and hired killers operate freely, carrying out massacres and political assassinations. An official government inquiry in the early '80s found that over a third of the members of paramilitary groups engaged in political killings and other terror in Colombia were active-duty military officers; the pattern continues, including the usual alliances with private power and criminal sectors.

<P>More than 1500 leaders, members and supporters of UP have been assassinated since the party was established in 1985. This "systematic elimination of the leadership" of UP is "the most dramatic expression of political intolerance in recent years," AI observes -- one of the "inevitable flaws" that make it "dangerous to build democratic institutions," if not quite the danger that the Clinton Administration wants us to notice. Other "dangers" were illustrated at the March 1994 elections, largely bought by the powerful Cali cocaine cartel, critics allege, noting the history of vote-buying in this "stable democracy," the vast amounts of money spent by the cartel, and the low turnout.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.29" HREF="#FN1.29">29</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The pretext for terror operations is the war against guerrillas and narcotraffickers, the former a very partial truth, the latter "a myth," Amnesty International concludes in agreement with other investigators; the myth was concocted in large measure to replace the "Communist threat" as the Cold War was fading along with the propaganda system based on it. In reality, the official security forces and their paramilitary associates work hand in glove with the drug lords, organized crime, landowners, and other private interests in a country where avenues of social action have long been closed, and are to be kept that way by intimidation and terror. The Government's own Commission to Overcome Violence concluded that "the criminalization of social protest" is one of the "principal factors which permit and encourage violations of human rights" by the military and police authorities and their paramilitary collaborators.

<P>The problems have become much worse in the past 10 years, particularly during President Gaviria's term, when "violence reached unprecedented levels," the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) reports, with the National Police taking over as the leading official killers while US aid shifted to them. 1992 was the most violent year in Colombia since the 1950s, WOLA reported in early 1993, which proved to be still worse.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.30" HREF="#FN1.30">30</A></FONT></SUP> Atrocities run the gamut familiar in the spheres of US influence and support: death squads, "disappearance," torture, rape, massacre of civilian populations under the doctrine of "collective responsibility," and aerial bombardment. The specially-trained counterinsurgency and mobile brigades are among the worst offenders. Targets include community leaders, human rights and health workers, union activists, students, members of religious youth organizations, and young people in shanty towns, but primarily peasants. Merely to give one example, from August 1992 to August 1993, 217 union activists were murdered, "a point that demonstrates the strong intolerance on the part of the State of union activity," the Andean Commission of Jurists comments.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.31" HREF="#FN1.31">31</A></FONT></SUP> The official concept of "terrorism" has been extended to virtually anyone opposing government policies, the human rights reports observe.

<P>One project of the security forces and their allies is "social cleansing" -- that is, murder of vagrants and unemployed, street children, prostitutes, homosexuals, and other undesirables. The Ministry of Defense formulated the official attitude toward the matter in response to a compensation claim: "There is no case for the payment of any compensation by the nation, particularly for an individual who was neither useful nor productive, either to society or to his family."

<P>The security forces also murder suspects, another practice familiar in US domains. It is, for example, standard operating procedure for Israeli forces in the occupied territories, passing with little notice among the paymasters, who accept it as routine. Thus, the day before the Hebron massacre of February 25, soldiers fired antitank rockets and grenades at a stone house near Jerusalem, killing one Palestinian and wounding another who were "accused by the army in the slaying of an undercover agent" and other actions, the press casually reported.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.32" HREF="#FN1.32">32</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The plague of murder for sale of organs, rampant through the domains of US influence, has not spared Colombia, where undesirables are killed so that their corpses "can be chopped up and sold on the black market for body parts" (AI). It is not known whether children are sold and killed for organ transplants as in El Salvador, where the practice is officially conceded; and according to extensive report, elsewhere in the region.

<P>As Human Rights groups and others observe, the Colombian model is that of El Salvador and Guatemala. The doctrines instilled by US advisers and trainers can be traced back directly to the Nazis, as Michael McClintock documented in an important study that has been ignored. Colombia has also enjoyed the assistance of British, German, and Israeli mercenaries who train assassins and perform other services for the narco-military-landlord combine in their war against peasants and potential social activism. to my knowledge, there has been no attempt to investigate the report of Colombian intelligence that North Americans have also been engaged in these operations, or any notice of it, in the mainstream.

<P>Other similarities to Washington's Salvador-Guatemala model abound. Consider, for example, the case of Major Luis Felipe Becerra, charged with responsibility for an army massacre by a civilian judge, who fled the country under death threats days after issuing the arrest warrant (her father was then murdered). But the warrants were not served, because Major Becerra was then in the United States undergoing a training course for promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel. Returning after his promotion, Lt.-Col. Becerra was appointed to head the army's press and public relations department, despite a recommendation by the Procurator Delegate to the Armed Forces that he be dismissed for his part in the peasant massacre. In April 1993, charges against him were dropped. In October, he was again implicated in a massacre of unarmed civilians. Under the pretext of a battle against guerrillas, troops under his command executed 13 people in a rural area; the victims were unarmed, the women were raped and tortured, according to residents of the area.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.33" HREF="#FN1.33">33</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>But impunity prevails, as is regularly the case.

<P>The story is that of Central America, Haiti, Brazil, indeed wherever the Monroe Doctrine extends, along with the Philippines, Iran under the Shah, and other countries that share an elusive property.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.34" HREF="#FN1.34">34</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Whatever could it be? Whatever it is, we are strictly enjoined not to see it and to learn nothing from it.

<P>A detailed 1992 investigation by European and Latin American church and human rights organizations concludes that "state terrorism in Colombia is a reality: it has its institutions, its doctrine, its structures, its legal arrangements, its means and instruments, its victims, and above all its responsible authorities." Its goal is "systematic elimination of opposition, criminalization of large sectors of the population, massive resort to political assassination and disappearance, general use of torture, extreme powers for the security forces, exceptional legislation, etc..." (<CITE>State Terror in Colombia</CITE>). The modern version has its roots in the security doctrines pioneered by the Kennedy Administration, which established them officially in a crucial 1962 decision that shifted the mission of the Latin American military from "hemispheric defense" to "internal security": the war against the "internal enemy," understood in practice to be those who challenge the traditional order of domination and control.

<P>The doctrines were expounded in US manuals of counterinsurgency and low intensity conflict, and developed further by local security authorities. They benefited from training and direction by US advisers and experts, new technologies of repression, and improved structures and methodologies to maintain "stability" and obedience. The result is a highly efficient apparatus of official terror, designed for "total war" by state power "in the political, economic, and social arenas," as the Colombian Minister of Defense articulated the standard doctrine in 1989. While officially the targets were guerrilla organizations, a high military official explained in 1987 that these were only of minor importance: "the real danger" is "what the insurgents have called the political and psychological war," the war "to control the popular elements" and "to manipulate the masses." The "subversives" hope to influence unions, universities, media, and so on. Therefore, the <CITE>State Terror</CITE> inquiry observes, the "internal enemy" of the state terrorist apparatus extends to "labor organizations, popular movements, indigenous organizations, opposition political parties, peasant movements, intellectual sectors, religious currents, youth and student groups, neighborhood organizations," and so on, all legitimate targets for destruction because they must be secured against undesirable influences. "Every individual who in one or another manner supports the goals of the enemy must be considered a traitor and treated in that manner," a 1963 military manual prescribed, as the Kennedy initiatives were moving into high gear.

<P>The war against the "internal enemy" escalated in the 1980s as the Reaganites updated the Kennedy doctrines, moving from "legal" repression to "systematic employment of political assassination and disappearance, later massacres" (<CITE>State Terror</CITE>). Atrocities escalated. A new judicial regime in 1988 "allowed maximal criminalization of the political and social opposition" in order to implement what was officially called "total war against the internal enemy." The use of paramilitary auxiliaries for terror, explicitly authorized in military manuals, also took new and more comprehensive forms; and alliances with industrialists, ranchers and landowners, and later narcotraffickers were more firmly entrenched. The 1980s saw "the consolidation of state terror in Colombia," the inquiry concludes.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.35" HREF="#FN1.35">35</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In its December 1993 study, America's Watch observes that "most of the materiel used by and training provided the Colombian army and police come from the United States," mainly counterinsurgency equipment and training. A study of the "drug war" by the US General Accounting Office in August 1993 concluded that US military officials have not "fully implemented end-use monitoring procedures to ensure that Colombia's military is using aid primarily for counter-narcotic purposes," an oversight with few consequences, considering what falls under the rubric of "counter-narcotic purposes." Washington's own interpretation of such purposes was nicely illustrated in early 1989 when Colombia asked it to install a radar system to monitor flights from the south, the source of most of the cocaine for the drug merchants. The US government fulfilled the request -- in a sense; it installed a radar system on San Andrs island in the Caribbean, 500 miles from mainland Colombia and as far removed as possible on Colombian territory from the drug routes, but well-located for the intensive surveillance of Nicaragua that was a critical component of the terrorist war, then peaking as Washington sought to conclude its demolition of the "peace process" of the Central American presidents (as it did, another fact unlikely to enter history). A Costa Rican request for radar assistance in the drug war ended up the same way.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.36" HREF="#FN1.36">36</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>>From 1984 through 1992, 6,844 Colombian soldiers were trained under the US International Military Education and Training Program, over 2,000 from 1990 to 1992, as atrocities were mounting. Like their counterparts elsewhere, they were thus able to "gain an appreciation for our value system, specifically respect for human rights, adherence to democratic principles, and the rule of law," as Admiral Larson and Senator Bennett explained. The Colombian program is the largest in the hemisphere, three times that of El Salvador. US advisors are helping build military bases, officially to "increase the battlefronts against the guerrillas and narcotrafficking operations." Four have been constructed, five more are underway, according to the US Embassy. The real targets will be evident from the record elsewhere in the region, or in Colombia itself.

<P>Washington is also supporting the "public order" courts that operate under conditions that severely undermine civil rights and due process. Again, the parallel to El Salvador is obvious. One of the requirements of the UN-brokered peace accord was that the Salvadoran government dismantle the Supreme Court, largely an appendage of the death squad apparatus run by the state and its private sector allies. The agreement was ignored, like the requirement that the National Police, noted for their brutality, be dismantled and replaced by a new National Civilan Police (PNC) that is not under army control and includes the FMLN. "Government figures...show that instead of phasing out the old national police force as called for by the peace accord, it actually has increased by about 2,000 men to 10,500," the <CITE>Chicago Tribune</CITE> reported. In further violation of the agreement, the ARENA government in 1992 transferred to the National Police 1,000 members of the Treasury Police and National Guard, which were to be abolished because of their notorious human rights abuses; former members were accepted to training programs for the PNC, "an explicit violation of the accord," Americas Watch notes. The expanding National Police are considered responsible for 35% of human rights violations reported to the UN observers in 1993, "a larger share than any other force," Americas Watch continues, reviewing also a series of other government violations of the accords designed to sustain the terror system, either in official or "privatized" form. "Time is on the side of the government," a UN official observed: it is only necessary to hold out until the UN Mission ends, and then the remnants of the peace accords can be completely scrapped, going the way of the Central American peace accords of 1987.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.37" HREF="#FN1.37">37</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Since there is no interest here, El Salvador too proceeds towards a "stable democracy," though with "inevitable flaws," such as those already mentioned.

<P>In July 1989 the State Department submitted a report entitled "Justification for Determination to Authorize Export-Import Act Guarantees and Insurance for Sales of Military Equipment to Colombia for Antinarcotics Purposes," the official cover story. The report states: "Colombia has a democratic form of government and does not exhibit a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights." Three months later, the UN Special Rapporteur on Summary Executions, Amos Wako, returned from a visit to Colombia with severe warnings about the extreme violence of the paramilitary forces in coordination with drug lords and government security forces: "There are currently over 140 paramilitary groups operating in Colombia today [which are] trained and financed by drug traffickers and possibly a few landowners. They operate very closely with elements in the armed forces and the police. Most of the killings and massacres carried out by the paramilitary groups occur in areas which are heavily militarized [where] they are able to move easily...and commit murders with impunity. In some cases, the military or police either turn a blind eye to what is being done by paramilitary groups or give suport by offering safe conduct passes to members of the paramilitary or by impeding investigation." His mandate did not extend to the direct terror of the security forces, which far outweighs the depredations of its informal allies.

<P>A few months before the State Department praise for Colombia's humane democracy, a Jesuit-sponsored development and research organization published a report documenting atrocities in the first part of 1988, including over 3000 politically-motivated killings, 273 in "social cleansing" campaigns.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.38" HREF="#FN1.38">38</A></FONT></SUP> Excluding those killed in combat, political killings averaged 8 a day, with seven murdered in their homes or in the street and one "disappeared." "The vast majority of those who have disappeared in recent years," WOLA added, "are grassroots organizers, peasant or union leaders, leftist politicians, human rights workers and other activists," over 1500 by the time of the State Department endorsement. Perhaps the State Department had in mind the recent (1988) mayoral campaigns, in which 29 of the 87 mayoral candidates of the UP were assassinated along with over 100 of its candidates for municipal councilor. The Central Organization of Workers, a coalition of trade unions formed in 1986, had by then lost over 230 members, most of them found dead after brutal torture.

<P>Recall also that in 1988, the more advanced forms of "maximal criminalization of the political and social opposition" were instituted for "total war against the internal enemy," as the regime of state terror consolidated. By the time the State Department report appeared, the methods of control it found praiseworthy were being still more systematically implemented. From 1988 through early 1992, 9500 people were assassinated for political reasons along with 830 disappearances and 313 massacres (between 1988 and 1990) of peasants and poor people.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.39" HREF="#FN1.39">39</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The primary victims of atrocities were, as usual, the poor, mainly peasants. In one southern department, grassroots organizations testified in February 1988 that a "campaign of total annihilation and scorched earth, Vietnam-style," was being conducted by the military forces "in a most criminal manner, with assassinations of men, women, elderly and children. Homes and crops are burned, obligating the peasants to leave their lands." The State Department had a plethora of evidence of this sort before it when it cleared Colombia of human rights violations. Its own official Human Rights reports attributed virtually all violence to the guerrillas and narcotraffickers, so that the US was "justified" in providing the mass murderers and torturers with military equipment, putting our taxes to good use.

<P>That, of course, was the "bad old days" of 1989, when we were still defending civilization from the Russian threat. Moving to the present, matters become worse, for reasons explained by President Gaviria in May 1992. When questioned about atrocities by the military in the Colombian press, he responded that "The battle against the guerrillas must be waged on unequal terms. The defense of human rights, of democratic principles, of the separation of powers, could prove to be an obstacle for the counterinsurgency struggle."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.40" HREF="#FN1.40">40</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>During the Bush years, the US Embassy "did not make a single public statement urging the government to curb political or military abuses," WOLA observes, while US support for the military and police increased.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.41" HREF="#FN1.41">41</A></FONT></SUP> But now that liberal Democrats have taken over, the Clinton Administration has called for a change in policy towards the Colombian killers: more active US participation. For fiscal year 1994, the Administration requested that military financing and training funds be <I>increased</I> by over 12%, reaching about half of proposed military aid for all of Latin America. Congressional budget cuts for the Pentagon interfered with these plans, so the Administration "intends to use emergency drawdown authority to bolster the Colombia account," Americas Watch reports. Congress, however, is continuing to interfere, taking note of "continuing human rights abuses on a large scale" and imposing conditions on US aid, which the Administration will have to find ways to evade, with the usual formulas and devices. The Senate also urged the Colombian Government to permit Red Cross access to police and detention facilities, which it has generally denied.

<P>The Human Rights organizations (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch) are committed to international conventions on human rights. Thus AI reports open by stating that the organization "works to promote all the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international standards." In practice, however, the commitment is skewed in accord with Western standards, which are significantly different. The United States, in particular, rejects the universality of the Universal Declaration, amidst much posturing about our noble defense of the sacred principle of universality and self-righteous denunciation of the "cultural relativism" of the backward peoples who fall short of our exalted standards. The United States has always flatly rejected the sections of the Universal Declaration dealing with social and economic rights, and also consistently disregards, ignores, and violates much of the remainder of the Declaration -- even putting aside its massive involvement in terror, torture, and other abuses.

<P>The Human Rights Groups say little about social and economic rights, generally adopting the highly biased Western perspective on these matters. In the case of Colombia, we have to go beyond these (in themselves, very valuable) reports to discover the roots of the extraordinary violence. They are not obscure. The president of the Colombian Permanent Committee for Human Rights, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfredo V squez Carrizosa, writes that it is "poverty and insufficient land reform" that "have made Colombia one of the most tragic countries of Latin America," and are the source of the violence, including the mass killings of the 1940s and early 1950s, which took hundreds of thousands of lives. Land reform was legislated in 1961, but "has practically been a myth," unimplemented because landowners "have had the power to stop it" in this admirable democracy with its constitutional regime, which V squez Carrizosa dismisses as a "facade," granting rights that have no relation to reality. The violence has been caused "by the dual structure of a prosperous minority and an impoverished, excluded majority, with great differences in wealth, income, and access to political participation."

<P>And as elsewhere in Latin America, "violence has been exacerbated by external factors," primarily the initiatives of the Kennedy Administration, which "took great pains to transform our regular armies into counterinsurgency brigades, accepting the new strategy of the death squads," ushering in "what is known in Latin America as the National Security Doctrine,...not defense against an external enemy, but a way to make the military establishment the masters of the game...[with] the right to combat the internal enemy, as set forth in the Brazilian doctrine, the Argentine doctrine, the Uruguayan doctrine, and the Colombian doctrine: it is the right to fight and to exterminate social workers, trade unionists, men and women who are not supportive of the establishment, and who are assumed to be communist extremists."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.42" HREF="#FN1.42">42</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It is in this precise sense, no other, that the Cold War guided our policies.

<P>The results are an income distribution that is "dramatically skewed," WOLA observes, another striking feature of the domains of longstanding US influence, from which we are, again, to learn nothing. The top three percent of Colombia's landed elite own over 70% of arable land, while 57% of the poorest farmers subsist on under 3%. 40% of Colombians live in "absolute poverty," unable to satisfy basic subsistence needs, according to a 1986 report of the National Administration Bureau of Statistics, while 18% live in "absolute misery," unable to meet nutritional needs. The Colombian Institute of Family Welfare estimates that four and a half million children under 14 are hungry: that is, one of every two children, in this triumph of capitalism, a country of enormous resources and potential, lauded as "one of the healthiest and most flourishing economies in Latin America" (Martz).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.43" HREF="#FN1.43">43</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The "stable democracy" does exist, but as what Jenny Pearce calls "democracy without the people," the majority of whom are excluded from the political system monopolized by elites, more so as political space has been "rapidly closing by the mid-1980s." For Colombian elites, the international funding agencies, and foreign investors, "democracy" functions. But it is not intended for the public generally, who are "marginalized economically and politically." "The state has reserved for the majority the `state of siege' and all the exceptional repressive legislation and procedures that can guarantee order where other mechanisms fail," Pearce continues, increasingly in recent years. That is democracy, in exactly the sense of regular practice and even doctrine, if we attend closely.

<P>No discussion of "democracy enhancement" in the current era can fail to consider Haiti, a sickening story that requires separate treatment, particularly now, when Clinton Administration efforts to undermine Haitian democracy have reached such a sordid level that even his allies are deserting the ship. As of March, the latest revelation of Clintonite deceit on "restoring democracy" to Haiti was the Congressional testimony of Lawrence Pezzullo, the Secretary of State's special adviser for Haiti. Pezzullo was questioned about a plan "portrayed as a Haitian solution spawned by weeks of tough negotiations in Washington among disparate leaders of Haitian society," Christopher Marquis reported in the <CITE>Miami Herald.</CITE> The Clinton Administration had strongly supported the plan as the optimal solution, representing Haitian democrats. It harshly condemned Aristide for his intransigence in rejecting the plan -- which, true enough, ignored such minor matters as the return of the elected President to Haiti and the removal of the worst of the state terrorists from power. Pezzullo conceded that the plan had in fact been "spawned" in the offices of the State Department, which selected the "Haitian negotiators" who were to ratify it in Washington. Included among them were right-wing extremists with close military ties, notably Frantz-Robert Mond, a former member of Duvalier's terrorist Tontons Macoute and a close associate of police chief Lt.-Col. Joseph Michel Francois, the most brutal and powerful of the Haitian state terrorists (incidentally, another beneficiary of US training).

<P>"In other words, the operation was a hoax" (Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs), yet another effort to ensure that democracy is "enhanced" in Haiti in the familiar way -- without any "populist-based change" that might upset "established economic and political orders" and open "a leftist direction" (Carothers).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1.44" HREF="#FN1.44">44</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>I'll save until next time the Haitian illustration of the "romantic age" to which we have led suffering humanity.

<P>As discussed in Part I, the Reagan-Bush Administrations reluctantly adopted "prodemocracy policies as a means of relieving pressure for more radical change," and "inevitably sought only limited, top-down forms of democratic change that did not risk upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied" (Thomas Carothers of the Reagan State Department). The leading idea is revealed in the documents of USAID's democracy project, which stress that the U.S. supports "processes of democratic institutional reform that will further economic liberalization objectives" -- that is, entrenchment of the service role.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.1" HREF="#FN2.1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The reference to "the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied" has to undergo the usual translation. The phrase "United States" refers to the "traditional structures of power" at home. This is among the elementary truths that are to remain unspoken, along with the fact that the policies for the service areas merely adapt a conception of democracy that is to apply to the home societies as well. Here the general public "must be put in its place," as Walter Lippmann explained in his progressive essays on democracy long ago. The "ignorant and meddlesome outsiders" are to be only "interested spectators of action," not "participants." Their sole "function" in a democracy is to choose periodically among the leadership class (elections). Also unspoken is the fact that the "responsible men" who manage the democratic society gain that status by virtue of their service to "the traditional structures of power." There is a very broad consensus in the intellectual community, and of course the business world, that the "ignorant and incapable mass of humanity" must not be allowed to disrupt policy formation (Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of State Robert Lansing), that planners must be "insulated" from politics, in World Bank lingo.

<P>The "prodemocracy policies" in the service areas long antedate the Reaganites, and have little to do with the Cold War, apart from ideological cover. Accordingly, they should be expected to persist, as they do. Among the cases reviewed in Part I, the most striking is Colombia, which has become the leading human rights violator in the hemisphere and the recipient of more than half of total U.S. military aid and training, sent on its way with the usual acclaim for Colombia's democratic achievements as state terror mounts -- all rising to new heights under Clinton.

<P>"Human Rights enhancement" marches on in parallel. In Part I, I reviewed Clinton's steps to evade congressional efforts to impose human rights conditions on military aid and trade privileges for Indonesia and China, and the concept of "human rights" itself, crafted to evade atrocities that contribute to profit. In the weeks since, the China story took its predictable course. "President Clinton's decision to renew China's trade benefits was the culmination of a titanic clash between America's global economic interests and its self-image as the world's leading advocate of human rights," Thomas Friedman's lead article opened in the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> reporting the surprising outcome. Clinton did not merely endorse the Bush Administration policies that he had caustically denounced during the presidential campaign, but went well beyond them, deciding "to delink human rights" completely from trade privileges.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.2" HREF="#FN2.2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Indonesia case sheds further light on the "titanic clash." As discussed in Part I, Clinton joined his predecessors and colleagues abroad in ensuring the welfare of the Indonesian tyrants and murderers and the foreign corporations that benefit from their rule, blocking and evading congressional restrictions on military assistance. The issue was quite narrow: whether to refrain from direct participation in Indonesian atrocities at home and abroad. There was no thought of proceeding beyond, to some action to deter some of the worst crimes of the modern era.

<P>The review in Part I was perhaps unfair in not mentioning that world leaders do recognize some limits, and have indeed considered sanctions against Indonesia. In November 1993, on behalf of the nonaligned movement and the World Health Organization (WHO), Indonesia submitted to the UN a resolution requesting an opinion from the World Court on the legality of the use of nuclear weapons. In the face of this atrocity, the guardians of international morality leaped into action. The U.S., U.K., and France threatened Indonesia with trade sanctions and termination of aid unless it withdrew the resolution, as it did. Traditional clients understand very well when a message from the powerful is to be heeded.

<P>Citizens of the free world were again fortunate to have the information readily available to them; in this case, in the Catholic Church press in Canada.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.3" HREF="#FN2.3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Freedom of information can go only so far, however. On June 10, the World Court was scheduled to take up the WHO request for an opinion, despite a furious campaign by the U.S., U.K., and their allies to prevent this outrage. The matter is of some importance. Even consideration of the issue by the Court would be a contribution to the cause of nonproliferation; even more so a decision that use of nuclear weapons is a crime under international law -- hence by implication, possession as well. As of mid-June, I have found no word on the matter, though the nonproliferation treaty is a topic of lead headlines, particularly the threat posed to its renewal in 1995 by North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program.

<P>I barely mentioned one of the clearest tests of the Clinton vision on "democracy enhancement": Haiti. The case serves well to illustrate the "prodemocracy policies" of the Reagan-Bush years, as Carothers accurately describes them. We may ask, then, how things changed as the New Democrats took command.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.4" HREF="#FN2.4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<H3>1. The Legacy of History</H3>

<P>Even the briefest glimpse of Haiti's torment leaves impressions that do not easily fade, beginning with the scene of desolation on approaching the international airport. It is hard to remember that through the 18th century the island was the richest and most profitable of the Western colonies, and like today's Bangladesh, had struck the European conquerors as a virtual paradise. The Presidential Palace in Port-au-Prince, dominating a large square, is flanked by the headquarters of the military command and, at a slight remove, the equally-dreaded police. The symbols of authority and violence stand in impudent mockery of the misery that lies below them -- "confirming the permanence of power, a reminder to the people of their smallness in regard to the state, a reminder to the executioners of the omnipotence of their chief," in the worlds of Haitian anthropologist Michel-Rolph Trouillot, expressing the logic of the Duvalierists, Papa Doc and Baby Doc, who ruled with brutal violence for 30 years.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.5" HREF="#FN2.5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the markets and slums below, it is barely possible to make one's way down alleys of mud and filth through teeming masses of people clad in rags. Women struggle past with huge burdens on their heads, children try to sell any miserable object, an occasional cart is dragged through mud that is inches deep and puddles left by recent rains. Flies swarm over a handful of vegetables and what might pass for fish. Peasants who have trudged down from the mountains on ancient trails sit by their paltry offerings, sleeping in the relics of shacks that line the alleys. In the depths of Third World poverty, one rarely finds a scene so noxious and depressing.

<P>When I visited briefly a year ago, before the renewed terror, some people in the marketplace were willing to speak in the presence of a translator who was known and trusted, but only in circumlocution. The eyes of the security forces are everywhere, they intimated by their gestures more than their words. These were uniform: hunger, no work, no hope -- unless, somehow, President Aristide returns, though few dare to articulate the phrase beyond hints and nods. Some do, with remarkable courage, even after police torture and the threat of worse. It is not easy to believe that such courage can long survive, even if the people do.

<P>U.S. relations with Haiti are not a thing of yesterday, and show no sign of fundamental change. They go back 200 years, to the days when the Republic that had just won its independence from Britain joined the imperial powers in their campaign to quell Haiti's slave rebellion by violence. When the rebellion nevertheless succeeded, the U.S. exceeded all others in the harshness of its reaction, refusing to recognize Haiti until 1862, in the context of the American civil war. At that moment, Haiti was important for its strategic location and as a possible dumping ground for freed slaves; Liberia was recognized in the same year, for the same reasons. Haiti then became a plaything for U.S.-European power politics, with numerous U.S. interventions culminating in Woodrow Wilson's invasion of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where his warriors -- as viciously racist as the Administration in Washington -- murdered and destroyed, reinstituted virtual slavery, dismantled the constitutional system because the backward Haitians could not see the merits of turning their country into a U.S. plantation, and established the National Guards that held both countries in their grip after the Marines finally left.

<P>Wilson's thuggery has entered history in two different versions: here and there. In the U.S., the events figure in the amusing reconstructions entitled "history" as an illustration of U.S. "humanitarian intervention" and its difficulties (for us). Haitians have somewhat different memories. "Most observers agree that the achievements of the occupation were minor; they disagree only as to the amount of damage it inflicted," Trouillot writes under the heading "unhealed sores." The damage included the acceleration of Haiti's economic, military, and political centralization, its economic dependence and sharp class divisions, the vicious exploitation of the peasantry, the internal racial conflicts much intensified by the extreme racism of the occupying forces, and perhaps worst of all, the establishment of "an army to fight the people." "The 1915-1934 U.S. occupation of Haiti," he writes, "left the country with two poisoned gifts: a weaker civil society and a solidified state apparatus.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.6" HREF="#FN2.6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A year ago, after enduring almost two years of renewed state violence, grassroots organizations, priests in hiding, tortured labor leaders, and others suffering bitterly from the violence of the security forces expressed marked opposition to the plan to dispatch 500 UN police to the terrorized country, seeing them as a cover for a U.S. intervention that evokes bitter memories of the Marine occupation. If ever noted, such reactions may be attributed to the fact that "even a benevolent occupation creates resistance...among the beneficiaries" (Harvard historian David Landes, writing about the Marine occupation). Or to the deficiencies of people who need only a new culture and more kind tutelage of the kind he provided as director of the USAID mission in 1977-79, Lawrence Harrison writes in a "think piece" on Haiti's problems in which the U.S. military occupation merits only the words: "And some of the Marines abused their power."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.7" HREF="#FN2.7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Poor and suffering people do not have the luxury of indulging in fairy tales. Not uncommonly, their own experience gives them a grasp of realities that are well concealed by the intellectual culture. The usual victims can not so easily dismiss the record of U.S. power, which leaves little doubt that U.S. military intervention in Haiti would be the death knell for any form of democracy that "risks upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied." Haitians who have lost all hope for restoration of democracy might support a military intervention that could, perhaps, reduce terror and torture. But that is the most that can be realistically expected.

<P>The military occupation left the island under U.S. control and largely U.S.-owned. The killer and torturer Trujillo took over the Dominican Republic, remaining a great friend until he began to get out of hand in the 1950s. In Haiti, Washington reacted with some ambivalence to the murderous and brutal dictatorship of "Papa Doc" Francois Duvalier, finding him a bit too independent for its taste. Nevertheless, Kennedy provided him with military assistance, in line with his general program of establishing firm U.S. control over the hemisphere's military and police as they undertook the task of "internal security" that he assigned them in a historic 1962 decision. Kennedy also provided aid for the Francois Duvalier International Airport in exchange for the Haitian vote to expel Cuba from the OAS. When "Baby Doc" Jean-Claude took over in 1971, relations rapidly improved, and Haiti became another "darling" of the business community, along with Brazil under the neo-Nazi generals and other right-thinking folk. USAID undertook to turn Haiti into the "Taiwan of the Caribbean," forecasting "a historic change toward deeper market interdependence with the United States," Trouillot observes. U.S. taxpayers funded projects to establish assembly plants that would exploit such advantages as enormous unemployment (thanks in part to USAID policies emphasizing agroexport) and a workforce -- mainly women, as elsewhere considered more docile -- with wages of 14 cents an hour, no unions, ample terror, and the other usual amenities. The consequences were profits for U.S. corporations and their Haitian associates, and a decline of 56% in wages in the 1980s. In short, if not Taiwan exactly, Haiti was an "economic miracle" of the usual sort.

<P>Haiti offered the Reaganites yet another opportunity to reveal their understanding of democracy enhancement in June 1985, when its legislature unanimously adopted a new law requiring that every political party must recognize President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier as the supreme arbiter of the nation, outlawing the Christian Democrats, and granting the government the right to suspend the rights of any party without reasons. The law was ratified by a majority of 99.98%. Washington was deeply impressed, as much so as it was when Mussolini won 99% of the vote in the March 1934 election, leading Roosevelt's State Department to conclude that the results "demonstrate incontestably the popularity of the Fascist regime" and of "that admirable Italian gentleman" who ran it, as Roosevelt described the dictator. These are among the many interesting facts that might be recalled as neo-Fascists now take their place openly in the political system that was reconstructed with their interests in mind as Italy was liberated by American forces 50 years ago. Curiously, all this escaped attention during the D-Day anniversary extravaganza, along with much else that is too enlightening.

<P>The 1985 steps to enhance democracy in Haiti were "an encouraging step forward," the U.S. Ambassador informed his guests at a July 4 celebration. The Reagan Administration certified to Congress that "democratic development" was progressing, so that military and economic aid could continue to flow -- mainly into the pockets of Baby Doc and his entourage. It also informed Congress that the human rights situation was improving, as it was at the time in El Salvador and Guatemala, and today in Colombia, and quite generally when some client regime requires military aid for "internal security." The House Foreign Affairs Committee, controlled by Democrats, had given its approval in advance, calling on Reagan "to maintain friendly relations with Duvalier's non-Communist government."

<P>To justify their perception of an "encouraging step forward" in "democratic development," the Reaganites could have recalled the vote held under Woodrow Wilson's rule after he had disbanded the Haitian parliament in punishment for its refusal to turn Haiti over to American corporations under a new U.S.-designed Constitution. Wilson's Marines organized a plebiscite in which the Constitution was ratified by a 99.9% vote, with 5% of the population participating, using "rather high handed methods to get the Constitution adopted by the people of Haiti," the State Department conceded a decade later. Baby Doc, in contrast, allowed a much broader franchise, though it is true that he demanded a slightly higher degree of acquiescence than Wilsonian idealists, Mussolini, and New Dealers. A case could be made, then, that the lessons in democracy that Washington had been laboring to impart were finally sinking in.

<P>These gratifying developments were short-lived, however. By December 1985, popular protests were straining the resources of state terror. What happened next was described by the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> with engaging frankness: after "huge demonstrations," the White House concluded "that the regime was unraveling" and that "Haiti's ruling inner circle had lost faith in" its favored democrat, Baby Doc. "As a result, U.S. officials, including Secretary of State George Shultz, began openly calling for a `democratic process' in Haiti." Small wonder that Shultz is so praised for his commitment to democracy and other noble traits.

<P>The meaning of this call for democracy was underscored by the scenario then unfolding in the Philippines, where the army and elite made it clear they would no longer support another gangster for whom Reagan and Bush had expressed their admiration, even "love," not long before, so that the White House "began openly calling for a `democratic process'" there as well. Both events accordingly enter the canon as a demonstration of how we "served as inspiration for the triumph of democracy in our time" in those wondrous years (<CITE>New Republic</CITE>).

<P>Washington lent its support to the post-Duvalier National Council of Government (CNG), providing $2.8 million in military aid in its first year, while the CNG, "generously helped by the U.S. taxpayer's money, had openly gunned down more civilians than Jean-Claude Duvalier's government had done in fifteen years" (Trouillot). After a series of coups and massacres, Reagan's Ambassador explained to Human Rights investigators that "I don't see any evidence of a policy against human rights"; there may be violence, it is true, but it is just "part of the culture." We can only watch in dismay and incomprehension.

<P>Haitian violence thus falls into the same category as the atrocities in El Salvador at the same time, for example, the massacre at El Mozote, one of the many conducted by U.S.-trained elite battalions -- and one of the few to be admitted to History, after exposure by the UN Truth Commission. Given their origins in U.S. planning, these routine atrocities must also be "part of the culture." Or perhaps "There is no one to blame except the gods of war," as Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> observed, reviewing the "fair-minded" account by Mark Danner which "aptly denotes" the "horrifying incident" as "a central parable of the cold war" for which blame is shared equally by Salvadorans on all sides, murderers and victims alike. In contrast, atrocities organized and directed by the Soviet Union always seemed to have more determinable origins, for some reason.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.8" HREF="#FN2.8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<H3>2. The Democratic Interlude</H3>

<P>Haiti's happy ascent towards Taiwan was deflected unexpectedly in December 1990, when a real problem arose, unlike the terror and virtual enslavement of workers that are just "part of the culture." Washington made a serious error, allowing a free election in expectation of an easy victory for its candidate, Marc Bazin, a former World Bank official. To the surprise of outside observers, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected with two-thirds of the vote (Bazin was second with 14%), backed by a popular movement, Lavalas, which had escaped the notice of the rich folk. Outside of properly educated circles, one question came to the fore at once: What would the U.S. and its clients do to remove this cancer?

<P>President Aristide held office from February to September, when his government was overthrown by a military coup, plunging the country into even deeper barbarism than before. There are two versions of what happened in the interim. One is given by various extremists who see Aristide as the representative of a "remarkably advanced" array of grass-roots organizations (Lavalas) that gave the large majority of the population a "considerable voice in local affairs" and even in national politics (Americas Watch); and who were impressed by Aristide's domestic policies as he "acted quickly to restore order to the government's finances" after taking power when "the economy was in an unprecedented state of disintegration" (Inter-American Development Bank). Other international lending agencies agreed, offering aid and endorsing Aristide's investment program. They were particularly impressed by the steps he took to reduce foreign debt and inflation, to raise foreign exchange reserves from near zero to $12 million, to increase government revenues with successful tax collection measures (reaching into the kleptocracy), to streamline the bloated government bureaucracy and eliminate fictitious positions in an anti-corruption campaign, to cut back contraband trade and improve customs, and to establish a responsible fiscal system.

<P>These actions were "welcomed by the international financial community," the IADB noted, leading to "a substantial increase in assistance." Atrocities and flight of refugees also virtually ended; indeed the refugee flow reversed, as Haitians began to return to their country in its moment of hope. The U.S. Embassy in Haiti secretly acknowledged the facts. In a February 1991 State Department cable, declassified in 1994, the number two person in the Embassy, Vicky Huddleston, reported to Washington on "the surprisingly successful efforts of the Aristide government,...quickly reversed after the coup" (reported by Dennis Bernstein for Pacific News Service).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.9" HREF="#FN2.9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Sophisticates in Washington and New York could understand that all of this is illusion. As Secretary of State Lansing had explained: "The experience of Liberia and Haiti show that the African race are devoid of any capacity for political organization and lack genius for government. Unquestionably there is an inherent tendency to revert to savagery and to cast aside the shackles of civilization which are irksome to their physical nature. Of course, there are many exceptions to this racial weakness, but it is true of the mass, as we know from experience in this country. It is that which makes the negro problem practically unsolvable."

<P>A more acceptable version of Aristide's months in offices is offered by <CITE>New York Times</CITE> Haiti correspondent Howard French. He reported after the coup that Aristide had governed "with the aid of fear," leaning "heavily on Lavalas, an unstructured movement of affluent idealists and long-exiled leftists" whose model was China's Cultural Revolution. Aristide's power hunger led to "troubles with civil society." Furthermore, "Haitian political leaders and diplomats say, the growing climate of vigilantism as well as increasingly strident statements by Father Aristide blaming the wealthier classes for the poverty of the masses encouraged" the coup. "Although he retains much of the popular support that enabled him to win 67% of the popular vote in the country's December 1990 elections, Father Aristide was overthrown in part because of concerns among politically active people over his commitment to the Constitution, and growing fears of political and class-based violence, which many believe the President endorsed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.10" HREF="#FN2.10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Relation to fact aside, the analysis provides some lessons in Political Correctness. Two-thirds of the population and their organizations fall outside of "civil society." Those involved in the popular organizations and in local and national politics are not among the "politically active people." It is scandalous to tell the plain truth about the responsibility of the kleptocracy for "the poverty of the masses." "Fears of political and class-based violence" are limited to the months when such violence sharply declined, its traditional perpetrators being unable, temporarily, to pursue their vocation.

<P>These lessons should be remembered as Washington moves to construct a "civil society" and "democratic political order" for this "failed state" with its degenerate culture and people, quite incapable of governing themselves.

<P>In reality, the two versions of what happened during the democratic interlude are closer than it may seem on the surface. The "remarkably advanced" array of popular organizations that brought the large majority of the population into the political arena is precisely what frightened Washington and the mainstream generally. They have a different understanding of "democracy" and "civil society," one that offers no place to popular organizations that allow the overwhelming majority a voice in managing their own affairs. By definition, the "political leaders" of such popular organizations have only "meager" democratic credentials, and can therefore be granted only symbolic participation in the "democratic institutions" that we will construct in accord with our traditional "prodemocracy policies." So the government and media have been instructing us since the coup removed the radical extremist Aristide and his Maoist clique.

<P>These simple truths account for much of what has happened in Haiti since Aristide's election. Trouillot concludes his study by observing that "In Haiti, the peasantry is the nation." But for policymakers, the peasantry are worthless objects except insofar as they can advance corporate profits. They may produce food for export and enrich local affiliates of U.S. agribusiness, or flock to the city to provide super-cheap labor for assembly plants, but they have no further function. It is therefore entirely natural that USAID, while providing $100 million in assistance to the private sector, should never have provided a penny to the leading popular peasant organization, the Peasant Movement of Papaye (MPP); and that former USAID director Harrison should see no special problem when MPP members are massacred by the military forces and should dismiss with contempt its call for moves to reinstitute the popularly elected President who was committed to "bottom-up" rather than "top-down" democracy.

<P>Similarly, it is hardly surprising that USAID should have denounced the labor reforms Aristide sought to institute and opposed his efforts to raise the minimum wage to a princely 37 cents an hour. Nor should we find it odd that USAID invested massively in the low wage assembly sector while wages sharply declined and working conditions fell to abysmal levels, but terminated all efforts to promote investment as the democratically elected government took office. Rather, USAID reacted to this catastrophe by dedicating itself still more firmly to providing the Haitian business community with what it called "technical assistance in labor relations, development of a business oriented public relations campaign, and intensified efforts to attract U.S. products assembly operations to Haiti." Given the unfortunate democratic deviation, USAID's task, in its own words, was to "work to develop sustainable dialogue between the government and the business community"; no comparable efforts for workers and peasants were needed when Haiti was run by U.S.-backed killers and torturers. All of this conforms well to USAID's conception of "processes of democratic institutional reform" as those that "further economic liberalization objectives.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.11" HREF="#FN2.11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Similarly, there is no reason to be surprised that U.S. elites suddenly began to show a sensitive concern for human rights and democracy just as human rights violations precipitously declined and democracy (though not in the preferred "top-down" sense) began to flourish. Amy Wilentz observes that during Aristide's brief term, Washington suddenly became concerned with "human rights and the rule of law in Haiti." "During the four regimes that preceded Aristide," she writes, "international human-rights advocates and democratic observers had begged the State Department to consider helping the democratic opposition in Haiti. But no steps were taken by the United States to strengthen anything but the executive and the military until Aristide won the presidency. Then, all of a sudden, the United States began to think about how it could help those Haitians eager to limit the powers of the executive or to replace the government constitutionally." The State Department "Democracy Enhancement" project was "specifically designed to fund those sectors of the Haitian political spectrum where opposition to the Aristide government could be encouraged," precisely as "prodemocracy policies" dictate. The institutions and leaders that merited such support are just the ones that survived the military coup, also no surprise.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.12" HREF="#FN2.12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<H3>3. After the Coup</H3>

<P>Wilentz reports further that immediately after the September 30 coup, the State Department apparently "circulated a thick notebook filled with alleged human rights violations" under Aristide -- "something it had not done under the previous rulers, Duvalierists and military men," who were deemed proper recipients for aid, including military aid, "based on unsubstantiated human-rights improvements." <CITE>Toronto Star</CITE> reporter Linda Diebel adds details. A "thick, bound dossier" on Aristide's alleged crimes was presented by the coup leader, General Cedras, to OAS negotiators. On October 3, U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams summoned reporters from the <CITE>New York Times, Washington Post,</CITE> and other major U.S. journals to private meetings where he briefed them on these alleged crimes, reportedly presenting them with the "dossier" -- which, we may learn some day, was compiled by U.S. intelligence and provided to its favorite generals. The Ambassador and his helpers began leaking the tales that have been used since to demonstrate Aristide's meager democratic credentials and his psychological disorders.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.13" HREF="#FN2.13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The approved version is reflected by coverage of human rights abuses after the coup. As shown in a study by Boston Media Action, while the military were rampaging, the press focussed on abuses attributed to Aristide supporters, less than 1% of the total but the topic of 60% of the coverage in major journals during the two weeks following the coup, and over half of coverage in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> through mid-1992. During the two-week period after the coup, Catherine Orenstein reports, the <CITE>Times</CITE> "spent over three times as many column inches discussing Aristide's alleged transgressions [as] it spent reporting on the ongoing military repression. Mass murders, executions, and tortures that were reported in human rights publications earned less than 4% of the space that the <CITE>Times</CITE> devoted to Haiti in those weeks." A week after the coup, the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> accused Aristide of having organized his followers into "an instrument of real terror," ignoring the 75% reduction in human rights abuses during his term reported by human rights groups.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.14" HREF="#FN2.14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>While attention was directed to the really important topic of the "class-based violence" of Aristide and the popular movements, the U.S.-trained military and police were conducting their reign of terror, "ruthlessly suppressing Haiti's once diverse and vibrant civil society," Americas Watch reported. Though "Washington's capacity to curb attacks on civil society was tremendous, this power was largely unexercised by the Bush administration," which "sought to convey an image of normalcy" while forcefully returning refugees. The terror is functional: it ensures that even if Aristide is permitted to return, "he would have difficulty transforming his personal popularity into the organized support needed to exert civilian authority," Americas Watch observed in early 1993, quoting priests and others who feared that the destruction of the popular social organizations that "gave people hope" had already undermined the great promise of Haiti's first democratic experiment.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.15" HREF="#FN2.15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The coup and ensuing terror revived the flow of refugees that had lapsed under Aristide. The Bush Administration ordered the Coast Guard and Navy to force them back, or to imprison them in the U.S. military base in Guantanamo until a court order terminated the shocking practices there. During the presidential campaign, Clinton bitterly condemned these cruel policies. On taking over in January 1993, he at once tightened the noose, imposing a still harsher blockade. Forceful return of refugees continued in violation of international law and human rights conventions. Clinton's increased brutality proved to be a grand success. Refugee flow, which had reached over 30,000 in 1992, sharply declined under Clinton's ministrations, to about the level of 1989, before the sharp decline under Aristide.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.16" HREF="#FN2.16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The official story is that these are "economic refugees," not victims of political persecution who would be eligible for asylum. The onset of poverty can be quite precisely dated: to the date of the coup. During Aristide's term, refugee flow was slight, skyrocketing after the coup though economic sanctions were minimal. These oddities are noted by the indispensable journal <CITE>Haiti Info</CITE> published in Port-au-Prince, in a discussion of a cable circulated to high officials by U.S. Ambassador William Swing. The 11-page cable, full of racist slanders, alleges that "the Haitian left manipulates and fabricates human rights abuses as a propaganda tool" and is "wittingly or unwittingly assisted in this effort" by human rights organizations and the civilian monitors of the UN and OAS missions; all "comsymps" in the terminology of an earlier day. The Embassy dismissed with a sneer the reports of "the sudden epidemic of rapes" on the grounds that "For a range of cultural reasons (not pleasant to contemplate), rape has never been considered or reported as a serious crime here." The testimony of a man that his wife was raped and that he was badly beaten under police custody, corroborated by a foreign nurse, is dismissed because he chose asylum in Canada (granted at once), avoiding the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) -- a transparent admission of iniquity. Clinton's Embassy attributes problems in Haiti to "a high level of structural, or endemic, violence," which, again, is just "part of the culture." Like the poverty that causes refugee flight, the "structural" factors causing violence had an unexplained 8-month gap: during Aristide's tenure even his most vehement opponents, the USAID-supported "human rights" advocates who moved quickly into power after the coup, could compile only 25 cases of "mob violence" and four crimes that could be considered political, a tiny fraction of the terror before, not to speak of the atrocities that followed the coup.

<P>Kenneth Roth, the director of Human Rights Watch, comments that the cable reveals the "extreme antipathy for Aristide" in the Embassy and its "willingness to play down human rights abuses to prevent a political momentum to build for [Aristide's] return." It "reflects a dislike and distrust of Aristide that has been widely felt in the Administration -- though voiced only privately," <CITE>Times</CITE> correspondent Elaine Sciolino adds. In reality, the dislike is quite public and widely reported, along with the fact that it has sent a very clear message to the Haitian rulers, military and civilian.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.17" HREF="#FN2.17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As the Embassy cable was released, an experienced INS asylum officer in Haiti went public with his charges that thousands of "egregious cases of persecution" were rejected by the Haitian INS office, where the "entire process" of asylum review "had been politicized" and under 1% of legitimate petitions were accepted by racist and contemptuous officials; similar accounts have been documented by human rights organizations, who have also denounced the very idea that petitioners should have to identify themselves to the murderers by appearing at the INS office. At the same time, a "Top Secret" memo of the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba was leaked. Addressed to the Secretary of State, the CIA, and the INS, the document complains about the lack of genuine claims of political persecution in Cuba, contrary to policy needs. The usual silence prevailed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.18" HREF="#FN2.18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Meanwhile refugees from Cuba receive royal treatment while Haitians are returned to terror. That is nothing new. Of the more than 24,000 Haitians intercepted by U.S. forces from 1981 to Aristide's takeover in 1991, 11 were granted asylum as victims of political persecution, in comparison with 75,000 out of 75,000 Cubans. In these years of terror, Washington allowed 28 asylum claims. During Aristide's tenure, with violence and repression radically reduced, 20 were allowed from a refugee pool perhaps 1/50th the scale. Practice returned to normal after the military coup and the renewed terror. As always, human rights are understood in purely instrumental terms: as a weapon to be selectively deployed for power interests, nothing more.

<P>The democratically elected President will be acceptable to Washington and elite opinion generally only if he abandons his popular mandate, ceding effective power to the "moderates" in the business world. The "moderates" are those who do not favor slaughter and mutilation, preferring to see the population driven to agroexport and the low-wage assembly sector. They constitute "civil society," in the technical sense. Since the coup, the U.S. has demanded that Aristide agree to "broaden the government" in such a way as to place the "moderates" in power. Insofar as he refuses to transfer power into these proper hands, he is an "extremist" whom we can hardly support.

<P>While these are the basic terms of respectable discourse, the spectrum is not entirely uniform. It ranges from the far right, which is honest and outspoken in its call for dismantling Haitian democracy, to the more nuanced versions of the liberal Democrats. Taking a stand in the middle, George Bush calls for abandoning Aristide because "he has become unreliable" and even "turned on our president the other day" (May 1994). Aristide should be dumped because his "undemocratic behavior...included fostering violence against his opponents," according to another noted pacifist who has distinguished himself particularly for his dedication to legality and democratic principle (Elliott Abrams).

<P>Moving toward the liberal end, a Clinton official explained in the last days of 1993 that "We're not talking about dumping Aristide or about military power-sharing. But we have two adversaries who don't want to compromise and we have to find enough of a middle to make a functioning democracy," marginalizing the extremists on both sides. The elected President should be "restored to power, at least nominally," World Peace Foundation president and historian Robert Rotberg added; but also at most nominally, as all understand. The Washington director of the Inter-American Dialogue, Peter Hakim, urged in May 1994 that "the US ought to separate out the notion of protecting human rights, and reestablishing some semblance of society in Haiti, from restoring Aristide to power." "So it is only honest for the United States to tell Father Aristide that he has little hope of returning to power without making large political compromises," as the <CITE>Times</CITE> editors phrased the common understanding a few weeks later. In short, the traditional "prodemocracy policies."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.19" HREF="#FN2.19">19</A></FONT></SUP>
 
The basic idea was outlined by Secretary of State Warren Christopher during his confirmation hearings. Christopher "expressed support for Father Aristide," Elaine Sciolino reported, "but stopped short of calling for his reinstatement as President. `There is no question in my mind that because of the election, he has to be part of the solution to this,' Mr. Christopher said. `I don't have a precise system worked out in my mind as to how he would be part of the solution, but certainly he cannot be ignored in the matter'.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.20" HREF="#FN2.20">20</A></FONT></SUP>
 With this ringing endorsement of democracy, the Clinton Administration took charge.

<P>Across the spectrum, it is taken for granted that we have both the right and the competence to "establish some semblance of society" in Haiti, whose people are so retrograde as to have developed a "remarkably advanced" array of grass-roots organizations that gave the majority of the population a place in the public arena. Plainly, they desperately need our tutelage.

<H3>4. The Clinton Compromise</H3>

<P>To much acclaim, Washington finally succeeded in compelling Aristide to transfer authority to the "moderates." Under severe pressure, in July 1993 the Haitian President accepted the U.S.-UN terms for settlement, which were to allow him to return four months later in a "compromise" with the gangsters and killers. He agreed to appoint as Prime Minister a businessman from the traditional mulatto elite, Robert Malval, who is "known to be opposed to the populist policies during Aristide's seven months in power," the press announced with relief, noting that he is "generally well regarded by the business community," "respected by many businessmen who supported the coup that ousted the President," and seen as "a reassuring choice" by coup-supporters.

<P>Shortly after these happy developments took place, UN/OAS observers reported, with little notice, that they were "very concerned that there is no perceptible lessening of human rights violations," and a few weeks later, reported an increase in "arbitrary executions and suspicious deaths" in the weeks following the UN-brokered accord, over one a day in the Port-au-Prince area alone; "the mission said that many of the victims were members of popular organizations and neighborhood associations and that some of the killers were police," wire services reported.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.21" HREF="#FN2.21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Expected to be a transitional figure, Malval resigned at the year's end. His presence did, however, serve a useful role for Washington and its media, diverting attention to a "political settlement" while attacks on the popular organizations and general terror mounted, Aristide's promised return was blocked, and new initiatives were put forth to transfer power to traditional power centers ("broadening the government"). Malval's presence also offered the press a great method to bring out Aristide's unreasonable intransigence. He couldn't even come to terms with "his handpicked Prime Minister," a phrase that ritually accompanied the name "Robert Malval." In a typical exercise, Howard French opened a report of Malval's resignation by writing: "Three days after formally resigning, the handpicked Prime Minister of Haiti's exiled President lashed out this weekend at the man who appointed him" -- hammering home the message in the fashion that became so routine as to be comical. Malval described Aristide as an "erratic figure" with a "serious ego problem," French continued, referring to his commitment to restore the democratically-elected government.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.22" HREF="#FN2.22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As the date for Aristide's scheduled October 30 return approached, atrocities mounted high enough to gain some attention, though no action. Amidst reports of "terrifying stories" of terror, murder, and threats to exterminate all members of the popular organizations, the Clinton Administration announced that the UN Mission "will rely on the Haitian military and police to maintain order" -- that is, on the killers. "It is not a peacekeeping role," Secretary of Defense Aspin explained: "We are doing something other than peacekeeping here." Meanwhile, the press emphasized the concerns of U.S. officials that Aristide "isn't moving strongly to restore democratic rights," from his exile in Washington. "Even as the situation has grown worse, foreign diplomats have increasingly blamed Father Aristide for what they say is his failure to take constructive initiatives," Howard French wrote, using the standard device to disguise propaganda as reporting.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.23" HREF="#FN2.23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The stage was set for ignoring the October deadline, as the U.S. stood helplessly by, unable to bring the uncompromising and violent extremists on both sides to accept "democracy."

<P>Reviewing these mid-1993 developments, Ian Martin, who directed the OAS/UN mission from April through December 1993, writes that one basic problem was U.S. insistence on adding "a mostly American military component to the negotiators' proposals." Aristide's call for reducing the Haitian army to 1000 men was rejected. "The Haitian high command, for its part, sought U.S. assistance to ensure the army's future." The generals trusted the U.S. and "mistrusted the U.N. and the proposal for the Canadians and French, both more committed supporters of Aristide than the United States, to take the lead in the police contingent. The U.S. hoped to preserve the military -- an institution it had often assisted and in fact had created for purposes of internal control during the American occupation of 1915-34." Haitian army "resistance was encouraged whenever they perceived that the United States, despite its rhetoric of democracy, was ambivalent about that power shift" to the popular elements represented by Aristide. There was no shortage of such occasions.

<P>The crucial signal, Martin and others agree, came on October 11, when the USS <CITE>Harlan County</CITE> was scheduled to disembark U.S. and Canadian troops at Port-au-Prince. The military organized "a hostile demonstration of armed thugs," Martin observes, and "instead of waiting in the harbor while the Haitian military was pressured to ensure a safe landing, the <CITE>Harlan County</CITE> turned tail for Guantanamo Bay," leaving officials of the UN/OAS mission "aghast"; they "had been neither consulted nor informed of the decision by President Bill Clinton's National Security Council to retreat." "The organizers of the Haitian protest could hardly believe their success," Martin continues. The leader of the paramilitary organization FRAPH, responsible for much of the terror, said that "My people kept wanting to run away, but I took the gamble and urged them to stay. Then the Americans pulled out! We were astonished. That was the day FRAPH was actually born. Before, everyone said we were crazy, suicidal, that we would all be burned if Aristide returned. But now we know he is never going to return." The military got the message too, loud and clear.

<P>Perhaps they were even notified in advance. <CITE>New York Daily News</CITE> correspondent Juan Gonzalez learned of the October 11 port demonstration the day before at a Duvalierist meeting attended by U.S. Embassy personnel. The following day, he asked in print: "How can two <CITE>Daily News</CITE> reporters who have only visited Haiti on a few occasions learn beforehand of secret plans to sabotage the landing of our troops, while our vaunted officialdom claims it was caught flat-footed?" How indeed.

<P>Another possible line of communication is suggested in a report by Father Antoine Adrien, former head of Aristide's religious order in Haiti and a close associate. Just before the ship "turned tail," he informed the Catholic Church press that Haitian military officers had not only attended training school in Fort Benning, Ga., in 1992, but that "some were there as recently as the previous week" -- October 1993. "How are you going to tell those people they have no backing in the United States?," Father Adrien asked. That Haitian army officers received training in the U.S. after the coup was confirmed in an internal Pentagon document, including eight officers who started courses in early 1992. The program they joined is designed to expose "future leaders of foreign defense establishments" to "American values, regard for human rights and democratic institutions," according to the Defense Secretary's report to the President for 1993. Earlier graduates include the leading killers in Haiti, Central America, and elsewhere.

<P>What lay behind the decision to turn tail was explained by Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Walter Slocombe, who "boasted at a cocktail party that by turning back the U.S.S. Harlan County, he had helped save the United States from a `small war'," the <CITE>Times</CITE> reported six months later: "He vowed that the Pentagon would not risk American soldiers' lives to put `that psychopath' back in power."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.24" HREF="#FN2.24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>While messages were coming through to the military, the Haitian people were deprived of the one voice they longed to hear. "Senior Clinton administration officials are embroiled in a fight over whether to allow...Aristide to broadcast into the junta-ruled country using airborne U.S. military transmitters," Paul Quinn-Judge reported in May 1994. The USIA is opposed, fearing that "the plan may violate international law," always a prime concern in Washington. USIA was also concerned that such broadcasts "would provide Aristide with an uncomfortably direct means to communicate with Haitians, who elected him by an overwhelming margin in 1990." His oratory has been known to "create problems," a classifed USIA memorandum of May 23 noted, asking whether "we wish to have the responsibility for having given him the means to broadcast whatever he chooses to Haiti." He might even challenge the U.S. publicly "the first time we refuse to air something." It wouldn't even suffice to have him submit his scripts in advance, because of the "highly nuanced language and context" of a radio broadcast; who knows what thoughts this devious creature might convey by his tone of voice? "Debate over the idea...underscores the continuing ambivalence and nervousness with which some senior officials view Aristide," Quinn-Judge observed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.25" HREF="#FN2.25">25</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>After the military coup, the OAS instituted a toothless embargo, which the Bush Administration reluctantly joined, while making clear that it was not to be taken seriously. The reasons were explained a year later by Howard French: "Washington's deep-seated ambivalence about a leftward-tilting nationalist whose style diplomats say has sometimes been disquietingly erratic" precludes any meaningful support for sanctions against the military rulers. "Despite much blood on the army's hands, United States diplomats consider it a vital counterweight to Father Aristide, whose class-struggle rhetoric...threatened or antagonized traditional power centers at home and abroad." Aristide's "call for punishment of the military leadership" that had slaughtered and tortured thousands of people "reinforced a view of him as an inflexible and vindictive crusader," and heightened Washington's "antipathy" towards the "clumsy" and "erratic" extremist who has aroused great "anger" because of "his tendency toward ingratitude."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.26" HREF="#FN2.26">26</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The "vital counterweight" is therefore to hold total power while the "leftward tilting nationalist" remains in exile, awaiting the "eventual return" that Bill Clinton promised on the eve of his inauguration. Meanwhile, the "traditional power centers" in Haiti and the U.S. will carry on with class struggle as usual, employing such terror as may be needed in order for plunder to proceed unhampered. And as the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> added at the same time, Washington was proving oddly ineffective in detecting the "lucrative use of the country in the transhipment of narcotics" by which "the military is funding its oil and other necessary imports," financing the necessary terror and rapacity -- though U.S. forces seem able to find every fishing boat carrying miserable refugees. Nor had Washington figured out a way to freeze the assets of "civil society" or to hinder their shopping trips to Miami and New York, or to induce its Dominican clients to monitor the border to impede the flow of goods that takes care of the wants of "civil society" while the embargo remains "at best, sieve-like."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.27" HREF="#FN2.27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Meanwhile Washington continued to provide Haitian military leaders with intelligence on narcotics trafficking -- which they naturally used to expedite their activities and tighten their grip on power. It is not easy to intercept narcotraffickers, the press explained, because "Haiti has no radar," and evidently the U.S. Navy and Air Force lack the means to remedy this deficiency.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.28" HREF="#FN2.28">28</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Under Clinton, matters only got worse. An April 1994 report of Human Rights Watch/Americas documents the increasing terror and State Department apologetics and evasions, condemning the Administration for having "embraced a murderous armed force as a counterweight to a populist president it distrusts."

<P>On February 4, 1992, the Bush Administration lifted the embargo for assembly plants, "under heavy pressure from American businesses with interests in Haiti," the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> reported, with its editorial endorsement; the lobbying effort was assisted by Elliott Abrams, Human Rights Watch noted. For January-October 1992, U.S. trade with Haiti came to $265 million, according to the Department of Commerce.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.29" HREF="#FN2.29">29</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As Clinton took over, the embargo became still more porous. The Dominican border was left wide open. Meanwhile, U.S. companies continued to be exempted from the embargo -- so as to ease its effects on the population, the Administration announced with a straight face; only exemptions for U.S. firms have this curious feature. There were many heartfelt laments about the suffering of poor Haitians under the embargo, but one had to turn to the underground press in Haiti, the alternative media here, or an occasional letter to learn that the major peasant organization (MPP), church coalitions, labor organizations, and the National Federation of Haitian Students continued to call for a real embargo.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.30" HREF="#FN2.30">30</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Curiously, some of those most distressed by the impact of the embargo on the Haitian poor were the most forceful advocates of a still harsher embargo on Cuba, notably liberal Democrat Robert Torricelli, author of the stepped-up embargo that the Bush Administration accepted under pressure from the Clintonites. Evidently, hunger causes no pain to Cuban children, another oddity that passed unnoticed, along with the U.S.-Haiti trade figures.

<P>Clinton's tinkering with the embargo also passed without comment here, though the facts are known, and occasionally even leak through, as in a tiny Feb. 13 Reuters dispatch in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reporting efforts of human rights advocates to convince the President to observe the embargo. "US imports from Haiti rose by more than half last year [1993]," the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> reported in London, "thanks in part to an exemption granted by the US Treasury for imports of goods assembled in Haiti from US parts." U.S. exports to Haiti also rose in 1993. Exports from Haiti to the United States included food (fruits and nuts, citrus fruit or melons) from the starving country, which increased by a factor of 35 from January-July 1992 to January-July 1993. The federal government was among the purchasers of the baseballs imported from Haiti (duty free), stitched by women who work 11 hour days with a half-hour break in unbearable heat without running water or a working toilet, for 10 cents an hour if they can meet the quota (few can), using toxic materials without protection so that the U.S. importer can advertise proudly that their softballs are "hand-dipped for maximum bonding." The manufacturers are the wealthy Haitian families who supported the coup and have gained new riches during the embargo, along with others profiting handsomely from the black market, such as the fuel supplier for the U.S. embassy. The "assembly zone" loophole, criticized by U.S. labor unions and at the UN Security Council by France and Canada in January, was extended by the Clinton Administration on April 25, 1994, four days after announcing that it would seek to tighten UN sanctions; the latter announcement was reported. On the same day, the U.S. Coast Guard returned 98 refugees to military authorities, 18 of them at once arrested.

<P>"The Clinton administration still formally declares its support for Mr Aristide, but scarcely disguises its wish for a leader more accommodating to the military," the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> reported, while "European diplomats in Washington are scathing in their comments on what they see as the US's abdication of leadership over Haiti."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.31" HREF="#FN2.31">31</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In his January 1994 testimony to Congress on "Threats to the U.S.
and Its Interests Abroad," the Director of the CIA predicted that Haiti "probably will be out of fuel and power very shortly." "Our intelligence efforts are focused on detecting attempts to circumvent the embargo and monitoring its impact," and "any indication of an imminent exodus." The "Threats to the U.S." were contained with the usual selectivity and skill. "Exodus" from the charnel house was effectively blocked, while the press reported an "oil boom" as "diplomats expressed amazement at the extent of the trafficking" organized by the Haitian and Dominican armies, and the former assured reporters that "The military is not concerned about fuel shortages; it has plenty.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.32" HREF="#FN2.32">32</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Clinton Administration has scarcely departed from the prescriptions outlined by the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> and <CITE>New York Times</CITE> as it came into office.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.33" HREF="#FN2.33">33</A></FONT></SUP> The preferred solution, John Goshko explained in the <CITE>Post,</CITE> would "delay indefinitely" the return to Haiti of the "radical priest with anti-American leanings" whose "strident populism led the Haitian armed forces to seize power," and would "allow Bazin or some other prime minister to govern in his place." Bazin was then prime minister under army rule, but was having problems, because although "well-known and well-regarded in the United States," unfortunately "the masses in Haiti consider him a front man for military and business interests." A replacement would therefore be needed to represent the interests of the moderates. In the <CITE>Times,</CITE> Howard French indicated the scale of the required delay: "In the past, diplomats have said the Haitian President could return only after a substantial interim period during which the country's economy was revived and all its institutions, from the army itself to the judiciary to health care and education, were stabilized." That should overcome the danger of Aristide's "personalist and electoralist politics." But unfortunately, the troublesome priest has been recalcitrant: "Father Aristide and many of his supporters have held out for a quick return," undermining the moderate course.

<P>As understood on all sides, the "delay" need not be too long. 
Aristide's term ends in 1996, and he is barred from running again. By then military terror should have sufficiently intimidated the population and demolished popular organizations so that "free elections" can be tolerated, as in the Central American terror states, without too much fear of any threat to "civil society" from the rabble.

<H3>5. The May 1994 Reversal</H3>

<P>Plans proceeded on course into early 1994. By then, the cynicism and brutality of U.S. policy had become too blatant for the usual cover-up, particularly after Clinton's point man Lawrence Pezzullo revealed in congressional testimony that the plan that the Administration had touted as the product of negotiations among Haitian democrats, denouncing Aristide for his intransigence in rejecting it (it made no provision for his return), had in fact been produced by the State Department, which brought to Washington selected Haitians to ratify it, among them Duvalierist collaborators of the murderous police chief Col. Francois. Something new was needed.

<P>Pezzullo was replaced by William Gray, a more credible voice. In May Clinton instituted a new and more humane refugee policy, which "will mean the forcible return of 95 percent of boat people instead of 100 percent," a Human Rights Watch Haiti analyst observed, pointing out that "The US policy excludes people who are not high profile but are persecuted nonetheless." The new policy is just "window dressing," the national refugee coordinator of Amnesty International added.

<P>But 5% of the boat people fleeing persecution is beyond what the United States can be expected to handle. It will "devastate Florida," a Republican congressional staff member complained. Explaining a few days later why the U.S. might have to invade, "Mr. Clinton saved his strongest warning for what he described as `the continuous possibility' that Haitians left poor and desperate under military rule would join in a `massive outflow' and seek refuge in the United States," the <CITE>Times</CITE> reported; the terms "poor and desperate" convey the doctrine that these are economic refugees. Overcrowded and destitute, the United States plainly cannot bear the burden of accepting refugees or even housing them until their claims of persecution are rejected; and surely it has no historical responsibilities in the matter. The President piteously pleaded with other countries to help us in our plight.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.34" HREF="#FN2.34">34</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Curiously, the anguished debate over this issue missed the obvious candidate: Tanzania, which had just then accommodated hundreds of thousands of Rwandans, and could surely come to the rescue of the beleaguered United States by accepting a few thousand more black faces.

<P>On May 21, an embargo was announced which, for the first time, may have some serious intent. The "assembly plant" exemption was quietly removed, and the Dominican border was (at least briefly) closed. The long-known involvement of the Haitian military in narcotrafficking was also officially reported. "We're not going to say, `Let the masses and the middle class suffer, but the very wealthy don't have to pay a price," a senior Administration official stated. "Even Wealthy Haitians Starting to Feel Pinched," a <CITE>Times</CITE> headline read, again letting out the real story of the efforts to "restore democracy" during the 2 1/2 years since the coup. Government statements and press reports tacitly conceded what had always been clear: that the U.S. has the means, far short of military intervention, to restore democracy in Haiti, but had no intention of doing so, and still does not. What has always been required is a clear declaration of intent to restore democracy, but that cannot be given, because there is no such intent. The military and their civilian allies understand that perfectly well.

<P>In the following weeks, the U.S. banned commercial air flights and
financial transactions, while leaving crucial loopholes open. Personal assets of the coup supporters were not frozen, so they can withdraw funds from U.S. bank accounts at will and transfer money to banks abroad, Administration officials acknowledged -- a matter that may be academic, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Kweisi Mfume, observed, since "the dictators of Haiti have long ago moved their assets in anticipation of this." The sanctions also permit the families that have long dominated the economy to hold on to the monopoly of the food trade that is a major source of their wealth, including the Mevs family, which is building "a huge new oil depot here to help the army defy the embargo," French reported, adding that "Washington's hesitancy in taking firm action against the business elite and the army is a result of a long history of close ties and perceived common interests," if not fear of "a spate of embarrassing revelations made by Haitians in reprisal for a crackdown."

<P>After sanctions were finally imposed in May 1994, a U.S. diplomat conceded that the continuing failure to move against the richest families has left "a perception out there of sending mixed messages and having double agendas." Other diplomats and Haitian experts agree that the decision not to target key civilian supporters of the coup is yet another mixed signal, noting particularly the relief granted the Mev, Brandt, Acra and Madsen families, who "still have a role to play," a U.S. Embassy source informed the press, though they have made no effort to disguise their support for the coup. Washington is "imposing sanctions designed to strangle the country into restoring Aristide at the same time they are telling the people who backed the coup and are in business with the military in keeping Aristide out that they are free to lead their privileged lives," another diplomat said. Haitian Senators who lead the anti-Aristide movement were not denied their permanent U.S. resident status, including Bernard Sansaricq, who played a leading role in installing the puppet civilian government with its new "president" Emile Jonassaint, appointed to replace Aristide.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.35" HREF="#FN2.35">35</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Meanwhile, the serious work of undermining the basis for democracy continues unhampered. By the time Clinton took office, as Americas Watch reported, the terror had already decimated the popular organizations that would allow Aristide "to exert civilian authority," even if he were eventually permitted to return. As Clinton finally agreed to sanctions 16 months later, Douglas Farah reported in the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> that "the army and its allies have damaged democratic institutions and grass-roots organizations that had begun to grow in Haiti to such an extent that they would take years to rebuild even if Haiti's military leaders surrendered power, according to diplomats and human rights monitors." "The Duvalierist system will continue, with or without the return of Aristide," the leader of a now-clandestine pro-Aristide group said, a judgment endorsed by "a veteran human rights worker" who prefers anonymity "because of numerous threats against his life." "The Duvialierists have many fine days ahead of them in this country," he said: "People are losing their ability to make things happen here, and it will take many years to reverse that under the best of circumstances." Even nonpolitical community organizations have been repressed, thousands of community leaders have been driven into hiding along with hundreds of thousands of others, while over 4000 have been murdered outright. The "massive terrorism," Farah reports, is "aimed at dismantling the last vestiges of organized support" for Aristide, while the civilian allies of the army and police in FRAPH have "become a very efficient machine of repression," which will remain the only authority even if Aristide were to return, the same human rights worker comments. Members of the popular organizations interviewed in hiding have "applied for political asylum at the U.S. Embassy and been denied.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.36" HREF="#FN2.36">36</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>To ensure a smooth transition to the intended post-coup system, with the "moderates" in charge and the Duvalierists preserving order, FRAPH and USAID-funded groups linked to it are establishing a monopoly of social services, so that "the poor who are compliant and docile get health services," a Haitian doctor explains. This is the "soft side" of counterinsurgency, on the model of Guatemala and other terror states. Meanwhile we are to ponder the question of whether Haitians "can muster the maturity and cohesiveness to forge a working democracy" (Howard French), or whether we must labor for decades in a (perhaps vain) effort to overcome the defects -- cultural, if not genetic -- that had been discerned by Wilson's Secretary of State and Carter's USAID director in Haiti.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.37" HREF="#FN2.37">37</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As the Bush Administration prepared to hand over the reins, a senior UN official observed that its dislike of Aristide was an open secret: "Two lines about Haiti co-existed at the time. There was the line about `return to democracy,' which was for public consumption. And then there was a second line, spoken privately within the administration. And the Haitian military knew it perfectly well." A year later, after the <CITE>Harlan County</CITE> affair gave birth to FRAPH, a French military adviser updated the picture: "Do you know what the real problem is? The Americans don't want Aristide back, and they want the rest of us out" -- "the rest of us" being Canada, France and Venezuela, the other three of "Aristide's so-called Four Friends."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2.38" HREF="#FN2.38">38</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>That this judgment is exactly right has been apparent throughout. It should be clear, however, that the issue is not Aristide personally. The problem is the forces he represents: the lively and vibrant popular movements that swept him into office, greatly alarming the rich and powerful in Haiti and their American counterparts, and teaching lessons in democracy that have to be silenced, for who can tell what minds they might reach?

<P>We are approaching the five-year mark since the fall of the Berlin wall, which marked the definitive end of the Cold War. At last the United States was freed from the burden of defending the world against Russian aggression and could return to its traditional calling: to promote democracy, human rights, and free markets worldwide. Standard doctrine holds further that the promise has been fulfilled. Today "American motives are largely humanitarian," historian David Fromkin declares in the <CITE>New York Times Magazine.</CITE> The present danger is excess of benevolence; we might undertake yet another selfless mission of mercy, failing to understand that "there are limits to what outsiders can do" and that "the armies we dispatch to foreign soil for humanitarian reasons" may not be able "to save people from others or from themselves."

<P>The view is shared by the leading establishment critic of Cold War policies, George Kennan, who writes that it was a historic error for the US to reject any effort to negotiate a peaceful settlement of conflicts with the Russians for 40 years; one of the benefits of the end of the Cold War is that the clouds are finally lifting on these issues. Kennan too counsels that we restrict our foreign engagements. We must bear in mind that "it is primarily by example, never by precept, that a country such as ours exerts the most useful influence beyond its border"; countries unlike ours may undertake the grubbier pursuits. We must also remember "that there are limits to what one sovereign country can do to help another," even "a country such as ours." Others question that stance on the grounds that it is unfair to deprive suffering humanity of our attention, necessarily benevolent.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>To qualify for membership in respectable society, one must appreciate a simple thesis: we are perfect. Therefore we need only ask what is the right course for a saintly power, how best we may proceed to "save people from others or from themselves" -- not from us, surely. The tune is, in fact, a very familiar one, an interesting topic for some other time.

<P>Like earlier angelic powers, we are able to recognize that there are some flaws and errors in the record. But the sophisticated understand that history can teach no lessons about our institutions and the ways they have functioned, surely nothing about what may lie ahead. Review of the historical record is nothing more than "sound-bites and invectives about Washington's historically evil foreign policy," Brown University professor Thomas Weiss writes with derision, hence "easy to ignore."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></FONT></SUP> A perceptive comment, accurately discerning the most valued principles of the commissar culture.

<P>Discussion of the fashionable topic of the moral obligation of humanitarian intervention -- not a trivial question -- is rarely tainted by concerns about such matters. We do not, of course, counsel that Iran should undertake humanitarian intervention in Bosnia, as it has offered to do. Why? Because of its record and the nature of its institutions. In the case of Iran -- or anyone else -- inquiry into these questions is appropriate. But not for us, given our necessary perfection.

<P>It follows that any departures from the path of righteousness can only have been a reaction -- perhaps excessive, though understandable -- to terrible dangers from which we defended ourselves, and more recently, the entire civilized world. The Cold War provides the favored current formula: any lapse in recent years is attributable to the cosmic struggle with the Russians. Thus if experimental subjects for radiation studies were chosen from Boston's Fernald School for mentally retarded children, not an elite prep school, that was unfortunate, but understandable in the atmosphere of the Cold War, so it is alleged -- about as plausibly as in most other cases. And we have now "changed course," so that history may rest in peace.

<P>At the critical extreme, we do find occasional notice of imperfection. "There's something troubling about the way we select our cases for intervention," Harvard historian Stanley Hoffmann observed in opening a conference at Tufts university. He noted that there has been no "international cry to intervene in ethnic bloodshed in East Timor," the <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> reported. The example is instructive.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Let us disregard the phrase "ethnic bloodshed," not quite the term applied to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. That aside, some obvious questions come to mind: just who might call for such intervention, and how should it proceed? By bombing Washington and London, the main supporters of Indonesia's aggression and mass slaughter? Suppose that a commentator in pre-Gorbachev Russia had found something troubling about Soviet intervention policy, wondering why Russia did not intervene to prevent the imposition of martial law in Poland or repression in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Would we even laugh? How could Moscow intervene to bar the policies it actively supported? These questions cannot arise, however, in our case, whatever the facts, given our perfection. No one laughs.

<P>Respectable British opinion is scarcely different. Writing in the (London) <CITE>Times Higher Education Supplement,</CITE> Leslie Macfarlane, emeritus politics fellow at St. John's College in Oxford, recognizes that the US and UK, "to their shame, failed to put pressure on President Suharto to refrain from invasion" of East Timor. But the 200,000 or more deaths "cannot be attributed to `the West'," he adds, reproaching Edward Herman for his calculations of the costs of Western state terrorism which erroneously included this case: no "Western promotion or support for the invasion and pacification of East Timor in the early 1980s [sic] is laid at the West's door," Macfarlane instructs us with proper indignation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>There is no need to review the facts, familiar outside of the doctrinal system, which not only suppressed them with great efficiency as the terrible story unfolded but continues to do so today. Right now, Western oil companies are plundering East Timor's oil under a treaty between Australia and Indonesia, terror and repression continue unabated, and new atrocities have been discovered from the very recent past, among them, the slaughter of many people by Indonesian doctors in hospitals after the November 1991 Dili massacre. But we must understand that the news room is a busy place, and some things inevitably seep through the cracks -- in a remarkably systematic way. Who can be expected to notice prominent stories in the British and Australian press, including even the <CITE>Guardian Weekly,</CITE> widely circulated here? One wonders whether the news room would have been too busy to notice Libyan robbery of Kuwaiti oil under a treaty with Saddam Hussein, after he had occupied and annexed the country.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the United States, public protest has hampered government support for Indonesian atrocities, but not much. Congress cut off funds for military training, but the Clinton Administration was undeterred. On the anniversary of the US-backed Indonesian invasion, the State Department announced that "Congress's action did not ban Indonesia's purchase of training with its own funds," so it can proceed despite the ban. Such training has, after all, been quite successful in the past, including the training of officers who took part in the highly praised slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people, mostly landless peasants, as the present government took power in 1965. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara took particular pride in that fact, informing LBJ that US military assistance to the Indonesian army had "encouraged it" to undertake the useful slaughter "when the opportunity was presented." Particularly valuable, McNamara said, was the program that brought Indonesian military personnel to the United States for training at universities. Congress agreed, noting the "enormous dividends" of US military training of the killers and continued communication with them. The same training expedited the war crimes in Timor, and much else.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Plainly, it would be unfair to deprive the people of the region of such benefits. That is exactly the position taken by advocates of US military training, for example Senator Bennett Johnson. His evidence is a quote from the Commander of the US forces in the Pacific, Admiral Larson, who explains that "by studying in our schools," Indonesian army officers "gain an appreciation for our value system, specifically respect for human rights, adherence to democratic principles, and the rule of law." For similar reasons, we must allow arms sales to Indonesia, so that we can continue to have a constructive "dialogue" and maintain our "leverage and influence," so benignly exercised in the past, much as in Latin America, Haiti, the Philippines, and other places where US training has instilled such admirable respect for human rights.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<H3>1. Defending Human Rights</H3>

<P>With the support of Senate Democrats, the Administration was also able to block human rights conditions on aid to Indonesia. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced further that Washington would "suspend" its annual review of Indonesian labor practices. Agreeing with Senator Bennett, who is impressed by "the steps Indonesia has taken...to improve conditions for workers in Indonesia," Kantor commended Indonesia for "bringing its labor law and practice into closer conformity with international standards" -- a witticism that is in particularly poor taste, though it must be conceded that Indonesia did take some steps forward, fearing that Congress might override its friends in the White House. "Reforms hastily pushed through by the Indonesian government in recent months include withdrawing the authority of the military to intervene in strikes, allowing workers to form a company union to negotiate labour contracts, and raising the minimum wage in Jakarta by 27%" to about $2 a day, the London <CITE>Guardian</CITE> reports. The new company unions that are magnanimously authorized must, to be sure, join the All-Indonesia Labor Union, the state-run union. To ensure that these promising advances toward international labor standards would not be misunderstood, authorities also arrested 21 labor activists.

<P>"We have done much to change and improve," Indonesia's Foreign Minister said, "so according to us there is no reason to revoke" the trade privileges. Clinton liberals evidently agree.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>One effect of the activism of the 1960s was the pressure on Congress to impose human rights conditions on aid, trade, and military sales. Every Administration from Carter until today has had to seek ways to evade such constraints. In the 1980s, it became a sick joke, as the Reaganites regularly assured Congress (always happy to be "deceived") that its favorite assassins and torturers were making impressive progress. Clinton is forging no new paths with his Indonesia chicanery.

<P>Other tasks are proving harder, however, notably China, which must have its Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status renewed by June. As I've reviewed in earlier articles, China is not giving poor Clinton much help in his endeavor to bypass the executive order that he issued imposing human rights conditions -- in "fear that Congressional Democrats might otherwise have forced an even more stringent approach" through legislation, Thomas Friedman reports in the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> and because Clinton "did not want to appear to be going back on another campaign promise," having "strongly criticized President Bush for `coddling' China."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The problem arose again as Warren Christopher visited Beijing in March to express Washington's concerns on human rights, which, the State Department hastened to explain, are quite limited -- in fact, limited to finding means to evade Congressional pressures. John Shattuck, US assistant secretary of human rights, clarified to the Chinese leaders that Clinton's requirements for improvement are "very narrow," that pledges of progress may be enough: "What the president is looking for is an indication of direction...that is generally forward looking." Please, please, give us some straw, so that we can respond to the needs of our constituency in the corporate sector. The Chinese, however, seem to enjoy watching their partners twist in the wind.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As Christopher left for China, the Administration announced that it would once again relax the sanctions on high technology transfers, this time by allowing the Hughes Aircraft Company to launch a satellite from China. This "gesture of good will toward Beijing" is one "part of the strategy to engage China rather than to isolate it," Elaine Sciolino reported in the <CITE>New York Times.</CITE> Asked about this decision while China is under pressure on issues of missile proliferation and human rights, Christopher responded that it "simply sends a signal of even-handed treatment." The "good will gesture," as usual, is directed towards a leading segment of the publicly subsidized "private enterprise" system, much like the "good-will gestures" announced at the Asia-Pacific summit last November, which allowed China to purchase supercomputers, nuclear power generators, and satellites despite their adaptability to weapons and missile proliferation. The Pentagon also sent high officials with Christopher "to discuss ways to upgrade the two countries' military relationship," Sciolino reported, another part of the "strategy."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Christopher did not return empty-handed. At a White House session, Thomas Friedman reports, he "presented a chart...showing that on many fronts China was making some progress toward meeting the terms of the President's executive order, but that forward movement had been obscured by the confrontational atmosphere of his visit." On leaving Beijing, he had stated that his discussions with the Chinese leaders were "businesslike and productive." "The differences between China and the US are narrowing somewhat," Christopher informed the press, though he "was hard put to point to examples of specific progress on the vexed human rights issue beyond a memorandum of understanding on trade in prison labour products," the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> commented. China did (once again) agree to restrict exports from prison factories to the United States.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Such exports have greatly exercised Washington and the press, the sole labor rights issue to have achieved this status. "U.S. Inspections of Jail Exports Likely in China," a front-page story by Thomas Friedman was headlined in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> in January. The Chinese "agreed to a demand to allow more visits by American customs inspectors to Chinese prison factories to make sure they are not producing goods for export to the United States," he reported from Beijing. US influence is having further benign effects, "forcing liberalization, factory by factory," including contract, bankruptcy, and other laws that are "critical elements of a market economy," all welcome steps towards a "virtuous circle."

<P>Unmentioned are a few other questions about economic virtue: horrifying labor conditions, for example. Perhaps the case of 81 women burned to death locked into their factory last November, which merited a few lines in the national press in the midst of much euphoria about Clinton's grand vision of a free market future in the Asia-Pacific region. Or 60 workers killed in a fire a few weeks later in another foreign-owned factory. Or the doubling of deaths in industrial accidents last year, with over 11,000 just in the first eight months. "Chinese officials and analysts say the accidents stem from abysmal working conditions, which, combined with long hours, inadequate pay, and even physical beatings, are stirring unprecedented labor unrest among China's booming foreign joint ventures," Sheila Tefft reported in the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor.</CITE> That problem is a real one: "the tensions reveal the great gap between competitive foreign capitalists lured by cheap Chinese labor and workers weaned on socialist job security and the safety net of cradle-to-grave benefits." Workers do not yet understand that in the capitalist utopia we are preparing for them, they are to be "beaten for producing poor quality goods, fired for dozing on the job during long work hours" and other such misdeeds, and locked into their factories to be burned to death. But we understand all of that, so China is not called to account for violations of labor rights; only for exporting prison products to the United States.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Why the distinction? Simplicity itself. Prison factories are state-owned industry, and exports to the US interfere with profits, unlike locking women into factories, beating workers, and other such means to improve the balance sheet. QED.

<P>Accuracy requires a few qualifications. Thus, the rules allow the United States to sell prison goods -- for export: they are not permitted to enter US markets. California and Oregon export prison-made clothing to Asia, including specialty jeans, shirts, and a line of shorts quaintly called "Prison Blues." The prisoners earn far less than the minimum wage, and work under "slave labor" conditions, prison rights activists allege. But their products do not interfere with the rights that count, so there is no problem here.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Clinton Administration "has been quietly signaling Beijing that if it met Washington's minimum human rights demands, the United States would consider ending the annual threat of trade sanctions to change China's behavior," Friedman reports. The reason is that the old human rights policy imposed by Congressional (ultimately popular) pressures is "outmoded and should be replaced." This is a "major shift in policy which reflects the increasing importance of trade to the American economy." The human rights policy "is also outmoded, other officials argue, because trade is now such an important instrument for opening up Chinese society, for promoting the rule of law and the freedom of movement there, and for encouraging" private property.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The hypocrisy is stunning, though hardly more than the "human rights" policy that is now "outmoded," which was always carefully crafted to avoid endangering profits and to somehow "not see" huge atrocities carried out by US clients under Washington's sponsorship. Human rights concerns have been a passion in the case of Nicaragua and Cuba, subjected to crushing embargoes and terror. In such cases, trade is not "an instrument" that induces good behavior. The criminals have to be restored to their service role; if cynical posturing about human rights contributes to that end, well and good. The same was true of the Soviet empire, which also had to be returned to its traditional Third World role, providing resources, investment opportunities, markets, cheap labor, and other amenities, as it had for hundreds of years (an essential feature of the Cold War since 1918, in the real world). Until that end was achieved, trade was not "an instrument" to help lift the chains. The same was true of China, until it began to open its doors to foreign investment and control, offering wonderful opportunities for profit -- or in technical Newspeak, "jobs."

<H3>2. Promoting Democracy</H3>

<P>Our current vocation, as everyone knows, is promoting democracy. There are many illuminating examples since the fall of the Berlin Wall freed us from the Cold War burden.

<P>The first, and one of the most revealing, is Nicaragua. Recall that just as the Wall fell, the White House and Congress announced with great clarity that unless Nicaraguans voted as we told them, the terrorist war and the embargo that was strangling the country would continue. Washington also voted (alone with Israel) against a UN General Assembly resolution calling on it once again to observe international law and call off these illegal actions; unthinkable of course, so the press continued to observe its vow of silence. When Nicaraguans met their obligations a few months later, joy was unrestrained. At the dissident extreme, Anthony Lewis hailed Washington's "experiment in peace and democracy," which gives "fresh testimony to the power of Jefferson's idea: government with the consent of the governed.... To say so seems romantic, but then we live in a romantic age." Across the spectrum there was rejoicing over the latest of the "happy series of democratic surprises," as <CITE>Time</CITE> magazine expressed the uniform view while outlining the methods used to achieve our Jeffersonian ideals: to "wreck the economy and prosecute a long and deadly proxy war until the exhausted natives overthrow the unwanted government themselves," with a cost to us that is "minimal," leaving the victim "with wrecked bridges, sabotaged power stations, and ruined farms," and providing Washington's candidate with "a winning issue," ending the "impoverishment of the people of Nicaragua."

<P>It would be hard to imagine a more conclusive demonstration of the understanding of "democracy" in the dominant political and intellectual culture. It is inconceivable that the clear and unmistakeable meaning of any of this should enter the respectable culture, or probably even history.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>That interesting story continues. On March 15, US assistant Secretary of State Alexander Watson announced that "With the conflicts of the past behind us, the Clinton administration accepts the Sandinistas as a legitimate political force in Nicaragua with all the rights and obligations of any party in a democracy supposing that it uses only peaceful and legitimate methods," as we did through the 1980s, setting the stage for a "fair election," by US standards. The brief Reuters report noted that "the United States financed the Contra rebels against the Soviet-backed Sandinista government." Translating from Newspeak, Washington followed standard procedure, doing everything it could to compel Nicaragua to abandon its despicable efforts to maintain a nonaligned stand and balanced trade and to turn to the Russians as a last resort, so that Washington's attack could be construed as part of the Cold War conflict raging in our backyard, now to be dispatched to the category of irrelevance for understanding ourselves, or what the future holds.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Washington's willingness to accept the Sandinistas as a legitimate political force, if they mind their manners, cannot claim the prize for moral cowardice and depravity. That is still held by Washington's display of magnanimity towards the Vietnamese, now permitted to enter the civilized world, their many crimes against us put to the side (though not, of course, forgiven) once US business made it clear that the pleasure of torturing our victims must give way to the more important task of enrichment of the wealthy.

<P>The next example of our post-Cold War passion for democracy was the invasion of Panama a month after the Berlin Wall fell, the first exercise of humanitarian intervention in the post-Cold War era. Operation Just Cause may have served as a model for Saddam Hussein shortly after, the cheering section now quietly concedes. Bush's greatest fear when Iraq invaded Kuwait seems to have been that Saddam would mimic his achievement in Panama. According to the account of Washington planning by investigative reporter Bob Woodward, regarded as "generally convincing" by US government Middle East specialist William Quandt, President Bush feared that the Saudis would "bug out at the last minute and accept a puppet regime in Kuwait" after Iraqi withdrawal. His advisers expected that Iraq would withdraw, leaving behind "lots of Iraqi special forces in civilian clothes," if not armed forces as the US did in Panama, while taking over two uninhabited mudflats that had been assigned to Kuwait in the British imperial settlement to block Iraq's access to the sea (Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf). Chief of Staff Gen. Colin Powell warned that the status quo would be changed under the influence of the aggressors even after withdrawal, again as in Panama.

<P>In a highly-praised academic study regarded as the standard current work of scholarship on this "textbook case of aggression" and the reaction to it, University of London historians Lawrence Freedman and Efraim Karsh, who labor to present the US-UK effort in the most favorable possible light, conclude that "Saddam apparently intended neither officially to annex the tiny emirate nor to maintain a permanent military presence there. Instead, he sought to establish hegemony over Kuwait, ensuring its complete financial, political and strategic subservience to his wishes," much as intended by the US in Panama, and achieved. Saddam's scheme "turned sour," they continue, because of the international reaction; to translate to doctrinally unacceptable truth, because the US and Britain did not follow their usual practice of vetoing or otherwise nullifying the international reaction to such "textbook cases of aggression" as US-South Vietnam, Turkey-Cyprus, Indonesia-East Timor, Israel-Lebanon, US-Panama, and many others.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Operation Just Cause was presented as a "textbook case" of Washington's dedication to democracy -- quite accurately, as it turned out. In the latest of its annual reports on human rights (January, 1994), Panama's governmental Human Rights Commission charged that the right to self-determination and sovereignty of the Panamanian people continues to be violated by the "state of occupation by a foreign army," reviewing US army, airforce, and DEA operations in Panama, including a DEA agent's assault on a Panamanian journalist and attacks on Panamanian citizens by US military personnel. The nongovernmental Human Rights Commission, in its accompanying report "Democracy and Human Rights in Panama...Four Years Later" added that democracy has meant nothing more than formal voting while government policies "do not attend to the necessities of the most impoverished" -- whose numbers have significantly increased since the "liberation." Within a year after the invasion, Latin Americanist Stephen Ropp observes, Washington was well aware "that removing the mantle of United States protection would quickly result in a civilian or military overthrow of [President] Endara and his supporters"-- that is, the puppet regime of bankers, businessmen, and narcotraffickers installed by the occupying army. "Drugs and their rewards are more visible today than in General Noriega's time," the <CITE>Economist</CITE> reports in March, including hard drugs. A senior employee of the Panama Branch of Merrill Lynch was one of those recently caught in a DEA operation as they were laundering Colombian cocaine cash through Panama's large financial industry, the one real economic success story of the "occupation by a foreign army." "All they were doing is what almost every bank in Panama does," a local investigative reporter commented. All exactly as predicted when the troops landed to restore the mainly white oligarchy to power and ensure US control over the strategically important region and its financial institutions.

<P>An election is scheduled for May. Far ahead in polls is Perez Balladares, the candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), the party of populist dictator Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega. Balladares was Noriega's campaign manager for the 1989 election that Noriega stole, causing much outrage in the US because he was no longer following Washington's orders; when he was still a "good boy" in 1984, he was lauded by Reagan, Shultz, et al. for stealing the election with considerably greater fraud and violence. Balladares has learned his lessons and should cause no problems.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Other exercises of "democracy enhancement" in the region proceed on course. In November 1993, Hondurans went to the polls for the fourth time since 1980. They voted against the neoliberal structural adjustment programs that have had the usual consequences. But the gesture is empty; the rich and powerful will permit nothing else. "The voters have no real options for improving their living standards which worsen every day," Mexico's major newspaper <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> reported -- familiar with "economic miracles" in its own country. Three-fourths of those who went to the polls "live in misery and are disenchanted with formal democracy." Hondurans' purchasing power is lower than in the 1970s, before the gift of "democracy" was granted by the United States while turning Honduras into a military base for its war against Nicaragua and establishing more firmly the rule of the generals. There are other beneficiaries, the Honduran College of Economists points out: "a group of privileged exporters and local investors linked to financial capital and multinational corporations who have multiplied their capital" in a country where "growing economic polarization is generating ever more evident constrasts, between the rich who do not hide the ostentation of their moral misery and the every more miserable poor." "At least one of every two dollars coming to Honduras has left in the last three years [1991-93] to pay the interest on more than $3 billion foreign debt," <CITE>Excelsior</CITE> continues. Debt service now represents 40% of exports; and though almost 20% of the debt was forgiven, it has increased by almost 10% since 1990.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In March 1994, the "democracy enhancement" project reached El Salvador. The elections conducted in the 1980s to legitimize the US-backed terror state were hailed at the time as impressive steps towards democracy ("demonstration elections," as Edward Herman accurately called them). But with the policy imperatives of those days gone, the pretense has been quietly shelved. It is the 1994 elections that are to represent the triumph of Washington's dedication to democracy.

<P>The elections are indeed an innovation in that at least the forms were maintained, pretty much. "Tens of thousands of voters who had electoral cards were unable to vote because they did not appear on electoral lists," the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> reported, "while some 74,000 people, a high number of which were from areas believed to be sympathetic to the FMLN, were excluded because they did not have birth certificates." FMLN leaders alleged that more than 300,000 voters were excluded in such ways, charging "massive" fraud. The left coalition presidential candidate Rubn Zamora estimated "conservatively" that over 10% of voters were barred. The UN mission downplayed the problems, but independent observers were not convinced. "I used to give them the benefit of the doubt," the official British observer commented, "but it comes to the point when you have to say it is bad faith," referring to the "bad administration" of the election by the governing ARENA party, which received almost half the votes cast, and the UN mission reaction.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>But the irregularities, whatever they may have been, do not change the fact that the elections broke new ground at a formal level. There was no blatant fraud or massive terror; rather, minor fraud against the background of the successful use of terror and repression, with a narrow aspect that received some attention, and a broader and more significant one that did not.

<P>In the 1994 elections, the US naturally supported ARENA, the party of the death squads, a fact understood throughout though denied for propaganda reasons. Partial declassification of documents has revealed that much. It also illustrates once again why documents are classified in the first place: not for security reasons, as alleged, but to undermine American democracy by protecting state power from popular scrutiny. In February 1985 the CIA reported that "behind ARENA's legitimate exterior lies a terrorist network led by D'Aubuisson and funded by wealthy Salvadoran expatriates residing in Guatemala and the United States," using "both active-duty and retired military personnel in their campaigns"; "death squads in the armed forces operate out of both urban military headquarters and rural outposts." The main death squad, the "Secret Anti-Communist Army," was described by the CIA as the "paramilitary organization" of ARENA, led by the Constituent Assembly security chief and drawing most of its members from the National Police and other security forces. The military and police themselves, of course, were the major terrorist forces, carrying out the great mass of the atrocities against the civilian population, funded directly from Washington, which was also responsible for their training and direction.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As the 1994 elections approached, there was a "resurgence in death squad-style murders and death threats," Americas Watch observed, concluding that "no issue represents a greater threat to the peace process than the rise in political murders of leaders and grassroots activists" of the FMLN, assassinations that "became more frequent, brazen, and selective in the fall of 1993." These "injected a level of fear, almost impossible to measure, into the campaign," enhanced by government cover-ups and refusal to investigate, part of a pattern of violation of the peace treaty, to which we return. The government's own human rights office and the UN Observer Mission reported the "grave deterioration in citizen security" made worse by "organized violence in the political arena." This proceeds against the backdrop of an "astronomical rise of crime in post-war El Salvador," Americas Watch reports, and "reliable" evidence that the army and National Police are involved in organized crime.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The major political opposition, Rubn Zamora's left coalition, not only lacked resources for the campaign that was virtually monopolized by ARENA, but was "unable to convince supporters or sympathizers to appear in campaign ads because they fear retaliation from the right" (<CITE>New York Times</CITE>). Terror continued at a level sufficient to give substance to such fears. Among those who took the threat seriously was Jos Mar!a Mendez, named El Salvador's "Lawyer of the Century" by three prestigious legal associations. He fled the country shortly after, threatened with death unless he convinced the vice-presidential candidate of the left coalition to resign.

<P>Foreign observers were struck by the lack of popular interest in the "elections of the century." "Salvadorans Ambivalent Toward Historic Poll," a headline in the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE> read, reporting fear and apathy, and concern that war will return unless ARENA wins. The abstention rate, about 45%, was about the same as 10 years earlier, at the peak of the violence. A "conservative political analyst" quoted by the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> (Hctor Dada) attributed the low participation "to a deliberate disenfranchisment of voters and a sense of apathy among the electorate." As for those who voted, another analyst, Luis Cardenal, observed that "the electorate voted more than anything for tranquillity, for security." "The war-weary populace bought the ruling party's party line, which equated ARENA with security and the left with instability and violence," <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE> reporter David Clark Scott added. That is plausible enough. Any other outcome could be expected to lead to revival of the large-scale terror and atrocities.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>These assessments bear on the broader aspects of the successful use of violence. Before the election, church and popular sources attributed the "climate of apathy" to the fact that "hunger and poverty reign among a population whose demands have received no attention, which makes the electoral climate difficult" (Notimex, Mexico).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT25" HREF="#FN25">25</A></FONT></SUP> In the 1970s, popular organizations were proliferating, in part under church auspices, seeking to articulate these demands in the political arena and to work to overcome hunger, poverty, and harsh oppression. It was that popular awakening that elicited the response of the state terror apparatus and its superpower sponsor, committed as always to a form of "democracy enhancement" that bars the threat of democracy -- by extreme violence, if necessary, as in this case. Here as elsewhere, the programs of the terrorist superpower were highly successful, leading to the "climate of apathy," the search for security above all else, and the general conditions in which "free elections" become tolerable.

<P>Recall the conclusion of Reaganite official Thomas Carothers, who recognizes that the "democracy enhancement" programs in which he was involved "inevitably sought only limited, top-down forms of democratic change that did not risk upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied," maintaining "the basic order of...quite undemocratic societies" and avoiding "populist-based change" that might upset "established economic and political orders" and open "a leftist direction." Nothing has changed in this regard.

<P>A January 1994 conference of Jesuits and lay associates in San Salvador considered both the narrow and broad aspects of the state terrorist project. Its summary report concludes that "It is important to explore to what degree terror continues to act, cloaked by the mask of common crime. Also to be explored is what weight the culture of terror has had in domesticating the expectations of the majority vis-a-vis alternatives different to those of the powerful, in a context in which many of the revolutionaries of yesterday act today with values similar to the long powerful."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT26" HREF="#FN26">26</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The latter issue, the broader one, is of particular significance. The great achievement of the massive terror operations of the past years organized by Washington and its local associates has been to destroy hope. The observation generalizes to much of the Third World and also to the growing masses of superfluous people at home, as the Third World model of sharply two-tiered societies is increasingly internationalized. These are major themes of the "New World Order" being constructed by the privileged sectors of global society, with US state and private power in the lead.

<H3>3. Rewarding Democracy</H3>

<P>A particularly instructive illustration of the democracy enhancement program in the region is Colombia, which seems to have taken first place in the competition for leading terrorist state in Latin America -- and, to the surprise of no one familiar with "sound-bites and invectives about Washington's historically evil foreign policy," has become the leading recipient of US military aid, accompanied by much praise for its stellar accomplishments.

<P>In the March 1994 issue of <CITE>Current History,</CITE> Latin Americanist John Martz writes that "Colombia now enjoys one of the healthiest and most flourishing economies in Latin America. And in political terms its democratic structures, notwithstanding inevitable flaws, are among the most solid on the continent," a model of "well-established political stability." The Clinton Administration is particularly impressed by outgoing President Csar Gaviria, whom it is now promoting as next Secretary General of the Organization of American States, because, as the US representative to the OAS explained, "He has been very forward looking in building democratic institutions in a country where it was sometimes dangerous to do so" and also "on economic reform in Colombia and on economic integration in the hemisphere," code words that are readily interpreted.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT27" HREF="#FN27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>That it has been dangerous to build democratic institutions in Colombia is true enough, thanks primarily to President Gaviria, his predecessors, and their fervent supporters in Washington.

<P>The "inevitable flaws" are reviewed in some detail -- once again -- in current publications of Americas Watch and Amnesty International.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT28" HREF="#FN28">28</A></FONT></SUP> They find "appalling levels of violence," the worst in the hemisphere. Since 1986, more than 20,000 people have been killed for political reasons, most of them by the Colombian military and police and the paramilitary forces that are closely linked to them; for example, the private army of rancher, emerald dealer, and reputed drug dealer Victor Carranza, considered to be the largest in the country, dedicated primarily to the destruction of the leftwing political opposition Patriotic Union (UP), in alliance with police and military officers. The department in which Carranza operates (Meta) is one of the most heavily militarized, with some 35,000 troops and thousands of police. Nevertheless, paramilitary forces and hired killers operate freely, carrying out massacres and political assassinations. An official government inquiry in the early '80s found that over a third of the members of paramilitary groups engaged in political killings and other terror in Colombia were active-duty military officers; the pattern continues, including the usual alliances with private power and criminal sectors.

<P>More than 1500 leaders, members and supporters of UP have been assassinated since the party was established in 1985. This "systematic elimination of the leadership" of UP is "the most dramatic expression of political intolerance in recent years," AI observes -- one of the "inevitable flaws" that make it "dangerous to build democratic institutions," if not quite the danger that the Clinton Administration wants us to notice. Other "dangers" were illustrated at the March 1994 elections, largely bought by the powerful Cali cocaine cartel, critics allege, noting the history of vote-buying in this "stable democracy," the vast amounts of money spent by the cartel, and the low turnout.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT29" HREF="#FN29">29</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The pretext for terror operations is the war against guerrillas and narcotraffickers, the former a very partial truth, the latter "a myth," Amnesty International concludes in agreement with other investigators; the myth was concocted in large measure to replace the "Communist threat" as the Cold War was fading along with the propaganda system based on it. In reality, the official security forces and their paramilitary associates work hand in glove with the drug lords, organized crime, landowners, and other private interests in a country where avenues of social action have long been closed, and are to be kept that way by intimidation and terror. The Government's own Commission to Overcome Violence concluded that "the criminalization of social protest" is one of the "principal factors which permit and encourage violations of human rights" by the military and police authorities and their paramilitary collaborators.

<P>The problems have become much worse in the past 10 years, particularly during President Gaviria's term, when "violence reached unprecedented levels," the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) reports, with the National Police taking over as the leading official killers while US aid shifted to them. 1992 was the most violent year in Colombia since the 1950s, WOLA reported in early 1993, which proved to be still worse.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT30" HREF="#FN30">30</A></FONT></SUP> Atrocities run the gamut familiar in the spheres of US influence and support: death squads, "disappearance," torture, rape, massacre of civilian populations under the doctrine of "collective responsibility," and aerial bombardment. The specially-trained counterinsurgency and mobile brigades are among the worst offenders. Targets include community leaders, human rights and health workers, union activists, students, members of religious youth organizations, and young people in shanty towns, but primarily peasants. Merely to give one example, from August 1992 to August 1993, 217 union activists were murdered, "a point that demonstrates the strong intolerance on the part of the State of union activity," the Andean Commission of Jurists comments.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT31" HREF="#FN31">31</A></FONT></SUP> The official concept of "terrorism" has been extended to virtually anyone opposing government policies, the human rights reports observe.

<P>One project of the security forces and their allies is "social cleansing" -- that is, murder of vagrants and unemployed, street children, prostitutes, homosexuals, and other undesirables. The Ministry of Defense formulated the official attitude toward the matter in response to a compensation claim: "There is no case for the payment of any compensation by the nation, particularly for an individual who was neither useful nor productive, either to society or to his family."

<P>The security forces also murder suspects, another practice familiar in US domains. It is, for example, standard operating procedure for Israeli forces in the occupied territories, passing with little notice among the paymasters, who accept it as routine. Thus, the day before the Hebron massacre of February 25, soldiers fired antitank rockets and grenades at a stone house near Jerusalem, killing one Palestinian and wounding another who were "accused by the army in the slaying of an undercover agent" and other actions, the press casually reported.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT32" HREF="#FN32">32</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The plague of murder for sale of organs, rampant through the domains of US influence, has not spared Colombia, where undesirables are killed so that their corpses "can be chopped up and sold on the black market for body parts" (AI). It is not known whether children are sold and killed for organ transplants as in El Salvador, where the practice is officially conceded; and according to extensive report, elsewhere in the region.

<P>As Human Rights groups and others observe, the Colombian model is that of El Salvador and Guatemala. The doctrines instilled by US advisers and trainers can be traced back directly to the Nazis, as Michael McClintock documented in an important study that has been ignored. Colombia has also enjoyed the assistance of British, German, and Israeli mercenaries who train assassins and perform other services for the narco-military-landlord combine in their war against peasants and potential social activism. to my knowledge, there has been no attempt to investigate the report of Colombian intelligence that North Americans have also been engaged in these operations, or any notice of it, in the mainstream.

<P>Other similarities to Washington's Salvador-Guatemala model abound. Consider, for example, the case of Major Luis Felipe Becerra, charged with responsibility for an army massacre by a civilian judge, who fled the country under death threats days after issuing the arrest warrant (her father was then murdered). But the warrants were not served, because Major Becerra was then in the United States undergoing a training course for promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel. Returning after his promotion, Lt.-Col. Becerra was appointed to head the army's press and public relations department, despite a recommendation by the Procurator Delegate to the Armed Forces that he be dismissed for his part in the peasant massacre. In April 1993, charges against him were dropped. In October, he was again implicated in a massacre of unarmed civilians. Under the pretext of a battle against guerrillas, troops under his command executed 13 people in a rural area; the victims were unarmed, the women were raped and tortured, according to residents of the area.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT33" HREF="#FN33">33</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>But impunity prevails, as is regularly the case.

<P>The story is that of Central America, Haiti, Brazil, indeed wherever the Monroe Doctrine extends, along with the Philippines, Iran under the Shah, and other countries that share an elusive property.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT34" HREF="#FN34">34</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Whatever could it be? Whatever it is, we are strictly enjoined not to see it and to learn nothing from it.

<P>A detailed 1992 investigation by European and Latin American church and human rights organizations concludes that "state terrorism in Colombia is a reality: it has its institutions, its doctrine, its structures, its legal arrangements, its means and instruments, its victims, and above all its responsible authorities." Its goal is "systematic elimination of opposition, criminalization of large sectors of the population, massive resort to political assassination and disappearance, general use of torture, extreme powers for the security forces, exceptional legislation, etc..." (<CITE>State Terror in Colombia</CITE>). The modern version has its roots in the security doctrines pioneered by the Kennedy Administration, which established them officially in a crucial 1962 decision that shifted the mission of the Latin American military from "hemispheric defense" to "internal security": the war against the "internal enemy," understood in practice to be those who challenge the traditional order of domination and control.

<P>The doctrines were expounded in US manuals of counterinsurgency and low intensity conflict, and developed further by local security authorities. They benefited from training and direction by US advisers and experts, new technologies of repression, and improved structures and methodologies to maintain "stability" and obedience. The result is a highly efficient apparatus of official terror, designed for "total war" by state power "in the political, economic, and social arenas," as the Colombian Minister of Defense articulated the standard doctrine in 1989. While officially the targets were guerrilla organizations, a high military official explained in 1987 that these were only of minor importance: "the real danger" is "what the insurgents have called the political and psychological war," the war "to control the popular elements" and "to manipulate the masses." The "subversives" hope to influence unions, universities, media, and so on. Therefore, the <CITE>State Terror</CITE> inquiry observes, the "internal enemy" of the state terrorist apparatus extends to "labor organizations, popular movements, indigenous organizations, opposition political parties, peasant movements, intellectual sectors, religious currents, youth and student groups, neighborhood organizations," and so on, all legitimate targets for destruction because they must be secured against undesirable influences. "Every individual who in one or another manner supports the goals of the enemy must be considered a traitor and treated in that manner," a 1963 military manual prescribed, as the Kennedy initiatives were moving into high gear.

<P>The war against the "internal enemy" escalated in the 1980s as the Reaganites updated the Kennedy doctrines, moving from "legal" repression to "systematic employment of political assassination and disappearance, later massacres" (<CITE>State Terror</CITE>). Atrocities escalated. A new judicial regime in 1988 "allowed maximal criminalization of the political and social opposition" in order to implement what was officially called "total war against the internal enemy." The use of paramilitary auxiliaries for terror, explicitly authorized in military manuals, also took new and more comprehensive forms; and alliances with industrialists, ranchers and landowners, and later narcotraffickers were more firmly entrenched. The 1980s saw "the consolidation of state terror in Colombia," the inquiry concludes.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT35" HREF="#FN35">35</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In its December 1993 study, America's Watch observes that "most of the materiel used by and training provided the Colombian army and police come from the United States," mainly counterinsurgency equipment and training. A study of the "drug war" by the US General Accounting Office in August 1993 concluded that US military officials have not "fully implemented end-use monitoring procedures to ensure that Colombia's military is using aid primarily for counter-narcotic purposes," an oversight with few consequences, considering what falls under the rubric of "counter-narcotic purposes." Washington's own interpretation of such purposes was nicely illustrated in early 1989 when Colombia asked it to install a radar system to monitor flights from the south, the source of most of the cocaine for the drug merchants. The US government fulfilled the request -- in a sense; it installed a radar system on San Andrs island in the Caribbean, 500 miles from mainland Colombia and as far removed as possible on Colombian territory from the drug routes, but well-located for the intensive surveillance of Nicaragua that was a critical component of the terrorist war, then peaking as Washington sought to conclude its demolition of the "peace process" of the Central American presidents (as it did, another fact unlikely to enter history). A Costa Rican request for radar assistance in the drug war ended up the same way.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT36" HREF="#FN36">36</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>>From 1984 through 1992, 6,844 Colombian soldiers were trained under the US International Military Education and Training Program, over 2,000 from 1990 to 1992, as atrocities were mounting. Like their counterparts elsewhere, they were thus able to "gain an appreciation for our value system, specifically respect for human rights, adherence to democratic principles, and the rule of law," as Admiral Larson and Senator Bennett explained. The Colombian program is the largest in the hemisphere, three times that of El Salvador. US advisors are helping build military bases, officially to "increase the battlefronts against the guerrillas and narcotrafficking operations." Four have been constructed, five more are underway, according to the US Embassy. The real targets will be evident from the record elsewhere in the region, or in Colombia itself.

<P>Washington is also supporting the "public order" courts that operate under conditions that severely undermine civil rights and due process. Again, the parallel to El Salvador is obvious. One of the requirements of the UN-brokered peace accord was that the Salvadoran government dismantle the Supreme Court, largely an appendage of the death squad apparatus run by the state and its private sector allies. The agreement was ignored, like the requirement that the National Police, noted for their brutality, be dismantled and replaced by a new National Civilan Police (PNC) that is not under army control and includes the FMLN. "Government figures...show that instead of phasing out the old national police force as called for by the peace accord, it actually has increased by about 2,000 men to 10,500," the <CITE>Chicago Tribune</CITE> reported. In further violation of the agreement, the ARENA government in 1992 transferred to the National Police 1,000 members of the Treasury Police and National Guard, which were to be abolished because of their notorious human rights abuses; former members were accepted to training programs for the PNC, "an explicit violation of the accord," Americas Watch notes. The expanding National Police are considered responsible for 35% of human rights violations reported to the UN observers in 1993, "a larger share than any other force," Americas Watch continues, reviewing also a series of other government violations of the accords designed to sustain the terror system, either in official or "privatized" form. "Time is on the side of the government," a UN official observed: it is only necessary to hold out until the UN Mission ends, and then the remnants of the peace accords can be completely scrapped, going the way of the Central American peace accords of 1987.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT37" HREF="#FN37">37</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Since there is no interest here, El Salvador too proceeds towards a "stable democracy," though with "inevitable flaws," such as those already mentioned.

<P>In July 1989 the State Department submitted a report entitled "Justification for Determination to Authorize Export-Import Act Guarantees and Insurance for Sales of Military Equipment to Colombia for Antinarcotics Purposes," the official cover story. The report states: "Colombia has a democratic form of government and does not exhibit a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights." Three months later, the UN Special Rapporteur on Summary Executions, Amos Wako, returned from a visit to Colombia with severe warnings about the extreme violence of the paramilitary forces in coordination with drug lords and government security forces: "There are currently over 140 paramilitary groups operating in Colombia today [which are] trained and financed by drug traffickers and possibly a few landowners. They operate very closely with elements in the armed forces and the police. Most of the killings and massacres carried out by the paramilitary groups occur in areas which are heavily militarized [where] they are able to move easily...and commit murders with impunity. In some cases, the military or police either turn a blind eye to what is being done by paramilitary groups or give suport by offering safe conduct passes to members of the paramilitary or by impeding investigation." His mandate did not extend to the direct terror of the security forces, which far outweighs the depredations of its informal allies.

<P>A few months before the State Department praise for Colombia's humane democracy, a Jesuit-sponsored development and research organization published a report documenting atrocities in the first part of 1988, including over 3000 politically-motivated killings, 273 in "social cleansing" campaigns.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT38" HREF="#FN38">38</A></FONT></SUP> Excluding those killed in combat, political killings averaged 8 a day, with seven murdered in their homes or in the street and one "disappeared." "The vast majority of those who have disappeared in recent years," WOLA added, "are grassroots organizers, peasant or union leaders, leftist politicians, human rights workers and other activists," over 1500 by the time of the State Department endorsement. Perhaps the State Department had in mind the recent (1988) mayoral campaigns, in which 29 of the 87 mayoral candidates of the UP were assassinated along with over 100 of its candidates for municipal councilor. The Central Organization of Workers, a coalition of trade unions formed in 1986, had by then lost over 230 members, most of them found dead after brutal torture.

<P>Recall also that in 1988, the more advanced forms of "maximal criminalization of the political and social opposition" were instituted for "total war against the internal enemy," as the regime of state terror consolidated. By the time the State Department report appeared, the methods of control it found praiseworthy were being still more systematically implemented. From 1988 through early 1992, 9500 people were assassinated for political reasons along with 830 disappearances and 313 massacres (between 1988 and 1990) of peasants and poor people.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT39" HREF="#FN39">39</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The primary victims of atrocities were, as usual, the poor, mainly peasants. In one southern department, grassroots organizations testified in February 1988 that a "campaign of total annihilation and scorched earth, Vietnam-style," was being conducted by the military forces "in a most criminal manner, with assassinations of men, women, elderly and children. Homes and crops are burned, obligating the peasants to leave their lands." The State Department had a plethora of evidence of this sort before it when it cleared Colombia of human rights violations. Its own official Human Rights reports attributed virtually all violence to the guerrillas and narcotraffickers, so that the US was "justified" in providing the mass murderers and torturers with military equipment, putting our taxes to good use.

<P>That, of course, was the "bad old days" of 1989, when we were still defending civilization from the Russian threat. Moving to the present, matters become worse, for reasons explained by President Gaviria in May 1992. When questioned about atrocities by the military in the Colombian press, he responded that "The battle against the guerrillas must be waged on unequal terms. The defense of human rights, of democratic principles, of the separation of powers, could prove to be an obstacle for the counterinsurgency struggle."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT40" HREF="#FN40">40</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>During the Bush years, the US Embassy "did not make a single public statement urging the government to curb political or military abuses," WOLA observes, while US support for the military and police increased.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT41" HREF="#FN41">41</A></FONT></SUP> But now that liberal Democrats have taken over, the Clinton Administration has called for a change in policy towards the Colombian killers: more active US participation. For fiscal year 1994, the Administration requested that military financing and training funds be <I>increased</I> by over 12%, reaching about half of proposed military aid for all of Latin America. Congressional budget cuts for the Pentagon interfered with these plans, so the Administration "intends to use emergency drawdown authority to bolster the Colombia account," Americas Watch reports. Congress, however, is continuing to interfere, taking note of "continuing human rights abuses on a large scale" and imposing conditions on US aid, which the Administration will have to find ways to evade, with the usual formulas and devices. The Senate also urged the Colombian Government to permit Red Cross access to police and detention facilities, which it has generally denied.

<P>The Human Rights organizations (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch) are committed to international conventions on human rights. Thus AI reports open by stating that the organization "works to promote all the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international standards." In practice, however, the commitment is skewed in accord with Western standards, which are significantly different. The United States, in particular, rejects the universality of the Universal Declaration, amidst much posturing about our noble defense of the sacred principle of universality and self-righteous denunciation of the "cultural relativism" of the backward peoples who fall short of our exalted standards. The United States has always flatly rejected the sections of the Universal Declaration dealing with social and economic rights, and also consistently disregards, ignores, and violates much of the remainder of the Declaration -- even putting aside its massive involvement in terror, torture, and other abuses.

<P>The Human Rights Groups say little about social and economic rights, generally adopting the highly biased Western perspective on these matters. In the case of Colombia, we have to go beyond these (in themselves, very valuable) reports to discover the roots of the extraordinary violence. They are not obscure. The president of the Colombian Permanent Committee for Human Rights, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfredo V squez Carrizosa, writes that it is "poverty and insufficient land reform" that "have made Colombia one of the most tragic countries of Latin America," and are the source of the violence, including the mass killings of the 1940s and early 1950s, which took hundreds of thousands of lives. Land reform was legislated in 1961, but "has practically been a myth," unimplemented because landowners "have had the power to stop it" in this admirable democracy with its constitutional regime, which V squez Carrizosa dismisses as a "facade," granting rights that have no relation to reality. The violence has been caused "by the dual structure of a prosperous minority and an impoverished, excluded majority, with great differences in wealth, income, and access to political participation."

<P>And as elsewhere in Latin America, "violence has been exacerbated by external factors," primarily the initiatives of the Kennedy Administration, which "took great pains to transform our regular armies into counterinsurgency brigades, accepting the new strategy of the death squads," ushering in "what is known in Latin America as the National Security Doctrine,...not defense against an external enemy, but a way to make the military establishment the masters of the game...[with] the right to combat the internal enemy, as set forth in the Brazilian doctrine, the Argentine doctrine, the Uruguayan doctrine, and the Colombian doctrine: it is the right to fight and to exterminate social workers, trade unionists, men and women who are not supportive of the establishment, and who are assumed to be communist extremists."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT42" HREF="#FN42">42</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It is in this precise sense, no other, that the Cold War guided our policies.

<P>The results are an income distribution that is "dramatically skewed," WOLA observes, another striking feature of the domains of longstanding US influence, from which we are, again, to learn nothing. The top three percent of Colombia's landed elite own over 70% of arable land, while 57% of the poorest farmers subsist on under 3%. 40% of Colombians live in "absolute poverty," unable to satisfy basic subsistence needs, according to a 1986 report of the National Administration Bureau of Statistics, while 18% live in "absolute misery," unable to meet nutritional needs. The Colombian Institute of Family Welfare estimates that four and a half million children under 14 are hungry: that is, one of every two children, in this triumph of capitalism, a country of enormous resources and potential, lauded as "one of the healthiest and most flourishing economies in Latin America" (Martz).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT43" HREF="#FN43">43</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The "stable democracy" does exist, but as what Jenny Pearce calls "democracy without the people," the majority of whom are excluded from the political system monopolized by elites, more so as political space has been "rapidly closing by the mid-1980s." For Colombian elites, the international funding agencies, and foreign investors, "democracy" functions. But it is not intended for the public generally, who are "marginalized economically and politically." "The state has reserved for the majority the `state of siege' and all the exceptional repressive legislation and procedures that can guarantee order where other mechanisms fail," Pearce continues, increasingly in recent years. That is democracy, in exactly the sense of regular practice and even doctrine, if we attend closely.

<P>No discussion of "democracy enhancement" in the current era can fail to consider Haiti, a sickening story that requires separate treatment, particularly now, when Clinton Administration efforts to undermine Haitian democracy have reached such a sordid level that even his allies are deserting the ship. As of March, the latest revelation of Clintonite deceit on "restoring democracy" to Haiti was the Congressional testimony of Lawrence Pezzullo, the Secretary of State's special adviser for Haiti. Pezzullo was questioned about a plan "portrayed as a Haitian solution spawned by weeks of tough negotiations in Washington among disparate leaders of Haitian society," Christopher Marquis reported in the <CITE>Miami Herald.</CITE> The Clinton Administration had strongly supported the plan as the optimal solution, representing Haitian democrats. It harshly condemned Aristide for his intransigence in rejecting the plan -- which, true enough, ignored such minor matters as the return of the elected President to Haiti and the removal of the worst of the state terrorists from power. Pezzullo conceded that the plan had in fact been "spawned" in the offices of the State Department, which selected the "Haitian negotiators" who were to ratify it in Washington. Included among them were right-wing extremists with close military ties, notably Frantz-Robert Mond, a former member of Duvalier's terrorist Tontons Macoute and a close associate of police chief Lt.-Col. Joseph Michel Francois, the most brutal and powerful of the Haitian state terrorists (incidentally, another beneficiary of US training).

<P>"In other words, the operation was a hoax" (Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs), yet another effort to ensure that democracy is "enhanced" in Haiti in the familiar way -- without any "populist-based change" that might upset "established economic and political orders" and open "a leftist direction" (Carothers).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT44" HREF="#FN44">44</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>I'll save until next time the Haitian illustration of the "romantic age" to which we have led suffering humanity.

<H1>Part II: The Case of Haiti</H1>

<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> July/August 1994
</CENTER>


<P>As discussed in Part I, the Reagan-Bush Administrations reluctantly adopted "prodemocracy policies as a means of relieving pressure for more radical change," and "inevitably sought only limited, top-down forms of democratic change that did not risk upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied" (Thomas Carothers of the Reagan State Department). The leading idea is revealed in the documents of USAID's democracy project, which stress that the U.S. supports "processes of democratic institutional reform that will further economic liberalization objectives" -- that is, entrenchment of the service role.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The reference to "the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied" has to undergo the usual translation. The phrase "United States" refers to the "traditional structures of power" at home. This is among the elementary truths that are to remain unspoken, along with the fact that the policies for the service areas merely adapt a conception of democracy that is to apply to the home societies as well. Here the general public "must be put in its place," as Walter Lippmann explained in his progressive essays on democracy long ago. The "ignorant and meddlesome outsiders" are to be only "interested spectators of action," not "participants." Their sole "function" in a democracy is to choose periodically among the leadership class (elections). Also unspoken is the fact that the "responsible men" who manage the democratic society gain that status by virtue of their service to "the traditional structures of power." There is a very broad consensus in the intellectual community, and of course the business world, that the "ignorant and incapable mass of humanity" must not be allowed to disrupt policy formation (Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of State Robert Lansing), that planners must be "insulated" from politics, in World Bank lingo.

<P>The "prodemocracy policies" in the service areas long antedate the Reaganites, and have little to do with the Cold War, apart from ideological cover. Accordingly, they should be expected to persist, as they do. Among the cases reviewed in Part I, the most striking is Colombia, which has become the leading human rights violator in the hemisphere and the recipient of more than half of total U.S. military aid and training, sent on its way with the usual acclaim for Colombia's democratic achievements as state terror mounts -- all rising to new heights under Clinton.

<P>"Human Rights enhancement" marches on in parallel. In Part I, I reviewed Clinton's steps to evade congressional efforts to impose human rights conditions on military aid and trade privileges for Indonesia and China, and the concept of "human rights" itself, crafted to evade atrocities that contribute to profit. In the weeks since, the China story took its predictable course. "President Clinton's decision to renew China's trade benefits was the culmination of a titanic clash between America's global economic interests and its self-image as the world's leading advocate of human rights," Thomas Friedman's lead article opened in the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> reporting the surprising outcome. Clinton did not merely endorse the Bush Administration policies that he had caustically denounced during the presidential campaign, but went well beyond them, deciding "to delink human rights" completely from trade privileges.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Indonesia case sheds further light on the "titanic clash." As discussed in Part I, Clinton joined his predecessors and colleagues abroad in ensuring the welfare of the Indonesian tyrants and murderers and the foreign corporations that benefit from their rule, blocking and evading congressional restrictions on military assistance. The issue was quite narrow: whether to refrain from direct participation in Indonesian atrocities at home and abroad. There was no thought of proceeding beyond, to some action to deter some of the worst crimes of the modern era.

<P>The review in Part I was perhaps unfair in not mentioning that world leaders do recognize some limits, and have indeed considered sanctions against Indonesia. In November 1993, on behalf of the nonaligned movement and the World Health Organization (WHO), Indonesia submitted to the UN a resolution requesting an opinion from the World Court on the legality of the use of nuclear weapons. In the face of this atrocity, the guardians of international morality leaped into action. The U.S., U.K., and France threatened Indonesia with trade sanctions and termination of aid unless it withdrew the resolution, as it did. Traditional clients understand very well when a message from the powerful is to be heeded.

<P>Citizens of the free world were again fortunate to have the information readily available to them; in this case, in the Catholic Church press in Canada.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Freedom of information can go only so far, however. On June 10, the World Court was scheduled to take up the WHO request for an opinion, despite a furious campaign by the U.S., U.K., and their allies to prevent this outrage. The matter is of some importance. Even consideration of the issue by the Court would be a contribution to the cause of nonproliferation; even more so a decision that use of nuclear weapons is a crime under international law -- hence by implication, possession as well. As of mid-June, I have found no word on the matter, though the nonproliferation treaty is a topic of lead headlines, particularly the threat posed to its renewal in 1995 by North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program.

<P>I barely mentioned one of the clearest tests of the Clinton vision on "democracy enhancement": Haiti. The case serves well to illustrate the "prodemocracy policies" of the Reagan-Bush years, as Carothers accurately describes them. We may ask, then, how things changed as the New Democrats took command.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<H3>1. The Legacy of History</H3>

<P>Even the briefest glimpse of Haiti's torment leaves impressions that do not easily fade, beginning with the scene of desolation on approaching the international airport. It is hard to remember that through the 18th century the island was the richest and most profitable of the Western colonies, and like today's Bangladesh, had struck the European conquerors as a virtual paradise. The Presidential Palace in Port-au-Prince, dominating a large square, is flanked by the headquarters of the military command and, at a slight remove, the equally-dreaded police. The symbols of authority and violence stand in impudent mockery of the misery that lies below them -- "confirming the permanence of power, a reminder to the people of their smallness in regard to the state, a reminder to the executioners of the omnipotence of their chief," in the worlds of Haitian anthropologist Michel-Rolph Trouillot, expressing the logic of the Duvalierists, Papa Doc and Baby Doc, who ruled with brutal violence for 30 years.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In the markets and slums below, it is barely possible to make one's way down alleys of mud and filth through teeming masses of people clad in rags. Women struggle past with huge burdens on their heads, children try to sell any miserable object, an occasional cart is dragged through mud that is inches deep and puddles left by recent rains. Flies swarm over a handful of vegetables and what might pass for fish. Peasants who have trudged down from the mountains on ancient trails sit by their paltry offerings, sleeping in the relics of shacks that line the alleys. In the depths of Third World poverty, one rarely finds a scene so noxious and depressing.

<P>When I visited briefly a year ago, before the renewed terror, some people in the marketplace were willing to speak in the presence of a translator who was known and trusted, but only in circumlocution. The eyes of the security forces are everywhere, they intimated by their gestures more than their words. These were uniform: hunger, no work, no hope -- unless, somehow, President Aristide returns, though few dare to articulate the phrase beyond hints and nods. Some do, with remarkable courage, even after police torture and the threat of worse. It is not easy to believe that such courage can long survive, even if the people do.

<P>U.S. relations with Haiti are not a thing of yesterday, and show no sign of fundamental change. They go back 200 years, to the days when the Republic that had just won its independence from Britain joined the imperial powers in their campaign to quell Haiti's slave rebellion by violence. When the rebellion nevertheless succeeded, the U.S. exceeded all others in the harshness of its reaction, refusing to recognize Haiti until 1862, in the context of the American civil war. At that moment, Haiti was important for its strategic location and as a possible dumping ground for freed slaves; Liberia was recognized in the same year, for the same reasons. Haiti then became a plaything for U.S.-European power politics, with numerous U.S. interventions culminating in Woodrow Wilson's invasion of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where his warriors -- as viciously racist as the Administration in Washington -- murdered and destroyed, reinstituted virtual slavery, dismantled the constitutional system because the backward Haitians could not see the merits of turning their country into a U.S. plantation, and established the National Guards that held both countries in their grip after the Marines finally left.

<P>Wilson's thuggery has entered history in two different versions: here and there. In the U.S., the events figure in the amusing reconstructions entitled "history" as an illustration of U.S. "humanitarian intervention" and its difficulties (for us). Haitians have somewhat different memories. "Most observers agree that the achievements of the occupation were minor; they disagree only as to the amount of damage it inflicted," Trouillot writes under the heading "unhealed sores." The damage included the acceleration of Haiti's economic, military, and political centralization, its economic dependence and sharp class divisions, the vicious exploitation of the peasantry, the internal racial conflicts much intensified by the extreme racism of the occupying forces, and perhaps worst of all, the establishment of "an army to fight the people." "The 1915-1934 U.S. occupation of Haiti," he writes, "left the country with two poisoned gifts: a weaker civil society and a solidified state apparatus.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A year ago, after enduring almost two years of renewed state violence, grassroots organizations, priests in hiding, tortured labor leaders, and others suffering bitterly from the violence of the security forces expressed marked opposition to the plan to dispatch 500 UN police to the terrorized country, seeing them as a cover for a U.S. intervention that evokes bitter memories of the Marine occupation. If ever noted, such reactions may be attributed to the fact that "even a benevolent occupation creates resistance...among the beneficiaries" (Harvard historian David Landes, writing about the Marine occupation). Or to the deficiencies of people who need only a new culture and more kind tutelage of the kind he provided as director of the USAID mission in 1977-79, Lawrence Harrison writes in a "think piece" on Haiti's problems in which the U.S. military occupation merits only the words: "And some of the Marines abused their power."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Poor and suffering people do not have the luxury of indulging in fairy tales. Not uncommonly, their own experience gives them a grasp of realities that are well concealed by the intellectual culture. The usual victims can not so easily dismiss the record of U.S. power, which leaves little doubt that U.S. military intervention in Haiti would be the death knell for any form of democracy that "risks upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied." Haitians who have lost all hope for restoration of democracy might support a military intervention that could, perhaps, reduce terror and torture. But that is the most that can be realistically expected.

<P>The military occupation left the island under U.S. control and largely U.S.-owned. The killer and torturer Trujillo took over the Dominican Republic, remaining a great friend until he began to get out of hand in the 1950s. In Haiti, Washington reacted with some ambivalence to the murderous and brutal dictatorship of "Papa Doc" Francois Duvalier, finding him a bit too independent for its taste. Nevertheless, Kennedy provided him with military assistance, in line with his general program of establishing firm U.S. control over the hemisphere's military and police as they undertook the task of "internal security" that he assigned them in a historic 1962 decision. Kennedy also provided aid for the Francois Duvalier International Airport in exchange for the Haitian vote to expel Cuba from the OAS. When "Baby Doc" Jean-Claude took over in 1971, relations rapidly improved, and Haiti became another "darling" of the business community, along with Brazil under the neo-Nazi generals and other right-thinking folk. USAID undertook to turn Haiti into the "Taiwan of the Caribbean," forecasting "a historic change toward deeper market interdependence with the United States," Trouillot observes. U.S. taxpayers funded projects to establish assembly plants that would exploit such advantages as enormous unemployment (thanks in part to USAID policies emphasizing agroexport) and a workforce -- mainly women, as elsewhere considered more docile -- with wages of 14 cents an hour, no unions, ample terror, and the other usual amenities. The consequences were profits for U.S. corporations and their Haitian associates, and a decline of 56% in wages in the 1980s. In short, if not Taiwan exactly, Haiti was an "economic miracle" of the usual sort.

<P>Haiti offered the Reaganites yet another opportunity to reveal their understanding of democracy enhancement in June 1985, when its legislature unanimously adopted a new law requiring that every political party must recognize President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier as the supreme arbiter of the nation, outlawing the Christian Democrats, and granting the government the right to suspend the rights of any party without reasons. The law was ratified by a majority of 99.98%. Washington was deeply impressed, as much so as it was when Mussolini won 99% of the vote in the March 1934 election, leading Roosevelt's State Department to conclude that the results "demonstrate incontestably the popularity of the Fascist regime" and of "that admirable Italian gentleman" who ran it, as Roosevelt described the dictator. These are among the many interesting facts that might be recalled as neo-Fascists now take their place openly in the political system that was reconstructed with their interests in mind as Italy was liberated by American forces 50 years ago. Curiously, all this escaped attention during the D-Day anniversary extravaganza, along with much else that is too enlightening.

<P>The 1985 steps to enhance democracy in Haiti were "an encouraging step forward," the U.S. Ambassador informed his guests at a July 4 celebration. The Reagan Administration certified to Congress that "democratic development" was progressing, so that military and economic aid could continue to flow -- mainly into the pockets of Baby Doc and his entourage. It also informed Congress that the human rights situation was improving, as it was at the time in El Salvador and Guatemala, and today in Colombia, and quite generally when some client regime requires military aid for "internal security." The House Foreign Affairs Committee, controlled by Democrats, had given its approval in advance, calling on Reagan "to maintain friendly relations with Duvalier's non-Communist government."

<P>To justify their perception of an "encouraging step forward" in "democratic development," the Reaganites could have recalled the vote held under Woodrow Wilson's rule after he had disbanded the Haitian parliament in punishment for its refusal to turn Haiti over to American corporations under a new U.S.-designed Constitution. Wilson's Marines organized a plebiscite in which the Constitution was ratified by a 99.9% vote, with 5% of the population participating, using "rather high handed methods to get the Constitution adopted by the people of Haiti," the State Department conceded a decade later. Baby Doc, in contrast, allowed a much broader franchise, though it is true that he demanded a slightly higher degree of acquiescence than Wilsonian idealists, Mussolini, and New Dealers. A case could be made, then, that the lessons in democracy that Washington had been laboring to impart were finally sinking in.

<P>These gratifying developments were short-lived, however. By December 1985, popular protests were straining the resources of state terror. What happened next was described by the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> with engaging frankness: after "huge demonstrations," the White House concluded "that the regime was unraveling" and that "Haiti's ruling inner circle had lost faith in" its favored democrat, Baby Doc. "As a result, U.S. officials, including Secretary of State George Shultz, began openly calling for a `democratic process' in Haiti." Small wonder that Shultz is so praised for his commitment to democracy and other noble traits.

<P>The meaning of this call for democracy was underscored by the scenario then unfolding in the Philippines, where the army and elite made it clear they would no longer support another gangster for whom Reagan and Bush had expressed their admiration, even "love," not long before, so that the White House "began openly calling for a `democratic process'" there as well. Both events accordingly enter the canon as a demonstration of how we "served as inspiration for the triumph of democracy in our time" in those wondrous years (<CITE>New Republic</CITE>).

<P>Washington lent its support to the post-Duvalier National Council of Government (CNG), providing $2.8 million in military aid in its first year, while the CNG, "generously helped by the U.S. taxpayer's money, had openly gunned down more civilians than Jean-Claude Duvalier's government had done in fifteen years" (Trouillot). After a series of coups and massacres, Reagan's Ambassador explained to Human Rights investigators that "I don't see any evidence of a policy against human rights"; there may be violence, it is true, but it is just "part of the culture." We can only watch in dismay and incomprehension.

<P>Haitian violence thus falls into the same category as the atrocities in El Salvador at the same time, for example, the massacre at El Mozote, one of the many conducted by U.S.-trained elite battalions -- and one of the few to be admitted to History, after exposure by the UN Truth Commission. Given their origins in U.S. planning, these routine atrocities must also be "part of the culture." Or perhaps "There is no one to blame except the gods of war," as Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> observed, reviewing the "fair-minded" account by Mark Danner which "aptly denotes" the "horrifying incident" as "a central parable of the cold war" for which blame is shared equally by Salvadorans on all sides, murderers and victims alike. In contrast, atrocities organized and directed by the Soviet Union always seemed to have more determinable origins, for some reason.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<H3>2. The Democratic Interlude</H3>

<P>Haiti's happy ascent towards Taiwan was deflected unexpectedly in December 1990, when a real problem arose, unlike the terror and virtual enslavement of workers that are just "part of the culture." Washington made a serious error, allowing a free election in expectation of an easy victory for its candidate, Marc Bazin, a former World Bank official. To the surprise of outside observers, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected with two-thirds of the vote (Bazin was second with 14%), backed by a popular movement, Lavalas, which had escaped the notice of the rich folk. Outside of properly educated circles, one question came to the fore at once: What would the U.S. and its clients do to remove this cancer?

<P>President Aristide held office from February to September, when his government was overthrown by a military coup, plunging the country into even deeper barbarism than before. There are two versions of what happened in the interim. One is given by various extremists who see Aristide as the representative of a "remarkably advanced" array of grass-roots organizations (Lavalas) that gave the large majority of the population a "considerable voice in local affairs" and even in national politics (Americas Watch); and who were impressed by Aristide's domestic policies as he "acted quickly to restore order to the government's finances" after taking power when "the economy was in an unprecedented state of disintegration" (Inter-American Development Bank). Other international lending agencies agreed, offering aid and endorsing Aristide's investment program. They were particularly impressed by the steps he took to reduce foreign debt and inflation, to raise foreign exchange reserves from near zero to $12 million, to increase government revenues with successful tax collection measures (reaching into the kleptocracy), to streamline the bloated government bureaucracy and eliminate fictitious positions in an anti-corruption campaign, to cut back contraband trade and improve customs, and to establish a responsible fiscal system.

<P>These actions were "welcomed by the international financial community," the IADB noted, leading to "a substantial increase in assistance." Atrocities and flight of refugees also virtually ended; indeed the refugee flow reversed, as Haitians began to return to their country in its moment of hope. The U.S. Embassy in Haiti secretly acknowledged the facts. In a February 1991 State Department cable, declassified in 1994, the number two person in the Embassy, Vicky Huddleston, reported to Washington on "the surprisingly successful efforts of the Aristide government,...quickly reversed after the coup" (reported by Dennis Bernstein for Pacific News Service).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Sophisticates in Washington and New York could understand that all of this is illusion. As Secretary of State Lansing had explained: "The experience of Liberia and Haiti show that the African race are devoid of any capacity for political organization and lack genius for government. Unquestionably there is an inherent tendency to revert to savagery and to cast aside the shackles of civilization which are irksome to their physical nature. Of course, there are many exceptions to this racial weakness, but it is true of the mass, as we know from experience in this country. It is that which makes the negro problem practically unsolvable."

<P>A more acceptable version of Aristide's months in offices is offered by <CITE>New York Times</CITE> Haiti correspondent Howard French. He reported after the coup that Aristide had governed "with the aid of fear," leaning "heavily on Lavalas, an unstructured movement of affluent idealists and long-exiled leftists" whose model was China's Cultural Revolution. Aristide's power hunger led to "troubles with civil society." Furthermore, "Haitian political leaders and diplomats say, the growing climate of vigilantism as well as increasingly strident statements by Father Aristide blaming the wealthier classes for the poverty of the masses encouraged" the coup. "Although he retains much of the popular support that enabled him to win 67% of the popular vote in the country's December 1990 elections, Father Aristide was overthrown in part because of concerns among politically active people over his commitment to the Constitution, and growing fears of political and class-based violence, which many believe the President endorsed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Relation to fact aside, the analysis provides some lessons in Political Correctness. Two-thirds of the population and their organizations fall outside of "civil society." Those involved in the popular organizations and in local and national politics are not among the "politically active people." It is scandalous to tell the plain truth about the responsibility of the kleptocracy for "the poverty of the masses." "Fears of political and class-based violence" are limited to the months when such violence sharply declined, its traditional perpetrators being unable, temporarily, to pursue their vocation.

<P>These lessons should be remembered as Washington moves to construct a "civil society" and "democratic political order" for this "failed state" with its degenerate culture and people, quite incapable of governing themselves.

<P>In reality, the two versions of what happened during the democratic interlude are closer than it may seem on the surface. The "remarkably advanced" array of popular organizations that brought the large majority of the population into the political arena is precisely what frightened Washington and the mainstream generally. They have a different understanding of "democracy" and "civil society," one that offers no place to popular organizations that allow the overwhelming majority a voice in managing their own affairs. By definition, the "political leaders" of such popular organizations have only "meager" democratic credentials, and can therefore be granted only symbolic participation in the "democratic institutions" that we will construct in accord with our traditional "prodemocracy policies." So the government and media have been instructing us since the coup removed the radical extremist Aristide and his Maoist clique.

<P>These simple truths account for much of what has happened in Haiti since Aristide's election. Trouillot concludes his study by observing that "In Haiti, the peasantry is the nation." But for policymakers, the peasantry are worthless objects except insofar as they can advance corporate profits. They may produce food for export and enrich local affiliates of U.S. agribusiness, or flock to the city to provide super-cheap labor for assembly plants, but they have no further function. It is therefore entirely natural that USAID, while providing $100 million in assistance to the private sector, should never have provided a penny to the leading popular peasant organization, the Peasant Movement of Papaye (MPP); and that former USAID director Harrison should see no special problem when MPP members are massacred by the military forces and should dismiss with contempt its call for moves to reinstitute the popularly elected President who was committed to "bottom-up" rather than "top-down" democracy.

<P>Similarly, it is hardly surprising that USAID should have denounced the labor reforms Aristide sought to institute and opposed his efforts to raise the minimum wage to a princely 37 cents an hour. Nor should we find it odd that USAID invested massively in the low wage assembly sector while wages sharply declined and working conditions fell to abysmal levels, but terminated all efforts to promote investment as the democratically elected government took office. Rather, USAID reacted to this catastrophe by dedicating itself still more firmly to providing the Haitian business community with what it called "technical assistance in labor relations, development of a business oriented public relations campaign, and intensified efforts to attract U.S. products assembly operations to Haiti." Given the unfortunate democratic deviation, USAID's task, in its own words, was to "work to develop sustainable dialogue between the government and the business community"; no comparable efforts for workers and peasants were needed when Haiti was run by U.S.-backed killers and torturers. All of this conforms well to USAID's conception of "processes of democratic institutional reform" as those that "further economic liberalization objectives.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Similarly, there is no reason to be surprised that U.S. elites suddenly began to show a sensitive concern for human rights and democracy just as human rights violations precipitously declined and democracy (though not in the preferred "top-down" sense) began to flourish. Amy Wilentz observes that during Aristide's brief term, Washington suddenly became concerned with "human rights and the rule of law in Haiti." "During the four regimes that preceded Aristide," she writes, "international human-rights advocates and democratic observers had begged the State Department to consider helping the democratic opposition in Haiti. But no steps were taken by the United States to strengthen anything but the executive and the military until Aristide won the presidency. Then, all of a sudden, the United States began to think about how it could help those Haitians eager to limit the powers of the executive or to replace the government constitutionally." The State Department "Democracy Enhancement" project was "specifically designed to fund those sectors of the Haitian political spectrum where opposition to the Aristide government could be encouraged," precisely as "prodemocracy policies" dictate. The institutions and leaders that merited such support are just the ones that survived the military coup, also no surprise.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<H3>3. After the Coup</H3>

<P>Wilentz reports further that immediately after the September 30 coup, the State Department apparently "circulated a thick notebook filled with alleged human rights violations" under Aristide -- "something it had not done under the previous rulers, Duvalierists and military men," who were deemed proper recipients for aid, including military aid, "based on unsubstantiated human-rights improvements." <CITE>Toronto Star</CITE> reporter Linda Diebel adds details. A "thick, bound dossier" on Aristide's alleged crimes was presented by the coup leader, General Cedras, to OAS negotiators. On October 3, U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams summoned reporters from the <CITE>New York Times, Washington Post,</CITE> and other major U.S. journals to private meetings where he briefed them on these alleged crimes, reportedly presenting them with the "dossier" -- which, we may learn some day, was compiled by U.S. intelligence and provided to its favorite generals. The Ambassador and his helpers began leaking the tales that have been used since to demonstrate Aristide's meager democratic credentials and his psychological disorders.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The approved version is reflected by coverage of human rights abuses after the coup. As shown in a study by Boston Media Action, while the military were rampaging, the press focussed on abuses attributed to Aristide supporters, less than 1% of the total but the topic of 60% of the coverage in major journals during the two weeks following the coup, and over half of coverage in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> through mid-1992. During the two-week period after the coup, Catherine Orenstein reports, the <CITE>Times</CITE> "spent over three times as many column inches discussing Aristide's alleged transgressions [as] it spent reporting on the ongoing military repression. Mass murders, executions, and tortures that were reported in human rights publications earned less than 4% of the space that the <CITE>Times</CITE> devoted to Haiti in those weeks." A week after the coup, the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> accused Aristide of having organized his followers into "an instrument of real terror," ignoring the 75% reduction in human rights abuses during his term reported by human rights groups.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>While attention was directed to the really important topic of the "class-based violence" of Aristide and the popular movements, the U.S.-trained military and police were conducting their reign of terror, "ruthlessly suppressing Haiti's once diverse and vibrant civil society," Americas Watch reported. Though "Washington's capacity to curb attacks on civil society was tremendous, this power was largely unexercised by the Bush administration," which "sought to convey an image of normalcy" while forcefully returning refugees. The terror is functional: it ensures that even if Aristide is permitted to return, "he would have difficulty transforming his personal popularity into the organized support needed to exert civilian authority," Americas Watch observed in early 1993, quoting priests and others who feared that the destruction of the popular social organizations that "gave people hope" had already undermined the great promise of Haiti's first democratic experiment.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The coup and ensuing terror revived the flow of refugees that had lapsed under Aristide. The Bush Administration ordered the Coast Guard and Navy to force them back, or to imprison them in the U.S. military base in Guantanamo until a court order terminated the shocking practices there. During the presidential campaign, Clinton bitterly condemned these cruel policies. On taking over in January 1993, he at once tightened the noose, imposing a still harsher blockade. Forceful return of refugees continued in violation of international law and human rights conventions. Clinton's increased brutality proved to be a grand success. Refugee flow, which had reached over 30,000 in 1992, sharply declined under Clinton's ministrations, to about the level of 1989, before the sharp decline under Aristide.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The official story is that these are "economic refugees," not victims of political persecution who would be eligible for asylum. The onset of poverty can be quite precisely dated: to the date of the coup. During Aristide's term, refugee flow was slight, skyrocketing after the coup though economic sanctions were minimal. These oddities are noted by the indispensable journal <CITE>Haiti Info</CITE> published in Port-au-Prince, in a discussion of a cable circulated to high officials by U.S. Ambassador William Swing. The 11-page cable, full of racist slanders, alleges that "the Haitian left manipulates and fabricates human rights abuses as a propaganda tool" and is "wittingly or unwittingly assisted in this effort" by human rights organizations and the civilian monitors of the UN and OAS missions; all "comsymps" in the terminology of an earlier day. The Embassy dismissed with a sneer the reports of "the sudden epidemic of rapes" on the grounds that "For a range of cultural reasons (not pleasant to contemplate), rape has never been considered or reported as a serious crime here." The testimony of a man that his wife was raped and that he was badly beaten under police custody, corroborated by a foreign nurse, is dismissed because he chose asylum in Canada (granted at once), avoiding the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) -- a transparent admission of iniquity. Clinton's Embassy attributes problems in Haiti to "a high level of structural, or endemic, violence," which, again, is just "part of the culture." Like the poverty that causes refugee flight, the "structural" factors causing violence had an unexplained 8-month gap: during Aristide's tenure even his most vehement opponents, the USAID-supported "human rights" advocates who moved quickly into power after the coup, could compile only 25 cases of "mob violence" and four crimes that could be considered political, a tiny fraction of the terror before, not to speak of the atrocities that followed the coup.

<P>Kenneth Roth, the director of Human Rights Watch, comments that the cable reveals the "extreme antipathy for Aristide" in the Embassy and its "willingness to play down human rights abuses to prevent a political momentum to build for [Aristide's] return." It "reflects a dislike and distrust of Aristide that has been widely felt in the Administration -- though voiced only privately," <CITE>Times</CITE> correspondent Elaine Sciolino adds. In reality, the dislike is quite public and widely reported, along with the fact that it has sent a very clear message to the Haitian rulers, military and civilian.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As the Embassy cable was released, an experienced INS asylum officer in Haiti went public with his charges that thousands of "egregious cases of persecution" were rejected by the Haitian INS office, where the "entire process" of asylum review "had been politicized" and under 1% of legitimate petitions were accepted by racist and contemptuous officials; similar accounts have been documented by human rights organizations, who have also denounced the very idea that petitioners should have to identify themselves to the murderers by appearing at the INS office. At the same time, a "Top Secret" memo of the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba was leaked. Addressed to the Secretary of State, the CIA, and the INS, the document complains about the lack of genuine claims of political persecution in Cuba, contrary to policy needs. The usual silence prevailed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Meanwhile refugees from Cuba receive royal treatment while Haitians are returned to terror. That is nothing new. Of the more than 24,000 Haitians intercepted by U.S. forces from 1981 to Aristide's takeover in 1991, 11 were granted asylum as victims of political persecution, in comparison with 75,000 out of 75,000 Cubans. In these years of terror, Washington allowed 28 asylum claims. During Aristide's tenure, with violence and repression radically reduced, 20 were allowed from a refugee pool perhaps 1/50th the scale. Practice returned to normal after the military coup and the renewed terror. As always, human rights are understood in purely instrumental terms: as a weapon to be selectively deployed for power interests, nothing more.

<P>The democratically elected President will be acceptable to Washington and elite opinion generally only if he abandons his popular mandate, ceding effective power to the "moderates" in the business world. The "moderates" are those who do not favor slaughter and mutilation, preferring to see the population driven to agroexport and the low-wage assembly sector. They constitute "civil society," in the technical sense. Since the coup, the U.S. has demanded that Aristide agree to "broaden the government" in such a way as to place the "moderates" in power. Insofar as he refuses to transfer power into these proper hands, he is an "extremist" whom we can hardly support.

<P>While these are the basic terms of respectable discourse, the spectrum is not entirely uniform. It ranges from the far right, which is honest and outspoken in its call for dismantling Haitian democracy, to the more nuanced versions of the liberal Democrats. Taking a stand in the middle, George Bush calls for abandoning Aristide because "he has become unreliable" and even "turned on our president the other day" (May 1994). Aristide should be dumped because his "undemocratic behavior...included fostering violence against his opponents," according to another noted pacifist who has distinguished himself particularly for his dedication to legality and democratic principle (Elliott Abrams).

<P>Moving toward the liberal end, a Clinton official explained in the last days of 1993 that "We're not talking about dumping Aristide or about military power-sharing. But we have two adversaries who don't want to compromise and we have to find enough of a middle to make a functioning democracy," marginalizing the extremists on both sides. The elected President should be "restored to power, at least nominally," World Peace Foundation president and historian Robert Rotberg added; but also at most nominally, as all understand. The Washington director of the Inter-American Dialogue, Peter Hakim, urged in May 1994 that "the US ought to separate out the notion of protecting human rights, and reestablishing some semblance of society in Haiti, from restoring Aristide to power." "So it is only honest for the United States to tell Father Aristide that he has little hope of returning to power without making large political compromises," as the <CITE>Times</CITE> editors phrased the common understanding a few weeks later. In short, the traditional "prodemocracy policies."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></FONT></SUP>
 
The basic idea was outlined by Secretary of State Warren Christopher during his confirmation hearings. Christopher "expressed support for Father Aristide," Elaine Sciolino reported, "but stopped short of calling for his reinstatement as President. `There is no question in my mind that because of the election, he has to be part of the solution to this,' Mr. Christopher said. `I don't have a precise system worked out in my mind as to how he would be part of the solution, but certainly he cannot be ignored in the matter'.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></FONT></SUP>
 With this ringing endorsement of democracy, the Clinton Administration took charge.

<P>Across the spectrum, it is taken for granted that we have both the right and the competence to "establish some semblance of society" in Haiti, whose people are so retrograde as to have developed a "remarkably advanced" array of grass-roots organizations that gave the majority of the population a place in the public arena. Plainly, they desperately need our tutelage.

<H3>4. The Clinton Compromise</H3>

<P>To much acclaim, Washington finally succeeded in compelling Aristide to transfer authority to the "moderates." Under severe pressure, in July 1993 the Haitian President accepted the U.S.-UN terms for settlement, which were to allow him to return four months later in a "compromise" with the gangsters and killers. He agreed to appoint as Prime Minister a businessman from the traditional mulatto elite, Robert Malval, who is "known to be opposed to the populist policies during Aristide's seven months in power," the press announced with relief, noting that he is "generally well regarded by the business community," "respected by many businessmen who supported the coup that ousted the President," and seen as "a reassuring choice" by coup-supporters.

<P>Shortly after these happy developments took place, UN/OAS observers reported, with little notice, that they were "very concerned that there is no perceptible lessening of human rights violations," and a few weeks later, reported an increase in "arbitrary executions and suspicious deaths" in the weeks following the UN-brokered accord, over one a day in the Port-au-Prince area alone; "the mission said that many of the victims were members of popular organizations and neighborhood associations and that some of the killers were police," wire services reported.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Expected to be a transitional figure, Malval resigned at the year's end. His presence did, however, serve a useful role for Washington and its media, diverting attention to a "political settlement" while attacks on the popular organizations and general terror mounted, Aristide's promised return was blocked, and new initiatives were put forth to transfer power to traditional power centers ("broadening the government"). Malval's presence also offered the press a great method to bring out Aristide's unreasonable intransigence. He couldn't even come to terms with "his handpicked Prime Minister," a phrase that ritually accompanied the name "Robert Malval." In a typical exercise, Howard French opened a report of Malval's resignation by writing: "Three days after formally resigning, the handpicked Prime Minister of Haiti's exiled President lashed out this weekend at the man who appointed him" -- hammering home the message in the fashion that became so routine as to be comical. Malval described Aristide as an "erratic figure" with a "serious ego problem," French continued, referring to his commitment to restore the democratically-elected government.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As the date for Aristide's scheduled October 30 return approached, atrocities mounted high enough to gain some attention, though no action. Amidst reports of "terrifying stories" of terror, murder, and threats to exterminate all members of the popular organizations, the Clinton Administration announced that the UN Mission "will rely on the Haitian military and police to maintain order" -- that is, on the killers. "It is not a peacekeeping role," Secretary of Defense Aspin explained: "We are doing something other than peacekeeping here." Meanwhile, the press emphasized the concerns of U.S. officials that Aristide "isn't moving strongly to restore democratic rights," from his exile in Washington. "Even as the situation has grown worse, foreign diplomats have increasingly blamed Father Aristide for what they say is his failure to take constructive initiatives," Howard French wrote, using the standard device to disguise propaganda as reporting.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The stage was set for ignoring the October deadline, as the U.S. stood helplessly by, unable to bring the uncompromising and violent extremists on both sides to accept "democracy."

<P>Reviewing these mid-1993 developments, Ian Martin, who directed the OAS/UN mission from April through December 1993, writes that one basic problem was U.S. insistence on adding "a mostly American military component to the negotiators' proposals." Aristide's call for reducing the Haitian army to 1000 men was rejected. "The Haitian high command, for its part, sought U.S. assistance to ensure the army's future." The generals trusted the U.S. and "mistrusted the U.N. and the proposal for the Canadians and French, both more committed supporters of Aristide than the United States, to take the lead in the police contingent. The U.S. hoped to preserve the military -- an institution it had often assisted and in fact had created for purposes of internal control during the American occupation of 1915-34." Haitian army "resistance was encouraged whenever they perceived that the United States, despite its rhetoric of democracy, was ambivalent about that power shift" to the popular elements represented by Aristide. There was no shortage of such occasions.

<P>The crucial signal, Martin and others agree, came on October 11, when the USS <CITE>Harlan County</CITE> was scheduled to disembark U.S. and Canadian troops at Port-au-Prince. The military organized "a hostile demonstration of armed thugs," Martin observes, and "instead of waiting in the harbor while the Haitian military was pressured to ensure a safe landing, the <CITE>Harlan County</CITE> turned tail for Guantanamo Bay," leaving officials of the UN/OAS mission "aghast"; they "had been neither consulted nor informed of the decision by President Bill Clinton's National Security Council to retreat." "The organizers of the Haitian protest could hardly believe their success," Martin continues. The leader of the paramilitary organization FRAPH, responsible for much of the terror, said that "My people kept wanting to run away, but I took the gamble and urged them to stay. Then the Americans pulled out! We were astonished. That was the day FRAPH was actually born. Before, everyone said we were crazy, suicidal, that we would all be burned if Aristide returned. But now we know he is never going to return." The military got the message too, loud and clear.

<P>Perhaps they were even notified in advance. <CITE>New York Daily News</CITE> correspondent Juan Gonzalez learned of the October 11 port demonstration the day before at a Duvalierist meeting attended by U.S. Embassy personnel. The following day, he asked in print: "How can two <CITE>Daily News</CITE> reporters who have only visited Haiti on a few occasions learn beforehand of secret plans to sabotage the landing of our troops, while our vaunted officialdom claims it was caught flat-footed?" How indeed.

<P>Another possible line of communication is suggested in a report by Father Antoine Adrien, former head of Aristide's religious order in Haiti and a close associate. Just before the ship "turned tail," he informed the Catholic Church press that Haitian military officers had not only attended training school in Fort Benning, Ga., in 1992, but that "some were there as recently as the previous week" -- October 1993. "How are you going to tell those people they have no backing in the United States?," Father Adrien asked. That Haitian army officers received training in the U.S. after the coup was confirmed in an internal Pentagon document, including eight officers who started courses in early 1992. The program they joined is designed to expose "future leaders of foreign defense establishments" to "American values, regard for human rights and democratic institutions," according to the Defense Secretary's report to the President for 1993. Earlier graduates include the leading killers in Haiti, Central America, and elsewhere.

<P>What lay behind the decision to turn tail was explained by Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Walter Slocombe, who "boasted at a cocktail party that by turning back the U.S.S. Harlan County, he had helped save the United States from a `small war'," the <CITE>Times</CITE> reported six months later: "He vowed that the Pentagon would not risk American soldiers' lives to put `that psychopath' back in power."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>While messages were coming through to the military, the Haitian people were deprived of the one voice they longed to hear. "Senior Clinton administration officials are embroiled in a fight over whether to allow...Aristide to broadcast into the junta-ruled country using airborne U.S. military transmitters," Paul Quinn-Judge reported in May 1994. The USIA is opposed, fearing that "the plan may violate international law," always a prime concern in Washington. USIA was also concerned that such broadcasts "would provide Aristide with an uncomfortably direct means to communicate with Haitians, who elected him by an overwhelming margin in 1990." His oratory has been known to "create problems," a classifed USIA memorandum of May 23 noted, asking whether "we wish to have the responsibility for having given him the means to broadcast whatever he chooses to Haiti." He might even challenge the U.S. publicly "the first time we refuse to air something." It wouldn't even suffice to have him submit his scripts in advance, because of the "highly nuanced language and context" of a radio broadcast; who knows what thoughts this devious creature might convey by his tone of voice? "Debate over the idea...underscores the continuing ambivalence and nervousness with which some senior officials view Aristide," Quinn-Judge observed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT25" HREF="#FN25">25</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>After the military coup, the OAS instituted a toothless embargo, which the Bush Administration reluctantly joined, while making clear that it was not to be taken seriously. The reasons were explained a year later by Howard French: "Washington's deep-seated ambivalence about a leftward-tilting nationalist whose style diplomats say has sometimes been disquietingly erratic" precludes any meaningful support for sanctions against the military rulers. "Despite much blood on the army's hands, United States diplomats consider it a vital counterweight to Father Aristide, whose class-struggle rhetoric...threatened or antagonized traditional power centers at home and abroad." Aristide's "call for punishment of the military leadership" that had slaughtered and tortured thousands of people "reinforced a view of him as an inflexible and vindictive crusader," and heightened Washington's "antipathy" towards the "clumsy" and "erratic" extremist who has aroused great "anger" because of "his tendency toward ingratitude."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT26" HREF="#FN26">26</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The "vital counterweight" is therefore to hold total power while the "leftward tilting nationalist" remains in exile, awaiting the "eventual return" that Bill Clinton promised on the eve of his inauguration. Meanwhile, the "traditional power centers" in Haiti and the U.S. will carry on with class struggle as usual, employing such terror as may be needed in order for plunder to proceed unhampered. And as the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> added at the same time, Washington was proving oddly ineffective in detecting the "lucrative use of the country in the transhipment of narcotics" by which "the military is funding its oil and other necessary imports," financing the necessary terror and rapacity -- though U.S. forces seem able to find every fishing boat carrying miserable refugees. Nor had Washington figured out a way to freeze the assets of "civil society" or to hinder their shopping trips to Miami and New York, or to induce its Dominican clients to monitor the border to impede the flow of goods that takes care of the wants of "civil society" while the embargo remains "at best, sieve-like."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT27" HREF="#FN27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Meanwhile Washington continued to provide Haitian military leaders with intelligence on narcotics trafficking -- which they naturally used to expedite their activities and tighten their grip on power. It is not easy to intercept narcotraffickers, the press explained, because "Haiti has no radar," and evidently the U.S. Navy and Air Force lack the means to remedy this deficiency.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT28" HREF="#FN28">28</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Under Clinton, matters only got worse. An April 1994 report of Human Rights Watch/Americas documents the increasing terror and State Department apologetics and evasions, condemning the Administration for having "embraced a murderous armed force as a counterweight to a populist president it distrusts."

<P>On February 4, 1992, the Bush Administration lifted the embargo for assembly plants, "under heavy pressure from American businesses with interests in Haiti," the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> reported, with its editorial endorsement; the lobbying effort was assisted by Elliott Abrams, Human Rights Watch noted. For January-October 1992, U.S. trade with Haiti came to $265 million, according to the Department of Commerce.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT29" HREF="#FN29">29</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As Clinton took over, the embargo became still more porous. The Dominican border was left wide open. Meanwhile, U.S. companies continued to be exempted from the embargo -- so as to ease its effects on the population, the Administration announced with a straight face; only exemptions for U.S. firms have this curious feature. There were many heartfelt laments about the suffering of poor Haitians under the embargo, but one had to turn to the underground press in Haiti, the alternative media here, or an occasional letter to learn that the major peasant organization (MPP), church coalitions, labor organizations, and the National Federation of Haitian Students continued to call for a real embargo.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT30" HREF="#FN30">30</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Curiously, some of those most distressed by the impact of the embargo on the Haitian poor were the most forceful advocates of a still harsher embargo on Cuba, notably liberal Democrat Robert Torricelli, author of the stepped-up embargo that the Bush Administration accepted under pressure from the Clintonites. Evidently, hunger causes no pain to Cuban children, another oddity that passed unnoticed, along with the U.S.-Haiti trade figures.

<P>Clinton's tinkering with the embargo also passed without comment here, though the facts are known, and occasionally even leak through, as in a tiny Feb. 13 Reuters dispatch in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reporting efforts of human rights advocates to convince the President to observe the embargo. "US imports from Haiti rose by more than half last year [1993]," the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> reported in London, "thanks in part to an exemption granted by the US Treasury for imports of goods assembled in Haiti from US parts." U.S. exports to Haiti also rose in 1993. Exports from Haiti to the United States included food (fruits and nuts, citrus fruit or melons) from the starving country, which increased by a factor of 35 from January-July 1992 to January-July 1993. The federal government was among the purchasers of the baseballs imported from Haiti (duty free), stitched by women who work 11 hour days with a half-hour break in unbearable heat without running water or a working toilet, for 10 cents an hour if they can meet the quota (few can), using toxic materials without protection so that the U.S. importer can advertise proudly that their softballs are "hand-dipped for maximum bonding." The manufacturers are the wealthy Haitian families who supported the coup and have gained new riches during the embargo, along with others profiting handsomely from the black market, such as the fuel supplier for the U.S. embassy. The "assembly zone" loophole, criticized by U.S. labor unions and at the UN Security Council by France and Canada in January, was extended by the Clinton Administration on April 25, 1994, four days after announcing that it would seek to tighten UN sanctions; the latter announcement was reported. On the same day, the U.S. Coast Guard returned 98 refugees to military authorities, 18 of them at once arrested.

<P>"The Clinton administration still formally declares its support for Mr Aristide, but scarcely disguises its wish for a leader more accommodating to the military," the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> reported, while "European diplomats in Washington are scathing in their comments on what they see as the US's abdication of leadership over Haiti."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT31" HREF="#FN31">31</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In his January 1994 testimony to Congress on "Threats to the U.S.
and Its Interests Abroad," the Director of the CIA predicted that Haiti "probably will be out of fuel and power very shortly." "Our intelligence efforts are focused on detecting attempts to circumvent the embargo and monitoring its impact," and "any indication of an imminent exodus." The "Threats to the U.S." were contained with the usual selectivity and skill. "Exodus" from the charnel house was effectively blocked, while the press reported an "oil boom" as "diplomats expressed amazement at the extent of the trafficking" organized by the Haitian and Dominican armies, and the former assured reporters that "The military is not concerned about fuel shortages; it has plenty.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT32" HREF="#FN32">32</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Clinton Administration has scarcely departed from the prescriptions outlined by the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> and <CITE>New York Times</CITE> as it came into office.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT33" HREF="#FN33">33</A></FONT></SUP> The preferred solution, John Goshko explained in the <CITE>Post,</CITE> would "delay indefinitely" the return to Haiti of the "radical priest with anti-American leanings" whose "strident populism led the Haitian armed forces to seize power," and would "allow Bazin or some other prime minister to govern in his place." Bazin was then prime minister under army rule, but was having problems, because although "well-known and well-regarded in the United States," unfortunately "the masses in Haiti consider him a front man for military and business interests." A replacement would therefore be needed to represent the interests of the moderates. In the <CITE>Times,</CITE> Howard French indicated the scale of the required delay: "In the past, diplomats have said the Haitian President could return only after a substantial interim period during which the country's economy was revived and all its institutions, from the army itself to the judiciary to health care and education, were stabilized." That should overcome the danger of Aristide's "personalist and electoralist politics." But unfortunately, the troublesome priest has been recalcitrant: "Father Aristide and many of his supporters have held out for a quick return," undermining the moderate course.

<P>As understood on all sides, the "delay" need not be too long. 
Aristide's term ends in 1996, and he is barred from running again. By then military terror should have sufficiently intimidated the population and demolished popular organizations so that "free elections" can be tolerated, as in the Central American terror states, without too much fear of any threat to "civil society" from the rabble.

<H3>5. The May 1994 Reversal</H3>

<P>Plans proceeded on course into early 1994. By then, the cynicism and brutality of U.S. policy had become too blatant for the usual cover-up, particularly after Clinton's point man Lawrence Pezzullo revealed in congressional testimony that the plan that the Administration had touted as the product of negotiations among Haitian democrats, denouncing Aristide for his intransigence in rejecting it (it made no provision for his return), had in fact been produced by the State Department, which brought to Washington selected Haitians to ratify it, among them Duvalierist collaborators of the murderous police chief Col. Francois. Something new was needed.

<P>Pezzullo was replaced by William Gray, a more credible voice. In May Clinton instituted a new and more humane refugee policy, which "will mean the forcible return of 95 percent of boat people instead of 100 percent," a Human Rights Watch Haiti analyst observed, pointing out that "The US policy excludes people who are not high profile but are persecuted nonetheless." The new policy is just "window dressing," the national refugee coordinator of Amnesty International added.

<P>But 5% of the boat people fleeing persecution is beyond what the United States can be expected to handle. It will "devastate Florida," a Republican congressional staff member complained. Explaining a few days later why the U.S. might have to invade, "Mr. Clinton saved his strongest warning for what he described as `the continuous possibility' that Haitians left poor and desperate under military rule would join in a `massive outflow' and seek refuge in the United States," the <CITE>Times</CITE> reported; the terms "poor and desperate" convey the doctrine that these are economic refugees. Overcrowded and destitute, the United States plainly cannot bear the burden of accepting refugees or even housing them until their claims of persecution are rejected; and surely it has no historical responsibilities in the matter. The President piteously pleaded with other countries to help us in our plight.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT34" HREF="#FN34">34</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Curiously, the anguished debate over this issue missed the obvious candidate: Tanzania, which had just then accommodated hundreds of thousands of Rwandans, and could surely come to the rescue of the beleaguered United States by accepting a few thousand more black faces.

<P>On May 21, an embargo was announced which, for the first time, may have some serious intent. The "assembly plant" exemption was quietly removed, and the Dominican border was (at least briefly) closed. The long-known involvement of the Haitian military in narcotrafficking was also officially reported. "We're not going to say, `Let the masses and the middle class suffer, but the very wealthy don't have to pay a price," a senior Administration official stated. "Even Wealthy Haitians Starting to Feel Pinched," a <CITE>Times</CITE> headline read, again letting out the real story of the efforts to "restore democracy" during the 2 1/2 years since the coup. Government statements and press reports tacitly conceded what had always been clear: that the U.S. has the means, far short of military intervention, to restore democracy in Haiti, but had no intention of doing so, and still does not. What has always been required is a clear declaration of intent to restore democracy, but that cannot be given, because there is no such intent. The military and their civilian allies understand that perfectly well.

<P>In the following weeks, the U.S. banned commercial air flights and
financial transactions, while leaving crucial loopholes open. Personal assets of the coup supporters were not frozen, so they can withdraw funds from U.S. bank accounts at will and transfer money to banks abroad, Administration officials acknowledged -- a matter that may be academic, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Kweisi Mfume, observed, since "the dictators of Haiti have long ago moved their assets in anticipation of this." The sanctions also permit the families that have long dominated the economy to hold on to the monopoly of the food trade that is a major source of their wealth, including the Mevs family, which is building "a huge new oil depot here to help the army defy the embargo," French reported, adding that "Washington's hesitancy in taking firm action against the business elite and the army is a result of a long history of close ties and perceived common interests," if not fear of "a spate of embarrassing revelations made by Haitians in reprisal for a crackdown."

<P>After sanctions were finally imposed in May 1994, a U.S. diplomat conceded that the continuing failure to move against the richest families has left "a perception out there of sending mixed messages and having double agendas." Other diplomats and Haitian experts agree that the decision not to target key civilian supporters of the coup is yet another mixed signal, noting particularly the relief granted the Mev, Brandt, Acra and Madsen families, who "still have a role to play," a U.S. Embassy source informed the press, though they have made no effort to disguise their support for the coup. Washington is "imposing sanctions designed to strangle the country into restoring Aristide at the same time they are telling the people who backed the coup and are in business with the military in keeping Aristide out that they are free to lead their privileged lives," another diplomat said. Haitian Senators who lead the anti-Aristide movement were not denied their permanent U.S. resident status, including Bernard Sansaricq, who played a leading role in installing the puppet civilian government with its new "president" Emile Jonassaint, appointed to replace Aristide.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT35" HREF="#FN35">35</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Meanwhile, the serious work of undermining the basis for democracy continues unhampered. By the time Clinton took office, as Americas Watch reported, the terror had already decimated the popular organizations that would allow Aristide "to exert civilian authority," even if he were eventually permitted to return. As Clinton finally agreed to sanctions 16 months later, Douglas Farah reported in the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> that "the army and its allies have damaged democratic institutions and grass-roots organizations that had begun to grow in Haiti to such an extent that they would take years to rebuild even if Haiti's military leaders surrendered power, according to diplomats and human rights monitors." "The Duvalierist system will continue, with or without the return of Aristide," the leader of a now-clandestine pro-Aristide group said, a judgment endorsed by "a veteran human rights worker" who prefers anonymity "because of numerous threats against his life." "The Duvialierists have many fine days ahead of them in this country," he said: "People are losing their ability to make things happen here, and it will take many years to reverse that under the best of circumstances." Even nonpolitical community organizations have been repressed, thousands of community leaders have been driven into hiding along with hundreds of thousands of others, while over 4000 have been murdered outright. The "massive terrorism," Farah reports, is "aimed at dismantling the last vestiges of organized support" for Aristide, while the civilian allies of the army and police in FRAPH have "become a very efficient machine of repression," which will remain the only authority even if Aristide were to return, the same human rights worker comments. Members of the popular organizations interviewed in hiding have "applied for political asylum at the U.S. Embassy and been denied.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT36" HREF="#FN36">36</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>To ensure a smooth transition to the intended post-coup system, with the "moderates" in charge and the Duvalierists preserving order, FRAPH and USAID-funded groups linked to it are establishing a monopoly of social services, so that "the poor who are compliant and docile get health services," a Haitian doctor explains. This is the "soft side" of counterinsurgency, on the model of Guatemala and other terror states. Meanwhile we are to ponder the question of whether Haitians "can muster the maturity and cohesiveness to forge a working democracy" (Howard French), or whether we must labor for decades in a (perhaps vain) effort to overcome the defects -- cultural, if not genetic -- that had been discerned by Wilson's Secretary of State and Carter's USAID director in Haiti.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT37" HREF="#FN37">37</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As the Bush Administration prepared to hand over the reins, a senior UN official observed that its dislike of Aristide was an open secret: "Two lines about Haiti co-existed at the time. There was the line about `return to democracy,' which was for public consumption. And then there was a second line, spoken privately within the administration. And the Haitian military knew it perfectly well." A year later, after the <CITE>Harlan County</CITE> affair gave birth to FRAPH, a French military adviser updated the picture: "Do you know what the real problem is? The Americans don't want Aristide back, and they want the rest of us out" -- "the rest of us" being Canada, France and Venezuela, the other three of "Aristide's so-called Four Friends."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT38" HREF="#FN38">38</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>That this judgment is exactly right has been apparent throughout. It should be clear, however, that the issue is not Aristide personally. The problem is the forces he represents: the lively and vibrant popular movements that swept him into office, greatly alarming the rich and powerful in Haiti and their American counterparts, and teaching lessons in democracy that have to be silenced, for who can tell what minds they might reach?

<H1>The Clinton Vision: Update</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky<BR>
<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> January 1994
</CENTER>


<H3>1. Clinton's Bottom Line</H3>

<P>November 17 was a grand day in the career of Bill Clinton, the day when he proved that he is a man of firm principle, and that his "vision" -- the term has become a journalistic reflex -- has real substance. "President Emerges As a Tough Fighter," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> announced on the front page the next day. Washington correspondent R.W. Apple wrote that Clinton had now silenced his detractors, who had scorned him for his apparent willingness to back down on everything he claimed to stand for:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>"Mr. Clinton retreated early on Bosnia, on Haiti, on homosexuals in the military, on important elements of his economic plan [namely, the minuscule stimulative package]; he seemed ready to compromise on all but the most basic elements of his health-care reforms. Critics asked whether he had a bottom line on anything.

<P>On NAFTA, he did, and that question won't be asked much for a while."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></FONT></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In short, on unimportant matters, involving nothing more than millions of lives, Clinton is a "pragmatist," ready to retreat. But when it comes to responding to the calls of the big money, our hero showed that he has backbone after all.

<P>The importance that the corporate world saw in the NAFTA issue was revealed with some clarity in the final stages. Usually, both the President and the media try to keep their class loyalties somewhat in the background. This time, all bars were down. Particularly striking was the bitter attack on labor for daring to interfere in the political process, understood to be the domain of business power in a well-ordered democracy.

<P>The logic is familiar. When ordinary people enter the political arena, we have a "crisis of democracy"; things are OK, however, when the President is able to "govern the country with the cooperation of a relatively small number of Wall Street lawyers and bankers," as the Eaton Professor of the Science of Government at Harvard (Samuel Huntington) has explained, articulating the vision of democracy propounded by elite opinion for hundreds of years.

<P>Accordingly, corporate lobbying was considered unworthy of mention -- a reasonable decision; one also doesn't report the air we breathe.

<P>President Clinton denounced the "naked pressure" and "real roughshod, muscle-bound tactics" of organized labor, "the raw muscle, the sort of naked pressure that the labor forces have put on." They even resorted to "pleading...based on friendship" and "threatening...based on money and work in the campaign" when they approached their elected representatives. Never would a corporate lobbyist sink that low; those who believe otherwise merely reveal themselves to be "Marxists" or "conspiracy theorists," terms that are the cultivated equivalent of four-letter words or a punch in the nose, a last resort when you can't think of an argument. Front-page stories featured the President's call to Congress "to resist the hardball politics" of the "powerful labor interests." Business was reeling from the onslaught, unable to face the terror of the mob. At the outer limits of dissent, Anthony Lewis berated the "backward, unenlightened" labor movement for the "crude threatening tactics" it employed to influence Congress, motivated by "fear of change and fear of foreigners."

<P>In a lead editorial the day before the vote, the <CITE>Times</CITE> courageously confronted the "raw muscle," denouncing local Democrats who oppose NAFTA in fear of "the wrath of organized labor" with its powerful political action committees that "contribute handsomely to their election campaigns." A box within the editorial headed "Labor's Money" records labor contributions to NAFTA opponents in the New York City area -- "an unsettling pattern," the editors observe ominously.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As some aggrieved representatives and others noted, the <CITE>Times</CITE> did not run a box listing corporate contributions. Nor did it list <CITE>Times</CITE> advertisers and owners who support NAFTA, raising ominous questions about their editorial support for the bill, perhaps an instance of an "unsettling pattern." Such reactions are not to the point, however, for several reasons. First, information about corporate lobbyists, owners and advertisers would be irrelevant, since conformity of government and editorial policy to their views is the natural order. And if the hysteria about the improprieties of working people was a bit crass, it is after all understandable in a moment of panic, when the mob is practically at the gates. Furthermore, after endless wailing about the terrifying power of labor and the unfair uses to which it was put, the <CITE>Times</CITE> did run a front-page story revealing the truth: Michael Wines, "Off Stage, Trade Pact Lobby Had a Star's Dressing Room."

<P>The corporate lobbyists, Wines reported, were "Chamber of Commerce types, accountants, trade consultants," who "occupied a stately conference room on the first floor of the Capitol, barely an elevator ride away from the action in the House chamber," with TV sets, cellular telephones, and other appurtenances in abundance, and celebrities everywhere. The picture was enough to convince a former Carter official, now a lobbyist, that "It's going to be a blowout." A look at labor's "raw muscle" only reinforced the conclusion: "The boiler room for the forces opposed to the pact, by contrast, was more of, well, a boiler room," a "barren hearing room" far from the House debate, with only one telephone, "basic black." "The dress was union-label, inexpensive suits and nylon jackets inscribed with numbers and insignias of various locals." Wines even spoke the usually forbidden words "class lines," referring to the "nastier and more divisive battle" over NAFTA, unlike the "previous two battles," which left no scars: the battle over the $19 billion stimulus (quickly lost) and the tax and spending cuts.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>True, the story that finally set things right was published the day <CITE>after</CITE> the vote. But the newsroom is a busy place, media savants explain, and sometimes things fall through the cracks -- in an oddly systematic way.

<P>Before the vote, it wasn't only labor, with its awesome power, that was pummelling Congress while the business world looked on in helpless dismay. The morning of the vote, a front-page story in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> denounced "the muscle-flexing by the broad antitrade coalition," which extends beyond labor bureaucrats to "upscale environmentalists, suburban Perot supporters and thousands of local activists nationwide." These extremists believe that NAFTA is designed "for the benefit of multinational corporations. Their rhetoric is pure down-with-the-rich populism," laced with "conspiratorial, antielitist arguments." A pretty scary crowd.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The news columns of the <CITE>Journal</CITE> usually try to keep a dispassionate tone, leaving Maoist-style ranting to the editorial and opinion pages. But in this case, the pain was too much to bear.


<H3>2. Winners and Losers</H3>

<P>The Wines story on lobbyists was one of several interesting post-vote contributions. In another <CITE>Times</CITE> story, also curiously delayed, Thomas Lueck reviewed the expected economic impact of NAFTA, which had elicited such enthusiasm in the weeks before, rising to virtual hysteria as the day of decision dawned. Leading gainers would be those sectors "based in and around finance," Lueck reported: "the region's banking, telecommunications and service firms" -- that is, insurance companies, investment houses, corporate law firms, the PR industry, and the like. "A vast assortment of professional service firms, from management consultants and public relations to law and marketing, are poised to seek new businesses in Mexico," while "Banks and Wall Street securities firms, which would probably draw more benefit from the pact than any other businesses, say that they are itching to buy Mexican businesses or invest in them." There will be some gainers among manufacturers too, primarily in high technology industry and pharmaceuticals, which will benefit from one of the many protectionist features that made NAFTA so attractive to corporate leaders: the increased protection for patents and "intellectual property" generally, provisions designed to ensure that major corporations, some of which dwarf many governments in scale, will control the technology and products of the future. Other potential gainers include "the region's two largest manufacturing industries," the capital-intensive chemical industry and publishing -- more ominous signals about the <CITE>Times</CITE> editorial policy, by the logic of the editors.

<P>Alongside this impressive array of beneficiaries, there will also unfortunately be a few losers, "predominantly women, blacks and Hispanics," and "semi-skilled production workers" generally. But that was inevitable anyway, and not important enough to merit more than a few side comments in this upbeat analysis of the "Free Trade Accord" -- the part that is "free" being "the amount of money passed around Washington to pass it, said Representative James Traficant," cited at the tail end of the column that belatedly discovered the truth about corporate and labor power. "Change can indeed be painful," as Anthony Lewis admonished the labor movement -- for some, at least.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Noted economists supporting NAFTA made similar points about winners and losers, observing that the only negative consequences of NAFTA would be "a slight fall in the real wages of unskilled U.S. workers" (Paul Krugman) and ridiculing talk about job loss because "only union leaders and Ross Perot would be surprised to hear that the productivity ratio between U.S. and Mexican workers...is higher than the ratio of hourly compensation" (Gary Hufbauer). These scornful rebuttals forgot to add, however, that 70% of the work force is categorized as "unskilled," and that at comparable productivity levels Mexican wages are a fraction of US wages, kept that way by harsh repression, destruction of unions, and a huge army of unemployed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Reports from Mexico also compared winners and losers. "Economists predict that several million Mexicans will probably lose their jobs in the first five years after the accord takes effect," Tim Golden reported from Mexico in the <CITE>Times</CITE> after the House vote; the effect on wages is predictable. "Business leaders like deal; others see rich getting richer," a <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> headline read the day after the vote, reporting that "Mexico's business classes reacted with glee" while "environmental, human rights and labor activists in Mexico continue to criticize the accord." Previously, such voices had been largely unheard, while journalists and economists informed us confidently of the opinions and goals of "the Mexicans" -- who regularly turn out on inspection to be corporate executives, bankers, political leaders, American investors, and the like. Some of them go on to condemn the jingoist "national perspective" of critics of NAFTA who depart from convention by explicitly focussing attention on concerns of Mexican workers and farmers -- not "the Mexicans" -- and thus "implicitly assume that Mexican issues and interests are secondary" (James Galbraith, "What Mexico -- and the United States -- Wants," <CITE>World Policy Journal</CITE>); it takes some skill to thread one's way through the ideological contortions. Readers of the <CITE>Newsletter</CITE> of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations could learn that there were huge demonstrations against NAFTA in Mexico, "well articulated, if too-little-noticed in the United States, cries of frustration against government policies -- involving repeal of constitutional labor, agrarian and education rights stipulated in the nation's popularly revered 1917 constitution -- that appear to many Mexicans as the real meaning of NAFTA and U.S. foreign policy here," realistically enough (historian Seth Fein, writing from Mexico City). Readers of the major media and journals heard little of this.

<P>Mexican concerns about job loss had sometimes been reported before the vote, framed as "worries [that] would seem to rebut critics in the United States who have described Mexico as the clear beneficiary of the accord" (Golden); so we should proceed on course. Occasional more serious commentary reported the great anxiety of Mexican workers not only about job loss but about the erosion of their "hard-won labor rights," likely to "be sacrificed as companies, trying to compete with foreign companies, look for ways to cut costs" (Juanita Darling, <CITE>Los Angeles Times</CITE>) -- a prime reason why the corporate version of NAFTA and other trade agreements, carefully crafted to protect investor but not labor rights, are so appealing to business leaders.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A study carried out by Mexico's leading business journal, <CITE>El Financiero,</CITE> which strongly supported NAFTA, predicted that Mexico would lose almost a quarter of its manufacturing industry and 14% of its jobs in the first two years. Other analysts have predicted that millions of peasants will be driven from the land by cheap US agribusiness exports, enhancing the impact of repression and neoliberal policies that have helped to drive down wages and reduce labor's share in the economy from 36% in the mid-1970s to 23% by 1992, a crucial component of the "economic miracle" that NAFTA advocates hope to "lock in place." Stagnation or perhaps reduction of Mexican wages will then facilitate new pressures to reduce wages of US and Canadian workers, contributing still further to the "welcome development of transcendent importance" that the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> hailed in mid-September: the reduction of US hourly pay below any major industrial country apart from England. Profits will accordingly increase, at least, as long as the social policy designed to enhance the welfare of investors can be sustained.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The economists who preach about the merits of "free trade," knowing the term to be largely fraud, also know the likely consequences of the corporate-executive version of NAFTA. "Many economists think NAFTA could drag down pay," Steven Pearlstein reported in the <CITE>Washington Post,</CITE> expecting that "lower Mexican wages could have a gravitational effect on the wages of Americans." A study by one leading specialist, Edward Leamer of UCLA, concludes that the kind of globalization that is enhanced by this NAFTA "would add about $3000 a year to the earnings of professional and technical workers by the end of the decade while reducing the income of everyone else by $750 -- a loss of about $200 a year for the average American," sufficient reason to explain the overwhelming enthusiasm for the Bush-Clinton NAFTA on the part of corporate power and their spokespersons.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></FONT></SUP> The reasons for the gravitational effect do not lie in "free trade principles," which have only limited relevance to an international economy of a corporate mercantilist character with vast state intervention, but are an inherent part of the social policies that are implemented by the powerful, and built into their version of "trade agreements."

<P>Commentary on the impact of NAFTA on "Mexico," "the United States," and "Canada," or what these entities "want," is at best meaningless, at worst vulgar propaganda. The "class lines" that the <CITE>Times</CITE> detected after the fray tell a truer story. The version of NAFTA rammed through by state-corporate power is designed to carry forward the internationalization of the economy in a particular form, which includes the extension to the industrial societies of the Third World pattern of sharply two-tiered societies.

<P>The primary stakes are not the impact on jobs, about which little is understood with any confidence, the economic models being so remote from reality. Or even wages, though the conclusions here are more persuasive. A more far-reaching issue, as critics of the executive version of NAFTA have stressed from the outset, is the erosion of freedom and democracy, both process and culture, as parliamentary institutions are increasingly displaced by decision-makers and investors who operate within their own totalitarian institutions or in the quasi-governmental structures that have taken shape to serve the needs of transnational corporations and finance. The "transcendent importance" of removing the annoyances of democracy is revealed in a vulgar way by the hysteria about labor's "raw muscle," but in fact lies far deeper.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The conclusion holds for Mexico as well. Advocates here speak of the compelling need to "lock Mexico into its pro-market reforms" as the primary motivation for NAFTA (editorial, <CITE>New York Times</CITE>). They are expressing once again the abiding fear that a "`democracy opening' in Mexico could test the special relationship by bringing into office a government more interested in challenging the U.S. on economic and nationalist grounds," the dark cloud on the far horizon that a Latin America Strategy Workshop in Washington saw in September 1990. Perhaps a "democracy opening" cannot be forestalled forever, but at least an agreement with near-treaty status may block the grim effects of policies directed to some interests beyond those of investors. Mexican political scientist Jorge Casta$eda may exaggerate when he writes that "the whole purpose of NAFTA" was to strengthen the "authoritarian regime" of the always-ruling party, the PRI, but there is little doubt that a major purpose was to "lock in" the benefits that repression and violence offer for profit-making.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></FONT></SUP>


<H3>3. "Wooing, and Pleasing, Big Business"</H3>

<P>It was not only the pose of media objectivity and independence of class interests that was cast aside as the day of the crucial House vote neared. The pretense that the executive NAFTA was a "free trade" pact also became too inconvenient to maintain. "In Twist, Protectionism Is Used to Sell Trade Pact," the <CITE>Times</CITE> proclaimed with wonder, discovering what both critics and advocates of the "Trade Pact" had been shouting from the rooftops for a year. The protectionist features of NAFTA had been "negotiated by the Bush Administration out of political necessity to drum up corporate support," economic correspondent Keith Bradsher reported, but "went largely unnoticed until recently, when they began to attract criticism from abroad, notably from Japan."

<P>The example illustrates the power of ideological institutions to shield themselves, and their audiences, from unwanted ideas and discussion. The task of the day has been to laud the US for its dedication to the free market -- "the wave of the future -- a future for which America is both the gatekeeper and the model," as ideologues exuberantly proclaim. The executive version of NAFTA was therefore a "free trade" agreement by ideological necessity, independently of the fact that it went far beyond trade and was anything but free, not as a matter of negotiation out of political necessity but in its essential design, and was attractive to domestic business power in large part for these reasons. One cannot expect the Free Press to attend to critical commentary from the Third World, or to anything beyond the very narrow spectrum of respectability at home. But it takes some discipline not to hear corporate executives lauding NAFTA for its protectionist features, or the voices of eminently respectable specialists, ranging from supporters of trade regulation like Clyde Prestowicz, who came to support NAFTA in part because its provisions favoring North American (effectively, US) firms "will let us better compete with Asians," to leading advocates of free trade such as economist Jagdish Bhagwati, who wrote in <CITE>Foreign Affairs</CITE> that NAFTA is "dressed up as a great free trade move" though "it is evident that the main motivation is protectionist: Mexico becomes America's preferential market, with Japan and the EC at a disadvantage." Hence the "passionate support" in business circles for NAFTA as compared to GATT, where "any advantages America [i.e., US business] gains...are equally doled out to rivals." All this is aside from such protectionist features as the intellectual property rights provisions on which US state-corporate power insists.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Clinton Administration "has resorted to the odd tactic of selling a free-trade pact by highlighting its protectionist provisions," Bradsher reports. Translating to English, Clinton resorted to the quite understandable tactic of highlighting the protectionist provisions that are at the heart of the agreement and that account for the "passionate support" of business, while the pose that this is "a free-trade pact" cannot be sustained under duress, even by the doctrinal institutions.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Clinton's advisers understood that well. In his "11th-Hour Bid for NAFTA," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reported, Clinton stressed that if the US did not succeed in locking Mexico into its protectionist sphere, the Japanese would do so; hardly a likely contingency, though the rhetoric is enlightening. Clinton's key point, the <CITE>Journal</CITE> observed, is "that Japan and Europe will capture the Mexican market if the U.S. doesn't"; we'd better establish protectionist barriers quickly, or someone will beat us to it.

<P>The President also addressed a plea to US corporations to make a public pledge not to move jobs to Mexico, assurances that "would be particularly timely as the highly charged NAFTA debate winds down," the <CITE>Journal</CITE> observed. Of course, if NAFTA advocates believed what they publicly proclaim, such a call would be absurd: after all, the agreement is supposed to provide a flow of "jobs, jobs, jobs." But anything goes, in the desperate effort to ram through an agreement on investor rights that locks the door, one hopes, on a potential democratic threat.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The business community is naturally pleased by Clinton's firmness in defending the "bottom line," and understands well just how far that line reaches. A lead <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> article on November 19 was headed: "Unlikely Allies: President Is Wooing, And Mostly Pleasing, Big-Business Leaders." The article does not explain why it is so "unlikely" that a conservative and outspokenly pro-business "New Democrat" should have kept to his consistent course; his "affinity for the business establishment continues a pattern begun when he was governor of Arkansas," the <CITE>Journal</CITE> observes, recalling his "close working relationship with the group of top corporate executives nicknamed the Good Suit Club" -- all in pursuit of "jobs," the report hastens to assure us, using the conventional paraphrase for the forbidden "P-word." Unlikeness aside, the <CITE>Journal</CITE> report accurately describes the President's continuing "affinity." He is "aggressively wooing big business, inviting small groups of top corporate executives...to lunch. On issue after issue, Mr. Clinton and his administration come down on the same side as corporate America," NAFTA being "only the most conspicuous example." Others include the big government initiatives that corporate America admires, among them the proposal that "the government pick up the health-insurance tab for big companies' early retirees" and the plan "to alter U.S. foreign aid to force recipients to buy more U.S. goods" while suppressing human rights concerns. Clinton has also wisely "avoided the extremes of environmental regulation and is moving toward compromise on such contentious matters as reform of the Superfund dump-cleaning program." "`We're getting along much better with this administration than we did with previous ones," confides Harold `Red' Poling, the recently retired chairman of Ford Motor Company." Others agree. The Chairman of Bethlehem Steel ranks Clinton as "good for American business" on issue after issue: trade, health, the economic plan, etc.

<P>Clinton's pro-business attitudes are fine-tuned, the <CITE>Journal</CITE> continues: "Democratic presidents do tend to appeal more to big corporations than to the legions of small-business owners," and Clinton is no exception. His health care plan "is far kinder to big companies than to small ones," also favoring "major insurers" over smaller ones; "and big companies are the big winners" on other health-related issues. Business is also generally pleased with Clinton on fiscal and environmental policies. In the latter domain, the report continues, the only lapse of the Clinton-Gore team that troubles executives is an order to the government to use more recycled paper. On trade, beyond NAFTA, business is pleased with Clinton initiatives to strongarm competitors and "his plan to link about $150 million in foreign aid to purchases of US goods," another proper form of state intervention to protect business from market forces. The "activist Clinton presidency has revived the Business Roundtable, which consists of 200 big-company CEOs." Formerly a major business advocacy group, the Roundtable "was nearly irrelevant" under the Republicans (self-lobbying being unnecessary) but has now again become a "major player" thanks to Clinton's activist presidency, forming the core of the NAFTA lobby among other tasks. The big government New Democrat is a man of principle across the board, the business community is pleased to see.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As these developments again illustrate, it is a calumny to claim that politics in the world's leading democracy is limited to two factions of the business party. On the contrary, there is a spectrum ranging from the party of big business all the way to the party that "aggressively woos and pleases" it, marginalizing other concerns. It is that model that we must proudly defend, and make sure that others understand and adopt for themselves.


<H3>4. The Summit Triumph</H3>

<P>Particularly gratifying to Clinton's Business Roundtable friends is the decision to maintain China's "favorable trade status." The issue reached the front pages right after the NAFTA victory, as Clinton took off to lead the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group (APEC) summit in Seattle. The events posed a number of problems for government-media doctrinal management. One was to portray the events with sufficient grandeur while conceding that nothing had happened. A second was the usual problem of presenting massive state intervention in economic affairs in the interests of corporate power as dedication to the free market. A narrower problem was to reconcile our deep commitment to democracy and human rights with the open courting of China, overlooking its record and its role in missile and nuclear proliferation, a problem rendered even more difficult by Clinton's decision to provide China with means to pursue these policies more effectively. Let's have a look at how these onerous tasks were handled.

<P>The first two were not too demanding. There was much hullabaloo about Clinton's "grand vision for Asia," while only on the back pages was it conceded quietly that the Summit achieved nothing. "The unusual combination of energy and ambiguity" -- meaning PR and reality -- "that surrounded this meeting was captured in a `vision statement' issued by the leaders at the close of their session," Thomas Friedman reported toward the end of an upbeat lead story: "It was long on vision and short on specifics." One achievement, however, was that the Asian leaders picked up the favored rhetorical styles, learning how to scatter the word "vision" profusely through their pronouncements and interviews.

<P>It was the "grand vision," not the missing specifics, that was in the forefront. "Clinton Preaches Open Markets at Summit," the headline of the lead <CITE>Times</CITE> news story read. "We have agreed that our economic policies should be open, not closed," the President declared. Clinton is undertaking "what may be the biggest rethinking of American policy toward Asia" in the past half century, David Sanger wrote in the lead story of the <CITE>Times Week in Review,</CITE> stressing "the breadth of Clinton's vision of a Pacific Community" dedicated to free trade and open markets as he spoke "inside a giant airplane hangar at the Boeing company." Boeing is the country's largest exporter, Sanger noted.

<P>More generally, civilian aircraft constitute the leading US export, running a net trade surplus of $17.8 billion in 1991. Furthermore, US comparative advantage in the international economy increasingly lies in services, not manufacture, and "by far the largest export of U.S. services is travel and tourism, which accounts for a third of the service surplus," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reports; travel and tourism means aircraft. Accordingly, it is natural for Clinton to tout the marvels of the free market at the Boeing Company, telling "a cheering throng" that Boeing "is a model for companies across America" and the prime example of the "new vision of American relations with Asia," where "China alone now buys one of every six of [Boeing's] planes"; the other prime example is the Cray supercomputer corporation, given a boost by Clinton's decision to sell its advanced computers to China in violation of congressional legislation, announced at the same time.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Or is it natural? Hidden in the crevices is the embarrassing fact that Boeing, Cray supercomputers, and the aircraft and computer industry generally are the prime modern examples of the dramatic departures from the free market that created and sustained a viable economy in the United States (as elsewhere). These industries were founded and survive thanks to enormous taxpayer subsidies. They have always been funded through the Pentagon funnel, a system devised in the late 1940s with exactly that purpose in mind as even the public record demonstrates, one of several major government programs to impose a particular kind of state capitalist social and economic order. Another was the program of "suburbanizing America" which, under the cover of defense, established the modern motor and air transport industries as core elements of the economy, with a cost to the public that goes far beyond the tens of billions of taxpayer dollars used in this massive government social engineering project.

<P>In the case of aircraft, hence the tourism industry as well, the facts are too obvious to require discussion. As for computers, their development was fully funded by the public in the 1950s, before they became marketable and therefore handed over to "private enterprise"; in electronics generally, government funding covered 85% of all R&D in 1958. The public subsidy continued, mounting again under Reagan-Bush in the guise of Star Wars and through the initiatives of DARPA (the Pentagon research funding agency) which "became a pivotal market force" in high-performance computing from the early 1980s, <CITE>Science</CITE> magazine reports, "boosting massively parallel computing from the laboratory into a nascent industry," now to be extended through a multi-agency government supercomputing agency that will aim for speeds of a trillion operations per second, focusing more on "the crowded field of young supercomputer companies it had played a role in creating" than on university teams.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A few problems might arise, then, in offering aircraft and supercomputers as the "model" for the "grand free market vision." They might arise, that is, if the self-image that the ideological institutions portray with such awe had any resemblance to reality. In any event, the problems did not arise.

<P>Sanger also observes that Boeing is involved in co-production with Mitsubishi in Nagoya, Japan, one element of "multi-million dollar, job-creating investments outside the United States on a scale that would terrify NAFTA's opponents." This, he notes, is another aspect of the Clinton "vision that implies tradeoffs and job displacements far more wrenching than any posed by" NAFTA. Adding the forbidden fact that Boeing is a publicly-funded private corporation, we conclude that US workers are providing funds to Boeing executives for them to use in "job-creating investments" abroad on a massive scale. Boeing executives, not workers in the plants or communities, have the unrestricted right to make such decisions about disbursal of public funds under the "free market" assumptions that permit totalitarian control within huge publicly-funded corporate institutions that increasingly dominate cross-border commercial interchanges -- hardly "trade," in any serious sense. The model for the free market future is the kind of absolute unaccountable power and taxation without representation that outraged 18th century libertarians.

<P>Economists will surely be at hand to explain with proper scorn that in the long run the job-displacements arranged by Boeing executives will benefit all, at least in the universe of their abstract models. The real world and major human concerns are another matter. The question "who decides," and by what right, is not a topic in an intellectual culture that excludes any concern over functioning democracy and its contemporary erosion.

<P>The same is true of more technical matters, for example, the market distortions from internal pricing policies of transnational corporations, which may be quite substantial in scale, political economist Ian Robinson observes, but, unlike governmental tariff and non-tariff barriers, do not fall within the purview of the "trade agreements." Yet another footnote to the odes to the new world order of free trade and open markets is added by a 1992 OECD study, which concludes that "Oligopolistic competition and strategic interaction among firms and governments rather than the invisible hand of market forces condition today's competitive advantage and international division of labor in high-technology industries."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The question of supercomputers brings us to the third problem for doctrinal managers: China. That proved a harder nut to crack, and the conflicting versions are almost as bewildering as White House leaks of its health plan.

<P>It was hard to overlook the fact that "Mr. Clinton is touchingly ardent in his efforts to get along" with China, R.W. Apple reported from the Seattle APEC summit, seeing "trade with China as the magic elixir that can cure many of the ills of the American economy." Secretary of State Warren Christopher, "defending the decision to sell a supercomputer to the Chinese for the first time since the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989, said...that the United States had to close a $19 billion trade deficit with China,...human rights symbolism notwithstanding...," Sanger reports. The supercomputer sale reflects the fact that the Administration is "eager to give a lift to the financially troubled" Cray corporation, Elaine Sciolino added from Washington, noting that "Even more significant for American business, the Administration has also decided to lift the ban on important components for China's nuclear power plants, like generators," which "could mean billions of dollars in sales" for GE. Christopher also assured China that the Clinton Administration "would be prepared to interpret an American law governing the export of high technology to allow the export of two of the seven sophisticated American-made satellites banned by sanctions imposed on China in August [1993], senior Administration officials said," referring to the legislation passed by Congress after US intelligence provided "conclusive proof" that China was exporting missile technology and equipment in violation of international agreements (Sciolino); a Pentagon official, questioning the wisdom of sending China equipment for nuclear power plants, added that China had "disregarded American appeals to end its nuclear cooperation with Iran."

<P>The Chinese leaders did not make Clinton's task easy: they "gave no ground at all on human rights" and "provided no fig-leaf to cover President Clinton's nakedness," Apple reports, noting however that it was only "a relatively unsophisticated Cray supercomputer," so the "grand vision" remains unsullied, just as it survived the effective exclusion of human rights issues, even the right of workers to organize, from NAFTA. Two days earlier, Sciolino had cited "senior American officials" as saying that it was "a sophisticated $8 million dollar supercomputer" that the US was selling to China -- as "a good will gesture toward China," "part of the Administration's strategy to embrace, rather than isolate, China despite disagreements over human rights, weapons proliferation and trade." At the tail end of impressive oratory on the "vision," brief news clips reported that 81 workers died in a factory fire in southeastern China, most of them locked in "to keep people inside during working hours," a factory spokesman said. This China-Hong Kong joint venture makes dolls, probably for sale to American children as Christmas presents; let's hope any dried blood was washed off. Two people had been killed by toxic fumes at another toy factory a week earlier, and on August 5, an explosion and fire at a chemical depot killed 18 people and injured dozens more. The deadly accidents "have drawn attention to industrial safety conditions in southern China," widely hailed as the site of an "economic miracle." The attention apparently did not reach as far as Seattle, where Clinton was "embracing" the Chinese rulers and proclaiming his "grand vision," to much applause.

<P>Squaring the circle becomes still more difficult as we proceed. Clinton's new "notion of national security," Thomas Friedman explains, rests on two principles: "promoting free trade and stemming missile proliferation." Sciolino's adjacent column describes the sale of a sophisticated supercomputer and nuclear power equipment to China, all produced in radical violation of free trade doctrines and easily adaptable for missile and nuclear weapons proliferation. Further proliferation should hardly come as a surprise to the Administration that "decided to allow the sale despite clear evidence that China has broken its promises to Washington by exporting M-11 missile components and technology to Pakistan" in violation of an international missile control accord. The supercomputer is for weather prediction, the Administration assures us, and will be used "under strict conditions, including substantial American monitoring that will prevent its diversion for military uses." A Pentagon official involved in proliferation issues added the obvious: "if the Chinese manage to use the supercomputer in a weapons program, no one's going to go in there and pull the plug." Other Asian and US sources said that the "advanced supercomputer...would be useful in China's strategic weapons programs, particularly in simulated tests of new missiles," Paul Quinn-Judge reported, quoting US specialists who say that China is engaged in "the world's most comprehensive program of transfer of missile technology," providing missiles to Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq, and possibly having helped North Korea in the development of a 600-mile range missile.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Summarizing, Clinton's "grand vision" for free trade, ending weapons proliferation, and promoting human rights rests on the following principles. The model is state-subsidized corporations that use taxpayer dollars to maximize their profits, investing where they choose whatever the effects on their workers and communities, those who pay the bills generally, and workers and communities abroad. High technology and other exports will be provided to leading human rights violators who may use them freely for missile and nuclear weapons proliferation in violation of international agreements. Labor rights and human rights concerns generally -- say, the right not to be burned to death when you are locked into a factory -- are off the agenda, except, of course, for those who do not offer commercial advantage for US corporations, and official enemies who get in the way.

<P>In short, the powerful do what they want, leaving it to the educated classes to construct the proper imagery.

<P>Another slight problem is that Clinton had "accused Mr. Bush during the presidential campaign of not doing enough to halt the spread of nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic missile technology" (Sciolino). But having taken over the reins, "in effect, [Clinton] said that abuses of civil liberties in China must not be ignored but must not be permitted to dominate the relationship -- a formulation remarkably like that which guided the Bush Administration and which Mr. Clinton roundly criticized during the 1992 campaign," adopting it now as part of his "continuing effort to loosen the linkage between human rights and commercial relations" (Apple). These, however, are just more of the unimportant issues that don't bear on Clinton's "bottom line," which he firmly held, silencing his critics, as Apple had explained two days earlier. They fall in the same category as Clinton's first decision: to modify the Bush policy of turning back Haitian refugees, which he had bitterly condemned during the campaign, by harshening it further with a total blockade -- a blockade which, somehow, seems to miss the boats that sustain the military rulers by ferrying drugs in and out. 

<P>"There was no linkage" in the supercomputer sale to China, a senior Administration official said. Not too much of a surprise, after all. As well-known, Clinton drew much of his top staff from the Carter Administration, which opened its human rights crusade by confronting the issue of arms sales to Iran, the world's leading purchaser of US arms and ranking high (perhaps first) in torture of political prisoners and other human rights violations. In April 1977, the Carter Administration addressed the problem forthrightly by imposing pressures on Iran -- to purchase advanced armaments that it had not requested and probably could not use, sophisticated surveillance planes to monitor and control air battles, at a cost of $850 million. US Air Force personnel would operate the system, reports from Washington indicated. Visiting Teheran a month later, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance stated that "no...linkage has been discussed" between arms sales and human rights, also clarifying to reporters that his talks with the Shah had "laid no particular stress" on human rights issues. "Each country has a responsibility to itself to deal with terrorist problems," Vance told the press, and the new Human Rights Administration had little to say to the Shah about such matters.

<P>Reporting the April 1977 efforts to sell Iran advanced armaments, the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> observed that "one of the principal reasons behind the Pentagon pressure for the offer to Iran was to keep the Boeing production line open." More generally, sale of arms to oil producers was one of the devices employed to sustain the publicly-subsidized privately-run corporations that are the "model" for the free market vision, and to ensure that the huge profits from oil production would continue to flow to the US (and its British client), not to the people of the region, the central doctrine of US Middle East policy. In pursuit of the same goals, James Baker and George Bush intervened in a secret meeting in October 1989 to ensure that their friend Saddam Hussein would receive another $1 billion in loan guarantees, overcoming Treasury and Commerce department objections that Iraq was not creditworthy. Gassing of Kurds and torture of dissidents were not issues, linkage with human rights concerns having been properly loosened. The additional $1 billion for Saddam was justified, the State Department explained, because Iraq was "very important to US interests in the Middle East," being "influential in the peace process" and "a key to maintaining stability in the region, offering great trade opportunities for US companies."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Interesting to see how much changes over the years, as one vision replaces another.


<H3>5. The Broader Vision</H3>

<P>Meanwhile, other elements of the vision fell into place. While linkage to human rights and proliferation was being loosened at the Seattle Summit, USAID announced that 21 missions serving 35 countries and territories would be terminated as Washington reduced its aid program, one of the most miserly in the industrial world, still further. The announcement was "criticized by David Beckman, president of Bread for the World, a Christian organization dedicated to alleviating hunger," AP reported. "Mr. Beckman said most of the cutbacks affect very poor countries. The problems of hunger, poverty and environmental degradation are not priorities for the Clinton Administration, he asserted." They too fall below the "bottom line."

<P>On the front page the same day, <CITE>Times</CITE> correspondent Clifford Krauss reported that the Senate passed "a broad and expensive anticrime package whose leading provisions would add 100,000 police officers to the nation's streets, build a network of high-security regional prisons and create more boot camps for young offenders," also extending the death penalty to 52 Federal crimes and requiring states that receive Federal money for the construction of the new regional prisons to adopt harsher sentencing rules. This $23 billion package over 5 years "would amount to a sixfold increase in the annual subsidy that Washington now gives to state and local governments to fight crime." An amendment, passed unanimously, allows for secret deportation trials for "alien terrorists," though "it couldn't even get to the floor during the Reagan-Bush years," the <CITE>Nation</CITE> editors observe. Another makes membership in a street gang a crime. Another, passed by 91-1, requires automatic life imprisonment without parole for a third felony, whatever the offense.

<P>It is "the finest anticrime package in history," Senator Orrin Hatch remarked, observing the proceedings with pleasure from the far right. "Mr. Clinton did not have to engage in much lobbying on behalf of the bill," Krauss added, though he presumably would have done so if necessary, having always taken pains to show that he is one tough hombre. Writing in the London <CITE>Sunday Telegraph</CITE> several months earlier, American TV correspondent Charles Glass had asked "what is the connection between an Iraqi artist named Layla al-Attar, and Rickey Ray Rector, a black man executed in 1992 for murder in Arkansas?" The answer, he pointed out, is Bill Clinton's need to improve his ratings, in one case, by sending missiles to bomb Baghdad, killing al-Attar among others; in the other, by returning to Arkansas in the midst of his presidential campaign to supervise the execution of a mentally incapacitated prisoner, proving "that a Democrat could be tough on crime." Alexander Cockburn drew the same connection here in a <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> Op-ed, a jarring note in the general enthusiasm for Clinton's war crime. The new legislation merely updates it.

<P>Law-enforcement experts doubt that "even legislation this vast" will have a significant effect on crime unless it deals with the "causes of social disintegration that produce violent criminals," Krauss continues. The social disintegration is an integral part of the "vision," as policy is crafted to entrench more deeply the Third World model of a two-tiered society, with a surplus population that is increasingly useless for profit-making, the value to which all else must be subordinated.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Reviewing "Clinton's accomplishments" as the Seattle summit ended, the liberal <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> detected real progress, even signs of "a potential transformation" in American politics. "Even a majority of Republican voters think Clinton has a vision," a GOP pollster says. True, "much of Clinton's `vision' has yet to become law," and his "record at transforming his ideas into reality is not perfect." But it is impressive nonetheless, with real successes: raising taxes on the wealthy, protecting the right of abortion and guaranteed parental leave, and the "motor voter" bill that allows people to register when they get a driver's license. They forgot to mention the environmental initiative that marred the record otherwise applauded by the business community: the order to government offices to use more recycled paper.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A closer look at Clinton's accomplishments suggest that the business leaders sampled in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> have a sharper eye.

<H1>The Clinton Vision</H1>

<P>Noam Chomsky<BR>
<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> December 1993
</CENTER>

<P>At the end of September, the Clinton Administration finally addressed "the vision thing" in the domain of foreign policy, with major addresses by the President and Secretary of State, and of particular significance, by National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, who laid forth the intellectual foundations of the new Clinton doctrine at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. A new National Export Strategy was announced that set guidelines for international economic policy, and a White House panel on intervention applied the doctrine in this particular sphere, all within a few days. The seriousness of the enterprise was duly recorded with such headlines as "U.S. Vision of Foreign Policy Reversed" (Thomas Friedman, <CITE>New York Times</CITE>), implying a dramatic policy change.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The new vision is based on a picture of the contemporary world that has risen well beyond opinion, to the heights of truism. The picture is sketched eloquently by the <CITE>Times</CITE> chief diplomatic correspondent, Thomas Friedman: "America's victory in the cold war," Friedman wrote a year ago, was "a victory for a set of political and economic principles: democracy and the free market." At last, the world is coming to understand that "the free market is the wave of the future -- a future for which America is both the gatekeeper and the model."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The term "gatekeeper" has an ominous ring. The whole affair merits some thoughts about how we keep the gates, who we let in, and what kind of model we are to offer to the world. We begin with Anthony Lake's address, recognized to be the centerpiece of the new vision.

<H3>1. "From Containment to Enlargement"</H3>

<P>A long-time liberal dove, Lake explained that "Throughout the cold war, we contained a global threat to market democracies: now we should seek to enlarge their reach." Containment having succeeded, we can now go on to "enlargement -- enlargement of the world's free community of market democracies." The title of his address is: "From Containment to Enlargement." That is the new vision that replaces the defensive stance of the past half century. People everywhere can only hail this new departure, realizing that "of course" the US is unlike any other nation past or present, Lake observes, in that "we do not seek to expand the reach of our institutions by force, subversion or repression." Commentators were duly impressed by this enlightened stance.

<P>A rational person who wanted to know what Russia (pre-Gorbachev) was <I>trying to do</I> in world affairs would, naturally, look at what Russia <I>did do</I> where its influence reached, specifically, in the East European satellites. Undertaking that exercise, sane people -- assuming that they did not simply collapse in ridicule -- would have known how to evaluate an announcement by Leonid Brezhnev that the USSR would no longer be content with containing the Evil Empire, but would now move on to "enlargement" of the community of free and democratic societies. Similarly, sane people who wanted to know what the US is trying to do in world affairs would look at what it <I>has done</I> where its influence reached, and would evaluate the announcement of the new vision in these terms -- again, assuming that they did not simply collapse in ridicule. It is interesting that the questions that would occur to a moderately intelligent 10 year old do not seem to have been raised.

<P>This stance might be justified by the argument often voiced in sophisticated circles that in the special case of the United States, facts are irrelevant. Thus in the prestigious journal <CITE>International Security,</CITE> the Eaton Professor of the Science of Government at Harvard instructs us that the United States must maintain its "international primacy" for the benefit of the world, because its "national identity is defined by a set of universal political and economic values," namely "liberty, democracy, equality, private property, and markets" (Samuel Huntington). Since this is a matter of <I>definition</I>, so the Science of Government teaches, it would be an error of logic to bring up the factual record, and we would simply be illustrating our silliness by doing so, as if Orwell's Winston Smith had experimented with objects scattered on a table top to test Big Brother's denial that 2+2 = 4.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Lacking sophistication, let us proceed nonetheless.

<P>We might also tarry briefly on Orwell's core concerns, not given quite the prominence of his critique of the official enemy. In an unpublished introduction to <CITE>Animal Farm,</CITE> Orwell wrote that "The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary. Unpopular ideas can be silenced, and inconvenient facts kept dark, without any need for any official ban." The desired outcome is attained in part by the "general tacit agreement that `it wouldn't do' to mention that particular fact," in part as a consequence of media concentration in the hands of "wealthy men who have every motive to be dishonest on certain important topics." As a result, "Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness."

<P>Orwell believed that the United States was different, more free and open. That error was not made by John Dewey, more familiar with US intellectual culture. Speaking of "our un-free press," he observed that critique of "specific abuses" is of limited value: "The only really fundamental approach to the problem is to inquire concerning the necessary effect of the present economic system upon the whole system of publicity; upon the judgment of what news is, upon the selection and elimination of matter that is published, upon the treatment of news in both editorial and news columns." We should ask "how far genuine intellectual freedom and social responsibility are possible on any large scale under the existing economic regime." Not very far, he judged.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The reaction to Clinton's new vision falls well within these strictures, though to document the (virtually exceptionless) pattern of which this is a typical instance is something of a waste of time, as Orwell and Dewey recognized. The more firmly conclusions are established that challenge system-supportive doctrine, the more they must be suppressed; if the conclusions were established by the standards of physics, they would have to be buried so deep in the memory hole as to be completely beyond recovery. Those who fail to grasp these simple requirements would be well advised to seek a trade outside of the respectable intellectual culture, where the gatekeepers understand what "it wouldn't do" to say or think.

<P>Returning to the questions that would at once occur to a naive ten year old, to evaluate the announcement of the new vision, we turn to US behavior in regions where its influence reached. There are many choices, the US being a global power. But the most illuminating will surely be the Western Hemisphere, where the US has long run the show virtually without interference, so its deepest values and convictions are revealed with great clarity.

<P>According to the doctrine that we are to accept as unquestioned truth, "throughout the Cold War we contained a global threat to market democracies" in the Western hemisphere, never having sought to expand our power "by force, subversion, or repression," from the days when we were "exterminating...that hapless race of native Americans...with such merciless and perfidious cruelty" (John Quincy Adams), until the present. To put the best possible face on the higher truths that it is unthinkable to question, let us select the peak moments of American liberalism, the days of JFK and LBJ (who far surpassed his predecessor in his commitment to liberal ideals). Taking just the most important case of the many that come to mind, the higher truth entails, then, that at the peak of modern liberalism, JFK and LBJ dedicated themselves to the violent overthrow of the parliamentary government in Brazil in favor of a National Security State in order to contain a global threat to market democracy.

<P>So, indeed, the matter was perceived. Kennedy's Ambassador Lincoln Gordon, who moved on to Washington after helping lay the groundwork for the coup, lauded the "democratic rebellion" of the neo-Nazi Generals as "a great victory for the free world," "one of the major turning points in world history." "The principal purpose for the Brazilian revolution was to preserve and not destroy Brazil's democracy," the respected liberal democratic statesman informed Congress two years later, while the torturers and murderers were -- very visibly -- at work. It was "the single most decisive victory of freedom in the mid-twentieth century," he testified, and should "create a greatly improved climate for private investments" -- a comment we may file away for later reference. After leaving the State Department, Gordon went on to become the President of Johns Hopkins University, where Lake announced the new revolution in foreign policy.

<P>As the Generals instituted a regime of fascist terror, Brazil became "the Latin American darling of the international business community," the business press reported. It was also hailed by the leading academic apostles of the free market, much impressed by the purity of doctrine of the technocrats and the "miracle" they had wrought -- though in fairness, it should be added that there were occasional reservations about the sadistic violence by which the miracle was instituted. The euphoria persisted through the 1980s, until the fortunes of the rich began to be affected by the economic disaster, at which point the methods that had been hailed as a "real American success story," yielding "impressive economic growth based solidly on capitalism," were suddenly transmuted to a proof of the failure of statist interference with our market ideals; the self-adulation, not untypical, is quoted from a highly regarded 1989 scholarly monograph by Gerald Haines, senior historian of the CIA.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Brazil is a highly illuminating case, perhaps the reason why "it wouldn't do" to reflect on the obvious lessons. Brazil is far and away the most important country in Latin America, firmly under US control since 1945, when it became a "testing area for modern scientific methods of industrial development" applied by US experts, Haines observes with pride. It is a country with enormous resources that should be the "Colossus of the South," ranking alongside the "Colossus of the North," as predicted early in the century. It has had no foreign enemies, and benefited not only from careful US tutelage but also from substantial investment. It therefore shows with great clarity just what the US can achieve in "enlarging the free community of market democracies" under conditions that are near ideal.

<P>The successes are real enough. Brazil has enjoyed a very high growth rate, which conferred enormous wealth on everyone except its population -- apart from the top few percent, who live at the standards of the wealthiest Westerners. It is a sharply two-tiered society. Much of the population live at a level reminiscent of Central Africa. As Haines was hailing the success story of American style capitalism, the UN <CITE>Report on Human Development</CITE> ranked this rich and privileged country in 80th place, alongside of Albania and Paraguay. In the northeast, Brazilian medical researchers describe a new subspecies: "pygmies," with 40% the brain capacity of humans, thanks to severe malnutrition in a region with fertile lands, owned by large plantations that produce export crops in accord with the doctrines preached by their expert advisers. Hundreds of thousands of children die of starvation every year in this success story, which also wins world prizes for child slavery and murder of street children -- in some cases for export of organs for transplant, according to respected Brazilian sources.

<P>Perhaps Brazil was unusual. We might therefore look elsewhere, perhaps Guatemala, turned into a "showcase for capitalism" in 1954 when Washington overthrew the democratic capitalist government and soon to celebrate the fortieth year of our achievements in exterminating another "hapless race of native Americans with such merciless and perfidious cruelty," along with others who were in the way. Or El Salvador, the recipient of some $6 billion in "aid" from the US in the 1980s. The results, always well known outside of Orwell's "prevailing orthodoxy," were recently reviewed by the UN Truth Commission, which attributed 85% of the horrendous record of atrocities to the security forces trained, armed, and advised by the US, and another 10% to the death squads linked to them and to the wealthy business sector that the US expects to keep firmly in power. The media meanwhile professed shock at the revelation of what they had chosen to suppress when it mattered. The Clinton Administration responded by establishing a Commission to inquire into this grim history; its mandate was to improve procedures, nothing more, because "We don't want to refight the battles of the 80's. We're not a house-cleaning Adminstration." The Salvadoran government agreed, issuing an amnesty for the killers and torturers in gross violation of the peace accords that established the Truth Commission, which stated that the guilty must be punished, and rejecting the Truth Commission demand that the Supreme Court be dismantled in view of its record of complicity in atrocities.

<P>Immediately after the Truth Commission report appeared, the political party of the killers (Arena), which the US continues to support, held its convention to nominate its candidate for the coming election, Armando Calderon Sol. The party dedicated itself anew to defending the memory of the founder, Roberto d'Aubuisson, one of Central America's great murderers, trained at the School of the Americas, now at Ft. Benning, Georgia. Calderon Sol declared that the party is united "more than ever to defend [d'Aubuisson's] memory," while the convention hall echoed with the Arena theme song, which pledges to make "El Salvador the tomb where the Reds will end up" -- the term "Reds" being understood quite broadly, as events have shown.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In El Salvador too our defense of market democracy has spared its beneficiaries no horror. The Salvadoran government procurator for the defense of children, Victoria de Aviles, recently acknowledged that the "big trade in children in El Salvador" involves not only kidnapping and a gratifying improvement in exports, but also their use "for pornographic videos, for organ transplants, for adoption and for prostitution." Hardly a secret, veteran British Latin America correspondent Hugh O'Shaughnessy observes, recalling his direct observation of an operation of the Salvadoran army in June 1982 near the River Lempa, where the US-trained troops "had a very successful day's baby-hunting," loading their helicopters with 50 babies whose "parents have never seen them since." O'Shaughnessy's report on "Takeaway babies farmed to order" appeared in the London <CITE>Observer</CITE> the same day that the <CITE>Times</CITE> featured Anthony Lake's uplifting and admired remarks on "enlargement" of our traditional mission of mercy and benevolence.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>There is no need to review further how we have "contained a global threat to market democracy" in "our little region over here," as FDR's Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, described the Western hemisphere. It is enough to recall a warning issued by Simon Bolivar in 1822, as he sought to liberate Latin America from Spanish rule: "There is at the head of this great continent a very powerful country, very rich, very warlike, and capable of anything" -- including the evasion of "inconvenient fact."

<P>US power has of course reached far beyond the Western hemisphere. The obvious example that our hypothetical ten year old would look at to evaluate the presupposed higher truth is the Philippines, which has benefited from almost a century of US rule, tutelage, and assistance since its liberation-through-slaughter. The country is situated in the world's leading growth area, in which it remains the sole basket case, very much on the Latin American model. Could that tell us something about our role in advancing market democracy? One could write a revealing article reviewing how the question has been addressed in the respectable literature; a very brief article.

<P>We learn more about our role as "gatekeeper and model" from a World Bank study reported in the London <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> just as the new vision of foreign policy was released here.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></FONT></SUP> The World Bank found that Latin America has "the most unequal income distribution in the world," and predicted "chaos" unless governments "act aggressively against poverty," which is truly appalling in its depth and scale. Why should Latin America win this glorious record too? Another obvious question, lying well beyond the horizons of respectability.

<P>Those interested in an answer might look back to 1945, when the US was setting out on its crusade to "contain the global threat to market democracies" -- or as the senior historian of the CIA puts it, when "the United States assumed, out of self-interest, responsibility for the welfare of the world capitalist system." In "our little region over here," our foreign enemies -- France and Britain -- were to be displaced, so we would have a free hand. That was simple enough, but another problem arose: Latin Americans had not taken the right graduate courses and didn't understand the fundamental principles of economic rationality, which required that their development be "complementary" to the US economy, in accord with the sacred principle of comparative advantage. The Latin American countries advocated what a State Department officer described as "The philosophy of the New Nationalism," which "embraces policies designed to bring about a broader distribution of wealth and to raise the standard of living of the masses." Another State Department expert reported that "Economic nationalism is the common denominator of the new aspirations for industrialization. Latin Americans are convinced that the first beneficiaries of the development of a country's resources should be the people of that country." These mistaken priorities ran directly counter to Washington's plans. The issue came to a head in a February 1945 hemispheric conference, where the US put forth its "Economic Charter of the Americas," which called for an end to economic nationalism "in all its forms." The first beneficiaries of a country's resources must be US investors and their local associates, not "the people of that country." There can be no "broader distribution of wealth" or improvement in "the standard of living of the masses," unless, by unlikely accident, that happens to result from policies designed to serve the interests of those with first priority.

<P>Given US power, economic rationality prevailed, with the consequences that the World Bank now fears. All happily invisible to the triumphalists.

<P>Perhaps something changed in more recent years, say the 1980s, when the yearning for democracy became a leading principle of our foreign policy, right-thinking people know. Instead of rendering my judgment, let me cite that of Reagan insider Thomas Carothers, a State Department official in the Latin American Bureau who "worked on a variety of assistance projects designed to promote democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean," he reports, and has written extensively on the consequences; he has no doubts about the "sincerity" of the efforts, though even his own account suffices to show that they were utterly cynical in conception.

<P>Carothers finds a correlation between US influence and the rise of democracy in the hemisphere: a <I>negative</I> correlation. Where US influence was least, in the southern cone, steps towards democracy took place, opposed by the Reagan Administration, which later hastened to take credit for them. Where US influence was greatest, the effects were worst, in fact far worse than Carothers recognizes given his crabbed conventional conception of "democracy," though he clearly articulates the main point. Washington adopted "prodemocracy policies as a means of relieving pressure for more radical change," he writes, "but inevitably sought only limited, top-down forms of democratic change that did not risk upsetting the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied." Its "impulse is to promote democratic change, but the underlying objective is to maintain the basic order of what, historically at least, are quite undemocratic societies." The US keeps to "very limited, controlled forms of democratic change" because of its "deep fear...of populist-based change in Latin America -- with all its implications for upsetting established economic and political orders and heading off in a leftist direction."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Washington's allies, therefore, are "the existing power structures," not those who work "from the bottom up to spread the ideas and principles of a democratic society among the citizenries." These miscreants, in fact, are the ones left in ditches, tortured and mutilated, dismissed to their proper place by the security forces we train, arm, and advise -- though awareness of that decisive truth is too much to expect.

<P>What of the "global threat" to the "market democracies" we were defending in Latin America? Take Brazil, where US intelligence could find no hint of Soviet intrusion, even if that were imaginable. In fact, in "our little region" there have been no Russians in sight, unless we virtually invited them in. It is perfectly true that targets of US attack sought help from somewhere, and since they were not going to get it from the subordinates of the Enforcer, they ultimately turned to the Russians, who were sometimes willing to help, for their own cynical reasons, in which case the US victims became tentacles of the Evil Empire, whom we must destroy in self-defense.

<P>By similar logic, a Soviet Anthony Lake could have argued that the USSR was defending freedom and democracy in Afghanistan from the "global threat" of American imperialism and its terrorist forces -- who, since liberation from Soviet rule, have been destroying and massacring with great zeal and success, another "inconvenient fact" that merits little notice. There would, for example, be little utility in focusing on the exploits of the CIA favorite Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, one of the world's most extreme Islamic fundamentalist fanatics, who bears primary responsibility for 30,000 deaths in the capital city of Kabul alone according to the London <CITE>Economist,</CITE> surpassing Pol Pot in Phnom Penh, it appears.

<P>Perhaps the "global threat" refers to indigenous Communists. Here there is much to say, including some reflections on the familiar doctrine that democracy requires exclusion of "Communists" from the political system, by violence if necessary. Thus when the US-backed terror regime was doing its work in Iran after the 1953 CIA-MI6 coup that overthrew the conservative parliamentary government, the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> praised the US clients for their "long record of success in defeating subversion without suppressing democracy," noting with pleasure the suppression of the "pro-Soviet Tudeh party," formerly "a real menace" but "considered now to have been completely liquidated," and the "extreme nationalists" who had been almost as subversive as the Communists -- all liquidated without suppressing "democracy." The practice is, again, standard, and passes with little comment, given the prevailing concept of "democracy."

<P>Still more interesting, perhaps, is the way the concept "Communist" is understood. Here the record is voluminous and consistent: to gain the title "Communist," it is enough to work "from the bottom up," appealing to the "poor people" who "have always wanted to plunder the rich," as John Foster Dulles described the plague. That is precisely why the US terror war in Central America, motivated by the "sincere impulse" to bring democracy, was in large measure a war against the Church -- "Communists," in the technical sense, once the Bishops had adopted "the preferential option for the poor." Nothing changes in this regard as new visions replace the old.

<P>The Bush-Clinton approach to Haiti reveals the pattern of continuity with only tactical modifications. The matter requires much more careful treatment, but a close look will show that since the military coup that overthrew President Aristide, the basic goal has been to impose a settlement that will deny more than a figurehead role to the elected President, much disliked in Washington and New York because of his remarkable base of support in popular organizations that threaten to bring about functioning democracy. If Aristide can be returned alive, fine; it will offer opportunities for pieties about our dedication to democracy. But the bottom line is that effective power must remain with the "moderate" and "progressive" sectors of the business classes -- meaning those who do not see massacre and torture as the optimal means to dominate and marginalize the poor majority. In the interests of "democracy," the ruling sectors will have to be "broadened" to include the torturers and murderers as well -- "conservative critics close to the military," as the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> prefers to call them.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></FONT></SUP> No problem, because the military will be professionalized by US trainers, that is, by the same people who have already civilized the top command in Ft. Benning, including those now orchestrating the bloodbath -- facts quietly omitted from the standard resumes.

<P>But the government will not be "broadened" to include the overwhelming majority of the population, who are to be reduced to traditional passivity by the effective use of terror, their organizations decimated and their leaders either killed or placed in remote cubicles. We will then be told that this is the best form of "democracy" for backward peoples lacking our sophistication, democratic culture, civility and respect for others, and our traditions of freedom and justice.

<P>An important fact about our intellectual culture is that people can read and write about our long-term policies of defending market democracy from the Communist threat without laughing. That takes no little talent. It is real tribute to the educational institutions and the information system.

<H3>2. Defending Market Economies</H3>

<P>Let us drop the drivel about our love of democracy and look at the market, thus at least approaching the real world. Recall the one quoted statement of Lincoln Gordon's that does not simply send shivers up the spine: the neo-Nazi triumph should "create a greatly improved climate for private investments," as indeed it did. It is quite true that we seek to impose market discipline on the Third World, now including the large regions of Eastern Europe that are to return to their Third World origins. But the odes to the market are carefully crafted to conceal two important facts. First, market discipline in the Third World is attractive because it will leave the societies open to Western plunder. Second, the wonders of the market are for them, not us, and have always been: every successful developed society, from Britain to the East Asian Tigers and dramatically including the US, gained this status by radical violation of the doctrines we impose on the poor and keeps that status in the same way.

<P>The second prong of the new vision, Clinton's new international economic program, reflects the understanding of these truisms. While Administration rhetoric on the marvels of free trade boomed on the front pages as part of the PR campaign to ram through an unpopular (and in fact, highly protectionist) version of a North American "free trade" agreement (NAFTA), the business sections reported the new National Export Strategy that is to go far beyond the "less coordinated efforts" of Reagan and Bush, with a planned expansion of Export-Import Bank lending, which as the Reaganites had conceded in their day, already violated GATT rules. The Clinton Administration opposes the measures it is implementing, the press reported, because "they amount to government subsidies that distort international markets." But there is no contradiction. As explained by Ex-Im Bank President Kenneth Brody, "by creating such a program in the United States, the Clinton Administration would have more influence in seeking international limits on such lending." The President also approved an independent program that would release $3 billion in loan guarantees to domestic and foreign buyers of US-built ships -- again, for the purpose of inducing others to end such gross interferences in the market, the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> explained.

<P>The logic will be recognized instantly: war brings peace, crime brings law, arms production and sales bring arms reduction and nonproliferation, overthrowing democratic governments brings "showcases for democracy," etc. In simple words, anything goes, as long as there is a good answer to the question: "What is in it for us?"

<P>The simple truths were underscored by Clinton's Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen: "I'm tired of a level playing field," he said: "We should tilt the playing field for U.S. businesses. We should have done it 20 years ago." In fact, "we" (meaning state-corporate power) have been doing it for two centuries, dramatically so in the past 50 years, even more under the Reaganites. But that is the wrong image to convey. It is preferable to speak warmly of Carter-Reagan achievements in moving "toward a defense buildup and less government intervention in the economy" -- Harvard economist and <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> contributing editor Robert Barro, pretending (it has to be a pretense) that he does not know that the Pentagon is, and has been explicitly designed to be, a massive form of government interference in the economy to ensure that high-tech industry feeds at the public trough.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>As I discussed here in February, the Reaganites had forged new paths in violating market orthodoxy for the benefit of US-based corporations, but they did not go far enough to satisfy the business community, one reason for the substantial corporate-financial support for Clinton's program as a New Democrat. And the new programs, like the old, are described in the business press, renowned for its devotion to the needs of working people, as aimed at increasing "jobs," a term that has taken on the meaning of the unpronounceable word "profits" in conventional Newspeak.

<P>The phrase "What is in it for us?" is not mine. I stole it from the third component of the new Clinton vision, the decisions of the White House panel on intervention. The Clinton panel determined to put an end to the era of altruism. No more "nice guy," as in the days when we turned much of the world into graveyards and deserts. Henceforth the guiding consideration will be "What is in it for us?," the words that the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> highlighted in its report.

<P>Thomas Friedman's full report on the new "enlargement" doctrine fills in the picture. The National Security Adviser, he observed, had focused on the fact "that in a world in which the United States no longer has to worry daily about a Soviet nuclear threat, where and how it intervenes abroad is increasingly a matter of choice." That is the "essence" of the new doctrine, Friedman emphasized, a doctrine that clearly and explicitly reflects the understanding that the "nuclear threat" was the Soviet deterrent to US intervention. Now that the deterrent is gone, intervention can be freely undertaken, as had been observed years earlier by others, with the Cold War winding down.

<P>Summarizing, the new vision is that in the international economy, we will no longer be satisfied by a "level playing field" for US corporations, but will construct a proper tilt by violating free trade rules even more thoroughly than before. And with the deterrent gone, we will intervene where and how we choose, though only when there is something in it for us. The technical term for this stance is "the Politics of Meaning," to which the Clintons are said to be sincerely devoted.

<P>Actually, there is nothing new in the new vision, apart from tactical adjustments reflecting new realities of global power. 
The mood of despair in the Third World is easy to understand, quite apart from the catastrophe of global capitalism that has ravaged the traditional colonies. It is captured by a leading Brazilian theologian, Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns of Sao Paulo, Brazil, who observes that throughout the Third World "there is hatred and fear: When will they decide to invade us," and on what pretext? And by Egypt's leading newspaper, the quasi-governmental <I>Al-Ahram</I>, which describes the new world order as "codified international piracy."

<P>Another component of the new vision was leaked to the press as its basic features were being presented in public: a draft report on government secrecy sent to the National Security Council by Clinton's Information Security Oversight Office. The report recommends that classified documents be held for longer than was the practice during the Cold War, apart from the rule of the Reaganite reactionaries, whose commitment to state power and secrecy went far beyond the norm. Their 1982 decision to keep "virtually all [secret government] documents classifed indefinitely" is to be relaxed, AP reported, with restrictions of only up to 40 years, as compared to Nixon's "hold period" of 30 years and Carter's of 20 years. The Clinton task force also recommended slow and extremely costly document-by-document review instead of declassification en masse, and called for "balancing public interest and national security concerns," as determined by "agency officials." The procedure for automatic declassification of certain top secret documents, set at 10 years by Nixon and 6 by Carter, is should be extended to 15 years, the task force proposed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Returning to our attitude towards markets, the doctrinal system has faced unexpected problems among the population, who were expected to sit by in silence and ignorance while the state executives rammed through their secret version of NAFTA, grossly misdescribed as a "free trade agreement." In the light of unanticipated popular opposition, it has been necessary to revive traditional modes of population control.

<P>In earlier years, huge propaganda campaigns had been undertaken to overcome deviant ideas among the general public, notably after World War II, when the world was swept by a current of social reform, bitterly fought by the US government at home and abroad. Success in reversing these trends was great in most of the world, including the United States itself, though in Europe and Japan the attack on labor and democracy did not achieve all of its goals and countries adopted a kind of "social contract" that included such depraved ideas as health care, workers' rights, and other departures from the principles for which we serve as a gatekeeper and a model.

<P>In the US, the wave was beaten back in part through massive propaganda efforts orchestrated by the Chamber of Commerce and the Advertising Council, which conducted a $100 million campaign to use all media to "sell" the American economic system -- as they conceived it -- to the American people. The program was officially described as a "major project of educating the American people about the economic facts of life." Corporations "started extensive programs to indoctrinate employees," the leading business journal <CITE>Fortune</CITE> reported, subjecting their captive audiences to "Courses in Economic Education" and testing them for commitment to the "free enterprise" system -- that is, "Americanism." The scale was "staggering," sociologist Daniel Bell (then a <CITE>Fortune</CITE> editor) observed, as the business world sought to reverse the democratizing thrust of the Depression years and re-establish the ideological hegemony of the "free enterprise system." A survey conducted by the American Management Association (AMA) found that many corporate leaders regarded "propaganda" and "economic education" as synonymous, holding that "We want our people to think right." The AMA reported that Communism, socialism, and particular political parties and unions "are often common targets of such campaigns," which "some employers view...as a sort of `battle of loyalties' with the unions" -- a rather unequal battle, given the resources available, including the corporate media, which offered the services free of charge, then as now.

<P>The results were remarkable, leaving the US off the spectrum of industrial societies on social issues and basic human rights. Health care is one case that finally gained attention, as the highly bureaucratized and inefficient private system began to become too much of a burden to corporations, though the US will remain alone, it seems, in ramming through -- again, over popular opposition -- a system that is highly regressive (not tax-based) and that attends carefully to the needs of the few huge insurance companies that are to take the central management role, at substantial public cost.

<P>We might note that this is characteristic of the "welfare state." A <I>minimally</I> realistic picture of the phenomenon will take into account the fiscal measures designed to benefit the rich, which amount to hefty government welfare payments. Reviewing the scale of these devices, political scientist Christopher Howard points out that "one crucial fact remains: the middle- and upper-income classes are the main beneficiaries of the hidden welfare state." Thus "over 80% of the tax benefits for home mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and real estate taxes go to those earning more than $50,000," not to speak of "the large fraction of tax expenditures that subsidize corporate fringe benefits."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></FONT></SUP> Moving on to a <I>fully</I> realistic conception of the "welfare state," we will also take account of the Pentagon system, export promotion devices, and other measures designed to provide taxpayer subsidies to the wealthy -- to protect "jobs," in standard parlance. The new health reform program is well-crafted to satisfy the conditions of one-sided class warfare that guide policy generally.

<P>On health reform, it has so far been possible to keep the options within a narrow spectrum that excludes the general public, which continues to favor a standard tax-based (single-payer) system by considerable margins, as has been the case from the mid-1940s.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></FONT></SUP> But on "free trade," discipline eroded significantly (not necessarily for good reasons, a different matter). Accordingly, as noted, it was necessary to undertake "population control measures," to adopt some terminology of counterinsurgency literature.

<P>Returning to the traditional methods pioneered by the PR industry, the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> in a front-page story, graciously provided the foolish masses with "A Primer: Why Economists Favor Free-Trade Agreement." Critics of the executive version of NAFTA are declared to be "malicious" liars, with what they say entirely ignored apart from the easy and irrelevant targets. The <CITE>Times</CITE> patiently explains the "fundamental insights" about international trade that have not changed for 250 years, citing the "legendary textbook" in which Paul Samuelson quotes John Stuart Mill as saying that international trade provides "a more efficient employment of the productive forces of the world." Who but a lunatic could oppose that?<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>To be concrete, who but a lunatic could have opposed the development of a textile industry in New England in the early 19th century, when British production was so much more efficient that half the New England industrial sector would have gone bankrupt without very high protective tariffs, thus cutting short industrial development in the United States? Or the high tariffs that radically undermined economic efficiency to allow the United States to develop steel and other manufacturing capacities? Or the gross distortions of the market that created modern electronics? Who could be so silly as to fail to understand that we would be far better off if the US were still pursuing its comparative advantage in exporting furs and crops from stony New England soils, while India produced textiles and ships and, for all we can guess, might have led the way to industrial revolution? Perhaps joined by Egypt, which might not have had to rely on such radical violation of market principles as extermination of the natives and slavery to enable King Cotton to fuel the industrial revolution, as the British and Americans did. And who could be so ridiculous as to contemplate a NAFTA designed to reflect the interests and concerns that are actually articulated by critical voices in all three of the countries to be linked by treaty arrangements?

<P>No reflections on these matters appear in the primer offered to the backward peons.

<P>Thanks to extreme departure from market orthodoxy, things did not pursue the course that economic rationality might have entailed. Thus India, under British rule, deindustrialized, becoming an impoverished agricultural society, while Britain prospered. Egypt's attempt to enter the industrial world was beaten back by British power. The pattern has extended through much of the world, the US taking the lead in the campaign against independent development abroad, and against market discipline at home, as Britain faltered in the task. Today, India, like most of the South, is undergoing neoliberal "structural adjustment" reforms, while the US, as always, violates market principles as it pleases along with the rest of the industrial world, most of it more protectionist than in 1980, the Reaganites often leading the pack in the attack on economic rationality.

<P>There are notable effects, and beneficiaries are not lacking. Take diamonds. Seven out of ten diamonds sold in the West are cut in India, with super-cheap labor, now being driven down to still greater depths of misery thanks to structural adjustment. But there is a bright side: "We pass some of the benefits to our overseas customers," an Indian diamond exporter observes. Workers and their families may starve to death in the New World Order of economic rationality, but diamond necklaces are cheaper in elegant New York shops, thanks to the miracle of the market.

<P>There are also a few highly touted success stories, notably Ghana, "regularly cited by [International Monetary] Fund and [World] Bank economists as the prime example of how structural adjustment cures failing economies and places them on a path to sustainable growth," Ross Hammond and Lisa McGowan point out in a review of this "showcase." Thanks to its obedience to market discipline, Ghana was "showered with foreign aid," including more soft loans from the World Bank than any country except China and India (in absolute, not per capita value). Manufacturing has declined, as have domestic food and livestock, and food self-sufficiency generally. Malnutrition has increased, environmental degradation is proceeding apace, the external debt has tripled, and since 1987, Ghana has paid more to the IMF than it has received -- a standard Third World phenomenon, as the capital hemorrhage from the poor to the rich countries has been joined by capital export to the IMF and Work Bank, now "net recipients of resources from the developing countries," the South Centre (formerly the South Commission) reports in a 1993 study. But there are reasons for IMF and Bank enthusiasm about Ghana. Agroexport has grown, "rich Ghanaians have fared quite well under adjustment" as land ownership and income have concentrated, and Western creditors and investors are doing nicely. The leading success story deserves its reputation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The picture only darkens as we move closer to home, where our benevolence can be exercised more efficiently. Consider Nicaragua, destroyed by US terror and economic warfare, now "challenging Haiti for the unwanted distinction of being the most destitute country in the Western hemisphere," Hugh O'Shaughnessy reports from Managua. Infant mortality has reached the highest level in the continent after a dramatic decline before the effects of the US war set in by the mid-1980s. The UN reports that one-quarter of all children are malnourished. Diseases that had once been almost eliminated are rampant. Women set up street corner soup kitchens "to save tens of thousands of youngsters from starvation." Sandinista health, nutrition, literacy and agrarian programs "have been scrapped by a government pressed by the International Monetary Fund and Washington to privatise and cut public spending." The social fabric is coming apart under severe duress, with rapidly rising crime and violence, as usual directed mainly against the most vulnerable people: rape, for example, is escalating.

<P>"The country's leaders seem to care little," O'Shaughnessy reports, though there is little they can do in the face of the orders from on high. "Finance Minister Emilio Pereira boasts that Nicaragua has the lowest inflation in the western hemisphere -- never mind that its four million people are starving." The far right refuses any compromise, knowing "that it has the support of the US government." "The Central American Foreign Ministers and secretary general of the Organisation of American States, who came on a mission of mediation, left in despair [on Sept. 9] after [right wing elements of the US-backed UNO] refused to join peace talks."

<P>In the countryside, the situation is even worse than in Managua. Contra forces are fighting again in the North, boasting of their Miami suppliers. Others too are mobilized, as desperation is driving peasants to armed combat. In the main cotton producing areas, not an acre was sowed this year because of lack of credits -- though the most powerful producers, including the minister of agriculture and cattle-ranching and the president of the High Council of Private Enterprise, Ramiro Gurdian, received over $40 million in loans last year, <CITE>Barricada Internacional</CITE> reports. Central America specialist Douglas Porpora writes that 70% of what limited credits there are go to "a small number of large export producers," in accord with standard US policies of enriching the wealthy sectors involved in agroexport. Farmers had been driven out of these regions by Somoza, who had taken over the land for cotton export, part of the "economic miracle" hailed in the US, as the economy grew while the population starved. After years of intense pesticide use, much of the soil has lost its fertility. Banana exports and other agricultural production have also collapsed, and sugar mills, including those which had become profitable under government control, are being shut down, apparently in a campaign by the former owners, now restored, to destroy the unions and reverse the gains in workers' rights of the past years.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Despite its victory, the US is not satisfied. Nicaragua's people must suffer much more to atone for the crimes they have committed against us. In October 1993, the IMF and World Bank, virtually US-run, presented new demands of unusual severity. Nicaragua must reduce its debt to zero; eliminate credits from BANIC, one of the remaining state banks; privatize enterprises and government services such as energy and water, to ensure that poor people really feel the pain -- unable to give their children water to drink, for example, if they cannot pay, thanks to zooming unemployment. Nicaragua must cut public expenditures by $60 million, virtually eliminating much of what remains of health and welfare services, while the mounting disaster offers new opportunities to condemn the "economic mismanagement" of the despised enemy.

<P>The $60 million figure was perhaps selected for its symbolic value. Last year the already privatized banks shipped $60 million abroad, following sound economic principles: playing the New York stock market is a far more efficient use of resources than giving credits to poor bean farmers, as any competent student of economics can explain. The bean harvest was lost, a catastrophe for the population. Banks are now to be fully privatized, to ensure the "more efficient employment of the productive forces of the world," with consequences for the population that are evident but that do not enter into calculations of economic rationality, as sophisticates understand.

<P>It is only fair to add that the wonders of the free market have opened up alternatives, not only for rich landowners, speculators, and corporations, but even for the starving children who press their faces against car windows at street corners at night, pleading for a few cents to survive. Describing the miserable plight of Managua's street children, David Werner, the author of <CITE>Where There is No Doctor</CITE> and other books on health and society, writes that "marketing shoe cement to children has become a lucrative business," and imports from multinational suppliers are rising nicely as "shopkeepers in depressed communities do a thriving business with weekly refills of the children's little bottles" for glue-sniffing, said to "take away hunger." The miracle of the market is again at work, maximizing efficient use of resources.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>On Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast, 100,000 people are now starving to death, with aid only from Europe and Canada, Church sources report. Most are Miskito Indians. Nothing was more inspiring than the laments about the Miskitos after a few dozen were killed and many forcibly moved by the Sandinistas in the course of the US terrorist war, a "campaign of virtual genocide" (Reagan), the most "massive" human rights violation in Central America (Jeane Kirkpatrick), far outweighing the slaughter, torture, and mutilation of tens of thousands of people by the neo-Nazi gangsters they were directing and arming, and lauding as stellar democrats, at the very same time -- or the "successful baby-hunting" that foreign reporters observed at exactly that moment. What has happened to the laments, now that 100,000 are starving to death?<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The answer is simplicity itself. Human rights have purely instrumental value in the political culture; they provide a useful tool for propaganda, nothing more. Ten years ago the Miskitos were "worthy victims," in Edward Herman's useful terminology, their suffering attributable to official enemies; now they have joined the vast category of "unworthy victims" whose far worse suffering can be added to our splendid account. What more need be said?

<P>"The United States has a visceral need to annihilate the Sandinistas once and for all," said a foreign affairs expert whom O'Shaughnessy quotes. That was evident years ago, when the refusal of the Sandinistas to genuflect in the expected fashion aroused sheer frenzy. In 1985, one congressman described "the lust that members [of Congress] feel to strike out against Communism" in Nicaragua. Opinion divided between those who called for brutal terror to punish the crime of disobedience, and those on the far left of the respectable spectrum who recommended that we should support terror only if it is "cost-effective" (Michael Kinsley), and if that test fails, we should seek other means to "isolate" the "reprehensible" government in Managua and "leave it to fester in its own juices" (Senate dove Alan Cranston). Nicaragua must be restored to the "regional standards" of our terror states, Tom Wicker and other media doves declared with passion. Nor will the US rest until the military is under Washington's control, with consequences that are familiar throughout the continent, a crucial element of US policy towards Latin America for 50 years, emphasized with particular force by the Kennedy intellectuals. 

<P>Nicaragua's efforts to pursue the peaceful means required by international law aroused particular fury. In 1984, senior US government officials demanded that an invitation to Daniel Ortega to visit Los Angeles be withdrawn "to punish Mr. Ortega and the Sandinistas for accepting the Contadora peace proposal," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reported without comment, referring to peace efforts that the US government was able to undermine. The World Court condemnation of the US evoked further tantrums. Washington's threats finally compelled Nicaragua to withdraw the claims for reparations awarded by the Court, after a US-Nicaragua agreement "aimed at enhancing economic, commercial and technical development to the maximum extent possible," Nicaragua's agent informed the Court. The withdrawal of just claims for billions of dollars of reparations having been achieved by force, Washington abrogated the agreement, suspending its trickle of aid with demands of increasing depravity and gall.

<P>The imperial arrogance is most impressive. Having been condemned by the World Court for the "unlawful use of force" against Nicaragua in a campaign of wholesale international terrorism that no other actor in the world scene could hope to approach, we now demand righteously that Nicaragua prove to <I>us</I> that it is not engaged in terrorism. Any further aid is conditioned on this proof, the Senate voted. And having helped to destroy the country and its people prior to the terrorist war, we now demand that the beneficiaries of those wonderful years receive properties and reparations. In September 1993, while the new foreign policy vision was taking its final form, the Senate voted 94-4 to ban any aid if Nicaragua fails to return or give adequate compensation (as determined by Washington) for properties of US citizens seized when Somoza fell -- assets of US participants in the crushing of the beasts of burden by the tyrant who had long been a US favorite. Voting against were Paul Wellstone (D-MN), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Paul Simon (D-IL), Russell Feingold (D-WI). In October, Senator Christopher Dodd, a leading Senate dove, visited Managua to ensure that these orders are fully understood.

<P>Nothing will satisfy the lust to punish the transgressors, even their reduction to Haitian standards. Any mafia don would understand. If someone on your turf fails to pay protection money, you don't just give him a black eye. Others have to learn the lesson. The world must come to understand what virtually limitless power will achieve if offended in any way -- the lesson that Bolivar sought to impart. Accordingly, the treatment is uniform, extending to Vietnamese, Cubans, Iraqi children, indeed anyone who doesn't understand the rules of the world for which we are the gatekeeper and the model.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<H3>3. Demystification</H3>

A major qualification has to be added to everything said so far. I have been adopting the standard mystification that nations are actors in world affairs, nonsense of course. In any "really existing state," power is sharply skewed; those who hold it use the state to defend their interests, whatever the impact on others at home or abroad, a truism emphasized by that noted revolutionary Marxist Adam Smith, among many others.

<P>Demystifying, all looks different. Who lost War II? Certainly not German and Japanese industrialists who dedicated themselves to the fascist cause, and were quickly restored to power and wealth by the conquering armies. Who won? Certainly not the anti-fascist resistance, which was dispersed or decimated by the military victors. Who lost the Cold War? Surely not the reigning Communist <I>nomenklatura</I>, now the leaders of <I>nomenklatura</I> capitalism -- "a parasitical new robber-baron class of speculators and mafiosi," as Soviet scholar Robert Daniels calls them, with wealth beyond their wildest dreams. Surely not the tough Communist Party boss of Sverdlovsk, Boris Yeltsin, now elevated to the rank of leading democrat as he reverses Russia's democratic gains from 1989, highly praised by Western governments and press -- and by financial markets -- because of his commitment to the "market shock" that is expected to "create a greatly improved climate for private investments." Or his old subordinates from the CP apparatus, now staffing his bureaucracy. Who won the Cold War? Not the huge mass of the populations controlled by Western power sectors, neither in the former colonial domains nor at home; nor the common people of the East, now learning anew the lessons of their history as Third World subjects.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A true history will depart radically from standard formulas.

<P>In Adam Smith's day, the "principal architects" of policy, who saw to it that their interests were "most peculiarly attended to," were "merchants and manufacturers." The world has changed since, quite considerably in just the last 20 years, in part as a result of Richard Nixon's dismantling of the post-World War II (Bretton Woods) international economic system. One consequence of these major changes in world order has been a huge increase in unregulated capital. The World Bank currently estimates the total resources of international financial institutions at about $14 trillion. Not only can European central banks not defend national currencies in the face of this unprecedented private power, but the European Monetary System has "effectively collapsed" as EC governments "have experienced the power of today's free-wheeling global capital markets," the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> reports in a review of the world economy and finance. The huge and unregulated international capital market controls access to capital, but "global investors impose a price. If a country's economic policies are not attractive to them" they will use their power to induce changes. Such pressures may not be "fatal" to the very rich, but for the South, the international capital market is "no more than an unacceptable arm of economic imperialism," which governments cannot resist in an era when even in the rich countries, governments "are on the defensive and global investors have gained the upper hand."

<P>A related development is the dramatic shift in use of capital resources. Cambridge University economist John Eatwell notes the striking fact that "In 1971, just before the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system, about 90 percent of all foreign exchange transactions were for the finance of trade and long-term investment, and only about 10 percent were speculative.

<P>Today those percentages are reversed, with well over 90 percent of all transactions being speculative. Daily speculative flows now regularly exceed the combined foreign exchange reserves of all the G-7 governments," the richest seven. One consequence is that "economic performance in the 1970s and 1980s has been poor throughout the industrial nations of the OECD," with growth in each G-7 country about half that of the 1960s, unemployment at least doubled, and productivity growth in manufacturing industry sharply down. Furthermore, "the sheer scale of speculative flows can easily overwhelm any government's foreign-exchange reserves," as just noted. National economic planning is increasingly difficult even for the rich, market instability is increasing, and governments are driven to deflationary policies to preserve market "credibility," driving economies "toward a low-growth, high-unemployment equilibrium," with declining real wages and increasing poverty and inequality.

<P>A third related development has been the sharpening of the double-edged conception of the market: fetters for the weak, to be thrown aside at their pleasure by the strong. During the past 20 years, free market rhetoric has soared to glorious heights, while the rich countries have enhanced their protections against market discipline. GATT economist Patrick Low draws attention to "the sustained assault on [free trade] principle from which the GATT suffered, starting around the early 1970s," a "difficult period economically" until today, in which "the GATT did not fully succeed in holding the line against growing protectionism and systematic decline" -- to put it mildly. Again, the Reaganites combined the two tendencies quite brilliantly, orating in free market voices to the poor while assuring the rich, loud and clear, that the state will intervene massively to protect their interests. Secretary of the Treasury James Baker "proudly proclaimed that Mr Ronald Reagan had `granted more import relief to US industry than any of his predecessors in more than half a century'," international economist Fred Bergsten points out, adding that the Reaganites specialized in the kind of "managed trade" that most "restricts trade and closes markets," voluntary export restraint agreements -- "the most insidious form of protectionism," which "raises prices, reduces competition and reinforces cartel behaviour." The increase in the Pentagon budget alone is a major form of state intervention in the economy for the benefit of the rich, and has been understood just that way for half a century -- one reason why there will be a long wait for a "peace dividend."

<P>A fourth related development has been the rapid acceleration of the internationalization of the economy. Foreign sales of Transnational corporations (TNCs) now far exceed all of world trade -- and of what is called "world trade," well over a third is now estimated to be intrafirm transactions, centrally managed interchanges within corporations that happen to cross an international border -- one of many reasons why talk about "free trade" and "markets" is of limited relevance to the real world.

<P>An obvious corollary is the sharp decline in meaningful democracy discussed before in these pages (see, e.g., Edward Herman, "The End of Democracy?," <CITE>Z</CITE> September), as extreme totalitarian institutions (corporations, banks, investment firms, etc.), with strict top-down control, internal secrecy, and only the most limited public accountability gain even further power on a global scale. Naturally they are constructing organs of governance to reflect their interests (GATT, the IMF and World Bank, the EC executive, G-7 closed sessions, etc.), all properly insulated from popular interference, even awareness, a new and higher stage in the long struggle to remove any threat to "top-down" forms of democracy that enhance "the traditional structures of power with which the United States has long been allied" -- eliminating mystification, "the traditional structures of power" with which the "principal architects" of US government policy and the interests they serve have "long been allied."

<P>The consequences are not hard to see or understand: slowdown in economic growth, decline in economic or other planning in the interests of the general population, and extension of the Third World model to the rich countries themselves as the domestic population becomes superfluous for profit-making, the supreme human value in the world for which we are "the gatekeeper and the model."

<P>The US and Britain have been leading the way in these developments, and their accomplishments are welcomed by those who matter. While the new Clinton vision was receiving its final touches, a front-page story in the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reported "a welcome development of transcendent importance," no less: "the increasingly competitive cost of U.S. labor." Thanks to the harsh attack on labor through a combination of state power and improved opportunities to shift production abroad, US labor costs per unit output fell 1.5% in 1992, while costs increased in Japan and Europe, as well as Taiwan and South Korea. In 1985, hourly pay in the US was higher than the other G-7 countries. By 1992, it had fallen to below its wealthy competitors, apart from England, where Thatcher had done even better in punishing working people. Hourly wages were 60% higher in Germany than in the US, 20% higher in Italy. The US has not yet reached South Korea and Taiwan, but progress is being made, in the richest country in the world, with unparalleled advantages -- and a highly class conscious business community, fighting a bitter class war against an enemy lacking resources, organization, and meaningful modes of interaction or participation.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The lessons are spelled out by <CITE>Business Week.</CITE> Europe must "hammer away at high wages and corporate taxes, short working hours, labor immobility, and luxurious social programs." It must learn the lesson of Britain, which finally "is doing something well," the <CITE>Economist</CITE> announces approvingly, with "trade unions shackled by law and subdued," "unemployment high," and the Maastricht social chapter rejected so that employers are protected "from over-regulation and under-flexibility of labour" (job security). American workers are barely a step behind.

<P>The end of the Cold War offers new weapons for use against working people in the rich societies. There are "green shoots in Communism's ruins," exults the world's leading business daily, the London <CITE>Financial Times;</CITE> not everything is grim in the former Communist world. The "green shoots" are the new opportunities for corporations to reduce costs thanks to "rising unemployment and pauperisation of large sections of the industrial working class" as capitalist reforms are instituted. GM opened a $690 million assembly plant in East Germany, where workers are willing to "work longer hours than their pampered colleagues in western Germany" at 40% of the wage and with few benefits, the journal relates happily. Poland is still better, with workers available at 10% the wage of the pampered Western workers, kept that way "thanks largely to the Polish government's tougher policy on labour disputes," that is, repression of labor.

<P>Of course, the term "markets" has its usual meaning. GM purchased an auto plant near Warsaw, economist Alice Amsden comments, "on the under-the-table condition that the Polish government provide it with 30 percent tariff protection" -- the usual form that "free market" enthusiasms take. Tax holidays for investors are also offered, among other gifts.

<P>The same is true when our own growing Third World seeks to entice foreign investors. Alabama recently beat out competitors for a new Daimler-Benz plant for which its population "will pay dearly," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> noted a few days after the Clinton economic strategy was announced. Germany's leading conglomerate paid a royal $100 for the plant site, and has been offered a package of tax breaks valued at over $300 million, along with other publicly-funded services. Alabama "has a Third World economy," the head of an economic development group observes: "They're losing money to invest in their people, their roads, their state in general," as the market performs its miracles. The traditional Third World can explain to us how it works.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The prospects are inspiring. Canadian social benefits and workers' rights can be attacked through "free trade," which forces harmonization downwards to US standards. The same device can be used to "lock the United States into a low-wage, low-productivity future," the congressional Office of Technology Assessment concludes in its review of the executive version of NAFTA, scrupulously designed to protect rights of investors, not workers or future generations (the environment). And an increase in standard of living for Mexican workers is not a serious threat, given harsh dictatorial rule and the flooding of the labor market as peasants are driven from the land by US agribusiness exports. German workers had become "used to some of the best working conditions on earth," <CITE>Business Week</CITE> comments under the heading "Time to Leave the Cocoon?" But no more, as some "60% of German industrial jobs are threatened by competition from Eastern Europe, Asia, and the U.S.," the last now offering its contribution to the ranks of the Third World thanks to "the welcome development of transcendent importance." With these "green shoots" rising in old and new Third Worlds, Germany's biggest employers' federation, Gesamtmetall, was able to issue a "declaration of war," cancelling "union wage and vacation contracts -- for the first time ever." Meanwhile profits should do just fine, as the world moves towards the desired two-tiered model under its new visions.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In brief, the developments of the past years offer new ways to put the screws on the overwhelming majority of the population both abroad <I>and</I> at home, options enhanced by the end of the Cold War -- which is why the Cold War victors are celebrating so triumphantly: investors, executives, and wealthy professionals at home; the former Communist Party rulers now joining in the global rip-off; their counterparts in the traditional South; and, of course, respectable sectors of the educated communities, who are called upon to trumpet the "victory for a set of political and economic principles: democracy and the free market." The Clinton vision merely announces another small step towards the same ends.

<P>How far can this go? Will it really be possible to construct an international society on something like the Third World model, with islands of great privilege in a sea of misery -- fairly large islands, in the richer countries -- and with controls of a totalitarian nature within democratic forms that increasingly become a facade? Or will popular resistance, which must itself become internationalized to succeed, be able to dismantle these evolving structures of violence and domination, and carry forth the centuries-old process of expansion of freedom, justice, and democracy that is now being aborted, even reversed? These are the large questions for the future.

<P>On August 30, the Israeli Cabinet approved a draft agreement on "Palestinian self-rule" that had been reached by the government of Israel and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's personal representatives. Parts of the agreement have not been revealed or are not yet settled at the time of writing (September 2), but it is likely that something much like the published text (<CITE>NYT,</CITE> Sept. 1) will be instituted, and that it will be followed by separate agreements between Israel and Arab states.

<P>To understand what has been achieved, it is necessary to recall the relevant background, much of it familiar to readers of this journal, at least.

<P>The June 1967 war brought the superpowers perilously close to confrontation, driving home the importance of a diplomatic settlement. In November 1967, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 242, which expressed a broad international consensus on the general terms for a settlement. The current agreement is based entirely on UN 242 (and 338, which endorses it). Article I of the 1993 draft agreement, outlining the "Aim of the Negotiations," specifies that "the negotiations on the permanent status will lead to the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338"; no other UN Resolutions are mentioned, thus resolving a central issue in the controversy in accord with US-Israeli demands.

<P>UN 242 "emphasiz[es] the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every state in the area can live in security." It calls for "Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict" and "Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every state in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force." It calls for an agreement among <I>states;</I> Palestinian rights are mentioned only in the call for "a just settlement of the refugee problem," left unspecified. UN 242 is therefore thoroughly <I>rejectionist,</I> if we understand the concept of rejectionism in nonracist terms: as denial of the right to national self-determination of <I>one or the other</I> of the two contending parties in the former Palestine. 

<P>With varying degrees of ambiguity, UN 242 was accepted by the contending states of the region over the next few years, though their interpretations differed. The Arab states rejected full peace, Israel rejected full withdrawal.

<P>The phrase "withdrawal from territories" has been a particular bone of contention. In most of the world (including Europe), it has been understood to imply Israeli withdrawal from <I>all</I> of the territories occupied during the war, with at most minor -- and mutual -- adjustments. At first, that was also Washington's interpretation. UN Ambassador Arthur Goldberg informed King Hussein of Jordan that the US insisted that "there must be a mutuality in adjustments," a classified State Department history observes: to both Israel and the Arab states, "U.S. officials emphasized that any territorial adjustments would be limited in nature and would not, of necessity, be detrimental to the Arab states"; there would be at most "minor reciprocal border rectifications" with no "substantial withdrawing of the [pre-war] map." It was on this understanding, explicitly conveyed by US government mediators, that the Arab states accepted the resolution, and the US itself unequivocally held to this interpretation until 1971. In those years, Israel was alone among major actors in rejecting this interpretation of the document.

<P>The disagreements over interpretation came to a head in February 1971, when UN mediator Gunnar Jarring presented a proposal to Egypt and Israel that called for full peace between them in return for full Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory. Egyptian President Sadat accepted the proposal. Sadat's acceptance of Jarring's "famous" peace proposal was a "bombshell," Prime Minister Rabin recalls in his memoirs, a "milestone." While officially welcoming Egypt's expression "of its readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel," the government of Israel rejected the agreement, stating that "Israel will not withdraw to the pre-June 5, 1967 lines. The reasoning was explained by Haim Bar-Lev of the governing Labor Party: "I think that we could obtain a peace settlement on the basis of the earlier [pre-June 1967] borders. If I were persuaded that this is the maximum that we might obtain, I would say: agreed. But I think that it is not the maximum. I think that if we continue to hold out, we will obtain more."

<P>The crucial question was how Washington would react. The Jarring-Sadat agreement was consistent with official US policy. There was, however, a conflict between the State Department and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, who was then engaged in a campaign to undermine and displace Secretary of State Rogers, as he was soon to do. Kissinger insisted that the US must insist upon "stalemate": no diplomacy, no negotiations. His position prevailed, and Sadat's peace offer was rejected.

<P>Since 1971, the US and Israel have been virtually alone in rejecting the standard interpretation of the withdrawal clause of UN 242. The basic cause for the misery and suffering that followed is their conviction, which has proven to be correct, that "if we continue to hold out, we will obtain more." The isolation of the US and Israel became still more marked by the mid-1970s, when the terms of the international consensus shifted to include a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, thus departing from earlier rejectionism. In January 1976, the US vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for a settlement in terms of UN 242, with this amendment. The US veto, repeated later, excluded the Security Council from the diplomacy. The General Assembly continued to pass near-unanimous resolutions in similar terms (the US and Israel opposed); a negative US vote amounts to a veto. The US also blocked initiatives from Europe, the Arab states, the PLO and others. The last of the regular UN resolutions was in the midst of the Gulf conflict, in December 1990 (144-2).

<P>Through this period, the US and Israel were the leaders of the rejectionist camp, joined by increasingly marginal elements of the Islamic world, justly termed "extremist." The conclusions being unacceptable, the facts have been "vetoed" along with numerous peace initiatives, buried deep in the memory hole together with Sadat's "famous milestone" and much else that is inconvenient.

<P>Israel's policy spectrum with regard to the occupied territories is illuminated in a study by Peace Now, which compares four different plans for the territories from 1968 to 1992, asking how many Palestinians would be within areas annexed by Israel if these plans were enacted today: (I) the 1968 Allon Plan (Labor); (II) the 1976 Labor Party Settlement Plan (never officially adopted though "it has informed practical decision-making and action"); (III) the Ariel Sharon Plan of 1992 (Likud), which created eleven isolated and discontinuous "cantons" for Palestinian autonomy; (IV) the Defense Establishment Plan of 1992 (Labor), which deals only with the West Bank. The number of Palestinians in settlements to be annexed are as follows:

<OL>
<LI>Allon Plan: 385,000, 91,000 in the West Bank and the rest in Gaza
<LI>Labor Party Settlement Plan: 603,000, 310,000 in the West Bank
<LI>Sharon Plan: 393,000, 378,000 in the West Bank
<LI>Defense Establishment Plan: 204,000 in the West Bank, Gaza unspecified
</OL>

<P>To these figures must be added the 150,000 Palestinians of East Jerusalem, to be annexed in all plans, the Peace Now study notes.
"The Labor Party plan of 1976 would annex the greatest number of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza," while the Sharon Plan "is the maximalist plan with regard to the West Bank," though ceding self-rule to more Gaza Palestinians than the Labor plans.

<P>As the analysis indicates, the policy spectrum has been narrow, and invariably rejectionist. The political blocs have differed on West Bank Arab population concentrations, Labor being more concerned than Likud to exclude them from areas scheduled for Israeli takeover. Washington has favored Labor Party rejectionism, more rational than the Likud variety, which has no real provision for the population of the occupied territories except eventual "transfer" (expulsion).

<P>After the Gulf war, Europe accepted the US position that the Monroe Doctrine effectively extends over the Middle East; Europeans would henceforth refrain from independent initiatives, limiting themselves to helping implement US rejectionist doctrine, as Norway indeed did in 1993. The Soviet Union was gone from the scene, its remnants now loyal clients of Washington. The UN had become virtually a US agency. Whatever space the superpower conflict had left for nonalignment was gone, and the catastrophe of capitalism that swept the traditional colonial domains of the West in the 1980s left the Third World mired in general despair, disciplined by forces of the managed market. With Arab nationalism dealt yet another crushing blow by Saddam's aggression and terror and PLO tactics of more than the usual ineptitude, the Arab rulers had less need than before to respond to popular pressures with pro-Palestinian gestures. The US was therefore in a good position to advance its rejectionist program without interference, moving towards the solution outlined by Secretary of State James Baker well before the Gulf crisis: any settlement must be based on the 1989 plan of the government of Israel, which flatly bars Palestinian national rights (Baker Plan, December 1989).

<P>Washington's general goals have been stable for a long period. 
The basic concern is the enormous oil wealth of the region. 
Planning has long been guided by a strategic conception that assigns local management to an "Arab Facade" of weak and dependent dictators, who will ensure that profits from Gulf oil flow primarily to the US (and its British client), not to the people of the region. A network of regional gendarmes is to keep order; local "cops on the beat" as Nixon's Defense Secretary, Melvin Laird, described them in the context of the Nixon Doctrine. The responsibility of the Middle East cops was outlined in 1973 by the Senate's leading expert on the topic, Henry Jackson: to "inhibit and contain those irresponsible and radical elements in certain Arab States...who, were they free to do so, would pose a grave threat indeed to our principal sources of petroleum in the Persian Gulf" -- more accurately, to the vast wealth they yield. Senator Jackson was referring specifically to the tacit alliance between Israel, Iran (under the Shah), and Saudi Arabia.

<P>As for Kurds, Palestinians, slum-dwellers in Cairo, and others who contribute nothing to the basic structure of power -- they have no rights, by the most elementary principles of statecraft. 
Perhaps they can occasionally be used in one or another power play, but that is where their rights end, as the history of the Kurds has demonstrated, today once again. The status of the Palestinians has been even lower than that of other worthless people; their value is not zero, but negative, in that their plight has had a disruptive effect in the Arab world, thus interfering with US goals. They must therefore be marginalized somehow, perhaps under a form of "autonomy" that leaves them to manage their own affairs under Israeli supervision. That plan, proposed at Camp David, was taken up when the "peace process" was renewed at Madrid in the Fall of 1991. As the conference opened, one of Israel's most knowledgeable and acute observers of the territories, journalist Danny Rubinstein, wrote that the US and Israel were proposing "autonomy as in a POW camp, where the prisoners are `autonomous' to cook their meals without interference and to organize cultural events." Palestinians are to be granted little more control over local services, he wrote, adding that even advocates of Greater Israel never call for literal annexation of the territories, which would require Israel to provide the "restricted services" available to Israel's second-class Arab citizens, at enormous cost.

<P>As discussed here at the time, the best outcome, from Washington's point of view, would be a settlement that entrenches the traditional strategic conception and gives it a public form, raising tacit understandings to a formal treaty. If some arrangement for local "autonomy" can suppress the Palestinian issue, well and good. Meanwhile security arrangements among Israel, Turkey, Egypt and the United States can be extended, perhaps bringing others in if they accept the client role. There need be no further concern over possible Soviet support for attempts within the region to interfere with such designs.

<P>While the negotiations were proceeding without issue, Israel stepped up the harsh repression in the territories, following the thinking outlined by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin (now Prime Minister). In February 1989, he explained to Peace Now leaders that the US had granted Israel time to suppress the Intifada by force, diverting attention by meaningless diplomatic maneuvers: "The inhabitants of the territories are subject to harsh military and economic pressure," Rabin said: "in the end, they will be broken" and will accept Israel's terms. These policies achieved much success, extended with Rabin's recent "closure" of the territories, a crushing blow to the staggering Palestinian economy.

<P>From the early days of the Intifada, if not before, it was becoming clear that the PLO leadership was losing its popular support in the occupied territories. Local activists from secular nationalist sectors, while still recognizing the PLO as the sole agent for negotiations, spoke with open contempt of its corruption, personal power plays, opportunism, and disregard for the interests and opinions of the people it claimed to represent.

<P>By all indications, the disaffection increased in the years that followed, while the fundamentalist opposition that Israel had initially nurtured gained popular support, feeding on this growing discontent and on the demoralization as Rabin's program was implemented, with constant US support at all levels: economic, diplomatic, and ideological.

<P>These matters, reviewed with particular detail and depth in Israel Shahak's regular reports, have received only sporadic and inadequate coverage here.

<P>With its popular support in decline and its status deteriorating in the Arab world, the PLO became more tolerable to US-Israeli policymakers, particularly as the growing fundamentalist movement evoked memories of the resistance that had driven Israel out of much of Lebanon. Informal Israel-PLO contacts were increasingly reported. These reached their culmination with the August 1993 agreement, which bypassed the delegations engaged in the official "peace process," and indeed also excluded the PLO, apart from Arafat and a few close associates. 

<P>The agreement was welcomed with great acclaim, marred only by skepticism as to whether it could hold. "America's own greatest interest," the twin goals of "enhanced security for Israel and regional peace," both...seem closer to achievement this morning than ever before," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> editors observed as the agreement was announced. Apart from omission of the tacit background understanding that the "regional peace" must ensure US control, their identification of Washington's highest priorities is accurate, though automatic identification of US government policy with "America's greatest interest" takes a leap of faith; it is not obvious that ignoring Palestinian national rights and the security of others is in the interest of the people of the United States.

<P>The editors may, however, be right in thinking that long-standing US policy goals have been advanced. The intended eventual outcome of the 1993 agreement falls well within the bounds of traditional US-Israeli rejectionism, adopting essential features of the Sharon Plan as well as the Labor Party's Allon Plan. That much was spelled out the same day on the facing page of the <CITE>Times</CITE> by Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin, a close associate of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. He informed his US audience that

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"the permanent solution will be based on Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and from most of the West Bank. We agree to a confederated formula between Jordan and the Palestinians in the West Bank, but we will not return to pre-1967 borders. United Jerusalem will remain the capital of the State of Israel."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In return, "After years of rejection of Israel as part of the Middle East, the Arabs will accept and recognize Israel's right to exist as a sovereign state within secure and defined borders in this region" -- as they did, for example, in the vetoed Security Council resolution of January 1976, gone from history along with much else like it, so that Beilin's statement will ring true to American ears.

<P>The reasons for preferring "confederation" to Palestinian independence have nothing to do with security. As has been understood since 1948, when Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion made the point explicit, an independent Palestinian state serves Israeli security interests better than "a state linked to Transjordan [now Jordan], and maybe tomorrow to Iraq." The problem is that an independent state would be a barrier to eventual integration of parts of the territories and control of their resources, primarily water. As for "united Jerusalem," that is a concept of broad and as yet undetermined scope.
"Withdrawal from Gaza" and other territories is understood to exclude Jewish settlements and the resources they control. And even this "permanent settlement" lies well down the road.

<P>It is understandable, then, that the <CITE>Times</CITE> editors, expressing the prevailing view, should see the "historic deal" as a great opportunity. It is "the Middle East equivalent of the fall of the Berlin wall," chief diplomatic correspondent Thomas Friedman proclaimed. The projected arrangements represent the "triumph of realism over fanaticism and political courage over political cowardice." "Realists" understand that in this world, you follow US orders. Those who are not convinced of the justice of traditional US-Israeli rejectionism are not only wrong, but are "fanatics" and "cowards," thus excluded from respectable society. The hysteria of the rhetoric suggests that more is understood than appears on the surface.

<P>While some Israeli advocates in the US felt that the victory was not far-reaching enough, more perceptive ones recognized the scale of what had been achieved. The PLO had been forced "to become more reasonable," acceding to Israel's demands, as <CITE>Times</CITE> columnist William Safire, a self-described "pro-Israeli hawk," put the matter. "Arafat finally appears to be ready to accept [Menahem] Begin's approach [of 1978], adding the Gaza-Jericho twist," Safire comments, "having been softened by 15 years of Israeli hard line" -- to which we may add US intransigence.

<P>The draft agreement makes no mention of Palestinian <I>national</I> rights, the primary issue on which the US and Israel broke with the international consensus from the mid-1970s. Throughout these years, it was agreed that a settlement should be based on UN 242.

<P>There were two basic points of contention: (1) Do we interpret the withdrawal clause of 242 in accord with the international consensus (including the US, pre-1971), or in accord with the position of Israel and US policy from 1971? (2) Is the settlement based <I>solely</I> on UN 242, which offers nothing to the Palestinians, or 242 <I>and other relevant UN resolutions,</I> as the PLO had proposed for many years in accord with the nonrejectionist international consensus. Thus, does the settlement incorporate the right of refugees to return or compensation, as the UN has insisted since December 1948 (with US endorsement, long forgotten), and the Palestinian right to national self-determination that has repeatedly been endorsed by the UN (though blocked by Washington)? These are the crucial issues that have stood in the way of a political settlement.

<P>On these issues, the agreement explicitly and without equivocation adopts the US-Israeli stand. As noted, Article I states that the "permanent status will lead to the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338," nothing more. Furthermore, as Beilin made explicit, the withdrawal clause of UN 242 is to be understood in the terms unilaterally imposed by the US (from 1971). In fact, the agreement does not even preclude further Israeli settlement in the large areas of the West Bank it has taken over, or even new land takeovers. On such central matters as control of water, it speaks only of "cooperation" and "equitable utilization" in a manner to be determined by "experts from both sides." The outcome of cooperation between an elephant and a fly is not hard to predict.

<P>The victory of the rejectionists is complete, even in the ideological sphere; given US global power, the version of history designed by its doctrinal institutions becomes the general framework for discussion in most of the world, including Europe.

<P>For Palestinians in refugee camps and elsewhere outside the territories, the agreement offers little hope, and they have expressed understandable bitterness. Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon also "criticized the PLO for making concessions with Israel that could jeopardize Palestinian national rights and undermine the joint Arab negotiating strategy," Lamis Andoni reported from Amman, giving "Israel the upper hand in imposing its conditions on each Arab country separately."

<P>A separate matter entirely is whether the two sides would be well-advised to accept the agreement devised by Israel and Arafat. For the US and Israel, the question hardly arises: the agreement falls within the framework on which they have insisted.

<P>For the Palestinians, the question is more complex. The agreement entails abandonment of most of their hopes, at least for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, realistic alternatives may be much worse.

<P>Given US power, refusal to accept US-Israeli terms is at once translated into a demonstration of the worthlessness of such "fanatics" and "cowards," who thereby cede any rights they might have been thought to have. Palestinians were once "the darling of many Western liberals," Thomas Friedman writes (meaning, presumably, that some Western liberals regarded them as at least semi-human); but they are beloved no more, and unless they toe the line their former admirers may abandon them to their fate. Furthermore, the agreement should offer Palestinians some relief from the barriers to development imposed by the military administration, no small matter. And it moves beyond Rubinstein's "autonomy of a POW camp" in that Palestinians are assigned control over "direct taxation." An Israeli-supervised "strong police force" of Palestinians might, at worst, be the local counterpart of Israel's South Lebanon Army, subduing the population by terror and threat while the masters observe closely, ready to move if the iron fist is needed. But it might turn out that Palestinian police will treat the population less harshly than the Israeli army and border police, and settler depredations should reduce. Though the agreements say nothing about the matter, there may be a decline in Israeli settlement and in the development programs designed to integrate the extensive areas designated for Jewish settlement into the Israeli economy, leaving Palestinians on the side. Many issues can be debated, but not -- at least not seriously -- within a doctrinal framework that identifies "realism" as what the US and Israel demand, and dismisses critical analysis in advance as "fanaticism" and "cowardice."

<P>The respected head of the Palestinian delegation, Haidar Abdul Shafi, had some observations on these matters in a talk in Bethlehem on July 22, 1993, just as Arafat was secretly moving to take matters into his own hands, bypassing local Palestinians. Abdul Shafi held out little hope for the "peace process," which excludes entirely the possibility "that Palestinians must be the main authority in the interim period for the people and for the land," leading to true national self-determination. He stressed, however, that

"the negotiations are not worth fighting about. The critical issue is transforming our society. All else is inconsequential... We must decide amongst ourselves to use all our strength and resources to develop our collective leadership and the democratic institutions which will achieve our goals and guide us in the future... The important thing is for us to take care of our internal situation and to organize our society and correct those negative aspects from which it has been suffering for generations and which is the main reason for our losses against our foes."

<H1>"Limited War" in Lebanon</H1>
<P>Noam Chomsky<BR>
<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> September 1993
</CENTER>

<P>On July 25, Israel launched what the press described as its "biggest military assault on Lebanon" since the 1982 invasion. The assault was provoked by guerrilla attacks on Israeli troops in southern Lebanon, killing seven Israeli soldiers. By the time a US-arranged cease fire took hold on July 31, about 125 Lebanese were reported killed, along with three Syrians and three Israelis, one a soldier in southern Lebanon, while about 500,000 people were driven from their homes according to reports from Lebanon.

<P>Journalists in Lebanon reported that 90 percent of the 80,000 inhabitants of Tyre joined the flood of refugees northwards. Villages were deserted, with many casualties and destruction of civilian dwellings by intensive bombardment. Nabatiye, with a population of 60,000, was described as "a ghost town" by a Lebanese reporter a day after the attack was launched. Inhabitants described the bombings as even more intense and destructive than during the Israeli invasions of 1978 and 1982. Those who had not fled were running out of food and water but were trapped in their villages, Mark Nicolson reported from Nabatiye in the <CITE>Financial Times,</CITE> because "any visible movement inside or outside their houses is likely to attract the attention of Israeli artillery spotters, who...were pounding shells repeatedly and devastatingly into selected houses." Artillery shells were hitting some villages at a rate of more than 10 rounds a minute at times, he reported, while Israeli jets roared overhead, and in nearby Sidon, "the main Hammoud hospital was admitting new casualties every 15 minutes by late afternoon" of July 27. An Israeli Army spokesperson said that "70 percent of the village of Jibshit is totally destroyed, its inhabitants will not recognize it." The goal is "to wipe the villages from the face of the earth," a senior officer added. In Tripoli, 40 miles north of Beirut, a Palestinian refugee camp was attacked by Israeli planes firing missiles. Israeli naval forces bombarded coastal areas near Beirut and intercepted vessels approaching Lebanese ports, though whether they also resumed their long-term practice of kidnapping and killing passengers on the high seas is not reported.

<P>Israel and the UN observer force (UNIFIL) estimate that there were 300-400 active guerrillas in south Lebanon, from the Iranian-backed Hizbollah (Party of God). Eight were reported killed by Lebanese sources. The reasons for the attack were stated at once by Israel's chief of staff, General Ehud Barak. As reported by Boston Globe correspondent Ethan Bronner, "Barak said a pattern had emerged that Israel considered intolerable: Every time Hizbollah attacked an Israeli or pro-Israeli position inside the security zone, Israel would fire back at the attackers north of the zone. Then, the attackers would lob rockets at civilians in northern Israel rather than at military targets inside the zone as in the past."

<P>The "security zone" is a region of southern Lebanon that Israel has occupied in one or another form since its 1978 invasion. In recent years, it has been held by a terrorist mercenary army (the South Lebanon Army of General Lahd) backed by Israeli military forces. Any indigenous resistance to the rule of israel and its proxies is considered "terrorism," which Israel has a right to counter by attacking Lebanon as it chooses (retaliation, preemption, or whatever) -- what General Barak chooses to call "firing back at the attackers." But the resistance has no right to retaliate by shelling northern Israel. These are the rules; one goal of Israel's July attack was to enforce them.

<P>The US government agrees that these are to be the operative rules, while occasionally expressing qualms about the tactics used to enforce them -- meanwhile providing a huge flow of arms and any required diplomatic support. Given Washington's stand, it follows that the rules are unchallengeable background assumptions, merely presupposed in reporting and commentary. It is unnecessary to ask what the reaction would be if any state not enjoying Washington's favor were to carry out comparable atrocities, in gross violation of international law and the UN Charter, were such trivialities considered relevant.

<P>On July 30, Hizbollah announced that rocket attacks on northern Israel could only end "with the complete and permanent halt of aggression against villages and civilians and the stopping of Israeli attacks from air, land and sea on all Lebanese territory." The statement "received a testy response in Jerusalem," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reported. Reviewing the Lebanese operation, the Cabinet did not even consider the Hizbollah proposal, the spokesperson for the Rabin government said. That is understandable. The rules are that Israel is allowed to strike "villages and civilians" at will, anywhere, if its occupying forces are attacked in southern Lebanon. Since these rules are also accepted by Washington, the Hizbollah statement was dismissed here as well.

<P>Secretary of State Warren Christopher was highly praised by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin for arranging the cease-fire, which, according to Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, satisfied all of Israel's demands, imposing its rules, thus granting the expected rewards for "benign aggression," the category that is acceptable to the world ruler. The Israeli leaders informed the press "that the US-brokered deal included an understanding that Israel and the southern Lebanese militia it sponsors would continue to operate freely inside Israel's so-called security zone" in southern Lebanon, while rocketing of northern Israel will cease (Bronner). There must be "quiet, I stress, on both sides of the border," Rabin emphasized, referring to the "security zone." "The status of the security zone has not changed," Peres added, "and if they try to plot against our forces there, or the South Lebanon Army forces there, we will take measures against them." The meaning is clear. The new "understandings" permit Israel to carry out military operations at will anywhere in Lebanon, as in the past, if it perceives "plots" against its mercenary forces or its own military rule. The tacit assumption, surely, is that in such an eventuality, Israel will receive at worst a tap on the wrist accompanied with a new flow of weapons.

<P>The occupation is in violation of UN Security Council resolution 425 of March 1978, calling on Israel to withdraw immediately and unconditionally from Lebanon. The government of Lebanon has reiterated this demand, notably in February 1991 during the Gulf conflict; apart from odd corners like this journal, the request was drowned out by the self-congratulatory oratory about the wondrous new order of law and justice. Israel is free to ignore such minor annoyances as the Security Council and international law thanks to the stance of its superpower patron, which is powerful enough to reduce the UN to an instrument of its foreign policy and to shape international law as it chooses, as was seen once again in the ludicrous legal arguments put forth to justify Clinton's bombing of Iraq in June.

<P>For the same reason, Israel is free to reject the concept of "terrorism" held by the international community, but rejected by the United States. The concept is spelled out in the major UN General Assembly Resolution on terrorism (42/159, December 7, 1987). which condemns international terrorism and outlines measures to combat the crime, with one proviso: "that nothing in the present resolution could in any way prejudice the right to self-determination, freedom and independence, as derived from the Charter of the United Nations, of peoples forcibly deprived of that right..., particularly peoples under colonial and racist regimes and foreign occupation or other forms of colonial domination, nor...the right of these peoples to struggle to this end and to seek and receive support [in accordance with the Charter and other principles of international law]." The Resolution passed 153-2, US and Israel opposed, Honduras alone abstaining. Naturally, Washington denies any right to resist the terror and oppression imposed by its clients.

<P>US rejection of a General Assembly Resolution amounts to a veto, and suffices to remove the issue from the realm of articulate opinion, which reflexively adopts the US government position as axiomatic. Accordingly, when the PLO endorsed all UN resolutions on terrorism, Yasser Arafat was: denounced with derision across the spectrum for his evasiveness on terror and his failure to repeat George Shultz's "magic words" with appropriate humility; as Shultz now reports in his much acclaimed apologia, <CITE>Turmoil and Triumph,</CITE> he told Reagan in December 1988 that Arafat was saying in one place " `Unc, unc, unc,' and in another he was saying, `cle, cle, cle,' but nowhere will he yet bring himself to say `Uncle'," in the style expected of the lesser breeds.

<P>Similarly, no one within the culture of respectability could dream of questioning the doctrine that Iran's support for resistance against foreign occupation, in accord with the Charter and the near-unanimous Resolution on terrorism, is still further evidence that it is a terrorist state -- though Washington's support for the illegal military occupation and its violence within and beyond does not suggest that the US is a terrorist state.

<P> The Logic of Terror   At the outset of the operation, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin informed the Israeli parliament "that he planned to flood Beirut with refugees to press the Lebanese government to end the attacks," the <CITE>Times</CITE> reported: "He said Israel would continue to blast villages as long as Katyusha rockets slammed into Israeli settlement towns in Galilee" -- in retaliation against Israeli attacks on civilian targets in Lebanon to counter guerilla attacks in the "security zone." Israel's plan, Army spokesperson Michael Vromen stated, was to "create pressure on the Lebanese government [to rein in the Hizbollah guerrillas] by having as many refugees as possible gathered around Beirut." The "limited war" is "a noisy, frightening `message' in the words of officials [in Tel Aviv] that the south will be uninhabitable unless Hizbollah is stopped" (Ethan Bronner). "We believe that the Lebanese government of Rafik Hariri, which has been promising order and stability in Lebanon, will not allow this kind of chaos to continue for very long," a senior Israeli official explained: "Between the population of the south, the Lebanese government and the Syrians, we are hoping Hizbollah will be stopped." As the cease-fire was announced, Rabin stated that one of the goals of the operation, now achieved, had been "the use of firepower to create conditions to allow understandings with the power brokers who influence the terrorist organizations in Lebanon."

<P>A broader goal was outlined by Uri Lubrani, Israel's coordinator of Lebanese policy. The purpose of the attack, he said, is to induce the Lebanese government to demand Syrian permission to negotiate directly with Israel. "This is an attempt to drive home a point," Lubrani said. "Lebanese government, you claim you want to exercise authority over all of Lebanese territory. You want us to take you seriously in your negotiations. Go to your masters [in Damascus] and tell them: 'Let me decide on my own fate'." According to this conception, Israel is advancing the "peace process" by attacking Lebanon. That is entirely reasonable, if we understand the "peace process" to be a program for imposing US-Israeli dominance over the region by a mixture of violence and diplomacy with a gun visibly cocked -- as we should.

<P>Doubtless Lebanon should be free from the Syrian domination that was backed by George Bush as part of the payoff for Syria's participation in his Gulf war. But by US-Israeli logic, Syria should have the right to make much of Israel uninhabitable by intensive bombardment, driving hundreds of thousands of refugees to Tel Aviv, to impose its demands, including the demand that Israel observe UN Security Council resolutions, among them, the Council's order that Israel withdraw from Lebanon and rescind its effective annexation of Syria's Golan Heights. That has yet to be advocated here.

<P>Lubrani's analysis was confirmed by Shimon Peres, describing the "achievement" of the Israeli operations as they ended. Previously, he said, Lebanon had not accepted Israel's "suggestion" that it negotiate separately with Israel; now the "suggestion" is taken more seriously. Predictably, both he and Rabin argued that Israel's violence had promoted the peace process, not only by driving a wedge between Lebanon and Syria but also by opening channels for further negotiations Israeli officials elaborated. It follows that Israel should next bomb Amman, thus contributing to peace by separating Jordan from the other Arab parties and opening new channels of communication as the US moves to terminate the assault by imposing Israel's demands.

<P>Naturally, Israel has always preferred separate arrangements with much weaker neighbors who will succumb to its threats, leaving the Palestinians in the lurch, along with Arab states whose territory Israel occupies (in this case, Syria).

<P>Lubrani was Israel's de facto Ambassador to Iran under the Shah, then a leading figure in the sale of US arms to Iran via Israel that began immediately after the Shah was overthrown. The purpose of this project, he explained publicly in 1982, was to establish contact with elements of the Iranian military who were "determined, ruthless, cruel, ...emotionally geared to the possibility that they'd have to kill ten thousand people." Such a force could take over Teheran, he said, and restore the Israeli-Iranian alliance. A long-time Labor Party functionary, Lubrani has lost none of the qualities that have endeared the Party to left-liberal opinion for many years.

<P>Israeli military officials confirmed yet another motive: to adjoin to the "security zone" a broad strip of land to its north that will be a no-man's land where Israel can strike freely. In this way, Israel can extend "the area of Lebanon it controls without having to commit ground troops, a move that would be unpopular with the Israeli public," Julian Ozanne reports, noting that the pattern of bombardment also reveals these objectives. Arab officials and press commentary suggest further motives, Lamis Andoni reports: to pressure Syria to accept Israel's plans for the Golan Heights, and to focus regional and international attention against Iran, a major current policy objective, as is not obscure (see <CITE>Z magazine,</CITE> June). She also reports that "Contrary to the Western view that Hizbollah and its Iranian backers provoked the violence to sabotage the peace process, Arabs argue that Israel has used the incident as a cover to achieve its goals in Lebanon and to pressure Syria to accept its terms for peace."

<P>The "Western view" -- more accurately, Washington's -- is adopted reflexively in US reporting and commentary, with the rarest of exceptions, the usual pattern. Thus it is simply a Fact, requiring no discussion or argument, that Hizbollah "started the latest round of fighting in an effort to sabotage the peace negotiations and provoke a wider conflict" (<CITE>New York Times</CITE> Middle East specialist Elaine Sciolino). Or if one prefers, it is a Fact that Syria, "seeking to remind everyone that Damascus is the source of all peace and war in the region, encouraged its Party of God proxies to fire scores of rockets into northern Israel." (<CITE>Times</CITE> chief diplomatic correspondent Thomas Friedman, omitting a few relevant stages). It could not be that the guerrillas who were mobilized by Israeli aggression and terror, as all concede, had some other interest: say, to drive the occupying army out of their country and disperse its terrorist mercenaries.

<H3>Shadows of the Past</H3>

<P>To appreciate more fully what is happening, some historical background is useful. Israel's 1978 invasion killed several thousand Lebanese and Palestinians, drove hundreds of thousands to the north, and left a region of the south under the control of a murderous proxy force, Major Haddad's militia. Haddad's forces were responsible for many atrocities, reported in Israel but not here, one of the most notorious being the massacre of all remaining inhabitants of the Lebanese town of Khiam during Israel's 1978 invasion; the population had been reduced from 30,000 to 32 by Israeli bombing in earlier years. During its 1982 invasion, Israel selected Khiam as the site of its notorious Ansar I prison camp, used since to punish people suspected of anti-Israel activity in Lebanon, or their relatives, thus to undermine any resistance to the South Lebanon Army. There is ample evidence of hideous conditions and savage torture, reported by the press in Israel and England, but not authenticated by the Red Cross or any humanitarian organization because Israel refuses to allow any access to the horror chamber run by its proxies under its supervision.

<P>The 1978 invasion was presented as retaliation for a Palestinian terrorist attack, which originated far north of the zone Israel invaded. In earlier years there had been a pattern of cross-border attacks by the PLO from Lebanon into Israel (called "terrorism") and by Israel into Lebanon (called "retaliation"). The scale was radically different, reflecting the force available to the attackers and their susceptibility to international reaction. Diplomats and UN officials in Beirut estimated about 3,500 killed in Israeli raids in the early 1970s, along with unknown numbers of Palestinian civilians, with hundreds of thousands fleeing what was, in effect, a scorched earth policy carried out with US support and equipment. PLO actions, some of them atrocious acts of terror, took a vastly lesser toll.

<P>Often Israel's terrorist operations lacked any pretense of retaliation. Thus in February 1973, Israeli airborne and amphibious forces attacked Tripoli in northern Lebanon, killing 31 people (mainly civilians) and destroying classrooms, clinics, and other buildings in a raid justified as preemptive. In December 1975, Israeli warplanes bombed and strafed Palestinian refugee camps and nearby villages, killing over 50 people, while "Israeli officials stressed that the purpose of the action had been preventive, not punitive," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reported. That particular attack, arguably, was indeed retaliation: against the United Nations, which, two days earlier, had arranged for the PLO to participate in a session to consider a proposal for a two-state settlement advanced by the PLO and the Arab states, supported by the world generally, angrily denounced by Israel, and vetoed by the US -- hence out of history, like other unacceptable facts. One of the targets was Nabatiye, again emptied today. Nabatiye was a frequent target, including an attack in early November 1977, when the town was heavily shelled, with no provocation, by Israeli batteries on both sides of the border and Israeli-supported Lebanese Maronite forces; in the ensuing exchange, over 70 people were killed, almost all Lebanese. Egyptian President Sadat cited this Israeli-initiated exchange, which threatened to lead to a major war, as a reason for his offer to visit Jerusalem a few days later. By the time Israel invaded in 1978, Nabatiye's population of 60,000 had been reduced to 5,000, the remainder having fled "mostly from fear of the [Israeli] shelling," the <CITE>Jerusalem Post</CITE> reported. Others fared similarly.

<P>As PLO cross-border terror declined in the mid- 1970s, Israel intensified its own terror in Lebanon, with US compliance and media silence, for the most part. Hundreds more civilians were killed in Israeli attacks after the 1978 invasion, almost 1,000 by August 1979, the Lebanese government reported. ln July 1981, Israel once again violated a cease-fire, attacking civilian targets in Lebanon. Palestinian retaliation elicited heavy Israeli bombing. Some 450 Arabs -- nearly all Lebanese civilians -- were reported killed, along with six Jews. From these events, all that remains in historical memory in the US is the scene of Jewish civilians huddling in bomb shelters under attack from PLO terrorists and their Katyushas.

<P>The US mediated a cease-fire, "and after mid-1981 the Lebanese-Israeli border was quiet," William Quandt -- a well-known Middle East expert and NSC staffer during the Nixon and Carter administrations -- writes in his history of the "peace process." Quandt's version is the standard one. The "border was quiet" in the sense that the PLO adhered to the cease-fire rigorously while Israel continued its violations: bombing and killing civilians, sinking fishing boats, violating Lebanese air space thousands of times, and carrying out other provocations designed to elicit some PLO reaction that could be used as a pretext for the planned invasion. The border was "quiet" because the crossborder terror was all Israeli, and only Arabs were being killed.

<P>The occasional reports here reflected the common understanding. Thus in April 1982, Israel bombed alleged PLO centers south of Beirut, killing two dozen people, in retaliation for what it called a PLO "terrorist act": an Israeli soldier had been killed when his jeep struck a land-mine in illegally-occupied southern Lebanon. The <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> sagely observed that "this is not the moment for sermons to Israel. It is a moment for respect for Israel's anguish -- and for mourning the latest victims of Israeli-Palestinian hostility." Typically, it is Israel's anguish that we must respect when still more Arabs are murdered by Israeli terror, and are thus to be seen as victims of mutual hostility, no agent indicated.

<P>The same attitudes prevail today. H.D.S. Greenway of the Boston Globe, who reported the 1978 invasion graphically, now writes that "If shelling Lebanese villages, even at the cost of lives, and driving civilian refugees north would secure Israel's border, weaken Hizbollah, and promote peace, I would say go to it, as would many Arabs and Israelis. But history has not been kind to Israeli adventures in Lebanon. They have solved very little and have almost always caused more problems," so the murder of civilians, expulsion of hundreds of thousand of refugees, and devastation of the south is a dubious proposition. Can one imagine an article recommending a murderous and destructive attack on Israel, if only it could secure Lebanon's border and promote peace?

<P>Having failed to elicit the desired PLO reaction, Israel simply manufactured a pretext for its long-planned invasion of June 1982, claiming that it was in retaliation for an attempt to assassinate the Israeli Ambassador to London; the attempt, as Israel was aware, was carried out by the terrorist Abu Nidal organization that had been at war with the PLO for years and did not so much as have an office in Lebanon.

<P>The official line in the US has been that "Operation Peace for Galilee -- the Israeli invasion of Lebanon -- was originally undertaken" to protect the civilian population from Palestinian gunners, and that "the rocket and shelling attacks on Israel's northern border" were ended by the operation, though "If rockets again rain down on Israel's northern border after all that has been expended on Lebanon, the Israeli public will be outraged" (Thomas Friedman, <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> January-February 1985). This is plainly nonsense, given the history, which is not challenged. Since it is now recognized that the rockets still rain down, the story has been modified: "Israel's two military forays into Lebanon [1978, 1982] were military disasters that failed to provide long-term security for Israel's northern border" (Elaine Sciolino, July 27, 1993). Security had been at risk only as a result of Israel's unprovoked attacks from 1981, and to a large extent before. The phrase "military disaster" does not refer to the killing of some 20,000 Lebanese and Palestinians in 1982, overwhelmingly civilians, the destruction of much of southern Lebanon and the capital city of Beirut, or the terrible atrocities carried out by Israeli troops through the mid-1980s; rather, to Israel's failure to impose the "new order" it had proclaimed for Lebanon, and its inability to maintain its occupation in full because of the casualties caused by unanticipated resistance ("terror"), forcing it back to its "security zone."

<P>The actual reasons for the 1982 invasion have never been concealed in Israel, though they are rated "X" here. A few weeks after the invasion began, Israel's leading academic specialist on the Palestinians, Yehoshua Porath, pointed out that the decision to invade "flowed from the very fact that the cease-fire had been observed" by the PLO, a "veritable catastrophe" for the Israeli government because ir endangered the policy of evading a political settlement. The PLO was gaining respectability thanks to its preference for negotiations over terror. The Israeli government's hope, therefore, was to compel "the stricken PLO" to "return to its earlier terrorism," thus "undercutting the danger" of negotiations. As Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir later stated, Israel went to war because there was "a terrible danger.... Not so much a military one as a political one." The invasion was intended to "undermine the position of the moderates within [the PLO] ranks" and thus to block" the PLO `peace offensive'" and "to halt [the PLO's] rise to political respectability" (strategic analyst Avner Yaniv); it should be called "the war to safeguard the occupation of the West Bank," having been motivated by Begin's "fear of the momentum of the peace process," according to Israeli Arabist and former head of military intelligence Gen.  Yehoshaphat Harkabi. US backing for Israel's aggression, including veto of Security Council efforts to stop the slaughter, was presumably based on the same reasoning.

<P>The thinking behind Israel's terrorist operations in Lebanon is also no secret. It was outlined, for example, by the respected former Foreign Minister Abba Eban, considered a leading dove. He was responding to a review by Menahem Begin of atrocities against civilians carried out by the Labor governments in which Eban served, a picture, according to Eban, "of an Israel wantonly inflicting every possible measure of death and anguish on civilian populations in a mood reminiscent of regimes which neither Mr. Begin nor I would dare to mention by name." Eban does not contest the facts, but criticizes Begin for revealing them. He also explains the reasons for Israel's wanton attacks: "there was a rational prospect, ultimately fulfilled, that affected populations would exert pressure for the cessation of hostilities."

<P>In short, the civilian populations were to be held hostage under the threat and exercise of extreme violence, until they compel their governments to accept Israeli plans for the region. As we have seen, the current assault is quite frankly predicated on the same "rational prospect."

<P>As for the civilian toll, the basic thinking goes back to the founding fathers. In a January 1, 1948 diary entry, David Ben-Gurion wrote: "What is necessary is cruel and strong reactions. We need precision in time, place and casualties. If we know the family -- [we must] strike mercilessly, women and children included. Otherwise the reaction is inefficient. At the place of action there is no need to distinguish between guilty and innocent. Where there was no attack -- we should not strike." The qualifications were quickly dropped, by Ben-Gurion in particular, and by now have long been forgotten. Talk of "purity of arms" or the "benign occupation" is disgraceful apologetics, as widely recognized by now within Israel.

<H3>Safeguarding the Occupation</H3>

<P>Harkabi's description of the 1982 invasion a "the war to safeguard the occupation of the West Bank" might be applied to Israel's July 1993 attack as well, though the intentions of the Labor government and its US sponsor are not quite those of the Likud government of 1982. The latter called for extension of Israeli sovereignty over the occupied territories, though not annexation, the distinction being left vague. The Labor government, in contrast, calls for "territorial compromise," its traditional position from the "Allon plan" of 1968.

<P>The descendants of this plan vary somewhat in manner of implementation, though the principles remain stable. Israel is to maintain control over the resources and usable land of the territories, including a wide and growing region called "Jerusalem." Much of the indigenous population, which lacks national rights, will eventually find its way to existing Arab states ("transfer"), as the leading figures of the Zionist movement always hoped and intended, while those who remain will either be administered by Jordan, or allowed to run their own local affairs. Israel will proceed with its plans for settling and exploiting the territories, maintaining effective overall control. Questions remain about just how to deal with the Golan Heights, and over the disposition of Gaza, which has become such a hellhole under Israeli occupation that there are now thoughts of abandoning it -- which means virtual destruction under current conditions. The Arab states are to accept Israeli arrangements and enter into a full peace treaty. The general project is entitled "land for peace" or "territorial compromise."

<P>Pursuing the project, Israel proceeds with its programs of expansion and integration of the territories, now helped by US loan guarantees in addition to the traditional huge subsidies, which have no remote analogue in international affairs; the $10 billion loan guarantees, demanded with much passion for Russian immigrants who were being forced to Israel by pressures on Germany, the US, and others not to allow them a free choice, are now being used for infrastructure and business investment, it is frankly conceded -- of course freeing funds for settlement in the territories. And while Jewish settlement flourishes and expands, the Palestinian inhabitants of the occupied territories sink into misery and despair, the decline sharply accelerated by Rabin's closure of the territories, which threatens even survival in a region that has been denied any possibility of independent development under the cruel military occupation. The "closure," of course, observes the usual racist criteria: Jewish settlers in the territories are exempt.

<P>The July 1993 operations are intended to advance all of these prospects, making it clear to the Arab states and Palestinians that they have no choice but to yield to the force exercised by Israel under US protection. All other possibilities have been eliminated in the New World Order, in which there is no deterrent to US force, no space for independent initiatives ("neutralism," "nonalignment"), no annoying impediments from international institutions, and no thought of a European role in what is recognized to be US turf.

<P>Israel may well consider that these opportunities are now enhanced. The Clinton administration is regarded as even more extreme in rejection of Palestinian rights than the government of Israel itself. Two weeks before the latest Israeli attacks, the political correspondent of Hadashot, Amnon Barzilai, observed that the US proposals presented to Israel and the Palestinians break new ground in rejectionism: for the first time, they stipulate that "all the options will be left open," including even "the demand for full annexation of the territories" under "Israeli sovereignty." In this respect, Clinton goes far beyond the governing Labor Party, "which never demanded that all the options be kept open," insisting rather on "territorial compromise." The US initiative can only "strengthen the suspicion among the Palestinians that there is reason to fear an Israeli conspiracy with American support," though in reality, neither the United States nor the Israeli political blocs, Labor or Likud, would consider true annexation of the territories with the enormous costs that would entail, such as extending at least minimal social, economic, and political rights to their inhabitants.

<P>US policy has always been strictly rejectionist, similar to that of Hizbollah, except that Washington denies national rights to Palestinians, not Jews. Again, the modalities have varied over the years, though basic assumptions have been stable, as has the doctrinal framework: thus, Washington is invariably seeking peace and justice, pursuing the "peace process," a term of newspeak that refers to Washington's efforts to impose its own rejectionist goals, excluding all diplomatic initiatives that conflict with them. In its recent version, the "peace process" has been based on the Baker-Shamir-Peres consensus of 1989, which barred any "additional Palestinian state in the Gaza district and in the area between Israel and Jordan" (Jordan already being a "Palestinian state") or any negotiations with the PLO, and declared that "There will be no change in the status of Judea, Samaria and Gaza other than in accordance with the basic guidelines of the Government" of Israel, which reject Palestinian self-determination. With these "basic principles" in place, there are to be "free elections" under Israeli military occupation to yield "autonomy" -- what Israeli journalist Danny Rubinstein, who has been covering the occupied territories with distinction for years, calls "the autonomy of a POW camp."

<P>In the aftermath of the Gulf conflict, there were new opportunities for advancing this project as well as new urgency in pursuing it. The opportunities derived from the forceful assertion of unilateral US power over the region, the demoralization of the Arab world (and the Third World generally), the abdication of Europe. and the collapse of the Soviet Union, leaving Russia as an even more loyal client than Britain, perhaps. The urgency arose from the need to concoct some "triumph" to conceal the disastrous consequences of the US-UK war in the Gulf, with Saddam firmly in power cheerfully slaughtering Shiites and Kurds while Stormin' Norman and the heroic George Bush stood quietly aside, US corporations were beginning to rake in huge contracts for reconstruction of the ruins, and "an excess of more than 46,900 children died [in Iraq] between January and August 1991" from the effects of the war and the sanctions, according to a study conducted by leading US and foreign medical specialists reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, far more since.

<P>Something had to be done. Accordingly, a new "peace initiative" was declared with much fanfare amidst praise for the noble President who "has made very clear that he wants to breathe light into that hypothetical creature, the Middle East peace process" (Anthony Lewis). The story since should surprise no one who looked beyond the impressive chorus of self-praise to the not-very-obscure facts (see <CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> October, December, 1991).

<P>The US still remains committed to the "peace process" it initiated, not surprisingly, given its framework. We therefore have even more powerful reasons for recognizing that "this is not the moment for sermons to Israel," rather for "respect for Israel's anguish -- and for mourning the latest victims of Israel-Palestinian hostility." Sermons -- let alone any other reaction -- would only impede the "peace process." Indeed the "peace process," apologists argue, has been advanced by Rabin's violence, not only for the powerful reasons given by Israeli authorities but also because it enables Rabin to fend off criticism from the right as he strides towards "territorial compromise."

<P>Rabin's assault on Lebanon is thus much like Clinton's bombing of Iraq a month earlier in retaliation for an alleged threat to assassinate a former US leader, a crime so heinous that our pure sensibility can scarcely even imagine how it could be conceived by some distorted and primitive mind. Clinton's brave act, we were informed, relieved the fears that the old draft dodger might be less prone to violence than his predecessors, and refuted the dangerous belief that "American foreign policy in the post-Cold War era was destined to be forever hogtied by the constraints of multilateralism" (<CITE>Washington Post</CITE>) -- that is, by international law and the UN Charter.

<H3>1. "The Current Crisis in the Middle East"</H3>

<P>For some time, I've been compelled to arrange speaking engagements long in advance. Sometimes a title is requested for a talk scheduled several years ahead. There is, I've found, one title that always works: "The current crisis in the Middle East." One can't predict exactly what the crisis will be far down the road, but that there will be one is a fairly safe prediction. That will continue to be the case as long as basic problems of the region are not addressed.

<P>Furthermore, the crises will be serious in what President Eisenhower called "the most strategically important area in the world." In the early post-War years, the US in effect extended the Monroe Doctrine to the Middle East, barring any interference apart from Britain, assumed to be a loyal dependency, and quickly punished when it occasionally got out of hand (as in 1956). The strategic importance of the region lies primarily in its immense petroleum reserves and the global power accorded by control over them; and, crucially, from the huge profits that flow to the Anglo-American rulers, which have been of critical importance for their economies. It has been necessary to insure that this enormous wealth flows primarily to the West, not to the people of the region. That is one fundamental problem that will continue to cause unrest and disorder. Another is the Israel-Arab conflict with its many ramifications, which have been closely related to the major US strategic goal of dominating the region's resources and wealth.

<P>For many years, it was claimed the core problem was Soviet subversion and expansionism, the reflexive justification for virtually all policies since the Bolshevik takeover in Russia in 1917. That pretext having vanished, it is now quietly conceded by the White House (March 1990) that in past years, the "threats to our interests" in the Middle East "could not be laid at the Kremlin's door"; the doctrinal system has yet to adjust fully to the new requirements. "In the future, we expect that non-Soviet threats to [our] interests will command even greater attention," the White House continued in its annual plea to Congress for a huge military budget. In reality, the "threat to our interests," in the Middle East as elsewhere, had always been indigenous nationalism, a fact stressed in internal documents and sometimes publicly.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A "worst case" prediction for the crisis a few years ahead would be a war between the US and Iran; unlikely, but not impossible. Israel is pressing very hard for such a confrontation, recognizing Iran to be the most serious military threat that it faces. So far, the US is playing a somewhat different game in its relations to Iran; accordingly, a potential war, and the necessity for it, is not a major topic in the media and journals of opinion here.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The US is, of course, concerned over Iranian power. That is one reason why the US turned to active support for Iraq in the late stages of the Iraq-Iran war, with a decisive effect on the outcome, and why Washington continued its active courtship of Saddam Hussein until he interfered with US plans for the region in August 1990. US concerns over Iranian power were also reflected in the decision to support Saddam's murderous assault against the Shi'ite population of southern Iraq in March 1991, immediately after the fighting stopped. A narrow reason was fear that Iran, a Shi'ite state, might exert influence over Iraqi Shi'ites. A more general reason was the threat to "stability" that a successful popular revolution might pose: to translate to English, the threat that it might inspire democratizing tendencies that would undermine the array of dictatorships that the US relies on to control the people of the region.

<P>Recall that Washington's support for its former friend was more than tacit; the US military command even denied rebelling Iraqi officers access to captured Iraqi equipment as the slaughter of the Shi'ite population proceeded under Stormin' Norman's steely gaze.

<P>Similar concerns arose as Saddam turned to crushing the Kurdish rebellion in the North. In Israel, commentators from the Chief of Staff to political analysts and Knesset members, across a very broad political spectrum, openly advocated support for Saddam's atrocities, on the grounds that an independent Kurdistan might create a Syria-Kurd-Iran territorial link that would be a serious threat to Israel. When US records are released in the distant future, we might discover that the White House harbored similar thoughts, which delayed even token gestures to block the crushing of Kurdish resistance until Washington was compelled to act by a public that had been aroused by media coverage of the suffering of the Kurds, recognizably Aryan and portrayed quite differently from the southern Shi'ites, who suffered a far worse fate, but were only dirty Arabs.

<P>In passing, we may note that the character of US-UK concern for the Kurds is readily determined not only by the timing of the support, and the earlier cynical treatment of Iraqi Kurds, but also by the reaction to Turkey's massive atrocities against its Kurdish population right through the Gulf crisis. These were scarcely reported here in the mainstream in virtue of the need to support the President, who had lauded his Turkish colleague as "a protector of peace" joining those who "stand up for civilized values around the world" against Saddam Hussein. But Europe was less disciplined. We therefore read, in the London <CITE>Financial Times,</CITE> that "Turkey's western allies were rarely comfortable explaining to their public why they condoned Ankara's heavy-handed repression of its own Kurdish minority while the west offered support to the Kurds in Iraq," not a serious PR problem here. "Diplomats now say that, more than any other issue, the sight of Kurds fighting Kurds [last fall] has served to change the way that western public opinion views the Kurdish cause." In short, we can breathe a sigh of relief: cynicism triumphs, and the Western powers can continue to condone the harsh repression of Kurds by the "protector of peace" while shedding crocodile tears over their treatment by the (current) enemy.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Israel's reasons for trying to stir up a US confrontation with Iran, and "Islamic fundamentalism" generally, are easy to understand. The Israeli military recognizes that, apart from resort to nuclear weapons, there is little they can do to confront Iranian power, and are concerned that after the (anticipated) collapse of the US-run "peace process," a Syria-Iran axis may be a significant threat. The US, in contrast, appears to be seeking a long-term accommodation to "moderate" (that is, pro-US) elements in Iran, and a return to something like the arrangements that prevailed under the Shah. How these tendencies may evolve is unclear.

<P>The propaganda campaign about "Islamic fundamentalism" has its farcical elements -- even putting aside the fact that US culture compares with Iran in its religious fundamentalism. The most extreme Islamic fundamentalist state in the world is the loyal US ally Saudi Arabia, or to be more precise, the family dictatorship that serves as the "Arab facade" behind which the US effectively controls the Arabian peninsula, to borrow the terms of British colonial rule. The West has no problems with Islamic fundamentalism there. Probably the most fanatic Islamic fundamentalist group in the world is led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the terrorist extremist who has been the CIA favorite and prime recipient of the $3.3 billion in (official) US aid given to the Afghan rebels (with roughly the same amount reported from Saudi Arabia), the man who has recently been shelling Kabul with thousands killed, driving hundreds of thousands of people out of the city (including all Western Embassies), in an effort to shoot his way into power; not quite the same as Pol Pot emptying Phnom Penh, since the US client has been far more bloody in that operation.

<P>Similarly, it is not at all concealed in Israel that its invasion of Lebanon in 1982 was undertaken in part to destroy the secular nationalism of the PLO, which was becoming a real nuisance with its persistent call for a peaceful diplomatic settlement, which was undermining the US-Israeli strategy of gradual integration of the occupied territories within Israel. One result was the creation of Hizbollah, an Iranian-backed fundamentalist group that drove Israel out of most of Lebanon. For similar reasons, Israel supported fundamentalist elements as a rival to the accommodationist PLO in the occupied territories. The results are similar to Lebanon, as Hamas attacks against the Israeli military become increasingly difficult to contain. The examples illustrate the typical brilliance of intelligence operations when they have to deal with populations, not simply various gangsters. The basic reasoning goes back to the early days of Zionism: Palestinian moderates pose the most dangerous threat to the goal of avoiding any political settlement until facts are established to which it will have to conform.

<P>In brief, Islamic fundamentalism is an enemy only when it is "out of control." In that case, it falls into the category of "radical nationalism" or "ultranationalism," more generally, of independence whether religious or secular, right or left, military or civilian; priests who preach the "preferential option for the poor" in Central America, to mention a recent case.

<H3>2. "Terror's senseless logic"</H3>

<P>A lesser potential crisis is the initiation of terrorist activities within US borders. As recognized at once, the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York on February 26, which killed 6 people and caused great damage, may be a portent of things to come. Many questions arise about that terrorist act. Let us put them aside for the moment, and take the official accounts at face value. There are, then, two contrasting interpretations of this event. The first interpretation was expressed in the huge media coverage, which struck a single chord; the second in a letter attributed to the perpetrators.

<P>News reports and commentary were so uniform as to make extensive sampling superfluous. "Americans Feel Terror's Senseless Logic," a typical headline read, introducing a <CITE>New York Times</CITE> commentary by Douglas Jehl that sought to probe the deeper meaning of the atrocity. Jehl writes that the search for a rational explanation is misguided, a "particularly American" error. We are "a culture attuned to the straightforward"; but "terrorism represents a confrontation with the oblique." We must learn not "to assume that terrorist attacks will always reflect Western logic." They may "appear to the outside world as senseless," terrorologist Brian Jenkins explains, "but within the little community, they will be satisfied." Americans are "unfamiliar with such geometry," Jehl continues, "because of a fortunate insulation. Until the World Trade Center bombing, such attacks seemed to flare primarily on far-off horizons. Americans have largely been voyeurs to sustained terror campaigns," carried out by strange people out there who don't comprehend Western logic and the "civilized values" to which the West has always been dedicated.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>True, Jehl notes, "the most violent acts of international terrorism have generally reflected some clear logic." He gives one example: "the 1983 bombing attacks on the American Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut," which were "attempts to drive the United States from Lebanon." It is also possible that the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner "was revenge for the 1986 raid on Tripoli" in Libya, and therefore had a certain twisted rationale. But we have to learn that others are not like us, and regularly act in ways that have no "clear logic."

<P>A <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> editorial found "two unnerving portents in the arrest of a Muslim fundamentalist" suspect. "The first, and most general, is that Americans can no longer assume they are safe from the terrorist pathology that has afflicted other countries." The second is that the US may "become a target for the kind of political violence practiced elsewhere by fanatic Muslim fundamentalists," a fact driven home by the "unique cruelty" of the World Trade Center bombing.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></FONT></SUP> Many others drew similar conclusions about the foreign plague, unaccountably reaching our own shores.

<P>A different interpretation of the bombing was given in a letter from "the LIBERATION ARMY" received by the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> four days after it occurred, allegedly written by the group of Islamic fundamentalists who had carried it out. "The American people must know, that their civilians who got killed are not better than those who are getting killed by the American weapons and support," the letter reads: "The American people are responsible for the actions of their government and they must question all of the crimes that their government is committing against other people." If they do not, they "will be the targets of our operations..."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Still adopting the official version without question, we take the letter to be authentic and to express the views of the terrorists. Comparing these two diametrically opposed interpretations, a number of questions arise.

<P>One question is factual. According to the US version -- virtually universal -- terrorist atrocities are carried out by fanatics who despise democracy and freedom (or are inspired by Third World pathologies, without any "clear logic"). Therefore, the scholarly literature concludes, they occur "almost exclusively in democratic or relatively democratic societies," in an attempt to destabilize or undermine them (Walter Laqueur, in a much acclaimed study of the plague). The perpetrators are the kind of people who bombed the "Marine barracks in Beirut" in one of "the most violent acts of international terrorism," as the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> and its colleagues see it. The "unique cruelty" of the World Trade Center bombing shows that we too may be "afflicted" by the horrors that are conducted by "Palestinians, [Colombian] M-19s, and other Third World detritus" (Joe Klein, <CITE>Esquire,</CITE> 1986), and now "Islamic fundamentalists."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>According to the radically conflicting version presented in the Liberation Army letter, the US is a major perpetrator of international terrorism, its victims being mostly the despised "Third World detritus."

<P>Which version is correct?

<P>I posed this as a question of fact, and on the surface, that is what it seems to be. But the appearance is misleading. The factual question arises only after we decide what counts as terrorism. Here, we face problems. There are explicit definitions of terrorism, more or less the same in content (though with interesting differences, to which we return). But these are not the ones adopted in the literature on terrorism. Here some care is necessary.

<P>The explicit definitions we find in the US Code, international conventions, official or quasi-official US documents, and other such sources. These agree that terrorism is "the calculated use of violence or threat of violence to attain goals that are political, religious, or ideological in nature. This is done through intimidation, coercion, or instilling fear" (<CITE>US Army Operational Concept for Terrorism Counteraction</CITE>). Still simpler is the characterization in a Pentagon-commissioned study by noted terrorologist Robert Kupperman, which speaks of the threat or use of force "to achieve political objectives without the full-scale commitment of resources," that is, short of outright war.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>We might counterpose to these an Orwellian definition, too cynical to take seriously: "terrorism" is terrorism <I>that is perpetrated by official enemies</I>; terrorism that we or our clients conduct does not fall under the concept. Conceivably, a definition of that sort might have been employed in Stalinist Russia, where, as <CITE>Times</CITE> correspondent Steven Erlanger remarks in one of the many self-righteous commentaries on our virtue and their awfulness, "The Soviet manipulation of truth devalued political language so thoroughly, as George Orwell understood, that no career Russian politican thinks twice about saying whatever words are most convenient."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Note that if we were to adopt the Orwellian definition, we would have to inquire no further into the doctrine of scholarship, media, and the intellectual community generally: it would be true as a matter of logic that terrorism is conducted by <I>them</I> against <I>us.</I> But there is a more interesting fact: to maintain the standard doctrine, it is <I>necessary</I> to adopt the Orwellian definition, the one we would ridicule if the commissars in a totalitarian state were to sink to this level. If we define "terrorism" simply as terrorism, it is child's play to demonstrate that the authors of the much-reviled Liberation Army letter happen to be accurate in their factual assumptions. Merely to illustrate, note that I cheated in quoting Kupperman; he is defining not "terrorism," but "low intensity conflict," that is, the doctrine to which the US is officially committed, which as both the doctrinal framework and practice show, is simply international terrorism writ large. The US may be the only country that is officially and publicly committed to wholesale international terrorism as a standard policy instrument. Since that conclusion plainly won't do at all, the Orwellian definition must be adopted, as is done uniformly, and presumably without awareness for the most part, a most remarkable phenomenon in a society free from coercion, by comparative standards. Though accurate, the conclusion is so unacceptable that it simply cannot be perceived and never will be in respectable circles, no matter how conclusively it is demonstrated. The intellectual culture would have to undergo a profound revolution before such truisms could be considered.

<P>The doctrinal system is by no means satisfied with "manipulation of truth that devalues political language so thoroughly that no self-respecting commentator thinks twice about saying whatever words are most convenient," to paraphrase the derisive (and accurate) <CITE>Times</CITE> description of the official enemy. As already illustrated, standard practice goes even beyond the Orwellian definition of "terrorism." Consider the <CITE>Times</CITE> choice for "the most violent acts of international terrorism": "the 1983 bombing attacks on the American Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut." Recall that international terrorism is terrorism crossing national borders. We are to understand, then, that the victims of the terror (the Marines in Beirut) were in their own country and the Lebanese who bombed their barracks are outside invaders. The assumption passes without comment in a culture that takes it for granted that we own the world, a culture capable of denouncing "the assault from the inside" against us in South Vietnam -- JFK's description, 10 days before the assassination, of the aggression by South Vietnamese peasants against the US forces defending their villages with bombs, napalm, and massive expulsions of the aggressors to concentration camps.

<P>We may also ask a further question. Why does the bombing of the Marine barracks count as terrorism at all? The major international convention on terrorism, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, explicitly exempts from the category acts of resistance against foreign military forces and racist and colonialist regimes. True, it was not passed unanimously; only 153-2 (US and Israel opposed, Honduras alone abstaining). Therefore it remained unreported, out of history, and not germane to the discussion of terrorism, which, for the press and other commentators, is defined as Washington construes the concept, in its usual splendid isolation. Furthermore, the entire matter is barred from discussion, a fact with important policy consequences. When the Palestinian National Council, in 1988, endorsed the UN convention, the editors of the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> bitterly condemned the move, ridiculing "the old Arafat hedge," a position affirmed by its leading dissident, Anthony Lewis: "the United States says correctly that the PLO must unambiguously renounce all terrorism before it can take part in negotiations," and recognition of international conventions plainly does not reach those heights. It is not simply that commentators across the board take Washington's stand as correct, which would be startling enough, on any issue. Rather, far more stringent totalitarian standards must be satisfied: there is no conceivable alternative to Washington's stand; the position of the world need not be reported, refuted, nor enter the discussion in any way.

<P>Those who bombed the barracks in Beirut surely perceived the Marines as a foreign military force supporting their oppressors, not without reason. By world standards, the incident does not qualify as terrorism at all, let alone as the paradigm example of "international terrorism." But such questions are far too subtle to raise in an intellectual culture capable of reflexively adopting the Orwellian definition of "terrorism."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>This is not the place to review the ample record of international terrorism by the US and its clients. We might merely recall some highlights, to illustrate what the despised semi-literate detritus may have in mind. The day their letter appeared as the lead story in the <CITE>Times,</CITE> AP reported a communique' of the Lebanese army that "a civilian was killed and 10 others were wounded when an Israeli force backing South Lebanon Army militiamen blasted the village of Kfar Milki with tank and mortar fire" north of Israel's "security zone" -- that is, the sector of southern Lebanon that Israel occupies in violation of Security Council Resolution 425 (March 1978), controls with terror and torture, and uses as a base for attacking the rest of Lebanon at will with many civilians killed; it is the "security zone" for the US media because such is the decision of Washington and its client.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Such helpful coincidences are not uncommon. A few weeks earlier, <CITE>Times</CITE> correspondent Judith Miller had a front-page story on an Arab-American imprisoned in Israel who, under long interrogation by the secret police, "has provided unusually detailed information suggesting that Hamas...has drawn critical financial support and political and military guidance from agents in the United States." On the same day, an inside page reported that "The Israelis and the South Lebanon Army pounded Shiite villages north of the security zone with artillery today after a South Lebanon Army stronghold came under rocket attacks," the regular practice of the occupation army and its mercenaries. Even by the standards of respectable opinion it should be difficult to describe an attack on a murderous military force kept in power by a foreign army as "terrorism," which justifies the bombing of civilians in retaliation. The doctrinal system has risen to the challenge admirably, however.

<P>The hard question that Miller and others ponder is whether Americans should be barred from contributing to Hamas's social and cultural activities, in the light of the confessions extracted by the Israeli secret police in prison interrogations. No question arises to whether Americans should be forced to contribute to Israel's vast and well-documented terrorist practices, as they do directly through US government grants on a scale without precedent, and indirectly through tax-free gifts by others (also without precedent). With regard to Hamas, the question is a legitimate policy concern; with regard to Israel, it is a conclusive proof of anti-Semitism.

<P>Arab prisoners over the years have been most forthcoming under interrogation, perhaps because "It's part of their nature" to confess, as Israeli Supreme Court Justice Moshe Etzioni explained to Amnesty International when asked about the remarkably high level of confessions (under torture, as was later conceded, and of course always known to all but the willfully blind). It was never explained why Jewish prisoners were also confessing under interrogation to crimes they did not commit; this was forgotten several years later when the fact that prisoners were regularly tortured could no longer be concealed, a "revelation" that elicited much outrage among the High Court Justices -- because the secret police had been lying to them, a practice intolerable in a democratic society.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Within Israel's "security zone," some 300 expelled Palestinians are now languishing in miserable and worsening conditions, forgotten, because the Clinton administration announced that Israel's decision to leave them to rot there is "consistent" with the Security Council demand that they be returned to their homes immediately. The original 400 were expelled on grounds that they were "Hamas activists" responsible for "terrorist acts"; namely, attacks against the Israeli occupying army. "We should pay heed to the fact that like all Hamas guerrilla operations prior to the expulsion [of the 400], yesterday's operation was targeted at soldiers," a lead article in the Israeli press observed a month later: "We cannot accuse them of practicing random terror which hits innocent women and children, because they don't."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The very knowledgeable Israeli correspondent Danny Rubinstein writes that about half the alleged "Hamas activists" worked in Islamic religious institutions, including preachers, teachers, "a large number of young people who serve as missionaries for increasing religious practice," and professionals who "helped establish the Islamic movement's network of educational and welfare institutions which includes clinics, kindergartens, kitchens for the needy, and organizations providing aid to prisoners' families, invalids, and orphans." "Members of the military wing of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad organization are not among those deported," he adds.

<P>Israeli intelligence agrees. An important report last December published in Israel's leading journal, <CITE>Ha'aretz,</CITE> quoted a "senior government official" who said that the intelligence services (Shin Bet) provided Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin with <I>six names</I> of Hamas activists, adding one more when they were asked "to increase the number"; intelligence was "astonished" to learn that more than 400 had been expelled -- without any relevant intelligence information. The facts were reported here only by Alexander Cockburn, to my knowledge; the press kept to the version presented in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> by Israeli Arabist Ehud Yaari, an associate of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. According to Yaari, who does not cite the intelligence reports and other Israeli sources that he knows well, "About 300 of the 413 deportees constituted Hamas's command network in the West Bank and Gaza Strip." His account makes some sense on the assumptions expressed by Cabinet Legal Advisor Yossef Harish, arguing for the expulsion before Israel's High Court: asked how many residents of the occupied territories are members of terrorist organizations, he responded "I think all of them."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The expulsions serve to undermine social and cultural work in the occupied territories, much like the fevered propaganda campaign to cut off support from US citizens for such activities. There is nothing new about these plans. It is worthwhile to recall the longstanding policy guidelines of the Labor doves. These were stated lucidly in internal discussion in 1972 by Haim Herzog, later President:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"I do not deny the Palestinians any place or stand or opinion on every matter. But certainly I am not prepared to consider them as partners in any respect in a land that has been consecrated in the hands of our nation for thousands of years. For the Jews of this land there cannot be any partner."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></FONT></SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Herzog was merely expressing traditional doctrine. "We demand that our inheritance, Palestine, be returned to us and if there is no room for Arabs, they have the opportunity of going to Iraq," David Ben-Gurion declared in 1937, expressing a consensus that reached to the moral heroes of the Yishuv (Jewish settlement), who argued that wholesale "compulsory transfer" by the British was the solution to the problem.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>These doctrines were forcefully reaffirmed after Israel's 1967 conquests. Israeli rule over the territories is "permanent," Moshe Dayan held: "the settlements are forever, and the future borders will include these settlements as part of Israel." One of the Israeli leaders most attuned to the needs and concerns of the Palestinians, Dayan advised the cabinet that Israel should tell the Palestinian refugees in the territories "that we have no solution, that you shall continue to live like dogs, and whoever wants to can leave -- and we will see where this process leads... In five years we may have 200,000 less people -- and that is a matter of enormous importance." The regime of daily humiliation and brutality that ensued is the "benign occupation" lauded by the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> and other starry-eyed observers. From the founder, Chaim Weizmann, until Yitzhak Rabin today, the guiding assumption has been that with sufficient force and resolve, the "insignificant Negroes" who were scattered in the Land of Israel will be "crushed" and "broken"; they will "die" or "turn into human dust and the waste of society," Israeli Arabists predicted, "and join the most impoverished classes in the Arab countries." It therefore only makes sense to deny them the means for a decent existence.

<P>Such facts may also have been in the minds of the writers of the Liberation Army letter, who, like poor and oppressed people everywhere, do not need to pore through arcane secret documents to learn about the reality of the world, which they know from their daily experience.

<P>Ehud Yaari's current home, the Washington Institute of Near East Studies, plays an interesting role in American cultural life. Virtually a segment of the Israeli lobby, it enables reporters to present US-Israeli propaganda while preserving their fabled objectivity, keeping their opinions to themselves while citing some "expert" to provide the line they wish to propagate, the standard device. The Institute was established by Martin Indyk, an Australian employee of the registered Israeli lobby (AIPAC), who felt that most Washington think tanks were too pro-Arab and anti-Israel, some even recommending that the US join the international consensus on a peaceful diplomatic settlement. Indyk is now Clinton's main Middle East adviser, having obtained citizenship a few days before his appointment. Another leading expert at the Institute, the much-quoted Robert Satloff, explains that Palestinians should be heartened by the Clinton Administration's determination that Israel is honoring the Security Council resolution on the deportees by flagrantly violating it: "It's to the Palestinians' negotiating advantage that the US and the Israelis have the relationship they have now." That insight should come as a great relief to the men seeking to survive the harsh climate of Scorpion Hill in southern Lebanon, and their families.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>It would only be fair to add that as Israel expelled 400 "Hamas activists" from their homes, it demonstrated its unique sensitivity to the suffering of Muslims by admitting a group of Bosnians (83, according to a report by Marwan Bishara). In an effort to temper the world reaction to the deportation, the government of Israel adopted an earlier proposal to this effect by Israeli Arab mayors, placing its implementation in the hands of a leader of the parliamentary left, Yossi Sarid; most of those who had initiated the proposal backed out, Bishara reports, given the circumstances. The Bosnians were sent to the Arab village of Tarshiha, the site of a land clearing operation by air and artillery bombardment, then deportation, in 1948-49, leaving some 700 Christians of the original 4-5,000 population (4/5 Muslims), according to Israeli historian Benny Morris. The lands were confiscated and used for Jewish settlement; the former inhabitants and their descendants live in refugee camps in Lebanon. Bishara recommends that "the newly arrived Bosnians should visit the Village of Flowers, and in particular, a certain fascinating villa with `mysterious' beauty that school children sometimes visit. It was built using the stones of the deserted and destroyed houses of Tarshiha Moslems. It is a post-modern residence in a post-cynical country," known here as "the symbol of human decency," in <CITE>Times</CITE> lingo.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The official terrorist plague peaked in 1985, when Mid-East terrorism was selected as the lead story of the year in an AP poll of editors. The worst single terrorist act of that year in the Middle East was a car-bombing in Beirut that killed 80 people and wounded 256. The target was the Shi'ite leader Sheikh Fadlallah, who escaped unharmed. The attack was organized by the CIA and its Saudi clients with Lebanese and British assistance, and specifically authorized by CIA director William Casey, according to <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> reporter Bob Woodward's book on Casey. That was not the worst terrorist act of the year, however. The prize was taken by the blowing up of an Air India flight, killing 329 people -- the worst terrorist air attack ever. It was traced to a paramilitary camp in Alabama where terrorists were trained for actions in Central America and elsewhere. On a visit to India, Attorney-General Edwin Meese tacitly conceded that the operation originated in a US terrorist training camp.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></FONT></SUP> Little further is known; such incidents do not fall within the canon, according to the reigning Orwellian doctrine, and therefore merit little attention.

<P>By far the major targets of direct US international terrorism have been Cuba and Nicaragua, as determined by the World Court, in the latter case, in a decision that elicited much derision here. These terrorist operations were extraordinary in scale, vastly beyond those attributed to the officially designated terrorist states. Among them is the terrorist act that should rank as history's most ominous, an act that might have set off a nuclear war. At one of the tensest moments of the Cuban missile crisis, when Cubans may have had operational control of the missiles, one of Kennedy's terrorist teams blew up a Cuban industrial facility killing 400 workers, guided by "photographs taken by spying planes," Fidel Castro alleged. When reported years later by the highly regarded authority Raymond Garthoff, the revelation drew no detectable notice, and the incident -- of course -- does not fall within the canon.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Throughout all these years, Americans remained "voyeurs," observing the mindless evil of others with wonder and dismay.

<P>An honest observer familiar with even a fraction of the shameful record could hardly fail to be amazed by the discipline of the intellectual community, which keeps to the official line without detectable deviation: "Terror's senseless logic" is foreign to American thought patterns, the "unique cruelty" of the World Trade Center bombing reveals that we can no longer be merely observers from afar of the horrors perpetrated by uncivilized wretches who cannot aspire to enter our moral universe, and all the rest. The <CITE>New York Times</CITE> editors recommend measures to "Keep Foreign Terrorism Foreign"; understandable, if we think of it as an extreme version of what a minor player like Qaddafi might mean had he said the same thing, calling for measures to keep terrorism away from his shores after the terrorist attack on Tripoli that murdered dozens of civilians -- but does not enter the canon.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>While some are laboring to establish an "Iranian connection" in the World Trade Center bombing, a CIA connection is much more prominent. As publicly recognized, those charged and suspected are directly involved with the CIA-run operations in Afghanistan, financed by the US and Saudi Arabia, where they learned their trade. In particular, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, widely reported to be the guru of the group, is considered by specialists to have been close to Hekmatyar, the CIA's favorite terrorist and Islamic fundamentalist fanatic. Other veterans of CIA training have "radically transformed" anti-government activities in Egypt, a senior Egyptian official said, sharply raising the level of violence and terror there, while still others appear to be doing the same in Yemen. Egypt's President Mubarak claims that the CIA clients have been "persuaded by the Iranians" to destabilize Arab regimes, so guilt is properly assigned; but it is not an easy task.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>A final comment on the World Trade Center bombing. The accused left a remarkably transparent trail and chose a curious way to bomb a building. Two possibilities come to mind. The first is that this was an amateur job of the most extraordinary ineptness. The second is that it was a highly professional operation by efficient and practiced hands, using a group of people that was easily penetrated and manipulated for these purposes. At the time of writing (March 1993), both possibilities seem open.

<H3>3. "Hatred by the People"</H3>

<P>The Liberation Army letter condemns US government crimes, and calls on the American people to question them. Reporting and commentary that is designed to enlighten would make it clear that there is nothing new about such sentiments, and would explore the reasons for them.

<P>In July 1958, President Eisenhower commented on US problems in the Arab world in a staff discussion: "The trouble is that we have a campaign of hatred against us, not by the governments but by the people," who are "on Nasser's side." As for Nasser, he was "an extremely dangerous fanatic," John Foster Dulles concluded in August 1956, because of his stubborn insistence on a neutralist course -- though even Nasser wasn't as bad as Khrushchev, "more like Hitler than any Russian leader we have previously seen," Dulles informed the National Security Council a year later.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Typically, governments are not a problem; they can be controlled, or else overthrown. The people are a more difficult nut to crack. The problem is pervasive, domestically as well. In the Middle East, it arose once again during the 1990-91 Gulf conflict. It was common then to say that the world was united against Saddam Hussein; not untrue, if "the world" consists of its white faces. But in a sector of the world extending from Morocco to Indonesia, and not only there, it would have been more accurate to say that the world was united against the US-UK war, taking "the world" to include its people. It was only the harshest and most brutal US allies, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, that could efficiently suppress popular opposition; where there was even a minimal "democratic opening" or departure from tyranny, that generally proved impossible. The hostility to functioning democracy that has long been a guiding principle of US policy, peaking in the 1980s, is readily understandable.

<P>That principle has guided US policy towards Iraq throughout. Until his first transgression, in August 1990, Saddam Hussein was a trusted friend, whose "iron fist...held Iraq together, much to the satisfaction of the American allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia," as <CITE>Times</CITE> chief diplomatic correspondent Thomas Friedman reported Administration thinking in the months after the war. But Saddam's disobedience could not stand unpunished, so the US sought to find a general who might topple Saddam, "and then Washington would have the best of all worlds: an iron-fisted Iraqi junta without Saddam Hussein" -- in effect, a return to the status quo. For similar reasons, the US always dismissed the Iraqi democratic opposition with disdain, including its most conservative elements, such as London-based banker Ahmed Chalabi, who observed in March 1992 that Washington was "waiting for Saddam to butcher the insurgents in the hope that he can be overthrown later by a suitable officer," an attitude rooted in the US policy of "supporting dictatorships to maintain stability." As Friedman later reported, he had perceived State Department reasoning quite accurately.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>We might ask why there should have been "a campaign of hatred against us by the people" already in July 1958, when the US had just unceremoniously expelled Israel from the Sinai and its allies from the Canal Zone after the Israeli-French-British invasion of Egypt, and well before the "special relationship" with Israel was in place. It's easy to explain the hatred in Iran, where a CIA coup overthrew the conservative parliamentary regime and restored the Shah in 1953. A decade of CIA operations in Syria may help explain the matter further. Syria had traditionally been pro-American, but clandestine US intervention "helped reverse a century of friendship," Douglas Little observes in a review of these operations. In 1948, the CIA approached Chief of Staff Husni Zaim to discuss the "possibility [of an] army supported dictatorship," a result achieved when Zaim overthrew the goverment a few months later. Zaim called for peace talks with Israel, offering to resettle 250,000 Palestinian refugees, and approved an ARAMCO oil pipeline concession. Israel chose not to pursue the diplomatic opportunity. Zaim was overthrown a few months later. In 1951, Col Adib Shishakli overthrew the government and set up a military dictatorship, with clandestine US support. Matters drifted out of control again, and in March 1956, Eisenhower approved Project Omega, which aimed to overthrow the increasingly pro-Nasser regime in Syria as part of a more general plan to undermine Nasser by supporting the Gulf dictatorships and scuttling the Aswan Dam project. Operation Straggle, organized jointly with British intelligence to overthrow the government of Syria, was timed (apparently, under British initiative) exactly on the day of the invasion of Egypt, which France and Britain had kept secret from the US. Possibly the British goal was to keep the US preoccupied elsewhere. In any event, Syrian counterintelligence had uncovered the plot, and it quickly unravelled. The "Eisenhower Doctrine," approved by Congress in 1957, authorized the President to dispatch US troops to counter "Soviet subversion," the usual code word for independent initiatives (which, naturally, tended to lead to reliance on the USSR, given US hostility and subversion). While Egypt was the publicly-designated culprit, US officials believed that Syria was more "nearly under the control of international communism," Little concludes. Several clandestine operations sought to subvert the government of Syria, leading finally to a bungled CIA effort again penetrated by Syrian intelligence. The end result was great hostility to the US, close Syrian relations with the USSR, and much hysteria in Washington about "losing the whole Middle East to Communism."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT25" HREF="#FN25">25</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Eisenhower's rueful comment on the "hatred of the people" was made on July 15, 1958, as he sent 10,000 Marines to Lebanon to shore up a right-wing government, in response to the nationalist coup in Iraq that was taken to be Nasserite in inspiration, the first break in the Anglo-American rule over the oil-rich states. That caused renewed hysteria in both Washington and London, leading to secret decisions to grant nominal independence to Kuwait to prevent the nationalist rot from spreading, while Britain reserved the right "ruthlessly to intervene, whoever it is has caused the trouble...if things go wrong." The US adopted the same stand with regard to the richer prizes in the Arabian peninsula. The primary motive was to ensure that profits from Kuwaiti oil would maintain the health of Britain's ailing economy, a problem that was to arise for the senior partner too not long after.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT26" HREF="#FN26">26</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Some months earlier, in January 1958, the National Security Council had concluded that a "logical corollary" of opposition to radical Arab nationalism "would be to support Israel as the only strong pro-Western power left in the Middle East." Ten years before, Israel's military successes had much impressed the Joint Chiefs of Staff, leading them to consider Israel to be the major regional military power after Turkey, offering the U.S. means to "gain strategic advantage in the Middle East that would offset the effects of the decline of British power in that area." Close intelligence links were established at that time. By the mid-1960s, Israel's role as a barrier to Nasserite influence in the Gulf became more salient, and the alliance was firmed up as Israel destroyed Egypt's military forces in 1967, also conquering the West Bank, the Sinai and Gaza Strip, and the Syrian Golan Heights, and expelling several hundred thousand Palestinians (200,000 more were expelled in subsequent months, in what was cynically called a "voluntary" migration; Dayan's projected 200,000 would be in addition to these).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT27" HREF="#FN27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>By then the "hatred of the people" had more tangible reasons than in 1958. It became more firmly established as Israel pursued its policies of integrating the territories with lavish US support, and attacking Lebanon from the early 1970s, with a huge civilian toll.

<P>When we add to the balance the US support for the dictatorships that ensure the flow of oil riches to the West, instead of to the people of the region, and other US actions (for example, the bombing of Libya, the support for Israel's terror bombing of Tunis, and much else), we begin to perceive that "terror's logic" may not be entirely "senseless," however inexcusable the means employed, and that it is a pea on a mountain when compared with the regular US practice of international terrorism. The fear that Americans may no longer be mere "voyeurs to sustained terror campaigns" are not groundless. The population, as usual, is ill-served by the intellectual culture, with its remarkably totalitarian strains, which provides a version of history so radically at odds with reality that its victims can scarcely understand what is happening to them.

<P>The historically unique US-Israel alliance has been based on the perception that Israel is a "strategic asset," fulfilling US goals in the region in tacit alliance with the Arab facade in the Gulf and other regional protectors of the family dictatorships, and performing services elsewhere. Those who see Israel's future as an efficient Sparta, at permanent war with its enemies and surviving at the whim of the US, naturally want that relationship to continue -- including, it seems, most of the organized American Jewish community, a fact that has long outraged Israeli doves. The doctrine is explained currently by General (res.) Shlomo Gazit, former head of Israeli military intelligence and a senior official of the military administration of the occupied territories. After the collapse of the USSR, he writes,

<P>"Israel's main task has not changed at all, and it remains of crucial importance. Its location at the center of the Arab Muslim Middle East predestines Irael to be a devoted guardian of stability in all the countries surrounding it. Its [role] is to protect the existing regimes: to prevent or halt the processes of radicalization and to block the explanion of fundamentalist religious zealotry."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT28" HREF="#FN28">28</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>To which we may add: performing dirty work that the US is unable to undertake itself, because of popular opposition or other costs. The conception has its grim logic. What is remarkable is that advocacy of it should be identified as "support for Israel."

<H3>4. A Way Out?</H3>

<P>Is there a way out of this morass? As the years pass, the prospects dim, but it remains possible to imagine a diplomatic settlement which, while satisfying no one's sense of justice and guaranteeing nothing, nevertheless provides at least some hope for peace and moves towards the closer integration across national boundaries that is a necessity if the region is to have a healthy future.

<P>One problem -- not the only one but a central one nonetheless -- is the conflict over the occupied territories. As well-known to those familiar with primary sources and the dissident literature, including readers of this journal, the US has undermined the international consensus on a diplomatic settlement since 1971, when Henry Kissinger took control of US policy and introduced his policy of "stalemate." The US has scarcely deviated since from this rejectionist stand, in virtual international isolation, vetoing Security Council resolutions, voting alone (with Israel) against General Assembly resolutions, barring peace initiatives from Europe, the Arab states, and the PLO. Most of this record has been suppressed in the media and journals of opinion, often grossly falsified, a fact extensively documented elsewhere. Again, the population has been ill-served by the "manipulation of truth" by the doctrinal managers, who have, once again, "devalued political language so thoroughly, as George Orwell understood, that no [American intellectual or political figure] thinks twice about saying whatever words are most convenient"; the Erlanger paraphrase is a bit of an exaggeration, as was his original, but not by much. The comparison to the perversion of the record on terrorism is striking.

<P>Until Kissinger's policy coup, the US was well within the international consensus. The State Department's Rogers plan of December 1969 called for a settlement in terms of UN 242 as understood throughout most of the world, with nothing for the Palestinians, and a full peace agreement on the (pre-June 1967) international borders, perhaps with minor and mutual adjustments. Israel rejected the territorial arrangements, Egypt and other Arab states the conditions on a full peace agreement. In February 1971, Egypt accepted a UN initiative virtually identical to the Rogers Plan. Israel recognized it as a genuine peace offer, but rejected it, anticipating further territorial gains. The USSR accepted the same plan in November 1971.

<P>By then, however, Kissinger had taken over, with his lunatic insistence on "stalemate until Moscow urged compromise or until, even better, some moderate Arab regime decided that the route to progress was through Washington." The facts were an utter irrelevance, even eight years later, when Kissinger delivered himself of this astonishing pronouncement, adding with equal perspecuity that "Until some Arab state showed a willingess to separate from the Soviets, or the Soviets were prepared to dissociate from the maximum Arab program, we had no reason to modify our policy" of stalemate. Of the two major Arab states, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, it is true that the former had not separated from the Soviets, nor could it, since it did not even have diplomatic relations with the hated Russians -- who had never associated themselves with the "maximum Arab program." And Egypt had not really separated from the Soviets either, both having adopted the official US policies that Kissinger rejected. But analyzing Kissinger's pronouncements by the standards of "Western logic" is a pointless exercise; his real goal, as he makes clear, was to undermine his despised enemy Secretary of State Rogers.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT29" HREF="#FN29">29</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Since then, the US has always insisted on two basic conditions: first, there can be no international involvement, the Middle East being US turf; second, the Palestinians, being useless for US strategic purposes, have no right of self-determination. The latter condition was in flat contradiction to the international consensus by the mid-1970s, reflected in the 1976 Security Council resolution vetoed by the US which called for a two-state settlement. The Camp David agreement under Carter was tolerable because it satisfied the US conditions, also preparing the ground for Israel's accelerated integration of the territories and attacks against Lebanon, as was obvious at once, and is now conceded in retrospect. The record of US rejectionism is what is technically called "the peace process." That process now continues, satisfying the US demands: the current negotiations are run unilaterally by the US, with only a token presence by other powers, and the Palestinians are offered nothing, as stipulated by the 1989 Baker-Shamir-Peres plan, which has yet to be discussed in the US mainstream.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT30" HREF="#FN30">30</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The essence of "Western logic" was expressed with admirable clarity by Nestor Sanchez, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan years, after the UN Truth Commission report exposed huge atrocities by US clients in El Salvador -- exposed, that is, some of the atrocities that had long been known to anyone who cared, including the media, which now profess to be shocked. Sanchez considers the whole exercise ridiculous:

<P>"We won. Why do we have to beat a dead horse? You go into a prize fight and the winner knocks out the contender, and then you question the blow? That's stupid."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT31" HREF="#FN31">31</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Any Nazi would nod his head in approval. The logic is impeccable, and a leading principle of statecraft.

<P>On other matters, the American people have questioned crimes that their government commits against the people of the traditional colonial domains, with salutary consequences. On the matters reviewed here, that has yet to happen. The beginning of wisdom is willingness to face the facts. From there, the road is not an easy one, but refusal to follow it only guarantees further torment.

<H1>"Mandate for Change,"<BR>
or Business as Usual</H1>
<P>Noam Chomsky<BR>
<CITE>Z Magazine,</CITE> February 1993
</CENTER>


<P>As the victors were recovering from the celebration of their electoral triumph in November, the front-page headlines read: "The Economy: Aides plan a scaled-back early agenda." "A group of aides to President-elect Bill Clinton is preparing an economic plan for the Democrat's early days in office that would postpone action on some of his more sweeping proposals in favor of a moderate increase in infrastructure spending, preliminary steps to control rising health care costs and a series of business tax breaks that rated little mention during the campaign," political correspondent Peter Gosselin reported. In the following days, Clinton's advisers, including those on the progressive fringe, reiterated the message, which had been understood all along by corporate-financial sectors; the steadiness of the markets and strength of the dollar were among the many indications of the general satisfaction with Clinton's imminent victory in the business world, which was soon to be reassured further by his top appointments and indication of priorities.

<P>The magic word in Clinton's campaign had been "Change," a reorientation of policy toward the needs of the great majority of the population who had suffered from Reagan-Bush "trickle down" economics -- in practice, an upward flood -- and had swept Clinton into office on the promise of an end to the party for the rich. But it would be unfair to speak unkindly of the newly-elected President for clarifying at once that the fine words of the campaign were not intended seriously, that the "Mandate for Change" proclaimed by a Clinton think tank meant "Business as Usual," as it did when Eisenhower's PR team coined the phrase. "Campaign pledges [are] made to be broken," Harvard political scientist and media specialist Marty Linsky explained when President Bush called for "revenue enhancement" after winning the 1988 election with a pledge not to raise taxes. To accuse Bush of violating his campaign pledge was a "political cheap shot." When he led the public in his "read my lips -- no new taxes" chant, Bush had merely been expressing his "world view," making "a statement of his hopes." The same precepts hold for his successor.

<P>Only the most naive, who do not comprehend the democratic system, could think that their political representatives mean what they say. Sophisticates understand that "elections and governing are different ball games, played with different objectives and rules." "The purpose of elections is to win," Linsky elaborated, expressing the contempt for democracy that is standard fare among educated elites; and "the purpose of governing is to do the best for the country" -- where "the country" is to be understood as "those who matter," though honesty on that score as well would be too much to expect.

<P>This course of instruction is helpful. The lessons have broad application. Take the concept "jobs." It is beyond doubt that more and better jobs are desperately needed. "Job destruction [is] worse than we thought," economists Lawrence Mishel and Jared Bemstein report, with "more than 17 million workers, representing 13.2 percent of the labor force, ...unemployed or underemployed in July [1992]," a rise of 8 million during the Bush years. Furthermore, some three-fourths of the rise in unemployment is permanent loss of jobs. Meanwhile the stagnation of real wages changed to sharp decline from the mid-1980s, extending even to college-educated, while "of the gain in income per head, 70 percent accrued to the top 1 percent of income earners, while the bottom lost absolutely," MIT economist Rudiger Dombusch observes, so that "For most Americans, it is no longer true that the young generation can count on being economically ahead of its parents," a significant turning point in the history of industrial society.

<P>One can therefore appreciate the passionate concern expressed by political figures, corporate leaders, and their press agents over the need to create jobs for suffering Americans. Heartening indeed, until we recall our lessons. Looking a bit more closely, we find that the word "jobs" has taken on an entirely new meaning: "profits." Thus when George Bush takes off to Japan with a bevy of auto executives in tow, he waves the banner "jobs, jobs, jobs," meaning "profits, profits, profits," as a look at his social and economic policies demonstrates without equivocation. The press and air waves resound with promises to increase "jobs," put forth by those who do what is in their power to send them to high-repression, low-wage regions, and to destroy what remains of meaningful work and workers' rights, all in the interest of some unmentionable seven-letter word. All becomes clear once we join the sophisticates who understand that "the purpose of rhetoric is to delude," while "the purpose of governing is to do the best for `the country'" in the technical sense of that term.

<P>That "the country" in whose interests policy is designed is to be understood in class terms is, of course, no recent insight. Those who have been properly instructed in the famous "canon" will surely have "learned" that Adam Smith denounced the mercantilist and colonial systems as harmful and absurd, while preaching the virtues of free trade. As explained in the introduction to the Chicago bicentennial edition of Wealth of Nations by noted Chicago economist George Sligler, "Americans will find [Smith's] views on the American colonies especially instructive. He believed that there was, indeed, exploitation -- but of the English by the colonists," contrary to what the uninitiated might think. But few are likely to have discovered what Smith actually wrote. Mercantilism and colonialism may have harmed the general population of England, Smith concluded, but were of great benefit to the "merchants and manufacturers" who "have been by far the principal architects" of policy; their interests have "been most peculiarly attended to" by the system, though not the interests of consumers and working people. (As for the English colonists in America, the harsh regulations imposed upon them by imperial England were "a manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind," Smith wrote, though nothing like the "savage injustice" of the treatment of the lesser breeds).

<P>In brief, mercantilism and empire were among the many devices that regularly shape social and economic policy into a welfare project for the rich and powerful -- definitely not the right lesson for impressionable young minds. In this and many other ways, the contents of Smith's classic have been crucially modified as they enter contemporary ideology in the hands of his latter-day disciples, to form part of the "free market" theology preached by a variety of cynics.

<P>Smith's class analysis of policy-formation retains its relevance, and Linsky's lessons add a useful supplement. If "change" once again translates into new methods of enhancing existing power and privilege, we need only recognize that that is what is best for "the country," properly construed. Returning to the "sweeping proposals" that were instantly recognized to be "unnecessary" and "inappropriate," we may recall that the public was not merely indicating a preference for curtailing "rising health care costs" and for unspecified "infrastructure spending." Over two-thirds of the public have regularly called for the kind of national health insurance that exists in one or another form in all other industrial societies, in place of the highly bureaucratized "private enterprise" U.S. system, with its harsh rationing of health care by price and huge administrative expenses and other inefficiencies (the British National Health Service devoted 4 percent of total health-care expenditure to administrative costs in the late 1980s as compared with 21 percent in the U.S., the distinguished British conservative Ian Gilmour points out; the comparison with Canada is similar). And an overwhelming majority (83 percent in the latest Harris poll) protested that "the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer," that "the economic system is inherently unfair," as the president of the polling organization summarized popular feelings. Small wonder that Reagan's popularity is barely above Nixon's, far below other living ex-Presidents, and that he is particularly disliked by working people and "Reagan Democrats."

<P>But on a wide array of matters such as these, Clinton cannot be criticized, even unfairly, for quick abandonment of "campaign pledges" that are "made to be broken," since the pledges were never made. Both political factions, along with their sponsors and the ideological managers, understand that the childish confusions of the rabble need not be considered by the "men of virtue" who have assumed the responsibility of governing since the origins of the Republic, always seeking what is best for "the country."

<P>Popular confusions extend quite far. Through the 1980s, considerable majorities favored a nuclear freeze, social spending over military spending, more government regulation to protect worker health and safety, higher taxes if necessary for such purposes, and so on. The errors of the rabble are also prevalent among the other beneficiaries of the Reagan-Thatcher revolution. The British Social Attitudes survey for 1992 finds that "respondents came out in favour of public spending by bigger margins than ever," the London Guardian reports, with 65 percent favoring higher taxes and more spending.

<P>Perhaps they are reacting to Thatcher's achievements in creating the worst crisis for manufacturing industry in the 19th-20th century, destroying almost one-third of the manufacturing plant within a few years by blind pursuit of Friedmanite and laissez-faire doctrines that were falsified and failed at every turn, yielding a "miserable performance" for the economy through 1990, lowering growth rate, rapidly increasing poverty while playing "Good Samaritan only to the better off" and giving London almost the appearance of "a third-world capital" -- despite the huge shot-in-the-arm provided by North Sea oil and the sharp decline in prices of Third World exports (Ian Gilmour, in his incisive review of a decade of "Dancing with Dogma"). The result was to send Britain to "Europe's poorhouse," the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> observes in October 1992, "technically poor enough to apply for extra European Community cash" along with Spain, Ireland, Portugal, and Greece. Much the same happened in Australia, where a Labor government tried the same "cruel experiment" with the same consequences, a "dismal tale of economic failure," conservative Robert Manne points out in the business press, reviewing the well-documented "disaster."

<P>The destructive impact of neoliberal dogma on Third World societies has been extensively discussed. Less familiar is the fact that the three English-speaking societies, which danced with the same dogmas (though only to a limited extent, being powerful enough to violate the rules) suffered accordingly, a fact that should "have, at the very least, planted the seeds of doubt," Manne comments, with reference to Australia. In all three societies the doubts were allayed by what MIT economist Paul Krugman describes as a "combination of mendacity and sheer incompetence," referring specifically to attempts to suppress the truth "by the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE>, the U.S. Treasury Department, and a number of supposed economic experts," a record that demonstrates "the extent of the moral and intellectual decline of American conservatism," a record matched in England and Australia.

<P>As in the United States, the rabble in Britain have dangerous thoughts about the private economy. Asked how profits should be distributed, 42 percent chose investment, 39 percent workforce benefits, 14 percent consumer benefits (lower prices), and 3 percent share-holders/managers benefits. Asked how profits would be distributed, 28 percent predicted investment, 8 percent workforce benefits, 4 percent consumer benefits, and 54 percent shareholders/managers benefits. The conviction that the economic system is "inherently unfair" is widely shared, but well beyond the reach of the political system in societies that have succeeded in reducing the general public to a spectator role, as leading democratic theorists have long urged.


<H3>Problems of Governance</H3>

<P>While the two factions of the business party agree over a broad range, they differ in popular constituency and sometimes in tactical preferences. These are only tendencies, reflecting shifting alliances, but they are real and sometimes have policy consequences. The popular base of the Democrats lends more towards working people, the poor, women, minorities -- the rabble generally. The Republicans, who have been more open and forthright in presenting themselves as the party of owners and managers, have sought to create a popular base through appeal to jingoism, fear, religious fanaticism, and the like. That provides substantial outreach. Religious fundamentalists alone are a huge popular grouping in the United States, which resembles pre-industrial societies in that regard. This is a culture in which three-fourths of the population believe in religious miracles, half believe in the devil, 83 percent believe that the Bible is the "actual" or the inspired word of God, 39 percent believe in the Biblical prediction of Armageddon and "accept it with a certain fatalism," a mere 9 percent accept Darwinian evolution while 44 percent believe that "God created man pretty much in his present form at one time within the last 10,000 years," and so on. The "God and Country rally" that opened the national Republican convention is one remarkable illustration, which aroused no little amazement in conservative circles in Europe.

<P>Needless to say, neither political faction offers its popular constituency any real influence over matters of importance to "the country," but their concerns can be addressed at the margins. The dramatic assault on civil liberties during the Reagan years is a case in point. With a different popular base, Clinton will doubtless mitigate these policies, a matter of no small significance for personal life, though with only marginal impact on the primary task: to ensure the proper functioning of the welfare state for the rich.

<P>Here objective problems arise that cannot be ignored, and there are differing perspectives within the business community (hence the political system) as to how they should be addressed. One major concern is "industrial policy"; that is, the state role in sustaining private enterprise; the role of the state in securing "jobs," to resort to Politically Correct Newspeak. This was perhaps the major real issue in the 1992 election.

<P>It is hardly a secret that every successful industrial society, from England to the East Asian NICs, achieved that condition and maintains it by radically violating market principles. These principles do serve useful functions: they can be selectively invoked to restrict social spending, to undercut competitors, and to open Third World societies to more efficient exploitation (including now much of Eastern Europe). Within the ideological system, therefore, neoliberal doctrine is highly praised. But business has always insisted that a powerful state intervene to regulate disorderly markets, organize a public subsidy for advanced industry, suppress labor and independent forces at home and abroad, and in other ways protect the interests of those who control investment and finance, and thus set the general conditions within which the "architects of policy" meet their responsibilities. Any illusions that capitalism might be a viable system vanished -- apart from the secular theologians -- with the Great Depression and the successful recovery from it under the wartime command economy, administered by corporate executives who learned their lessons well.

<P>Like all advanced societies, the U.S. has relied on state intervention in the economy from its origins, though for ideological reasons, the fact is commonly denied. During the post-World War II period, such "industrial policy" was masked by the Pentagon system, including the Department of Energy (which produces nuclear weapons) and NASA, converted by the Kennedy administration to a significant component of the state-directed public subsidy to advanced industry.

<P>By the late 1940s, it was taken for granted in government-corporate circles that the state would have to intervene massively to maintain the private economy. In 1948, with postwar pent-up consumer demand exhausted and the economy sinking back into recession, Truman's "cold-war spending" was regarded by the business press as a "magic formula for almost endless good times" (<CITE>Steel</CITE>), a way to "maintain a generally upward tone" (<CITE>Business Week</CITE>). The <CITE>Magazine of Wall Street</CITE> saw military spending as a way to "inject new strength into the entire economy," and a few years later, found it "obvious that foreign economies as well as our own are now mainly dependent on the scope of continued arms spending in this country," referring to the international military Keynesianism that finally succeeded in reconstructing state capitalist industrial societies abroad and laying the basis for the huge expansion of Transnational Corporations (TNCs), at that time mainly U.S.-based.

<P>The Pentagon system was considered ideal for these purposes. It imposes on the public a large burden of the costs (research and development, R&D) and provides a guaranteed market for excess production, a useful cushion for management decisions. Furthermore, this form of industrial policy does not have the undesirable side-effects of social spending directed to human needs. Apart from unwelcome redistributive effects, the latter policies tend to interfere with managerial prerogatives; useful production may undercut private gain, while state-subsidized waste production (arms, Man-on-the-Moon extravaganzas, etc.) is a gift to the owner and manager, who will, furthermore, be granted control of any marketable spin-offs. Furthermore, social spending may well arouse public interest and participation, thus enhancing the threat of democracy; the public cares about hospitals, roads, neighborhoods, and so on, but has no opinion about the choice of missiles and high-tech fighter planes. The defects of social spending do not taint the military Keynesian alternative, which had the added advantage that it was well-adapted to the needs of advanced industry: computers and electronics generally, aviation, and a wide range of related technologies and enterprises.

<P>The Pentagon system of course served other purposes. As global enforcer, the U.S. needs intervention forces and an intimidating posture to facilitate their use. But its economic role has always been central, a fact well-known to military planners. Army Plans Chief General James Gavin, in charge of Army R&D under Eisenhower, noted that "What appears to be intense interservice rivalry in most cases...is fundamentally industrial rivalry." It was also recognized from the outset that these goals require "sacrifice and discipline" on the part of the general public (NSC 68). It was therefore necessary, Dean Acheson urged "to bludgeon the mass mind" of Congress and recalcitrant officials with the Communist threat in a manner "clearer than truth," and to "scare hell out of the American people," as Senator Vandenberg interpreted the message. To carry out these tasks has been a prime responsibility of intellectuals throughout these years.

<P>Public acquiescence was largely secured by fear. By the 1980s, however, the cry that "the Russians are coming" was losing its efficacy. The problem of the vanishing pretext was a troublesome one throughout the decade, heightened by the erosion of public tolerance in the face of growing economic problems. Major propaganda efforts were undertaken to conjure up new demons: international terrorism, Qaddafi and crazed Arabs generally, Sandinistas marching on Texas, Hispanic narcotraffickers, etc. The absurdity of the pretexts did not prevent them from having a certain effect though with only temporary success, a problem that must be faced.


<H3>Aiding the Pentagon</H3>

<P>In passing, we may note that the current PR campaign in Somalia has similar motives, a fact that is scarcely even disguised. The First Landing was carefully staged for TV. Pentagon briefings directed journalists to where they were wanted, even advising them when and where "to set up their cameras" (<CITE>New York Times</CITE>). Pentagon officials encouraged "extensive media coverage in a bid to cast the US mission in the most positive light," the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> reported, noting "the invasion's made-for-Hollywood quality," which aroused considerable ridicule in Europe, and occasionally here. These officials were "eager to advertise both to Somalia and the rest of the world the precedent-setting humanitarian mission," the <CITE>Post</CITE> reported, omitting the quotes around the last two words that authentic journalism would require.

<P>The operation will be "a good experience for other countries and for us to see what effect American generosity has on these types of disaster," the overseas relief chief of USAID Andrew Natsios, stated: "millions of lives will be saved Americans should feel very good about themselves" -- and about the Pentagon budget that allows such miracles of generosity. Officials "didn't hide the fact that they wanted to make it as easy as possible for the news media to cover an event that portrays them in a good light," Peter Grier reported in the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor.</CITE> "With the military budget crumbling, a little favorable publicity can only help." For the Marine Corps, the operation is a "showcase...at a time when Congress is under intense pressure to produce post-Cold War defense savings," the <CITE>Post</CITE> commented, and the whole affair is nothing less than "a public relations bonanza at just the right time." JCS chair Colin Powell added that the effort is a "paid political advertisement" on behalf of plans for an intervention force. The military "convoys were more a symbolic show for the world's television cameras than any serious effort to get a steady stream of food moving" <CITE>New York Times</CITE> correspondent Jane Perlez reported two weeks after the landing, under the heading "Somalia, We Are Here! (Now What Do We Do?)."

<P>The intervention "seemed to be largely devoid of ulterior political motives," Perlez added, a phrase that is obligatory even in reports that bring out clearly the overriding "political motives" and the great efforts to achieve the desired effect. These efforts were so obvious that only the most disciplined were able to suppress entirely what they knew and to marvel that the intervention "was justified <I>solely</I> on moral grounds" and thus put "the question of idealism in foreign policy rather purely" (<CITE>New Republic</CITE> editors, their emphasis).

<P>The pretensions could hardly be taken seriously. If Washington had any humanitarian concerns for the people of Somalia, it had ample opportunity to act upon them from 1978 through 1990, when it was the major supporter of Siad Barre, the Saddam Hussein clone who was then destroying Somali society, killing 50-60,000 according the African Watch and setting the stage for the horrors that followed-facts regularly finessed in current media coverage. There is no evidence of a sudden religious conversion since. Furthermore, there are numerous "humanitarian missions" that could readily be undertaken if generosity were even a marginal element in policy-making. To take a case close to home, it is agreed on all sides that a few phone calls to the ruling Generals -- not 30,000 troops -- would probably suffice to call off the savage terror in Haiti and allow the return of the democratically-elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, highly popular in Haiti if not in Washington; this minimal intervention would also save any number of infants from starvation and disease. Examples abound. That aside, no one who even pretends to be serious will lend credence to a "humanitarian act" carefully staged for the world's TV cameras -- particularly, when it is undertaken by a great power with a horrifying record of abuse of human rights, and a particular penchant for imposing starvation and disease on civilian societies by economic warfare (Vietnam, Cuba, Chile, Nicaragua, Iraq, ...).

<P>States are not moral agents. "Generosity" and "humanitarian missions" are tools of the trade of the commissar class in every society. Perhaps some historical examples can be found of "humanitarian intervention," but transparently, this is not one of them.

<P>As is fully recognized, the troops were sent well after the civil society had begun to recover and the crisis was clearly receding. "One thing is certain," Jane Perlez emphasizes: "the worst of the Somali famine of 1992 is past." "The Worst Was Over" (a sub-heading reads) well before the U.S. forces arrived in December. By early November, aid agencies in the distribution center in Baidoa, where the crisis was unusually severe, reported that about 80 percent of aid was reaching the most needy, and by the end of the month, the ICRC and other experienced agencies were reporting still higher figures. Recovery from Siad Barre's atrocities in the North had been substantial well before, and even in the region of greatest suffering in the South there was visible progress, thanks in part to the efforts of the highly-regarded UN mediator Muhammad Sahnoun, who was removed after his public criticism of the incompetence of the UN operations. Serious reservations about the character of the U.S. intervention were expressed by development and relief agencies and the few people really knowledgeable about Somalia and the problems of famine, among them Rakiya Omaar, the Somali head of Africa Watch who was dismissed when she publicly opposed the intervention, and her co-worker Alex de Waal, one of the leading specialists on African famines and East Africa, who resigned in protest. The American Friends Service Committee, which has carried out development programs and relief work in Somalia for over ten years and is implementing emergency programs today, concluded "on the basis of this direct experience and our knowledge of the country and its people" that the massive military intervention is a "grave mistake" that "may be counterproductive in the long if not the short run," interrupting and disrupting the processes of reconstruction that "have been undertaken among traditional leaders facilitated by Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun of the United Nations and others, to try to build peace from below." Apparently reflecting similar perceptions, the International Red Cross (ICRC), which played by far the greatest part in responding to the terrible famine that peaked in summer 1992, refused to accept U.S. military escorts for fear that this would disrupt arrangements that hail been developing within Somali civil society. The British government pressured Oxfam and Save the Children, both dependent on government support, to call off their criticisms of the intervention.

<P>Many expressed particular concern over U.S. dealings with the leading "warlords," fearing that this may provide greater legitimacy and power to the most dangerous and destructive elements in the society. They seem to agree. Both General Mohammed Farrar Aideed the most powerful of these killers, and his ally Col. Omar Jess, who massacred over 100 civilian leaders in Kismayu in preparation for the arrival of the marines, "want to deal solely with the U.S.," Julian Onne comments in the <CITE>Financial Times,</CITE> reporting on a protest by 500 demonstrators loyal to Aideed that disrupted the visit of UN Secretary General Boutros Ghali to Mogadishu, which Aideed controls.

<P>There is good reason to believe that a more modulated approach in cooperation with Somali civil society could have been effective in enhancing the recovery already underway, along lines that have been presented by Omaar de Waal, and other close observers. The military operation that was so "eagerly advertised" may prove beneficial or harmful to Somalis in the long run, but that is incidental; they are basically props for photo opportunities.

<P>In the UK, as here, it is commonly felt necessary to include ritual phrases about the "humanitarian mission" in analyses of actual motives. Economic correspondent Michael Prowse of the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> describes the Somali intervention in these terms: "in the absence of the communist threat, the most reliable way to sustain public support for large military expenditures may be to base foreign policy on values the public holds dear. In today's changed world [the Soviet threat having vanished], Mr. Clinton is thus being a realist, as much as an idealist, in pledging to make the promotion of democracy and human rights the guiding principles for overseas interventions" -- PR devices that he did not invent, of course. Having exposed the propaganda, Prowse goes on to laud "The heartwarming presence of U.S. troops in Somalia," where, "For the first time in recent U.S. history (perhaps ever), a sizable military intervention overseas was justified on purely moral grounds." A high tolerance for self-contradiction is a virtual necessity for intellectual respectability, given the need to invest the actual workings of power with suitable majesty.

<P>The day after the intervention, in an article on the U.S. economy not mentioning Somalia, Prowse cited U.S. economists in corporate and financial institutions who attribute the sluggishness of recovery from the recession to the decline in military spending, which eliminates a traditional device for stimulating the economy. In brief, the stakes in "sustaining public support for large military expenditures" are high.

<P>According to the official version of the timing presented most fully by Don Oberdorder of the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> on the basis of official leaks, the decision to intervene was taken on November 21 on the grounds that "the need is crying" and "only the United States can do something." That story lacks any credibility; "the need was crying" months earlier, and was declining by late November thanks to the efforts of others.

<P>It is possible that the intervention had been planned for the post-election period. In early November, a marine colonel in civilian clothes was seen by reporters in Baidoa, apparently scouting out the area where a major base would be established; at the time, U.S. military personnel were restricted to the cargo planes delivering supplies. A "humanitarian intervention" just before election day would have seemed too cynical a ploy, undermining the PR function. An earlier intervention would have faced two problems. The first is that the situation had not yet begun to settle. The operation would have been far more risky, and it was not so obvious then that the appearance of success could be quickly achieved; similar considerations rule out "humanitarian intervention" in Bosnia, even more strongly. Second, it is widely felt that things might go sour after the initial PR bonanza, and the Administration surely did not want to face such problems under the glare of election klieglights. The post-election timing is preferable. Order was being restored so the appearance of success is more likely. Bush's term can end in a blaze of glory. If the "purely idealistic" effort turns into the usual disaster, on the model of Grenada, Panama, and so on, attention will have waned or someone else will have to pick up the pieces and suffer the political consequences.

<P>As in earlier efforts to sustain the Pentagon system, the Somali intervention may serve other purposes. The U.S. supported Siad Barre through his worst atrocities because of its interest in Somali bases for the intervention forces aimed at the Middle East and for possible operations in Africa; such considerations might remain of some importance (not much, I suspect, alternatives being readily available). Furthermore, in large parts of Africa and the Middle East the rise of Islamic fundamentalism (which may well be accelerated by the intervention) is a matter of growing concern, for traditional reasons: like secular nationalist tendencies, liberation theology, labor and peasant organizing, democratic socialist political initiatives, some military regimes, and other potentially independent forces, Islamic fundamentalism falls under the rubric of "ultranationalism," a term that covers any threat of deviation from the subordinate role assigned to the service areas, whatever its political coloration. Nevertheless, it seems likely that at the current moment, the prevailing factor is the domestic one, the crisis of state industrial policy, as the more serious commentary and reporting often indicates obliquely.


<H3>Industrial Policy for the 1990s</H3>

<P>The decline of the traditional form of industrial strategy is a serious matter. To convince the taxpayer to subsidize advanced industry by the methods designed in the early postwar years is becoming increasingly difficult. It is not surprising, then, that we now hear open discussion of the need for "industrial policy" -- that is, new forms, no longer masked by the Pentagon system.

<P>The old methods were running into difficulties for reasons beyond the loss of the standard pretext and the erosion of tolerance on the part of people suffering the effects of Reaganite spend-and-borrow abandon. The Pentagon system of industrial subsidy and planning has obvious inefficiencies. These were tolerable in the days of overwhelming U.S. economic dominance, less so as U.S.-based corporations face serious competitors who can design and produce directly for the commercial market, not awaiting possible spin-offs from high tech weapons or space shots. Furthermore, the cutting edge of industrial development is shifting to biology-based technology. That is one reason why the West, with the U.S. in the lead, is insisting that GATT agreements and NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) provide enhanced protection for patents ("intellectual property"), thus locking the Third World into dependency on high-priced products of Western agribusiness, biotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry, and so on. It is important to ensure that TNCs control seeds, plant varieties, drugs, and the means of life generally; by comparison, electronics deals with frills. Public subsidy and state protection for biology-based industries can not easily be hidden behind a Pentagon cover. For such reasons alone, new forms of state intervention are required (see <A HREF="../year/year.html">Year 501</A>, South End Press).

<P>In the 1992 electoral campaign, the Democrats showed more awareness of these issues, gaining support from sectors of the corporate world that recognized them to be more attuned to real world problems than Reaganite ideologues. Not that Reaganites were reluctant to use state power to protect the wealthy from market forces. The primary mechanisms were the usual military Keynesian ones. To mention one striking case, a 1985 OECD study found that the Pentagon and Japan's state planning ministry MITI were distributing R&D funds much the same way, making similar guesses about new technologies. A major Pentagon funnel was SDI ("Star Wars"), which was openly advertised as a state subsidy to the "private sector," and lauded by the business press for that reason. The Reagan-Bush decade ended in fall 1992 with a well-publicized improvement in the economy, attributed in the business press to a sharp rise in military spending much of it for computer purchases. While almost all industrial societies became more protectionist in past years, at great cost to the Third World, the Reaganites led the pack, introducing more import restrictions than all postwar administrations combined. British MP Phillip Oppenheim, ridiculing Anglo-American posturing about "liberal market capitalism," notes that "A World Bank survey of non-tariff barriers showed that they covered 9 per cent of all goods in Japan -- compared with 34 per cent in the U.S. -- figures reinforced by David Henderson of the OECD, who stated that during the 1980s the U.S. had the worst record for devising new non-tariff barriers" (basically, ways to strong-arm competitors). He adds that OECD figures show U.S. state funding for non-military R&D to be about one-third of all civil research spending, as compared to 2 percent state funding in Japan. The Thatcher record is similar.

<P>The Reaganites also conducted the biggest nationalization in U.S. history (the Continental Illinois Bank bailout) and enabled the steel industry to reconstruct by effectively barring imports and undermining unions to reduce labor costs. They are leaving Washington with heavy new restrictions on European Community steel exports that the EC claims violate international trade rules; Washington's justification is alleged EC dumping, but the EC responds that total EC steel exports had fallen below the "voluntary quota" (the Reaganite non-tariff barrier). The Reagan administration sharply increased export-promotion by means of Export-Import bank credits in apparent "violation of the GATT," Eximbank chair John Macomber concedes. They conducted "what was effectively an `industrial policy'" (contrary to official rhetoric) that rebuilt the U.S. computer chip industry by such means as an agreement "essentially forced on Japan" to increase purchases of U.S. chips and by establishment of the government-industry consortium Sematech to improve manufacturing technology, the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> reported, quoting Charles White, vice president for strategic planning at Motorola, the second-biggest U.S. chip maker, who said: "You can't underestimate the government's role."

<P>Despite such achievements, the Reagan-Bush faction remains hampered by ideological extremism, unable to face current problems of industrial strategy as directly as their political opponents, some elements of the corporate-financial world assume. Clintonite thinking on this issue is reflected in the choice of Berkeley Professor Laura Tyson as Chairperson of the Council of Economic Advisors. Tyson was a founder and codirector of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy, a corporate-funded trade and technology research institute that advocates unconcealed state industrial policy. She has "longstanding relationships with Silicon Valley companies that stand to benefit from the policies she advocates," <CITE>Times</CITE> business correspondent Sylvia Nasar notes. In support of these policies, Roundtable co-director Michael Borrus cites a 1988 Department of Commerce study showing that "five of the top six fastest growing U.S. industries from 1972 to 1988 were sponsored or sustained, directly or indirectly, by federal investment," the only exception being lithographic services. "The winners" in earlier years, he writes, "computers, biotechnology, jet engines, and airframes were each the by-product of public spending for national defense and public health." The record goes back to the earliest days; "defense" and "public health" are the familiar Newspeak disguises, perhaps a shade less deceptive than "free market neoliberalism."

<P>Such familiar lessons of economic history can no longer be concealed, as the Pentagon system and the Cold War ideology have eroded. The interventionist measures of the Reaganites reflect these needs, as does the increasingly open discussion of "industrial policy." A recent study of the National Academy of Sciences and Engineering proposed a $5 billion quasi-governmental company "to channel federal money into private applied research"; that is, publicly-funded research that will yield private profit. Another report, entitled The Government Role in Civilian Technology: Building a New Alliance, calls for new efforts to extend "the close and longstanding" government-industry relationship that has "helped to establish the commercial biotechnology industry." It recommends a government-funded "Civilian Technology Corporation" to assist U.S. industry to commercialize technology by encouraging "cooperative R&D ventures in pre-commercial areas"; "pre-commercial," to ensure that profit is restricted to private wealth and power. The ventures will be "cooperative," with the public paying the costs up to the point of product development. At that point costs change to gains, and the public hands the enterprise over to private industry, the traditional pattern.

<P>"America cannot continue to rely on trickle-down technology from the military," Clinton stated in a document issued by his campaign headquarters in September 1992 ("Technology: The Engine of Economic Growth"). The old game is ending. In the "new era" planned by the Clinton administration, <CITE>Times</CITE> science writer William Broad reports, "the Government's focus on making armaments will shift to fostering a host of new civilian technologies and industries" -- just as in the "old era," but then behind the Pentagon mask. "President Clinton proposes to redirect $76 billion or so in annual Federal research spending so it spurs industrial innovation" in emerging technologies -- which, in unmentionable fact, were largely funded through the Pentagon system (and the National Institute of Health) in the "old era." A minimum of $30 billion is to be taken from the Pentagon's research budget as a "peace dividend" over four years for these purposes, Broad writes, noting that: "Significantly, the initiative would spend the same amount of money as Star Wars, $30 billion, in half the time. "

<P>Also significantly, Clinton's advisers knew all along that Star Wars was "only tangentially related to national defense" that its prime function was to serve as "a path to competitiveness in advanced technologies," as publicly explained in Congressional Hearings (Clinton's close associate Robert Reich, now Secretary of Labor, writing in 1985 in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> under the heading "High Tech, a Subsidiary of Pentagon Inc."). As noted earlier, the function of Star Wars as part of the system of public subsidy, private profit, was made clear to the business world from the start, though largely concealed from the general public by the doctrinal managers.

<P>The <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reports a study by Battelle Memorial Institute showing that research spending will remain sluggish because of "a slowdown in weapons development." "Government spending over the past five years has swung toward space and energy programs, and away from weapons development" the principal author of the report said. That is government spending (the public subsidy) shifted from one component of the Pentagon system to the others.

<P>"We're now going to develop an economic strategy much in the way we developed a national security strategy to fight the cold war," Kent Hughes, president of Clinton s Council on Competitiveness, proclaimed. It is necessary only to bring out the striking continuities as old policies are adapted to new contingencies, and to reinterpret the "cold war" as what it was. A related matter is the traditional business demand that the public via government, pay the costs of the infrastructure required for private power and profit, everything from roads to education. By now, even such enthusiasts for Reagan's party for the rich as the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> are concerned by the consequences of the policies they advocated, such as the deterioration of the state college systems that supplied the needs of the corporate sector. "Public higher education -- one the few areas where America still ranks supreme -- is being pounded by state spending cuts," the Journal worriedly reports, echoing the concerns of businesses that "rely heavily on a steady stream of graduates" for skilled personnel and on applied research that they can exploit. This is one of the long-predicted consequences of the cutback of federal services for all but the wealthy and powerful, which devastated states and local communities. Class war is not easy to fine tune.

<P>That Clinton will be able to address these problems is not at all clear. Frivolous Reaganite policies left the country deeply in debt at all levels, from the federal government to households. Interest on the federal debt has skyrocketed, now reaching the scale of the days when the costs of the World War had to be faced. Had the borrowing been used for productive investment or R&D, it could have been justified. But it was not. Rather, it was largely frittered away in luxury consumption, financial manipulations and swindles, and other Yuppie fun-and-games-much as in Thatcherite England, the other "revolution" much admired by the privileged. A National Science Foundation study at the peak of the mania estimated that R&D expenditures declined by 5 percent for companies involved in mergers and acquisitions compared to a 5 percent rise for others. Meanwhile real wages declined, hunger and deep poverty rose rapidly, the jail population zoomed, and the society began to take on a distinct Third World aspect. Given the debt, even the kinds of "moderate increase in infrastructure spending" and other devices that Clinton advisers are willing to contemplate, reflecting business concerns, may not be feasible.


<H3>Who Decides? For Whom?</H3>

<P>The standard rhetorical cloak for the new "economic strategy" is that its goal is to provide jobs. That is not false, as long as we recall the meaning of the term "jobs" in Politically Correct Newspeak. Whether the strategy will provide jobs, and for whom, is debatable. What is not debatable is that the driving concern remains the unmentionable seven-letter word, and that the public is to be excluded, completely, from any participation in formulating this "economic strategy." The latter principle follows from the guiding doctrine of elite democratic theory: the public are to be spectators, not participants in managing public affairs, which are none of their business. The urgency of preserving this principle is highlighted by the curious confusions that the public manifests, reviewed earlier.

<P>The guiding doctrines, of course, have far more general application. To mention one interesting case, in Poland "Public resistance to privatization, especially among workers, has been evident since early in the post-Communist period," the director of Russian and East European studies at George Washington University, Sharon Wolchik, observes: "A 1990 survey, for example, found that only 13 percent of workers, but 37 percent of directors, favored private ownership of their enterprise," with over one-third of both workers and directors favoring state and employee ownership. But the attitudes of the population are inconsequential in the "new democracies" -- one reason, perhaps, why "the Communist era is looking better and better" to Poles, as another academic specialist observes (Jane Leftwich Curry).

<P>Whether in Somalia, or Poland, or any other choice that one may make, the concerns of the general population are as incidental to the architects of policy as in the days of Adam Smith's England. And crucially, the rabble must be kept from interfering with the plans that will determine their fate.

<P>While state managers may attempt to adapt the traditional devices of public subsidy and protection to new contingencies, they will surely continue to support the main lines of policy: extending the globalization of the economy and establishing more firmly the decision-making apparatus that is taking shape to serve the interests of the supranational industrial and financial institutions. These are important features of the current era, discussed in earlier articles here (see my <CITE>Z</CITE> articles in May, July/August, <!-- HREF HERE>November, and Edward Herman's "Doublespeak," November 1992).

<P>Nixon's dismantling of the international economic system was one of several factors leading to a huge increase in unregulated capital, beyond the power of governments to control. The rich societies are no longer immune, as European central banks learned a few months ago. Even the United States, still the world's largest economy and most powerful state, is facing these problems. The U.S. can freely disregard lMF "advice" as the Bush administration showed in October when the IMF prescribed deficit-cutting measures including new taxes, and "fundamental" health care reforms -- the kind of "advice" on structural adjustment that amounts to orders for the Third World, however harmful the consequences, Doug Henwood notes, reporting the U.S. rejection. But it is not beyond the reach of international bond investors, who "may now hold unprecedented power -- perhaps even a veto-over U.S. economic policy," the Wall Street Journal reported immediately after the election. This consequence of the huge Reagan-Bush deficit will serve as brake on any odd ideas that Clinton advisers might have about spending, the Journal noted reassuringly; spending of the wrong kind, that is, not directed to the needs of "the country," in the technical sense.

<P>Related developments of the past several decades have accelerated the globalization of the economy, along with its immediate corollary: a growing superfluous population at home as production shifts to high repression, low wage areas (and, at the same time, productivity gains reduce the need for industrial workers). The superfluous people are becoming less significant as a market as well. Increasingly, production can be shifted to poor and oppressed populations and directed to the relatively wealthy, a small sector in the traditional Third World, a far larger one in the advanced industrial societies. The model pioneered by Henry Ford -- wages high enough for domestic workers to provide a market -- may decline along with the national economies on which it was based. Rhetoric aside, these are not likely to be serious concerns of the "principal architects" of policy, any more than they have been in the past.

<P>The reversion of much of East Europe to its traditional Third World status offers new weapons against U.S. workers (and Western workers generally). As widely reported, GM plans to close two dozen plants in the U.S. and Canada. Meanwhile it bas opened a $690 million assembly plant in East Germany with great expectations, heightened by the fact that, thanks to 43 percent unofficial unemployment, workers are willing to "work longer hours than their pampered colleagues in western Germany" at 40 percent of the wage and with few benefits, the <CITE>Financial Times</CITE> cheerily explains. Capital can readily move; people cannot, or are not permitted to by those who applaud Adam Smith's doctrines when it suits their needs. Jobs may disappear in the West; "jobs" in the technical sense will do just fine.

<P>The U.S. (like other states) will continue to defend U.S.-based corporate and financial interests while seeking to maintain a global environment in which they can flourish. That requires, in particular, that the Third World be kept in its service role. Meanwhile at home, state power will continue to be employed to dissolve popular structures (unions, etc.) that might serve the needs of the general public and enable them to interfere illegitimately in the management of public affairs It will also be necessary to find ways to control the growing "Third World at home," no small problem. The Clinton Mandate for Change promises no change in these respects.

<P>Much of world trade (close to half, by some estimates) consists of intrafirm transfers -- centrally managed trade, internal to particular TNCs and guided by a highly "visible hand," to borrow the phrase of business historian Alfred Chandler. In an important critical analysis of the GATT World Bank economists Herman Daly and Robert Goodland point out that in prevailing economic theory, "firms are islands of central planning in a sea of market relationships." "As the islands get bigger" they add, "there is really no reason to claim victory for the market principle" -- particularly as the islands approach the scale of the sea, which departs radically from free market principles, and always has, because the powerful will not submit to these destructive rules.

<P>As in the past, political institutions are taking shape to reflect the realities of private economic power: the IMF and World Bank, G-7, NAFTA, and other elements of the "de facto world government" described by the international financial press as the executive for the "new imperial age." These processes allow major decisions to be insulated from parliamentary institutions, which may be infected by public influence This important development carries forward the long-term project of safeguarding wealth and privilege from public interference and overcoming the threat that democratic forms might have actual substance. Increasingly, the general public are not even aware of major decisions that will determine their fate, hence are in no position to influence them. A good part of the popular concern in Europe over instituting EC structures has to do with "the democratic deficit," "the fact that policies escape parliamentary control at the national level and do not come under equivalent control at the Community level" (John Lambert). The same problems are arising here, though they are less discussed in our more depoliticized society.

<P>Neither at home nor abroad does the real world bear much resemblance to the dreamy fantasies now fashionable among intellectuals about History converging to an ideal of liberal democracy that is the ultimate realization of Freedom. Consider NAFTA. One may debate the consequences, but no one doubts that they will be large in scale. The NAFTA is an executive agreement reached on August 12, 1992, just in time to become a major issue in the electoral campaign. It was mentioned but barely. The Trade Act of 1974 established a Labor Advisory Committee (IAC), based in the unions, which is required by law to provide advice and information to the executive branch before any trade agreement is reached. The LAC was advised that its report was due on September 9, J992. A complete draft of the text of this elaborate treaty was made available one day before, on September 8, making it impossible for the LAC to formally meet, as directed by law. One could hardly con conjure up a more striking example of utter contempt for democracy. Furthermore, the LAC notes, "the administration refused to permit any outside advice on the development of this document and refused to make a draft available for comment."

<P>The situation in Canada was similar. The British Columbia Teachers Federation wrote a sharply critical report on the treaty draft noting the "impossible limitations on the operation of this committee, "with absurd time constraints and exclusion of entire provinces from any review of the lengthy and complex executive agreement.

<P>Despite the contemptuous dismissal of both the law and the public, LAC did provide a review of NAFTA, concluding that while the treaty would be a bonanza to investors (as all agree), it would severely harm American workers (about 70 percent of them, even by the analysis of the advocates). It will also very likely harm Mexican workers as well, the LAC report notes, as do other studies. One predicted consequence of the agreement is a rapid increase in rural migration to urban areas as Mexican corn producers are wiped out by U.S. agribusiness exports, depressing still further wages that have fallen some 60 percent during the past decade and are likely to remain low, thanks to the harsh repression of labor that is a crucial part of the highly-touted Mexican "economic miracle." Property rights are well protected by the agreement, LAC and other analysts note, while workers' rights are ignored.

<P>The treaty is also likely to have harmful environmental consequences; production can shift to regions where enforcement of laws is lax or non-existent, and regulations imposed by parliamentary bodies can be overridden as "unfair restraint of trade," processes already underway in the Framework of the U.S.-Canada "Free trade" agreement. In general, the LAC report concludes, "U.S. corporations, and the owners and managers of these corporations, stand to reap enormous profits. The United States as a whole, however, stands to lose an enormous amount." The country will suffer, "the country" -- in the Newspeak sense -- will, again, do just fine.

<P>On a wide range of issues, the LAC report observes, NAFTA "will have the effect of prohibiting democratically elected bodies at [federal, state, and local levels of government from enacting measures deemed inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement," including measures on the environment, workers' rights, health and safety, etc. The LAC report calls for the treaty to be renegotiated, offering a series of constructive proposals.

<P>Neither the contents of this important critical analysis, nor the scorn for law and democracy shown by the Bush administration, were reported. These matters are of no interest to the ideological institutions, or more accurately, are of negative interest -- suppression is necessary, in the interests of "the country." Citizens know next to nothing; indeed, subversion of democracy has reached such remarkable heights that they do not even know that they know nothing. Congress abdicated responsibility. The Clinton camp had little to say. In such ways, we can approach the long-sought ideal: formal democratic procedures that are utterly devoid of meaning, as citizens not only do not intrude into the public arena, but have scarcely an idea of the policies that will shape their lives.

<P>It is a striking fact that although these critical issues have been kept almost entirely out of the public domain, 60 percent of the public do have an opinion about NAFTA, opposing it by nearly 2-to-1 in October 1992. As usual, that was irrelevant to the presidential campaign, then in its final weeks. It was enough, however, to frighten the <CITE>Wall Street Journal,</CITE> which ran a fevered front-page story warning of the "diverse coalition of grass-roots foes" that is "fighting `Nafta'," including the labor movement, populist farm groups, and environmental and religious organizations. These dangerous elements "hit pay dirt," the Journal reports ominously, receiving funds (a magnificent $50,000) from a branch of the Unitarian Church.

<P>The corporate world is, naturally, shaking in its boots at the thought that its monopoly might be challenged. The lesson for the rest of us is obvious.

<P>More generally, people have little specific knowledge of what is happening around them. An academic study that appeared right before the presidential election reports that less than 30 percent of the population was aware of the positions of the candidates on major issues, though 86 percent knew the name of George Bush's dog. The general thrust of propaganda gets through, however. When asked to identify the largest element of the federal budget, less than 1/4 give the correct answer, military spending. Almost half select foreign aid, which barely exists; the second choice is welfare, chosen by 1/3 of the population, who also far overestimate the proportion that goes to blacks and to child support. And though the question was not asked, virtually none are likely to be aware that "defense spending" is in large measure welfare for the rich. Another result of the study is that more educated sectors are more ignorant -- not surprising, since they are the main targets of indoctrination. Bush supporters, who are the best educated scored lowest overall. The study also shows that Republican propaganda (however fraudulent) passed through the media with greater effect than the Democrats counterpart, an inconvenience for the charges of "liberal bias" that are particularly relished by the liberal media, which -- as usual -- greatly appreciate such condemnation as a tribute to their fiery independence of power.

<P>With regard to all of these issues, two distinct questions arise. What will be the likely consequences of the policies under consideration? Who decides? The answer to the second question is clear: the "principal architects" of policy are the traditional ones. The public has essentially no role, and with the recent advances in destruction of democracy, no knowledge.

<P>As noted, the first question can be debated. Perhaps, as the scant media coverage generally takes for granted reflexively, the NAFTA will benefit all; the Clinton and the Reagan-Bush factions are earnestly seeking to improve the lives and prospects of the general public, differing only on how to achieve this result; all are committed to free trade, which is obviously the greater good; etc. Maybe there really is a tooth fairy. Perhaps. No matter what one believes, it cannot be doubted that the policy questions require careful scrutiny and analysis. And that they will not receive, certainly not on the part of those whose lives and fate are at stake, unless they organize to do something about it.

</CENTER>


<P>In the July/August issue of <CITE>Z,</CITE> several articles dealt with the deterioration of conditions of life in American society and the loss of hope, trust, or even expectations for the political system. Reviewing some of these all-too-obvious elements of the current scene, I wrote that "The public is not unaware of what is happening, though with the success of the policies of isolation and breakdown of organizational structure, the response is erratic and dangerous: faith in ridiculous billionaire saviors who are little more than `blank slates' on which one can write one's favorite dreams, myths of past innocence and noble leaders, conspiracy cults..., unfocused skepticism and disillusionment -- a mixture that has not had happy consequences in the past."

<P>At times of general malaise and social breakdown, it is not uncommon for millenarian movements to arise to replace lost hopes by idle dreams: dreams of a savior who will lead us from bondage, or of the return of the great ships with their bounty, as in the cargo cults of South Sea islanders. Some may yearn for a lost golden age, or succumb to the blandishments of the new Messiahs who come to the fore at such moments. Those more cognizant of the institutional causes of discontent may be attracted to an image of hope destroyed by dark and powerful forces that stole from us the leader who sought a better future. The temptation to seek solace, or salvation, is particularly strong when the means to become engaged in a constructive way in determining one's fate have largely dissolved and disappeared.

<P>The billionaire savior has retreated from the scene. But it is surely striking that his challenge to the one-party, two-faction system of business rule, with its broad popular appeal, should have coincided so closely with the revival of fascination with tales of intrigue about Camelot lost. The audiences differ, but the JFK-Perot enthusiasms are similar enough to raise the question whether the imagery of the leader maliciously stolen from us has more of a claim to reality than the promise of the figure who suddenly appeared, quickly to fade away. The question is an important one, particularly to the left (broadly construed), which has devoted much of its valuable energy and resources to the Kennedy revival at a time when it has been successfully removed from the political arena, along with the large majority of the public that is its natural constituency.

<P>The core issue in the current Kennedy revival is the claim that JFK intended to withdraw from Vietnam, a fact suppressed by the media; and was assassinated for that reason, it is prominently charged. Some allege further that Kennedy was intent on destroying the CIA, dismantling the military-industrial complex, ending the Cold War, and opening an era of development and freedom for Latin America, among other forms of class treachery that led to his downfall. This 1991-2 drama proceeded at several levels, from cinema to scholarship, engaging some of the best-known Kennedy intellectuals as well as substantial segments of the popular movements that in large part grew from opposition to the Vietnam war. Much as they differ on parts of the picture and other issues, there is a shared belief across this spectrum that history changed course dramatically when Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, an event that casts a grim shadow over all that followed.

<P>It is also striking that the withdrawal thesis, which is at the heart of the Camelot revival of 1991-2, gained its prominence just on the 30th anniversary of Kennedy's steps to escalate the Indochina conflict from international terrorism to outright aggression. The anniversary of Kennedy's war against the rural society of South Vietnam passed virtually without notice, as the country mused over the evil nature of the Japanese, who had so signally failed to plead for forgiveness on the 50th anniversary of their attack on a military base in a US colony that had been stolen from its inhabitants, by force and guile, just 50 years earlier.

<P>There are several sources of evidence that bear on the withdrawal thesis: (1) The historical facts; (2) the record of public statements; (3) the internal planning record; (4) the memoirs and other reports of Kennedy insiders. In each category, the material is substantial. The record of internal deliberations, in particular, has been available far beyond the norm since the release of two editions of the <CITE>Pentagon Papers</CITE> (<CITE>PP</CITE>). The recent publication of thousands of pages of documents in the official State Department history provides a wealth of additional material on the years of the presidential transition, 1963-4, which are of crucial significance for evaluating the thesis that many have found so compelling. What follows is an excerpt from a much longer review of the four categories of evidence in a broader context (<CITE>Year 501,</CITE> South End, forthcoming).

<P>While history never permits anything like definitive conclusions, in this case, the richness of the record, and its consistency, permit some unusually confident judgments. In my opinion, the record is inconsistent with the withdrawal thesis throughout, and supports a different conclusion. In brief, basic policy towards Indochina developed within a framework of North-South/East-West relations that Kennedy did not challenge, and remained constant in essentials: disentanglement from an unpopular and costly venture as soon as possible, but <I>after</I> victory was assured (by the end, with increasing doubt that US client regimes could be sustained). Tactics were modified with changing circumstances and perceptions. Changes of Administration, including the Kennedy assassination, had no large-scale effect on policy, and not even any great effect on tactics, when account is taken of the objective situation and how it was perceived.  

<H3>Kennedy's War</H3>

<P>When JFK took over in 1961, the US client regimes faced collapse in both Laos and Vietnam, for the same reason in both countries: The US-imposed regimes could not compete politically with the well-organized popular opposition, a fact recognized on all sides. Kennedy accepted a diplomatic settlement in Laos (at least on paper), but chose to escalate in Vietnam, where he ordered the deployment of Air Force and Helicopter Units, along with napalm, defoliation, and crop destruction. US military personnel were sharply increased and deployed at battalion level, where they were "beginning to participate more directly in advising Vietnamese unit commanders in the planning and execution of military operations plans" (<CITE>PP</CITE>). Kennedy's war far surpassed the French war at its peak in helicopters and aerial fire power. As for personnel, France had 20,000 nationals fighting in all of Indochina in 1949 (the US force level reached 16,700 under JFK), increasing to 57,000 at the peak.

<P>As military operations intensified, concerns arose over the effects of "indiscriminate firepower" and reports "that indiscriminate bombing in the countryside is forcing innocent or wavering peasants toward the Viet Cong" (<CITE>PP</CITE>). Kennedy's more dovish advisers, notably Roger Hilsman, preferred counterintersurgency operations. The favored method was to drive several million peasants into concentration camps where, surrounded by barbed wire and troops, they would have a "free choice" between the US client regime (GVN) and the Viet Cong. The effort failed, Hilsman later concluded, because it was never possible to eliminate the political opposition entirely. Other problems arose when the wrong village was bombed, or when bombing and defoliation alienated the peasants whose hearts and minds were to be won from the enemy whom they supported.

<P>Kennedy's war was no secret. In March 1962, US officials announced that US pilots were engaged in combat missions (bombing and strafing). In October, a front-page story in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reported that "in 30 percent of all the combat missions flown in Vietnamese Air Force planes, Americans are at the controls," though "national insignia have been erased from many aircraft...to avoid the thorny international problems involved." The press reported further that US Army fliers and gunners were taking the military initiative against southern guerrillas, using helicopters with more firepower than any World War II fighter plane as an offensive weapon. Armed helicopters were regularly supporting operations of the Saigon army (ARVN). The brutal character of Kennedy's war was also no secret, from the outset.

<P>The specialist literature, notably province studies, generally agrees that the US-imposed regime had no legitimacy in the countryside, where 80% of the population lived (and little enough in the urban areas), that only force could compensate for this lack, and that by 1965 the VC had won the war in much of the country, with little external support.

<P>At first, JFK's 1961-2 aggression appeared to be a grand success: by July 1962, "the prospects looked bright" and "to many the end of the insurgency seemed in sight." The US leadership in Vietnam and Washington "was confident and cautiously optimistic," and "In some quarters, even a measure of euphoria obtained" (<CITE>PP</CITE>).

<P>In his semi-official history of Kennedy's presidency, Arthur Schlesinger observes that by the end of 1961, "The President unquestionably felt that an American retreat in Asia might upset the whole world balance" (<CITE>A Thousand Days,</CITE> 1965). "The result in 1962 was to place the main emphasis on the military effort" in South Vietnam. The "encouraging effects" of the escalation enabled Kennedy to report in his January 1963 State of the Union message that "The spearpoint of aggression has been blunted in South Vietnam." In Schlesinger's own words: "1962 had not been a bad year: ...aggression checked in Vietnam."

<P>Recall that Kennedy and his historian-associate are describing the year 1962, when Kennedy escalated from extreme terrorism to outright aggression.

<P>Turning briefly to the second category of evidence, public statements, we find that Schlesinger's report of the President's feelings is well-confirmed. JFK regularly stressed the enormous stakes involved, which made any thought of withdrawal unacceptable. To the end, his public position was that we must "win the war" and not "just go home and leave the world to those who are our enemies." We must ensure that "the assault from the inside, and which is manipulated from the North, is ended" (Sept., Nov. 1963). Anything less would lead to the loss of Southeast Asia, with repercussions extending far beyond. As the "watchman on the walls of world freedom," he intended to tell his Dallas audience on Nov. 22, the US had to undertake tasks that were "painful, risky and costly, as is true in Southeast Asia today. But we dare not weary of the task." The internal record, to which we turn next, shows that he adopted the same stance in his (limited) involvement in planning.  

<H3>JFK and Withdrawal: the Early Plans</H3>

<P>The optimistic mid-1962 assessment led Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, the primary war manager for Kennedy and Johnson, to initiate planning for the withdrawal of US forces from Vietnam, leaving to the client regime the dirty work of cleaning up the remnants. Kennedy and McNamara recognized that domestic support for the war was thin, and that problems might arise if it were to persist too long. Similarly, in November 1967, General Westmoreland announced that with victory imminent, US troops could begin to withdraw in 1969 (as happened, though under circumstances that he did not anticipate); that recommendation does not show that he was a secret dove. Advocacy of withdrawal after assurance of victory was not a controversial stand.

<P>In contrast, withdrawal <I>without victory</I> would have been highly controversial. That position received scant support until well after the Tet offensive of January 1968, when corporate and political elites determined that the operation should be liquidated, in large part because of the social costs of protest.

<P>The question to be considered, then, is whether JFK, despite his 1961-2 escalation and his militant public stand, planned to withdraw <I>without</I> victory, a plan aborted by the assassination, which cleared the way for Lyndon Johnson and his fellow-warmongers to bring on a major war. If so, one may inquire further into whether this was a factor in the assassination.

<P>The withdrawal decisions were reported at once in the press with fair accuracy, and the basic facts about the internal deliberations lying behind them became known 20 years ago when the <CITE>Pentagon Papers</CITE> appeared. In July 1962, the analyst writes, "At the behest of the President, the Secretary of Defense undertook to reexamine the situation [in Vietnam] and address himself to its future -- with a view to assuring that it be brought to a successful conclusion within a reasonable time." McNamara declared himself impressed with the "tremendous progress" that had been made, and called for "phasing out major U.S. advisory and logistic support activities." General Paul Harkins (commander of the US military mission) estimated that the VC should be "eliminated as a significant force" about a year after the Vietnamese forces then being trained and equipped "became fully operational." McNamara, however, insisted upon "a conservative view": planning should be based on the assumption that "it would take three years instead of one, that is, by the latter part of 1965." He also "observed that it might be difficult to retain public support for U.S. operations in Vietnam indefinitely," a constant concern. Therefore, it was necessary "to phase out U.S. military involvement." The Joint Chiefs ordered preparation of a plan to implement these decisions. The operative assumption was that "The insurgency will be under control" by the end of 1965.

<P>On January 25, 1963, General Harkins' plan was presented to the Joint Chiefs, stating that "the phase-out of the US special military assistance is envisioned as generally occurring during the period July 1965-June 1966," earlier where feasible. A few days later, the Chiefs were reassured that this was the right course by a report by a JCS investigative team headed by Army Chief of Staff Earle Wheeler that included leading military hawks. Its report was generally upbeat and optimistic. The anticipated success of current plans to intensify military operations would allow a "concurrent phase-out of United States support personnel, leaving a Military Assistance Advisory Group of about 1,600 personnel" by 1965. All of this was considered feasible and appropriate by the top military command.

<P>Wheeler then reported directly to the President, informing him "that things were going well in Vietnam militarily, but that `Ho Chi Minh was fighting the war for peanuts and if we ever expected to win that affair out there, we had to make him bleed a little bit'." The President "was quite interested in this," General Wheeler recalled in oral history (July 1964). His dovish advisers were also impressed. In April 1963, Hilsman proposed to "continue the covert, or at least deniable, operations along the general lines we have been following for some months" against North Vietnam with the objective of "keeping the threat of eventual destruction alive in Hanoi's mind." But "significant action against North Vietnam" is unwise on tactical grounds: it should be delayed until "we have demonstrated success in our counter-insurgency program." Such "premature action" might also "so alarm our friends and allies and a significant segment of domestic opinion that the pressures for neutralization will become formidable"; as always, the dread threat of diplomacy must be deflected. With judicious planning, Hilsman said, "I believe we can win in Viet-Nam."

<P>Hilsman was not quite as optimistic as the military command. A few days before the President heard Wheeler's upbeat report, he received a memorandum from Hilsman and Forrestal (Jan. 25) that was more qualified. They condemned the press for undue pessimism and underplaying US success, and agreed that "The war in South Vietnam is clearly going better than it was a year ago," praising ARVN's "increased aggressiveness" resulting from the US military escalation, and reporting that GVN control now extended to over half the rural population (the VC controlling 8%), a considerable gain through late 1962. But "the negative side of the ledger is still awesome." The VC had increased their regular forces, recruiting locally and supplied locally, and are "extremely effective." "Thus the conclusion seems inescapable that the Viet Cong could continue the war effort at the present level, or perhaps increase it, even if the infiltration routes were completely closed." "Our overall judgment, in sum, is that we are probably winning, but certainly more slowly than we had hoped."  They made a variety of technical recommendations to implement the counterinsurgency program more efficiently, with more direct US involvement; and to improve the efficiency of the US mission to accelerate the "Progress toward winning the war."

<P>We thus learn that in early 1963, in an atmosphere of considerable to great optimism, the military initiatives for withdrawal went hand-in-hand with plans for escalation of the war within South Vietnam and possibly intensified actions against North Vietnam. We learn further that such "intelligence and sabotage forays" into North Vietnam were already underway -- since mid-1962 according to McGeorge Bundy. On December 11, 1963, as the new Administration took over, Michael Forrestal (another leading Kennedy dove) confirmed that "For some time the Central Intelligence Agency has been engaged in joint clandestine operations with ARVN against North Vietnam." Journalist William Pfaff reports that in the summer of 1962, at a Special Forces encampment north of Saigon he observed a CIA "patrol loading up in an unmarked C-46 with a Chinese pilot in civilian clothes," taking off for a mission in North Vietnam ("possibly into China itself"), with some "Asians, some Americans or Europeans."

<P>The connection between withdrawal and escalation is readily understandable: successful military actions would enable the GVN to take over the task from the Americans, who could then withdraw with victory secured, satisfying the common intent of the extreme hawks, war manager McNamara, and JFK.

<P>In the following months, the withdrawal plans were carried forward under the same optimistic assumptions, with the agreement of the military, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and General Maxwell Taylor, JFK's most trusted military adviser. The "fundamental objective" remained unchanged, Michael Forrestal advised the President on August 27: the US must "give wholehearted support to the prosecution of the war against the Viet Cong terrorists," and "continue assistance to any government in South Vietnam which shows itself capable of sustaining this effort."

<P>The reference to "any government" relates to increasing Administration concerns over the Diem regime. One factor was that its repression was evoking internal resistance, which was interfering with the war effort. Another was that Diem and his brother Nhu were pressing their demands for US withdrawal with increasing urgency, sometimes in public, including a front-page interview in the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> in May in which Nhu called for withdrawal of half the American military. Administration planners feared that GVN pressures for withdrawal of US forces would become difficult to resist, a danger enhanced by exploratory GVN efforts to reach a diplomatic settlement with the North. The skimpy political base for Kennedy's war would then erode, and the US would be compelled to withdraw without victory.  That option being unacceptable, the Saigon regime had to get on board, or be dismissed.

<H3>JFK and Withdrawal: the D&#233;nouement</H3>

<P>By the end of August, JFK and his most dovish advisers (Averell Harriman, Roger Hilsman, George Ball) agreed that the client government should be overthrown. On August 28, the President "asked the Defense Department to come up with ways of building up the anti-Diem forces in Saigon," and called on his advisers to devise actions in Washington or "in the field which would maximize the chances of the rebel generals." Harriman said that without a coup, "we cannot win the war" and "must withdraw." Hilsman "agreed that we cannot win the war unless Diem is removed," as did Ball, while Robert Kennedy also called for efforts to strengthen the rebel generals. Secretary Rusk warned JFK that "Nhu might call on the North Vietnamese to help him throw out the Americans."

<P>Hilsman urged that if Diem and Nhu make any "Political move toward the DRV (such as opening of neutralization negotiations)," or even hint at such moves, we should "Encourage the generals to move promptly with a coup," and be prepared to "hit the DRV with all that is necessary" if they try to counter our actions, introducing US combat forces to ensure victory for the coup group if necessary. "The important thing is to win the war," Hilsman advised; and that meant getting rid of the Saigon regime, which was dragging its feet and looking for ways out. The President concurred that "our primary objective remains winning war," Rusk cabled to the Saigon Embassy.

<P>The basic principle, unquestioned, is that we must "focus on winning the war" (Hilsman). On September 14, Harriman wrote to Lodge that: "from the President on down everybody is determined to support you and the country team in winning the war against the Viet Cong...there are no quitters here."

<P>In particular, JFK is no quitter. There is not a phrase in the internal record to suggest that this judgment by a high-level Kennedy adviser, at the dovish extreme, should be qualified in any way.

<P>On September 17, President Kennedy instructed Ambassador Lodge to pressure Diem to "get everyone back to work and get them to focus on winning the war," repeating his regular emphasis on victory.  It was particularly important to show military progress because "of need to make effective case with Congress for continued prosecution of the effort," the President added, expressing his constant concern that domestic support for his commitment to military victory was weak. "To meet these needs," he informed Lodge, he was sending his top aides McNamara and Taylor to Vietnam. He emphasized to them that the goal remains "winning the war," adding that "The way to confound the press is to win the war." Like Congress, the press was an enemy because of its lack of enthusiasm for a war to victory and its occasional calls for diplomacy.

<P>McNamara and Taylor were encouraged by what they found. On October 2, they informed the President that "The military campaign has made great progress and continues to progress." They presented a series of recommendations, three of which were later authorized (watered down a bit) in NSAM 263: (1) "An increase in the military tempo" throughout the country so that the military campaign in the Northern and Central areas will be over by the end of 1964, and in the South (the Delta) by the end of 1965; (2) Vietnamese should be trained to take over "essential functions now performed by U.S. military personnel" by the end of 1965, so that "It should be possible to withdraw the bulk of U.S.  personnel by that time"; (3) "the Defense Department should announce in the very near future presently prepared plans to withdraw 1000 U.S. military personnel by the end of 1963" as "an initial step in a long-term program to replace U.S. personnel with trained Vietnamese without impairment of the war effort."

<P>Their report stressed again that the "overriding objective" is victory, a matter "vital to United States security," but that withdrawal could not be too long delayed: "any significant slowing in the rate of progress would surely have a serious effect on U.S. popular support for the U.S. effort." They anticipated victory by the end of 1965. The withdrawal plans were crucially qualified in the usual way: "No further reductions should be made until the requirements of the 1964 campaign become firm," that is, until battlefield success is assured.

<P>Note that lack of popular support for the war was not perceived by JFK and his advisers as providing an opportunity for withdrawal, but rather as a threat to victory.

<P>The NSC met the same day to consider these proposals. The President's role was, as usual, marginal. He repeated that "the major problem was with U.S. public opinion" and, as he had before, balked at the time scale. He opposed a commitment to withdraw some forces in 1963 because "if we were not able to take this action by the end of this year, we would be accused of being over optimistic." McNamara, in contrast, "saw great value in this sentence in order to meet the view of Senator Fulbright and others that we are bogged down forever in Vietnam." The phrase was left as "a part of the McNamara-Taylor report rather than as predictions of the President," who thus remained uncommitted to withdrawal, at his insistence.

<P>A public statement was released to the press, and prominently published, presenting the essence of the McNamara-Taylor recommendations. The statement repeated the standard position that the US will work with the GVN "to deny this country to Communism and to suppress the externally stimulated and supported insurgency of the Viet Cong as promptly as possible," continuing with "Major U.S. assistance in support of this military effort," which is needed only until the insurgency has been suppressed or until the national security forces of the Government of South Viet-Nam are capable of suppressing it."

<P>These decisions were encapsulated in NSAM 263 (Oct. 11), a brief statement in which "The President approved the military recommendations" 1-3 cited above, weakened by one change: that "no formal announcement be made of the implementation of plans to withdraw 1,000 U.S. military personnel by the end of 1963." The final provision of NSAM 263 is JFK's personal instruction to Ambassador Lodge to step up the military effort along with training and arming of new forces, so as to enhance the prospects for victory, on which withdrawal was conditioned.

<P>Note that read literally, NSAM 263 says very little. It approves the McNamara-Taylor recommendations to intensify the war and military training so that "It should be possible to withdraw the bulk of U.S. personnel" by the end of 1965, and includes JFK's personal instructions to Lodge to intensify military action. It does not call for implementing a 1,000 man withdrawal, but rather endorses the third point of the McNamara-Taylor proposal concerning plans for such withdrawal "as an initial step in a long-term program" to be conducted "without impairment of the war effort," deleting their call for formal announcement of these plans.

<P>Presumably, the intent was to implement the withdrawal plans if military conditions allow, but that intent is unstated. The fact might be borne in mind in the light of elaborate later efforts to read great significance into nuances of phrasing so as to demonstrate a dramatic change in policy with the Kennedy-Johnson transition. Adopting these interpretive techniques, we would conclude that NSAM 263 is almost vacuous. I stress that that is not my interpretation; I assume the obvious unstated intention, only suggesting that other documents be treated in the same reasonable manner -- in which case, widely-held beliefs will quickly evaporate.

<P>The picture presented in public at the time requires no significant modification in the light of the huge mass of documents now available, though these make much more clear the President's unwillingness to commit himself to the withdrawal advocated by his war managers for fear that the victory might not be achieved in time, his concerns that domestic opinion might not stay the course, his insistence that withdrawal be conditioned on military victory, and his orders to step up the military effort and to replace the Diem regime by one that will "focus on winning" and not entertain thoughts of US withdrawal and peaceful settlement.

<P>Through October 1963, problems with the GVN continued to mount. Nhu called openly for the Americans to get out completely, only providing aid. Another problem was the lack of "effectiveness of GVN in its relation to its own people." Asked about this, Ambassador Lodge responded in an "Eyes only for the President" communication that "Viet-Nam is not a thoroughly strong police state...because, unlike Hitler's Germany, it is not efficient" and is thus unable to suppress the "large and well-organized underground opponent strongly and ever-freshly motivated by vigorous hatred." The Vietnamese "appear to be more than ever anxious to be left alone," and though they "are said to be capable of great violence on occasion," "there is no sight of it at the present time," another impediment to US efforts.

<P>Small wonder that JFK was unwilling to commit himself to the McNamara-Taylor withdrawal proposal. Note that the same defects of the US clients underlie the critique of the strategic hamlet program by Kennedy doves.

<P>Washington's coup plans continued, with Ambassador Lodge in operational command. The only hesitation was fear of failure. When the coup finally took place on November 1, replacing Diem and Nhu (who were killed) by a military regime, the President praised Lodge effusively for his "fine job" and "leadership," an "achievement...of the greatest importance." With the generals now in power, "our primary emphasis should be on effectiveness rather than upon external appearances," the President added. We must help the coup regime to confront "the real problems of winning the contest against the Communists and holding the confidence of its own people." The "ineffectiveness, loss of popular confidence, and the prospect of defeat that were decisive in shaping our relations to the Diem regime" are now a thing of the past, the President hoped, thanks to Lodge's inspired leadership and coup-management, with its gratifying outcome (Nov. 6).

<P>Two weeks before Kennedy's assassination, there is not a phrase in the voluminous internal record that even hints at withdrawal without victory. JFK urges that everyone "focus on winning the war"; withdrawal is conditioned on victory, and motivated by domestic discontent with Kennedy's war. The stakes are considered enormous. Nothing substantial changes as the mantle passes to LBJ.

<P>The post-coup situation had positive and negative aspects from the point of view of the President and his advisers. On the positive side, they hoped that the ruling generals would now at last focus on victory as the President had demanded, gain popular support, and end the irritating calls for US withdrawal and moves towards a peaceful settlement. On the other hand, there was disarray at all levels, while at home, advocacy of diplomacy was not stilled. Furthermore, evidence that undermined the optimistic assessments was becoming harder to ignore. The new government confirmed that the GVN "had been losing the war against the VC in the Delta for some time because it had been losing the population." A top-level meeting was planned for Honolulu on November 20 to consider the next steps. The US mission in Vietnam recommended that the withdrawal plans be maintained, the new government being "warmly disposed toward the U.S." and offering "opportunities to exploit that we never had before." Kennedy's plans to escalate the assault against the southern resistance could now be implemented, with a stable regime finally in place. McNamara, ever cautious, was concerned by a sharp increase in VC incidents and urged that "We must be prepared to devote enough resources to this job of winning the war."

<P>At the Honolulu meeting, a draft was written by McGeorge Bundy for what became NSAM 273, adopted after the assassination but prepared for JFK with the expectation that he would approve it in essentials, as was the norm. Top advisers agreed; Hilsman made only "minor changes." The State Department history states correctly that the draft "was almost identical to the final paper," differing only in paragraph 7.

<P>Both documents reiterate the basic wording of the early October documents. On withdrawal, the version approved by Johnson is identical with the draft prepared for Kennedy. It reads: "The objectives of the United States with respect to the withdrawal of U.S. military personnel remain as stated in the White House statement of October 2, 1963," referring to the statement of US policy formalized without essential change as NSAM 263. As for paragraph 7, the draft and final version are, respectively, as follows:

<P><CITE>Draft</CITE>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>With respect to action against North Vietnam, there should be a detailed plan for the development of additional Government of Vietnam resources, especially for sea-going activity, and such planning should indicate the time and investment necessary to achieve a wholly new level of effectiveness in this field of action.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><CITE>NSAM 273</CITE>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Planning should include different levels of possible increased activity, and in each instance there should be estimates of such factors as: A. Resulting damage to North Vietnam; B. The plausibility of denial; C. Possible North Vietnamese retaliation; D. Other international reaction.

<P>Plans should be submitted promptly for approval by higher   authority.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>There is no relevant difference between the two documents, except that the LBJ version is weaker and more evasive, dropping the call for "a wholly new level of effectiveness in this field of action"; further actions are reduced to "possible." The reason why paragraph 7 refers to "additional" or "possible increased" activity we have already seen: such operations had been underway since the Kennedy offensive of 1962, apparently with direct participation of US personnel and foreign mercenaries.

<P>No direct US government involvement is proposed in NSAM 273 beyond what was already underway under JFK. The plans later developed by the DOD and CIA called for "Intensified sabotage operations in North Vietnam by Vietnamese personnel," with the US involved only in intelligence collection (U-2, electronics) and "psychological operations" (leaflet drops, "phantom covert operations," "black and white radio broadcasts").

<P>These two NSAMs (263 in October, 273 on Nov. 26 with a Nov. 20 draft written for Kennedy) are the centerpiece of the thesis that Kennedy planned to withdraw without victory, a decision at once reversed by LBJ (and perhaps the cause of the assassination). They have been the subject of many claims and charges. Typical is Oliver Stone's Address to the National Press Club alleging that a "ten-year study" by John Newman (<CITE>JFK and Vietnam</CITE>) "makes it very clear President Kennedy signaled his intention to withdraw from Vietnam in a variety of ways and put that intention firmly on the record with National Security Action Memorandum 263 in October of 1963," while LBJ "reverse[d] the NSAM" with NSAM 273; Kennedy was assassinated for that reason, Stone suggests. Zachary Sklar, the co-author (with Stone) of the screenplay <CITE>JFK,</CITE> also citing Newman's book, claims further that the draft prepared for Kennedy "says that the U.S. will <I>train South Vietnamese</I> to carry out covert military operations against North Vietnam" while "In the final document, signed by Johnson, it states that <I>U.S. forces</I> themselves will carry out these covert military operations," leading to the Tonkin Gulf incident, which "was an example of precisely that kind of covert operation carried out by U.S. forces" (his emphasis). Arthur Schlesinger claims that after the assassination, "President Johnson, listening to President Kennedy's more hawkish advisers..., issued National Security Action Memorandum 273 calling for the maintenance of American military programs in Vietnam `at levels as high' as before -- reversing the Kennedy withdrawal policy." As further proof he cites a paragraph from NSAM 273: "It <I>remains</I> the <I>central objective</I> of the United States in South Vietnam to <I>win</I> their contest against the <I>externally directed</I> and supported communist conspiracy." He highlights these words to show that LBJ was undertaking "both the total commitment Kennedy had always refused and the diagnosis of the conflict" that Kennedy had "never quite accepted."

<P>These alleged facts are held to establish the historic change at the assassination.

<P>The claims, however, have no known basis in fact, indeed are refuted by the internal record, which gives no hint of any intention by JFK to withdraw without victory -- quite the contrary -- and reveals no "reversal" in NSAM 273. Newman's book adds nothing relevant. The call for maintenance of aid is in the draft of NSAM 273 prepared for Kennedy, and was also at the core of his tentative withdrawal plans, conditioned on victory and "Major U.S. assistance" to assure it. Furthermore, Kennedy's more dovish advisers approved and continued to urge LBJ to follow what they understood to be JFK's policy, rejecting any thought of withdrawal without victory. The final version of NSAM 273 does not state that US forces would carry out covert operations in any new way; nor did they, in the following months. There were covert attacks on North Vietnamese installations just prior to the Tonkin Gulf incident, but they were carried out by South Vietnamese forces, according to the internal record. Schlesinger's highlighted words appear regularly in both the public and private Kennedy record, as does the diagnosis, along with JFK's insistent demand that everyone must "focus on winning the war." The hidden meanings are in the eye of the beholder.

<P>The two versions of NSAM 273 differ in no relevant way, apart from the weakening of paragraph 7 in the final version. Furthermore, the departure from NSAM 263 is slight, and readily explained in terms of changing assessments. Efforts to detect nuances and devious implications have no basis in fact, and if pursued, could easily be turned into a (meaningless) "proof" that LBJ toned down Kennedy aggressiveness.

<P>The call in NSAM 273 (both the draft and the weakened LBJ version) for consideration of further ARVN operations against the North is readily explained in terms of the two basic features of the post-coup situation: the feeling among Kennedy's war planners that with the Diem regime gone, the US at last had a stable base for Kennedy's war in the South, with new "opportunities to exploit"; and the increasing concern about the military situation in the South, undermining earlier optimism. The former factor made it possible to consider extension of ARVN operations; the latter made it more important to extend them. In subsequent months, Kennedy's planners (now directing Johnson's war) increasingly inclined towards operations against the North as a way to overcome their inability to win the war in the South, leading finally to the escalation of 1965, undertaken largely to "drive the DRV out of its reinforcing role and obtain its cooperation in bringing an end to the Viet Cong insurgency," using "its directive powers to make the Viet Cong desist" (Taylor, Nov. 27, 1964).  

<H3>LBJ and the Kennedy Doves</H3>

<P>Kennedy's more dovish advisers recommended the policies that Johnson pursued, and generally approved of them until the 1965 escalation, often beyond. They lost no time in making clear that JFK's commitment to victory would not be abandoned. On December 10, Forrestal, Ball, Harriman and Hilsman, reiterating JFK's consistent stand, assured Lodge that "we are against neutralism and want to win the war." The same unwavering commitment was reiterated by Ball, who informed Lodge on Dec. 16 that "Nothing is further from USG mind than `neutral solution for Vietnam.' We intend to win." A year later (Nov. 1964), Ball held that the Saigon regime must continue to receive US aid until the Viet Cong is defeated and that "the struggle would be a long one, even with the DRV out of it." Ball and other doves continued to support Johnson's policies, which they regarded as a continuation of Kennedy's. On May 31, 1964, Ball praised "the President's wise caution" and refusal to "act hastily."

<P>Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, later portrayed as an advocate of withdrawal, had raised only tactical objections to JFK's escalation. He advised JFK to abandon "rhetorical flourishes" about the great stakes (advice that the President rejected, as noted). And recognizing that Diem was not fighting the war effectively, he advised withdrawal of some advisors "as a symbolic gesture, to make clear that we mean business when we say that there are some circumstances in which this commitment will be discontinued." Mansfield generally supported Johnson's policies. At an NSC meeting on April 3, 1964, LBJ rejected Senator Morse's proposal for "using SEATO and the UN to achieve a peaceful settlement" in favor of McNamara's view that withdrawal or neutralization would lead to a Communist takeover and therefore remain unacceptable options. Mansfield agreed, urging "that the President's policy toward Vietnam was the only one we could follow." He firmly rejected the withdrawal option and the diplomatic moves counselled by Morse. In January 1965, Mansfield publicly supported "the President's desire neither to withdraw nor carry the war to North Vietnam" (<CITE>PP</CITE>). Later, he bitterly condemned critics of Johnson's escalation.

<P>Quite generally, Kennedy's most dovish advisers sensed no change at the transition and lent their support to Johnson. Some praised his "wise caution," while others called for more aggressive action. By mid-1964, Forrestal was coming to support escalation of actions against the North. Hilsman's position was similar. In a March 14 memorandum he stressed the need "to take whatever measures are necessary in Southeast Asia to protect those who oppose the Communists and to maintain our power and influence in the area," including "whatever military steps may be necessary to halt Communist aggression in the area" (crucially, VC "aggression"). We should station a Marine battalion in Saigon on the pretext of protecting American dependents. Attacks against the North might be "a useful <I>supplement</I> to an effective counterinsurgency program," but not "an effective <I>substitute</I>" for it. We must "continue the covert, or at least deniable, operations" against the North in order to keep "the threat of eventual destruction alive in Hanoi's mind."  Recall that he had made the same recommendations in April 1963, in virtually the same words, including the advice to "continue" the ongoing covert operations against the North with their implicit threat of destruction.

<P>The support for LBJ among the Kennedy doves comes as no surprise, given their familiarity with the internal record, which shows no deviation on the President's part from Harriman's judgment that "there are no quitters here." As the optimistic predictions of 1962-3 collapsed after the coup that overthrew Diem, undermining the precondition for withdrawal, they advocated a change of tactics to achieve the "fundamental objective" always sought.

<P>We might note, at this point, that the military leadership was divided over the war. General Douglas MacArthur and his successor as Army Chief of Staff, Matthew Ridgway, were strongly opposed to the use of combat troops. The top US military commander in Vietnam, MAAG Chief General Lionel McGarr, informed JFK on February 22, 1962 that "in providing the GVN the tools to do the job," the US "must not offer so much that they forget that the job of saving the country is theirs -- only they can do it." General Taylor and Pacific Commander Admiral Henry Felt shared these qualms about combat troops. As plans to overthrow the Diem-Nhu regime were underway in September 1963, Taylor expressed his "reluctance to contemplate the use of U.S. troops in combat in Vietnam," while agreeing with the President and his other top advisers that "our sole objective was to win the war." A year after the assassination, agreeing with McGarr, Taylor continued to urge that the US keep to the "principle that the Vietnamese fight their own war in SVN" (Nov. 3, 1964). He therefore opposed sending logistical forces for flood relief because that would require dispatch of "US combat troops in some numbers to provide close protection." Two weeks later, he informed President Johnson directly that he was now "quite certain [US combat troops] were not needed...as the estimates of the flood damage diminish." In September 1964, Taylor had explained that the military command "did not contemplate" committing combat forces because Commanding General Westmoreland, also echoing McGarr, felt that use of American troops "would be a mistake, that it is the Vietnamese' war."

<P>In later years, great import has been attributed to JFK's public reiteration of the McGarr-Westmoreland-Taylor "principle" in his Sept. 1963 statement that "In the final analysis it is their war.  They have to win it or lose it." It is, therefore, worth stressing that the "principle" was standard throughout in internal and public discussion, through 1964, including LBJ's public statements.

<P>General David Shoup, Marine Commandant through the Kennedy years, reports that when the Joint Chiefs considered troop deployment, "in every case...every senior officer that I knew...said we should never send ground combat forces into Southeast Asia." Shoup's public opposition to the war from 1966 was particularly strong, far beyond anything said by the civilian leadership, media doves, or others who later presented themselves as war critics.

<P>These observations add further weight to the conclusion based on the record of internal deliberations, in which JFK insists upon victory and considers withdrawal only on this condition. Had he intended to withdraw, he would have been able to enlist respected military commanders to back him, so it appears, including the most revered figures of the right. He made no effort to do so, preferring instead to whip up pro-war sentiment with inflammatory rhetoric about the awesome consequences of withdrawal.  

<H3>Interpretations: the Early Version</H3>

<P>The final source of evidence on JFK's plans is the memoirs and other comments of his advisers. These come in two versions: before and after the Tet offensive. We review these in the next two sections, then turning to the 1991-2 revival and revisions. This survey only adds conviction to what we have already found.

<P>Kennedy's commitment to stay the course was clear to those closest to him. As noted, Arthur Schlesinger shared JFK's perception of the enormous stakes and his optimism that the military escalation had reversed the "aggression" of the indigenous guerrillas in 1962. There is not a word in Schlesinger's chronicle of the Kennedy years (1965, reprinted 1967) that hints of any intention to withdraw without victory. In fact, Schlesinger gives no indication that JFK thought about withdrawal at all. The withdrawal plans receive one sentence in his voluminous text, attributed to McNamara in the context of the debate over pressuring the Diem regime. There is nothing else in this 940-page virtual day-by-day record of the Kennedy Administration by its quasi-official historian. Far more detail had appeared in the press in October-December 1963.

<P>These facts leave only three possible conclusions: (1) the historian was keeping the President's intentions secret; (2) this close JFK confidant had no inkling of his intentions; (3) there were no such intentions.

<P>By 1966, it was becoming clear that things were not going well in Vietnam. In his <CITE>Bitter Heritage</CITE> (1966), Arthur Schlesinger expressed concern that the US military effort had dubious prospects, though "we may all be saluting the wisdom and statesmanship of the American government" if it succeeds. Referring to Joseph Alsop's predictions of victory, Schlesinger writes that "we all pray that Mr. Alsop will be right," though he doubts it. The only qualms are tactical: what will be the cost to us? Schlesinger describes himself as holding high the spirit of JFK. He flatly opposes withdrawal, which "would have ominous reverberations throughout Asia," and again gives no hint that Kennedy ever considered such a possibility.

<P>Another close associate, Theodore Sorenson, also published a history of the Administration in 1965. Sorenson was Kennedy's first appointed official, served as his special counsel and attended all NSC meetings. He makes no mention of withdrawal plans. Quite the contrary. Kennedy's "essential contribution," he writes, was to avoid the extremes advocated "by those impatient to win or withdraw. His strategy essentially was to avoid escalation, retreat or a choice limited to these two, while seeking to buy time...." He opposed withdrawal or "bargain[ing] away Vietnam's security at the conference table." Sorenson's conclusion is that JFK "was simply going to weather it out, a nasty, untidy mess to which there was no other acceptable solution. Talk of abandoning so unstable an ally and so costly a commitment `only makes it easy for the Communists,' said the President. `I think we should stay'." So his account ends.  Again, we may choose among the same three conclusions.

<P>No one was closer to JFK than his brother Robert. He had expressed his position in 1962: "The solution lies in our winning it. This is what the President intends to do.... We will remain here [in Saigon] until we do." In 1964 oral history, RFK said that the Administration had never faced the possibilities of either withdrawal or escalation. Asked what JFK would have done if the South Vietnamese appeared doomed, he said: "We'd face that when we came to it." "Robert's own understanding of his brother's position," his biographer Arthur Schlesinger reports, was that "we should win the war" because of the domino effect. The problem with Diem, RFK added, was that we need "somebody that can win the war," and he wasn't the man for it. Accordingly, it is no surprise that RFK fully supported Johnson's continuation of what he understood to be his brother's policies through the 1965 escalation.

<P>The last of the early accounts of the Kennedy Administration was written by Roger Hilsman in late 1967, shortly before the Tet offensive and well after severe doubts about the war were raised at the highest levels. He takes it for granted that the goal throughout was "to defeat the Communist guerrillas." He writes that had JFK lived, "he might well have introduced United States ground forces into South Vietnam -- though I believe he would not have ordered them to take over the war effort from the Vietnamese but would have limited their mission to the task of occupying ports, airfields, and military bases to demonstrate to the North Vietnamese that <I>they</I> could not win the struggle by escalation either" -- the enclave strategy that had been advocated by Ball and Taylor in early 1965, then by others. The question of how to respond to a collapse of the Saigon regime was delayed, he writes, in the hope that it would not arise. Hilsman feels that LBJ "sincerely even desperately wanted to make the existing policy work," without US combat forces, citing his statement of Sept. 25, 1964 that "We don't want our American boys to do the fighting for Asian boys." He cites the White House statement announcing the adoption of the McNamara-Taylor October 1963 recommendations, adding nothing of substance to what was published in the press at the time. His only comment is that the optimistic predictions on which withdrawal was predicated would come "to haunt Secretary McNamara and the whole history of American involvement in Vietnam."

<P>The internal record of 1964 shows that Kennedy doves saw matters much as described in the 1964-67 memoirs, and therefore continued to support Johnson's policies, some pressing for further escalation, others (Ball, Mansfield) praising Johnson for choosing the middle course between escalation and withdrawal.

<P>We have now reviewed all the crucial evidence: the events themselves, the public statements, the record of internal deliberations and planning, the opinions of the military, the attitudes of the Kennedy doves, and the pre-Tet memoirs and commentary. The conclusions are unambiguous, surprisingly so on a matter of current history: President Kennedy was firmly committed to the policy of victory that he inherited and transmitted to his successor, and to the doctrinal framework that assigned enormous significance to that outcome; he had no plan or intention to withdraw without victory; he had apparently given little thought to the matter altogether, and it was regarded as of marginal interest by those closest to him. Furthermore, the basic facts were prominently published at the time, with more detail than is provided by the early memoirs.  

<H3>The Record Revised</H3>

<P>After the Tet Offensive, major domestic power sectors concluded that the enterprise was becoming too costly to them and called for it to be terminated. President Johnson was, in effect, dismissed from office, and policy was set towards disengagement. The effect on the ideological system was dramatic. The liberal intelligentsia felt the "need to insulate JFK from the disastrous consequences of the American venture in Southeast Asia," Thomas Brown observes in his study of Camelot imagery. "Kennedy's role in the Vietnam war is unsurprisingly...the aspect [of his public image and record] that has been subjected to the greatest number of revisions by Kennedy's admirers.... The important thing was that JFK be absolved of responsibility for the Vietnam debacle; when the need for exculpation is so urgent, no obstacles -- including morality and the truth -- should stand in the way" (<CITE>JFK: History of an Image,</CITE> 1988).

<P>The latter comment relates specifically to one of the earliest post-Tet efforts to revise the image, the 1972 memoir by White House aide Kenneth O'Donnell, whose stories have assumed center stage in the post-Tet reconstruction. He writes that Kennedy had informed Senator Mansfield that he agreed with him "on the need for a complete military withdrawal from Vietnam," adding that he had to delay announcement of "a withdrawal of American military personnel" until after the November 1964 election to avoid "another Joe McCarthy scare." In 1975, Mansfield told columnist Jack Anderson that Kennedy "was going to order a gradual withdrawal" but "never had the chance to put the plan into effect," though he had "definitely and unequivocally" made that decision; in 1978, Mansfield said further that Kennedy had informed him that troop withdrawal would begin in January 1964 (which does not fit smoothly with the O'Donnell story).

<P>Noting Mansfield's (partial) confirmation of O'Donnell's report, Brown points out that "one need not reject this story out of hand...to doubt that it was a firm statement of Kennedy's intentions in Vietnam. Like many politicians, JFK was inclined to tell people what they wanted to hear." Every authentic historian discounts such reports for the same reason: "Kennedy probably told [Mansfield] what he wanted to hear," Thomas Paterson observes. The same holds for other recollections, authentic or not, by political figures and journalists.

<P>Whatever else he may have been, Kennedy was a political animal, and knew enough to tell the Senate Majority Leader and other influential people what they wanted to hear. He was also keenly sensitive to the opposition to his policies among powerful Senators, who saw them as harmful to US interests. He also was aware that public support for the war was thin, as was McNamara and others. But JFK never saw the general discontent among the public, press, and Congress as an opportunity to construct a popular base for withdrawal; rather, he sought to counter it with extremist rhetoric about the grand stakes. He hoped to bring the war to a successful end before discontent interfered with this plan. Had he intended to withdraw, he would also have leaped at the opportunity provided by the GVN call for reduction of forces (even outright withdrawal), and its moves toward political settlement. As for the right-wing, a President intent on withdrawal would have called upon the most highly-respected military figures for support, as already noted. There is no indication that this reasonable course was ever considered, again confirming that withdrawal was never an option.

<P>The O'Donnell-Mansfield story is hardly credible on other grounds. Nothing would have been better calculated to fan right-wing hysteria than inflammatory rhetoric about the cosmic issues at stake, public commitment to stay the course, election on the solemn promise to stand firm come what may, and then withdrawal and betrayal. Furthermore, Mansfield's actual positions differed from the retrospective version, as noted. Far more credible, if one takes such reconstructions seriously, is General Wheeler's recollection in 1964 (not years later) that Kennedy was interested in extending the war to North Vietnam.

<P>Despite such obvious flaws as these, the O'Donnell-Mansfield stories are taken very seriously by Kennedy hagiographers.

<P>The Camelot memoirists proceeded to revise their earlier versions after Tet, separating JFK (and by implication, themselves) from what had happened. Sorenson was the first. In the earlier version, Kennedy was preparing for the introduction of combat troops if necessary and intended to "weather it out" come what may, not abandoning his ally, who would have collapsed without large-scale US intervention. Withdrawal is not discussed. Diplomacy is considered a threat, successfully overcome by the overthrow of the Diem government. But post-Tet, Sorenson is "convinced" that JFK would have sought diplomatic alternatives in 1965 -- with the client regime in still worse straits, as he notes. The October 1963 withdrawal plan, unmentioned in the old version, assumes great significance in the post-Tet revision, with significant omissions: notably, the precondition of military success.

<P>Arthur Schlesinger entered the lists in 1978 with his biography of Robert Kennedy. Unlike Sorenson, he does not confine himself to speculation about JFK's intent. Rather, he constructs a new history, radically revising his earlier account. Thus, while the pre-Tet versions gave no hint of any intent to withdraw without victory, in the post-Tet biography of Robert Kennedy, JFK's alleged withdrawal plans merit a full chapter, though RFK's "involvement in Vietnam had been strictly limited before Dallas," Schlesinger observes. This startling difference between the pre- and Post-Tet versions is not attributed to any significant new information, indeed is not mentioned at all. In 1992, in a review of Newman's book, Schlesinger went a step further, claiming that he had put forth the JFK withdrawal thesis all along.

<P>Post-Tet, the October 1963 decisions, emerging from their earlier obscurity, become "the first application of Kennedy's phased withdrawal plan." Unmentioned before, this plan now serves as prime evidence that Kennedy had separated himself from the two main "schools": the advocates of counterinsurgency and of military victory. The plan shows that JFK was opposed to "both win-the-war factions, ...vaguely searching for a nonmilitary solution." His public call for winning the war is apparently to be understood as a ploy to deflect the right-wing.

<P>Pre-Tet, it was JFK and Arthur Schlesinger who rejoiced over the defeat of "aggression" in Vietnam in 1962. Post-Tet, it is the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> that absurdly denounces "Communist `aggression' in Vietnam," while "Kennedy was determined to stall." And though RFK did call for victory over the aggressors in 1962, he was deluded by "the party line as imparted to him by McNamara and Taylor," failing to understand the huge gap between the President's views and the McNamara-Taylor party line -- which Schlesinger had attributed to the President, with his own endorsement, in the pre-Tet version. In the post-Tet version, the Joint Chiefs join the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> McNamara, and Taylor as extremists undermining the President's moderate policies. Commenting on JCS Chairman General Lyman Lemnitzer's invocation of the "well-known commitment to take a forthright stand against Communism in Southeast Asia," Schlesinger writes sardonically that it may have been "well-known" to the Chiefs, but they "failed in their effort to force it on the President" -- who regularly voiced it in still more strident terms, including several cases that Schlesinger had cited, pre-Tet: e.g., JFK's fears of upsetting "the whole world balance" if the US were to retreat in Vietnam. Or, we may add his summer 1963 statement that "for us to withdraw from that effort [to secure the GVN] would mean a collapse not only of South Vietnam but Southeast Asia," which Schlesinger quoted and praised as "temperate," pre-Tet (902-3).

<P>This book and later Schlesinger efforts are so replete with misrepresentation and error as to defy brief comment. I will return to them elsewhere. They illustrate the seriousness of the post-Tet endeavor, and its dim prospects.

<P>The third early Kennedy memoirist, Roger Hilsman, has written letters to the press responding to critics of the withdrawal thesis in which he takes a stronger stand on JFK's intent to withdraw than in his highly qualified 1967 comments. His factual references are misleading, but a close reading shows that Hilsman is careful to evade the crucial questions: in particular, the precondition of victory. He cites Kennedy's statement that "it is their war" to win or lose as proof of his plan to withdraw, claiming without evidence that Johnson at once reversed that intent. He had said nothing of the sort pre-Tet; quite the contrary, as we have seen (including the internal record). Furthermore, if JFK's statement demonstrates his intent to withdraw, we would have to draw the same conclusions about McGarr, Taylor, Westmoreland, and LBJ. That, of course, is precisely why Hilsman makes no such claim in his 1967 memoir, in which he emphasizes LBJ's statement that "We don't want our American boys to do the fighting for Asian boys" to show his "sincere" and "desperate" effort to carry out JFK's plans. The same holds of efforts by Schlesinger and others to read great significance into JFK statements that were conventional and mean little.

<P>However informative they may be with regard to the duties and responsibilities of cultural management, the post-Tet revisions by leading Kennedy intellectuals have no value as history. Rather, they <I>constitute</I> a chapter of cultural history, one that is of no slight interest, I believe.  

<H3>The Hero-Villain Scenario</H3>

<P>The withdrawal-without-victory thesis is typically understood to subsume a second one: that LBJ was responsible for an immediate reversal of policy from withdrawal to escalation. The major effort to establish the dual thesis is Newman's book, which has received much attention and praise over a broad spectrum. It was the basis for the influential Oliver Stone film <CITE>JFK,</CITE> and is taken by much of the left to be a definitive demonstration of the twin theses. The book was strongly endorsed by Arthur Schlesinger, who describes it as a "solid contribution," with its "straightforward and workmanlike, rather military...organization, tone and style" and "meticulous and exhaustive examination of documents." Former CIA Director William Colby, who headed the Far East division of the CIA in 1963-64, hailed Newman's study of these years as a "brilliant, meticulously researched and fascinating account of the decision-making which led to America's long agony in Vietnam"; <I>America's</I> agony, in accordance with approved doctrine.

<P>The book is not without interest. It contains some new documentary evidence, which further undermines the Newman-Schlesinger thesis when extricated from the chaotic jumble of materials interlarded with highlighted phrases that demonstrate nothing, confident interpretations of private intentions and beliefs, tales of intrigue and deception of extraordinary scale and complexity, so well-concealed as to leave no trace in the record, and conclusions that become more strident as the case collapses before the author's eyes. By the end, he claims that the National Security Council meetings of <I>1961</I> "more than resolve the question" of whether Kennedy would have sent combat troops under the radically different circumstances faced by his advisers in 1965, a conclusion that captures accurately the level of argument.

<P>Newman's basic contention seems to be that JFK was surrounded by evil advisers who were trying to thwart his secret plan to withdraw without victory, though unaccountably, he kept giving them more authority and promoting them to higher positions, perhaps because he didn't understand them. Thus JFK thought that Taylor was "the one general who shared his own views and that he could, therefore, trust to carry out his bidding." Shamelessly deceived, JFK therefore promoted him to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and relied on him until the end, though Taylor was undermining him at every turn; Taylor became "the second most powerful person in the White House," Newman observes (180), with no attempt to resolve the paradox. There are a few "good guys," but in the chaos, it is hard to be sure who they are: perhaps Harriman, Forrestal, Hilsman, and McNamara, though even they joined the malefactors who beset our hero on every side (Harriman and Hilsman "mired Kennedy in a plot to overthrow Diem," etc.).

<P>The withdrawal-without-victory thesis rests on the assumption that Kennedy realized that the optimistic military reports were incorrect. Newman agrees that through 1962 JFK accepted the optimistic reports, but asserts that by March 1963, he had "figured out...that the success story was a deception." There is "hard evidence" for this, he claims, referring to an NBC documentary on the Diem assassination in November 1963 that questioned the optimistic intelligence reports. The remainder of the evidence is that "in his heart he must have known" that the military program was a failure. Unlike his advisers (at least, those not in on the various "deceptions"), he "had to notice when the military myth was shaken by Bowles and Mendenhall in late 1962," and by Mansfield's pessimism. "When the drama of the Wheeler versus Hilsman-Forrestal match ended up in his office in February 1963, the implication that the story of success was untrue could no longer be overlooked" (by Kennedy, uniquely); the "drama" is the difference of judgment as to the time scale for victory, already reviewed.

<P>Not a trace of supporting evidence appears in the internal record, or is suggested here. Furthermore, the reports by Bowles and Mendenhall date from <I>before</I> the time when JFK was still deceived, according to Newman's account, and Mendenhall's at least never even reached him, he notes. As for Bowles, who had been cut out of policymaking sectors much earlier, Newman does not mention that after visiting Vietnam in July 1963, he sent a highly confidential report to McGeorge Bundy (which, in this case, the President may have seen), in which he wrote that "the military situation is steadily improving" although "the political situation is rapidly deteriorating," repeating the standard view of military success, political failure, recommending various escalatory steps, and expressing his hope that with "a bit of luck," we may "turn the tide" and "lay the basis for a far more favorable situation in Southeast Asia."

<P>On this basis, we are to believe that JFK alone understood that official optimism was unwarranted.

<P>Curiously, there is one bit of evidence that does support the conclusion, but Newman and other advocates of the thesis do not make use of it. Recall that at the NSC meeting considering the McNamara-Taylor recommendations that were partially endorsed in NSAM 263, Kennedy insisted on dissociating himself even from the plan to withdraw 1000 personnel because he did not want to be "accused of being over optimistic" in case the military situation did not make it feasible. He allowed the sentence on withdrawal to remain only if attributed to McNamara and Taylor, without his acquiescence. In public too he was more hesitant about the withdrawal plan than the military command. One might argue, then, that JFK did not share the optimism of his advisers, and was therefore unwilling to commit himself to withdrawal. This conclusion has two merits not shared by the thesis we are examining: (1) it has some evidence to support it; (2) it conforms to the general picture of Kennedy's commitment to military victory provided by the internal record.

<P>Newman's efforts to demonstrate the "far-reaching and profound nature of this reversal" that changed the course of history when the iniquitous LBJ took over are no more impressive. Thus he cites an alleged comment reported by Stanley Karnow, in which LBJ privately told the Joint Chiefs: "Just get me elected and then you can have your war." Putting aside the reliability of the source (which, elsewhere, Newman dismisses as unreliable when Karnow questioned the withdrawal thesis), the full context reveals that Karnow attributes to Johnson very much what O'Donnell attributes to Kennedy; assuage the right, get elected, and then do what you choose. What LBJ chose was to drag his feet much as JFK had done.

<P>Newman concedes that as of October 2, 1963, when the McNamara-Taylor withdrawal recommendations were presented, "So far, it had been couched in terms of battlefield success." But there was a "sudden turnabout of reporting in early November." "As the Honolulu meeting approached the tide turned toward pessimism as suddenly and as swiftly as the optimistic interlude had begun in early 1962," Newman writes. The participants in the Nov. 20 meeting received "shocking military news." "The upshot of the Honolulu meeting," he continues, "was that the shocking deterioration of the war effort was presented in detail to those assembled, along with a plan to widen the war, while the 1,000-man withdrawal was turned into a meaningless paper drill." The three components of the "upshot" are of course related. The fact that prior to the "sudden turn toward pessimism" the entire discussion of withdrawal had been "couched in terms of battlefield success" thoroughly undermines Newman's thesis, as becomes only more clear if we introduce the internal record that he ignores.

<P>In the end, Newman relies almost exclusively on the virtually meaningless O'Donnell-Mansfield post-Tet reconstructions, while ignoring the internal record, briefly reviewed, which conforms closely to JFK's public stance. His tale is woven from dark hints and "intrigue," with "webs of deception" at every level.  The military were deceiving Kennedy's associates who were deceiving Kennedy, while he in turn was deceiving the public and his advisers, and many were deceiving themselves. At least, I think that is what the story is supposed to be; it is not easy to tell in this labyrinth of fancy. We are invited to view the "unforgettable image of a President pitted against his own advisers and the bureaucracy that served under him" from the very outset, without a hint of evidence and no explanation as to why he chose to rely on them in preference to others. Newman concedes that JFK's public statements refute his thesis, but that's easily handled: JFK was cleverly feinting to delude the right-wing by preaching about the high stakes to the general public -- who largely didn't care or were uneasy about the war, as JFK and his advisers knew, and could only be aroused to oppose withdrawal by this inflammatory rhetoric.

<P>By the end, we are wandering along paths "shrouded in mystery and intrigue," guided by confident assertions about what various participants "knew," "pretended," "felt," "intended," etc. The facts, whatever they may be, are interpreted so as to conform to the central dogma, taken to have been established. Given the rules of the game (deceit, hidden intent, etc.), there can be no counter-argument: evidence refuting the thesis merely shows the depths of the mystery and intrigue. I will put aside further discussion here, returning to a fuller examination elsewhere.

<P>Whatever genre this may be, any pretense of unearthing the facts has been left far behind. As in the case of the post-Tet memoirs, the Newman study and its reception are of considerable interest, but not as a contribution to history: rather, as an interesting chapter of cultural history in the late 20th century.

<P>On October 30, the US-brokered conference on the Middle East opened in Madrid. The conference was described on all sides as a "historic event," a remarkable achievement of George Bush's diplomacy and the tenacity of his Secretary of State James Baker in exploiting the "historic window of opportunity" opened by changes in the world order. These observations are not unrealistic, when understood within their historical and policy context -- a question of perspective and judgment, of course. I will review the way these matters look to me, contrasting that picture with a different one that dominates public discussion.

<P>Three related questions arise at once about the current diplomatic efforts: First, why are they taking place right now? Second, do they signify a departure from the traditional US stand? Third, what is the meaning of the disputes between the US and Israel?

<P>The answer to the first question is clear enough. The Bush administration desperately needs a foreign policy success to obscure the outcome of its war in the Gulf: hundreds of thousands killed and the toll mounting as a long-term consequence of the devastating attack on the civilian society; the Gulf tyrannies safeguarded from any democratic pressures; Saddam Hussein firmly in power, having demolished popular rebellions with tacit US support. US government interests and goals are hardly concealed. Washington seeks "the best of all worlds," <CITE>New York Times</CITE> chief diplomatic correspondent Thomas Friedman explains: "an iron-fisted Iraqi junta without Saddam Hussein," a return to the days when Saddam's "iron fist held Iraq together, much to the satisfaction of the American allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia," along with the Reagan-Bush administrations, which gave unwavering support to their murderous ally. These images, however, cannot be left in the public memory in the United States or elsewhere.  The reality can be effaced by what the press describes as the "remarkable tableau" in Madrid, with its promise of a "sweet victory" built on the ruins of the Gulf slaughter.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Furthermore, the Arab clients who lined up in the US war must be helped to maintain some credibility. This requires gestures to suggest that the US-led crusade aimed at something more than merely reinforcing US dominance over the oil-producing regions, with the family dictatorships of the Gulf playing their traditional role as an "Arab Facade," in the words of British imperialists of earlier days.

<P>It is also necessary to divert the attention of the American public from the social and economic crisis resulting from Reagan-Bush domestic programs. Under such conditions, any powerful state would seek diversionary foreign policy exploits.

<P>The second question is also readily answered: the available evidence reveals no departure from the traditional US stance on a Middle East settlement. In fact, another reason for the current diplomatic efforts is that the US monopoly of violence now offers a "historic window of opportunity" to advance traditional US goals.

<P>The urgency of the current Bush-Baker diplomacy is understandable. Not surprisingly, Washington refused to permit the Madrid conference to be derailed by the intransigence of Israeli hawks, even at the cost of a confrontation with the government of Israel and its domestic lobby.

<P>That brings us to the third question, the Bush-Shamir conflict. Though real, it is narrowly circumscribed. There is no fundamental disagreement about the denial of Palestinian rights or US support for measures to extend Israeli control over the territories, just as both governments agree that Soviet Jews should be denied freedom of choice and directed to Israel, with the US paying the bill on humanitarian pretexts. Not an eyebrow is raised when the Jewish Agency meets in Jerusalem to demand that Jewish organizations "unite to sabotage" any efforts to open US doors to Soviet Jews, while in the Israeli press, Minister of Immigration and Absorption Michael Kleiner explains how he will induce Germany to reverse its decision to admit Soviet Jews but no other refugees: "Germany has already fulfilled its quota for discrimination concerning Jews in this century," Kleiner will inform these German criminals, "and the time has come for it to treat Jews just like other people" -- denying entry to Jewish refugees, so that they can be forced to Israel.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></FONT></SUP> The cynicism of the enterprise will surprise only those unfamiliar with the vastly more shameful practices of the 1940s, well into the post-Holocaust years when the miserable remnants of the extermination camps were treated in much the same way.

<P>The Bush-Shamir conflict arose over the timing of US guarantees for loans -- which may eventually turn into grants -- for the theoretical purpose of absorbing Soviet immigrants, though in fact they will be used to expand settlement in the occupied territories, whatever formalism is adopted. Huge sums are being "spilled like water" into the territories by the Israeli government for "ordinary and deluxe settlements," including elegant subsidized villas for privileged settlers, the Israeli press reports, diverting the funds that Israel has available to absorb Soviet immigrants (thanks to US largesse). And while "Jewish immigration from the USSR may be a great accomplishment in Zionist or Jewish terms, there is nothing humanitarian about it.... The humanitarianism is one of the lies the two states have agreed upon," in full knowledge that "the Jews of the USSR are now better off than any other ethnic group in that country," protected by foreign powers, able to leave if they wish, permitted to obtain foreign currency from abroad, and so on -- surely far better off than the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and others fleeing torture and harsh repression in Kuwait, most of them crowding into impoverished Jordan, or numerous other examples that readily come to mind. Israel's 1992 budget calls for up to $2 billion for expanding settlement in the territories, an amount "equivalent to one year's installment of the loan guarantees that Israel wants from the United States," the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> reports, hence an amount that Israel can take from other sources if these funds are assured by US "humanitarian" assistance.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>An official US decision to provide financial support for these projects would have made it very difficult for the US Arab allies to attend the Madrid conference; a few months down the road, it is assumed, the matter can be handled without too much fanfare. Ariel Sharon and other Israeli extremists were unwilling to accept even a temporary delay in their ambitious settlement project, and were also intent on undermining the US-run negotiations, which might interfere with their annexationist plans. That is one reason why "official Israel was dead silent" about the August coup attempt in the Soviet Union, while "some influential Israelis found it advisable to extend to the conspirators their joyous greetings and good advice," possibly including Shamir's expert advisers, the Israeli press reported, noting that a successful coup in the USSR might have undermined the unwanted Madrid conference.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></FONT></SUP> After the Soviet coup, the US propaganda system produced the required gestures of outrage about the alleged support for the coup or vacillation about it on the part of assorted official enemies, while keeping "dead silent" about unwanted realities, the usual pattern when atrocities and crimes afford an opportunity for service to power.

<P>The Bush-Shamir dispute goes beyond the timing of US financial support for Israeli settlement plans. There are real disagreements between Washington and the current Israeli government, serious and long-standing ones. But they concern the modalities of rejectionism, not its essence, a matter that merits a closer examination, to which we return.

<P>To clarify what follows, by the term "rejectionism" I mean the rejection of the right to national self-determination on the part of <I>one or the other</I> of the contending parties in the former Palestine. This is distinct from US usage, which restricts the term to those who reject the rights of Israeli Jews, denial of the right of self-determination of the indigenous inhabitants being considered proper and natural.

<P>The standard usage reflects the limits of US discussion, largely restricted to support for some version of Israeli rejectionism. At one extreme, we find those who suggest that Palestinians deserve nothing, like all of those who stand in the way of civilization. Others, like <CITE>Times</CITE> chief diplomatic correspondent and Middle East specialist Thomas Friedman, take a more forthcoming approach, because "only if you give the Palestinians something to lose is there a hope that they will agree to moderate their demands," abandoning the ludicrous hope for mutual recognition in a two-state settlement -- a "demand" that Friedman refused to report and consistently denied while producing the "balanced and informed coverage" for which he received the Pulitzer prize. "I believe that as soon as Ahmed has a seat in the bus, he will limit his demands," Friedman added, adopting the racist rhetoric used as a matter of course when dealing with the lower orders. He advised Israel to run the territories on the model of South Lebanon, controlled by Israeli troops and a terrorist surrogate army, with a hideous torture chamber in Khiam where hundreds are held hostage to ensure that the population will submit, Israeli administration of the flow and profits of heroin from the second largest drug production area in Lebanon (the most productive being the Bekaa valley, run by Bush's other friend, Hafez el-Assad of Syria), and regular bombardment beyond the borders to prevent resistance -- called "terrorism," a term that extends to attacks on drug cultivators protected by the Israeli army and its clients.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>At the time of the US-Israel confrontation, it took scarcely more than a raised eyebrow from the President for the Israeli lobby to collapse, while major journals that rarely veer from the Israeli Party line took the cue and began to run articles critical of Israeli practices and hinting that US support for them was not inevitable. That should also occasion little surprise. Domestic pressure groups tend to be ineffectual unless they line up with significant elements of state-corporate power, or have reached a scale and intensity that compels moves to accommodate them. When AIPAC lobbies for policies that the state executive and major sectors of corporate America intend to pursue, it is influential; when it confronts authentic power, largely unified, it fades very quickly.

<P>The essential issues just reviewed are more or less recognized within the doctrinal system, though they are presented more obliquely. It is no great secret that alleged "foreign policy triumphs," quickly removed from view to obscure what has actually taken place, can help to divert the public from domestic crises, along with racist and jingoist appeals, manufacture of awesome foreign and internal enemies, and other familiar devices of population control. The utility of the Madrid conference in obscuring Gulf realities is outlined by <CITE>New York Times</CITE> diplomatic correspondent R. W. Apple in the column already quoted, as the conference opened: "Critics have suggested that the United States achieved far too little in the war, because Saddam Hussein was not overthrown, Iran remained as hostile and Kuwait as undemocratic as ever, and Saudi Arabia shed neither its isolation nor its archaic ways." But the "remarkable tableau" in Madrid revealed "that a very great deal had changed," thanks to the "diplomatic skills" of James Baker and the Gulf triumph. Thus "George Bush and the United States today plucked the fruits of victory in the Persian Gulf war, but it is still much too early to predict how sweet they will be."

<P>To rephrase in more accurate terms, by limiting the options in the Gulf to violence, its strong card, Washington was able to determine the basic contours of what happened. It barred any challenge to the "iron fist" in the client states. It continues to torture the Iraqi people exactly as planned in the attack on the civilian infrastructure, which had no relation to the military conflict -- this was not a long war against Nazi Germany -- but did lay the basis for postwar US policies, including the current policy of holding the population hostage to induce some tolerable duplicate of Saddam Hussein to restore "the best of all worlds." Iraq aside, the US also intends to exploit the opportunity to teach valuable lessons to others who might have odd ideas about disobeying US orders, another standard policy; thus in mid-October, Washington once again blocked European and Japanese efforts to call off the embargo that the US imposed on Vietnam 16 years ago after direct conquest failed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></FONT></SUP> Those who do not follow the rules must be severely punished, indefinitely, and others must learn these lessons -- though the lessons must remain invisible to the American public, who are to be regaled with tales about the nobility of our aspirations and the grand achievements of our leaders.

<P>Crucially, the American public must not be allowed to perceive that the outcome in the Gulf reveals the priorities of the state that held all the cards, the state that could accurately proclaim that "What we say goes," in the President's words. The consequences of Washington's decisions must therefore be construed as a failure to achieve our noble goals, now to be compensated by Washington's diplomatic triumphs.


<H3>The US Versus the Peace Process</H3>

<P>Let us turn to the second question raised at the outset, and examine whether it is indeed correct to stress the continuity of US goals and policies.

<P>For many years, the US has stood virtually alone in opposition to international efforts to initiate a "peace process" on the Middle East. The UN record brings out the issues with considerable clarity. The Security Council was eliminated as a forum years ago, thanks to the US veto. At its annual winter meetings, the General Assembly regularly passes resolutions calling for a conference on the Arab-Israel crisis, most recently, in December 1990 (144-2, US and Israel in opposition). In December 1989, the vote was 151-3, Dominica joining the two rejectionist states; a year earlier, 138-2; and so on. US international isolation dates to February 1971 -- coincidentally, the very month when George Bush achieved national prominence as UN Ambassador. The US has also barred other initiatives. Given US power, its opposition amounts to a veto. Accordingly, there has been no international effort to deal with the conflict. The peace process has been effectively deterred.

<P>Again, the matter is described differently within the ideological system; in this case, just about universally, including scholarship. We read constantly that the Middle East is "littered with American peace plans" (editorial, <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE>),<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></FONT></SUP> and that US efforts have continually run aground because of the fanaticism and irrationality of Middle East extremists. Such descriptions are accurate, if we bear in mind the literary conventions: the term "peace process" is restricted to US government initiatives, including moves to bar attempts to achieve peace. It then follows as a matter of logic that the US is always advancing the peace process, and if internationally isolated, as in this case, it is alone in this endeavor. Efforts that the uninstructed might misconstrue as "the peace process" are really attempts to obstruct peace, that is, to interfere with US plans. It is really quite simple, once the norms of political correctness are understood.

<P>Departing from these norms, one should have no difficulty in understanding the traditional US opposition to the peace process. The UN resolutions call for an <I>international</I> conference, and the US brooks no interference in what President Eisenhower described as the most "strategically important area in the world," with its enormous energy reserves. This is US turf: no independent force is allowed, foreign or indigenous. As Henry Kissinger explained in a private communication, one of his major policy goals was "to ensure that the Europeans and Japanese did not get involved in the diplomacy" concerning the Middle East, a goal achieved at Camp David in 1978, and again in the current diplomacy -- that is, in the two cases that qualify as steps in the "peace process" in US rhetoric. Furthermore, UN and other initiatives endorse a Palestinian right of self-determination, which would entail Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. While there has been an elite policy split over the matter, the prevailing judgment for the past 20 years has been that enhancement of Israeli power contributes to US domination of the region. For these reasons, the US has always blocked attempts at diplomatic resolution, apart from its own rejectionist initiatives.

<P>It should be noted that the US opposition to diplomacy is not unusual. Southeast Asian and Central American conflicts provide examples familiar to those who have escaped the doctrinal system. The same has been true, quite often, of disarmament and many other issues, and US isolation at the UN extends far beyond the Middle East. These are natural concomitants of the role of global enforcer, committed to policies with little appeal to targeted populations but with ample force at the ready.

<P>The basic terms of the international consensus on the Arab-Israel conflict were expressed in a resolution brought to the Security Council in January 1976, calling for a settlement on the pre-June 1967 borders (the Green Line) with "appropriate arrangements...to guarantee...the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all states in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries," including Israel and a new Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The resolution was backed by Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and the PLO -- in fact "prepared" by the PLO according to Israel's UN Ambassador Haim Herzog, now President. It was strenuously opposed by Israel and vetoed by the United States, once again in 1980.

<P>These events are -- automatically -- out of history, along with other facts unacceptable to US power, including repeated PLO initiatives through the 1980s calling for negotiations with Israel leading to mutual recognition. The facts have been distorted beyond recognition, often barred outright, particularly by the <CITE>New York Times.</CITE> Its Pulitzer prize-winning correspondent Thomas Friedman has shown particular dedication to the task, an achievement appreciated by the journal, which promoted him to chief diplomatic correspondent in recognition of his accomplishments. It is an interesting case, because he knows enough to understand exactly what he is doing. This stellar performance permits Friedman to spin wondrous tales about "the birth of a new pragmatism among the Palestinians" from the late 1980s, now raised "another important notch" through Baker's benign influence at Madrid. Until Madrid, Friedman continues, "both sides have hidden behind [the] argument...that there is no one on the other side with whom to negotiate" -- Timesspeak for the fact that the PLO has for years been calling on Israel to negotiate, but the US and Israel refuse, claiming there is no one with whom to negotiate, while Friedman loyally reports as truths the US-Israel propaganda which he knows perfectly well to be pure fabrication. The Palestinians admitted by the US to the Madrid conference called "explicitly for a two-state solution," Friedman writes admiringly -- so different from the despised PLO, which supported (or perhaps "prepared") the UN resolution calling for a two-state solution 15 years ago.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The meaning of these shenanigans -- one of the more impressive achievements of modern propaganda -- is that the State Department and its spokesman believe that US-Israeli violence may at last have succeeded in bringing the Palestinians to heel. In the preferred rhetoric, the great achievement of Madrid was "the Palestinian self-adjustment to the real world," Palestinian acceptance of "a period of autonomy under continued Israeli domination," during which Israel can build the facts of its permanent domination with US aid. This willingness to follow US orders -- the real world -- has "tossed the negative stereotypes out the window," <CITE>Times</CITE> journalist Clyde Haberman observes approvingly. The "autonomy" offered at Madrid had been described two weeks earlier in <CITE>Ha'aretz</CITE> by Danny Rubinstein, one of the most acute observers of the occupied territories for many years: it is "autonomy as in a prisoner-of-war camp, where the prisoners autonomous' to cook their meals without interference and to organize cultural events."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The most outspoken critic of US Middle East policy, Anthony Lewis, offered a new proof of the brilliance of Bush-Baker diplomacy. Their "singular achievement" at Madrid "was quickly measured" by an election in Gaza in which moderates won a resounding victory over the fundamentalist extremists, sending "the message that Palestinians are ready to negotiate." This message is "of profound significance to Israelis," Lewis continues, telling the many doubters "that there are reasonable Palestinians, people ready to make peace, people not so different from themselves." In the past, "the ordinary Palestinians, with familiar aspirations for a decent life and a national identity, were drowned out by Palestinian terrorists," and "the Palestinian political leadership" was "reluctant to say plainly that it was ready to live in peace alongside of Israel." But now the dread PLO is no longer feared and the moderates can raise their heads, as shown by the Gaza elections in which the PLO won 13 of 16 seats contested.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The internal contradiction is easily resolved. We need only recall the real world, in which the PLO had been calling for negotiations and a peaceful settlement with Israel for many years, while the US and Israel never countered with any "reasonable people ready to make peace," just as they do not today, and Israel supported the fundamentalist extremists in its efforts to fend off the PLO moderation that it has always feared. But that solution is unacceptable. In a well-run ideological system, internal contradiction is far preferable to politically incorrect reality.

<P>Over the years, the US has continued to implement its rejectionist program without interference from meddling outsiders. The current circumstances afford an opportunity to carry the process further, with a diplomatic process run solely by the United States in accord with the principle that "What we say goes." Gorbachev's presence at Madrid was intended to provide a thin disguise for unilateral US control; in reality, he is acceptable as the powerless leader of a country that scarcely exists. The "peace process" is structured in accordance with US intentions. Palestinians are not permitted to select their own representatives, and those who pass US-Israel inspection are part of a Jordanian delegation. The US alone dictates the terms. I will turn to details and background directly, but the basic facts are surely clear enough.

<P>The standard picture is, again, rather different. Few have been so critical of US Middle East policy as <CITE>New York Times</CITE> correspondent Anthony Lewis, who lauds the President for having had "the vision and the courage to commit himself to this conference," in which "Israel will meet face-to-face with each of its Arab neighbors -- and with representative Palestinians" -- namely, those acceptable to the US and Israel, whatever Palestinians might prefer. Diplomatic correspondent R. W. Apple expands in a typical paean to our leader's "vision of the future" as he made use of "the historic window of opportunity." He identifies two factors that have made it possible for Bush "to dream such great dreams" about Israel-Arab peace: First, there is now no fear that "regional tensions" might lead to superpower confrontation; Second, "no longer must the United States contend with countries whose cantankerousness was reinforced by Moscow's interest in continuing unrest."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Both of Apple's points are correct, though translation is again required. The truth that lies behind his first point is that the withdrawal of the Soviet Union from the world scene has made it easier for the US to resort to force to gain its ends, a fact that has led to fear and desperation among the traditional victims throughout the Third World. One reason why the US insisted on war in the Gulf, deflecting the danger of a peaceful diplomatic settlement, was to demonstrate that it is now able to use extremes of violence against defenseless enemies without concern over the Soviet deterrent. As noted, the familiar lessons are again being taught in the postwar period.

<P>To interpret Apple's second point, we must recall that the "cantankerous" agents of Soviet disruption include the US European allies, the major Arab states, the nonaligned countries, in fact, essentially the world, apart from Israel. Apple's formulation reflects the standard doctrinal assumption that the US position on any issue is necessarily RIGHT, as a matter of logic, so those who stand in our way are "cantankerous," probably Comsymps to boot.

<P>There is an intriguing sidelight to the US-Israeli insistence that the political representatives of the Palestinians be excluded from negotiations. The official reason is that the PLO is a terrorist organization. Under Israeli law, anyone who has any dealings with it is subject to criminal penalties under the Law for the Prevention of Terror. The prime targets are Palestinians, but the law has also been used to punish Jews for contacts with the PLO, most recently, the courageous Abie Nathan, jailed once again.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></FONT></SUP> The background for the law was reviewed by one of Israel's leading legal commentators, Moshe Negbi, discussing a recent academic study of Lehi (the "Stern gang"), published on its 50th anniversary. Negbi's article is entitled "The Law to Prevent Meetings with the Head of State." As he explains, the Law for the Prevention of Terror was instituted on the initiative of Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion six days after the assassination of UN Ambassador Folke Bernadotte.  Ben-Gurion's goal was to break up Lehi, known at once to be responsible for the assassination. One of the three commanders of Lehi was Yitzhak Shamir. The law not only barred any contact with Shamir, but was also applied against Menahem Begin's terrorist Irgun Zvai Leumi (Etsel), impelling Begin to dismantle his Jerusalem organization. It was also used to jail religious extremists, including Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu, currently chief Rabbi. It was bitterly denounced as a "Nazi law, dictatorial, immoral" and hence illegal, by Menahem Begin and other civil libertarians. Despite efforts to have it modified under Labor governments, it remained in force, formally directed against Shamir and his Lehi associates, until 1977, when Begin was elected Prime Minister. Today the "Nazi law" still remains in force, but only to bar contacts with the PLO and to justify the US-Israeli refusal to permit Palestinians to select their own representatives for negotiations.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Those who think that Shamir might have renounced his past enthusiasm for terrorism -- which reached quite interesting levels -- might usefully turn to his comments on the occasion of the anniversary of Lehi on September 4, 1991: "We believed in what we said, discussed and wrote," he said: "Therefore, it was correct." "From the moral point of view, there is no difference between personal terror and collective terror. Here and there blood is spilled, here and there people are killed. One must look and judge it from the point of view of the utility of that means, the use of personal terror, in leading to the goal."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></FONT></SUP>


<H3>A US Policy Shift?</H3>

<P>Let us now turn to the standard assumption that Bush-Baker diplomacy represents a considerable departure from traditional US policies. One argument offered to explain this alleged fact is that the end of the Cold War reduces Israel's role as a "strategic asset." Anthony Lewis and other doves also argue that "the gulf war showed that U.S. armed forces could act in the Middle East without Israel." The upbeat analyses of the doves are also much influenced by the conflicts that have arisen between the Bush and Shamir governments, which are taken to show that "a more detached relationship is developing in which America will more freely weigh its own values and interests," not just follow the Israeli lead (Lewis).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></FONT></SUP> None of these arguments is very persuasive.

<P>The first rests on the general assumption that US policies towards the Third World have been motivated by concern over the Soviet threat. This is official doctrine for obvious propaganda reasons, but it is hardly sustainable, often the reverse of the truth, for reasons extensively documented elsewhere.. With regard to the Middle East, even before the Soviet pretext was lost serious analysts recognized that "radical nationalism" was the prime target of US intervention capacity (e.g., Robert Komer, the architect of President Carter's Rapid Deployment Force, in congressional testimony). By now it is conceded that the "threats to our interests" in that region "could not be laid at the Kremlin's door" (White House National Security Strategy report to Congress, March 1990).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></FONT></SUP> As for the lessons of the Gulf, surely no one ever doubted that the US could act without Israel, and in some circumstances would choose to do so. This has little bearing on Israel's perceived role as a strategic asset, particularly since the 1960s, when it was regarded by the US as a major barrier to Arab nationalist pressures against Saudi Arabia, led by Egypt's President Nasser.

<P>The third point is based on a correct observation: there are conflicts between Bush and Shamir. But as noted, there is no reason to believe that these are any different from the ones that have arisen for many years, reflecting different approaches to a rejectionist settlement. Failure to sort out these matters properly has led to much confusion about what is happening.

<P>Let us begin with the situation within Israel. There are two major political groupings, Likud and Labor, each a coalition. The position of Likud, now governing, has always been that Israel should extend its sovereignty over the occupied territories. Its central component, Prime Minister Shamir's Herut party, has never abandoned its claim to Jordan, regularly reiterated in its electoral programs. That was also the traditional position of a central component of the Labor coalition, based on the largest kibbutz movement, TAKAM (Ahdut Avodah, historically extremely expansionist), a position never officially abandoned, to my knowledge.

<P>The logic of the Likud position has recently been outlined by Defense Minister Moshe Arens, by no means an extremist. "In the final analysis," he said in a recent interview, "the existence of the State rests on the principle that we have a right to be here.  We are not here by kindness in a land that is foreign to us.... Any agreement, even conditional, that this right is limited -- touches on the essence of our existence here." Therefore, "the very existence of Israel depends on the settlements" in the occupied territories, and Israel's right to establish them at will.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></FONT></SUP> Scarcely concealed is the premise that the US taxpayer has the duty to pay the costs for Israel's "rights."

<P>In conformity with this reasoning, "Since Mr. Baker launched his postwar peace mission in early March [1991], Israel has confiscated more than 18,000 acres of Arab-owned land as part of its continuing effort to develop the territories for Jews," the <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> reports, and now has taken title to about 68% of West Bank land by various forms of legalistic chicanery.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></FONT></SUP> The <CITE>Journal</CITE> draws no conclusions about what this might imply concerning the nature and intent of "Mr. Baker's peace mission."  The operative assumption of objective journalism is that the US stands by, a helpless victim, pouring in funds for activities that it is unable to influence.

<P>The Labor coalition, which governed until 1977 and intermittently since, has preferred a different version of rejectionism. Its position, which has varied in details over the years, is based on the "Allon plan" adopted in 1968. It calls for Israel to take what it wants in the occupied territories: the resources, particularly West Bank water, on which Israel heavily relies; the usable land, including the area around a vastly expanded Jerusalem, now favored residential areas for the urban centers of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem; the Jordan valley; etc. Similarly, Israel must control the Golan Heights, in particular, its valuable water resources, now estimated to supply 25% of Israel's needs<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></FONT></SUP>; with regard to the Golan Heights, Labor is more hawkish than Likud. Earlier versions also called for Israeli control over Eastern and Northeastern Sinai. But Israel should not take responsibility for the Arab population concentrations, which are to remain stateless or administered by Jordan under effective Israeli control. The reason is "the demographic problem," the burden of dealing with too many Arabs in what is, by law, "the sovereign State of the Jewish people" in Israel and the diaspora, not the State of its citizens. A commitment to deprive too many citizens of rights carries costs that Labor considers too high.  The prevailing assumption has been that if only a minority, less than 20%, are second-class citizens by law, the costs will be tolerable, and Western commentators will be able to marvel over Israeli democracy. But problems increase if the numbers rise high enough to evoke images of South Africa.

<P>The US has tended to support the more rational Labor party form of rejectionism, a fact that brings it into occasional conflict with the government of Israel, as in the past few months. From the point of view of the Palestinians, there is little to choose between these two positions. Many Palestinians and Israeli doves regard the Likud version as potentially more hopeful; and in fact, Likud occupation policies have often been less harsh than those of the Labor party, contrary to the standard depiction of Labor doves versus Likud hawks.

<P>The US has also objected to the defiant and brazen settlement programs of Likud, preferring Labor's technique of quietly "building facts" that will determine the shape of the final outcome. In this connection, the disagreements are more about method than goal, as we see when we take a closer look at the actual policies and the thinking that lies behind them.

<P>The traditional Labor party doctrine was expressed by Prime Minister Golda Meir in addressing new Soviet immigrants in a meeting on the Golan Heights in September 1971: "the borders are determined by where Jews live, not where there is a line on a map." The guiding views were elaborated by her Minister of Defense, the influential planner Moshe Dayan, often considered something of a dove. He repeatedly emphasized that the settlements are "permanent," the basis for "permanent rule" by Israel over the territories: "the settlements are forever, and the future borders will include these settlements as part of Israel."

<P>The leading figure of the Labor party, David Ben-Gurion, held essentially the same view during the period of his political influence. Israeli journalist Amnon Kapeliouk observed 20 years ago that "every child in Israel knows one of the most famous expressions of the founder of the Jewish state, David Ben-Gurion: It is not important what the Gentiles say, what matters is what the Jews do'." Ben-Gurion's conception, clearly articulated in internal documents and sometimes in public, was that "a Jewish state...will serve as an important and decisive stage in the realization of Zionism," but only a <I>stage</I>: the borders of the state "will not be fixed for eternity," but will expand either by agreement with the Arabs "or by some other way," once "we have force at our disposal" in a Jewish State. His long-term vision included Jordan and beyond, sometimes even "the Land of Israel" from the Nile to the Euphrates.

<P>During the 1948 war, Ben-Gurion's view was that "To the Arabs of the Land of Israel only one function remains -- to run away." The words reflected traditional Zionist attitudes. Chaim Weizmann, the first President of Israel and the most revered Zionist figure, observed casually that the British had informed him that in Palestine "there are a few hundred thousand Negroes, but that is a matter of no significance." Weizmann had in turn informed Lord Balfour after World War I that "the issue known as the Arab problem in Palestine will be of merely local character and, in effect, anyone cognizant of the situation does not consider it a highly significant factor." Hence displacement of the Arabs and expansion of the Jewish settlement can be pursued with no moral qualms, merely tactical concerns.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The preferred image among cultivated US commentators is that Ben-Gurion was "a decisive man, steeped in classical culture, straightforward," "a man strong enough to compromise for the good of his people," in dramatic contrast to Yasser Arafat, who is "wily, certainly persistent and stubborn, gleefully adept at evasion" (much-respected <CITE>New York Times</CITE> columnist Flora Lewis).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></FONT></SUP> The reality, fully clear in the documentary record, is that Lewis's description of Arafat applies no less to Ben-Gurion. And of course, Lewis need not be concerned about Arafat's support for the 1976 UN resolution, his repeated calls for negotiations with Israel leading to mutual recognition through the 1980s, etc., all successfully effaced from history.

<P>The prevailing attitudes of the founders informed the internal policy planning of the 1967-77 Labor government. The matter is well worth understanding, because it is the Labor programs that the US government and more dovish elements in respectable US circles have tended to support. There is a revealing and well-documented review of cabinet discussions and decisions by Yossi Beilin, a high-level Labor party functionary close to Shimon Peres, now the official dove in US propaganda.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></FONT></SUP> Israel's first policy decision was on June 19, 1967, when a divided (11-10) cabinet proposed a settlement on the Green Line with Syria and Egypt (with Israel keeping Gaza), but no mention of Jordan and the West Bank. This proposal is described by Israeli diplomat Abba Eban in his retrospective account as "the most dramatic initiative that the government of Israel ever took before or since." Given the strong opposition to the proposal, it was kept secret, though it was secretly transmitted to Washington, to be passed on to Arab states.

<P>As noted, Moshe Dayan was a leading Labor party planner, and West Bank Arabs look back with some nostalgia to the days of his rule, because of his recognition of the justice of the Palestinian cause (which, however, must disappear into the ashcan of history, he held) and his belief that the authorities should keep out of the personal affairs of their Palestinian subjects. Dayan's first proposals, described by Beilin as "moderate," were presented to the cabinet on June 13, 1967. He proposed that Israel should annex the Gaza strip and "undertake negotiations with the Americans -- but only them -- about the transfer of Arabs [from the Gaza strip] to the West Bank" so that Israel would not have to absorb a million Arabs into the State. If Hussein agrees to accept "autonomy" for the West Bank, then Israel should allow him formally to take it over while Israel "rules to the Jordan river" in matters of security and foreign affairs, arrangements that would enable Israel to "build facts" quietly in the traditional fashion. As noted, the cabinet did not accept his views, keeping the West Bank and Jordan out of their secret proposal entirely.

<P>Along with Shimon Peres, Dayan was part of Rafi, the most hawkish sector of the Labor coalition apart from Ahdut Avodah (the main kibbutz movement). At a Rafi meeting of September 1967, there was a dispute between Peres and Dayan after Dayan explained more fully his position with regard to the Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories: "Let us approach them and say that we have no solution, that you shall continue to live like dogs, and whoever wants to can leave -- and we will see where this process leads." After they have lived "like dogs" under Israeli military occupation, Dayan continued, "It is possible that in five years we will have 200,000 less people -- and that is a matter of enormous importance." Peres objected to Dayan's advice that Israel become "like Rhodesia," arguing that these measures would harm Israel's international image and prospects for immigration.  For these tactical reasons, he argued, it is necessary to preserve Israel's "moral stand." Dayan's response was: "Ben-Gurion said that anyone who approaches the Zionist problem from a moral aspect, he is not a Zionist." He continued to advocate the Rhodesian solution.

<P>In the same September 1967 meeting, Rafi established its settlement policy, then implemented. It was written by Peres.  He observed that "Israel's new map will be determined by its policies of settlement and new land-taking," and therefore called for "urgent efforts" to establish settlements not only in East Jerusalem, but also "to the north, south and east," including Hebron, Gush-Etzion, etc.; the Jordan valley; "the central region of the mountains of Shechem [Nablus]"; the Golan Heights, the El-Arish region in the Sinai and the Red Sea access. The Labor coalition policies were even more extreme, notably the Galili protocols of 1973 and the policies implementing them, including the expulsion of thousands of Beduins into the desert, their homes, mosques and graveyards destroyed to clear the lands for the all-Jewish city of Yamit in northern Sinai, steps that led directly to the 1973 war.

<P>Much is made in US propaganda about Israel's eagerness to make peace after the 1967 war, if the Arabs could only bring themselves to make a simple telephone call. In a BBC interview on June 13, 1967, Dayan indeed said that Israel awaits a telephone call from the Arabs: "For our part, we will do nothing," he added. "We are quite happy with the current situation. If anything troubles the Arabs, they know where to find us."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></FONT></SUP> Hardly a passionate plea for peace, particularly when seen in context.

<P>A month before the Rafi meeting, in August 1967, Yigal Allon had advanced his "Allon plan," which became official policy a year later. Israel's position after cancellation of the secret 1967 proposal was presented to the UN by Abba Eban on September 8, 1968. Since then, the Labor coalition has adopted one or another version of the Allon plan. Its precise terms have never been clearly established, at least in the public record. But the basic content, sketched above, has been made reasonably clear along with occasional variations as circumstances change.

<P>No other Israeli initiatives are known. The general policy for which there is any documentation, to my knowledge, follows the guidelines expressed by President Haim Herzog in 1972: "I do not deny the Palestinians any place or stand or opinion on every matter. But certainly I am not prepared to consider them as partners in any respect in a land that has been consecrated in the hands of our nation for thousands of years. For the Jews of this land there cannot be any partner." Note that Herzog's attitudes are well within the mainstream of liberal Zionism, including Chaim Weizmann and others.

<P>Given the prevailing assumptions, it is not at all surprising that Dayan agreed with the policy of blocking all political activities on the West Bank, including pro-Jordanian activities. True, he was not as extreme as Prime Minister Golda Meir. Thus in 1972, Dayan at first was willing to permit a pro-Jordanian political conference in the West Bank, but he raised no objection when Meir ordered Minister of Police Shlomo Hillel to prevent it. Labor party policies are described by former Chief of Israeli intelligence Shlomo Gazit, a senior official of the military administration from 1967 to 1973. The basic principle, he observes, was "that it is necessary to prevent the inhabitants of the territories from participating in shaping the political future of the territory and they must not be seen as a partner for dealings with Israel"; hence "the absolute prohibition of any political organization, for it was clearly understood by everyone that if political activism and organization were permitted, its leaders would become potential participants in political affairs." The same considerations require "the destruction of all initiative and every effort on the part of the inhabitants of the territories to serve as a pipeline for negotiations, to be a channel to the Palestinian Arab leadership of the territories."  Israel's policy is a "success story," Gazit wrote in 1985, because these goals had been achieved, with continued US support and to much applause from left-liberal opinion in the United States.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Labor coalition began to speak of "territorial compromise only after the Yom Kippur war" of 1973, Beilin records, and expressed its willingness to consider "territorial compromise" in the West Bank "only at the end of February 1977," after "a severe dispute" internally. The terms "territorial compromise" and "land for peace" are used to refer to one or another version of the Allon plan, always rejecting entirely the Palestinian right to self-determination. The term "interim agreement" has a broader propaganda usage, incorporating either the Labor or the Likud form of rejectionism. These terms are blandly adopted by US commentators, either deceived by the rhetoric or engaged in deception themselves.

<P>As noted, the US has favored the Labor variety of rejectionism, more rational, and better attuned to the norms of Western hypocrisy. These more devious methods are easier to conceal than Likud expansionism, though the eventual outcome may not be greatly different. These are the primary issues that have separated the US and Israel from virtually the entire world. It is for that reason that the US has been compelled to block the peace process in the manner briefly reviewed.


<H3>Bush-Baker Diplomacy</H3>

<P>Until 1988, the US and Israel were more or less satisfied with the status quo, and were content merely to rebuff Arab and other efforts towards a peaceful diplomatic settlement while Israel extended its control over the territories. Problems arose, however, with the outbreak of the Intifada and the severe Israeli repression, which created negative images and other unwanted costs. Furthermore, PLO insistence on a political settlement, though not fundamentally different from earlier years, was becoming more difficult to suppress. The problem of diverting diplomacy was becoming serious by late 1988, when the US refused to permit Yasser Arafat to address the United Nations in New York, causing the UN to move its meeting to Geneva. By then, Secretary of State George Schultz and domestic commentators were becoming an international laughing stock with their increasingly desperate pretense that Arafat had failed to say the "magic words" dictated to him by Washington. The wise decision was made to resort to a familiar diplomatic trick, the "Trollope ploy": to pretend that Arafat had accepted US demands, welcome his invented capitulation, then impose upon him the US terms that Washington attributed to him. It was assumed correctly that the media and intellectual opinion would adopt Washington's claims without inspection, ignoring the fact -- transparent to any literate person -- that Arafat's positions remained as far from Washington's as before, and that no Palestinian spokesperson could possibly accept the US terms. The farce was played perfectly, and now has entered history, the facts being consigned to the memory hole in the usual manner of a well-run modern society.

<P>The PLO's reward for its invented capitulation was a low-level "dialogue" to divert world attention while Israel turned to harsher measures of repression to suppress the Intifada. Predictably, the PLO leadership played along, contributing to the success of the repression. The US-Israeli agreement was explained by Labor's Defense Secretary, Yitzhak Rabin, who informed Peace Now leaders in February 1989 that he welcomed the meaningless "dialogue," which would offer Israel a year or more to employ "harsh military and economic pressure." "In the end," Rabin explained, "they will be broken," and will accept Israel's terms. These plans were implemented, with much success.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT25" HREF="#FN25">25</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Meanwhile, Israel and the US initiated their own unilateral diplomatic track, to deflect the danger of an authentic peace process. A Likud-Labor coalition government proposed the so-called "Shamir Plan" in May 1989, more accurately the Shamir-Peres Plan.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT26" HREF="#FN26">26</A></FONT></SUP> The plan's "Basic Premises" are: (1) there can be no "additional Palestinian state in the Gaza district and in the area between Israel and Jordan"; (2) "Israel will not conduct negotiations with the PLO"; (3) "There will be no change in the status of Judea, Samaria and Gaza other than in accordance with the basic guidelines of the Government" of Israel, which reject Palestinian self-determination in any meaningful form. The phrase "additional Palestinian state" reflects the consensus view that there already is a Palestinian state, namely, Jordan, so that the issue of self-determination for the Palestinians does not arise, contrary to what Jordanians, Palestinians, and the rest of the world mistakenly believe. The "Basic Premises" incorporate the "Four No's" of the official Labor party program: No return to the 1967 borders, No removal of settlements, No negotiations with the PLO, No Palestinian state.  The coalition plan then calls for a peace treaty with Jordan and "free and democratic elections" under Israeli military occupation with the PLO excluded and much of the Palestinian leadership interned without charges in Israeli prison camps.

<P>The US quickly endorsed this forthcoming proposal. James Baker explained that "Our goal all along has been to try to assist in the implementation of the Shamir initiative. There is no other proposal or initiative that we are working with." On December 6, 1989, the Department of State released the Baker Plan, which spelled out five points for the "peace process," referring to an Egypt-Israel-Palestinian "dialogue" in Cairo. The Baker Plan stipulated that Israel would attend "only after a satisfactory list of Palestinians has been worked out," and that any Palestinians allowed by the US and Israel to attend would be restricted to discussion of implementation of the Shamir Plan.

<P>Recall that all of this was long before the Gulf War, and while the US-PLO "dialogue" was spinning along in its intentionally pointless way. Standard doctrine on the exclusion of the PLO is utterly without merit, as mere inspection of dates and documents clearly demonstrates -- for example, the claim that Arafat lost his place at the table "as a result of his support for Iraq in the gulf war" (Thomas Friedman), and that "the principal causes of the PLO's weakness" today are PLO support for Saddam Hussein and failure to expel the perpetrators of a thwarted terrorist action in May 1990, which led the US to suspend the dialogue, no longer of any tactical utility (editorial, <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE>).  Even if we adopt the version of what happened put forth by the propaganda system, it merely offers new pretexts for old policies, always supported by the same organs prior to the alleged crimes. The performance may be dismissed as childish, but given the guaranteed unanimity of voices, it is effective.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT27" HREF="#FN27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Gulf conflict did, however, accelerate the US pursuit of its rejectionist diplomacy, for reasons already discussed. That brings us to Madrid. Here too some historical background is useful to interpret what is happening, and to decode its portrayal.


<H3>The Evolution of US Policy</H3>

<P>The Madrid conference and its aftermath are concerned with the situation that arose in the wake of the June 1967 war, which left Israel in control of Egypt's Sinai peninsula, the Syrian Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip (administered by Egypt), and the West Bank (administered by Jordan, its status unrecognized internationally). Other issues are not under consideration. To mention only the most obvious, while the status of the West Bank is a topic of debate, Israel's incorporation of the other half of the Palestinian state proposed in the original UN partition resolution of 1947 is a settled issue. Jordan's illegitimate occupation of the West Bank figures prominently in US-Israeli propaganda; the fact that the Palestinian state was, in effect, partitioned between Jordan and Israel, with no small amount of collusion, and that Egypt fought in the 1948 war in part to counter the ambitions of Britain's Jordanian client, is left to scholarly monographs.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT28" HREF="#FN28">28</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Another settled issue is that the conference is based on UN resolution 242, adopted by the Security Council in November 1967. This resolution keeps to inter-state relations, avoiding the Palestinian issue, and is therefore acceptable to the US and Israel, as distinct from many other UN resolutions dating back to December 1948 that endorse Palestinian rights of varying sorts that the US does not acknowledge (though in some cases, the US voted for the resolutions). UN 242 is also acceptable because of its ambiguity. Crucially <I>not</I> settled is what the resolution means; it was left intentionally vague to assure at least formal acceptance by the states of the region.

<P>The resolution opens by "emphasizing the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every State in the area can live in security." It calls for "withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict," "termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries...."

<P>With regard to the meaning of these provisions, two crucial questions arise. First, what is the meaning of the phrase "from territories occupied"? Second, what is to be the status of the indigenous population of the former Palestine, the Palestinians, who are not a "State" and therefore do not fall under the resolution?

<P>Both questions reached the Security Council in January 1976, in the resolution discussed earlier, incorporating the basic wording of UN 242 but extending it to a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. The resolution answered the first question by calling for a settlement on the Green Line. It answered the second by calling for a Palestinian state in the territories from which Israel would withdraw. As noted, it was vetoed by the United States, effectively terminating any UN role in the peace process, apart from gestures. Given US opposition, all such proposals, however vague, are off the agenda, out of the historical record, not part of public discussion. The two basic questions concerning UN 242 therefore remain unresolved. To be more precise, they will be settled by force, that is, by the United States, in international isolation.  A different approach to the two questions left unsettled in UN 242 had been formulated by UN mediator Gunnar Jarring, who proposed a plan calling for a full peace treaty on the Green Line. This proposal was accepted by President Sadat of Egypt in February 1971. Israel recognized it as a genuine peace offer, but rejected it; the Labor party was committed to broader territorial gains from the 1967 war. Note that the Jarring-Sadat proposal offered nothing to the Palestinians. The basic problem is not Palestinian rights per se, but rather the fact that recognizing them would bar Israeli control over the occupied territories.

<P>At the insistence of National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, the US backed Israel's rejection of the Sadat offer, adopting Kissinger's policy of "stalemate." As usual, the US decision to back Israel's rejection of the Jarring-Sadat peace proposal removed the events from history and public discussion, at least in the United States. In Israel, in contrast, even conservative Middle East specialists recognize that Israel may have "missed a historic opportunity" in 1971 (Itamar Rabinovitch, asking whether Israel also missed such an opportunity when a Syrian proposal was rejected in 1949).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT29" HREF="#FN29">29</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Jarring-Sadat proposal was virtually identical to official US policy, formulated in the State Department plan of December 1969 (the Rogers Plan). It also conformed to the general interpretation of UN 242 outside of Israel. The Rogers plan suggests that this was also the US interpretation at the time, a conclusion supported by other evidence. In an important article in a British Middle East journal, Donald Neff, a well-known US journalist and historian specializing on Middle East affairs, reviews a State Department study based on records of the 1967 negotiations.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT30" HREF="#FN30">30</A></FONT></SUP> This study, leaked to Neff, has been kept secret "so as not to embarrass Israel," Neff concludes. The study quotes the chief American negotiator, Arthur Goldberg, who was strongly pro-Israel. Goldberg informed King Hussein of Jordan that the US "could not guarantee that everything would be returned to Jordan; some territorial adjustments would be required," but there must be "a mutuality in adjustments." Secretary of State Dean Rusk confirmed to Hussein that the US "would use its influence to obtain compensation to Jordan for any territory it was required to give up," citing examples. Goldberg informed officials of other Arab states "that the United States did not conceive of any substantial redrawing of the map." Israel's withdrawal would be "total except for minor adjustments," Goldberg assured the Arabs, with compensation to Jordan for any such adjustments. His assurances led them to agree to UN 242. In a private communication to Neff, Dean Rusk recently affirmed that "We never contemplated any significant grant of territory to Israel as a result of the June 1967 war."  The US interpretation of UN 242 contemplated "minor adjustments in the western frontier of the West Bank," "demilitarization measures in the Sinai and Golan Heights," and "a fresh look" at the status of Jerusalem. "Resolution 242 never contemplated the movement of any significant territories to Israel," Rusk concluded.

<P>Advocates of Israeli policies in the United States commonly claim that this interpretation of UN 242 is contrary to the stand taken by Arthur Goldberg and the US government generally. Thus the news columns of the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> inform us that the Israeli version of UN 242, which permits Israel to incorporate unspecified parts of the conquered territories, is "supported by Arthur J. Goldberg," citing later comments of his in which he did indeed support the Israeli version.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT31" HREF="#FN31">31</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>One of the more extreme apologists, Yale Law professor and former government official Eugene Rostow, claims that he "helped produce" UN 242, and has repeatedly argued that it authorizes continued Israeli control over the territories. In response to his claims, David Korn, former State Department office director for Israel and Arab-Israeli affairs, wrote in November 1991 that helped produce' Resolution 242, but in fact he had little if anything to do with it." He was an "onlooker," like "many others who have claimed a hand in it." "It was U.S. policy at the time and for several years afterward," Korn continues, "that [any border] changes would be no more than minor." Korn confirms that "Both Mr. Goldberg and Secretary of State Dean Rusk told King Hussein that the United States would use its influence to obtain territorial compensation from Israel for any West Bank lands ceded by Jordan to Israel," and that Jordan's acquiescence was based on these promises. Rostow's pathetic and evasive response contests none of these statements.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT32" HREF="#FN32">32</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The available evidence leads us to conclude that the US kept to the international consensus until February 1971, when it rejected the Jarring-Sadat initiative. US isolation increased in the mid-1970s as the international consensus shifted to recognition of a Palestinian right of self-determination. Since February 1971, the US has been essentially alone in blocking the "peace process." The standard version here is quite different, of course.

<P>Kissinger's support for Israeli intransigence led directly to the 1973 war. Sadat's repeated warnings that he would go to war if the US and Israel continued to block any diplomatic initiatives were dismissed during this period of extreme US-Israeli triumphalism, on the assumption that Israel's power was overwhelming and "war is not the Arab's game," as explained by Israeli Arabist and director of military intelligence General Yehoshaphat Harkabi (now a dove), in a statement less extreme than many. General Ariel Sharon's ravings were particularly noteworthy.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT33" HREF="#FN33">33</A></FONT></SUP> On the same assumptions, the US rebuffed Sadat's offers to drop Soviet patronage and transform Egypt to a US client state.

<P>The 1973 war shattered these illusions. It turned out to be a near thing, and Henry Kissinger, no great genius but able to recognize the mailed fist, realized that policy must shift. The US then turned to the natural fall-back position. Since Egypt could not simply be dismissed as a basket case, the obvious strategy was to accept it as a US client state and remove it from the conflict. This was the goal of Kissinger's "step-by-step" diplomacy, a process accelerated by Sadat's 1977 trip to Jerusalem and finally consummated at Camp David, over the strong objections of leading elements of the (by then, opposition) Labor party, because the treaty required that Israel abandon the northeastern Sinai settlements that Labor had established.

<P>The import of the Camp David settlement was obvious at once. With the major Arab deterrent removed from the conflict and a huge increase in US aid, Israel would be free to accelerate its takeover of the occupied territories and to invade Lebanon, which it had subjected to devastating bombardment and occasional terrorist attack for years, as part of its interaction with the PLO in southern Lebanon. In 1978, Israel invaded Lebanon, killing several thousand people, driving out hundreds of thousands more, and placing the southern zone under the rule of a murderous client force. Israel still remains in defiance of UN Security Council resolution 425 (March 1978) ordering it to withdraw from Lebanon unconditionally and immediately. In 1982 Israel invaded again after a year of Israeli terror attacks intended (in vain) to elicit some PLO response that would serve as a pretext for its plan to destroy the PLO as a political force, thus ensuring Israeli control over the occupied territories while placing Lebanon under Israeli suzerainty. The 1982 invasion was far more devastating, with over 20,000 killed, mostly civilians. Integration of the occupied territories meanwhile continued apace.

<P>The obvious import of Camp David is by now sometimes acknowledged, in Israel, quite frankly. Israeli strategic analyst Avner Yaniv writes that the effect of the Camp David agreement, removing Egypt from the conflict, was that "Israel would be free to sustain military operations against the PLO in Lebanon as well as settlement activity on the West Bank."  Expressing a widely-held consensus among Israeli experts and political figures, he adds that the 1982 invasion of Lebanon was intended to "undermine the position of the moderates within [the peace offensive' " and "to halt [the PLO's] rise to political respectability." It should be called "the war to safeguard the occupation of the West Bank," General Harkabi observes, having been motivated by Begin's "fear of the momentum of the peace process." The US backed the Israeli invasion, presumably for the same reasons, well-known at the time, unless we are willing to attribute to US intelligence and planners an extraordinary level of ignorance and stupidity.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT34" HREF="#FN34">34</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Camp David accords offered the Palestinians limited "autonomy" under Israeli rule for an interim period. Israel and Egypt agreed on specifics by 1980, according to US mediator Sol Linowitz, who regards the Palestinian rejection of this offer as a tragic error on their part, noting accurately that the 1980 proposal is the most they can expect from the US and Israel today. Palestinians rejected it at the time, Linowitz notes, on the grounds that it would preclude authentic self-government in an independent state, and they also objected to the exclusion of their political representatives, the PLO, a stand that Linowitz regards as completely unreasonable -- for Palestinians, not Jews. Reporting Linowitz's views, <CITE>New York Times</CITE> correspondent Sabra Chatrand adds that Likud Prime Minister Menahem Begin favored the autonomy proposal "because the idea seemed to resolve the Palestinian issue while leaving Israel in fundamental control of West Bank and Gaza" -- precisely the point at the time, and still today.

<P>Neither Chatrand nor Linowitz see any merit in the Palestinian unwillingness to "leave Israel in fundamental control of West Bank and Gaza." On the rejectionist assumptions that are an entry ticket to polite society in the United States, Palestinian unhappiness with such an outcome merely reveals that Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity, in a standard formula. The racist undertones also provide more than a little insight into the prevailing intellectual culture here. Particularly noteworthy is the praise lavished upon Palestinian negotiators who don't simply hang from trees and brandish submachine guns but speak "poetically" (as Thomas Friedman puts it) and "pragmatically," adapting to US terms while deferring their "unrealistic" demands for the rights granted as a matter of course to the Jewish immigrants who displaced them -- not that they have much of a choice, given the monopoly of violence in the hands of the United States and its Israeli client, and the monolithic system for transforming the real world into images suitable for the needs of domestic power.

<P>Chatrand observes further that "after years of conflict with Israel, uncounted deaths, and even more hardship, Palestinians have abandoned their earlier conditions" -- not the first demonstration of what John Quincy Adams called the "salutary efficacy" of terror. Observing the conventions, Chatrand also reports that the United States, a helpless victim as always, "tried and failed to get Israel to stop building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories," while vastly increasing US aid for their construction.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT35" HREF="#FN35">35</A></FONT></SUP> It could be argued that the Palestinians should have accepted the proposal that left Israel "in fundamental control" of the occupied territories, but it is unlikely that the outcome would have been any different. Those with the guns and the money determine the meaning of the words, and there is little reason to suppose that the US would have chosen not to lend its decisive and active support to Israel's expansion into the territories and attacks on Lebanon had Palestinians agreed to accept Israeli-run "autonomy."

<P>Sadat's 1977 peace initiative was less acceptable from the US-Israeli perspective than his 1971 proposal, because it called for Palestinian self-determination, in accord with the changing international consensus. Nevertheless, Sadat is hailed as one of the grand figures of the modern age for his 1977 efforts, while the 1971 proposal has been removed from history. The reasons are those just reviewed. In 1971, the US backed Israel's rejection of his peace proposal, though it offered nothing to the Palestinians and scarcely deviated from official US policy. Such facts are politically incorrect, therefore banned from history by the guardians of Truth. By 1977, US policy had shifted for the reasons noted, and the US had accepted Egypt as a client state within its regional system. Though of course the US dismissed at once the terms that Sadat proposed in Jerusalem, it could proceed with its own rejectionist project, with Sadat playing his assigned role, therefore achieving heroic stature. As always, history is established by the powerful.

<P>The Camp David agreement is regarded in the US as a great triumph of US diplomacy, and the model for what should come next. That too is understandable, given the actual record.


<H3>The Prospects</H3>

<P>Let us return finally to the three original questions: What is the reason for the timing of the Bush-Baker initiative? Does it signify a departure from the traditional US stand? What is the meaning of the conflicts between the US and Israel?

<P>The most plausible answers seem to be that the initiative is badly needed for domestic and regional political reasons, but otherwise simply extends traditional US goals. The conflicts with Israel remain focussed on the issues that have always been in dispute: the modalities of rejectionism.

<P>The underlying US government thinking has been discussed before in these pages. To review briefly, US diplomacy is guided by a strategic conception that has changed very little over the years. The primary concern is the energy resources of the region, which are to be managed by the "Arab Facade," under the effective control of the US and its British ally. The family dictatorships must be protected from indigenous nationalism by regional enforcers: Turkey, Israel, Iran (under the Shah), Pakistan, etc., the "periphery pact" of Ben-Gurion's hopes and strategy. U.S.-British force lies in reserve. Regional actors are granted rights insofar as they contribute to "stability," a term of art referring to the establishment and enforcement of this system. The Gulf tyrannies naturally have rights, as did Saddam Hussein before he committed the crime of disobedience, the only one that matters, on August 2, 1990. Israel has been regarded as a major component of this system from the 1960s. It has also served US interests worldwide, carrying out tasks that the US had to delegate to others because of domestic opposition or for other reasons, and cooperating in intelligence matters and weapons production and testing. The Palestinians, in contrast, offer neither wealth nor power. Accordingly, they have no rights, by the most elementary principles of statecraft.

<P>The US stance can be traced back to 1948, when the Pentagon, impressed by Israel's victories, recognized it to be the major regional power after Turkey and a potential base for US power. As for the Palestinians, US planners had no reason to question the assessment of Israeli government specialists that the Palestinian refugees "would be crushed": "some of them would die and most of them would turn into human dust and the waste of society, and join the most impoverished classes in the Arab countries." As noted, this was the traditional position of liberal Zionism, and the wording is repeated by such Labor party leaders as Yitzhak Rabin until today. On these assumptions, there has been no need for any concern over the fate of the indigenous population of the former Palestine.

<P>The operative principles were well expressed by <CITE>New Republic</CITE> editor Martin Peretz, one of the more extreme anti-Arab racists and apologists for Israeli atrocities, just before Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, when he advised Israel to administer to the PLO a "lasting military defeat" that "will clarify to the Palestinians in the West Bank that their struggle for an independent state has suffered a setback of many years," the essential purpose of the invasion. Then "the Palestinians will be turned into just another crushed nation, like the Kurds or the Afghans," and the Palestinian problem -- which "is beginning to be boring" -- will be resolved.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT36" HREF="#FN36">36</A></FONT></SUP> His timing may have been off, but basic principles are resilient in states with unchallenged power. Peretz's attitude towards the Kurds also captures US policy succinctly, as we have recently seen once again.

<P>Control over Middle East energy resources provides important leverage in world affairs and guarantees a badly needed flow of capital to the economies of the United States and Britain. The system of regional management has changed in detail, but the operative principles have not. The course of diplomacy is understandable in these terms.

<P>From the US perspective, a preferred outcome of the current diplomatic maneuvers would be: First, an "interim agreement" between Israel and the Palestinians, which would enable Israel to extend its control over the territories within the framework of Labor Party rejectionism; Second, steps toward commercial and diplomatic relations between Israel and the Gulf rulers, thus extending and making somewhat more overt the tacit alliance of the past several decades; Third, arrangements for the Golan Heights that would ensure Israeli control of the crucial water resources while satisfying Syrian nationalist goals, at least symbolically. If the US rejectionist program is not advanced in these ways, the US will easily win a valuable propaganda victory by placing the blame on Middle East fanatics who have disrupted Washington's noble intentions. It is reasonable to expect that the policies of the past years will then be pursued in other ways.

<P>If US interests are reassessed and Washington decides to press Israel beyond what its leadership would accept, Israel does have certain options, despite its extreme dependency on the United States. The nature of these options has been the topic of considerable discussion within Israel. Writing about the matter almost 10 years ago, I quoted Aryeh (Lova) Eliav, one of Israel's best-known doves, who deplored the attitude of "those who brought Samson complex' here, according to which we shall kill and bury all the Gentiles around us while we ourselves shall die with them." Others too regarded the greatest danger facing Israel as the "collective version" of Samson's revenge against the Philistines, recalling Prime Minister Moshe Sharett's diary entries from the 1950s, in which he recorded the "preaching" of high-level Labor party officials "in favor of acts of madness" and "the diabolical lesson of how to set the Middle East on fire" with "acts of despair and suicide" that will terrify the world as "we go crazy," if crossed. Israel's nuclear power, well-known to US authorities for many years, renders such thinking more than empty threats. Writing in 1982, three Israeli strategic analysts observed that Israel's nuclear capacity included missiles able to reach "many targets in southern USSR," a threat -- real or pretended -- that may well be aimed primarily at the United States, putting US planners on notice that pressures on Israel to accede to an unwanted political settlement could lead to an international conflagration. The reasoning was explained further in the Labor party journal <CITE>Davar,</CITE> reporting Israel's reaction to the Saudi peace plan of August 1981, with the "signs of open-mindedness and moderation" that the government of Israel regarded as a serious threat. Israel's response was to send military jets over the oil fields, a warning to the West of Israel's capacity to cause immense destruction to the world's major energy reserves if pressed towards an unwanted peace, <CITE>Davar</CITE> reported.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT37" HREF="#FN37">37</A></FONT></SUP> The world has changed since, but Israel's "Samson option," as Seymour Hersh calls it in a recent book, remains alive.

<P>Serious Israeli analysts today express considerable concern over what may lie ahead. One of Israel's leading military commentators, Lieutenant-Colonel Ron Ben-Yishai, was interviewed recently on the Bush-Baker initiatives. "This might be the last chance we have to make peace," he said. He expected the current diplomatic efforts to fail. This failure will lead to a war, which should last "a minimum of three to four weeks," a "conventional war" with some surface-to-surface missiles but mostly a ground war, with uncertain prospects and surely grim consequences.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT38" HREF="#FN38">38</A></FONT></SUP> There has been a rash of similar predictions, referring to a war with Syria that Israel might initiate with a preemptive strike. The US will surely do what it can to prevent that, but even US power reaches only so far. If the US keeps to its rejectionist stand, Israel will continue to integrate the territories, the core local conflict will remain unresolved, turbulence and antagonisms will fester and intermittently explode, and a stable regional settlement -- let alone a just one  -- is most unlikely.

<H3>Voices from Below</H3>

<P>In concluding its report <CITE>The Challenge to the South,</CITE> the South Commission, chaired by Julius Nyerere and consisting of leading Third World economists, government planners, and others, called for a "new world order" that will respond to "the South's plea for justice, equity, and democracy in the global society" -- with a touch of pathos, perhaps, since its analysis offered little basis for such hopes.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT1" HREF="#FN1">1</A></FONT></SUP> Some months later, George Bush appropriated the phrase "new world order" as part of the rhetorical background for his war in the Gulf. The powerful determine the rules of the game and the meaning of the rhetoric adopted to disguise them. It is George Bush's New World Order, not that of the South Commission, that will prevail. Accordingly, it is not surprising that the Third World did not join in the enthusiastic U.S. welcome for the uplifting vision proclaimed by the President and his Secretary of State.

<P>In earlier articles as Bush's war plans unfolded, I have quoted Third World reactions, including the Iraqi democrats who were rebuffed throughout by Washington and scrupulously excluded from the propaganda system because of their opposition to every phase of U.S. policy: the enthusiastic Reagan-Bush support for their gangster friend as long as he followed orders; the rush to war and barring of the danger of a peaceful negotiated settlement; the slaughter itself; and the support for Saddam Hussein as he crushed the popular uprisings that Bush had called for when it suited his purposes, then abandoned as priorities changed. To survey Third World opinion is no simple matter; the traditional colonial areas are of little interest to Western privilege unless they fall "out of control," at which point there is a quick transition from silence to frenzied abuse. But from what information I can gather, there was broad agreement with the interpretation of the editor of Germany's leading daily, Theo Sommer of <CITE>Die Zeit,</CITE> who saw in the U.S.-U.K. reaction to the Gulf crisis "an unabashed exercise in national self-interest, only thinly veiled by invocations of principle"<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT2" HREF="#FN2">2</A></FONT></SUP> -- invocations that were proclaimed with due pomposity and self-righteousness as long as the interests of power were served thereby.

<P>In a typical Third World reaction, the Jesuit journal <CITE>Proceso</CITE> (El Salvador) warned of the "ominous halo of hypocrisy, the seed of new crises and resentments." The hypocrisy "is extreme in the case of the United States, the leader of the allied forces and the most warmongering of them all." Writing in the Chilean journal <CITE>La Epoca</CITE> under a caricature of Bush in a bathtub filled with war toys, Uruguayan writer Mario Benedetti agreed that Bush has "succeeded in outdoing Saddam in hypocrisy." "When liberation fever hits the United States," he continued, "the alarms sound everywhere, particularly in the Third World," which lacks the Western talent to turn quickly away from "the liberated wreckage" and where it is no secret that "the abyss between the First World and the Third World is wider with each passing day."  There is nothing accidental, he writes, about the resemblance of Bush's phrase "New World Order" to Hitler's "Neue Ordnung" and Mussolini's "Ordine Nuovo." The "express intent" of Bush's Gulf war was nothing other than "to show both the Third World and its old and new European allies that from now on it is the United States that orders, invades, and dictates the law, period." For the Third World, "the combination of the weakening of the USSR and the [U.S.] victory in the Gulf could turn out to be frightening...because of the breakdown of international military equilibrium which somehow served to contain U.S. yearnings for domination"; "the contempt that this triumph has brought about (thirty countries against one) could stimulate even wilder imperalist adventures." For the South, he concludes, the only hope is to pray to every imaginable deity to "try to convince Bush and Powell not to come liberate us."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT3" HREF="#FN3">3</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Few in the former colonial domains would take issue with the judgment of the <CITE>Times of India</CITE> that the traditional warrior states sought a "regional Yalta where the powerful nations agree among themselves to a share of Arab spoils... [The West's] conduct throughout this one month has revealed the seamiest sides of Western civilisation: its unrestricted appetite for dominance, its morbid fascination for hi-tech military might, its alien' cultures, its appalling jingoism...." The general mood was captured by Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns of Sao Paolo, Brazil, who wrote that in the Arab countries "the rich sided with the U.S. government while the <I>millions</I> of poor condemned this military aggression." Throughout the Third World, he continued, "there is hatred and fear: When will they decide to invade us," and on what pretext?<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT4" HREF="#FN4">4</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Prior to the Gulf crisis, the South Commission had given a grim though accurate assessment of the latest phase of the 500-year European assault against the world -- whether called "the Vasco da Gama era," "the Columbian era," "imperialism," "neo-colonialism," or the era of "North-South conflict," the current euphemism. There were some gestures to Third World concerns in the 1970s, the Commission observed, "undoubtedly spurred" by concern over "the newly found assertiveness of the South after the rise in oil prices in 1973" -- which were, incidentally, not entirely unwelcome to the U.S. and U.K., which are producers of high-cost oil, the home of the energy corporations that benefited mightily from the price rise, and the recipients of much of the flow of petrodollars (primarily the U.S.).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT5" HREF="#FN5">5</A></FONT></SUP> As the threat of Southern assertiveness abated, the Commission report continues, the industrial societies lost interest and turned to "a new form of neo-colonialism," monopolizing control over the world economy, undermining the more democratic elements of the United Nations, and in general proceeding to institutionalize "the South's second class status."

<P>Japan and continental Europe recovered from the recession of the early 1980s, though without resuming earlier growth rates. U.S. recovery involved massive borrowing and state stimulation of the economy, mainly through the Pentagon-based public subsidy to high technology industry, along with a sharp increase in protectionist measures and a rise in interest rates. This contributed to the crisis of the South, as interest payments on the debt rose while investment and aid declined, and the wealthy classes invested their riches in the West. There was a huge capital flow from South to North, with effects that were generally catastrophic, apart from the NICs of East Asia, where the state is powerful enough to control capital flight and direct the economy efficiently. The catastrophe of capitalism in the 1980s was mirrored, though to a lesser extent, in Eastern Europe, contributing to the disintegration of the Soviet tyranny and its virtual disappearance from the world scene.

<P>The "New World Order" is perceived in the South, not unrealistically, as a bitter one-sided international class war, with the advanced state capitalist economies and their transnational corporations monopolizing the means of violence and controlling investment, capital, technology, and planning and management decisions at the expense of the huge mass of the population. Local elites in the Southern dependencies can share in the spoils, including, probably, much of the ex-Nomenklatura in the parts of the Soviet system that will revert to their traditional status. The U.S. and U.K., which wield the whip, may well continue their decline toward societies with notable Third World characteristics, dramatically obvious in the inner cities and rural areas.


<H3>Controlling the Plunderers</H3>

<P>In looking ahead to the New World Order, it is useful to recall some well-established truths, rarely voiced because they lack the redeeming value of supporting privilege and power. They are, therefore, deemed unacceptable by the vigilant guardians of political correctness, along with such matters as the U.S. role in international terrorism and human rights abuses, the actual functioning of the doctrinal system in consciousness-lowering, and so on. But they merit consideration on the part of those who hope to understand the world.

<P>North-South relations are based on the principle that the South has a service role. Independent nationalism, interfering with the prerogatives of the rulers, is unacceptable, whatever its political cast. Murderous tyrants are fine as long as they are properly obedient; Saddam Hussein is only the most recent example. But meaningful democracy, which might allow popular pressures on state policy, is a danger unless the institutional foundations of business rule are so firm that basic decision-making is safely protected from challenge. In occupied Europe and Japan after World War II, until this result was achieved the U.S. worked effectively to undermine labor, democratic forces, and the anti-fascist resistance while reinstating the traditional elites, including Nazi and fascist collaborators (simultaneously, domestic U.S. power launched a massive and effective campaign against labor and independent thought and politics). In the less stable societies of the South, the conditions of business rule are often not yet securely established. Therefore any hint of popular organization and meaningful democracy sets off the alarm bells, often a savage reaction as well.

<P>In these respects, nothing has changed. Thus a Latin America Strategy Development Workshop at the Pentagon in September 1990 concludes that current relations with the Mexican dictatorship are "extraordinarily positive," untroubled by stolen elections, death squads, endemic torture, scandalous treatment of workers democracy opening' in Mexico could test the special relationship by bringing into office a government more interested in challenging the U.S. on economic and nationalist grounds," the fundamental concern over many years. The hostility to democracy is taken as uncontroversial -- probably even unnoticed -- by the academic and other participants.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT6" HREF="#FN6">6</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Signs of successful development simply magnify the dangers of independence and, even worse, popular organization: the "virus" might spread and the "rotten apple" might "infect" the barrel as others are tempted to pursue the same path -- the "domino theory" of public rhetoric. As Washington moved to overthrow the first (and last) democratic government in Guatemala in 1953, State Department officials warned that Guatemala "has become an increasing threat to the stability of Honduras and El Salvador. Its agrarian reform is a powerful propaganda weapon; its broad social program of aiding the workers and peasants in a victorious struggle against the upper classes and large foreign enterprises has a strong appeal to the populations of Central American neighbors where similar conditions prevail."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT7" HREF="#FN7">7</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Such thinking is pervasive, and understandable. It will persist, as long as the threat of "broad social programs" of the Guatemalan variety, or other forms of independence, has not been extinguished.  From 1917 into the 1980s, it was possible to portray the rotten apples as agents of the Evil Empire, poised to conquer us and "take what we have," in the words of one of Lyndon Johnson's laments. The paranoid fantasies were not entirely lacking in substance. Targets of U.S. subversion and economic warfare did, naturally, turn to the Soviet Union for support, and U.S.  intervention was constrained by the deterrent effect of Soviet power -- the "international military equilibrium which somehow served to contain U.S. yearnings for domination" (Benedetti).  The Cold War itself had North-South dimensions that should not be ignored. Soviet domains had in part been quasi-colonial dependencies of the West, which were removed from the Third World and pursued an independent path, no longer available "to complement the industrial economies of the West," as a prestigious study group defined the threat of Communism in 1955.  Furthermore, the Soviet Union offered a model of development that was not without appeal in the Third World, particularly in earlier years.

<P>The USSR was, in short, an enormous "rotten apple," and in this case, a menacing one as well. It is understandable, then, that leading scholars should justify the Western invasion of the Soviet Union after the revolution as a defensive action "in response to a profound and potentially far-reaching intervention by the new Soviet government in the internal affairs, not just of the West, but of virtually every country in the world," namely, "the Revolution's challenge...to the very survival of the capitalist order" (John Lewis Gaddis).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT8" HREF="#FN8">8</A></FONT></SUP> The same reasoning applies to a huge country or a speck in the Caribbean: intervention is entirely warranted in defense against a change in the social order, interfering with the service function, and a declaration of revolutionary intentions, particularly when there is a fear that "the rot may spread." Although the Sandinista "Revolution without Borders" was a government-media fabrication, the propaganda images reflected an authentic concern: from the perspective of a hegemonic power, declaration of an intent to provide a model that will inspire others amounts to aggression.

<P>The "Communist" danger was further enhanced by their unfair advantages. The Communists are able to "appeal directly to the masses," President Eisenhower complained. Our plans for "the masses" preclude any such appeal. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, in private conversation with his brother Alan, who headed the CIA, deplored the Communist "ability to get control of mass movements," "something we have no capacity to duplicate." "The poor people are the ones they appeal to and they have always wanted to plunder the rich."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT9" HREF="#FN9">9</A></FONT></SUP> The same concerns extended to "the preferential option for the poor" of the Latin American bishops and other commitments to independent development or democracy -- and also to such friends as Mussolini, Trujillo, Noriega, and Saddam Hussein when they forget their assigned role.

<P>While the end of the Cold War frees the U.S. to exercise violence more readily than before, there are several factors that are likely to inhibit the resort to force. Among them are the successes of the past years in crushing popular nationalist and reform tendencies and the resulting demoralization of "the masses" who seek to "plunder the rich." In the light of these achievements, and the economic catastrophes of the past decade, the "threat of a good example" has been notably reduced. Limited forms of diversity and independence can be tolerated with less concern that they will lead to meaningful change. Control can be exercised by economic measures: structural adjustment, the IMF regimen, selective resort to free trade measures, and so forth.  And although the narrow ideological constraints of elite Western culture protect us from these visions, Third World observers are quite capable of perceiving the savage retribution visited upon those who step on the toes of the master: Vietnam, Nicaragua, Iraq, indeed anyone who does not understand that "What We Say Goes," in the President's fine words.

<P>Another inhibiting factor is that German-led Europe and Japan have their own priorities, which may not conform to those of the United States, though there is a shared interest in subduing Third World independence, and the internationalization of capital gives competition among national states a different cast than in earlier periods. Furthermore, the domestic base for foreign adventures has eroded, both in public attitudes and economic base. Even with privileged access to the profits of Gulf oil production, the long-term prospects for a mercenary state running a global "protection racket," as advocated in sectors of the business press, are not too auspicious. It is, furthermore, not at all clear that a U.S.-dominated Western hemisphere trade bloc can effectively compete with the Japan's Asian "Co-prosperity sphere" and the German-dominated "New Order" in Central and Eastern Europe -- the realization of many of the dreams of Japanese and German fascism, though in a far less virulent form, and much modified because of changes in the international economy.


<H3>The "Gulf War" in Retrospect</H3>

<P>Two crucial events of the recent past are the accelerating breakup of the Soviet system and the Gulf conflict. With regard to the former, the U.S. is largely an observer. As a matter of course, the media must laud George Bush's consummate skill as a statesman and crisis manager, but the ritual exercise lacks spirit. It is plain enough that Washington has little impact on developments and no idea what to do as the Soviet system lurches from one crisis to another. The response to Saddam Hussein's aggression, in contrast, was a Washington operation throughout, with Britain loyally in tow, reflecting the U.S. insistence upon sole authority in the crucial energy-producing regions of the Middle East.

<P>Now that the U.S. has achieved its major aims and there is no longer any need to terrify the domestic public and whip up jingoist hysteria, government-media rhetoric has subsided and it is easier to survey just what happened in the misnamed "Gulf War" -- misnamed, because there never was a war at all, at least, if the concept "war" involves two sides in combat, say, shooting at each other. That didn't happen in the Gulf.

<P>The crisis began with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait a year ago. There was some fighting, leaving hundreds killed according to Human Rights groups. That hardly qualifies as war. Rather, in terms of crimes against peace and against humanity, it falls roughly into the category of the Turkish invasion of northern Cyprus, Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1978, and the U.S. invasion of Panama. In these terms it falls well short of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, and cannot remotely be compared with the near-genocidal Indonesian invasion and annexation of East Timor, to mention only two cases of aggression that are still in progress, with continuing atrocities and with the crucial support of those who most passionately professed their outrage over Iraq's aggression.

<P>During the subsequent months, Iraq was responsible for terrible crimes in Kuwait, with several thousand killed and many tortured. But that is not war; rather, state terrorism, of the kind familiar among U.S. clients.

<P>The second phase of the conflict began with the U.S.-U.K. attack of January 15 (with marginal participation of others). This was slaughter, not war. Tactics were carefully designed to ensure that there would be virtually no combat.

<P>The first component was an aerial attack on the civilian infrastructure, targeting power, sewage and water systems; that is, a form of biological warfare, designed to ensure long-term suffering and death among civilians so that the U.S would be in a good position to attain its political goals for the region. Since the casualties are victims of the United States, we will never have any real idea of the scale of these atrocities, any more than we have any serious idea of the civilian toll in the U.S. wars in Indochina. These are not proper topics for inquiry.

<P>This component of the attack does not qualify as war: rather it is state terrorism on a colossal scale.

<P>The second component of the U.S.-U.K. attack was the slaughter of Iraqi soldiers in the desert, largely unwilling Shi'ite and Kurdish conscripts it appears, hiding in holes in the sand or fleeing for their lives -- a picture quite remote from the Pentagon disinformation relayed by the press about colossal fortifications, artillery powerful beyond our imagining, vast stocks of chemical and biological weapons at the ready, and so on. Pentagon and other sources give estimates in the range of 100,000 defenseless victims killed, about half during the air attack, half during the air-ground attack that followed. Again, this exercise does not qualify as war. In the words of a British observer of the U.S. conquest of the Philippines at the turn of the century, "This is not war; it is simply massacre and murderous butchery." The desert slaughter was a "turkey shoot," as some U.S. forces described it, borrowing the term used by their forebears butchering Filipinos<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT10" HREF="#FN10">10</A></FONT></SUP> -- one of those deeply-rooted themes of the culture that surfaces at appropriate moments, as if by reflex.

<P>The goal of the attack on the civilian society has been made reasonably clear. In plain words, it was to hold the civilian population hostage to achieve a political end: to induce some military officer to overthrow Saddam and wield the "iron fist" as Saddam himself had done with U.S. support before he stepped out of line; any vicious thug will do as long as he shows proper obedience, unlike Saddam, who violated this principle -- the only one that counts, as events once again demonstrate -- in August 1991. State Department reasoning was outlined with admirable clarity by <CITE>New York Times</CITE> chief diplomatic correspondent Thomas Friedman. If the society suffers sufficient pain, Friedman explained, Iraqi generals may topple Mr. Hussein, "and then Washington would have the best of all worlds: an iron-fisted Iraqi junta without Saddam Hussein." The technique of punishing Iraqi civilians may thus succeed in restoring the happy days when Saddam's "iron fist...held Iraq together, much to the satisfaction of the American allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia," not to speak of the boss in Washington, who had no problem with the means employed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT11" HREF="#FN11">11</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The operation of holding a civilian population hostage while tens of thousands die from starvation and disease raises only one problem: unreasonable soft-hearted folk may feel some discomfort at having "sat by and watched a country starve for political reasons," just what will happen, UNICEF director of public affairs Richard Reid predicted, unless Iraq is permitted to purchase "massive quantities of food" -- though it is already far too late for the children under two, who have stopped growing for six or seven months because of severe malnutrition, we learn from his report in the Canadian press. But Bush's ex-pal may help us out of this dilemma. The <CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE> observes that Iraq's "clumsy attempt to hide nuclear-bomb-making equipment from the U.N. may be a blessing in disguise, U.S. officials say. It assures that the allies [read: U.S. and U.K.] can keep economic sanctions in place to squeeze Saddam Hussein without mounting calls to end the penalties for humanitarian reasons."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT12" HREF="#FN12">12</A></FONT></SUP> With luck, then, this huge exercise in state terrorism may proceed unhampered by the bleeding hearts and PC left-fascists.

<P>In keeping with its fabled dedication to international law and morality, the U.S. is naturally demanding that compensation to the victims of Iraq's crimes must have higher priority than any purchase of food that might be allowed -- under U.N. (meaning U.S.) control, of course; a country that commits the crime of disobeying Washington has plainly lost any claim to sovereignty. While proclaiming this stern doctrine with suitable majesty, the Bush Administration was keeping the pressure on Nicaragua to force these miscreants, who committed the same unspeakable crime, to abandon their claims to reparations for a decade of U.S. terror and illegal economic warfare as mandated by the International Court of Justice. Nicaragua finally succumbed, a capitulation scarcely noticed by the media, mesmerized by Washington's lofty rhetoric about Iraq's responsibilities to compensate its victims.

<P>As Third World observers have no difficulty in perceiving, the "ominous halo of hypocrisy" can rise beyond any imaginable level without posing a serious challenge for the cultural commissars of the West.

<P>The third phase of the conflict began immediately after the cease-fire, as Iraqi elite units, who had been largely spared by the U.S. attack, proceeded to slaughter first the Shi'ites of the South and then the Kurds of the North, with the tacit support of the Commander-in-Chief, who had called upon Iraqis to rebel when that suited U.S. purposes, then went fishing when the "iron fist" struck.

<P>Returning from a March 1991 fact-finding mission, Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff member Peter Galbraith reported that the Administration did not even respond to Saudi proposals to assist both Shi'ite and Kurdish rebels, and that the Iraqi military refrained from attacking the rebels until it had "a clear indication that the United States did not want the popular rebellion to succeed." A BBC investigation found that "several Iraqi generals made contact with the United States to sound out the likely American response if they took the highly dangerous step of planning a coup against Saddam," but received no support, concluding that "Washington had no interest in supporting revolution; that it would prefer Saddam Hussein to continue in office, rather than see groups of unknown insurgents take power."  An Iraqi general who escaped to Saudi Arabia told the BBC that "he and his men had repeatedly asked the American forces for weapons, ammunition and food to help them carry on the fight against Saddam's forces." Each request was refused. As his forces fell back towards U.S.-U.K. positions, the Americans blew up an Iraqi arms dump to prevent them from obtaining arms, and then "disarmed the rebels" (John Simpson). Reporting from northern Iraq, ABC correspondent Charles Glass described how "Republican Guards, supported by regular army brigades, mercilessly shelled Kurdish-held areas with Katyusha multiple rocket launchers, helicopter gunships and heavy artillery," while journalists observing the slaughter listened to Gen. Schwartzkopf boasting to his radio audience that "We had destroyed the Republican Guard as a militarily effective force" and eliminated the military use of helicopters.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT13" HREF="#FN13">13</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>This is not quite the stuff of which heroes are fashioned, so the story was finessed at home, though it could not be totally ignored, particularly the attack on the Kurds, with their Aryan features and origins; the Shi'ites, who appear to have suffered even worse atrocities right under the gaze of Stormin' Norman, raised fewer problems, being mere Arabs.  Again, this slaughter hardly qualifies as war.

<P>In the most careful analysis currently available, the Greenpeace International Military Research Group estimates total Kuwaiti casualties at 2-5,000; and Iraqi civilian casualties at 5-15,000 during the air attack, unknown during the ground attack, 20-40,000 during the civil conflict, perhaps another 50,000 civilian deaths from April through July along with another 125,000 deaths among Shi'ite and Kurdish refugees.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT14" HREF="#FN14">14</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In brief, from August 1990 through July 1991, there was little that could qualify as "war." Rather, there was a brutal Iraqi takeover of Kuwait followed by various forms of slaughter and state terrorism, the scale corresponding roughly to the means of violence in the hands of the perpetrators, and their impunity. The distinction between war, on the one hand, and slaughter and state terrorism, on the other, is one that should be observed.


<H3>"The Best of all Worlds"</H3>

<P>Despite its substantial victory, Washington has not yet achieved "the best of all worlds," as Friedman observes, because no suitable clone of the Beast of Baghdad has yet emerged to serve the interests of the U.S. and its regional allies. Needless to say, not everyone shares the Washington-media conception of "the best of all worlds." Well after the hostilities ended, the <CITE>Wall Street Journal,</CITE> to its credit, broke ranks and offered space to a spokesman for the Iraqi democratic opposition, London-based banker Ahmad Chalabi. He described the outcome as "the worst of all possible worlds" for the Iraqi people, whose tragedy is "awesome."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT15" HREF="#FN15">15</A></FONT></SUP> From the perspective of Iraqi democrats, remote from that of Washington and New York, restoration of the "iron fist" would not be "the best of all worlds."

<P>The U.S. propaganda system did face a certain problem as the Bush administration lent its support to Saddam's crushing of the internal opposition. The task was the usual one: To portray Washington's stance, no matter how atrocious, in a favorable light. That was not easy, particularly after months of ranting about George Bush's magnificent show of principle and supreme courage in facing down the reincarnation of Attila the Hun just as he was about to take over the world. But the transition was quick, smooth, and impressive. True, few can approach our devotion to the most august principles. But our moral purity is tempered with an understanding of the need for "pragmatism" and "stability," useful concepts that translate as "Doing what we choose."

<P>In a typical example of the genre, <CITE>New York Times</CITE> Middle East correspondent Alan Cowell attributed the failure of the rebels to the fact that "very few people outside Iraq wanted them to win."  Note that the concept "people" is used here in the conventional Orwellian sense, meaning: "people who count"; many featherless bipeds wanted them to win, but "serious people" did not. The "allied campaign against President Hussein brought the United States and its Arab coalition partners to a strikingly unanimous view," Cowell continues: "whatever the sins of the Iraqi leader, he offered the West and the region a better hope for his country's stability than did those who have suffered his repression."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT16" HREF="#FN16">16</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>This version of the facts, the standard one, merits a few questions. To begin with, who are these "Arab coalition partners"? Answer: six are family dictatorships, established by the Anglo-American settlement to manage Gulf oil riches in the interests of the foreign masters, what the British imperial managers called an "Arab Facade" for the real rulers. The seventh is Syria's Hafez el-Assad, a minority-based tyrant and murderer who is indistinguishable from Saddam Hussein. The last of the coalition partners, Egypt, is the only one that could be called "a country." Though a tyranny, it has a degree of internal freedom.

<P>We therefore naturally turn to the semi-official press in Egypt to verify the <CITE>Times</CITE> report of the "strikingly unanimous view." The article is datelined Damascus, April 10. The day before, Deputy Editor Salaheddin Hafez of Egypt's leading daily, <CITE>al-Ahram,</CITE> commented on Saddam's demolition of the rebels "under the umbrella of the Western alliance's forces." U.S. support for Saddam Hussein proved what Egypt had been saying all along, Hafez wrote. American rhetoric about "the savage beast, Saddam Hussein," was merely a cover for the true goals: to cut Iraq down to size and establish U.S. hegemony in the region. The West turned out to be in total agreement with the beast on the need to "block any progress and abort all hopes, however dim, for freedom or equality and for progress towards democracy," working in "collusion with Saddam himself" if necessary. Speaking abroad at the same time, Ahmad Chalabi bitterly condemned U.S. support for Saddam Hussein's repression, attributing it to the traditional U.S. policy of "supporting dictatorships to maintain stability."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT17" HREF="#FN17">17</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The Egyptian reaction hardly comes as a surprise. Though one could learn little about the matter here, the "victory celebration" in Egypt had been "muted and totally official," correspondent Hani Shukrallah of the London <CITE>Mideast Mirror</CITE> reported from Cairo. Post-cease fire developments "seem to have intensifed the [popular] feelings of anger against the leading members of the anti-Iraq coalition," inspired as well by the report of the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights that "at least 200 Egyptians have been arrested in Kuwait and that many have been subjected to torture on legally unsubstantiated charges of collaboration." The Egyptian press had also bitterly condemned the U.S. conditions imposed on Iraq, a transparent effort to insure U.S.-Israeli military dominance, <CITE>al-Ahram</CITE> charged.  enemy' than allies'," Shukrallah reported as the ground attack ended, particularly the poor and students, three of whom were killed by police in an anti-government demonstration. "Not in over a decade have Egyptians felt and expressed so intently their hostility to the U.S., Israel and the West," political scientist Ahmad Abdallah observed.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT18" HREF="#FN18">18</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Many Egyptians also expressed satisfaction when Scud missiles hit Israel.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT19" HREF="#FN19">19</A></FONT></SUP> Lacking Western enlightenment, they find it hard to understand why it is highly meritorious to demolish Iraq because of its failure to withdraw from Kuwait under the U.S. terms of unconditional surrender, while it is a reversion to Nazism to administer to Israel what amounts to a slap on the wrist, in comparison, for ignoring the order of the U.N. Security Council to withdraw from Lebanon (March 1978, and subsequently) and other condemnations of its terrorism and repression. Backward cultures fail to see what is so obvious to us: orders to Iraq are to be obeyed; orders to Israel demonstrate the inveterate anti-Semitism of the world, and are therefore to be disregarded, just as World Court condemnations of the U.S. merely discredit this "hostile forum," as the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> and others explain.

<P>It is true that there was some regional support for the U.S. stance apart from the friendly club of Arab tyrants. Turkish President Turgut Ozal doubtless nodded his head in agreement. He had made use of the opportunity offered by the Gulf crisis to step up attacks on his own Kurdish population, confident that the U.S. media would judiciously refrain from reporting the bombings of Kurdish villages and the hundreds of thousands of refugees in flight, trying to survive the cold winter in the mountains without aid or provisions. The reader of the European press, human rights reports, or this journal and a few other exotic sources, could learn something of the Winter 1990-91 exploits of the man who George Bush hailed as "a protector of peace" who has joined all of us who "stand up for civilized values around the world." But those who depend on the mass or prestige media were shielded from such improper thoughts.

<P>The U.S. stance also received support in Israel, where many commentators agreed with retiring Chief-of-Staff Dan Shomron that it is preferable for Saddam Hussein to remain in power in Iraq. "We are all with Saddam," one headline read, reporting the view of Labor dove Avraham Burg that "in the present circumstances Saddam Hussein is better than any alternative" and that "a Shi'ite empire" from Iran to the territories would be harmful to Israel. Another leading dove, Ran Cohen of Ratz, also "wants Saddam to continue to rule, so that perhaps the hope for any internal order will be buried" and the Americans will stay in the region and impose a "compromise." Suppression of the Kurds is a welcome development, an influential right-wing commentator explained in the <CITE>Jerusalem Post,</CITE> because of "the latent ambition of Iran and Syria to exploit the Kurds and create a territorial, military, contiguity between Teheran and Damascus -- a contiguity which embodies danger for Israel" (Moshe Zak, senior editor of the mass-circulation daily <CITE>Ma'ariv</CITE>).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT20" HREF="#FN20">20</A></FONT></SUP> None of this makes particularly good copy. Best to leave it in oblivion.

<P>The "strikingly unanimous view" supporting U.S. "pragmatism," then, includes offices in Washington and New York and London, and U.S. clients in the region, but leaves out a few others -- including, notably, Iraqi democrats in exile and the Arab population of the region, insofar as they have any voice in the U.S. client states. Respectable opinion in the United States could not care less, in keeping with the traditional disparagement of the culturally deprived lower orders.


<H3>Marching Forward</H3>

<P>The Gulf "war" having receded into history, we turn to new triumphs, the primary one in the region being James Baker's skillful exploitation of the "window of opportunity" afforded by the U.S. victory to advance the "peace process." His achievements, so the story goes, offer the first real opportunity to advance the long-sought U.S. goals of "territorial compromise" and "land for peace," now that the "rejectionists" are in disarray.

<P>To understand what is happening, we have to begin by translating the rhetoric of political discourse into English. As is familiar, the term "peace process" refers to the process of achieving U.S. goals; it has nothing particularly to do with efforts to reach peace. The "rejectionists" are not those who reject the right to national self-determination of one or the other of the contending parties in the Israel-Palestine conflict; rather, only those who reject <CITE>Israeli</CITE> claims qualify as rejectionists; the indigenous population of the former Palestine lack any comparable rights because they offer nothing to U.S.  power, neither military force, nor wealth, nor anything else that serves to raise the creatures that crawl the earth to the rank of "people." In fact, they are a damned nuisance, stirring up "radical nationalist" (meaning, disobedient) tendencies in the Arab world.

<P>Turning to "land for peace" and "territorial compromise," these terms refer to the traditional position of the Israeli Labor Party (known in the U.S. as "the doves"), which grants Israel control over the usable land and resources of the occupied territories but leaves the population stateless or under Jordanian administration, so that Israel does not have to confront "the demographic problem." The latter is another term of art, referring to the problem of too many Arabs in "the sovereign State of the Jewish people" in Israel or the diaspora, not the state of its citizens. Moderate Palestinian leaders regard these Labor Party proposals as "much worse than the Likud's autonomy plan" under Israeli sovereignty, Israeli dove Shmuel Toledano observes, agreeing that this judgment is "accurate."<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT21" HREF="#FN21">21</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>The U.S. has always preferred Labor Party rejectionism. It is more rational than the variety espoused by the governing Likud party, which has no real provision for the population of the occupied territories, except eventual "transfer" (meaning expulsion) in some manner. In the past, Palestinian refusal to agree to this U.S.-Israeli plan was condemned as "rejectionism," but the term has recently taken on an even more extreme twist to meet current contingencies. By now, the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> editors condemn Arafat's "rejectionism" in demanding that the U.S. allow the PLO to select a Palestinian delegation and guarantee that Israel will give up some occupied land -- "the old rejectionist tunes of Middle Eastern politics," correspondent Judith Miller adds.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT22" HREF="#FN22">22</A></FONT></SUP> Anything short of abject capitulation to the masters, and national suicide with a friendly smile, counts as "rejectionism."

<P>Decoding the rhetoric of political discourse, we see a picture that looks like this. The U.S. triumph in the Gulf has enabled it to establish the rejectionist position it has maintained in international isolation (apart from Israel). The peace process that the world has sought for many years, with surprising unanimity, can now be consigned to the ash heap of history. The U.S. can at last run its own conference, completely excluding its rivals Europe and Japan, always a major goal of U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East, as Kissinger observed. With the Soviet Union gone from the scene, Syria has accepted the fact that the U.S. rules the region alone and has abandoned what is called its "rejectionist stance" in U.S. rhetoric. In this case, the term refers to Syria's support for the international consensus calling for settlement on the internationally recognized (pre-June 1967) borders and full guarantees for all states in the region, including Israel and a new Palestinian state. Those bemused by mere history will recall that these were the terms of the 1976 Security Council resolution proposed by Syria, Jordan and Egypt, with PLO backing, but vetoed by the U.S. and therefore out of official history along with subsequent efforts in the same vein, such annoyances as Egyptian President Sadat's 1971 offer of a full peace treaty offering nothing to the Palestinians (rejected by Israel with U.S. backing), and much else that lacks ideological serviceability.

<P>Another terminological device is the insistence that state-to-state negotiations are the acid test of sincere dedication to a just peace. Israel has always advocated exactly this, thus passing the test with flying colors, as we expect from the state that the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> describes as "the symbol of human decency." The reasoning behind this condition is transparent: it excludes the Palestinians from the start, and thus incorporates the strict rejectionism of the U.S. and Israel within the very framework of negotiations. Enlightened opinion in the U.S. therefore agrees that it is right and just. For essentially the same reason, the U.S. and Israel have always blocked an international conference and demanded that the PLO must be excluded. Virtually any participant in an international conference would express at least token support for Palestinian rights, a sour note that must be silenced. And since the PLO will, naturally, advocate such rights, it has never been accepted as an interlocutor by either Israel or the U.S. -- including the period of the "negotiations" between the U.S. and the P.L.O., an utter fraud, as was well-understood by the Israeli leadership. The facts have been efficiently suppressed here, but are known at least to readers of this journal, so I will not repeat them.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT23" HREF="#FN23">23</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>There has long been a tacit alliance between the "Arab Facade" that manages the energy system and the regional gendarmes that provide protection from nationalist currents -- Israel among them, alongside of Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan -- with U.S.-British power on call if needed, and various modifications as conditions change (e.g., the fall of the Shah). The tacit alliance is coming quite close to the surface now that Arab nationalism has been dealt yet another crushing blow, thanks to the murderous gangster who disobeyed orders, and PLO tactics of more than the usual foolishness. The Arab rulers therefore have less need than before to respond to popular pressures and make pro-Palestinian gestures; accordingly, the prospects for U.S.  rejectionism have advanced several notches.

<P>The U.S.-run "peace conference" will be permitted to discuss only one topic, as James Baker made clear and explicit in 1989: the Shamir Plan, actually the Shamir-Peres Plan of the Likud-Labor coalition, then governing. The basic terms of this Plan, it will be recalled, are that there can be no "additional Palestinian state" (Jordan already being one) and no "change in the status of Judea, Samaria and Gaza other than in accordance with the basic guidelines of the [Israeli] Government," which exclude any Palestinian rights. Palestinians must, furthermore, be denied even the right to select their own representatives to discuss their capitulation to U.S.-Israeli terms (no PLO); and there will be "free elections" under Israeli military rule with much of the Palestinian leadership in prison camps without charges. These terms would be regarded as a sick joke if they were not advocated by the U.S. and its client.

<P>There remain, however, some problems in implementing this project, notably the recalcitrance of both Shamir and Peres, who lead the two major parties (though Labor is in serious decline). Shamir has repeatedly dragged his feet, and Peres is trying to outflank Shamir from the jingoist extreme (what is called "the right"). The difficulties with Shamir are familiar: he is the preferred scapegoat for the media, and his recalcitrance offers the opportunity to present Washington's extreme rejectionist position as a "middle ground," suitably "moderate" and "pragmatic." But it is harder to deal with the stand of the Labor party, traditionally presented as "the good guys" who line up with U.S. positions. Shimon Peres, in particular, has been designated by the media as a man of "healthy pragratism" and a leading dove, deeply troubled by the lack of a "peace movement among the Arab people" such as "we have among the Jewish people," to sample a few of the fairy tales relayed by the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> and its Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent Thomas Friedman.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT24" HREF="#FN24">24</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Peres's current stand is familiar in Labor Party annals. Leading figures in the Labor Party had opposed Menahem Begin's acceptance of the Camp David agreement, a great boon to Israeli power because it removed the sole Arab deterrent (Egypt) from the conflict, thus enabling Israel to accelerate its integration of the occupied territories and attack Lebanon, with massive U.S. assistance. But the agreement compelled Israel to yield settlements that Labor had established in Egyptian territory, eliciting opposition among the top party ranks. Much the same is true today. In the Hebrew press, Knesset Member Yossi Sarid, regarded as a leading dove, writes that in a meeting of the Labor Party Committee on Foreign and Security Affairs, Peres sought to undermine any positive response to the conciliatory stance of Syria that had been welcomed by Prime Minister Shamir. "He, Peres, is attacking Shamir from the right," Uzi Baram of the Labor Party reported. On most matters, Sarid continues, the Labor Party is following the Likud lead, but on the matter of the Golan Heights, Peres is mimicking the fringe rightwing Ha-Tehiya party, denouncing any negotiations with Syria as a trap that must be avoided. Peres's Labor Party rival Yitzhak Rabin took the same position at the meeting. "The stand of the two with regard to the Golan Heights is rejectionist to the point of despair," Sarid writes. Earlier, Rabin had denounced the Baker conference plan as "a deadly trap [for Israel], while Peres demanded that Israel not relinquish the Golan Heights under any circumstances," the press reported. These are matters of no small moment, since, as the military command and military correspondents have been emphasizing, failure to reach an agreement with Syria on the Golan Heights is likely to lead to war in the not-too-distant future.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT25" HREF="#FN25">25</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Peres's stand was in accord with the largest sector of the Kibbutz Movement (Ha-TAKAM), which called for "permanent rule over the Golan Heights" by Israel, and steps for further development of the Heights.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT26" HREF="#FN26">26</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>In fact, there has never been any serious difference between the two major political groupings on the matter of Palestinian rights, which both reject. The U.S. has always backed them in this rejectionist stance. The official reasons are hardly worth even refuting. The real reasons are that a Palestinian state, even if it lacked a pistol or an ally anywhere, would control its own land and resources, and that the U.S. and Israel will not permit. For many years, it has been well-known that Israel relies heavily on West Bank water; control over water has also always been a major reason for Israel's concern over the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon, and any Syrian or Jordanian development projects in the region. Furthermore, some of the most popular suburbs are in the West Bank (including the vastly expanded area called "Jerusalem"). Israel has also benefited from the supercheap Palestinian labor force and a controlled market (meanwhile preventing any independent development), though these needs will reduce if the Arab boycott officially ends, and if enough Soviet Jews can be forced to Israel to do the dirty work that has been assigned to Palestinians.

<P>The issue is not Israel's survival or even its security, which would not be threatened by a Palestinian state. As David Ben-Gurion observed in December 1948, "an Arab state in Western Palestine [that is, West of the Jordan] would be less dangerous than a state linked to Transjordan [now Jordan], and maybe tomorrow to Iraq." Nothing that has happened since has changed that assessment, and an Israel within the internationally-recognized borders could well be integrated into the region as its most technologically advanced and military powerful element. The problem lies elsewhere. It is that under such arrangements, Israel could not "exist according to the scale, spirit, and quality she now embodies," as General Ezer Weizmann explained in justification of Israel's decision to launch the 1967 war by attacking Egypt, at a time when he was air force commander and one of the top military planners.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT27" HREF="#FN27">27</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>To force Soviet Jews to Israel, it is necessary to gain U.S. cooperation in barring their entry. That is readily obtained, with the support of those who had been vociferously calling on the Soviets to "let my people go" -- as long as they go where we tell them to. The <CITE>Jerusalem Post</CITE> quotes Democrat Charles Schumer of New York, a ranking member of the House immigration, refugee and international law committee, who said on August 15 that there would be no increase in the ceiling on Soviet immigration (50,000, with "some 40,000 slots reserved for Jews").  "This comes as a relief to absorption officials [in Israel], who worry that Soviet aliya ["ascent" to Israel] would drop-off dramatically if the U.S. allows more Soviet Jews in," the <CITE>Post</CITE> news report continues. "American Jews and Israel," Schumer explained, "both seem happy with the current equilibrium," effectively barring non-Jews from the U.S. altogether and restricting Jewish immigration sufficiently to ensure that many will be compelled to go to Israel against their will.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT28" HREF="#FN28">28</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Nevertheless, there are some clouds on the horizon. <CITE>Ha'aretz</CITE> reports that a Jewish organization was formed in the United States to campaign for admission of Russian Jews. This dangerous development led to a closed debate of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem, where participants "expressed sharp opposition" to any such plan and agreed that "the other Jewish bodies in the United States should unite to sabotage this attempt, which might harm the immigration of Jews to Israel." These moves extend pressures of many years on American Jewish communities not to provide assistance to refugees from the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Devid Levy was sent to Germany to induce its Government to stop providing refugee status to Soviet Jews. "Our policy...is that Jews should go to Israel," not here, the spokesman for the Israeli Embassy said in Bonn. Michael Kleiner, head of the Immigration and Absorption Department of the Knesset, "sharply attacked the decision of the German government to permit Russian Jews to enter Germany," the Hebrew press reported. Israel is also reported to have persuaded the Soviet Union to deprive departing Jews of Soviet citizenship, to bar return there, a growing problem as many Russian Jews seek to leave Israel despite the serious impediments imposed by its government, including severe financial liabilities.<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT29" HREF="#FN29">29</A></FONT></SUP>

<P>Israel will never agree to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state unless the U.S. withdraws the huge subsidy that maintains it as a wealthy Western society. And that is unlikely. Israel's services as a "strategic asset" have been highly valued for thirty years, with roots extending beyond. The Israeli lobby (not all Jewish, by any means), with its political clout and its finely-honed techniques of defamation, slander, and intimidation is highly effective in containing discussion within the narrow framework of U.S.-Israeli rejectionism and support for Israeli power and repression.

<P>In contrast, the Palestinians, as noted, offer the U.S. nothing, and there is no domestic lobby pressuring for their rights. What is more, anti-Arab racism is endemic, so rampant as to be unnoticed. The concept of "rejectionism," mentioned above, is demonstration enough, with its unquestioned assumption that Jews have rights denied in principle to Palestinians. The same is true of the standard assumption, also taken as uncontroversial, that Palestinians should not even have the minimal right to select their own representatives to negotiate their capitulation.  An editorial in the liberal <CITE>Boston Globe</CITE> calmly observes that the "ultimate control" of terrorists who take hostages is "extermination," referring, of course, to Arab hostage-takers, not to Israel with its hundreds of Lebanese and Palestinian hostages held under grotesque conditions to ensure compliance with Israel's terrorist army in South Lebanon or to induce Lebanese terrorists to release Israeli soldiers captured in the course of Israeli aggression, not to speak of Palestinians kidnapped on the high seas or the tens of thousands who have been jailed without charges in the occupied territories. In the same journal, a lead op-ed derides the "frenzy" of Arab politics which "expresses the resentments of a civilization which has at once been left behind and overwhelmed by modernity" and which must be helped to "accommodate to reality" (Martin Peretz, who reveals his own grasp of reality by accusing Baker of "a fixed animus to the Jewish state").<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT30" HREF="#FN30">30</A></FONT></SUP> One can imagine the reaction to a call for "extermination" of Jews or similar derisive commentary about Jewish culture.

<P>The approved current practice is sanctimonious and patronizing condemnation of the Palestinians for having applauded Saddam Hussein, and for PLO support for Iraq against the U.S. attack (while calling for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait). Therefore, American and Israeli hypocrites argue, the Palestinians have abdicated their right to participate in determining their own fate. Let us put aside the fact that that right had been forcefully rejected by the United States and both Israeli political groupings long before the invasion of Kuwait; one will search far for a U.S. or Israeli commentator in the mainstream who was willing to grant Palestinians even the right to select their own representatives, a right explicitly denied in the Baker-Shamir-Peres plan. Let us consider, however, what the same logic implies about Israel, which not only applauds but directly participates in horrifying atrocities in Latin America, Africa and Asia, not to speak of its loyal support for U.S. aggression in Indochina and elsewhere, and its own shameful crimes. The conclusions are obvious enough, but, again, fail the test of political correctness, and will therefore not be drawn in a well-disciplined and deeply conformist culture.

<P>For Washington's purposes, it is not of great importance that the "peace conference" succeed. If it does, the U.S. will have rammed through its traditional rejectionism, having sucessfully rebuffed the near-unanimous world support for an authentic political settlement. If that comes about, it will be hailed as another triumph for our great Leader, a renewed demonstration of our high-minded benevolence and virtue. The other possibility is that the "peace process" will fail, in which case we will read of "a classic cultural clash between American and Middle Eastern instincts," a conflict between Middle Eastern fanaticism and Baker's "quintessentially American view of the world: that with just a little bit of reasonableness these people should be able to see that they have a shared interest in peace that overrides their historical antipathies" (Thomas Friedman).<SUP><FONT SIZE=2><A NAME="TXT31" HREF="#FN31">31</A></FONT></SUP> It's a win-win situation for U.S. power.


<H3>The "Two Triumphs"</H3>

<P>The "peace process" aside, there is not a great deal that can be brought forth to illustrate U.S. achievements in the Gulf. This too is not much of a problem; as state priorities shift, respectable folk follow suit, turning to approved concerns. But it would have been too much to allow the August 2 anniversary to pass without notice. A last-ditch effort was therefore necessary to portray the outcome as a Grand Victory. Even with the journalistic achievements of the past year, such as the suppression of the possibilities for a peaceful negotiated settlement and the rigorous exclusion of Iraqi democrats and world opinion generally, it was no simple matter to chant the praises of our leader as we survey the scene of two countries devastated, hundreds of thousands of corpses with the toll still mounting, an ecological catastrophe, and the Beast of Baghdad firmly in power thanks to the tacit support of the Bush-Baker-Schwartzkopf team.

<P>It is a relief to discover that even this onerous task was not beyond the capacity of the cultural commissars. In its anniversary editorial, the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> editors dismissed the qualms of "the doubters," concluding that Mr. Bush had acted wisely: he "avoided the quagmire and preserved his two triumphs: the extraordinary cooperation among coalition members and the revived self-confidence of Americans," who "greeted the Feb. 28 cease-fire with relief and pride -- relief at miraculously few U.S. casualties and pride in the brilliant performance of the allied forces" (<CITE>NYT,</CITE> Aug. 2, 1991). Surely these triumphs far outweigh the "awesome tragedies" in the region.

<P>These are chilling words. One can readily understand the reaction of the non-people of the world.

<P>In his study of the Scottish intellectual tradition, George Davie identifies its central theme as a recognition of the fundamental role of "<I>natural beliefs</I> or principles of common sense, such as the belief in an independent external world, the belief in causality, the belief in ideal standards, and the belief in the self of conscience as separate from the rest of one." These principles are sometimes considered to have a regulative character; though never fully justified, they provide the foundations for thought and conception. Some held that they contain "an irreducible element of mystery," Davie points out, while others hoped to provide a rational foundation for them. On that issue, the jury is still out.

<P>We can trace such ideas to 17th century thinkers who reacted to the skeptical crisis of the times by recognizing that there are no absolutely certain grounds for knowledge, but that we do, nevertheless, have ways to gain a reliable understanding of the world and to improve that understanding and apply it -- essentially the standpoint of the working scientist today. Similarly, in normal life a reasonable person relies on the natural beliefs of common sense while recognizing that they may be parochial or misguided, and hoping to refine or alter them as understanding progresses.

<P>Davie credits David Hume with providing this particular cast to Scottish philosophy, and more generally, having taught philosophy the proper questions to ask. One puzzle that Hume posed is particularly pertinent today. In considering the First Principles of Government, Hume found "nothing more surprising" than "to see the easiness with which the many are governed by the few; and to observe the implicit submission with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers. When we enquire by what means this wonder is brought about, we shall find, that as Force is always on the side of the governed, the governors have nothing to support them but opinion. 'Tis therefore, on opinion only that government is founded; and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments, as well as to the most free and most popular."

<P>Hume was an astute observer, and his paradox of government is much to the point. His insight explains why elites are so dedicated to indoctrination and thought control, a major and largely neglected theme of modern history. "The public must be put in its place," Walter Lippmann wrote, so that we may "live free of the trampling and the roar of a bewildered herd," whose "function" is to be "interested spectators of action," not participants. And if the state lacks the force to coerce and the voice of the people can be heard, it is necessary to ensure that that voice says the right thing, as respected intellectuals have been advising for many years.

<P>Hume's observation raises a number of questions. One dubious feature is the idea that force is on the side of the governed. Reality is more grim. A good part of human history supports the contrary thesis put forth a century earlier by advocates of the rule of Parliament against the King, but more significantly against the people: that "the power of the Sword is, and ever hath been, the Foundation of all Titles to Government." Force also has more subtle modes, including an array of costs well short of overt violence that attach to refusal to submit. Nevertheless, Hume's paradox is real. Even despotic rule is commonly founded on a measure of consent, and the abdication of rights is the hallmark of more free societies -- a fact that calls for analysis.  


<H3>The Harsher Side</H3>

<P>The harsher side of the truth is highlighted by the fate of the popular movements of the past decade. In the Soviet satellites, the governors had ruled by force, not opinion. When force was withdrawn, the fragile tyrannies quickly collapsed, for the most part with little bloodshed. These remarkable successes have elicited some euphoria about the power of "love, tolerance, nonviolence, the human spirit, and forgiveness," Vaclav Havel's explanation for the failure of the police and military to crush the Czech uprising. The thought is comforting, but illusory, as even the most cursory look at history reveals. The crucial factor is not some novel form of love and nonviolence; no new ground was broken here. Rather, it was the withdrawal of Soviet force, and the collapse of the structures of coercion based upon it. Those who believe otherwise may turn for guidance to the ghost of Archbishop Romero and countless others who have tried to confront unyielding terror with the human spirit.

<P>The recent events of Eastern and Central Europe are a sharp departure from the historical norm. Throughout modern history, popular forces motivated by radical democratic ideals have sought to combat autocratic rule. Sometimes they have been able to expand the realms of freedom and justice before being brought to heel. Often they are simply crushed. But it is hard to think of another case when established power simply withdrew in the face of a popular challenge. No less remarkable is the behavior of the reigning superpower, which not only did not bar these developments by force as in the past, but even encouraged them, alongside of significant internal changes.

<P>The historical norm is illustrated by the dramatically contrasting case of Central America, where any popular effort to overthrow the brutal tyrannies of the oligarchy and the military is met with murderous force, supported or directly organized by the ruler of the hemisphere. Ten years ago, there were signs of hope for an end to the dark ages of terror and misery, with the rise of self-help groups, unions, peasant associations, Christian base communities, and other popular organizations that might have led the way to democracy and social reform. This prospect elicited a stern response by the United States and its clients, generally supported by its European allies, with a campaign of slaughter, torture, and general barbarism that left societies "affected by terror and panic," "collective intimidation and generalized fear" and "internalized acceptance of the terror," in the words of a Church-based Salvadoran human rights organization. Early efforts in Nicaragua to direct resources to the poor majority impelled Washington to economic and ideological warfare, and outright terror, to punish these transgressions by destroying the economy and social life.

<P>Enlightened Western opinion regards such consequences as a success insofar as the challenge to power and privilege is rebuffed and the targets are properly chosen: killing prominent priests in public view is not clever, but rural activists and union leaders are fair game -- and of course peasants, Indians, students, and other low-life generally. Shortly after the murder of the Jesuit priests in El Salvador in November 1989, the wires carried a story by AP correspondent Douglas Grant Mine entitled "Second Salvador Massacre, but of Common Folk," reporting how soldiers entered a working class neighborhood, captured six men, lined them up against a wall and murdered them, adding a 14-year-old boy for good measure. They "were not priests or human rights campaigners," Mine wrote, "so their deaths have gone largely unnoticed" -- as did his story, which was buried.

<P>"The same week the Jesuits were killed," Central America correspondent Alan Nairn writes, "at least 28 other civilians were murdered in similar fashion. Among them were the head of the water works union, the leader of the organization of university women, nine members of an Indian farming cooperative, ten university students,.... Moreover, serious investigation of the Salvadoran murders leads directly to Washington's doorstep." All "absolutely appropriate," hence unworthy of mention or concern. So the story continues, week after grisly week.

<P>The comparison between the Soviet and U.S. domains is a commonplace outside of culturally deprived sectors of the West, as illustrated in earlier <CITE>Z</CITE> articles. Guatemalan journalist Julio Godoy, who fled when his newspaper, <CITE>La Epoca,</CITE> was blown up by state terrorists (an operation that aroused no interest in the United States; it was not reported, though well-known), writes that Eastern Europeans are, "in a way, luckier than Central Americans": "while the Moscow-imposed government in Prague would degrade and humiliate reformers, the Washington-made government in Guatemala would kill them. It still does, in a virtual genocide that has taken more than 150,000 victims... [in what Amnesty International calls] a `government program of political murder'." That, he suggested, is "the main explanation for the fearless character of the students' recent uprising in Prague: the Czechoslovak Army doesn't shoot to kill.... In Guatemala, not to mention El Salvador, random terror is used to keep unions and peasant associations from seeking their own way" -- and to ensure that the press conforms, or disappears, so that Western liberals need not fret over censorship in the "fledgling democracies" they applaud.

<P>Godoy quotes a European diplomat who says, "as long as the Americans don't change their attitude towards the region, there's no space here for the truth or for hope." Surely no space for nonviolence and love.

<P>One will search far to find such truisms in U.S. commentary, or the West in general, which much prefers largely meaningless (though self-flattering) comparisons between Eastern and Western Europe. Nor is the hideous catastrophe of capitalism in the past years a major theme of contemporary discourse, a catastrophe that is dramatic in Latin America and other domains of the industrial West, in the "internal Third World" of the United States, and the "exported slums" of Europe. Nor are we likely to find much attention to the fact, hard to ignore, that the economic success stories typically involve coordination of the state and financial-industrial conglomerates, another sign of the collapse of capitalism in the past 60 years. It is only the Third World that is to be subjected to the destructive forces of free market capitalism, so that it can be more efficiently robbed and exploited by the powerful.

<P>Central America represents the historical norm, not Eastern Europe. Hume's observation requires this correction. Recognizing that, it remains true, and important, that government is typically founded on modes of submission short of force, even where force is available as a last resort.  


<H3>The Bewildered Herd And Its Shepherds</H3>

<P>In the contemporary period, Hume's insight has been revived and elaborated, but with a crucial innovation: control of thought is <I>more</I> important for governments that are free and popular than for despotic and military states. The logic is straightforward. A despotic state can control its domestic enemy by force, but as the state loses this weapon, other devices are required to prevent the ignorant masses from interfering with public affairs, which are none of their business. These prominent features of modern political and intellectual culture merit a closer look.

<P>The problem of "putting the public in its place" came to the fore with what one historian calls "the first great outburst of democratic thought in history," the English revolution of the 17th century. This awakening of the general populace raised the problem of how to contain the threat.

<P>The libertarian ideas of the radical democrats were considered outrageous by respectable people. They favored universal education, guaranteed health care, and democratization of the law, which one described as a fox, with poor men the geese: "he pulls off their feathers and feeds upon them." They developed a kind of "liberation theology" which, as one critic ominously observed, preached "seditious doctrine to the people" and aimed "to raise the rascal multitude...against all men of best quality in the kingdom, to draw them into associations and combinations with one another...against all lords, gentry, ministers, lawyers, rich and peaceable men" (historian Clement Walker). Particularly frightening were the itinerant workers and preachers calling for freedom and democracy, the agitators stirring up the rascal multitude, and the printers putting out pamphlets questioning authority and its mysteries. "There can be no form of government without its proper mysteries," Walker warned, mysteries that must be "concealed" from the common folk: "Ignorance, and admiration arising from ignorance, are the parents of civil devotion and obedience," a thought echoed by Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor. The radical democrats had "cast all the mysteries and secrets of government...before the vulgar (like pearls before swine)," he continued, and have "made the people thereby so curious and so arrogant that they will never find humility enough to submit to a civil rule." It is dangerous, another commentator ominously observed, to "have a people know their own strength." The rabble did not want to be ruled by King or Parliament, but "by countrymen like ourselves, that know our wants." Their pamphlets explained further that "It will never be a good world while knights and gentlemen make us laws, that are chosen for fear and do but oppress us, and do not know the people's sores."

<P>These ideas naturally appalled the men of best quality. They were willing to grant the people rights, but within reason, and on the principle that "when we mention the people, we do not mean the confused promiscuous body of the people." After the democrats had been defeated, John Locke commented that "day-labourers and tradesmen, the spinsters and dairymaids" must be told what to believe: "The greatest part cannot know and therefore they must believe."

<P>Like John Milton and other civil libertarians of the period, Locke held a sharply limited conception of freedom of expression. His Fundamental Constitution of Carolina barred those who "speak anything in their religious assembly irreverently or seditiously of the government or governors, or of state matters." The constitution guaranteed freedom for "speculative opinions in religion," but not for political opinions. "Locke would not even have permitted people to discuss public affairs," Leonard Levy observes. The constitution provided further that "all manner of comments and expositions on any part of these constitutions, or on any part of the common or statute laws of Carolines, are absolutely prohibited." In drafting reasons for Parliament to terminate censorship in 1694, Locke offered no defense of freedom of expression or thought, but only considerations of expediency and harm to commercial interests. With the threat of democracy overcome and the libertarian rabble dispersed, censorship was permitted to lapse in England, because the "opinion-formers...censored themselves. Nothing got into print which frightened the men of property," Christopher Hill comments. In a well-functioning state capitalist democracy like the United States, what might frighten the men of property is generally kept far from the public eye -- sometimes, with quite astonishing success.

<P>Such ideas have ample resonance until today, including Locke's stern doctrine that the common people should be denied the right even to discuss public affairs. This doctrine remains a basic principle of modern democratic states, now implemented by a variety of means to protect the operations of the state from public scrutiny: classification of documents on the largely fraudulent pretext of national security, clandestine operations, and other measures to bar the rascal multitude from the political arena. Such devices typically gain new force under the regime of statist reactionaries of the Reagan-Thatcher variety. The same ideas frame the essential professional task and responsibility of the intellectual community: to shape the perceived historical record and the picture of the contemporary world in the interests of the powerful, thus ensuring that the public keeps to its place and function, properly bewildered.

<P>In the 1650s, supporters of Parliament and the army against the people easily proved that the rabble could not be trusted. This was shown by their lingering monarchist sentiments and their reluctance to place their affairs in the hands of the gentry and the army, who were "truly the people," though the people in their foolishness did not agree. The mass of the people are a "giddy multitude," "beasts in men's shapes." It is proper to suppress them, just as it is proper "to save the life of a lunatique or distracted person even against his will." If the people are so "depraved and corrupt" as to "confer places of power and trust upon wicked and undeserving men, they forfeit their power in this behalf unto those that are good, though but a few."

<P>The good and few may be the gentry or industrialists, or the vanguard Party and the Central Committee, or the intellectuals who qualify as "experts" because they articulate the consensus of the powerful (to paraphrase one of Henry Kissinger's insights). They manage the business empires, ideological institutions, and political structures, or serve them at various levels. Their task is to shepherd the bewildered herd and keep the giddy multitude in a state of implicit submission, and thus to bar the dread prospect of freedom and self-determination.

<P>Similar ideas have been forged as the Spanish explorers set about what Tzvetan Todorov calls "the greatest genocide in human history" after they "discovered America" 500 years ago. They justified their acts of terror and oppression on the grounds that the natives are not "capable of governing themselves any more than madmen or even wild beasts and animals, seeing that their food is not any more agreeable and scarcely better than that of wild beasts" and their stupidity "is much greater than that of children and madmen in other countries" (professor and theologian Francisco de Vitoria, "one of the pinnacles of Spanish humanism in the sixteenth century"). Therefore, intervention is legitimate "in order to exercise the rights of guardianship," Todorov comments, summarizing de Vitoria's basic thought.

<P>When English savages took over the task a few years later, they naturally adopted the same pose while taming the wolves in the guise of men, as George Washington described the objects that stood in the way of the advance of civilization and had to be eliminated for their own good. The English colonists had already handled the Celtic "wild men" the same way, for example, when Lord Cumberland, known as "the butcher," laid waste to the Scottish highlands before moving on to pursue his craft in North America.

<P>One hundred and fifty years later, their descendants had purged North America of this native blight, reducing the lunatics from 10 million to 200,000 according to some recent estimates, and they turned their eyes elsewhere, to civilize the wild beasts in the Philippines. The Indian fighters to whom President McKinley assigned the task of "Christianizing" and "uplifting" these unfortunate creatures rid the liberated islands of hundreds of thousands of them, accelerating their ascent to heaven. They too were rescuing "misguided creatures" from their depravity by "slaughtering the natives in English fashion," as the New York described their painful responsibility, adding that we must take "what muddy glory lies in the wholesale killing til they have learned to respect our arms," then moving on to "the more difficult task of getting them to respect our intentions."

<P>This is pretty much the course of history, as the plague of European civilization devastated much of the world.

<P>On the home front, the continuing problem was formulated plainly by the 17th century political thinker Marchamont Nedham. The proposals of the radical democrats, he wrote, would result in "ignorant Persons, neither of Learning nor Fortune, being put in Authority." Given their freedom, the "self-opinionated multitude" would elect "the <I>lowest of the People</I>" who would occupy themselves with "Milking and Gelding the Purses of the Rich," taking "the ready Road to all licentiousness, mischief, mere Anarchy and Confusion." These sentiments are the common coin of modern political and intellectual discourse; increasingly so as popular struggles did succeed, over the centuries, in realizing the proposals of the radical democrats, so that ever more sophisticated means had to be devised to reduce their substantive content.

<P>Such problems regularly arise in periods of turmoil and social conflict. After the American revolution, rebellious and independent farmers had to be taught by force that the ideals expressed in the pamphlets of 1776 were not to be taken seriously. The common people were not to be represented by countrymen like themselves, that know the people's sores, but by gentry, merchants, lawyers, and others who hold or serve private power. Jefferson and Madison believed that power should be in the hands of the "natural aristocracy," Edmund Morgan comments, "men like themselves" who would defend property rights against Hamilton's "paper aristocracy" and from the poor; they "regarded slaves, paupers, and destitute laborers as an ever-present danger to liberty as well as property." The reigning doctrine, expressed by the Founding Fathers, is that "the people who own the country ought to govern it" (John Jay). The rise of corporations in the 19th century, and the legal structures devised to grant them dominance over private and public life, established the victory of the Federalist opponents of popular democracy in a new and powerful form.

<P>Not infrequently, revolutionary struggles pit aspirants to power against one another though united in opposition to radical democratic tendencies among the common people. Lenin and Trotsky, shortly after seizing state power in 1917, moved to dismantle organs of popular control, including factory councils and Soviets, thus proceeding to deter and overcome socialist tendencies. An orthodox Marxist, Lenin did not regard socialism as a viable option in this backward and underdeveloped country; until his last days, it remained for him an "elementary truth of Marxism, that the victory of socialism requires the joint efforts of workers in a number of advanced countries," Germany in particular. In what has always seemed to me his greatest work, George Orwell described a similar process in Spain, where the Fascists, Communists, and liberal democracies were united in opposition to the libertarian revolution that swept over much of the country, turning to the conflict over the spoils only when popular forces were safely suppressed. There are many examples, often influenced by great power violence.

<P>This is particularly true in the Third World. A persistent concern of Western elites is that popular organizations might lay the basis for meaningful democracy and social reform, threatening the prerogatives of the privileged. Those who seek "to raise the rascal multitude" and "draw them into associations and combinations with one another" against "the men of best quality" must, therefore, be repressed or eliminated. It comes as no surprise that Archbishop Romero should be assassinated shortly after urging President Carter to withhold military aid from the governing junta, which, he warned, will use it to "sharpen injustice and repression against the people's organizations" struggling "for respect for their most basic human rights."

<P>The threat of popular organization to privilege is real enough in itself. Worse still, "the rot may spread," in the terminology of political elites; there may be a demonstration effect of independent development in a form that attends to the people's sores. Internal documents and even the public record reveal that a driving concern of U.S. planners has been the fear that the "virus" might spread, "infecting" regions beyond.

<P>This concern breaks no new ground. European statesmen had feared that the American revolution might "lend new strength to the apostles of sedition" (Metternich), and might spread "the contagion and the invasion of vicious principles" such as "the pernicious doctrines of republicanism and popular selfrule," one of the Czar's diplomats warned. A century later, the cast of characters was reversed. Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of State Robert Lansing feared that if the Bolshevik disease were to spread, it would leave the "ignorant and incapable mass of humanity dominant in the earth"; the Bolsheviks, he continued, were appealing "to the proletariat of all countries, to the ignorant and mentally deficient, who by their numbers are urged to become masters, ...a very real danger in view of the process of social unrest throughout the world." Again it is democracy that is the awesome threat. When soldiers and workers councils made a brief appearance in Germany, Wilson feared that they would inspire dangerous thoughts among "the American negro [soldiers] returning from abroad." Already, he had heard, negro laundresses were demanding more than the going wage, saying that "money is as much mine as it is yours." Businessmen might have to adjust to having workers on their boards of directors, he feared, among other disasters, if the Bolshevik virus were not exterminated.

<P>With these dire consequences in mind, the Western invasion of the Soviet Union was justified on defensive grounds, against "the Revolution's challenge...to the very survival of the capitalist order" (John Lewis Gaddis). And it was only natural that the defense of the United States should extend from invasion of the Soviet Union to Wilson's Red Scare at home. As Lansing explained, force must be used to prevent "the leaders of Bolshevism and anarchy" from proceeding to "organize or preach against government in the United States"; the government must not permit "these fanatics to enjoy the liberty which they now seek to destroy." The repression launched by the Wilson administration successfully undermined democratic politics, unions, freedom of the press, and independent thought, in the interests of corporate power and the state authorities who represented its interests, all with the general approval of the media and elites generally, all in self-defense against the "ignorant and mentally deficient" majority. Much the same story was re-enacted after World War II, again under the pretext of a Soviet threat, in reality, to restore submission to the rulers.

<P>When political life and independent thought revived in the 1960s, the problem arose again, and the reaction was the same. The Trilateral Commission, bringing together liberal elites from Europe, Japan, and the United States, warned of an impending "crisis of democracy" as segments of the public sought to enter the political arena. This "excess of democracy" was posing a threat to the unhampered rule of privileged elites -- what is called "democracy" in political theology. The problem was the usual one: the rabble were trying to manage their own affairs, gaining control over their communities and pressing their political demands. There were organizing efforts among young people, ethnic minorities, women, social activists, and others, encouraged by the struggles of benighted masses elsewhere for freedom and independence. More "moderation in democracy" would be required, the Commission concluded, perhaps a return to the days when "Truman had been able to govern the country with the cooperation of a relatively small number of Wall Street lawyers and bankers," as the American rapporteur commented.

<P>The fears expressed by the men of best quality in the 17th century have become a major theme of intellectual discourse, corporate practice, and the academic social sciences. They were expressed by the influential moralist and foreign affairs adviser Reinhold Niebuhr, who was revered by George Kennan, the Kennedy intellectuals, and many others. He wrote that "rationality belongs to the cool observers" while the common person follows not reason but faith. The cool observers, he explained, must recognize "the stupidity of the average man," and must provide the "necessary illusion" and the "emotionally potent oversimplifications" that will keep the naive simpletons on course. As in 1650, it remains necessary to protect the "lunatic or distracted person," the ignorant rabble, from their own "depraved and corrupt" judgments, just as one does not allow a child to cross the street without supervision.

<P>In accordance with the prevailing conceptions, there is no infringement of democracy if a few corporations control the information system: in fact, that is the essence of democracy. The leading figure of the public relations industry, Edward Bernays, explained that "the very essence of the democratic process" is "the freedom to persuade and suggest," what he calls "the engineering of consent." If the freedom to persuade happens to be concentrated in a few hands, we must recognize that such is the nature of a free society.

<P>Bernays expressed the basic point in a public relations manual of 1928: "The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society... It is the intelligent minorities which need to make use of propaganda continuously and systematically." Given its enormous and decisive power, the highly class conscious business community of the United States has been able to put these lessons to effective use. Bernays' advocacy of propaganda is cited by Thomas McCann, head of public relations for the United Fruit Company, for which Bernays provided signal service in preparing the ground for the overthrow of Guatemalan democracy in 1954, a major triumph of business propaganda with the willing compliance of the media.

<P>The intelligent minorities have long understood this to be their function. Walter Lippmann described a "revolution" in "the practice of democracy" as "the manufacture of consent" has become "a self-conscious art and a regular organ of popular government." This is a natural development when public opinion cannot be trusted: "In the absence of institutions and education by which the environment is so successfully reported that the realities of public life stand out very sharply against self-centered opinion, the common interests very largely elude public opinion entirely, and can be managed only by a specialized class whose personal interests reach beyond the locality," and are thus able to perceive "the realities." These are the men of best quality, who alone are capable of social and economic management.

<P>It follows that two political roles must be clearly distinguished, Lippmann goes on to explain. First, there is the role assigned to the specialized class, the "insiders," the "responsible men," who have access to information and understanding. Ideally, they should have a special education for public office, and should master the criteria for solving the problems of society: "In the degree to which these criteria can be made exact and objective, political decision," which is their domain, "is actually brought into relation with the interests of men." The "public men" are, furthermore, to "lead opinion" and take the responsibility for "the formation of a sound public opinion." "They initiate, they administer, they settle," and should be protected from "ignorant and meddlesome outsiders," the general public, who are incapable of dealing "with the substance of the problem." The criteria we apply to government are success in satisfying material and cultural wants, not whether "it vibrates to the self-centered opinions that happen to be floating in men's minds." Having mastered the criteria for political decision, the specialized class, protected from public meddling, will serve the public interest -- what is called "the national interest" in the webs of mystification spun by the academic social sciences and political commentary.

<P>The second role is "the task of the public," which is much more limited. It is not for the public, Lippmann observes, to "pass judgment on the intrinsic merits" of an issue or to offer analysis or solutions, but merely, on occasion, to place "its force at the disposal" of one or another group of "responsible men." The public "does not reason, investigate, invent, persuade, bargain, or settle." Rather, "the public acts only by aligning itself as the partisan of someone in a position to act executively," once he has given the matter at hand sober and disinterested thought. It is for this reason that "the public must be put in its place." The bewildered herd, trampling and roaring, "has its function": to be "the interested spectators of action," not participants. Participation is the duty of "the responsible man."

<P>These ideas, described by Lippmann's editors as a progressive "political philosophy for liberal democracy," have an unmistakeable resemblance to the Leninist concept of a vanguard party that leads the masses to a better life that they cannot conceive or construct on their own. In fact, the transition from one position to the other, from Leninist enthusiasm to "celebration of America," has proven quite an easy one over the years. This is not surprising, since the doctrines are similar at their root. The critical difference lies in an assessment of the prospects for power: through exploitation of mass popular struggle, or service to the current masters.

<P>There is, clearly enough, an unspoken assumption behind the proposals of Lippmann and others: the specialized class are offered the opportunity to manage public affairs by virtue of their subordination to those with real power -- in our societies, dominant business interests -- a crucial fact that is ignored in the self-praise of the elect.

<P>Lippmann's thinking on these matters dates from shortly after World War I, when the liberal intellectual community was much impressed with its success in serving as "the faithful and helpful interpreters of what seems to be one of the greatest enterprises ever undertaken by an American president" (<CITE>New Republic</CITE>). The enterprise was Woodrow Wilson's interpretation of his electoral mandate for "peace without victory" as the occasion for pursuing victory without peace, with the assistance of the liberal intellectuals, who later praised themselves for having "impose[d] their will upon a reluctant or indifferent majority," with the aid of propaganda fabrications about Hun atrocities and other such devices. They were serving, often unwittingly, as instruments of the British Ministry of Information, which secretly defined its task as "to direct the thought of most of the world."

<P>Fifteen years later, the influential political scientist Harold Lasswell explained in the <CITE>Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences</CITE> that when elites lack the requisite force to compel obedience, social managers must turn to "a whole new technique of control, largely through propaganda." He added the conventional justification: we must recognize the "ignorance and stupidity [of] ...the masses" and not succumb to "democratic dogmatisms about men being the best judges of their own interests." They are not, and we must control them, for their own good. The same principle guides the business community. Others have developed similar ideas, and put them into practice in the ideological institutions: the schools, the universities, the popular media, the elite journals, and so on. A challenge to these ideas arouses trepidation, sometimes fury, as when students of the 1960s, instead of simply bowing to authority, began to ask too many questions and to explore beyond the bounds established for them. The pretense of manning the ramparts against the onslaught of the barbarians, now a popular pose, is scarcely more than comical fraud.

<P>The doctrines of Lippmann, Lasswell, and others are entirely natural in any society in which power is narrowly concentrated but formal mechanisms exist by which ordinary people may, in theory, play some role in shaping their own affairs -- a threat that plainly must be barred.

<P>The techniques of manufacture of consent are most finely honed in the United States, a more advanced business-run society than its allies and one that is in important ways more free than elsewhere, so that the ignorant and stupid masses are more dangerous. But the same concerns arise in Europe, as in the past, heightened by the fact that the European varieties of state capitalism have not yet progressed as far as the United States in eliminating labor unions and other impediments to rule by men (and occasionally women) of best quality, thus restricting politics to factions of the business party. The basic problem, recognized throughout, is that as the state loses the capacity to control the population by force, privileged sectors must find other methods to ensure that the rascal multitude is removed from the public arena. And the insignificant nations must be subjected to the same practices as the insignificant people. Liberal doves hold that others should be free and independent, but not free to choose in ways that we regard as unwise or contrary to our interests, a close counterpart to the prevailing conception of democracy at home as a form of population control.

<P>A properly functioning system of indoctrination has a variety of tasks, some rather delicate. One of its targets is the stupid and ignorant masses. They must be kept that way, diverted with emotionally potent oversimplifications, marginalized, and isolated. Ideally, each person should be alone in front of the TV screen watching sports, soap operas, or comedies, deprived of organizational structures that permit individuals lacking resources to discover what they think and believe in interaction with others, to formulate their own concerns and programs, and to act to realize them. They can then be permitted, even encouraged, to ratify the decisions of their betters in periodic elections. The rascal multitude are the proper targets of the mass media and a public education system geared to obedience and training in needed skills, including the skill of repeating patriotic slogans on timely occasions.

<P>For submissiveness to become a reliable trait, it must be entrenched in every realm. The public are to be observers, not participants, consumers of ideology as well as products. Eduardo Galeano writes that "the majority must resign itself to the consumption of fantasy. Illusions of wealth are sold to the poor, illusions of freedom to the oppressed, dreams of victory to the defeated and of power to the weak." Nothing less will do.

<P>The problem of indoctrination is a bit different for those expected to take part in serious decision-making and control: the business, state, and cultural managers, and articulate sectors generally. They must internalize the values of the system and share the necessary illusions that permit it to function in the interests of concentrated power and privilege or at least be cynical enough to pretend that they do, an art that not many can master. But they must also have a certain grasp of the realities of the world, or they will be unable to perform their tasks effectively. The elite media and educational systems must steer a course through these dilemmas, not an easy task, one plagued by internal contradictions. It is intriguing to see how it is faced, but that is beyond the scope of these remarks.

<P>For the home front, a variety of techniques of manufacture of consent are required, geared to the intended audience and its ranking on the scale of significance. For those at the lowest rank, and for the insignificant peoples abroad, another device is available, what a leading turn-of-the-century American sociologist, Franklin Henry Giddings, called "consent without consent": "if in later years, [the colonized] see and admit that the disputed relation was for the highest interest, it may be reasonably held that authority has been imposed with the consent of the governed," as when a parent disciplines an uncomprehending child. Giddings was referring to the "misguided creatures" that we were reluctantly slaughtering in the Philippines, for their own good. But the lesson holds more generally.

<P>As noted, the Bolshevik overtones are apparent throughout. The systems have crucial differences, but also striking similarities. Lippmann's "specialized class" and Bernays' "intelligent minority," which are to manage the public and their affairs according to liberal democratic theory, correspond to the Leninist vanguard of revolutionary intellectuals. The "manufacture of consent" advocated by Lippmann, Bernays, Niebuhr, Lasswell and others is the Agitprop of their Leninist counterparts. Following a script outlined by Bakunin over a century ago, the secular priesthood in both of the major systems of hierarchy and coercion regard the masses as stupid and incompetent, a bewildered herd who must be driven to a better world -- one that we, the intelligent minority, will construct for them, either taking state power ourselves in the Leninist model, or serving the owners and managers of the state capitalist systems if it is impossible to exploit popular revolution to capture the commanding heights.

<P>Much as Bakunin had predicted long before, the Leninist "Red bureaucracy" moved at once to dismantle organs of popular control, particularly, any institutional structures that might provide working people with some influence over their affairs as producers or citizens.

<P>Not surprisingly, the immediate destruction of the incipient socialist tendencies that arose during the ferment of popular struggle in 1917 has been depicted by the world's two great propaganda systems as a victory for socialism. For the Bolsheviks, the goal of the farce was to extract what advantage they could from the moral prestige of socialism; for the West, the purpose was to defame socialism and entrench the system of ownership and management control over all aspects of economic, political, and social life. The collapse of the Leninist system cannot properly be called a victory for socialism, any more than the collapse of Hitler and Mussolini could be described in these terms; but as in those earlier cases, it does eliminate a barrier to the realization of the libertarian socialist ideals of the popular movements that were crushed in Russia in 1917, Germany shortly after, Spain in 1936, and elsewhere, often with the Leninist vanguard leading the way in taming the rascal multitude with their libertarian socialist and radical democratic aspirations.  


<H3>Short of Force</H3>

<P>Hume posed his paradox for both despotic and more free societies. The latter case is by far the more important. As the social world becomes more free and diverse, the task of inducing submission becomes more complex and the problem of unraveling the mechanisms of indoctrination, more challenging. But intellectual interest aside, the case of free societies has greater significance for us, because here we are talking about ourselves and can act upon what we learn. It is for just this reason that the dominant culture will always seek to externalize human concerns, directing them to the inadequacies and abuses of others. When U.S. plans go awry in some corner of the Third World, we devote our attention to the defects and special problems of these cultures and their social disorders -- not our own. Fame, fortune, and respect await those who reveal the crimes of official enemies: those who undertake the vastly more important task of raising a mirror to their own societies can expect quite different treatment. George Orwell is famous for <CITE>Animal Farm</CITE> and <CITE>1984,</CITE> which focus on the official enemy. Had he addressed the more interesting and significant question of thought control in relatively free and democratic societies, it would not have been appreciated, and instead of wide acclaim, he would have faced silent dismissal or obloquy. Let us nevertheless turn to the more important and unacceptable questions.

<P>Keeping to governments that are more free and popular, why do the governed submit when force is on their side? First, we have to look at a prior question: to what extent is force on the side of the governed? Here some care is necessary. Societies are considered free and democratic insofar as the power of the state to coerce is limited. The United States is unusual in this respect: Perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, the citizen is free from state coercion, at least, the citizen who is relatively privileged and of the right color, a substantial part of the population.

<P>But it is a mere truism that the state represents only one segment of the nexus of power. Control over investment, production, commerce, finance, conditions of work, and other crucial aspects of social policy lies in private hands. Unwillingness to adapt to this structure of authority and domination carries costs, ranging from state force to the costs of privation and struggle; even an individual of independent mind can hardly fail to compare these to the benefits, however meager, that accrue to submission. Meaningful choices are thus narrowly limited. Similar factors limit the range of ideas and opinion in obvious ways. Articulate expression is shaped by the same private powers that control the economy. It is largely dominated by major corporations that sell audiences to advertisers and naturally reflect the interests of the owners and their market. The ability to articulate and communicate one's views, concerns, and interests -- or even to discover them -- is thus narrowly constrained as well.

<P>Denial of these truisms about effective power is at the heart of the structure of necessary illusion. Thus, a media critic, reviewing a book on the press in the <CITE>New York Times,</CITE> refers without argument to the "traditional Jeffersonian role" of the press "as counterbalance to government power." The phrase encapsulates three crucial assumptions, one historical, one descriptive, one ideological. The historical claim is that Jefferson was a committed advocate of freedom of the press, which is false. The second is that the press in fact functions as a counterbalance to government rather than as a faithful servant, presented here as doctrine, thus evading any need to face the massive array of detailed documentation that refutes this dogma. The ideological principle is that Jeffersonian libertarianism (considered abstractly, apart from its realization in practice) would demand that the press be a counterbalance to government power. That is incorrect. The libertarian conception is that the press should be independent, hence a counterbalance to centralized power of any form. In Jefferson's day, the powers that loomed large were the state, the church, and feudal structures. Shortly after, new forms of centralized power emerged in the world of corporate capitalism. A Jeffersonian would hold, then, that the press should be a counterbalance to state or corporate power, and critically to the state-corporate nexus. But to raise this point carries us into forbidden ground.

<P>Apart from the general constraints on choice and articulate opinion inherent in the concentration of private power, it also set narrow limits on the actions of government. The United States has again been unusual in this respect among the industrial democracies, though convergence toward the U.S. pattern is evident elsewhere. The United States is near the limit in its safeguards for freedom from state coercion, and, also in the poverty of its political life. There is essentially one political party, the business party, with two factions. Shifting coalitions of investors account for a large part of political history. Unions, or other popular organizations that might offer a way for the general public to play some role in influencing programs and policy choices, scarcely function apart from the narrowest realm. The ideological system is bounded by the consensus of the privileged. Elections are largely a ritual form. In congressional elections, virtually all incumbents are returned to office, a reflection of the vacuity of the political system and the choices it offers. There is scarcely a pretense that substantive issues are at stake in the presidential campaigns.  Articulated programs are hardly more than a device to garner votes, and candidates adjust their messages to their audiences as public relations tacticians advise. Political commentators ponder such questions as whether Reagan will remember his lines, or whether Mondale looks too gloomy, or whether Dukakis can duck the slime flung at him by George Bush's speech writers. In the 1984 elections, the two political factions virtually exchanged traditional policies, the Republicans presenting themselves as the party of Keynesian growth and state intervention in the economy, the Democrats as the advocates of fiscal conservatism; few even noticed. Half the population does not bother to push the buttons, and those who take the trouble often consciously vote against their own interest.

<P>The public is granted an opportunity to ratify decisions made elsewhere, in accord with the prescriptions of Lippmann and other democratic theorists. It may select among personalities put forth in a game of symbolic politics that only the most naive take very seriously. When they do, they are mocked by sophisticates. Criticism of President Bush's call for "revenue enhancement" after having won the election by the firm and eloquent promise not to raise taxes is a "political cheap shot," Harvard political scientist and media specialist Marty Linsky comments under the heading "Campaign pledges -- made to be broken." When Bush won the election by leading the public in the "read my lips -- no new taxes" chant, he was merely expressing his "world view," making "a statement of his hopes." Those who thought he was promising no new taxes do not understand that "elections and governing are different ball games, played with different objectives and rules." "The purpose of elections is to win," Linsky correctly observes, expressing the cynicism of the sophisticated; and "the purpose of governing is to do the best for the country," he adds, parroting the necessary illusions that respectability demands.

<P>Even when issues arise in the political system, the concentration of effective power limits the threat. The question is largely academic in the United States because of the subordination of the political and ideological system to business interests, but in democracies to the south, where conflicting ideas and approaches reach the political arena, the situation is different. As is again familiar, government policies that private power finds unwelcome will lead to capital flight, disinvestment, and social decline until business confidence is restored with the abandonment of the threat to privilege; these facts of life exert a decisive influence on the political system (with military force in reserve if matters get out of hand, supported or applied by the North American enforcer). To put the basic point crassly, unless the rich and powerful are satisfied, everyone will suffer, because they control the basic social levers, determining what will be produced and consumed, and what crumbs will filter down to their subjects. For the homeless in the streets, then, the primary objective is to ensure that the rich live happily in their mansions. This crucial factor, along with simple control over resources, severely limits the force on the side of the governed and diminishes Hume's paradox in a well-functioning capitalist democracy in which the general public is scattered and isolated.

<P>Understanding of these basic conditions -- tacit or explicit -- has long served as a guide for policy. Once popular organizations are dispersed or crushed and decision-making power is firmly in the hands of owners and managers, democratic forms are quite acceptable, even preferable as a device of legitimation of elite rule in a business-run "democracy." The pattern was followed by U.S. planners in reconstructing the industrial societies after World War II, and is standard in the Third World, though assuring stability of the desired kind is far more difficult there, except by state terror. Once a functioning social order is firmly established, an individual who must find a (relatively isolated) place within it in order to survive will tend to think its thoughts, adopt its assumptions about the inevitability of certain forms of authority, and in general, adapt to its ends. The costs of an alternative path or a challenge to power are high, the resources are lacking, and the prospects limited. These factors operate in slave and feudal societies -- where their efficacy has duly impressed counterinsurgency theorists. In free societies, they manifest themselves in other ways. If their power to shape behavior begins to erode, other means must be sought to tame the rascal multitude.

<P>When force is on the side of the masters, they may rely on relatively crude means of manufacture of consent and need not overly concern themselves with the minds of the herd. Nevertheless, even a violent terror state faces Hume's problem. The modalities of state terrorism that the United States has devised for its clients have commonly included at least a gesture towards "winning hearts and minds," though experts warn against undue sentimentality on this score, arguing that "all the dilemmas are practical and as neutral in an ethical sense as the laws of physics." Nazi Germany shared these concerns, as Albert Speer discusses in his autobiography, and the same is true of Stalinist Russia. Discussing this case, Alexander Gerschenkron observes that "Whatever the strength of the army and the ubiquitousness of the secret police which such a government may have at its disposal, it would be naive to believe that those instruments of physical oppression can suffice. Such a government can maintain itself in power only if it succeeds in making people believe that it performs an important social function which could not be discharged in its absence. Industrialization provided such a function for the Soviet government..., [which] did what no government relying on the consent of the governed could have done... But, paradoxical as it may sound, these policies at the same time have secured some broad acquiescence on the part of the people. If all the forces of the population can be kept engaged in the processes of industrialization and if this industrialization can be justified by the promise of happiness and abundance for future generations and -- much more importantly -- by the menace of military aggression from beyond the borders, the dictatorial government will find its power broadly unchallenged."

<P>The thesis gains support from the rapid collapse of the Soviet system when its incapacity to move to a more advanced stage of industrial and technological development became evident.  


<H3>The Pragmatic Criterion</H3>

<P>It is important to be aware of the profound commitment of Western opinion to the repression of freedom and democracy, by violence if necessary. To understand our own cultural world, we must recognize that advocacy of terror is clear, explicit, and principled, across the political spectrum. It is superfluous to invoke the thoughts of Jeane Kirkpatrick, George Will, and the like. But little changes as we move to "the establishment left," to borrow the term used by <CITE>Foreign Policy</CITE> editor Charles William Maynes in an ode to the American crusade "to spread the cause of democracy."

<P>Consider political commentator Michael Kinsley, who represents "the left" in mainstream commentary and television debate. When the State Department publicly confirmed U.S. support for terrorist attacks on agricultural cooperatives in Nicaragua, Kinsley wrote that we should not be too quick to condemn this official policy. Such international terrorist operations doubtless cause "vast civilian suffering," he conceded. But if they succeed "to undermine morale and confidence in the government," then they may be "perfectly legitimate." The policy is "sensible" if "cost-benefit analysis" shows that "the amount of blood and misery that will be poured in" yields "democracy," in the conventional sense already discussed.

<P>As a spokesperson for the establishment left, Kinsley insists that terror must meet the pragmatic criterion; violence should not be employed for its own sake, merely because we find it amusing. This more humane conception would readily be accepted by Saddam Hussein, Abu Nidal, and the Hizbollah kidnappers, who, presumably, also consider terror pointless unless it is of value for their ends. These facts help us situate enlightened Western opinion on the international spectrum.

<P>Such reasoned discussion of the justification for terror is not at all unusual, which is why it elicits no reaction in respectable circles just as there is no word of comment among its left-liberal contributors and readers when the <CITE>New Republic,</CITE> long considered the beacon of American liberalism, advocates military aid to "Latin-style fascists...regardless of how many are murdered" because "there are higher American priorities than Salvadoran human rights."

<P>Appreciation of the "salutary efficacy" of terror, to borrow John Quincy Adams's phrase, has been a standard feature of enlightened Western thought. It provides the basic framework for the propaganda campaign concerning international terrorism in the 1980s. Naturally, terrorism directed against us and our friends is bitterly denounced as a reversion to barbarism. But far more extreme terrorism that we and our agents conduct is considered constructive, or at worst insignificant, if it meets the pragmatic criterion. Even the vast campaign of international terrorism launched against Cuba by the Kennedy administration, far exceeding anything attributed to official enemies, does not exist in respected academic discourse or the mainstream media. In his standard and much respected scholarly study of international terrorism, Walter Laqueur depicts Cuba as a sponsor of the crime with innuendos but scarcely a pretense of evidence, while the campaign of international terrorism <I>against</I> Cuba merits literally not a word; in fact, Cuba is classed among those societies "free from terror."

<P>The guiding principle is clear and straightforward: <I>their</I> terror is terror, and the flimsiest evidence suffices to denounce it and to exact retribution upon civilian bystanders who happen to be in the way; <I>our</I> terror, even if far more extreme, is merely statecraft, and therefore does not enter into the discussion of the plague of the modern age. The practice is understandable on the principles already discussed.

<P>Huge massacres are treated by much the same criteria: <I>theirs</I> are crimes, <I>ours</I> statecraft or understandable error. In a study of U.S. power and ideology a decade ago, Edward Herman and I reviewed numerous examples of two kinds of atrocities, "benign and constructive bloodbaths" that are acceptable or even advantageous to dominant interests, and "nefarious blood-baths" perpetrated by official enemies. The reaction follows the same pattern as the treatment of terrorism. The former are ignored, denied, or sometimes even welcomed; the latter elicit great outrage and often large-scale deceit and fabrication, if the available evidence is felt to be inadequate for doctrinal requirements.

<P>Such devices as mass starvation have always been considered entirely legitimate, if they meet the pragmatic criterion. As director of the humanitarian program providing food to starving Europeans after World War II, Herbert Hoover advised President Wilson that he was "maintaining a thin line of food" to guarantee the rule of anti-Bolshevik elements. In response to rumors of "a serious outbreak on May Day" in Austria, Hoover issued a public warning that any such action would jeopardize the city's sparse food supply. Food was withheld from Hungary under the Communist Bela Kun government, with a promise that it would be supplied if he were removed in favor of a government acceptable to the U.S. The economic blockade, along with Rumanian military pressure, forced Kun to relinquish power and flee to Moscow. Backed by French and British forces, the Rumanian military joined with Hungarian counter-revolutionaries to administer a dose of White terror and install a right-wing dictatorship under Admiral Horthy, who collaborated with Hitler in the next stage of slaying the Bolshevik beast. The threat of starvation was also used to buy the critical Italian elections of 1948 and to help impose the rule of U.S. clients in Nicaragua in l990, among other noteworthy examples.

<P>A review of the debate over Central America during the past decade reveals the decisive role of the pragmatic criterion. Guatemala was never an issue, because mass slaughter and repression appeared to be effective. Early on, the Church was something of a problem, but, as Kenneth Freed comments in the <CITE>Los Angeles Times,</CITE> when "14 priests and hundreds of church workers were killed in a military campaign to destroy church support for social gains such as higher wages and an end to the exploitation of Indians," the church was intimidated and "virtually fell silent." "The physical intimidation ceased," the pragmatic criterion having been satisfied. Terror increased again as the U.S. nurtured what it likes to call "democracy." "The victims," a European diplomat observes, "are almost always people whose views or activities are aimed at helping others to free themselves of restraints placed by those who hold political or economic power," such as "a doctor who tries to improve the health of babies" and is therefore "seen as attacking the established order." The security forces of the "fledgling democracy," and the death squads associated with them, appeared to have the situation reasonably well in hand, so there was no reason for undue concern in the United States, and there has been virtually none.

<P>Throughout this grim decade of savagery and oppression, liberal humanists have presented themselves as critical of the terror states maintained by U.S. violence in Central America. But that is only a facade, as we see from the demand, virtually unanimous in respectable circles, that Nicaragua must be restored to "the Central American mode" of the death squad regimes, and that the U.S. and its murderous clients must impose the "regional standards" of El Salvador and Guatemala on the errant Sandinistas.

<P>Returning to Hume's principles of government, it is clear that they must be refined. True, when force is lacking and the standard penalties do not suffice, it is necessary to resort to the manufacture of consent. The populations of the Western democracies -- or at least, those in a position to defend themselves -- are off limits. Others are legitimate objects of repression, and in the Third World, large-scale terror is appropriate, though the liberal conscience adds the qualification that it must be efficacious. The statesman, as distinct from the ideological fanatic, will understand that the means of violence should be employed in a measured and considered way, just sufficient to achieve the desired ends.  


<H3>The Range of Means</H3>

<P>The pragmatic criterion dictates that violence is in order only when the rascal multitude cannot be controlled in other ways. Often, there are other ways. Another RAND corporation counterinsurgency specialist was impressed by "the relative docility of poorer peasants and the firm authority of landlords in the more `feudal' areas... [where] the landlord can exercise considerable influence over his tenant's behavior and readily discourage conduct inconsistent with his own interests." It is only when the docility is shaken, perhaps by meddlesome priests, that firmer measures are required.

<P>One option short of outright violence is legal repression. In Costa Rica, the United States was willing to tolerate social democracy. The primary reason for the benign neglect was that labor was suppressed and the rights of investors offered every protection. The founder of Costa Rican democracy, Jose Figueres, was an avid partisan of U.S. corporations and the CIA, and was regarded by the State Department as "the best advertising agency that the United Fruit Company could find in Latin America." But the leading figure of Central American democracy fell out of favor in the 1980s, and had to be censored completely out of the Free Press, because of his critical attitude towards the U.S. war against Nicaragua and Washington's moves to restore Costa Rica as well to the preferred "Central American mode." Even the effusive editorial and lengthy obituary in the <CITE>New York Times</CITE> lauding this "fighter for democracy" when he died in June 1990 were careful to avoid these inconvenient deviations.

<P>In earlier years, when he was better behaved, Figueres recognized that the Costa Rican Communist Party, particularly strong among plantation workers, was posing an unacceptable challenge. He therefore arrested its leaders, declared the party illegal, and repressed its members. The policy was maintained through the 1960s, while efforts to establish any working class party were banned by the state authorities. Figueres explained these actions with candor: it was "a sign of weakness. I admit it, when one is relatively weak before the force of the enemy, it is necessary to have the valor to recognise it." These moves were accepted in the West as consistent with the liberal concept of democracy, and indeed, were virtually a precondition for U.S. toleration of "the Costa Rican exception."

<P>Sometimes, however, legal repression is not enough; the popular enemy is too powerful. The alarm bells are sure to ring if they threaten the control of the political system by the business-landowner elite and military elements properly respectful of U.S. interests. Signs of such deviation call for stronger measures, as in Central America through the past decade. The broader framework was sketched by Father Ignacio Martin-Baro, one of the Jesuit priests assassinated in November 1989 and a noted Salvadoran social psychologist, in a talk he delivered in California on "The Psychological Consequences of Political Terrorism," a few months before he was murdered. He stressed several relevant points. First, the most significant form of terrorism, by a large measure, is state terrorism, that is, "terrorizing the whole population through systematic actions carried out by the forces of the state." Second, such terrorism is an essential part of a "government-imposed socio-political project" designed for the needs of the privileged. To implement it, the whole population must be "terrorized by an internalized fear." Third, the sociopolitical project and the state terrorism that helps implement it are not specific to El Salvador, but are common features of the Third World domains of the United States. The reasons are deeply rooted in Western culture, institutions, and policy planning, and fully in accord with the values of enlightened opinion. But terror is constrained by the pragmatic criterion. Thus, Martin-Baro observes, the "massive campaign of political terrorism" in El Salvador declined when "there was less need for extraordinary events, because people were so terrorized, paralyzed."

<P>In a paper on mass media and public opinion in El Salvador which he was to deliver at an International Congress in December 1989, the month after he was assassinated, Martin-Baro wrote that the U.S. counterinsurgency project "emphasized merely the formal dimensions of democracy," and that the mass media must be understood as a mechanism of "psychological warfare." The small independent journals in El Salvador, mainstream and pro-business but still too undisciplined for the rulers, had been taken care of by the security forces a decade earlier in the usual efficacious manner -- kidnapping, assassination, and physical destruction, events considered here too insignificant even to report. As for public opinion, Martin-Baro's unread paper reports a study showing that among workers, the lower-middle class, and the poor, less than 20 percent feel free to express their opinions in public, a figure that rose to 40 percent for the rich -- another tribute to the salutary efficacy of terror, and another result that "all Americans can be proud of," to borrow George Schultz's words of self-praise for our achievements in El Salvador.

<P>When Antonio Gramsci was imprisoned after the Fascist takeover of Italy, the government summed up its case by saying: "We must stop this brain from functioning for twenty years." Our current favorites leave less to chance: the brains must be stopped from functioning forever, and we agree that their thoughts about such matters as state terrorism had best not be heard.

<P>The results of U.S. military training are evident in abundance in the documentation by human rights groups and the Salvadoran Church. They are graphically described by Rev. Daniel Santiago, a Catholic priest working in El Salvador, in the Jesuit journal <CITE>America.</CITE> He reports the story of a peasant woman, who returned home one day to find her mother, sister, and three children sitting around a table, the decapitated head of each person placed carefully on the table in front of the body, the hands arranged on top "as if each body was stroking its own head." The assassins, from the Salvadoran National Guard, had found it hard to keep the head of an 18-month-old baby in place, so they nailed the hands onto it. A large plastic bowl filled with blood was tastefully displayed in the center of the table.

<P>Rev. Santiago writes that macabre scenes of the kind he recounts are designed by the armed forces for the purpose of intimidation. "People are not just killed by death squads in El Salvador -- they are decapitated and then their heads are placed on pikes and used to dot the landscape. Men are not just disemboweled by the Salvadoran Treasury Police; their severed genitalia are stuffed into their mouths. Salvadoran women are not just raped by the National Guard; their wombs are cut from their bodies and used to cover their faces. It is not enough to kill children; they are dragged over barbed wire until the flesh falls from their bones while parents are forced to watch." "The aesthetics of terror in El Salvador is religious." The intention is to ensure that the individual is totally subordinated to the interests of the Fatherland, which is why the death squads are sometimes called the "Army of National Salvation" by the governing ARENA party, whose members (including President Cristiani) take a blood oath to the "leader-for-life," Roberto d'Aubuisson.

<P>It has been a constant lament of U.S. government officials that the Latin American countries are insufficiently repressive, too open, too committed to civil liberties, unwilling to impose sufficient constraints on travel and dissemination of information, and in general reluctant to adhere to U.S. social and political standards, thus tolerating conditions in which dissidence can flourish and can reach a popular audience.

<P>At home, even tiny groups may be subject to severe repression if their potential outreach is perceived to be too great. During the campaign waged by the national political police against The Black Panthers -- including assassination, instigation of ghetto riots, and a variety of other means -- the FBI estimated the "hard core members" of the targeted organization at only 800, but added ominously that "a recent poll indicates that approximately 25 per cent of the black population has a great respect for the [Black Panther Party], including 43 per cent of blacks under 21 years of age." The repressive agencies of the state proceeded with a campaign of violence and disruption to ensure that the Panthers did not succeed in organizing as a substantial social or political force -- with great success, as the organization was decimated and the remnants proceeded to self-destruct. FBI operations in the same years targeting the entire New Left were motivated by similar concerns. The same internal intelligence document warns that "the movement of rebellious youth known as the `New Left,' involving and influencing a substantial number of college students, is having a serious impact on contemporary society with a potential for serious domestic strife." The New Left has "revolutionary aims" and an "identification with Marxism-Leninism." It has attempted "to infiltrate and radicalize labor," and after failing "to subvert and control the mass media," has established "a large network of underground publications which serve the dual purpose of an internal communication network and an external propaganda organ." It thus poses a threat to "the civilian sector of our society," which must be contained by the state security apparatus.

<P>We can learn a good deal by attention to the range of choices. Keeping just to Latin America, consider the efforts to eliminate the Allende regime in Chile. There were two parallel operations. Track II, the hard line, aimed at a military coup. This was concealed from Ambassador Edward Korry, a Kennedy liberal, whose task was to implement Track I, the soft line; in Korry's words, to "do all within our power to condemn Chile and the Chileans to utmost deprivation and poverty, a policy designed for a long time to come to accelerate the hard features of a Communist society in Chile." The soft line was an extension of the long-term CIA effort to control Chilean democracy. One indication of its level is that in the 1964 election, the CIA spent twice as much per Chilean voter to block Allende as the total spent per voter by both parties in the U.S. elections of the same year. Similarly in the case of Cuba, the Eisenhower administration planned a direct attack while Vice-President Nixon, keeping to the soft line in a secret discussion of June 1960, expressed his concern that according to a CIA briefing, "Cuba's economic situation had not deteriorated significantly since the overthrow of Batista," then urging specific measures to place "greater economic pressure on Cuba."

<P>To take another informative case, in 1949 the CIA identified "two areas of instability" in Latin America: Bolivia and Guatemala. The Eisenhower administration pursued the hard line to overthrow capitalist democracy in Guatemala but chose the soft line with regard to a Bolivian revolution that had the support of the Communist Party and radical tin miners, had led to expropriation, and had even moved towards "criminal agitation of the Indians of the farms and mines" and a pro-peace conference, a right-wing Archbishop warned. The White House concluded that the best plan was to support the least radical elements, expecting that U.S. pressures, including domination of the tin market, would serve to control unwanted developments. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles urged that this would be the best way to contain the "Communist infection in South America." Following standard policy guidelines, the U.S. took control over the Bolivian military, equipping it with modern armaments and sending hundreds of officers to the "school of coups" in Panama and elsewhere. Bolivia was soon subject to U.S. influence and control. By 1953, the National Security Council noted improvement in "the climate for private investment," including "an agreement permitting a private American firm to exploit two petroleum areas."

<P>A military coup took place in 1964. A 1980 coup was carried out with the assistance of Klaus Barbie, who had been sent to Bolivia when he could no longer be protected in France, where he had been working under U.S. control to repress the anti-fascist resistance, as he had done under the Nazis. According to a recent UNICEF study, one out of three Bolivian infants dies in the first year of life, so that Bolivia has the slowest rate of population growth in Latin America along with the highest birth rate. The FAO estimates that the average Bolivian consumes 78 percent of daily minimum calorie and protein requirements and that more than half of Bolivian children suffer from malnutrition. Of the economically active population, 25 percent are unemployed and another 40 percent work in the "informal sector" (e.g., smuggling and drugs). The situation in Guatemala we have already reviewed.

<P>Several points merit attention. First, the consequences of the hard line in Guatemala and the soft line in Bolivia were similar. Second, both policy decisions were successful in their major aim: containing the "Communist virus," the threat of "ultranationalism." Third, both policies are evidently regarded as quite proper, as we can see in the case of Bolivia by the complete lack of interest in what has happened since (apart from possible costs to the U.S. through the drug racket); and with regard to Guatemala, by the successful intervention under Kennedy to block a democratic election, the direct U.S. participation in murderous counterinsurgency campaigns under Lyndon Johnson, the continuing supply of arms to Guatemala through the late 1970s (contrary to illusory claims) and the reliance on our Israeli mercenary state to fill any gaps when congressional restrictions finally took effect, the enthusiastic U.S. support for atrocities that go well beyond even the astonishing Guatemalan norm in the 1980s, and the applause for the "fledgling democracy" that the ruling military now tolerates as a means to extort money from Congress. We may say that these are "messy episodes" and "blundering" (which in fact succeeded in its major aims), but nothing more (Stephen Kinzer). Fourth, the soft line and the hard line were adopted by the same people, at the same time, revealing that the issues are tactical, involving no departure from shared principle. All of this provides insight into the nature of policy, and the political culture in which it is formed.  


<A NAME="anarchism"><H3>The Untamed Rabble</H3></A>

<P>Hume's paradox of government arises only if we suppose that a crucial element of essential human nature is what Bakunin called "an instinct for freedom." It is the failure to act upon this instinct that Hume found surprising. The same failure inspired Rousseau's classic lament that people are born free but are everywhere in chains, seduced by the illusions of the civil society that is created by the rich to guarantee their plunder. Some may adopt this assumption as one of the "natural beliefs" that guide their conduct and their thought. There have been efforts to ground the instinct for freedom in a substantive theory of human nature. They are not without interest, but they surely come nowhere near establishing the case. Like other tenets of common sense, this belief remains a regulative principle that we adopt, or reject, on faith. Which choice we make can have large-scale effects for ourselves and others.

<P>Those who adopt the common sense principle that freedom is our natural right and essential need will agree with Bertrand Russell that anarchism is "the ultimate ideal to which society should approximate." Structures of hierarchy and domination are fundamentally illegitimate. They can be defended only on grounds of contingent need, an argument that rarely stands up to analysis. As Russell went on to observe 70 years ago, "the old bonds of authority" have little intrinsic merit. Reasons are needed for people to abandon their rights, "and the reasons offered are counterfeit reasons, convincing only to those who have a selfish interest in being convinced." "The condition of revolt," he went on, "exists in women towards men, in oppressed nations towards their oppressors, and above all in labour towards capital. It is a state full of danger, as all past history shows, yet also full of hope."

<P>Russell traced the habit of submission in part to coercive educational practices. His views are reminiscent of 17th and 18th century thinkers who held that the mind is not to be filled with knowledge "from without, like a vessel," but "to be kindled and awaked." "The growth of knowledge [resembles] the growth of Fruit; however external causes may in some degree cooperate, it is the internal vigour, and virtue of the tree, that must ripen the juices to their just maturity." Similar conceptions underlie Enlightenment thought on political and intellectual freedom, and on alienated labor, which turns the worker into an instrument for other ends instead of a human being fulfilling inner needs -- a fundamental principle of classical liberal thought, though long forgotten, because of its revolutionary implications. These ideas and values retain their power and their pertinence, though they are very remote from realization, anywhere. As long as this is so, the libertarian revolutions of the 18th century remain far from consummated, a vision for the future.

<P>One might take this natural belief to be confirmed by the fact that despite all efforts to contain them, the rabble continue to fight for their fundamental human rights. And over time, some libertarian ideals have been partially realized or have even become common coin. Many of the outrageous ideas of the 17th century radical democrats, for example, seem tame enough today, though other early insights remain beyond our current moral and intellectual reach.

<P>The struggle for freedom of speech is an interesting case, and a crucial one, since it lies at the heart of a whole array of freedoms and rights. A central question of the modern era is when, if ever, the state may act to interdict the content of communications. As noted earlier, even those regarded as leading libertarians have adopted restrictive and qualified views on this matter. One critical element is seditious libel, the idea that the state can be criminally assaulted by speech, "the hallmark of closed societies throughout the world," legal historian Harry Kalven observes. A society that tolerates laws against seditious libel is not free, whatever its other virtues. In late 17th century England, men were castrated, disemboweled, quartered, and beheaded for the crime. Through the 18th century, there was a general consensus that established authority could be maintained only by silencing subversive discussion, and "any threat, whether real or imagined, to the good reputation of the government" must be barred by force (Leonard Levy). "Private men are not judges of their superiors... [for] This wou'd confound all government," one editor wrote. Truth was no defense: true charges are even more criminal than false ones, because they tend even more to bring authority into disrepute.

<P>Treatment of dissident opinion, incidentally, follows a similar model in our more libertarian era. False and ridiculous charges are no real problem: it is the unconscionable critics who reveal unwanted truths from whom society must be protected.

<P>The doctrine of seditious libel was also upheld in the American colonies. The intolerance of dissent during the revolutionary period is notorious. The leading American libertarian, Thomas Jefferson, agreed that punishment was proper for "a traitor in thought, but not in deed," and authorized internment of political suspects. He and the other Founders agreed that "traitorous or disrespectful words" against the authority of the national state or any of its component states was criminal. "During the Revolution," Leonard Levy observes, "Jefferson, like Washington, the Adamses, and Paine, believed that there could be no toleration for serious differences of political opinion on the issue of independence, no acceptable alternative to complete submission to the patriot cause. Everywhere there was unlimited liberty to praise it, none to criticize it." At the outset of the Revolution, the Continental Congress urged the states to enact legislation to prevent the people from being "deceived and drawn into erroneous opinion." It was not until the Jeffersonians were themselves subjected to repressive measures in the late 1790s that they developed a body of more libertarian thought for self-protection -- reversing course, however, when they gained power themselves.

<P>Until World War I, there was only a slender basis for freedom of speech in the United States, and it was not until 1964 that the law of seditious libel was struck down by the Supreme Court. In 1969, the Court finally protected speech apart from "incitement to imminent lawless action." Two centuries after the revolution, the Court at last adopted the position that had been advocated in 1776 by Jeremy Bentham, who argued that a free government must permit "malcontents" to "communicate their sentiments, concert their plans, and practice every mode of opposition short of actual revolt, before the executive power can be legally justified in disturbing them." The 1969 Supreme Court decision formulated a libertarian standard which, I believe, is unique in the world. In Canada, for example, people are still imprisoned for promulgating "false news," recognized as a crime in 1275 to protect the King.

<P>In Europe, the situation is still more primitive. France is a striking case, because of the dramatic contrast between the self-congratulatory rhetoric and repressive practice so common as to pass unnoticed. England has only limited protection for freedom of speech, and even tolerates such a disgrace as a law of blasphemy. The reaction to the Salman Rushdie affair, most dramatically on the part of self-styled "conservatives," was particularly noteworthy. Rushdie was charged with seditious libel and blasphemy in the courts, but the High Court ruled that the law of blasphemy extended only to Christianity, not Islam, and that only verbal attack "against Her Majesty or Her Majesty's Government or some other institution of the state" counts as seditious libel. Thus the Court upheld a fundamental doctrine of the Ayatollah Khomeini, Stalin, Goebbels, and other opponents of freedom, while recognizing that English law protects only domestic power from criticism. Doubtless many would agree with Conor Cruise O'Brien, who, when Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in Ireland, amended the Broadcasting Authority Act to permit the Authority to refuse to broadcast any matter that, in the judgment of the minister, "would tend to undermine the authority of the state."

<P>We should also bear in mind that the right to freedom of speech in the United States was not established by the First Amendment to the Constitution, but only through dedicated efforts over a long period by the labor movement, the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s, and other popular forces. James Madison pointed out that a "parchment barrier" will never suffice to prevent tyranny. Rights are not established by words, but won and sustained by struggle.

<P>It is also worth recalling that victories for freedom of speech are often won in defense of the most depraved and horrendous views. The 1969 Supreme Court decision was in defense of the Ku Klux Klan from prosecution after a meeting with hooded figures, guns, and a burning cross, calling for "burning the nigger" and "sending the Jews back to Israel." With regard to freedom of expression there are basically two positions: you defend it vigorously for views you hate, or you reject it in favor of Stalinist/Fascist standards.

<P>Whether the instinct for freedom is real or not, we do not know. If it is, history teaches that it can be dulled, but has yet to be killed. The courage and dedication of people struggling for freedom, their willingness to confront extreme state terror and violence, is often remarkable. There has been a slow growth of consciousness over many years and goals have been achieved that were considered utopian or scarcely contemplated in earlier eras. An inveterate optimist can point to this record and express the hope that with a new decade, and soon a new century, humanity may be able to overcome some of its social maladies; others might draw a different lesson from recent history. It is hard to see rational grounds for affirming one or the other perspective. As in the case of many of the natural beliefs that guide our lives, we can do no better than to choose according to our intuition and hopes.

<P>The consequences of such a choice are not obscure. By denying the instinct for freedom, we will only prove that humans are a lethal mutation, an evolutionary dead end: by nurturing it, if it is real, we may find ways to deal with dreadful human tragedies and problems that are awesome in scale.
