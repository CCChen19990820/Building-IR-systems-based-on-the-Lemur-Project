DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q. Thank you, Your Honor. Good morning.



A. Hi.



Q. You used to work at Mezzaluna?



A. I did.



Q. Did you work there on June 12, 1994?



A. Yes, I did.



Q. What was your position there at the time?



A. I was bartender and I was the Sunday manager.



Q. Did Ron Goldman work there?



A. He did.



Q. And did he work there on June 12, 1994?



A. Yes, he did.



Q. What day was that?



A. That was a Sunday.



Q. And what was Ron's job that evening?



A. Ron was a waiter.



Q. Okay. And were there other people working there, as well?



A. There were, yes.



Q. Including Stewart Tanner?



A. Stewart was bartending.



Q. Now, at some point -- well, let me ask you this first: You

recognized Ronald Goldman from working with him, right?



A. Yes.



Q. Can you see the photograph there?



A. Yes.



Q. Looking at Exhibit 19, that is a picture of Mr. Goldman?



A. Yes, it is.



Q. Okay. Did you recognize, as of June 12, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson?



A. Yes.



Q. And looking at Exhibit 21, is that a picture of her?



A. That's her.



Q. Now, had Nicole come into the restaurant from time to time?



A. Yeah, she did.



Q. Okay. Did she come in on the evening of June 12?



A. Yes.



Q. And did she come in with a party of people?



A. She came in with several adults and several children.



Q. Okay. About how big was the party?



A. I'd say 10 or 11.



Q. And by the way, did Ron wait on the Brown party that night?



A. No, he didn't.



Q. You recognize the defendant, Mr. Simpson?



A. Yes, I do.



Q. Do you see him in the courtroom here?



A. Yes.



Q. Was he with the Brown party that evening --



A. No.



Q. -- at Mezzaluna?



A. He wasn't.



Q. Let me ask you to give us a little geography first.



Maybe he'll just put it up here. Hopefully, it won't fall down

(indicating to map of Bundy area).



Before I ask you what happened that evening, I'd like you to point to

the map which I've marked as Exhibit 18. And I wonder if you could

tell us on this map where Mezzaluna is located.



A. Should I just get up?



MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. May she approach, Your Honor?



THE COURT: Yes.



A. Mezzaluna, right here at this corner of San Vicente and Gorham.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Right around here?



A. Yes.



Q. And where did Ron Goldman live, if you know?



A. He lived on Gorham Avenue between Mezzaluna and the VA Hospital.



Q. Would that be on this side?



A. Yes.



Q. So here's Mezzaluna, and Mr. Goldman lived on Gorham, in this area,

right?



A. Yeah.



Q. Little farther?



A. Somewhere on that street, yeah.



Q. Did you know if he he drove or walked to work?



A. He walked.



Q. You understood he lived a short distance from the restaurant?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. That evening, now, do you recall what time Nicole's party

left the restaurant?



A. What time they left?



Q. Yeah.



A. They left between 8:30 and 9:00.



Q. And that's the last time you saw Nicole Brown Simpson, when she

left the restaurant around 8:30 to 9:00?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. And sometime after Nicole left, did Ron Goldman punch out?



A. Yeah, he did.



Q. Do you know what time Ron Goldman punched out?



A. He punched out about 9:30.



Q. After Ron Goldman punched out, did he leave the restaurant right

away, or did he stick around for a time?



A. No, he stayed for a while.



Q. Do you know what he did?



A. He got something to drink and he sat down with a couple of other

employees for a few minutes.



Q. Okay. Did you then get a phone call?



A. Yes.



Q. And who called you?



A. It was a woman who said she had lost her glasses. When she

explained to me where she had been sitting, I realized it was one of

the people in Nicole's party.



Q. And who do you now understand that person to have been?



A. It was Judith Brown.



Q. Nicole's mother?



A. Nicole's mother.



Q. About what time did you get that phone call from Judy Brown?



A. It was about 9:30, 9:35.



MR. PETROCELLI: Can you focus that a little bit better?



Guess not. (Indicating to monitor.)



No, up here.



Can you see that? It's very out of focus to me. Is it right --



JUROR: Yeah.



MR. LEONARD: Stipulate that it's 9:37.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Let me just show you Exhibit 26. And you will

see a phone call at 9:37 p.m. to 477-8667.



A. Yes.



Q. Is that the number of Mezzaluna?



A. Yes, it is.



Q. So, Judy Brown called you at 9:37 p.m, right?



A. Yes.



Q. And you spoke for about two minutes, right?



A. Yes.



Q. And what did she tell you?



A. She had told me that she had lost some glasses. She told me she had

been in a large party, and I recognized her voice because of her

accent. So I knew the area that she was talking about.



I looked around the area where their table was, where they were

seated. When I didn't find the glasses there, I went outside to look,

because I had seen them get out of the car, and I found the glasses

outside.



Q. After you found the glasses outside, what did you then do?



A. I went back inside and let her know that I had found her glasses.



Q. And what did she then say?



A. Well, I had asked her when she would be picking them up. And she

told me she lived too far away.



So I told her that I would put them in an envelope and I would put

them in the bar area -- we had a lost-and-found area behind the bar.



She told me that she was going to have her daughter pick them up, so I

put her daughter's name on it.



Q. And that was the end of the call?



A. Yes.



Q. Let me show you an envelope and some glasses, please. A photo of

this has been marked as Exhibit 25.



(The instrument herein described was marked for identification as

Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 25.)



Q. Putting the envelope and glasses in front of you, do you recognize

the glasses?



A. Yes.



Q. Are those the glasses that you picked up at the curb, outside of

the restaurant?



A. Yeah.



Q. And those are the glasses that you put in the envelope?



A. Yes.



Q. And is that the envelope that you put the glasses in?



A. Yes.



Q. And is that your handwriting?



A. That's my handwriting.



Q. What does it say?



A. It says "Prescription glasses. Nicole Simpson will pick up Monday."



Q. Okay.



And what did you do with this envelope after you put the glasses in

and wrote down Nicole's name?



A. I put it behind the bar in our lost-and-found area.



Q. What happened next?



A. I got another phone call, and it was Nicole. She had -- she

identified herself by saying that her mother had just talked to me.



And I asked her when she would be picking up the glasses. And then I

believe I asked her when.



She wanted to know if Ron was still working. And I put her on hold and

told Ron, You have a phone call.



She actually said, is Ron still working, or is Ron still there. So I

put her on hold and told Ron he had a phone call.



Q. And then did Ron take the call?



A. Yes, he did.



Q. When Ron took the call, where did he come from?



A. I believe he was sitting at the table by the front door.



Q. Talking to some other people?



A. Yes.



Q. Did you see Ron speak on the phone to Nicole?



A. I saw him speak, yes.



Q. Okay. You could tell he was speaking?



A. Yes.



Q. Could you overhear the conversation?



A. No, I couldn't hear what he was saying.



Q. And after, you saw Ron hang up the phone?



A. Oh, yes, I did.



Q. And after he hung up the phone, what did you then see Ron do?



A. He hung around for a couple of minutes talking to people, and then

he asked me to to give him the glasses.



Q. So he left the phone near you, went and talked to some folks again,

and then came back?



A. Yes.



Q. And then asked for the glasses?



A. Yeah. He told me he would drop them off -- he was going to drop

them off at Nicole's, and asked me if I would give them to him.



Q. And did he tell you what his plans were?



A. He said he was going to drop them off at her house on his way to

Baja Cantina.



Q. Did he tell you why he was going to Baja Cantina?



A. Yeah. He was meeting a couple guys from work at Baja after work.



Q. What happened next, after Ron said -- You gave Ron the glasses?



A. I did.



Q. And then what happened?



A. He said good-bye to some people, and then he left.



Q. What time was it, Ms. Crawford, when Ron left?



A. He left at ten minutes to 10:00.



Q. And how do you know that?



A. Well, my friend was at Mezzaluna, and he wanted to rent a video.

And I thought I would call and see if the video store was open,

because it was Sunday, and I thought maybe they would close early. And

I specifically remember looking at my watch right after -- you know,

right after Ron left. And I thought I would call, because I thought

they might be closing at 10:00, so I called. And that he's how I

remember.



Q. Okay. So you saw Ron leave the restaurant at ten to 10:00?



A. Yeah.



Q. And you saw him go out the door?



A. I saw him go out the door.



Q. Toward which street?



A. He left on the side doors that exit out to Gorham.



Q. And that's where he lived, right, on Gorham?



A. He lived on Gorham, yeah.



Q. What was Ron wearing when he left?



A. He had on his dark pants and white shirt. He had taken off some of

his uniform, the vest.



Q. The dark pants and white shirt are part of the waiter's uniform

that Ron wore that evening?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. And when Ron left the restaurant at ten to 10:00 in his

waiter's uniform, is that the last time you saw him alive?



A. Yeah, that's the last time.



MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you very much.



CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:



Q. Good morning.



A. Hi.



Q. My name is Dan Leonard. I represent O.J. Simpson. You were asked

about --



MR. LEONARD: May I approach, Your Honor?



THE COURT: Yes.



BY MR. LEONARD:



Q. You were asked about these glasses by Mr. Petrocelli. Is there

anything different about the glasses from when you picked them up OFF

the street?



A. When I found them, they were in fine shape. Nothing -- they hadn't

been run over; they were -- no lenses knocked out of the glasses.



Q. Okay. If you examine this bag, you'll see that one of the lenses is

missing; is that right?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. When you picked them up, both lenses were there?



A. Yes, both were there.



Q. And when you gave them to Mr. Goldman both lenses were there?



A. Yes.



Q. Now, you said that you understood that Mr. Goldman walked to and

from work; is that right?



A. Normally, yes.



Q. He didn't own a car?



A. Not that I knew of, no.



Q. And he didn't have a driver's license?



A. Oh, I don't know about that.



Q. You were interviewed how many times by the police? Do you remember?



A. I don't remember. I know once, for sure. Maybe two times. I can't

remember.



Q. Do you remember getting a phone call from a police officer on the

13th?



A. On the 13th?



Q. Which would have been Monday, the day after the murders. Do you

remember that?



A. Well, I initially called first because what I had seen on TV. And

then they got my information and had someone call me back.



Q. And then, a couple days later, you were interviewed by a couple of

detectives. Do you remember that?



A. Yes.



Q. Detective Tippin, a Detective --



A. Yeah.



Q. -- Detective Carr?



A. Yes.



Q. You saw Ron on the phone, talking to Nicole?



A. Yes.

You didn't see him writing anything down?



A. No, I didn't.



Q. Okay. Thank you.



THE COURT: Anything further?



MR. PETROCELLI: No.



THE COURT: Thank you. You're excused.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, for the next witness -- it will be Stewart

Tanner -- the defense and the plaintiff stipulated to the admission of

Exhibit 23, which is a photograph of a pager at the crime scene at

Bundy, and Exhibit 24, which is a photograph of the actual pager, not

A. Yes.



Q. Did you also see Nicole Brown Simpson there that evening?



A. Yes, sir.



Q. Do you remember what she was wearing?



A. A black jacket and a black dress.



Q. Okay. She was in a party of a number of people; is that right?



A. Yes, sir.



Q. Now, did you make plans with Mr. Goldman that evening to do

something after work?



A. Yes, sir. We were supposed to go out.



Q. Where were you supposed to go?



A. We were going to go to a restaurant and bar in Marina Del Rey.



Q. Who else was going to go besides Ron and you?



A. Another waiter that worked there, that didn't work there that

evening, by the name of John Valente.



Q. Was it definite that you were going to go?



A. Not, not really. I mean, you know, they said, hey, why don't we,

after work go by and hang out. And that's the way it was left.



Q. Did Ron talk to you before he left the restaurant?



A. Yes, sir.



Q. And what did he tell you?



A. You call me; I'll call you, you know, because I was getting off,

obviously, later than he was. And that was it.



Q. Were you planning to drive in one car or separately?



A. Separately.



Q. Okay. And Ron was going to meet Mr. Valente at --



A. Yeah.



Q. -- At the Baja?



A. All three of us were going to meet up there, possibly separate

times because -- just the timing of it all.



Q. So you, Ron, and John Valente were going to drive there separately

at different times?



A. Right.



Q. Okay. Did Ron tell you that he had a date with Nicole Brown Simpson

that night?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for hearsay.



THE COURT: Sustained.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Did Ron indicate anything to you about his

plans to see Nicole Brown Simpson?



MR. LEONARD: Same objection, Your Honor.



THE COURT: You may answer yes or no.



THE WITNESS: Can you repeat the question?



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Did Ron tell you that he had any plans to see

Nicole Brown Simpson?



A. No.



MR. LEONARD: Same objection, Your Honor.



THE COURT: Same ruling. You can answer yes or no.



MR. PETROCELLI: State of mind of the subsequent conduct under 1250,

Your Honor. That's the only reason I was offering it.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) In any event, did you see Ron and Nicole Brown

Simpson in the restaurant that evening, interacting at all?



A. Not at all.



Q. Okay. Let me show you a picture of what's previously been marked as

Exhibits 23 and 24.



MR. PETROCELLI: Could you put those on, Steve.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Do you recognize that? (Referring to screen.)



A. Yes, sir.



MR. PETROCELLI: Can you show the next one.



(Monitor is displayed.)



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) And you recognize that?



A. Yes, sir.



Q. Okay. Now, did Ron Goldman have a pager?



A. Yes, sir, he did.



Q. Okay. And pagers that we just showed you that have been marked as

Exhibits 23 and 24 --



A. Yes, sir.



Q. -- you recognize those as Mr. Goldman's pager?



A. Yes, sir.



Q. Okay. Did you actually go to Baja Cantina that night?



A. No. I got off work later than I thought and was tired, and just

went home and went to bed.



Q. What time did you get off of work?



A. Sometime after 11:30 I think.



Q. The next morning when you got up, did you call Ron or page him on

his beeper?



A. Ron and I worked on Mondays and he was never late to work. And I

came in and he wasn't there, so I called his answer machine and left a

message. And then I paged him after that.



MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.



CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:



Q. Morning, Mr. Tanner. My name is Dan Leonard. I represent O.J.

Simpson.



A. Morning.



Q. Did you have a beeper?



A. Do I have one?



Q. Did you have one then?



A. Not at that time, no.



Q. You were planning to meet with Mr. Goldman and another gentleman at

the restaurant over in --



A. Marina Del Rey.



Q. Okay. And what time were you planning to meet?



A. There was no specific time.



Q. Mr. Goldman didn't have an automobile; is that right?



A. I'm sorry?



Q. He didn't own a car?



A. No, sir.



Q. Okay. You were interviewed by the police on a single occasion; is

that right?



A. I was interviewed, well, Monday, the 13th.



Q. Um-hum.



A. That would be correct. And in the early evening, one time only,

yes.



Q. And how long did that interview last?



A. Possibly in the neighborhood of 15, 20 minutes.



Q. Do you remember now, as you sit here today, everything that the

police asked you in that interview?



A. No, I couldn't say that. I mean, it was three years ago.



MR. LEONARD: If I may approach, Your Honor.



THE COURT: Go ahead.



MR. LEONARD: This is on page 368.



MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.



Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Let me show you a document and ask you if -- I'd

like you to read the document -- ask you if that refreshes your

recollection as to what you were asked by the police.



(Witness reviews document.)



A. Okay.



Q. Does that refresh your memory, sir?



A. Yes, sir.



Q. Is it fair to say that the police asked you about Ron Goldman's

activities and whereabouts on the night of the 12th?



A. Correct.



Q. And that's all they asked you about, correct?



A. Yeah. I mean, they could have asked me more. I don't know if

there's more to this report or not.



Q. That's all you remember, right?



A. Right.



MR. LEONARD: Thank you.



THE COURT: Mr. Petrocelli, I'm going to reconsider my ruling on the

question with regards to whether or not Goldman stated what his intent

was under 1251. It's not available. I think this comes within the

state of mind and statement of intent exception. Go ahead and ask.



MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you, Your Honor.



REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q. Did Mr. Goldman tell you that he was going to see Nicole Brown

Simpson for a date?



A. No.



Q. To your knowledge, were they dating?



MR. LEONARD: Objection. That calls for hearsay, speculation.



THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.



THE WITNESS: No, he wasn't dating Nicole at all.



MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.



MR. LEONARD: No further questions.



THE COURT: Thank you. You're excused.



(Witness excused.)



MR. PETROCELLI: Our next witness, Your Honor, who is Robert Heidstra,

the plaintiffs and defense have stipulated to admission of Exhibit 28,

which is a photo of Nicole's dog, Kato and Exhibit 191, which is a

photo of the Bronco parked at 360 North Rockingham. And we would call

Q. Okay. Now -- and you've been taking that route of June 12, 1994 for

how many years?



A. Oh, about ten years, I guess.



Q. In the course of taking that route a couple of times a day over ten

years, did you come to know any of the other neighbors and dogs along

the way?



A. Yes, some people I knew. We knew each other.



Q. And before June 12, 1994, had you ever walked by with your dogs,

875 South Bundy?



A. Yes, past that building.



Q. Okay. Do you now know that building to be the building where Nicole

Brown Simpson lived?



A. Yes.



Q. Had you ever seen a dog on her property behind the gate?



A. Yes, behind the gate, a big Akita.



Q. A big Akita?



A. Yeah.



Q. And would you walk your dogs past the gate area?



A. Mostly on the opposite side of the street.



Q. Opposite side of the street?



A. Yeah. Most of the time, yeah.



Q. When you would walk your dogs past her condominium on the opposite

side of the street, you could see her Akita?



A. Yeah, behind a gate.



Q. Did you ever hear it barking?



A. Yes.



Q. Were you familiar with the barking of that Akita?



A. Yes.



Q. Is it a small dog or big dog?



A. Big dog.



Q. Now, let me show you a photograph.



MR. PETROCELLI: Steve, can you put up -- I guess it's Exhibit 28. Take

this down for a minute.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) On the TV screen, we have a picture; it's been

marked as Exhibit 2. Do you recognize what is in that picture?



A. That's the dog, the Akita that was behind the gate.



Q. You have to talk in the microphone.



A. Yeah. That was the Akita that was behind the gate, looks like.



Q. That's Nicole's Akita?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. By the way, is the Akita bigger than the two dogs you're

walking?



A. Oh, yes. Yes.



Q. At some point in evening on June 12, did you take your dogs out for

a walk?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. You got home from work around what time?



A. 6 o'clock.



Q. Do you do a walk at 6 o'clock?



A. Immediately when I come home, I go walk the dogs.



Q. And then you have dinner?



A. Yeah.



Q. And then before you go to bed at night, do you walk the dogs again?



A. Yes; 10 o'clock.



Q. And on the night of June 12, 1994, you walked your dogs around that

time?



A. No. I know it was later.



Q. What time was it when you left your house to walk the dogs?



A. 15 after 10:00.



Q. Okay. Any particular reason why you left a little later that night?



A. Yeah. I was reading my paper and looking at TV, and I forgot about

the time. And one of my dogs gave me a signal, and I looked at my

watch, and it was 10:15. And I said, hey, we better go now. So I know

exactly it was 10:15.



Q. So you took -- you took the two dogs and you left your apartment.

And in which direction did you go?



A. I went to Westgate.



Q. Again?



A. Right.



Q. Two buildings up to Westgate, turned left?



A. Turned north.



Q. That's north?



A. Yeah, north on Westgate, and then west on Gorham.



Q. West on Gorham. Made a left, right?



A. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.



Q. What happened? Anything in particular happen when you got down near

the Bundy area?



A. Well, when I was walking down Gorham. It was a very quiet Sunday

night, no sounds whatsoever, until I reached the corner of Bundy and

Gorham. I was almost in Bundy when all of a sudden, the Akita start to

barking like crazy, and he stayed barking, like he was confused and

panicky.



Q. Now, the Akita that you started to hear barking like crazy, did you

recognize that to be Nicole's?



A. Yeah, immediately. There was no other dog like that in that stretch

of the street.



Q. Okay.



A. I recognize the barking.



Q. When you heard the dog barking like crazy, what did you do?



A. I was immediately alerted, because it's a big dog and I didn't want

any fight with any dogs or something. He sounded like he was on the

street. So I stopped immediately and turned around, and said we can't

go further.



Q. When you heard the dog barking?



A. Yeah.



Q. Nicole's Akita barking, you -- from the sounds of the barking, you

thought it was in the street and not behind the gate?



A. Yeah. It sounds like so close, so close.



Q. Okay. And you did not want to go by the house?



A. No, because I didn't want to risk for my dogs to have a fight or

anything.



Q. Well, can you point to the map where you were when you stopped

hearing the dog in the street. Now, bear in mind, this is an alleyway.

Do you recognize that alleyway? Where were you when you stopped, when

you heard the dog barking like crazy?



A. Just beyond the alley there.



Q. Just past the alley?



A. Almost in the curve.



Q. Can you see any parts of Nicole's condominium where you were?



A. No.



Q. You were on the other side of the street from her condominium --



A. Yes.



Q. -- on the sidewalk, with the two dogs?



A. Yeah.



Q. And how loud was the barking? Can you describe it?



A. My God, it was --



Q. Why don't you use the microphone?



A. Okay.



Q. I'm sorry to make you keep getting up.



A. That's okay. It was very loud barking. I never heard a barking like

this before. It was very strange. Very strange.



Q. Continuous?



A. Oh, nonstop. Nonstop.



Q. What did you then decide to do?



A. I turned around, and I didn't want to go back the same way I came

from Gorham. Next to me was that alley, and go uphill there. And I

said let's go in the alley. We have a shortcut. I go back to Dorothy.



Q. The idea, instead of going down Bundy and up around --



A. Yeah.



Q. -- you were going to cut down this alleyway?



A. To go back to Dorothy.



Q. To get home?



A. Yeah.



Q. And what time was it, sir, when you heard the dog barking like

crazy, and then made the decision to cut across the alleyway?



A. This must have been around 10:30, 10:35.



Q. Between 10:30 and 10:35?



A. Yeah, something like that.



Q. Now, you then began to walk across the alleyway, right?



A. Yeah.



Q. Approximately how long is that alley?



A. Oh, I think it was only a few minutes, two, three minutes.



Q. Do you know what the distance is?



A. 150 meters something like that.



Q. 150 meters?



A. Yes.



Q. So normally, it would take you two or three minutes to cross the

alley?



A. Yeah.



Q. Now, did anything happen when you started to walk across the alley?



A. Well, the dog kept barking and barking and barking. And I went into

the alley slowly. And I reach the point where I was going opposite

Nicole's condo, and I stood there listening to the dog. My God, is

this going on still?



Q. Let me stop you right there.



A. Okay.



Q. Just so we don't get too far ahead of ourselves here.



(Indicating to map.)



Okay. When you're walking across the alley here, you got to a point

opposite Nicole's condominium?



A. Exactly opposite. Exactly opposite.



Q. Okay. Now, in terms of the terrain here, when you were on this

alley, are you elevated from Bundy?



A. Oh, yes. It's much more elevated.



Q. You're up high?



A. Up high.



Q. Can you actually see Nicole's condominium from the alley when

you're standing --



A. Well, you can see the roof, the tiles, the red tiles; that I could

see, yes.



Q. All you can make out is a red-tile roof?



A. Yeah, the red tiles.



Q. And this alleyway which is like a driveway, that cuts across here?



A. Yeah. It's bigger than a driveway; it's a little wider.



Q. And are there homes here between the -- what we're calling the

alleyway and Bundy?



A. Yes, small houses.



Q. Okay.



A. Small houses.



Q. Was there a dog at the house where you stopped?



A. Exactly. A little black dog.



Q. So let me get the picture. You're walking across; there's a house

here with a dog. You continue to hear the Akita, right?



A. Oh, yeah, constantly.



Q. And then at the some point, you stop and you think -- at that

point, you think you are opposite Nicole's condominium?



A. Yeah.



Q. And you're with your two dogs, right?



A. Two dogs.



Q. Then what happened?



A. Then I stood there, I would say, for a minute, listened to these

two dogs. The little black dog started to barking also. Two dogs were

barking then.



Q. The two dogs being the little black dog that the property owner

had?



A. Yeah. It started to bark, too.



Q. At the same time, you're still hearing the Akita?



A. Yeah. Nonstop.



Q. When you say it's barking like crazy, what kind of barking is it?



A. It's confused, panicking, but not attacking. Not at all, that he

was growling or something, not at all. He was just confused

completely.



Q. And now --



MR. BAKER: Move to strike. No foundation.



THE COURT: You want to lay a little dog foundation?



(Laughter.)



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You've heard lots of dogs barking in lots of

different ways over the years?



A. Oh, yeah.



MR. BAKER: Leading and suggestive. Can I get a ruling, please.



THE COURT: Overruled.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Are you familiar with different kinds of sounds

of barking?



A. Yeah. Small dogs have different barking than a big dog. It's a deep

barking.



Q. Can you distinguish between -- well, tell us what you meant when

you said it was not an attack barking.



MR. BAKER: Again, no foundation.



THE COURT: The man's had a dog for 26 years. He can distinguish it. Go

ahead.



MR. PETROCELLI:



Q. In your own words.



A. It was panicking, high barking, high barking, and constantly

nonstop barking. Very strange. Very strange.



Q. What would you consider an attack kind of barking?



A. Its a growl, g-r-r-r-r-r (witness making growl sounds), something

like that.



Q. Did you hear that kind of barking?



A. No, not at all.



Q. You didn't hear growling?



A. No, no, no, no.



Q. Now, when you were sitting there, or standing there with your dogs

at the alley opposite Nicole's condominium and you heard the dogs

barking, did you then hear anything else?



A. Because -- yeah, but it was around about a minute there, all of a

sudden, when the dogs keep barking, I heard the first voice, a clear

voice, saying, "Hey, hey, hey," for three, four times.



Q. Can you tell if it was a male or female?



A. It was a male; no doubt about it.



Q. Younger or older male?



A. Sounded clear, young voice.



Q. And what did you then hear next?



A. Immediately after "hey, hey, hey, hey," I heard another voice

talking very fast, a deeper voice, very fast, sounded like an argument

or something like that.



Q. Was that a male or female?



A. Male.



Q. Okay. Older or younger than the first voice?



MR. BAKER: Foundation.



THE WITNESS: Sounds --



THE COURT: Overruled. Go ahead.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You may answer.



A. Older.



Q. Okay. And you said it was deeper than the first voice?



A. Yeah. Pretty deep voice.



Q. Now, could you hear any actual words being spoken by the second,

deeper voice?



A. No, because the dogs were barking so loud, it was impossible to

hear.



Q. Okay. After you heard the second deeper voice, did you hear

anything else?



A. Yeah. It didn't last no more than 15 seconds, I would say. Then I

heard a gate slamming, bang, and then immediately, my mind said, "Boy

that's the gate for the Akita behind the gate from Nicole's house.

Sounded -- because I was just opposite Nicole's condo, so I felt it

must be the gate to Nicole's condo.



Q. And in your opinion, that's where those noises were coming from?



A. Oh yes, no doubt.



Q. How many times did you hear a gate slam?



A. Just once. Yeah.



Q. Now, what did you do after you heard all this?



A. Well, then I continued out of the alley. And if these two guys have

an argument, it's nothing more than that. It's like an argument. I

said, well, that's it.



Q. And then at some point, you got to the end of this alley where it

intersects Dorothy; is that right?



A. Yeah.



Q. And you previously testified that you began to go into that alley

at 10:30 to 10:35?



A. Yeah, 10:35.



Q. How many minutes after that were you at the other end of the alley?



A. Was a little more, because I stood there and listened to the dog

regularly -- It's about two minutes, and we say about three, four,

five minutes, something like that. Five minutes at the --



Q. Five minutes, at the outside?



A. Yeah, at the outside.



Q. You said three, four, five minutes; is that your testimony?



A. Yeah. Four minutes or something.



Q. Okay. And when you got to the other end of the alley, what then

happened?



A. Okay. Out of the alley. And the dogs were still barking nonstop; it

never stopped. And then I went east on Dorothy, back to my -- the

direction of my apartment.



Q. You started to walk up the hill?



A. Yeah. Just --



Q. Is this a hill, by the way? This is Dorothy?



A. No. It goes a little -- it goes a little up, but not very much.



Q. So when you got to this alley here, you made a left on Dorothy,

right?



A. Yeah.



Q. And then you walked a little bit up?



A. Yeah, about two houses. Two houses. About two, three, and listened

to the noise.



Q. Let me stop you there. There's a tree?



A. There's a big oak tree or something.



Q. And you stopped under the tree?



A. I was under the tree, yes.



Q. And on which side of the street, this side?



A. Yeah.



Q. I guess that's what, north?



A. It's north, I guess.



Q. So, on the north side of the street. And you're under the oak tree

--



A. Right.



Q. -- and with your dogs, right?



A. Um-hum.



Q. And then what did you see or what happened?



A. So I stood there for a minute, I would say, a minute and a half or

something, looking back to Dorothy and where the noise came from. And

I -- there's a streetlight on the corner of Bundy and --



Q. Dorothy?



A. -- and Dorothy, yes.



Q. So you're about -- you want to point where you are?



A. Yeah.



Q. Where you're standing?



A. I was standing there, about there.



Q. Let the record reflect, I guess you're pointing a little west of

the alleyway, on the north side of Dorothy.



A. Yeah.



Q. And where is the street lamp that you were referring to?



A. The middle of this street here.



Q. Okay. Up on Bundy and Dorothy?



A. And Dorothy.



Q. What direction are you facing, are you looking?



A. West.



Q. Are you looking at the intersection?



A. Yeah, I'm looking at the intersection.



Q. What was the lighting like?



A. It was pretty good lighting.



Q. I think I misspoke. I think it's east of the alley, not west of the

alley. You were standing where the oak tree is. I'm not very good on

directions.



A. Yeah, east. You're right. Sorry.



Q. What did you see when you were looking down at the intersection

where the street lamp was?



A. I was looking down there. From nowhere, all of a sudden, then I saw

from the west side of Dorothy, from Nicole's side, from out of dark,

came in the light a white, jeep-like car.



Q. Okay.



A. It came all of a sudden out of the dark. I could see it right away

in the streetlight.



Q. And then what did you see the car do?



A. The car came out of the -- like I said, from the dark into the

light, and stopped on the right side of Dorothy for one moment. And it

sped right away, south on Bundy.



Q. Did it make a turn?



A. No, it went south. It made a right turn.



Q. A right turn?



A. Yes, south.



Q. So the car is on Dorothy, comes up to the intersection, and you

pick it up where, right before it gets to the intersection?



A. Yeah. Just, I could see it coming into the intersection, yeah.



Q. And then it makes a right-hand turn?



A. Yeah. Sped away fast.



Q. And sped away fast in the direction --



A. South.



Q. South?



A. South, yes.



Q. Were you able to get a good look at the car?



A. It was a wide kind of jeep, with tinted glasses.



Q. Tinted windows?



A. Tinted windows. Yes, sir.



MR. PETROCELLI: Can we put up the next photo, which has been marked as

191.



(The instrument herein described was marked for identification as

Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 191)



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Did the car that you saw that evening look like

the one in the photo?



A. It was -- it resembled a car like this, yes. For sure, I couldn't

say exactly this car, but it resembled the size of the car.



Q. And the color?



A. White.



Q. That was a little basic kind of vehicle, was it?



A. Yeah. It was a big car, big vehicle like this.



Q. Okay. Now, did the truck or the car have its headlights on?



A. That, I don't recall. I can't recall that at all.



Q. Did you have any opinion as you saw the vehicle speed away, whether

it appeared like the person was in a hurry?



A. Oh yes. It was -- must have been in a hurry; it sped away fast.



Q. Can you tell us about what time it was when you made that

observation?



A. It must have been around 10:40, 10:45, in between. No more than

10:45, for sure. It would be a little before, maybe.



Q. Little before 10:45?



A. Yeah.



Q. But in the area of 10:40 to 10:45?



A. Exactly, yeah.



Q. Now, you said you were on the other side of the alley at 10:30,

10:35, right?



A. Yeah.



Q. And it took you five minutes to cross on this particular night,

right?



A. Yeah. It took longer because I was standing there, listening to the

dog up at Nicole's condo.



Q. That would put you on the other side of the alleyway at around

10:35 to 10:40; is that right?



A. Yeah.



MR. BAKER: Your Honor, leading; asked and answered.



THE COURT: It is leading.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) And again, after you got to the other side of

the alley, about how many minutes went by before you believe you saw

the car?



MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.



THE COURT: Overruled.



A. When I came out of alley, you mean?



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Yeah.



A. A minute, minute and a half, or something like that.



Q. You were standing under that oak tree?



A. Yeah.



Q. Okay. By the way, what do you do for a living?



A. I'm a car detailer. Somebody wants a used car --



Q. And after you saw the car speed away, what did you then do?



A. I proceeded to go home to my apartment, very slowly, with my older

dog, who was very slow. His rear legs are pretty bad. We very slowly

go back.



Q. And then you did what?



A. I went, while the dogs were barking, never stopped, I went on to my

apartment, and stopped one time and looked back again on Bundy. I

couldn't figure out what it was because I've been living so long and

it never happened before. And I came in front of my apartment and

listened to the commotion of these two dogs. And I stood there for

three minutes or something, listening to the Akita barking like crazy.

And then all of a sudden, he slowed down a few barks. So I said, well,

he's calming down now. So I said, well, it's over, the whole

commotion. So I slowly went into my apartment with the two dogs.



Q. And about what time was it when you got inside?



A. Well, must have been around 11:00, because my TV was on and they

were announcing that the news was coming up.



Q. By the way, I think you said this -- just to make sure -- the

streetlight at the intersection of Dorothy and Bundy --



A. Yeah.



Q. -- Was that light on or off?



A. It was on, for sure. I could never have seen the car.



Q. Okay. Sir, after the -- you testified in the criminal trial, right?



A. I did, yes.



Q. Okay. And the verdict came down sometime in October of last year?



A. Yeah.



Q. Okay. Now, since that time, have you made plans to write a book

about your observations?



A. Yes, after the verdict.



Q. Okay. Have you sold your book?



A. No. No takers.



Q. Nobody interested?



A. Guess not.



Q. You have not received any money at all?



A. Not at all, not one penny.



Q. And basically, the book that you are writing is about the

observations you made?



A. Right. Exactly.



Q. And did you write any of that book before you testified at the

trial?



A. No, never.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Thank you.



THE COURT: Okay. Ten-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk

about the case; don't form or express any opinion.



(Recess.)



CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:



Q. Morning, Mr. Heidstra.



A. Good morning.



Q. My name is Bob Baker; I represent Mr. O.J. Simpson.



When you were put on in the criminal trial, you were put on by Johnnie

Cochran?



A. Yes.



Q. Mr. Darden didn't put you on the stand?



MR. BREWER: Objection. Relevance.



THE COURT: Sustained.



Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In terms of your movements the night of the 12th --

pardon me -- as I understand it, you went out -- came out of your

house here on Dorothy?



A. Right.



Q. Walked east?



A. Yes.



Q. Walked north of Westgate?



A. Westgate, yes.



Q. Left on Gorham, and came down to the area on Bundy and you were on

the inside, or east side of Bundy when you turned, correct?



A. Yeah.



Q. You hadn't crossed over to the west side of Bundy?



A. No. No. No, I was on the east side.



Q. You walked down to an area past the alley where Bundy makes that

curve, correct?



A. Yeah.



Q. That's when you heard the Akita barking?



A. Yeah, very loud.



Q. Okay. And that's about 10:30, right?



A. 10:30, 10:35, about that time.



Q. 10:30, 10:35?



A. Um-hum.



Q. And then you don't see the dog out in the street, do you?



A. No. It sounded very close, yeah, but I didn't see it, no.



Q. And when you heard that dog, you thought maybe that dog could be of

some threat to your dog, so you back -- actually backtrack, went back

up, and then start coming down the alley, right?



A. Right.



Q. Okay. Now, when you got to the -- walked down the alleyway, you got

parallel -- what you believe is parallel to 875 South Bundy --



A. Yes.



Q. -- in the alleyway, and there was another little dog there, and it

started barking?



A. Yes, started barking. Yes.



Q. You couldn't see, obviously, through that house, that the little

dog was out over to Nicole's?



A. No. You can see only tile roofs.



Q. You can stand here and look up and see the tile roofs?



A. Yes.



Q. And the Akita's still barking loudly?



A. Oh, yeah, nonstop.



Q. And the other dog is a smaller dog, and it's barking at you as

well?



A. Yeah.



Q. And were your two dogs barking at all?



A. No, I was very lucky. They didn't bark once.



Q. Now, when you got to the place where you were parallel to Nicole's,

that was at 10:40, right?



A. No, no, no. It was before that.



Q. Let me read what you said in the criminal trial, please, at 36504,

lines 5 through 19. And I'll omit the objections. See if I can refresh

your recollection a little bit, Mr. Heidstra.



"Q.So now that we're clear, Mr. Heidstra, is there any doubt in your

mind that you were in that alley, and was walking parallel to Bundy,

on the night of June 12, 1994?



"A.No doubt. I'd never forget that.



"Q.Any doubt in your mind that when you stopped behind that house, it

was approximately 10:40, any doubt?



"A.No. No doubt about it."



Now, does that refresh your recollection?



A. I don't recall that at all, sir. Unfortunately, it's too late.



Q. Well, I take it a year or so ago, your memory may have been just a

little clearer about the event after the passage of time.



A. Repeat it again.



Q. Be happy to. All I'm saying is that our memories are usually better

closer to the event.



A. Sure. Sure, I understand.



Q. Okay. And then when you came -- you proceeded down the alley, south

down the alley, turn left, and were under the *oak tree and looked

back down to the west on Dorothy, that was about 10:45, wasn't it?



A. Yeah, around 10:45. A little before that, I would say.



Q. Let me read to you what you said in your trial testimony, just to

see if I can refresh your recollection.



MR. PETROCELLI: What page?



Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Again at 36504.



"Q.Is there any doubt in your mind that when you were on the street on

Dorothy and you looked back, before you saw this car turning right to

go south on Bundy, it was around 10:45 in the evening?



"A.10 -- Around 10:45, yes.



"Q.Any doubt in your mind about that?



"A.Oh no. It must have been in that time exactly when I came to the

alley."



Okay?



A. Exactly. Around that time. Around that time.



Q. I understand, sir. So we're looking at an approximation, give or

take a couple minutes, of you standing here (indicating to map), a

little east of the alley?



A. Right.



Q. And are you on the north or south side of the street?



A. North.



Q. North. And you look back to see a vehicle turn right on -- on

Bundy, and head south toward Wilshire Boulevard, correct?



A. Right.



Q. And you had just seen a couple cars go past, had you not?



A. Yeah. Up and down Bundy, two cars.



Q. Now, you were a car detailer at Salinger's, next door to Mr.

Simpson's house, for some years, were you not?



A. I am still, yes.



Q. You are still. If you were going -- you obviously have some

knowledge of how to get up to where Mr. Simpson lives, do you not?



A. Yes.



Q. Now, would you agree that if you were in a hurry and wanted to get

to Mr. Simpson's house and come out of the alley behind -- between

Gretna Green and Bundy, you would turn right, or essentially turn the

car around, and head north?



A. No. It could be south, too.



Q. Well, the quickest way to get there isn't to come down the alley,

go east on Dorothy, and then south on Bundy, is it?



MR. PETROCELLI: Argumentative.



MR. KELLY: Objection.



THE WITNESS: No.



THE COURT: Sustained.



MR. PETROCELLI: It's outside the scope, too.



Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Is the quickest way to get up to the Salinger's

house -- strike it.



Did you ever -- if you're leaving your house on Dorothy, did you ever

go south on Bundy to get to the Salinger house, next door to O.J.?



A. No, but it can be done. If you go south, you go to Mayfield, the

next street, and go to Gretna Green. There's no traffic lights or

nothing there.



Q. I see.



A. Because north, you get traffic lights all *over the place.



Q. Actually, you don't get any traffic lights if you head up Gretna

Green and go straight to San Vicente, do you, sir?



A. There's no traffic lights, no stop signs.



MR. BAKER: Thanks. I don't have anything further.



THE COURT: Anything else?



MR. PETROCELLI: No, Your Honor.



THE COURT: Thank you. You may step down.



MR. BAKER: I'm sorry; I have one more area. I apologize. I have one

more area. Sorry.



Q. (BY MR. BAKER) When you talked -- being a car detailer, you

recognize cars pretty well, do you not?



A. Yeah.



Q. When you talked to the police, you indicated that the car you say

was a Blazer, like a Chevy Blazer. In fact, you pointed to a Chevy

Blazer, didn't you?



A. Yeah. They interviewed me and they pointed to me what kind of --

size of car I saw. And there was a Blazer in my building. They said,

was it that kind of size? Of course, I said yes.



Q. You said it was shaped similarly to a Chevy Blazer parked in his

carport?



A. This size of the car.



Q. Now, one other thing: You testified, did you not, that the color

was light or white?



A. No. It was definitely white, sir.



Q. Let me just get your -- 36324.



MR. PETROCELLI: One second, Mr. Baker. Okay.



MR. BAKER: (Reading:)



"Q.Did that car make a turn, or



did it go up Dorothy, or what did it do?



"A.It made a turn.



"Q.Which direction did it go?



"A.A right turn and went south.



"Q.Are you sure that vehicle went south?



"A.Sure, sure.



"Q.Would that be towards Wilshire Boulevard?



"A.Towards Wilshire Boulevard.



"Q.What color was the color?



"A.Very light color, white or light.



"Q.White or light?



"A.It was white or something."



Does that refresh your recollection, sir?



A. It was white, definitely white.



Q. So it wasn't white or light?



A. No, it was white.



Q. It wasn't white or light?



A. It was white.



Q. Thank you.



MR. BAKER: Nothing further.



REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q. When the police spoke to you, did they point to a car in the

carport?



A. Yes.



Q. And what was that car?



A. That was a Blazer car.



Q. Was there a Bronco there?



A. No.



Q. When Mr. Baker was asking you about Gretna Green and Bundy, did you

say that Gretna Green did not have lights as you go north?



A. That they don't have, only stop signs.



Q. And Bundy does have lights?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. Thank you.



RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:



Q. One more thing, Mr.Heidstra: When you come out of the alley between

Bundy and Gretna Green, you can just turn right if you were in a hurry

to go to Mr. Simpson's house, and turn right another hundred feet and

go north on Gretna Green, and not hit any stoplights, wouldn't you?



A. Repeat again --



Q. I apologize.



A. -- please.



Q. It's an important question, and I'm sorry.



All I'm saying is, if you're tying to head to Mr. Simpson's house --

let's just say the



Salinger house next door -- and you come south, if a car -- vehicle

was -- happened to be parked in a southerly direction, that alley back

there is big enough you can make a U-turn and go north, could you not?



A. Which alley you mean?



Q. The alley between Bundy and Gretna Green. I'm sorry.



A. Down between? You mean behind Nicole's --



Q. Yeah.



A. -- condo?



Q. Sure. That's a big enough alley to simply make a U-turn if you

want, isn't it?



A. You can make a U-turn.



Q. So you could head north on --



A. To Gretna Green, you mean?



Q. Well, you could go north to Montana if you wanted?



A. Yeah.



Q. And you could obviously take a right turn, take another right turn,

and access and go north on Gretna Green?



A. Yes.



Q. Sure, thanks. Nothing further.



REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q. When you saw the car, the white car approach the intersection, you

did not see it coming from the alleyway, did you?



A. No.



Q. And so you did not know where that car was parked?



A. No. It's dark.



Q. Okay. That car could have been parked on Dorothy?



A. Sure. Yes. Yes.



Q. Thank you.



MR. BAKER: It's not that I need the last word.



(Laughter.)



Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That car could have been coming straight down

Dorothy. You don't know where it came from, do you?



A. No. It came out of the dark, complete dark behind there.



Q. It could have come out of Gretna Green, Dorothy, anyplace?



A. Yes.



MR. BAKER: Thanks. Nothing further.



THE COURT: Is that all?



MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, sir.



THE COURT: You may step down. Thank you.



THE WITNESS: Thank you.



(Witness excused.)



THE COURT: Next witness.



MR. PETROCELLI: Louis Karpf, Your Honor.



LOUIS KARPF, called as a witness on behalf of the plaintiff Goldman,

was duly sworn and testified as follows:



THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in

the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole

truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?



THE WITNESS: I do.



THE BAILIFF: Please be seated.



THE CLERK: And, sir, if you would, please state and spell your name

for the record.



THE WITNESS: It's Louis Karpf, L-O-U-I-S, K-A-R-P-F.



DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q. Morning, Mr. Karpf?



A. Morning.



Q. Where do you live?



A. I live at 873 South Bundy Drive.



Q. Referring you to Exhibit 18 --



MR. PETROCELLI: Can you all see here, by the way?



JURORS: (Nod affirmatively.)



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) This is Nicole's



condominium. You see that?



A. Yes, I do.



Q. Where in relation to Nicole's condominium do you live?



A. It would be the first building north.



Q. So it would be here?



A. Right.



Q. That's correct?



A. Okay.



Q. On the evening of June 12, did you -- where were you around 10

o'clock or so?



A. I was just getting back from a trip to San Jose, arriving at LAX.



Q. Okay. And about what time did you get home?



A. I arrived home between 10:45, 10:40 to 10:45.



Q. Now, when you arrived at home, what did you first do, pull into

your garage?



A. Yes; I pulled in the garage next to the alley. So...



Q. And after you pulled into your garage, what did you then do?



A. I entered the house, put my bag down, and proceeded to the mailbox.



Q. So you didn't do anything in between?



A. No, I didn't.



Q. And so you go in the garage, go in the house. Did you go out a

door?



A. Yes. I go out the front door.



Q. Okay. And you went out to the mailbox, right?



A. That is correct.



Q. Where is it located?



A. It's about 10 feet from the curb on Bundy.



Q. So that would be north of Nicole's condominium, right?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. Tell us what happened when you went out to your mailbox.



A. As I was approaching the mailbox, a large and agitated dog was in

the street, and it was coming towards me, barking profusely. So I

stepped back inside the gate, close to the mailbox, and waited for him

to leave.



Q. So you were getting to the mailbox, but never quite got there

because you saw the dog?



A. That's correct.



MR. PETROCELLI: And Steve, could you put up that picture? It's Exhibit

28.



(The instrument herein described was marked for identification as

Plaintiff's Exhibit Nos. 28.)



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Let me show you a photograph of a dog that has

been marked as Exhibit 28. Is that the dog that you saw?



A. Yes, it is.



Q. Okay. And what did you do after you saw the dog?



A. I stepped back inside my gate, which is a locked gate, and waited

for him to leave.



Q. And the dog was where, again?



A. It was in the middle of the street, coming towards me.



Q. And you were a little frightened?



A. Yes, I was.



Q. What was the dog doing, other than walking towards you?



A. Barking very loudly.



Q. You then retreated?



A. I then retreated inside the gate.



Q. And what happened next?



A. As soon as he started to walk up the street, which is north, I

proceeded to get my mail, and then I went back in the house.



Q. Okay. What time was it when you saw the dog in the middle of the

street, when you were going out to the mailbox?



A. I would say the latest would be about 10:50.



Q. Could it have been earlier than 10:50?



MR. BAKER: Speculation. Leading.



THE COURT: Overruled.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) What was the approximate time range?



A. I'd say between 10:45 and 10:50.



Q. And after you saw the dog, you went inside. And did you hear or see

the dog after that?



A. No, I didn't.



MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Thank you.



THE COURT: Cross.



CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:



Q. Morning, Mr. Karpf; my name is Dan Leonard. I represent O.J.

Simpson.



A. Morning.



Q. Now, you were interviewed by the police shortly after the incident

right -- shortly after you witnessed what you did, right?



A. Probably about one or two weeks later.



Q. And you recall when you were interviewed by the police, you told

them that you arrived home at approximately 10:50 to 11 o'clock. Do

you remember that?



A. I remember seeing what I wrote from what they said.



Q. Okay. That was your best recollection at the time?



A. At the time, right.



Q. And you would agree that your recollection back then is better than

it is now; would you agree with that?



A. I would say yes for today, yes.



Q. Okay. Because I thought you said today that you arrived home

between 10:40 and 10:45. I just wanted to make sure.



A. Somewhere around 10:45, plus or minus five minutes either way. I

wasn't trying to be exact.



Q. But when you were talking to the police, you were trying to give

them the most precise time you could, right?



A. Yes, I was.



Q. And again, you told them sometime between 10:50 and 11 o'clock?



A. That's what I said, yes.



Q. Okay. Now, the way you were able to reconstruct the time at that

time that you arrived home for the police is, you were thinking back

to the time that your plane arrived?



A. I knew what time the plane arrived at and approximately how long it

takes me to get home.



Q. You thought the plane arrived at 10 o'clock?



A. About 10 o'clock.



Q. Have you ever -- have you ever tried to determine, after the fact,

exactly what time that -- exactly what time that plane arrived by

calling up the airline?



A. No, I didn't.



Q. Again, what you did is, you thought about it, and you determined

that you had arrived at 10:00, and then you added on all the time

after that, things you had to do: For instance, getting off the plane?



A. Right.



Q. Walking to the parking lot?



A. That's correct.



Q. Finding your car, right?



A. Correct.



Q. Paying for the ticket?



A. Um-hum.



Q. Or paying the parking, right, and then driving home, right?



A. Yes. Um-hum.



Q. And you figured out it was between 10:50 and 11 o'clock, based on

that reconstruction?



A. Yes.



Q. Would it surprise you to learn that the flight arrived at 10:12,

sir?



A. Yes, it would.



Q. If the flight arrived at 10:12, would you agree with me that your

time line gets moved up about ten minutes or so?



A. If it arrived at 10:12, I possibly would not have gotten home

before 10:50.



Q. In fact, would it be much closer to 11:00 or after?



A. No.



Q. Excuse me. It certainly wouldn't -- Excuse me?



A. No.



Q. It certainly wouldn't be 10:40 to 10:45, would it?



A. I would say 10:50, if it got at the gate 10:12. I've done this many

times.



Q. Thank you very much. When you first arrived, you didn't hear, when

you first walked out to the front of your property, you didn't hear

the dog barking, right?



A. Not from the garage, no.



Q. Thank you.



A. Um-hum.



THE COURT: Anything else?



MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, a few more.



REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q. What airline were you flying?



A. Southwest.



Q. When you got off the plane, how far was the parking lot?



A. Maybe 100 feet from in front of the terminal.



Q. So, right next to the gate?



A. Yes.



Q. Hundred feet, you said?



A. Probably.



Q. And then you got in your car. And did you make any stops along the

way?



A. No, I didn't.



Q. You went up what, the 405?



A. 405 to Wilshire, west to Bundy, then north.



Q. Okay. Little past 10 o'clock on Sunday night. Any traffic?



A. Very little.



Q. Okay. Thank you.



RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:



Q. Just so I can clarify, this was Southwest Flight 852 that you were

on; is that right? 862. Excuse me.



A. I have no idea.



Q. It was a flight out of San Jose?



A. That is correct.



Q. Thank you.



MR. PETROCELLI: Nothing further.



THE COURT: You're excused. I thank you.



MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, our next two witnesses are not here yet.

They were supposed to be here by noon. We didn't think we'd be going

this quickly. I have to apologize to the court for that.



MR. BAKER: Your Honor, we better approach on this, because I think

this is a significant witness.



THE COURT: Jurors, you're excused until 1:30. Do you have other

witnesses before them?



MR. BAKER: I don't know. It's not my case.



THE COURT: Well, is there any reason I shouldn't excuse them until

1:30?



MR. BAKER: I don't know. If they're not coming until 1:30, of course,

they should be excused.



MR. PETROCELLI: They were supposed to be here by noon.



THE COURT: At noon. Well, we don't plan to be in session at noon.



MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. I thought we would put them on at 1:30. I

thought these four witnesses would take until 12:00.



THE COURT: 1:30. Leave your notebooks on the seat. The bailiff is

going to collect them and lock them in the cabinet. They're your

private notes. You are not to take them home; you're not to work on

notes at home. You know why? Because you're only supposed to get your

evidence at trial, and you're not supposed to form or express any

opinions about this case until the case is finally over and you're in

the deliberation room, deliberating. That means you don't go home and

work on the case. Everybody understand that?



JURORS: (Nod affirmatively.) Yes, sir.



THE COURT: Okay.



Also, since we have a few minutes here, let me reiterate what I've

told you before.



You cannot get your evidence from any other source. That means the

only place you're going to get your evidence from is where we're

getting it right now: From the witness stand, from the exhibits that

the parties are offering. And that's the only place. You can't go and

conduct your own research; you can't go do your own detecting. You

can't go to the scene. You can't look at reference books, medical

books or anything like that.



Everything you learn about this case and everything you use to reach

your decision in the case has to be through the trial, and only

through the trial.



Everybody understand that?



JURORS: Yes.



THE COURT: Now, you're going to be going home over the weekend. You've

been going home every night. You're again admonished not to talk to

anyone about this case. Don't talk to your family, close friends or

not-too-close friends. Don't talk to anybody about this case.



Don't form or express any opinions about this case, as I said, until

the case is finally given over to you for your decision.



Now, if we're not in session and you go back to work for a day or two,

or whatever period of time, or you're going anywhere else, you may be

subjected to all sorts of inquiries.



You are instructed and ordered to turn away any inquiry. Just tell

them you cannot talk about it and you won't talk about it.



If anybody forces themselves on you, or try to force opinions upon

you, please notify me at your earliest possible convenience, write it

down in a note and give it the to the bailiff.



That would be a crime on the part of anyone out in the audience or

anyone else, to try to talk to you about this case. They would be

interfering with the process of justice. So please advise me if

anything like that happens.



All right. See you at 1:30.



Thank you.

We call Steven Schwab.



STEVEN SCHWAB, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiff Goldman, was

duly sworn and testified as follows:



THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in

the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole

truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: My name is Steven Schwab, S-T-E-V-E-N, S-C-H-W-A-B.



THE CLERK: Thank you.



DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Schwab.



A. Good afternoon.



Q. I'm going to give you this pointer; it will make it easier on you.

Where do you live?



A. I live on Montana Avenue, between Westgate and Bundy, approximately

there.



(Indicating to map of Bundy area.)



Q. This is Westgate. I'm pointing to this street?



A. Yes, this would be Westgate.



Q. You point to the street east of Bundy. We're referring to east of

Bundy. We're referring to Exhibit 18, for the record. Did you live

there on June 12, 1994?



A. Yes, I did.



Q. Did you have pets on June 12, 1994?



A. Yes. I own two pets, a dog and a cat.



Q. And did you take your dog for a walk in the evening?



A. Yes, I did.



Q. What was your routine, let's say, for a weekday?



A. During the week, I used to walk my dog between 11:00 and 11:30 at

night.



Q. On the weekends. Excuse me.



A. Weekends were a little different. On the weekends, I tended to walk

-- I walked my dog between 10:30 and 11:00.



Q. On June 12, 1994 -- that was a Sunday, right?



A. That was a Sunday night, yes.



Q. What time did you leave to walk your dog?



A. That night, I left just after 10:30.



Q. How do you know that?



A. Well, my routine was, on Sunday nights, at that time, was to watch

the Dick Van Dyke Show from 10:00 to 10:30, and then walk my dog from

10:30 until 11:00, so I would be home by 11 o'clock to watch the Mary

Tyler Moore Show.



Q. Are you in the entertainment business?



A. Yes; I work in television.



Q. Okay. So you left on June 12, in the evening, at 10:30?



A. Yes, that's right.



Q. What is the route that you took on your dog walk? Do you want to

point it on out on Exhibit 18 and describe what you're doing, sir?



A. Well, my routine was to leave my apartment on Montana, walk down

Montana to the corner of Montana and Bundy, then cross Bundy and

continue down until I got to this street, which is Gretna Green.



I would then turn left and walk down Gretna Green one block, until I

got to Gorham. Then I walked up one block along Gorham 'till I got to

this street here, which is Amherst.



I turned left at Amherst and continued one block until I got to

Dorothy; then I would turn left again, walk down Dorothy, past Gretna

Green. Then I would get to the corner of Dorothy and Bundy, and then I

would continue along Bundy, and then turn right and walk back to my

home on Montana.



Q. Okay. Now, when you used to get to the corner of Dorothy and Bundy,

in your typical routine, what side of the street would you walk north

on Bundy, on the west side or the east side?



A. When I was walking on Bundy, I tended to walk on the east side of

the street along Bundy.



Q. And this little icon here represents 875 South Bundy --



A. Uh-huh.



Q. -- the home of Nicole Brown Simpson at that time. Why did you walk

across the street?



A. Well, that side of Bundy, the east side of Bundy is much better lit

along the sidewalk. The west side is much darker.



Q. And typically, how long would it take, based on your normal

routine, when you left your house, to get to the corner of Dorothy and

Bundy?



A. That would take me approximately 20 minutes or so.



Q. Okay. Now, on this evening, when you left at 10:30 p.m., as you

approach the corner of Dorothy and Bundy, what happened?



A. As I approached the corner of Dorothy and Bundy, I saw that there

was a large white dog at the corner, barking at the building on the

corner.



Q. Can you point to where you saw the dog?



A. Yes. I saw the dog here at the corner, as I was walking between

this alley and Bundy.



Q. You were on the north side of the street here?



A. At this time, I was on the north side of the street, yeah.



Q. And you saw the dog on this northwest corner right here?



A. That's correct.



Q. And the dog was on the sidewalk?



A. The dog was on the sidewalk. There's a corner building here with a

path that leads to the door. The dog was looking down that path and

barking at the building.



Q. A door to a building?



A. To a house, a house.



MR. PETROCELLI: And, Steve, why don't you put up the next exhibit. I

think it's 28.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Do you recognize the dog in Exhibit 28?



A. Yes.



Q. Is that the dog that you saw on the evening of June 12, 1994, at

the corner of Dorothy and Bundy?



A. Yes, it is.



Q. We'll leave that up for a second. Approximately what time was it

when you saw the dog at the corner of Dorothy and Bundy?



A. That would have been approximately 10:55.



Q. Okay.



A. Yeah.



Q. And what happened when you saw the dog?



A. Well, I approached the dog. I was surprised to see a dog loose on

the street without an owner. There was no one else around at that

time. And I slowly approached the dog and allowed the dog to smell me.

And I patted its head to kind of -- to get its confidence. And I

noticed that it was wearing a collar. So I touched the collar and

turned it around, to try to find if there was a tag that would say

where the dog was from, but there was no tag. It was just the collar.



Q. Did the dog have a leash?



A. There was no leash on the dog.



Q. Did you notice anything unusual about the dog?



A. As I looked down at the dog, I noticed -- first thing I noticed was

that there was a drip of blood on one of the back legs of the dog, and

I bent down further to examine it. I saw that there was blood on the

paws of the dog, and that the underside and chest of the dog was very

dirty. It was -- there was mud or blood on the chest of the dog.



Q. Did the blood appear -- the drip of blood that you described, did

that appear moist or dry?



A. Yes, it appeared moist. It was red and shiny.



Q. Did the dog have a leash?



A. There was no leash on the dog, no.



Q. What happened next? Well, before I get there, you said the dog was

barking?



A. Yes.



Q. In what direction?



A. The dog was barking towards the corner house.



Q. Okay.



A. Towards the door of the house.



Q. What kind of barking was it?



A. A loud barking, as if to get -- try to get someone's attention,

maybe to wake someone up within the house.



Q. Okay. Now, after you saw the dog with the blood on him, what did

you do?



A. Well, I looked around to see if there was anyone in the area, but

there wasn't.



So at that point, I crossed the street to the other side of Bundy, to

see what the dog would do, if it would head off in one direction or

another, perhaps lead me back to where it had come from.



But the dog didn't do that; the dog stayed with me, followed myself

and my dog across the street, to the other side of Bundy.



Q. Okay. So with the pointer -- you're saying -- I'll try to trace the

route here -- and you cross the street, onto this side of the street,

the east side, right?



A. Yes, that's correct.



Q. Where you thought it was better lit?



A. That's my general route home because it's better lit on that side

of the street.



Q. Than on the other side?



A. Yeah.



Q. And you started walking north on Bundy?



A. Yes.



Q. And -- with your dog?



A. With my dog.



Q. And what was the Akita doing?



A. The Akita was doing an interesting thing. It was continuing this

pattern of barking at the houses. As I walked along the street, as we

passed the path to each house, it would look up the path and bark at

the house. But once I got a few steps beyond, it would stop and catch

up with myself and my dog.



Q. Okay. And then you continued on home?



A. I continued on towards home, yes.



Q. And what time did you get home?



A. I got home at approximately 11:05. The TV was still on when I got

home, and the Mary Tyler Moore Show was on. And it was early -- and it

was early in the episode. It was the beginning of the episode.



Q. Now, from 10:55, when you found the dog, to 11:05, when you got

home, did you make any stops along the way?



A. Well, as I was walking up Bundy, I saw a police car drive by, so I

flagged down the police officer, told him that I had found this stray

dog, and I told him the corner where I found the dog.



And he told me to go on home, and that he would take care of things.



But as I walked, turned on Bundy towards home, the dog continued to

follow me, so the police officer followed in his car. But when we got

to Montana, he said it was obvious that the dog wanted to stay with

me, and would it be okay if I took the dog home, and that he would

call animal control and that they would contact me.



And I said it was fine, that I would take the dog home at this point.



Q. And you did?



A. I did. I took the dog back to my apartment building.



Q. And did you take the dog inside your house?



A. Well, the dog, no. No, I didn't.



Q. Tell us what happened.



A. The dog followed. I live on the second floor. And the dog followed

me up to the landing of my building. And I have a cat, so I didn't

want to let the dog inside, so I kept the dog on the landing, and told

my wife what had happened, about finding the dog, and showed her the

dog.



And I got a spare leash from the closet, and then went back down to

the front of my building to wait for people from animal control to

come by.



Q. Did you get a closer look at the dog, to see where the blood was?



A. Yes. The courtyard of my building is much better lit. There are

lights, and the pool is lit. And there's lights in the stairway.



So at this point, I was able to look at the dog more closely. I was

afraid that the dog had cut itself, that there was glass in one of the

paws, and that's where the blood had come from.



I examined the dog more closely and didn't find any glass or any trace

of injury on the dog itself.



Q. Then what happened?



A. Well, I noticed that the dog was dehydrated.



First, when the people didn't come from animal control, I thought

about walking the dog back towards Dorothy and Bundy, to see if maybe

the owners would appear.



But when I tried to walk the dog along Montana, it pulled back in the

other direction. It wouldn't walk in that direction.



So I went back to the courtyard and I noticed that the dog was very

dehydrated. At that point, it was panting. So I went upstairs to get

some water for the dog. I filled my dog's bowl with water and got it

downstairs.



As I was walking there, I noticed I had gotten a call, that the light

was blinking on my answering machine, so I brought the dog some water

and went back upstairs, and discovered that the call was from people

at animal control.



Q. And then what happened?



A. Well, I called back the people at animal control. They said they

wouldn't be able to come pick up the dog, that they were closing at

midnight; that if they didn't pick up the dog by midnight, that they

would be closed up for the night. I said, does that mean that the dog

would be alone? And they said yes.



And so I told them that I didn't know what I would be doing at that

point. I didn't like the idea of driving the dog to animal control and

it being locked up in a cage overnight by itself.



So I went back downstairs -- my wife was with the dog at this point --

to discuss with my wife what we should do about the dog. We thought

about bringing it inside. I didn't want to freak out my cat by

bringing this big dog into the house, so I went downstairs to discuss

with my wife what we should do with the dog.



Q. And what happened next?



A. Well, then my neighbor, Sukru, came home and --



Q. What is his last name?



A. Sukru Boztepe. And he was surprised to see me with this big Akita,

and asked me what happened.



And I told him what happened and our dilemma with the people from

animal control. And we discussed what to do. But then he offered to

take the dog for the night, and that I would get it back from him in

the morning so I could put up lost dog posters, to see if we could

find the owner.



And so we agreed to do that. I gave him the dog.



Q. Approximately what time did you give Mr. Boztepe the dog?



A. Well, I gave him the dog at about 11:50 or so. He had come home

about 11:40, and we discussed it for approximately ten minutes or so.



Q. So you were out in your courtyard with Mr. Boztepe and your wife,

and you were talking to him about ten minutes?



A. Yes. His wife, Bettina, had come out of her apartment building --

he lives directly under me -- and so she came out when she heard us

talking to Sukru, and we all discussed it for a while. But at 11:50, I

handed him the leash, and went upstairs to bed.



Q. And what happened in the morning?



A. Well, at around 5:00 a.m., there was someone pounding on my door,

so I got up out of bed. And it was two -- there was two detectives who

said they wanted to talk to me about the dog in connection with a

murder.



Q. And what did you tell the detectives?



A. Well --



MR. BAKER: Objection. Hearsay.



THE COURT: Sustained.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Were you awakened from a sound sleep?



A. Yes, I was.



Q. Did you indicate the time that you found the dog on the corner of

Dorothy and Bundy to the detectives?



MR. P. BAKER: Hearsay.



THE COURT: You can answer yes or no.



THE WITNESS: Can I hear the question again?



MR. PETROCELLI: I'll withdraw the question.



THE COURT: All right.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) When you handed the dog off at 11:40 to 11:50,

that's the last you saw --



A. That's the last time I saw the dog, yes.



Q. Okay.



MR. P. BAKER: We have no questions. Thank you.



THE COURT: Thank you.



MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.



THE WITNESS: Thank you.



MR. PETROCELLI: On this next witness, the defense and the plaintiffs

have stipulated to an additional Exhibit No. 32, a photo of Nicole

Brown Simpson in the walkway.



(The instrument herein described was marked for identification as

Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 32.)



We call Sukru Boztepe as our next witness.



SUKRU BOZTEPE, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiff Goldman, was

duly sworn and testified as follows:



THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in

the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole

truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?



THE WITNESS: I do.



THE CLERK: Please be seated. And, sir if you would, please state and

spell your name for the record.



THE WITNESS: Sukru Bozdepe, S-U-K-R-U, B-O-Z-D-E-P-E



DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q. Good afternoon, sir.



A. Good afternoon.



Q. On June 12, 1994, where did you live?

Q. You want to point there, sir?



(Witness complies, points to map.)



A. Right up here.



Q. What time in the evening did you come home?



A. 11:40 p.m.



Q. What happened when you came home?



A. When I entered courtyard, I see Dennis Schwab and Dana Schwab and

that white dog in the courtyard.



MR. PETROCELLI: Steve, can you put on Exhibit 28.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Recognize the dog in Exhibit 28?



A. Yes, that was the dog.



Q. That was the dog you saw in the courtyard with Mr. Schwab?



A. Yes.



Q. That's a little awkward. See if you can talk right in that

microphone. Thank you.



As a result of your conversation with Mr. Schwab, did you then take

the dog?



A. Yes, I did.



Q. And what did you do with the dog?



A. I took the dog inside, in our apartment, and we were going to go to

sleep, but the dog starts acting too nervous, starts running around,

scratching the door, so we were uncomfortable with the dog, to sleep.

Then we decided to take the dog for a walk.



Q. Now, had Mr. Schwab told you where he found the dog?



A. Yes, he did.



Q. Okay. Did you decide to take the dog back to that area?



A. Yes.



Q. And what was that area?



A. The corner of Bundy and Dorothy.



Q. Okay. So you started walking. You want to trace the route that you

walked? What time did you leave your house?



A. Just before midnight.



Q. Just before midnight. Okay. With the dog. And who else was with

you?



A. My wife Bettina.



Q. Bettina. You, Bettina, and the Akita?



A. Yes.



Q. Can you tell us the route that you took?



(Witness indicates to map of Bundy area.)



You can get out of your seat.



A. We left from here.



Q. You're going west on Montana?



A. Yes. And we cross Montana at this point.



Q. Now you're going south on Bundy, on the east side?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. Keep going.



A. Then we cross -- we continue. We cross the street.



Q. Past Gorham?



A. And then we cross to Bundy in that way.



Q. Okay. Now, you cross to the west side --



A. Yes.



Q. -- of Bundy.



A. And then we continue down this way.



Q. Okay. Down in the direction of where we have this little red house

there, right?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. And was the dog doing anything unusual?



A. Well, the dog was all right until here.



Q. You're pointing to Bundy, just north of Gorham?



A. Yes.



Q. The dog was acting normally until that point?



A. Yes.



Q. And then?



A. Then dog starts pulling me a little bit hard. And then we cross the

street. And then it start pulling harder, and it kind of forced me to

cross the street with him.



Q. So the dog actually pulled you across the street?



A. Yeah. And then start pulling harder and harder and harder until

this point; then just here, it stopped.



Q. Okay. Now you're pointing to the one which represents 875 South

Bundy?



A. Yes.



Q. You're saying the dog stopped there?



A. Yes.



Q. And where on the sidewalk did the dog stop?



A. Dog stopped basically on the sidewalk in front of the pathway to

875.



Q. And where were you in relation to the dog?



A. Just behind of it.



Q. So the dog is in front of you, and you're holding -- did you have a

leash?



A. Yes, I did.



Q. Got that leash from --



A. Steven.



Q. -- Steven Schwab?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. And when the dog stopped in front of 875 South Bundy, what

did it do?



A. It looked towards the house.



Q. What were the lighting conditions like?



A. It was very dark.



Q. Very dark?



A. Very dark.



Q. Could you see, or did you notice the sidewalk area where you were

stepping on?



A. Can you explain?



Q. Did you see anything on the sidewalk where you were stepping on?



A. Not really.



Q. Why? Because it was dark?



A. It was dark.



MR. BAKER: I object. Leading.



THE COURT: Sustained.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) What was the reason you couldn't see?



A. It wasn't lit enough.



Q. Okay. Now, what happened when you saw the dog staring down the

pathway?



A. I looked at the same direction.



Q. And what did you see?



A. I saw a lady laying down and full of blood.



MR. PETROCELLI: Steve, you have the next exhibit. I'll caution the

jury that this is a sensitive photograph.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Now, looking at this Exhibit 32, is that the

sight that you saw?



A. Yes.



Q. Was it as light as that?



A. No, not at all.



Q. What was the lighting like?



A. It was very dark.



Q. Very dark. And what were you able to see?



A. I saw just the lady; I could see that she was blond, and I could

see her arm. That's it.



Q. Okay. Did you -- could you step down here for a second, please,

sir. You see this part here before the pathway, is that the sidewalk?



A. I guess sidewalk.



Q. You were on the sidewalk?



A. Yes.



Q. And when you first saw the body of Nicole, was the dog looking in

that direction?



A. Yes.



Q. Had the dog not looked in that direction, would you have noticed

Nicole's body?



MR. BAKER: Objection. Calls for speculation.



THE COURT: Sustained.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Before the dog looked in that direction, did

you notice Nicole's body?



MR. BAKER: Objection. No foundation.



THE COURT: Overruled.



THE WITNESS: No, I didn't.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Excuse me?



A. I wouldn't.



Q. Okay. And did you -- did you take any steps down the pathway?



A. No, I didn't.



Q. Did the dog go down the pathway?



A. No.



Q. Did you form any opinion about whether this person was dead or

alive?



A. She was dead.



Q. That was what you saw?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay.



MR. PETROCELLI: You can take the picture off. You can sit down.



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) What did you then do?



A. I told my wife that that was a dead person there. And we crossed

the street, which is Bundy, here. I run to a house and I rang the bell

and knocked on the door. There was no answer.



And then we were walking to the next house towards north, and we had

seen a lady walking to her car. And we asked her to call 911. She said

okay, and she left.



We couldn't count on her, so we went to the next door around here. And

then we rang the door, and somebody answered, and we explained the

situation and made them call 911.



Q. So you knocked on the first door and nobody answered?



A. Nobody answered.



Q. And then you saw a woman going to her car across the street from

Nicole's condominium?



A. Not Nicole's condominium, but toward this side, maybe.



Q. On the opposite side of the street?



A. Yes.



Q. North?



A. Yes.



Q. How far past it?



A. Just around here, I guess. She passed toward here.



Q. You told that person to call 911?



A. Yes.



Q. And that person drove off?



A. Yes.



Q. And then you knocked on another neighbor's door --



A. Yes.



Q. -- next to the first person whose door you knocked on?



A. Yes.



Q. And you told that person to call 911?



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. What time was it when you first saw Nicole's body?



A. I can only guess. I don't remember.



Q. What is your best approximation?



A. 12:05.



Q. Shortly after midnight?



A. Yes, yes.



Q. You said you left your house shortly before midnight?



A. Yes.



Q. And you walked directly in the path that you took, right?



A. Yes.



Q. And did you make any stops?



A. No.



Q. Okay. You think it was about five minutes after midnight?



A. I would say so.



Q. After you knocked on the door of the second person, did that person

answer?



A. Yes, he did.



Q. And that person said that he or she would call 911?



A. Yes. It was he, and he called 911.



Q. What did you then do?



A. We wait.



Q. You waited with the dog?



A. Yes.



Q. And your wife Bettina?



A. Yes.



Q. Did the police arrive?



A. Yes; they arrived very shortly.



Q. Very shortly?



A. Yes.



Q. And what did you do then, when the police arrived?



A. We flagged them down and we told -- we told them about the scene.

And they took off and examined the scene.



Q. You pointed out to the police --



A. Yes.



Q. -- man what you had seen?



A. Yes.



Q. Did you cross the street and go back to the sidewalk?



A. No.



Q. You did it from across the street?



A. Yes.



Q. So you never did go back to the area where you first saw Nicole's

body?



A. No.



Q. Did you see another person's body besides Nicole's from your

vantage point out on the sidewalk?



A. No.



Q. Thank you.



CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:



Q. Couple questions, sir. When you were on Bundy, when the dog looked

up the pathway towards where you ultimately saw the body of Nicole

Brown Simpson, you were able to see that relatively clearly, were you

not?



A. Depends what "clearly" means.



Q. Well, let me ask you, you saw her lying down horizontally, did you

not?



A. Yes.



Q. You saw her face turned towards you?



A. Yes.



Q. And you saw that she was on her right side?



A. I think she was on her left side.



Q. Okay. And you were able to see that from the area where you had the

dog on the leash, correct?



A. Yes.



Q. And then, so the light -- and you were also able to determine from

your position out on the sidewalk that, in your mind, this woman was

deceased, correct?



A. What do you mean?



Q. She was dead.



A. Yes.



Q. Okay. And you had enough light to make all those determinations

from the sidewalk, correct?



A. Well, I came to the conclusion of being that, because I understand

it was her dog, and the dog has been found --



Q. Okay



A. -- hours ago, and it was bloody. That's why I thought it was that.



Q. Fair enough. When the police got there, did you watch the police go

into the area where the body was?



A. Yes.



Q. And how many police were there when they initially -- strike that.



How many police arrived at the scene when you were there outside of

Bundy?



A. At first, or...



Q. First.



A. Two police officers.



Q. Okay. And did you see them open the gate and walk in to where the

body was?



A. No. I wasn't close, so I didn't see anything, so -- I was across

the street, so I just see them.



THE REPORTER: I didn't understand.



THE WITNESS: They disappeared in the middle of bushes.



Q. Okay. Did you see any police officers go into the area where Nicole

Brown Simpson's body was located?



A. Well, both of them went through that direction. And I don't know

what they did.



Q. Did you subsequently remain there and see any other police officers

go into the crime scene?



A. You mean after the two police officers?



Q. Yes. Yes, sir.



A. Too many police officers came.



Q. Did you see any of them go into the crime scene beyond the gate,

into the area where you had visualized the body of Ms. Simpson lying

on her left side, or horizontally, facing towards Bundy?



A. Well, only thing I could see is beginning of the sidewalk and the

beginning of the path, because I was across the street, so I don't

know if they go to the gate or if not. So I don't know.



MR. BAKER: Thank you very much.



REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:



Q. Why did you stop in front of 875 South Bundy?



MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.



THE COURT: Sustained



Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Did you hear any noises when you were

approaching 875 South Bundy?



A. No.



Q. Okay. Thank you.



MR. BAKER: I don't have any questions.



THE COURT: Thank you. You're excused.



(Witness excused.)



MR. PETROCELLI: Resume Monday morning, Your Honor?



THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the witnesses that they

have for today. I have asked them to tighten up the witness scheduling

so that we may have full days. So hopefully, we'll be able to utilize

our time a little more efficiently. Have a nice weekend.



Again, let me advise you and order you not to talk to anybody about

this case. Don't let anybody talk to you about this case. Don't watch

anything on the news. If you see something in the newspapers, don't

read it, or in magazines, don't read it.



And as I said before, you know, you may have some curiosity about

what's been going on in the media. Well, please reserve that, and I'll

order you to reserve your viewing of those things to a time when this

is over.



You can have friends or somebody collect these things for you, if you

want, but you cannot read them yourselves. All right? And you cannot

watch tapes of these things or watch things on television or listen to

radio broadcasts about anything connected with this case.



Now I'm not quite sure, but I have also been informed that there are

various things on television and elsewhere that are attempts to mimic

the trial that we're having right now, with actors and things like

that. Don't watch those things, either.



Remember, everything that you are going to decide this case upon must

come from the trial, this trial itself, through your own eyes and

ears, and not from any other source.



If anybody does intrude upon your privacy, or if anybody tries to talk

to you about this case or influence you in any way, please advise the

Court immediately; don't wait. I don't want to hear about this

occurring two weeks down the line or two months down the line, I want

to hear about it immediately, so that we can take corrective action.



All right?



JURORS: (Nod affirmatively.)



THE COURT: Again, your notes will be secure with the bailiff, and they

will be locked up. We have specially bolted and locked with steel

locks, cabinets where we will be storing your things.



MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, I submitted a list of witnesses.



THE COURT: Yes.



MR. PETROCELLI: I'm just awaiting Mr. Baker's estimate on

cross-examination.



THE COURT: Thank you.



MR. BAKER: I lost the list.



MR. P. BAKER: I've got it somewhere.



THE COURT: All right. Then we'll be adjourned until Monday, 8:30.



Thank you.



(At 2:14 P.M. an adjournment was taken until Monday, October 28, 1996,

at 8:30 A.M.)

REPORTER'S DAILY TRANSCRIPT
OCTOBER 28, 1996

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES


SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
MONDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1996
8:54 A.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEE
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)


THE COURT: At this time, the Court will address the motion of Copley's
Press, et cetera.

MS. SAGER: Good morning. Kelli Sager on behalf of the nonparty media
organizations.

Our argument has been set forth in the motion. I don't want to take up
more of the Court's time than is necessary.

We have not received any opposition from any of the parties. I presume
that none has been filed with the Court. The motion is pretty
straightforward.

The blank questionnaires, it was our understanding, would be released
as soon as the jury was impaneled. That has not yet been done. We ask
the Court to do that immediately; and the questionnaires that have
already been filled out by jurors that were subjected to oral voir
dire that are the controlling cases in Copley and Lesher and
Press-Enterprise, which are quoted in our papers, we believe, should
also be released under the First Amendment.

We're not asking for identifying information such as names, addresses,
phone numbers, Social Security numbers, but all other information in
those questionnaires is considered part of the voir dire process which
is subject to the First Amendment Right of Access.

And since there have been no findings of any compelling interest
justifying closure order, we think there wouldn't be any blanket order
closure of the sort that is now in effect, we ask that it be
immediately released redacted version of those questionnaires that the
jurors identifying numbers, but no other name identifying information
on these.

I'm happy too answer any questions the Court has or if any opposition
is going to be presented at hearing; otherwise, we will not take up
any more of the Court's time.

THE COURT: The blank questionnaires are ordered released. The
questionnaires of all jurors who are not seated in the jury panel,
either as jurors or alternate jurors, are ordered released.

The questionnaires with regards to the jurors sitting in the jury
panel or as alternate jurors, they are ordered not released until the
conclusion of this program.

Court's inspection of the questionnaires convinces the Court that
there are numerous references from which the identity of the jurors
can be obtained by various investigative procedures which the press
has, in the past, undertaken to find out the identity of prospective
jurors.

My information is that, on prior cases, the jurors' identities have
been sought out and have been discovered in other cases without very
much investigation, based upon the curiosity of the press. And the
Court feels that the information in the questionnaires at various
points reveals such things as place of employment, names of persons
who are -- whose names are included in response to various portions of
the questionnaires, would easily link to the identification of the
jurors.

The jurors are not sequestered. It is important that the identity of
the jurors remain anonymous and not be revealed, because the Court is
concerned that the extensive efforts made by the press to pursue
persons who are involved in this case, whether they be parties,
witnesses, jurors or anybody else, has been extensive, or has itself
experienced the intrusiveness of this.

The Court is satisfied that it's necessary to protect the identity and
anonymity of the jurors throughout this trial, so that they will not
be affected by any pressures exerted by the media upon themselves and
their names families' places of employment.

Jurors are concerned that they are being pressured by people at their
places of employment, by family members -- pressure placed upon family
members by co-workers, and I think there is a supreme interest to be
preserved until this case is completed.

MS. SAGER: Your Honor, if I could ask one question: Does the Court
find that there is no portion of any of the questionnaires that could
be released without identifying the jurors, or any identification of
jurors?

THE COURT: I think the questions and answers are so inextricably
intertwined, that for the Court to spend its time going through 20 --
actually 60 questionnaires, when I'm trying to get this case done is,
I think, a little excessive. So the motion to that extent is denied on
those grounds.

MS. SAGER: Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Bring the jury in.

(Time is 9:56 a.m.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Morning.

JURORS: Good morning.

THE COURT: Mr. Kelly, call your next witness.

MR. KELLY: Good morning.

JURORS: Good morning.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, before we do call the witness, we've stipulated

Q. As a result of that radio call that you received at 1209 what if

Q. When you say you were flagged down, what exactly did you observe
upon arriving at 874 South Bundy?

A. I observed a male and female with a dog, coming down the steps of
868, and they were waving us down.

Q. Now, did you approach Bundy from the north or south?

Q. And you were heading north?

A. Right.

Q. And as you pulled up to 874 South Bundy, which side of the street
did you park on?

Q. Okay. And after making these initial observations, what did you do

Q. Okay. And other than the male and female, was there anybody else
there at this time?

A. No.

Q. And you also indicated there was a dog with them, also?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Was that dog running loose or in some other manner?

A. It was on a leash.

Q. Okay. And can you describe that dog for me.

A. I believe it was an Akita.

Q. And did you make any observations as to the Akita's condition as
you approached the two people with the dog?

A. Not at that time, no.

Q. Okay. After you had a conversation with these two people, what, if
anything, did you do next, Officer?

A. They directed us across the street. They said there was a dead lady
across the street.

Q. And do you recall the area in which -- vicinity -- they directed
you?

A. 875 South Bundy.

Q. Okay. And as you approached 875 South Bundy, could you describe the
lighting conditions at the front of 875 South Bundy at that time?

A. It was very poor.

Q. Dark?

A. Dark.

Q. Okay. And what about the foliage, if any, around the entrance of
875 South Bundy?

A. There is a large, overhanging tree over the walkway. Made it even
darker.

Q. And were you able to see the front entrance without utilizing your
flashlight?

A. No.

Q. As you approached 857 South Bundy, where, first, did you direct
your attention to?

A. Towards the grassy areas south of the walkway.

Q. And did you observe a walkway leading to the front of 875?

A. Not really.

Q. Okay. So as I understand, you first went to an area that went up to
that walkway?

A. Right.

Q. Did you have your flashlight on at that time?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. As you were in that grassy area to the left of the sidewalk of 875
South Bundy, did you make any observations, initially, at this time?

A. No.

Q. After your initial observations, which there were none, what, if
anything, did you do next, Officer?

A. The witnesses directed us to the walkway, which would be to the
north.

Q. Okay. That would be to the right of the area you were?

A. Right.

Q. Okay. What, if anything, did you do after you were directed to that
vicinity by the witnesses?

A. I looked down the walkway, using my flashlight, and saw a female
laying on the walkway.

Q. Okay. Can you describe that female?

A. Female, white and black dress, blond hair.

Q. And did you make any other observations as to the area immediately
surrounding that woman you observed?

A. There was blood approximately halfway down the walkway.

Q. Now, at that time, Officer, on making those observations, would it
be fair to say that you recognized that area as a crime scene?

A. Yes.

Q. And being a patrol officer, having just arrived at a crime scene,
did you have any duties and responsibilities at that time?

A. I had called for additional units. We set up for a crime scene, had
a call for an ambulance for the lady, called the supervisor.

Q. And are there any other steps that you're required to take in terms
of first arriving at a crime scene, also?

A. We have to try to clear it for any additional victims or suspects,
identify and preserve evidence.

Q. And were you taking steps to do that immediately upon these
observations?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Now, after you had gone out and dispatched for additional
help and an ambulance, what, if anything, did you do next?

A. I advised my partner, "Grab a hold of the witnesses, find out what
they saw or how they found the lady."

We recontacted them, and I observed a dog to have blood on his legs.

Q. The Akita you had observed earlier?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, after you made those observations, what, if anything, did you
do next, Officer?

A. We went back across the street to 875 and approached the female. I
was approximately halfway up the walkway, and before, in the foliage
next to the walkway, and I saw the male leaning against the north
fence.

MR. KELLY: See if I can have 32, please.

Could you make it a little more distant.

THE COURT: That's good. Just like that.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, Officer, are you able to see that photo that's
up there right now?

A. Yes.

Q. Could you indicate, first of all for the ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, where you had first focused your attention the first time
you approached South Bundy, through a pointer on the podium?

A. You can't see it on this photograph; it's like over here, there's a
grassy area.

Q. That's where you first went?

A. Initially? Right.

Q. Now, you indicated that you had called for backup and a supervisor
and an ambulance as you approached a second time, also?

A. Right.

Q. And could you indicate where you approached at that time?

A. I walked through these plants up to the call box there.

Q. And did you at any time step on that walkway going up to 875?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Did your partner step on that walkway going up to 875?

A. No, he didn't.

Q. Now, you also indicated that when you got approximately halfway up
there, you had made additional observations?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. What was that?

A. I saw the body of Mr. Goldman leaning against the north fence.

Q. In that photo, as it appears there, there appears to be blood
that's running all the way down to the front sidewalk there.

Was that the way it appeared when you arrived there at 12:13 on June
13 --

A. No.

Q. -- 1994? Could you indicate with your pointer approximately how far
down the blood had run when you arrived there that morning.

A. About the midpoint.

MR. KELLY: Now, this next photo might be difficult to look at, also. I
Just want you to put up , Steve.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, do you recognize that photo, Officer Riske?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And what do you recognize that to be?

A. That would be the body of Mr. Goldman, as I saw him that night.

Q. Okay. And where were you located when you first made that
observation?

A. I was standing in the foliage next to the call box.

Q. And did you attempt to get any closer at that time when you made
that observation?

A. No, I didn't.

MR. KELLY: Steve, could you make that a little more distant, please.
That's good.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, in addition to the young male you saw in that
photo there, did you make any other observations at that time?

A. There's some articles of evidence in this picture.

Q. And did you observe them at this time when you had approached the
front call box on the lot?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Can you tell me, first of all, what additional items you observed
at that point?

A. The envelope. There's a glove and a hat underneath the plant
(witness indicates).

Q. Okay. First of all, could you point out the envelope, please.

A. (Witness indicates.)

Q. And is that located exactly where it was when you observed it that
morning?

A. Yes.

Q. And secondly, could you point out the glove you observed.

A. This is a bad photo. You can't really see. It's in the same -- it's
in that area, but you can't see it clearly.

MR. KELLY: Could you bring it up closer. Steve.

A. That would be the glove right there. (Indicating.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Okay. And are you able to see a portion of that hat,
also, in that picture?

A. I believe the hat is up here a little farther.

Q. If we go down to the lower right, maybe --

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

A. Can't really see in that picture.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) If I might, if -- can you step up here for a moment,
Officer. I direct your attention down to that area there.

A. Right.

Q. Okay. Now, upon a closer look, do you recall where you observed the
hat at this time?

A. Yes.

Q. Where would that be?

A. In the lower right.

Q. Can you indicate one more time --

MR. KELLY: Steve, could you back up a little bit.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, can you indicate once again where the hat was,
Officer?

A. It's in the lower right.

Q. Now, in addition to making those observations, did you make any
others in terms of potential evidence in that immediate vicinity at
this time?

A. Yes.

Q. And what was that?

A. There appeared to be a bloody heel mark in the walkway and bloody
footprints leading up the steps toward the house.

Q. The bloody heel print, does that appear in that picture there?

A. Can't really see it.

Q. And with regard to the bloody footprints going up the stairs, was
that towards the house?

A. Towards the house.

Q. Did you observe any bloody footprints in the front sidewalk, going
away from the house?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. What, if anything, did you do, Officer, after making this second
observation near -- the second time you approached the front gate?

A. I saw the bloody footprints leading towards the front of the house
and observed the front door to be open, and I assumed that the
footprints probably went inside. So my partner and I stepped over the
body and went to the front door.

Q. When you stepped over the body, can you describe for us exactly how
you were able to do that?

A. Stay to the far left of the walkway, against the fence.

MR. KELLY: Steve, can you take that picture down, first of all. I'm
sorry.

(Steve complies)

A. And went up on a landing, toward the front door.

Q. And did anybody accompany you at that time?

A. My partner.

Q. Who was?

A. Officer Terrazas.

Q. And what, if anything, did you observe as you approached the front
door at that time?

A. I observed the footprints that continued westbound through the
walkway, past the house.

Q. And did you observe anything other than bloody footprints before
you reached the front door?

A. There was a drop of blood. It was on the left of the footprint. I
forget exactly where it was.

Q. That was before you reached the front door?

A. Right.

Q. And when you arrived at the front door, was it opened or closed?

A. It was opened.

Q. And did the bloody footprints appear to head towards the door and
continue to the back?

A. They continued westbound on the walkway.

Q. As you approached the door, also, was there any indication of a
forced entry on that door?

A. No.

Q. What, if anything, did you do next as you arrived at the door,
Officer?

A. We entered the residence on the landing, to see if there was any
evidence of ransacking or any evidence of blood in the house.

Q. Did you see any doors open?

A. No.

Q. Any cupboards open?

A. No.

Q. Any furniture overturned?

A. No.

Q. Any sign of ransacking?

A. No.

Q. Any indication that the crime scene extended inside the house?

A. No.

Q. Any bloody footprints?

A. No.

Q. Any drops of blood?

A. No.

Q. Anybody in the house at this time?

A. At that time, we didn't check the whole house, no.

Q. What, if anything, did you observe after that?

A. I observed a lithograph on the wall. It appeared to be O.J.
Simpson. And as I went to the kitchen, there was an envelope, it had
O.J. Simpson as a return address.

Q. What did you do next, after making those observations?

A. I used a phone to call my watch commander.

Q. Who was your watch commander?

A. Sergeant David Rossi.

Q. Now, you usually carry what's called a "rover," do you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And what is a rover?

A. It's a radio, like a walkie-talkie.

Q. And would that have put you in communication with your watch
commander, also?

A. Yes.

Q. And you chose not to use that at that time?

A. Yes.

Q. And why was that?

A. Because the media has scanners and they

scan our frequency. If I would have used my radio, told them exactly
what I had, the media would have got there before anybody else.

Q. After you made this phone call, what, if anything, did you do next?

A. I went back outside, told my partner to grab the witnesses, and I
went around down the walkway, around the north side in the neighbor's
yard.

Q. If I can hold up a little bit. How did you exit the house then?

A. Through the front door and down the landing.

Q. And how did you go down the landing and the walkway, once again?

A. Staying to the far left, away from the blood, stepped over the
female.

Q. To the best of your knowledge, did you ever put your foot in the
blood at any time?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever observe your partner?

A. No.

Q. And when you headed back out that sidewalk, was it in the same
bushy area to the south side of the sidewalk?

A. We just stepped over the bushes and went through the grass.

Q. What, avoiding the sidewalk at all times?

A. Yes.

Q. As you arrived back out on the street, then, after exiting the
house, what, if any further action, did you take?

A. I personally went north in the neighbor's yard, to the north of the
male body, and observed the pager laying on the ground. And I checked
to see if he was alive.

Q. First of all, how did you approach the vicinity north of the
enclosed area when you went there?

A. A dirt path that leads back to the fence.

Q. Is that a clear path?

A. Clear as a path with nothing on it.

Q. And did you have your flashlight on at that point?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Were you using it at that point?

A. Yes.

Q. In what manner were you using the flashlight as you approached that
area north of the gated area of 875 South Bundy?

A. I shined it on the ground and in the bushes, make sure I didn't
mess up any evidence.

Q. Were you looking for additional evidence, if any?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you see any evidence prior to arriving at the gate, on the
outside, on the north side?

A. Just his pager, or a pager.

Q. Did you look in the vicinity elsewhere outside the gated area,
also, north of the enclosed area?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you look in the vicinity east of the gated area towards the
front of 875 Bundy with your flashlight, also?

A. Yes.

Q. When you say you were using a flashlight, Officer, what type of
flashlight is that, by the way?

A. It's extremely light; it's aluminum. It's about 30,000 candle
power.

Q. That's standard police issue.

A. You have to buy it yourself.

(Laughter.)

Q. Standard police issue if you pay for it?

A. Standard police issue would be plastic.

Q. Okay. So this was much stronger than a standard police-issue
flashlight?

A. Right.

Q. Powerful flashlight?

A. Right.

Q. You personally bought it for that reason?

A. Right.

Q. Now, after approaching on the north side there, in making these
observations in the immediate vicinity, what, if anything, did you do
next?

A. I checked Mr. Goldman to see if he was alive.

Q. And was he?

A. No.

Q. And in what manner did you check?

A. I touched his eyeball with my finger, checking for involuntary
blinking, or I used my light to illuminate his pupil. And there was no
dilation or anything.

Q. And you were still on the north side, outside the gated area, at
this point?

A. That's correct.

Q. And at that point, where you're with your light, were you able to
observe the glove you had seen earlier, also?

A. Yes.

Q. And the hat?

A. I believe the bush was covering the hat.

Q. Were you able to see any other items of what appeared to you to be
evidence at this time, when you shined your light around?

A. No.

Q. And then did -- did you leave that area?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what did you do next?

A. I went back out to the street. As I did so, Officer Wally and
officer McGowan arrived.

Q. And did anybody else?

A. Initially, just those. And then Sergeant Coon arrived a couple of
seconds later.

Q. When Wally and McGowan arrived, were they patrol officers, also --

A. Yes.

Q. -- in uniform?

A. Yes.

Q. Driving a black and white?

A. Yes.

Q. And where did they park their car?

A. On the west side of the street, north of, probably, 873.

Q. That's on the same side as 875 South Bundy?

A. Right.

Q. And shortly after they arrived, did someone else arrive there,
also?

A. Sergeant Coon.

Q. And by the way, Sergeant Coon, that's not the same one from the
Rodney King case?

A. No.

Q. Okay. Now, when he arrived, did you have a discussion with him?

A. Yes.

Q. And what, if anything, did you tell them?

A. I just told them we had a double homicide, and where I was,
basically. And Sergeant

Coon gave out marching orders.

Q. What were the marching orders that Sergeant Coon gave out?

A. Officer Terrazas was at the rear location, to secure the rear.
Officer McGowan started setting up crime-scene tape, and Officer Wally
and I entered the house and searched it.

Q. Taking these one step at a time, did you see how Officer Terrazas
left for the rear of the house?

A. He left southbound, Bundy and Dorothy.

Q. And Dorothy up to the alleyway?

A. I saw him go southbound on Bundy.

Q. And did you see McGowan start setting up the crime-scene tape?

A. Yes.

Q. By the way, prior to June 13, 1994, had you been the first officer
on the scene on prior occasions?

A. Yes.

Q. Approximately how many times?

A. To crime scenes?

Q. Yeah.

A. Twenty.

Q. And how many of those 20 crime scenes were actually homicides?

A. Fifteen.

Q. All right. And at those 15 homicides, was it your primary
responsibility of identifying evidence and observing a crime scene?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, going back to Officer McGowan, did you see him actually start
using the crime-scene tape to secure the front of 875 South Bundy?

A. Yes, I did.

MR. KELLY: Steve, may I see 133, please.

Bring it a little more in focus, if possible.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Officer, do you recognize that location?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that the front of 875 South Bundy?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. I was wondering if you could step down a minute; it might be easier
for you to point out a couple things. The pointer is behind you there.

Once again, can you indicate when you first arrived at the scene, you
spoke to those two people, when you first looked for the body you had
been directed to.

A. In the grassy area, over here. (Indicating.)

Q. And later on, you had indicated that when you came out of the house
the second time, you were going to the sidewalk north of 875 South
Bundy, to approach the gated area from the outside?

A. It was a dirt path, not a sidewalk.

Q. Well, do you see that area there?

A. It's like, right in here. (Indicating.)

Q. That's where you proceeded up and observed Mr. Goldman?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Thank you. You may have a seat. The way that crime-scene
tape, that's the way it was taped off that morning after McGowan was
done?

A. Yes. There's actually two separate areas were taped.

Q. And if I could see . . .

Do you recognize that photograph, Officer?

A. Yes.

Q. And what is that?

A. That's the rear alley of 875 Bundy.

Q. And the crime-scene tape -- first of all, that yellow tape is the
crime-scene tape, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And that tape that is closest to us, do you know what is standing
across there?

A. It's the foot of the alley of Dorothy.

Q. And there's crime-scene tape down at that distance, also?

A. Right.

Q. Where is that located relative to 875 South Bundy?

A. That's the rear of one house north of 875 South Bundy.

Q. Can you just point out that tape that you see at the far end.

A. (Witness complies, indicating.)

Q. There's a black-and-white patrol car in that photo, also. Is that
inside the tape or outside?

A. It's outside the tape.

Q. And do you recognize the individual in that picture, also?

A. That's me.

Q. And where are you standing relative to the rear of 875 South Bundy?

A. To the rear of the driveway.

Q. After the front and rear had been secured of this crime scene with
the tape you indicated that you and Police Officer Wally did something
that Sergeant Coon --

A. We searched the house while the crime-scene tape was being set up.

Q. And can you describe for us the manner in which you entered and
searched the house with Officer Wally?

A. We went in the grassy area, stepped over the body of the female at
the landing of the front door.

Q. Upon entering the front of the house, what did you do then?

A. We searched the lower level, back to the garage. Then we went up to
the second level and searched that.

Q. Can you describe exactly how you went through the first level of
the house?

A. We went -- we checked the living room farthest east. Then we went
back to the garage, went down and checked in the garage.

Q. Did you -- in the living room, do you recall what living -- what
room you went into next?

A. The dining room, then the kitchen.

Q. The kitchen where you made the phone call, by the way?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: Can I see . . .

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you recognize that photo there, Officer?

A. That's the kitchen of 875 South Bundy.

Q. That's where you made the call to Sergeant Rossi?

A. Right. You can't see it; there's a counter on this side you can't
see.

Q. To the left of that picture?

A. Right.

Q. That's where the phone was?

A. Right. Yes.

Q. That's where you made the call.

MR. KELLY: You can take that down.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) After you went through the kitchen with Officer
Walsh, where did you proceed to next?

A. To the rear of the residence. That's a family-room area. Searched
that. Then we went down to the garage.

Q. And did you make any observations as you approached the garage?

A. There's a couple of ice creams sitting on a bannister.

Q. Did you touch that at all?

A. No.

Q. Did you touch anything on the first floor, as you went through the
house?

A. No.

Q. By the way, as you went through the house, did you observe any
signs of ransacking, disturbance, blood, bloody footprints, drops of
blood anywhere on the first floor of the house?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. And when you arrived at the garage, you went through the garage,
also?

A. Yes.

Q. What, if anything, did you observe in there?

A. Just a car. Nothing really out of ordinary.

Q. Nothing disturbed?

A. No.

Q. Where did you proceed to next?

A. It was a laundry room, and then I believe a maid's quarters are
downstairs, checked them. Then I went up to the second floor.

Q. Were these children in the same room or separate rooms?

A. Separate.

these two children?

A. Open.

Q. And did you wake the children at this time?

A. No.

A. We continued eastbound and checked out the master bedroom, master
bath. There was a workout area.

Q. What, if any, observations did you make in the master bedroom?

A. There was a TV on. I believe there was a table lamp on. The covers
on the bed were kind of piled in the middle.

Q. The bed wasn't made, was it?

A. No.

Q. You also indicated you went into the master bathroom?

A. Right.

Q. What observations did you make in there?

A. The tub was full of water, and there were some candles burning to
the west of that.

that. And then Officer Walsh stayed by the children's bedrooms, and I
went down and told my supervisor we had two children in the house. And
we had to take them out the back.

Q. Who was your supervisor?

A. Sergeant Coon.

Q. And where did you meet him at?

A. He was down in the grassy area. I was on the landing. I just yelled
to him.

Q. And after you told him that, what, if anything, did you do next?

A. I walked westbound on the walkway, to the rear gate.

Q. Now, facing the front of 875 South Bundy, this walkway you're
referring to, where is it in relation to the front of the house?

A. It's to the north of the front of the house.

Q. Would that be to the right of it?

A. Right.

Q. And does that walkway extend all the way from the front of the
house to the rear alley?

A. Yes.

Q. And is that a level walkway, or is it different levels?

A. No, there's different levels.

Q. And as you started back that walkway, did you have your flashlight
on or off?

A. On.

Q. And at that time, did you make any observations as you started back
on the walkway?

A. I observed what appeared to be bloody footprints continue
westbound, and they faded approximately halfway, and observed what
appeared to be blood drops.

Q. And you indicated earlier that when you first approached the front
door, you had also seen bloody footprints and a blood drop to the left
of those footprints; is that right?

A. Right.

Q. Did you take a good look at that first blood drop, first of all,
that you observed next to the footprints?

A. Just to verify if it was blood or not.

Q. Can you describe that blood drop, as you saw it.

A. It was red, appeared to be moist, about maybe the size of a dime, a
little smaller than a dime.

Q. Was it fresh blood?

A. Appeared to be fresh.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. BLASIER: Excuse me. No foundation.

THE COURT: "Moist" may mean fresh. Sustained

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) You observed blood down by the two bodies on the
lower level?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you describe that blood drop in relation to the other blood you
observed on the other level?

A. They were very similar, looked to be the same.

Q. In terms of consistency?

A. Right.

Q. Moisture?

A. Yes.

Q. Color?

A. Yes.

Q. Red. In your opinion, it was --

A. It was blood.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: That it was blood, overruled.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) And as you headed towards the back of 875 South
Bundy, towards the alley, you indicated you observed additional drops
of blood, also?

A. Yes.

Q. You had occasion to look at them at this time?

A. Just so -- I passed them, so I wouldn't step in them.

Q. Would you be able to describe those other drops of blood that you
saw, also?

A. They were consistent in nature to the first one. It was red,
appeared to be moist.

Q. Sizewise?

A. I don't -- really don't recall the size.

Q. But they were consistent with the first ones you'd seen, also?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Did they appear to be -- did it appear to be new
blood?

A. Appeared to be fresh.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: New blood. Sustained.

Q. Moist?

A. Appeared to be fresh.

Q. Now, as you approached the rear of 875 South Bundy, is there
anything in the alley there or in the walkway there? I'm sorry.

A. There's a gate at the rear of the walkway.

Q. And as you approached that gate, did you make any observations of
that rear gate at that time?

A. I observed it to be blood on the inside of the rear gate. And I was
advised there was blood on the outside of the gate by my partner.

Q. First of all, as you approached the gate --

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Move to strike as hearsay.

THE COURT: Strike what?

MR. BLASIER: Part of the answer where he talked about what his partner
told him.

THE COURT: What his partner said, that's stricken.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) You had your flashlight on as you approached the
rear gate?

A. Yes.

Q. And you indicated that you observed blood on different portions of
the gate at that time?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you shine your flashlight?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell us where on the rear gate the blood was located when
you observed it with your flashlight?

A. I observed what looked like a smear on the top and a couple drops
on the bottom, and a smear on the ledge.

Q. And can you describe the appearance of that blood you saw in those
different places?

A. Appeared to be fresh, red, consistent with the rest of the blood.

Q. Moist?

A. Yes.

Q. And you indicated that you had a discussion at that time with your
partner, Terrazas --

A. Yes.

Q. -- who was at rear gate.

As a result of that conversation, did you make any further observation
about that back gate?

A. There was blood on the grating on the outside of the gate.

Q. And can you describe that blood on the grating on the outside
appeared, also?

A. Appeared to be fresh and moist, consistent with the rest of the
blood.

Q. Red?

A. Red.

MR. KELLY: Steve, if I could see number 81, please.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, Officer, looking at that gate, do you recognize
that?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And what is that gate?

A. That's the rear of the walkway; that's the rear alley there.

Q. And that would have been as you approached that gate --

A. Right.

Q. -- down the walkway.

MR. KELLY: And now, Steve, if I could see number 82.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you recognize what appears in that photograph?

A. It appears to be the bottom rung of the gate, with blood drops on
it.

Q. Do you recognize the bottom rung of the gate being the same blood
that you observed in the early morning hours of June 13, 1994?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you observe blood in the same location in that picture that you
observed in the early morning hours of June 13, 1994?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And can you point to the blood that you observed on the gate at
that time and that place.

A. Those two spots. (Indicating.)

Q. Now, looking at that photograph, does the blood appear there the
same as it appeared that night when you observed it in the early
morning hours?

A. It appears to be in the same spot. It's obviously dry.

MR. KELLY: 142, Steve.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, do you recognize that photograph?

A. That's the top of the gate, with a blood smear.

Q. Is that on the inside?

A. Yes.

Q. And is that -- does that blood smear appear in that photograph
there the same way it was the early morning hours of June 13, 1994?

A. Yes.

Q. In the same location?

A. Yes.

Q. Does it physically appear the same, though?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. Okay. Was it red in color?

A. It was red there. It was just a smear.

MR. KELLY: Number 85, Steve.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you recognize that as being the outside of the
same gate at 875 South Bundy?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And is that the gate that Officer Terrazas brought your attention
to?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And after him drawing your attention to that rear gate, did
you make an observation?

A. There's blood on the grating.

Q. Do you recall approximately what location that was in?

A. It was towards the bottom, middle.

Q. Would you indicate with your pointer approximately where it was.

MR. KELLY: And number 86, please, Steve.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you recognize that photograph, Officer?

A. Yes.

A. That's blood on the grating.

Q. Does that physically appear the same in that photograph as it was
when you saw in the early morning hours of June 13, 1994?

Q. Even the color and the texture?

A. No. It appears to be dry in this picture.

Q. Was it dry when you observed it that morning?

A. No; it was fresh, red, appeared to be moist.

Q. Now, after making those observations -- by the way, did you shine
your flashlight on those various portions of the blood on the gate we
just discussed?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Police Officer Terrazas also put a flashlight on those areas,
too?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. And did you observe those areas at the same time?

A. As he directed my attention to it, yes.

Q. After making those observations on the rear gate, what, if
anything, did you do next?

A. I told my partner that we were going to bring the kids out the
garage, and I asked him if it would disturb any evidence if we opened
the garage. And he said no.

Q. Did you actually walk over to look at the garage door when you
could bring them out?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Did you make any other observations in the garage door vicinity
before bringing the children out?

A. He just told me there was blood on the driveway. And I told him to
stay away from it.

Q. Did you actually go and look at the blood at that time?

A. No.

Q. Did you see any vehicles in the area?

A. Not at that time.

Q. After being told about the blood in the driveway by Police Officer
Terrazas, what, if anything, did you do next?

A. I went back in the residence. I went eastbound on the walkway and
through the front door.

Q. When you say "eastbound on the walkway," was that the same walkway
with the bloody footprints and blood drops that you had observed
earlier?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you take measures to avoid those footprints and drops?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did anybody accompany you back to that walkway at that time?

A. No.

Q. And when you went to the house, did you enter the house alone at
that time, also?

A. Yes.

Q. And who, if anybody, was in the house when you entered at that
time?

A. Officer Walsh was up by the children's bedroom.

Q. Nobody else had come in through that front area of the crime scene
at this time, had they?

A. No.

Q. You went up with Officer Wally, back in the house, at this time?

A. Yes.

Q. What, if anything, did you do next, after you went up with him?

A. We woke up the female and had her get dressed. Then we woke up the
little boy and had him get dressed. Then we went out through the
garage.

Q. And how long did it take you to, first of all, wake up the little
girl and get her dressed?

A. Just a few minutes.

Q. And she was asleep --

A. Yes.

Q. -- when you first went in there.

And then you went and woke up the little boy?

A. Right.

Q. And was the little girl with you when you did that?

A. Yes.

Q. And did she assist you in any way with the little boy?

A. She helped us get him dressed. He was kind of upset.

Q. And after you had them woke up and dressed, what, if anything, did
you do next?

A. Went down, out through the garage, and we went down the alley and
met up with another officer.

Q. And who were those officers that you met up with?

A. Officers Heider and Vasquez.

Q. And you turned the children over to them?

A. Yes.

Q. And what was your understanding as to where they were taking the
children?

A. To the police station.

Q. What did you do next, Officer, after you had the children taken to
the police station?

A. I went back to the driveway area and I saw the blood my partner was
referring to, and I saw the door of the vehicle in the driveway, the
jeep, to be ajar.

Q. First of all, the blood that you observed that Terrazas pointed you
to, did you put your flashlight on it at that time?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you make any observations, or could you describe the blood as
you saw it at that time?

A. It just appeared to be a fresh, red spot of blood.

Q. Was it consistent with the drops you had seen earlier in the
walkway?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. What, if anything, did you do next, Officer?

A. Then I went to the front of 875 South Bundy and I met with Sergeant
Coon.

Q. That was after going up and down the alleyway?

A. That was before.

Q. And Sergeant Coon -- did you receive any other instructions?

A. Sergeant Rossi arrived, and we showed him the crime scene in the
front; then we went around the back.

Q. First of all, who is Sergeant Rossi?

A. He was a watch commander at West L.A.

Q. Do you know approximately what time it was that he arrived?

A. No.

Q. When you say you showed him the crime scene in front, first of all,
what did you actually show him?

A. We went up on the grassy area, and I pointed out the female, and
the male, and the envelope, and the glove, and the hat.

Q. When you say you pointed out, in what manner did you point out to
Sergeant Rossi?

A. I illuminated it with my flashlight.

Q. And in illuminating these items, did you have occasion to
illuminate the areas -- items in the vicinity of that area, also?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you observe any other items in the immediate vicinity at this
time --

A. No.

Q. -- inside the gated area?

A. No.

Q. Anywhere outside the gated area?

A. No.

Q. Did you look with your flashlight?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, after showing Sergeant Rossi the front crime-scene area, what,
if anything, did you do?

A. We walked down to Dorothy and went to the rear alley. Then we went
up to the rear driveway, showed them the blood and the door that was
ajar to the vehicle, and the rear gate.

Q. When you say the blood, first of all, you're referring to the drop
of blood you observed in the driveway?

A. Yes.

Q. And what, if anything, did you show him when you went to the rear
gate?

A. Showed him the blood on the outside and on the inside of the rear
gate.

Q. And you showed him all the drops that you pointed out earlier to
the jury?

A. Yes.

Q. And who else was there, if anybody, with you and Sergeant Rossi at
that time?

A. I believe Sergeant Coon was there, and my partner, Officer Terrazas
was there.

Q. Now, after making these observations with Sergeant Rossi, what, if
anything, did you do next?

A. Sergeant Rossi and I went down on the walkway, approximately
halfway to where the footprints ended, and I just showed them to him.
Then we went back out to the alley.

Q. I assume you were careful not to disturb the footprints of blood?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Did you take measures to avoid the footsteps and
drops of blood at that time?

A. Yes.

Q. And Officer Rossi, also?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you then exit the rear gate?

A. Yes.

Q. After exiting with Sergeant Rossi, what, if anything, did do you
next?

A. Went back up to the front and just waited for the detectives.

Q. And did there come a time that detectives arrived there?

A. Yes.

Q. And would you be able to -- first of all, when you went back out
front with Sergeant Rossi, could you tell me at this time whether any
other police officers had arrived on the scene?

A. Yes.

Q. And could you tell me which officers had arrived there at that
time, when you went back out front with Sergeant Rossi?

A. Officer Ashton and his partner, Officer Gonzalez, Officer Goriossi,
and Seigler, Officers Sanchez and Cummings.

Q. Okay. Officers Heidler and Vasquez had been there, also?

A. They had been there to pick up the children, that was it.

Q. Okay. And I believe you indicated Sergeants Rossi and Coon were
there, also, as well as you and your partner, Terrazas?

A. Right.

Q. So it would be fair to say that at that point when you returned out
front, there had been approximately 14 police officers at the scene at
that time?

A. Right.

Q. And on more than one occasion, with other officers, you had
approached the front area of 875 South Bundy and illuminated the
entire area?

A. Yes.

Q. And that you had also approached the walkway north of 875 Bundy at
the gated area, and illuminated that entire area, also, correct?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Counsel, let the witness testify.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) You indicated that you arrived at the front of 875
South Bundy with Sergeant Rossi, awaiting the arrival of the
detectives.

A. Right.

A. Yes.

Q. Approximately how long after you had first arrived on that scene
did detectives arrive to South Bundy?

A. Possibly two hours.

Q. And which detectives arrived at that time?

A. Phillips and Fuhrman.

A. Right.

Q. And what was Detective Phillips' position at that time?

A. He's the lead homicide detective for West L.A.

Q. And Detective Fuhrman was?

A. His partner.

Q. And what, if anything, did you do upon their arrival there at the
scene, at that time?

A. Briefly went over what we had, and took them up to the front of the
crime scene, showed them that -- took them around to the north side to
show them Mr. Goldman's body and the pager, and we went

around the rear alley.

Q. When you say you showed them the front of the crime scene, how did
you do that, once again?

A. Used my flashlight to illuminate the body of both victims and the
evidence.

Q. What evidence did you illuminate?

A. The envelope the glove and the hat. Then, on the north side, the
pager and Mr. Goldman's body.

Q. And did you illuminate the surrounding area, also?

A. Yes.

Q. And you said you illuminated the north side. Did you approach that
separately with Fuhrman and Phillips, also?

A. Right.

Q. And approaching the north side, outside the gated area, did you
illuminate the vicinity?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Now, did you on observe any items of evidence as you came up that
side?

A. Just a pager.

Q. Other than the pager, nothing else?

A. No.

Q. That was your second time up there with your flashlight?

A. Right.

Q. Now, you then proceeded to the rear of South Bundy?

A. That's correct.

Q. What, if anything, did you do at the rear of 875 South Bundy with
Fuhrman and Phillips?

A. Showed them the vehicle, the blood on the driveway, blood on the
gate.

Q. When you say you showed them the blood on the driveway, what manner
did you point it out to them?

Q. Was anybody else with you besides Phillips and Fuhrman?

A. Sergeant Rossi.

Q. And after pointing out the blood in the driveway, where did you go
to next?

A. To the gate, with Detective Fuhrman.

Q. And you indicated you showed them the blood on the gate at that
time?

Q. What manner did you show him the blood on the gate at that time?

A. Using my flashlight.

Q. You showed all the blood spots that we had displayed earlier?

A. On the gate, right.

Q. And while you were at the back gate with Detective Fuhrman, what,
if anything, did Sergeant Rossi and Detective Phillips do?

A. They walked approximately halfway up the walkway, to, I assume,
where the blood drops, the footsteps ended.

Q. And then what?

A. Then they came back out.

Q. And did you show the blood on the back gate to Sergeant Rossi?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And was Sergeant Phillips there also, when the blood on the back
gate was pointed out?

A. Detective Phillips.

Q. Detective Phillips?

A. Initially when I showed it to Sergeant Rossi, he wasn't. When I was
standing there with Fuhrman, he was.

Q. After they returned back to the rear gate area, Rossi and Phillips,
what, if anything, did you do next, sir?

A. Detective Phillips, Detective Fuhrman, myself, entered the house
through the garage. And we did a walk-through on the house, and we
went out on the front landing.

Q. When you first all -- when you went to do a walk-through of the
house, did you go through the entire house, as you had on the prior
occasion with Wally?

Q. And what did you do next after you were out there with your
partner?

A. Just maintained the perimeter security.

Q. And did anybody else arrive out back at any particular time while
you were on guard at the rear location and securing the area?

A. Later I saw a photographer and then Vannatter arrived later.

Q. Let's take them one at a time. First of all, when the photographer
arrived at the rear, there was an LAPD photographer at time?

A. Yes, he worked S.I.D.

Q. What does S.I.D. stand for?

A. Scientific investigation division.

Q. And what, if anything, did you say to him when you arrived?

A. I pointed out evidence, told him not to step in it or step on it.

A. The blood drop on the driveway. I believe there was some change and
that's about it.

Q. Okay. Other than that evidence, did you point anything else out to
him?

A. No. I told him about the ice cream in the house, just to be
careful, not to knock it over if he went in.

Q. Other than that, anything else?

A. No.

Q. Was it your duty to work with the photographer or point out
evidence for him to photograph in any way?

A. No, I just did it so he wouldn't disturb any evidence.

Lange and Vannatter arrived also?

A. Right.

Q. Did you have any conversation with them at this time?

A. No.

Q. Okay. Did you point anything out to them at this time?

A. No.

this time when you saw them in the rear?

A. I believe Detective Phillips.

Q. And did there ever come a time, in the rear, that you had a
conversation with either one of those Detectives?

A. I can't remember if it was Lange or Vannatter. I think it was Lange
told my partner I had to write out a brief statement.

Q. In terms of your observations that morning?

A. Right.

Q. And did you write out the narrative of your observations?

A. Yes.

Q. And in writing that out, is that something you would do in the
ordinary course of business?

A. Right.

Q. Is that part of your official police duties?

A. Yes.

Q. And when you wrote them out that morning, was it more or less
contemporaneous with the observations that you made that morning also?

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) In those notes, Officer, is it correct you put all
your observations down in there at that time?

really out of the ordinary.

Q. And after you met with them, what, if anything, happened next?

A. Detective Phillips gave me a phone and asked me for directions to
Rockingham and told me to call me if he needed anything.

you have occasion to see them again?

A. Little later. Possibly an hour later.

Q. Okay. And under what circumstances did you happen to see them?

A. I saw Detective Fuhrman and the photographer approaching the crime
scene and then Detective Fuhrman was pointing to the evidence and the
photographer took a picture.

Q. Do you recall what evidence Detective Fuhrman was pointing at?

A. The believe and the hat.

Q. Okay. If I could see number 92, Steve. Now, do you recognize that
photograph?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Is that the photograph you just referenced Detective Fuhrman
pointing at the glove and the hat that morning?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And you actually observed the photographer take that photograph at
that time?

A. Yes, I did.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Officer Riske, good morning?

properly?

crime scene processing?

A. Right.

Q. Did you check at all for any footprints along that dirty area
before you walked there?

A. No.

Q. How did you check?

A. With my flashlight.

Q. What was the ground area like?

Q. What did you do then?

A. I told my partner to go grab on to the witnesses so they didn't
leave.

Q. Now, where was Officer Terrazas? He was your partner, correct?

A. Yeah.

Q. Where was he when you were walking up over the bushes and looking
at the bodies?

A. He was in the grassy area to the left of the bushes.

Q. So it was at this point that you told him to go talk to the
witnesses. Which particular witnesses were you referring to?

A. The female and the male.

Q. What did you do next?

A. The second time we approached, we stepped across her body and went
towards the house.

Q. And as you went toward the house, you went up on the landing,
correct?

A. Right.

Q. And you went inside the house at that point?

A. Right.

Q. Now, before you went inside the house, you observed that the door
was more than halfway open, correct?

possible ransacking and possible blood, correct?

Q. And the phone was back in the kitchen, wasn't it?

A. It was right in the kitchen, dining room.

Q. Did you pick up the phone with your hand?

A. No. Yes.

Q. You have any blood on your hand?

A. No.

Q. Did you give any thoughts to the idea that there might be
fingerprints on the phone?

A. Sure.

Q. Did you make any effort to preserve fingerprints on the phone?

A. No.

Q. Now, from that telephone, the first call you made was to?

A. The only call I made.

Q. The only call you made was to the watch commander, right?

A. Right.

Q. And who was that?

A. Sergeant Rossi.

Q. Tell me exactly what you told him?

A. Told him we had a double homicide on Bundy and it was my belief
that Mr. Simpson was somehow involved because of the photos and the
return address on the envelope.

Q. So you told the watch commander in your first telephone call that
you thought Mr. Simpson was somehow involved?

A. Right.

Q. What did you do from there?

A. We exited the house. My partner went and grabbed onto the male and
the female and the dog. I went around to the north side and checked
Mr. Goldman to see if he was alive.

Q. When you went around to the north side, again, you're walking out
on the grassy area outside the gated area of the condo?

A. Right.

Q. Let me show you exhibit 38. It's already been introduced. Is that a
photograph of Mr. Goldman's body --

A. Yes.

Q. -- At the time you first observed him?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Now, is it your testimony then you were able to shine a light in
his eyes as well as touch his eyeball from the other side of that
metal gate?

actually, it's not a gate.

Q. Okay. The metal gate in the background?

A. That's a metal fence in the background.

Q. I'm sorry, metal back -- Let me show you this photo on the Elmo, if
you get a chance.

where the bloody shoe prints were, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And after you went into the back of the house, at what point did
you go to the front landing?

MR. KELLY: Objection.

MR. BLASIER: You went into the back of the house and where did you go?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Misstates his testimony.

THE COURT: It's a question.

THE WITNESS: I didn't enter the back of the house.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You entered the front of house with Officer Wally,
correct?

A. (Nods in the affirmative.)

Q. And at that point, did you notice anybody's shoe prints?

A. Extending past the residence, not inside the house, no.

Q. Okay. But did you notice any in the area of the bodies?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you describe the positions of those shoe prints?

A. There was a -- like a heel print on a walkway in front of her body.
Then there was footprints up the steps and westbound on the landing

(The instrument herein described was marked

for identification as Defendant's

Exhibit No. 87.)

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Defendant's Exhibit No. 87)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) I'm going to have you look at exhibit 87. That

bodies were up to the front door?

A. Yes.

Q. And can you show us with a pointer where the front door is in that
diagram?

A. No.

Q. You can't? Now, did you observe any blood drops in the area of the
bloody shoe prints in that diagram?

A. I see one before the front door but I'm not going to testify to

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you make any effort to preserve the ice cream?

A. No.

MR. KELLY: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained. What's the relevance?

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) One of your jobs on a crime scene is to preserve
it so it does not -- the crime scene does not change in such a way
that it destroys your ability to determine such things as time of
death?

MR. KELLY: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled?

THE WITNESS: It's more preservance, nothing disturbed by other people.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is one of your goals not to keep the crime scene

toward the back?

A. The house was on one side and there was a fence on the other.

Q. Is there any dirt area between the walkway and the wall on the
right wall on the north?

A. I don't recall. I don't believe so. I don't recall.

Q. Now, there was a lot of foliage in the area of where the bodies
were found and also extending along the north walkway; is there not or
wasn't there?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. KELLY: Ask the question be stricken.

THE COURT: Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you make any effort to find out who the
children's father was?

A. I think I asked her who her dad was and she told me OJ Simpson. I
didn't ask her directly, OJ Simpson, no.

MR. KELLY: Objection. Ask the answer be stricken.

THE COURT: Stricken, not relevant.

MR. BAKER: I object. Goes to state of mind of this witness.

THE COURT: That was my ruling on the objection. If you want to object
to my ruling, I don't think that's possible.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, the bedrooms, where those bedroom was
located, one of the bedrooms looked out to the back alleyway, correct?

were they?

A. No.

MR. KELLY: Could we see it, please?

MR. BLASIER: 2077 (sic).

(The instrument herein described was marked

for identification as Defendant's

Exhibit No. 2097.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) 2097. Let me write on it. And I better write
Officer Riske's name on it.

Okay. Could we put this on the Elmo, please. Can you see that diagram
very well, Officer Riske?

condominium of Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, now your testimony is that Detective Fuhrman and Detective
Phillips were shown, by you, the front area of the condominium at
about 2:20?

A. Right.

Q. Could we write a 2:20?

(Steve complies.)

Again, you showed them the same path that you took up the grass and
along the side of the walkway?

A. Yeah.

Q. Up the grass area?

A. Went up the grass area and went up the north side by Mr. Goldman's
body.

Q. Let's put an F1. Yeah. Draw a line down. F1 at 2:20 AM. And
approximately how long did that take?

A. Five or ten minutes.

Q. And where did Detective Phillips and Fuhrman go from there?

A. We walked down Bundy, westbound on Dorothy to the rear of the -- up
the alley to the rear driveway.

Q. So this would be all the way around the block, in essence, to the
back of the condominium, correct?

A. I wouldn't say around the block, no.

Q. Well?

A. Down to Dorothy, mid block up the alley.

Q. Okay. Then when you got to the alley, what did Detective Fuhrman
do?

A. He walked with me and Detective Phillips to the rear driveway,
showed him the jeep, the blood on the driveway, the change and then we
went to the rear gate.

Q. Now, when you went to the rear gate, you went to the rear gate with
Detective Fuhrman?

A. Detective Fuhrman, Detective Phillips and Detective Ross.

Q. What time was that?

A. It was probably 2:35 or so.

Q. Okay.

A. 2:40.

Q. So you're back in the driveway area?

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I'm going to object to any times being placed
in the diagram. It's, in affect, placing testimony on an exhibit.

THE COURT: It's his exhibit. Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let's draw an F2 there. And I'm sorry, the time
estimate was what, 2:35, 2:40?

A. 2:40, 2:35.

Q. 2:35 to 2:40.

And what happened after that?

A. Detective Fuhrman and I stopped at the rear gate and Detective
Phillips and Sergeant Rossi continued on midway down the path.

Q. So Detective Fuhrman did not walk in the back walkway, the north
walkway at that time?

A. No.

Q. And did you and Detective Fuhrman wait for Phillips and Rossi to
come back?

A. Yes.

Q. And then where did you go from there?

A. Detective Phillips, Fuhrman and I entered the house through the
garage.

Q. And is that when you -- when you showed him the bottom floor?

A. Where? Right.

Q. Did you show him upstairs -- Detective Fuhrman upstairs at that
time?

A. Yes, the whole condo.

Q. And at this point you went out on the front landing?

A. Right.

Q. About what time was that? To your -- for your best approximation?

A. Maybe five to 3:00

Q. About 2:55?

A. It's only a guess, yes.

Q. And so let's put an F3 by the front landing.

Now, in this diagram, where I'm pointing, it's actually the front
door, correct?

A. It's actually a little south of your finger.

Q. Okay. The front door is not right at the front of the condominium,
is it?

A. No.

Q. The living room area extends out more toward the seat than the
front door?

A. Right.

Q. So the landing area where you were was how far outside the front
door?

A. It's probably 30 feet to the steps.

Q. Okay. You went just to the top of the steps?

A. Right.

Q. Okay. And after you went to the top of the steps, where did you and
Detective Fuhrman go?

A. Detective Fuhrman, Detective Phillips and

I stood right there on the landing.

Q. Okay. And for how long?

A. Maybe five minutes or so. Until we were advised that Detective
Spangler arrived.

Q. Who advised you of that?

A. I believe Sergeant Coon.

Q. And what did you do then?

A. We all went back through the front door. Detective Phillips and I
stayed in the kitchen and -- Detective Fuhrman and I stayed in the
kitchen and Detective Phillips actually went through the garage.

Q. So when you and Detective Fuhrman were in the kitchen, what time we
talking about?

A. Right around 3:00, I don't know.

Q. So let's put an F4 in the -- kitchen area is back in this area of
the condominium, correct?

(Indicating to exhibit.)

A. I don't know.

Q. Well it's to the --

A. It's to the rear, but --

Q. -- To the rear?

A. On this diagram I wouldn't pick it out.

Q. But there's the living room and then I walk up toward the back of
the condominium and you get to the kitchen?

A. It's a living room, dining room and then a kitchen.

Q. Okay. So you're in the kitchen. Let's put an F4. Detective Fuhrman.
And that's about what time?

A. Right around 3:00 I would guess.

Q. And how long did you stay in the kitchen with Detective Fuhrman?

A. A couple minutes. Until the Detective Phillips and Lieutenant
Spangler came back.

Q. And when Phillips and Spangler came back, which direction did they
come from?

A. Through the garage.

Q. What happened then?

A. I leave the house.

Q. What did Detective Fuhrman do?

A. He stayed with Phillips and Spangler.

Q. Now, when you left the house, when did you next see Detective
Fuhrman?

A. I really don't know, half hour.

Q. Did you see what Detective Fuhrman was doing during that half hour?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever see Detective Fuhrman walking down the north alleyway
at Bundy.

A. No.

Q. And Detective Fuhrman, this entire time, he never wore a coat,
correct?

A. I don't know.

Q. Well, you testified on direct that he was wearing slacks and a
shirt?

A. Right.

Q. Correct. But he did not have a coat on, did he?

A. No.

Q. Now, after that half hour, where did you first see Detective
Fuhrman again?

A. In the rear driveway.

Q. And what happened at that time?

A. I believe he just told me that RHD was on their way to take over.

Q. About what time is that?

A. I really don't know.

Q. How long after you had been in the kitchen? You said that you
didn't see him for about a half an hour.

A. I really didn't know, sir.

Q. So let's put an F5 back in the driveway. And it's at least, if
you're in the kitchen about :00, you said it was about a half hour
that you didn't see him. It was at least 3:30 at that point?

MR. KELLY: Objection.

THE WITNESS: I couldn't say what time it is.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. KELLY: Misstates his testimony. Argumentative. He said he doesn't
know what he said. He didn't know what time.

THE COURT: Sustained. Save it for argument.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, it was at that point that Detective Fuhrman
and Detective Phillips said that robbery homicide was on the way?

A. I believe it was just -- Detective Fuhrman told me that.

Q. What happened then?

A. I believe he went back inside. I'm not sure.

Q. Detective Fuhrman?

A. Right.

Q. And how long did he stay in inside, do you know?

A. I don't know.

Q. Did he go in there with anybody else?

A. Phillips and Spangler were already in there.

Q. Well, you said from the back driveway you saw Detective Fuhrman go
back in. Was Phillips there in the back driveway at the same time; and
Spangler?

A. No, they were in the residence.

Q. Okay. So when you got the information from Fuhrman that robbery
homicide was on its way, he was there with you in the back driveway.
Do I have that correct?

A. He came out of the garage, approached me and my partner and went
back inside.

Q. Okay. And how long did he stay inside?

A. I don't know.

Q. When did you next see him?

A. I really don't know.

Q. Did you see him again at all?

A. No, I saw him again but I don't know what the time was.

Q. Did you see the photographer taking any pictures prior to the time
that Detective Fuhrman and Phillips arrived?

A. No.

Q. When did you first notice the photographer taking pictures?

A. When I was in the rear alley.

Q. On which visit?

A. It was after Lieutenant Spangler arrived and I left the house.

Q. Okay. Before you were told about robbery homicide or after?

A. I really don't know.

Q. And where was he taking pictures?

A. He took a shot in the alley from Dorothy and then he was just
taking a couple of pictures in the rear and I told him not to step in
the evidence.

Q. It was still dark then. Still the middle of the night?

A. Right.

Q. Now at some point, Detective Fuhrman and Detective Phillips leave
the -- left the Bundy scene?

A. Right.

Q. That before or after Vannatter and Lange arrived?

A. It was after.

Q. And, in fact, when Detective Fuhrman and Detective Phillips left,
Detective Lange and Detective Vannatter left with them, correct?

A. I don't know. I didn't see them leave.

Q. After Fuhrman and Phillips left, did you see any Detectives at the
Bundy crime scene until they came back?

A. I believe there was two detectives from west L.A. I think one of
them was Roberts and I don't remember the other one. They were just
standing around.

Q. Let me -- I'm sorry?

A. They were just standing around in the street.

Q. Let me ask you about Detective Roberts, what time did he arrive?

A. I don't know.

Q. When did you first see him?

A. When I pulled my car around to the front, around. :00, 5:30, 5:25
maybe.

Q. So this is after Fuhrman and Phillips leave, correct?

A. No they approach me and my car was already in the front when they
approached me and asked for directions to Rockingham and Phillips gave
them the phone.

Q. And that was about 5:00. I'm sorry. What would you say the time
was?

A. It was around 5:30, 5:25.

Q. Okay. And who was there? Detective Roberts was, Detective Fuhrman
was, right -- there?

A. I remember seeing Roberts. Seems like he was there after they asked
me directions.

Q. Okay. And who all asked you directions?

A. I think Phillips asked me directions.

Q. Okay. And this was yours in the front area of Bundy?

A. Right.

Q. On the sidewalk? On the street? Where?

A. On the street.

Q. So back in the front area, we have Roberts and Phillips at about
5:15; is that what you said?

A. No.

Q. I'm sorry what did you say?

A. I said I parked my car out there between :25 and 5:30.

Q. Okay. That's when you saw them and were asked for directions?

A. No.

Q. When?

A. They asked for directions about 5:30. I saw Roberts after that
time.

Q. All right. So at 5:30 and you see Roberts after that?

A. Right.

Q. And you had not seen Roberts up to that time, correct?

A. No.

Q. That's correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Do you remember how Detective Roberts got there? Did you ever see a
vehicle --

A. No.

Q. -- That he came in?

Now, when you -- when you were out front, as you described, with
Phillips, Phillips asked for directions about 5:30, 5:35?

A. 5:25.

Q. 5:25, I'm sorry. That was before the picture of Fuhrman pointing at
the glove was taken, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And what time was the picture of Fuhrman pointing at the glove
taken? Your best approximation?

A. Between 6:30 and 6:45, maybe.

Q. And where were you when you saw that?

A. Standing on the street directly in front of the residence.

Q. And where was, well -- we know where Fuhrman was standing in the
photograph. He was standing right by the body of Nicole Brown Simpson,
correct? And that was about 6:30?

A. Right.

Q. Okay. Let's write down the Roberts and Phillips in the front area?

A. I would put Roberts more towards the Bundy and Dorothy corner.

Q. But in the area of the front?

A. Pardon me?

Q. In the area of the front, when you were asked for directions,
towards Dorothy and Bundy?

A. He was down at Dorothy and Bundy.

Q. So let's put Roberts and Phillips.

MR. KELLY: Judge, I'd object. He's not even reflecting the testimony
--

THE COURT: I think --

MR. KELLY: -- The indications he's making on the diagram --

THE COURT: I don't think --

MR. BLASIER: -- I don't want to misstate anything you've said.

THE COURT: That's not very accurate.

MR. BLASIER: Okay. Tell me again what time Roberts --

THE COURT: I think the complaint that you're drawing on it, on a
diagram that has nothing to do with where Roberts was --

MR. BLASIER: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, at about 6:30, :35 is when the pointing
picture was taken?

A. Right.

Q. The picture of Fuhrman pointing at the glove, right?

A. Right.

Q. Who else was in that general area when that picture was taken, if
anybody?

A. A photographer.

Q. Anyone else?

A. No.

MR. BLASIER: May I have a minute, Your Honor?

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now at the time that picture was taken with Mark
Fuhrman pointing at the glove, it was daylight; wasn't it?

A. No.

Q. How dark was it?

A. It was like dawn, just becoming dawn. Just started to get light.

Q. Did you still need to use flashlights?

A. Kind of subjective. I mean, to stand on the street to look for
evidence, probably.

Q. You could see clearly, Detective Fuhrman, from your advantage point
out in front, you could see Detective Fuhrman clearly pointing at the
glove and the picture being taken, correct?

A. Um-hum.

Q. You didn't need a flashlight for that?

A. No.

Q. Now, when did officer Spangler arrive?

A. Lieutenant Spangler.

Q. Lieutenant Spangler?

A. Prior. Possibly 3 o'clock when we went back in the house.

Q. And where were you when you first saw Lieutenant Spangler?

A. In the kitchen with Detective Fuhrman.

Q. And how did -- where was he when you saw him?

A. Coming in the house with Detective Phillips.

Q. Coming in the front of the house or the back?

A. The back.

Q. The back. When the picture of Detective Fuhrman pointing at the
glove was taken, where was the blood on the sidewalk? How far down the
sidewalk had it gone?

A. Maybe to the north west or the north south sidewalk, where they
meet.

Q. Where the sidewalk in front of that more or less the street that
meets the sidewalk that goes up to the condominium?

A. Right.

Q. Thank you. That's all I have.

MR. KELLY: Just a couple questions, Your Honor reflex.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. Officer, the diagram that was up there, before Mr. Blasier entered,
a number of times, with arrows pointing there --

A. Um-hum.

Q. -- Were you keeping a log of your own activities that night?

A. No.

Q. Constantly checking your watch? The times are written up there.
Were they just approximations of yours?

Q. Even though you know whether they were accurate approximations or
not?

(The instrument herein described was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 85.)

A. It appears to be the rear gate that would be leading to the rear of
the residence towards the alleyway.

Q. In other words, that would be a photo of the rear gate standing
within the residence or outside the residence looking towards the
residence?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Can you put on the board, please, exhibit .

(Steve complies.)

(The instrument herein described was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 81.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you describe, what is exhibits 81?

A. It's the rearview of the residence leading to the alleyway. And as
you're looking at it, you would be standing inside the residence
walkway looking west.

Q. So it would be the opposite direction of the rear gate photo we say
a few minutes ago?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, can you tell us whether or not that photo accurately depicts
what you saw the early morning hours of June 13 with the exception of
the markers at the bottom of the gate?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. Were those marks there when you saw the gate?

A. No, sir.

Q. Were they, to the best of your knowledge, at some later date, put
on when this actual picture was taken?

A. I believe so.

Q. You were not there when a picture was taken?

A. No, sir.

Q. Would you put 82 on the board, please?

(Steve complies.)

Did you see any blood on the inside of the back gate that those early
morning hours on June ?

A. Yes, I did sir.

Q. We've placed before you what's been marked 82. And could you tell
us whether or not, with the exception of the markers, that photograph
accurately depicts a gate as you recall it in the morning hours of
June 13, 1994?

A. Yes, sir it does.

Q. Where did you remember -- what are -- what do you remember seeing
on the bottom of the gate?

A. Towards the bottom of the gate I remember seeing some blood. On the
mesh portion right along inside here and along the bottom bar, the
gate up in this area.

Q. Now, when you say along the bottom bar of the gate, that 115
marker, was that there that evening?

A. No, sir.

Q. Could you point just to the left as you look at the photo of the
115 marker and tell us whether or not what's depicted there is what
you recall on June 13?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: A drop of blood I observed.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You were making -- I'm sorry to interrupt, you
were making a circle. I just want, for the record, where were you
making a circle?

A. By the No. 115.

Q. And you were circling, can you explain what you were circling?

A. It's a -- well, it's a drop of blood with another drop of blood.
Adjacent to it, several spots of blood along that bar right in here.
But the one I really remember well was the big drop of blood right in
here.

Q. And do you recall seeing any other blood on the lower running of
the back gate that's depicted in that photo?

A. Yes, I remember seeing the blood right along in here.

Q. When you say right along in here; is there a marker there now?

A. Marker No. 116.

Q. And you recall seeing that when?

A. June 13, 1994.

Q. Now, will you put up on the board, please, 142.

(Steve complies.)

(The instrument herein described was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 142)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) We have on the board what's been marked 142. Can
you tell us whether or not you recognize what's depicted on that
photo?

A. Yes, I recognize it. That's the smudged blood along the top bar of
the gate.

Q. Was there ever a time when you saw that smudge that you just
described?

A. Yes, I saw it on June 13, 1994, sir.

Q. Approximately?

A. Approximately 12:35 in the morning.

Q. From your time with the LAPD, are you familiar with what blood
looks like?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. How so, what, in your P.D. experiences made you familiar with the
blood?

A. I've been to numerous calls with victims of crime where there have
been bleeding and I have seen it along the ground or on different
objects and recognize it to be blood, sir.

Q. Any question in your mind that what you described to the jury here
this morning on the side of the gate, looking from east to west and
then again on the side looking from west to east, all those spots were
blood that you observed in the early morning hours of June 13?

A. It most definitely looked like blood to me, sir.

Q. And from your observation, how did they look, again, in terms of --

A. It was --

Q. -- Appearance

A. Bright red in color. Some appeared to be moist or wet looking.

Q. Did you prepare any notes in the early morning hours of June 13
just generally summarize your observations?

A. Yes, I did, sir.

Q. Make any notes of any blood you saw on the back gate?

A. Yes, I did sir.

Q. One last question, Officer Terrazas. In all your time there at
Bundy, all your time in the rear and all the shining of your
flashlight that you told us about, did you ever see a second glove?

A. No, sir.

Q. Thank you very much.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Officer Terrazas, what was the temperature out that night on the
13th?

A. I don't know what the temperature was.

Q. Around 60 degrees?

A. That would be fair to say, sir.

Q. And the let me go back. Just a minute, you suggested that when you
got there, you walked up the left side of the walkway towards the
front of the house, correct, with your partner?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you both shined your flashlight in the area and you saw the
body of Ron Goldman, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You also saw the glove, you saw the hat, it's a knit cap, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And the scene was awash in blood; was it not?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And the blood that it was washed in went all the way from when you
first observe the blood you were -- Strike that. When you first
observed the scene, you were down by the sidewalk, correct?

A. That's correct, sir.

Q. And you looked up there and you saw the body of the of Nicole Brown
Simpson up by the steps?

A. That's correct.

Q. Didn't have any problem observing that, did you?

A. No, sir.

Q. It was light enough for you to see it?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then, the blood that was from Nicole Brown Simpson or from the
murders, if you will, went all the way down the trial walkway in the
grout of that trial walkway to the sidewalk, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And there was -- from where you were standing in front of walkway,
there was -- blood went all across the sidewalk, right?

A. That's correct, sir.

Q. And there was paw prints that went south on -- on Bundy, correct?

A. That's correct sir.

Q. And after, in fact, when you saw it, you thought that this was a
river of blood coming down from the body of Nicole Brown Simpson down
to the sidewalk, true?

A. That's correct, sir.

Q. Was it -- it was an enormous amount, true?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay. And then you and your partner, Officer Riske, he was standing
there observing exactly what you were observing as far as you could
tell?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusion.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) He was standing there around -- you were both
looking up the walkway towards the body of Nicole Brown Simpson true?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then what you did is you then went to the left of the walkway
because you didn't want to disturb the blood that was coming down the
walkway and that's why you walked in the foliage to the left, correct?

A. That's correct, sir.

Q. And as you went up the walkway, you then shined your lights over to
the right or to the north and saw the evidence that you've described,
true?

A. No, sir. I never saw the evidence --

Q. Okay.

A. -- From the foliage area, I never saw from there.

Q. Okay. Now, as you got towards the house, did you go all the way up
to the gate, the gated area I'm talking about the first time that you
went towards the house if you done understand my questions he?

A. I don't understand sir.

Q. Let me have -- no, it's 89 I believe. . Pill.

MR. P. BAKER: 81. That's it.

MR. BAKER: Now, can everybody see that? Can you focus that any better?
It's really bad.

MR. P. BAKER: That's about as good as I can get it.

MR. BAKER: That's a little better, thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, when you and Officer Riske arrived and after
you were informed about the fact there was a person across the street
at 875, that's what occurred; isn't it? Not, you went across, answered
a call at 874?

A. Yes, sir a prowler suspect now called there, sir.

Q. And you had some communication with a man and a woman on woman who
had a dog on a leash, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then you crossed. Your car was parked on the east side. Your
black and white unit was parked on the east sides of --

A. That's correct.

Q. -- Of Bundy?

A. That's correct, sir.

Q. You walked across the street on the east side of Bundy to the west
side of Bundy; is that true?

A. That's correct.

Q. Is that true, you walked up the walkway, correct?

A. That's correct, sir.

Q. You looked up the walkway before you ever set foot on the sidewalk
because there was blood on it, correct?

A. To the best of my recollection, yes, sir.

Q. And then you what you see depicted -- is this 32?

MR. P. BAKER: Yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) What you see depicted in , that's a representation
of the scene that you saw when you arrived?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And the blood was trailing down through the grout and trial, threw?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And there were prints of blood in the front of the walkway area,
correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you and your partner, to be careful not to contaminate the
scene or to destroy evidence, walked up through the area of the plants
on the left of exhibit 32; is that correct?

A. We were very careful, sir.

Q. But regardless of your degree of being careful, sir, you walked on
the plants that we see on the left side of 32; is that right?

A. Yes, sir. I walk on this area. It would be more towards the left.

Q. Okay. And you got up to the area. Did you, after you had got up
towards the gate, did you then -- did you then gone into the house?

A. Sir, I walked up to the foliage. My partner then walked over and in
went into that gated area as I stood by on the foliage.

Q. Did you ever, on the night of June 13, , go into the condominium
ever?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you ever follow Officer Riske into the kitchen to use the phone
in the condominium?

A. No, sir.

MR. BAKER: Is this a good place, Your Honor?

THE COURT: It is. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, 1:30.

Don't talk about the case. Don't form or express any opinions.

See you at 1:30.

(At 12:00 P.M. a recess was taken until Monday,

SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA MONDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1996 1:40 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

MR. BLASIER: I have two exhibits I neglected to move in. I will move
them in, 1439 and the new one, 2097.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, with regard to 2097, I have two objections: One
would be, the times that were testified to were just rough
approximations and basically guesses by the witness. And secondly,
there are indications put on there, such as Detective Roberts, where
there's not even a setting or scenario in which to situate him, and
they still placed his name and time on that.

Also, I don't believe it's an accurate reflection of the geographic
area or the layout of the premises, or an accurate reflection of the
times and positions of people, as to what was testified to.

I simply agreed to the foundation basis as to the diagram itself, and
not any entries that may have been subsequently made.

MR. BLASIER: These are times he testified to.

There is no time by Roberts and Phillips -- whether there was
testimony by Roberts and Phillips at Bundy.

MR. KELLY: The last, final --

I'm sorry. Are you done?

MR. BLASIER: This is straight from the testimony.

MR. KELLY: That Officer Riske indicated that he could not even find
the kitchen on the diagram, not unless Mr. Blasier made markings and
an arrow and diagram, and set a time and situated Officer Riske in a
kitchen that he was not even able to identify or locate.

THE COURT: What was 1439?

MR. BLASIER: 1439 was a picture outside of Bundy.

THE COURT: Picture or photograph?

MR. BLASIER: 1439 --

THE COURT: 1439 is received.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 1439.)

THE COURT: 2097 is not received. You can use it in your closing
argument.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: One other issue: That's the issue, as the court is well
aware from the testimony this morning, when Officer Riske was put on
the stand, Mr. Kelly asked Officer Riske, number one, to describe his
duties, which were to identify evidence, preserve evidence. Then he
went in detail what he did to preserve the evidence. And the point
being that this jury has heard from their first witness that,
basically, the LAPD collected all the evidence and preserved all the
evidence and preserved the crime scene.

Our view is, obviously, LAPD did not collect all of the evidence. LAPD
did not preserve the evidence. And this is what we went into in detail
vis a vis the opening statements. And you allowed me to do that after
Mr. Petrocelli objected. And I think the Karush case, or whatever it
is, is patently different than what you're talking about. We're not
talking about different types of techniques; we're talking about what
they have set forth in both in their opening statement and here in
their first witness, that the LAPD did their job. And basically, the
tenor is, there's only one suspect: That's my client.

We're saying the LAPD did not do their job relative to the evidence.
And every time there's an objection, the Court sustains it. And so I
wanted to get a ruling relative to that, because we're not talking
about collection techniques; we're talking about the absence of
collection after they identified and photographed evidence at the
crime scene.

And we need this. This is relevant for two theories. It's relevant,
one, the theory that they say LAPD did everything great and they
protected the crime scene; they collected all of the relevant
evidence; and there's only one suspect: That's Mr. Simpson.

We say LAPD did not do everything great. They did not collect all the
evidence. And the reason there was only one suspect is because of what
they didn't do, perhaps, but that's for our argument. That's to be
implied as circumstantial evidence.

But I certainly wanted to get the Court's ruling before we went
further, in view of what was a and wasn't a motion or anything else.
It was just a brief relative to the questioning of witnesses and then
the Court sustaining objections. So I wanted to get that cleared up
before I went further with Mr. Terrazas, and very definitely before we
go further into this case, sir.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, with regard to the questioning of Police
Officer Riske, his testimony was, he was there to identify and
preserve the evidence only, and offered absolutely no testimony as to
the collection of evidence or any other procedures involved, and
further investigation of the evidence or processing of it. He just
basically said, I was there to preserve it and make sure it was not
disturbed. And his testimony went no further than that.

MR. BAKER: He said he identified it. I'm sorry; I apologize.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, the position we had argued when we filed
the motion originally is simply that evidence that is not collected is
not relevant because they can't tie it in any way to the case. What's
relevant is the integrity of the evidence that was collected and
whether that evidence tends to identify or not identify Mr. Simpson.

But all of the things that were not done and that might have been
done, don't tell us anything, and they consume undue time; they're
confusing to the jury, and indeed could well be prejudicial.

MR. BAKER: Respectfully, I think they tell us a lot. They tell us
about a rush to judgment; they tell us an awful lot about what was
being done by the LAPD and what was not being done. These people stand
exactly in the shadows of the LAPD.

THE COURT: I don't think so.

MR. BAKER: Well --

THE COURT: The Court, at the outset, had made a ruling; and that was
on September 17. And essentially, the ruling is this: The plaintiff
has the burden of proving that the defendant, and based on part of the
evidence that they are offering, was a person who committed the acts
resulting in the deaths.

This is not a case of the defendant defending against a criminal
accusation by showing the shortcomings in any of the police
investigations, as to raise a reasonable as to the police officers;
this is not a case against the Los Angeles Police Department for, as I
said before, committing malpractice. It's not a case where the
defendant is suing LAPD for not pursuing evidence that would have
proved his innocence.

The only issue in this case, really, is whether or not the evidence
that is being offered by the plaintiff has proper foundation, and
whether or not the evidence supports the plaintiffs' position with
regards to connecting the defendant with the offense.

Whether or not the police department did or did not act within certain
protocols of police investigation or not, other than the fact that if
they spoiled some evidence or affected it, the evidence of the case,
some of the evidence being offered, all their shortcomings, in the
Court's opinion, do not go to the issue of efficacy of plaintiffs'
evidence, and I am going to continue to sustain objections thereon.

MR. BAKER: So I'm clear, in terms, Your Honor called this a civil
murder case, all the evidence they're putting on.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, I'm not married to any term that I may have used
at one point or another.

MR. BAKER: Well, when they identify evidence, are you telling us that
they identify evidence by photograph?

In other words, as this Court is fully aware, they have a duty to
recognize, and as Officer Riske indicated, to I.D. evidence and
preserve that evidence.

If it's I.D.'d and preserved and then lost, I assume we get to talk
about that.

THE COURT: I agree.

MR. BAKER: Okay. Thank you.

THE COURT: All right. The only thing I am saying, Mr. Baker, is that
you're not going to be able to talk about the evidence that they
didn't find or failed to find.

MR. BAKER: Okay, fine.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BAKER: I wanted to be clear on that. Thank you, sir.

THE COURT: All right. Bring the jury in.

For the record, let me say the reason I would allow it is because it
goes to the weight of the evidence.

MR. BAKER: Okay. Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, just so we don't interrupt any examination
with unnecessary objections, as I understand it, the evidence that Mr.
Baker can freely question concerning the evidence that we are offering
to prove the defendant's guilt, the physical evidence that we are
offering, but not with respect to other evidence that was not
collected and not used at all.

THE COURT: That's correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. We're talking about two different things
here, Judge. I want to be clear on it. Let's get very specific.

They documented -- that is, the LAPD documented -- and there will be
testimony that the coroner was asked to take the blood off of Nicole's
back because that blood could not have been the victim's blood.

By the way, she was lying.

That was never done. That blood was destroyed. We will never know
where that blood went to.

There was a triangular piece of plain paper that existed in the
photographs by the envelope that is of some significance, according to
the criminalist that we have retained, and indeed the criminalist they
have retained says that's evidence that should have been -- it was
documented by the photograph -- should have been collected; it should
have been preserved.

It never was preserved; it never was collected. If it was, it was lost
subsequently.

We've got the lens, two lenses in the glasses. Those two lenses were
checked. Those two lenses went to LAPD's I.D. There is now one lens.

That's the type of evidence we're talking about that goes to the
weight, as you say.

THE COURT: No, I don't think so. That's the kind of evidence that's
not coming in because it's not being offered. It has to have probative
value. The fact that it's no longer here has no probative value as to
--

MR. BAKER: -- It does have probative value to rushing to judgment. You
can't cherry-pick the evidence you want, and that's what LAPD did.

THE COURT: I'm going to stand by my rulings.

Bring the jury in.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE CLERK: You are still under oath.

Would you state your name again for the record.

THE WITNESS: First Miguel, M-I-G-U-E-L, last name Terrazas,
T-E-R-R-A-Z-A-S.

MIGUEL TERRAZAS, previously sworn, resumed the stand and testified
further as follows:

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Officer Terrazas, I think at the noon break, we were talking about
you had gone, walked towards the victim westbound, and you had viewed
the victim at that point in time, correct?

This is your initial viewing of the victim at around 12:20 in the
morning on the 13th?

A. Yes. As I crossed the shrubbery and crossed over the victim, I
observed the victim number .

Q. Okay. So now, on June 13, 1994, you made a -- gave a written
statement that you signed about :20 in the morning; is that right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you made that, I take it, after the events of the evening were
relatively fresh in your mind, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And let me see if I can -- and we'll substitute -- you've agreed
with Mr. Medvene, we'll substitute in a better copy; this one we've
marked all up. But for lack of one, that is, in fact, the statement
that you gave, is it not, sir?

A. Yes, sir, it's a copy of my statement.

Q. And everything in that statement is true and correct, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay. Now, you say, "I walked to the above address and saw victim
number 1 lying at the base of the stairwell, facing northbound. Upon
seeing victim number 1, I walked toward her, westbound on the walkway,
and observed victim number 2 lying in the bushes, just north of victim
No. 1."

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you or did you not walk on the walkway?

A. Yes, sir, I walked on the walkway as I crossed over here, sir.
That's the walkway.

Q. All right. And then you indicated that after you walked over victim
number 1, you saw the door to 875 South Bundy wide open, correct?

A. Yes, sir. As I walked over victim number and I climbed the stairs,
I saw the door open, open. Yes, sir.

Q. You climbed the stairs?

A. Well, yes, sir. As I walked on the stairs, onto the base of the
stairs to the top of the stairs, I saw --

Q. Let me see if I've got this right:

MR. BAKER: You want to put up here -- I guess I have it.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, may we have an exhibit number for
the document that the --

MR. BAKER: Did you get it, 1439?

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you.

THE COURT: Is that the best you can do?

MR. BAKER: That's awful. Try 36.

It's still off. Try 36.

(Exhibit 36 being displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, as I understand in your testimony, you walked
up westbound -- and we are looking due west -- that picture is looking
due west, is it not?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You walked up westbound to the area where the front gate is; then
you crossed over. You say you walk on the walkway by stepping over
victim number 1, Ms. Nicole Brown Simpson?

A. I believe there was some grass in the area. I walked over here,
crossed over, crossed over the shrubbery over the foliage up to here,
and came up westbound on the walkway right here.

Q. So, you went up the steps?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And how far up the steps did you go?

A. Well, sir, I walked to the front door, so I walked all the way on
top of the steps, sir.

Q. And how far was the front door from the top of that landing of the
steps that we can see in Exhibit 36?

A. Not very good with measurements. I'd say approximately 10, 15 feet,
maybe.

Q. Okay. And was the front door right at the beginning of the house or
the condo?

A. To the best of my recollection, it's close to the entrance, sir.
It's not that far.

Q. In other words, if you walk up the steps, your recollection is that
the front door would be to the left, at the beginning of the building?

A. Approximately about 10 to 15 from the base of the stairwell, sir.

Q. All right. And --

A. To the top.

Q. And the entrance, then, is kind of on -- the door is on an angle,
as I recall; is that right?

A. As I recall, no; it just sits --

Q. Flush on the front of the --

A. As I recall it, yes, sir.

Q. Okay. And did you go in the house?

A. No, sir.

Q. And was Officer Riske with you at that time?

A. Yes, he was.

Q. And did he go into the house at that time?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. And why is it you didn't go in with him?

A. I was just there -- I wanted to ensure no one came up behind me via
the walkway from the west end, or anybody came in from the other side
of the house, meaning from the west side, from the inside. I just
stood by the doorway, sir.

Q. I see. So, now, the situation that you had when you approached that
condominium at about :25, now, is that you have two extremely bloody
murders and homicide victims out in the front, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you have no idea what's in the house, right?

A. I have no idea.

Q. And your partner has no idea what's in the house, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusion.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you talk to your partner about whether or not he
had any idea about what was going on inside there?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did either of you have your service revolvers drawn?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you?

A. Yes.

Q. Did he?

A. I don't remember.

Q. And so you -- he walked into the house and you then returned to
your vehicle?

A. He walked into the -- he walked into the house as I stood in
doorway. He walked in to use the telephone. He walked right back out.
As he walked out, I walked back down the stairwell, observed victim
number 2, the male.

I then put my light on the envelope, the glove, and the cap. I
continued to put the light back on the walkway, walked on the walkway,
and took the same route I pointed out, which would be crossed over
here onto the shrubbery, and back out through the foliage.

Q. All right. Now, you didn't actually see your partner use the phone,
did you?

A. I believe I did, sir, to the best of my recollection. Yes, I did; I
saw him use the phone.

Q. So from the entrance way, in the house, you could visualize him on
the phone, and you remember what room he was in when you used the
phone?

A. As I poked my head into the door, into the residence, I saw him at
the kitchen, sir. I believe he was -- the phone was located near a --
a bar or some kind of table.

Q. Okay. And your recollection is, of course, you never stepped in the
house and you had full view of that telephone from the entrance where
you were, right?

A. I'm not saying I had a full few, sir. I observed my partner using
the phone. I didn't have a full view of the telephone itself.

Q. Let me ask you: When you looked -- when you peeked your head in the
door, could you look through into the kitchen area?

A. To the best of my recollection, yes, sir.

Q. Okay. And could you see the instrument called a telephone, Officer
Terrazas?

A. I saw the hand portion, where you talk into. That is the portion I
saw as he was using it, to the best of my recollection, sir.

Q. So at the time you looked into the front door, your partner was on
the phone; is that right?

A. To the best of my recollection, yes, sir.

Q. Now, did you walk up the stairwell -- the stairs onto that landing
with him?

A. I don't understand, sir.

Q. Poor question. I apologize. You both walked across, towards where
the body of Nicole Brown Simpson was, and went up the stairs?

A. Yes.

Q. He was in the lead?

A. He went ahead of me, sir. Approximately, maybe ten seconds later, I
followed, sir, behind him. If that, ten seconds.

Q. And in that ten seconds, what did you do? He led in or was just --

A. I just stood by, sir.

Q. You've got to wait till I finish; and I'll be happy to wait until
you finish,

In that ten seconds, did you -- was that just the natural progression
of how you went into the -- up the steps and into the area?

A. It was for me, sir.

Q. All right. And then he had -- when you got up to the landing, why
did you look in the doorway and not go in?

A. Once again, sir, my concern is, I didn't want nobody to walk up
behind me or coming in westbound from the other gate area. I was
concerned with that area, as well as I was concerned that someone
could walk from inside the house from the other side, which would be
the west end of inside the house, sir.

Q. Now, did you look directly in the front door?

Did you look directly into the kitchen?

Was there another room was there, or just the kitchen area?

A. I can't remember, sir.

Q. Okay. And then your partner stayed on the phone. In a few minutes,
he came out and you both exited the condominium itself, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And you walked down the stairs and viewed the evidence that you
told us about?

A. Yes.

Q. And you viewed that same evidence, you told us when Mr. Medvene
questioned you, when you were going up there, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. So you viewed it twice?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. Then you came back and you got -- did you go to your
vehicle after that?

A. I walked up onto the shrubbery where, to the best of my
recollection, I met -- we both met with Sergeant Coon, as Sergeant
Coon arrived. He then directed me to walk to the rear of the 875 South
Bundy.

Q. Did you see your partner go around to the north side of the
property of 875 South Bundy?

A. To the north side, sir.

Q. Yes.

A. I don't understand your question as to --

Q. When you and Officer Riske exited the condominium and you walked
out towards Bundy, did you -- first of all, let me ask you this: Did
you go to your vehicle, or did you -- were you intercepted by Sergeant
Coon?

A. To the best of my recollection, sir, we were intercepted by
Sergeant Coon.

Q. Then you went directly to the back of 875 South Bundy?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you watch your partner go around to the north side of 875 South
Bundy?

A. No, sir, not that I can remember, no.

Q. Okay. Excuse me. Let me just show you what you wrote at 4:20 in the
morning on the 13th. See if I'm' reading it accurately.

"Walked over victim 2 and saw the door to South Bundy Drive wide open.

"I returned to my vehicle, where I met Sergeant" -- "met with Sergeant
Coon, and was assigned to cover the rear of the residence." Is that
correct?

A. If I walked to the vehicle, yes, sir.

Q. Well, I'm asking you, is that what you wrote in the morning hours,
4:20, on the 13th?

A. Yes, that's what I wrote, sir.

Q. Okay. And as you sit here now, you don't have any recollection of
going to your vehicle, correct?

A. I don't remember, no, sir.

Q. Okay. Fair enough. Now, you went down south on Bundy, turned right
on Dorothy, and right back up the alley?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Had it been taped by then?

A. No.

Q. And you maintained your vigil outside the rear of 875 South Bundy
in the alley, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you did that till 4:20 in the morning, when you signed and
wrote this report, true?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. And during that period of time, you saw various people
go in and out of 875 South Bundy from the rear, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. Now, first of all, when you got there, had anybody, to
your knowledge, go in 875 South Bundy from the alleyway?

A. Not from the alley, sir.

Q. All right. Now, you got there, I assume, what, about 12:40?

A. 12:35.

Q. Okay.

A. 12:40-ish. That's a good -- approximately.

Q. So you were there for three hours and 40 or so minutes, correct?

A. Approximately, sir.

Q. All right. Now, during that period of time, who was the first
person that came around to the back that you allowed to go into 875
South Bundy?

A. Through the rear, sir?

Q. Yes.

A. Believe it was Sergeant Rossi. It was Sergeant Rossi.

Q. And was Sergeant Rossi with anybody?

A. To the best of my recollection, he was -- would be my partner,
Officer Riske.

Q. Anybody else?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did anybody come out of the rear of 875 South Bundy before you
allowed Rossi and Riske to go in that --

A. Yes.

Q. -- area?

A. Yes.

Q. Who?

A. There was a -- there were the two children -- I believe it was
Officer Vasquez, if my memory serves me right, and some other officers
that had cleared the residence and found the children inside. They
walked up through the rear and put the children inside a car and into
a patrol car.

Q. That was the patrol car in the alley?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. And Officer Vasquez an the two children were the first people that
came out of that garage, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. And there is a door that leads from the garage into the
condominium -- the living area of the condominium, correct?

A. Can you repeat that, sir?

Q. Be happy to. There is a door in the garage that leads into the
living area of the condominium, right?

A. I never went inside the garage, but there must be, sir.

Q. Well, I mean you saw --

A. I saw.

Q. -- various people in three hours and forty minutes. You saw five or
ten people going in and out of there?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You saw the entrance to the residence?

A. All I knew, there was a door there. Where it went, I didn't know.

Q. Did you think it was the residence?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, in terms of when you got there at :35 or so in the morning,
that is back by the garage and the alley area, did you inspect the
area with your flashlight?

A. When I arrived to the rear of the alley, Yes, I did, sir.

Q. And you then noted some blood that you documented in your report,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And all the evidence that you noted, you documented in your report
because it was important; isn't that true?

A. Not all the evidence. I didn't annotate all the evidence in my
report.

Q. What was your report for if it was not to, number 1, indicate your
whereabouts from the time you got there, 12:35 and 2:00, to enable you
to document the evidence that you had seen?

A. Sir, my report was just a brief overview of what I had done and
what I had seen, sir.

Q. Well, did you -- you told us about some blood drops on the back
gate.

MR. BAKER: You want to put up Exhibit 82? Okay. Then you can't put it
up.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you indicated when you were being examined this
morning by Mr. Medvene, that the drop there, No. 115, you circled that
drop, did you not?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And that's this area, correct?

A. That would be this area here, sir.

Q. And 116?

A. 116 would be this area here, sir.

Q. This morning you also indicated those two dots right by the rung,
did you not?

A. Are you saying these right here, sir?

Q. Yeah.

A. I don't remember, sir.

Q. Okay. Now, do you have a recollection, as you sit her now, whether
that is looking westward or eastward on the gate. And I understand
it's a couple years ago.

A. I'm looking, I believe, at what would be looking -- as the gate lay
shut, it would be looking westward, sir.

Q. And how many drops of blood did you visualize when you were looking
for evidence at 12:35 on the evening of June 13, 1994?

A. At the gate itself, sir?

Q. Yeah, let's just keep it to the gate.

A. Overall, the total on the gate, meaning the top, the mesh, and the
bottom bar?

Q. Everything.

A. Well, the top bar had a smudge -- I consider that one smudge of
blood.

Q. Okay.

A. The lower portion on the mesh appeared to be another -- appeared to
be smudges or right in here, drops. I don't know what you want to call
it.

Q. Is that rust, Officer Terrazas, that you just put your pointer?

A. To the best of my recollection, no, sir.

Q. That's blood drops, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. All right. Go ahead.

A. Another one here.

Q. All right.

A. That would be one, two, three, four -- approximately four, sir.

Q. Okay. You want to read to the jury what you put in your report at
4:20 on the 13th relative to blood drops?

A. Yes, sir.

(Witness reviews documents.)

Q. Right at the bottom.

A. Says, "I then walked towards the" -- "towards the side gate of the
residence and observed a small blood trail leading into the residence
side walkway and a small drop of blood on the bottom portion of the
gate, facing westbound."

Q. So what you wrote on your report after you had been at the scene
for three hours and forty minutes was one small drop of blood, a small
drop of blood on the bottom portion of the gate, facing westbound
correct?

A. Sir, there was a trail of blood, meaning, i.e., the bottom, the
top, and a drop of blood on the gate itself, too sir, on the other
side, facing westbound.

Q. On the gate, Officer Terrazas, you observed and wrote on June 13,
1994, "one small drop of blood on the bottom portion of the gate
facing westbound." Yes or no?

A. Yes.

Q. Thank you. And what you say -- well, strike that.

Now, in terms of your being behind the garage and in charge of access,
that is, security to anyone entering or leaving the condominium, you
were in charge of ensuring that nobody who wasn't authorized got into
the structure, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And so, all police officers were authorized to get into the
structure, correct?

A. Not all police officers, sir.

Q. Now, if in fact the robbery/homicide division had taken over at
1:30 or so in the morning, then no one from West L.A. should be
allowed into the condominium from your vantage point; isn't that true
--

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

Q. (Continuing.) -- unless they were with robbery/homicide?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusion.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Officer Terrazas, the minute robbery/homicide
division takes over the crime scene, then all of West L.A. detectives
and West L.A. police are supposed to remain clear of the crime scene
and let robbery/homicide do it; isn't that true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusion; assumes facts not in
evidence; outside the scope.

THE COURT: Without foundation. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Do you know whether or not when the robbery/homicide
division takes over a crime scene, or says that they are taking over
authority, if that precludes West L.A. or any other unit in the valley
from exercising any authority over the crime scene?

A. At the time no one -- no one advised me that robbery/homicide had
taken over the scene, sir.

Q. Regardless of what -- I'm talking now in the abstract.

You knew on June 13, 1994, that if, in fact, robbery/homicide takes
over a crime scene, that that would then limit access to people from
robbery/homicide or whoever they desire to get into the house, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative; assumes facts not in evidence;
lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained. If he didn't know, it's irrelevant.

MR. BAKER: I think he --

THE COURT: He said he didn't know.

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry.

THE COURT: He said he did not know whether they took over; therefore,
what he thinks is irrelevant.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Officer Terrazas, are you telling us that you didn't
know in the time between :30 or 12:35, when you were put back behind
the alley, and 4:20 in the morning, when you were relieved of your
security post, you didn't know if robbery/homicide had taken over at
any time during that period of time?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Sir, the only thing I was told was that robbery/homicide had
arrived, and also West L.A. homicide had arrived. I was never told who
had taken over the crime scene, sir.

Q. When robbery/homicide takes it at a crime scene --

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, I'm going to sustain my own objection.

I think that -- let's establish that this is not the witness from
which we're going to get this information. You've got other witnesses
you can ask that of.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, after you saw Officer Riske and Officer Rossi
come in to the back alleyway portion of 875 South Bundy -- well,
strike that.

What time did they get there?

THE COURT: Who?

MR. BAKER: Riske and Rossi.

THE WITNESS: Maybe 20 to 30 minutes later, after I had arrived from
the rear area.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Okay, sometime shortly after 1 o'clock, around
there?

A. Approximately, sir.

Q. Okay. And tell me what you observed Officer Rossi and Officer Riske
do.

A. I believe I walked -- to the best of my recollection, I walked with
them and Sergeant -- I mean my partner, Officer Riske, told Sergeant
Rossi what I had been in that rear area. So Sergeant Rossi then walked
with us. And to the best of my recollection, me and Riske showed him
what we had seen.

Q. And what you had seen, you walked down the walkway on the north
side of the house, correct?

A. No, sir, I didn't walk -- are you saying I walked -- if I walked
westbound on the north walkway, sir?

Q. No. I apologize. Another poor question.

Did you or Officer Riske take Officer Rossi and go eastbound on the
walkway that borders the northern portion of the condominium?

A. Yes. As the gate was open, sir, we did walk into the walkway,
eastbound, sir, onto the north walkway, eastbound, sir.

Q. And how far did you walk, approximately?

A. Two, three feet, approximately.

Q. That's beyond the gate?

A. Two, three feet, approximately.

Q. Didn't see any footprints, did you?

A. Sir, the only footprints I saw was would be at the far east end of
the walkway, near victim number 1, which would be the female, sir. I
saw the footprints there.

Q. Did you see any footprints in the entrance by the west gate when
you were going east?

A. No, sir.

Q. Okay. And you only went a couple feet in and turned around and came
back out; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And then what did Officers Riske and Rossi do, if anything?

A. They put their flashlights on the gate and the actual walkway, the
driveway, which would be where the glove was located, also, and walked
on the side and then walked out of it.

Q. Did you see Officers Rossi and Riske go into the condominium?

A. I did not see -- I did not see Sergeant Rossi walk into the
condominium.

Q. Did you see Officer Riske walk into the condominium at or about
1:00 to 1:10 in the morning?

A. No, sir.

Q. Thereafter, when did you next see an officer go into the
condominium from the door that is at the garage and goes into, we
believe, into the house?

A. I don't remember seeing any, sir.

Q. Let me see if I can get this straight.

Between the time that you arrived there, that would be 12:35, until
you were relieved of the security at 4:20, you didn't see any officer
go into the door that goes from the garage into the living structure?

A. Sir, I saw, I believe it was Detective Fuhrman, I believe it was
Detective Phillips and Vannatter walk in, sir.

Q. All together?

A. No, sir; throughout that time frame, sir.

Q. What time did you see Detective Fuhrman go into the property?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Vague and ambiguous in terms of
"go into the property."

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) What time did you see Mark Fuhrman from your vantage
point at the rear of the property in the alley, and in the driveway
towards the garage, enter through the garage area and go into the door
that leads from the garage into the house?

A. I didn't happen to see my watch at the time. I really wouldn't know
what time it was, sir.

Q. Approximately?

A. From the time I arrived, approximately maybe 1:30, 1:45, maybe.

Q. All right. And who did Fuhrman go into the structure with, that you
visualized?

A. I can't remember, sir.

Q. Do you remember if he went in with anybody?

A. I don't remember, sir.

Q. It was important for you to know who went in and exited the house,
because you were the security in the back of the house; isn't that
true?

A. That's correct, sir.

Q. Did you see him go into the property with Ron Phillips, Detective
Phillips?

A. I remember seeing Detective Phillips at the scene, sir. I believe
he walked in, sir, because I -- but I don't remember if he walked in
with Detective Fuhrman, sir.

Q. All right. Did you ever see Officer Riske walk in from your vantage
point, from the alleyway into the door and into the living structure?

A. From the front door or from the garage, sir.

Q. It's true you never saw Riske enter from the back door and go into
the living structure; is that true?

A. Not that I can remember, sir.

Q. You have no recollection of Riske entering from the back?

A. I don't remember, sir.

Q. Now, Phillips, when -- do you remember who he entered with, if
anybody?

A. I don't remember, sir.

Q. You don't remember what time?

A. I don't, sir.

Q. Do you remember if Frank Spangler ever went in the rear entrance?

A. Who?

Q. Lieutenant Spangler.

Do you know who he is?

A. I don't remember him, sir.

Q. Now, do you remember anybody -- well, strike that.

When did you see Detective Vannatter enter the house from your vantage
point?

A. I don't remember the time. I would have to speculate, sir.

Q. Well, you did say you have an estimate, did you not?

A. It would be a really rough estimate. I don't remember looking at my
watch.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, if the witness has a memory, he can
so state, but he's not to guess.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. MEDVENE: We'd like some foundation, Your Honor, whether the
witness has a memory or he's just guessing on the time --

THE COURT: -- own statement.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) How many hours did you spend with Mr. Medvene before
you got on the stand here, after Mr. Simpson was acquitted?

A. After Mr. Simpson was acquitted?

Q. Yeah. How many hours did you spend with Mr. Medvene?

A. Maybe an hour, total.

Q. Who else did you spend time with to prepare yourself to testify
today, if anybody?

A. Who I spoke with? Just Mr. Medvene and the gentleman in the red
hair, standing directly behind Mr. Medvene.

Q. Okay. Okay. You never talked to anyone from the defense side, did
you?

A. No, sir.

Q. Now, what's your best estimate, sir, as to when Mr. Phillip
Vannatter entered the house from the rear?

A. I would be -- strictly guessing, it would be sometime between maybe
2:00 and 3:00, sir.

Q. Well, do you have a sense, as you sit here now, since it was your
job to ensure the security of that area, whether Detective Vannatter
entered the property with anybody else?

A. Yes, sir. If I saw identification on the individual, sir. And with
Detective Vannatter, I assume he was to go inside, sir.

Q. Had you ever met Detective Vannatter before this time?

A. No, sir.

Q. So Detective Vannatter showed you I.D.; then you let anybody he
wanted, or anybody who had I.D., in with him?

A. Yes, if he was a detective; yes, sir.

Q. Do you know who went in with Detective Vannatter?

A. I have no idea, sir.

Q. Do you have a recollection, as you sit here now, of anybody else
other than Detectives Vannatter, Fuhrman, and Phillips going in the
back of the house and entering the structure from your vantage point?

A. From what I can remember, sir, no, sir.

Q. All right. Now, did you -- when you viewed the gloves, did you note
their location?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Misstates the testimony. The
witness said -- the witness said he saw one glove.

MR. BAKER: I apologize. He saw it twice. I didn't mean -- I apologize.
I didn't mean --

Can you put up Exhibit 89.

(Steve complies.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Let me show you Exhibit , and ask you to take a look
at that.

(The instrument herein described was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 101.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Can you see that, Officer?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And is that approximately where you saw the glove when you first
visualized it?

A. It was under some foliage, like that, sir; yes, sir.

Q. Okay. And to your knowledge, was that glove moved?

A. When I arrived, sir?

Q. Yeah.

A. No, sir; it was never moved when I was there.

Q. Now, this is Exhibit 1327. That glove has now been moved, has it
not?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Lack of foundation. Mr. Baker was
showing him two different photos, taken at two different times: One
before the coroner moved the bodies, and one after.

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object, too. There has been no evidence that
the coroner moved the bodies.

MR. MEDVENE: Mr. Baker knows those two pictures were taken at
different times.

THE COURT: Excuse me, Counsel. If you have an objection, I want you to
approach the bench; I don't want speaking objections.

MR. BAKER: May we approach the bench?

THE COURT: You may.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, Mr. Baker showed this witness two
photos: One photo that was taken, and which Mr. Baker knows the
evidence will show, was taken at sometime after 9 o'clock in the
morning, and another photo that Mr. Baker knows was taken before the
bodies were moved. We believe that's the one.

And there is no foundation established as to when these photographs
were taken. And if the witness knows when they were taken -- the
witness has testified that one picture was how he saw it at the time.

And what my objection is, is that Mr. Baker, knowingly, I think, has
shown this witness a picture after this witness left the scene. The
witness testified he left the scene, was off duty at :10.

I'll represent to Your Honor that the coroner didn't get there until
after 9:10. The photo that was taken, the photo we showed was taken
before :00 a.m. We think it was taken about 6:30.

Mr. Baker's theory is, it was taken a little before. But the other
photo that Mr. Baker put up and asked him about was taken after the
bodies were moved; that's what the testimony is going to show. And
there's no other evidence that's going to be introduced that wasn't
taken after the bodies were moved.

I guess all I'm saying, Your Honor, is --

THE COURT: What's the foundation for that second photo?

MR. MEDVENE: The photo that we asked about on direct.

THE COURT: What's the foundation for the second photo?

MR. MEDVENE: When you say the second photo, you mean the one --

THE COURT: What is the foundation for the second photo?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, the one they already put up, the other photo
was taken before.

THE COURT: What is that one right there?

MR. MEDVENE: Detective --

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, you walked away. What is the foundation for that
photo right there?

MR. BAKER: That photo right there? Well, the photograph was taken
before dawn, and the coroner didn't get there until 9 o'clock.

THE COURT: When was the other photograph taken?

MR. BAKER: Before dawn, as well.

MR. MEDVENE: Detective Lange will say the first photo that Mr. Baker
showed was taken after the coroner moved the bodies; that the first
photo which we've talked about isn't the first.

THE COURT: Excuse me. I'm going sustain the objection of that
photograph. That photograph is without foundation. You can lay a
foundation with the photographer.

MR. BAKER: All right.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, after -- strike that.

Did you leave after 4:20 in the morning?

A. (No verbal response.)

Q. The crime scene?

A. No, sir.

Q. What did you do after you signed off your witness statement at 0420
hours on the 13th?

A. I walked to Dorothy and Bundy and was assigned to continue the
crime-scene log, sir.

Q. And did you then continue the crime-scene log until when?

A. I continued it approximately, maybe an hour, I believe.

Q. To about 5:20?

A. Approximately, sir.

Q. As the keeper of crime-scene log, you were to log in and out every
LAPD or law enforcement officer who comes to the scene or leaves the
scene, correct?

A. Any LAPD, yes, sir, or any other officers. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you do that, Officer Terrazas?

A. To the best of my ability, yes, sir.

Q. Did you log out officers when they left the scene?

A. To the best of my ability, yes.

Q. And did you log out Detective Vannatter when he left the scene?

A. If he left when I was there, yes, sir.

Q. All right. See where it says Detective Vannatter, his badge -- I
guess his badge number, is it?

A. I believe that to be a serial number.

Q. 14877?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay. You see what time he checked in over there, 0405, on the
left?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You see what time he checked out?

A. There is none, sir.

Q. Do you know what time he left?

A. No, sir, I don't.

Q. And you were in charge of the crime log from at least 4:20 to 5:20,
correct?

A. Yes, sir. Approximately 5:20, sir.

Q. 5:20. That's not --

A. Till approximately 5:20 sir, in the morning.

Q. That's not the time you have Vannatter check out of there?

A. No, sir.

Q. Move it up, see what time you have. We have -- you have Detective
Lange -- it's two more down.

Well, see, so you've got Detective Lange checking in 0425 in the
morning, and out at 12:15. Is that p.m.? Is that the next day, or was
that your entry at all?

A. That's not my entry, sir.

Q. Okay. Now, if Detective Vannatter left the crime scene at 5 o'clock
to go to Rockingham, you had an obligation to ensure that you logged
him out?

A. It was at approximately 0520 hours. Yes, sir, I had an obligation.

Q. It was at 5 o'clock you had an obligation, as well?

A. That's correct, sir.

Q. And to look at that log, he's still there, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay. Now, one of the things that you need a crime-scene log to be
accurate for is so that if you have to go back and reconstruct, you
can reconstruct who's been in and out of the crime scene, correct?

A. Can you repeat it once more, sir?

Q. One of the reasons you need an accurate crime-scene log is, if in
fact you have to reconstruct who was at the accident, the crime scene,
you have a log to determine who came, when they came, who exited and
when they exited, true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And can you tell me what time in that log entry, what time Rokahr
got there? Is that 0240?

A. (No verbal response.)

Q. See 3 above Vannatter? I know it's difficult to see there.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, the exhibit speaks for itself. The
witness said he didn't take over the log until 4:00. I think it shows
3:25, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I guess that was -- I can't tell what it says.

MR. BAKER: That's why I was asking.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In any event, do you know who photographer Rokahr
is?

A. I remember seeing a photographer there. I don't know who he is.

Q. Did you see, while you were on your post between 12:35 and 420,
anybody take any pictures?

MR. BAKER: You can turn it off.

A. To the best of my recollection, no, sir. I don't remember.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you log out Detectives Phillips and Fuhrman,
assuming that they left the scene at 0500 hours, when it was your duty
to do so?

A. Did I log them out, sir?

Q. Yeah.

A. If they left between that time, I was supposed to, sir.

Q. I didn't ask you if you were supposed to. I think we established
that. Did you?

A. I don't believe I logged him out because I had already gone home,
sir.

Q. You had gone home at 0500 hours?

A. No, no, sir. I left at 5 o'clock.

Q. You didn't go home until 7:15, did you?

A. Approximately.

Q. Now, did you see Rokahr or any police photographer, regardless of
their name, taking any pictures from where you were in back of the
garage on Bundy?

A. From the rear? I don't remember.

Q. You don't recall a photographer?

A. I don't recall seeing a photographer back there.

Q. You certainly didn't tell any police photographer what evidence he
or he should photograph, right?

A. No, sir.

Q. Okay. Did you at any time see a police photographer when you were
out front?

A. I don't remember seeing one, sir.

Q. So you don't recall seeing a police photographer at any time,
correct?

A. No, sir. I don't remember seeing him.

Q. And as best you recall, as you sit here now, in the three hours and
forty minutes or so that you were in the back and in charge of
security, the only people that went through the garage into the house
was Fuhrman, Phillips, and Vannatter, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Asked an answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Nothing further, Your Honor.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Did anyone from the -- any representative of Mr. Simpson, call you
and ask to speak with you?

A. No, sir.

Q. If they had, would you have spoken with them?

MR. BAKER: Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) If you assumed that Detectives Fuhrman and
Phillips arrived at Bundy at about 2:10 a.m., how much prior to that
did you see the blood that you've described on the back gate?

MR. BAKER: I object to the hypothetical in terms of time. He already
testified as to the time he believed they arrived.

THE COURT: Why don't you rephrase the question and ask him what time
he saw the blood.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) The blood that you've described finding on the
gate, approximately what time was that?

A. Approximately 12:30, 12:35, approximately.

Q. Had Detective Fuhrman and Detective Phillips arrived at Bundy prior
to the time that you observed the blood that you've described for the
jury?

A. I don't remember seeing them back there, sir. They could have
arrived at the front. I don't remember seeing them in the back with
me, no, sir. To the best of my recollection, no, they had not arrived.

Q. You were the first officer on the scene with Officer Riske?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. When you made the observation you've testified about, about seeing
just one glove, and your testimony about looking over the scene with a
flashlight, had Detectives Phillips and Fuhrman yet arrived?

A. No, sir.

MR. MEDVENE: May I approach the witness, Your Honor?

THE COURT: You may.

MR. MEDVENE: Your Honor, I'm going to place in front of the witness
what's been marked 82, and ask you'd put 82 on the board. And I'm
going ask the witness to make certain markings on 82, and request
permission to, at the clerk's pleasure, to call this Exhibit 82-A or
2098.

THE CLERK: 2098.

(The instrument herein described was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2098.)

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, may I observe?

MR. MEDVENE: I'm sorry.

MR. BAKER: I understand that. I want to watch him mark what he's going
to mark.

MR. MEDVENE: I'm going to place before Officer Terrazas, the
photograph that's on the board that we've numbered 2098.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And I'd ask you to circle, if you would --

MR. BAKER: Do you want this?

THE WITNESS: That's okay.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I ask you to circle. If you would, the blood spot
that you described as .

A. (Witness complies.)

that next to the 115 N.

A. (Witness complies.)

Q. And you made both those circles and put down your initials?

A. That's correct.

Q. Thank you.

One last question: When you wrote your report, did you mean to include
everything in your report, or was it just supposed to be a summary
that capsulized --

MR. BAKER: Objection. Leading, suggestive, argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you tell us whether your report was to record
everything in detail that you saw?

MR. BAKER: Same objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No, sir. Just a brief overview of what I did and what I observed.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, I'd move into evidence.

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2098.)

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Officer
Terrazas.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Let me show you Exhibit 2098 again, Officer.

Now, right before the 116, you indicated this was blood drops on the
mesh, did you not?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you did it on Exhibit 82, correct?

A. If this is Exhibit 82.

Q. Yeah.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You want to circle that?

A. Circle what, sir?

Q. The blood drops that you showed on the mesh.

A. Oh, yes, sir.

Q. Thank you.

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object.

MR. MEDVENE: I'm waiting.

MR. BAKER: I wasn't.

You want to put this up?

Can you focus that in?

Maybe, maybe not.

That's better.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you circled an area right above the No. 116,
did you not?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you thought that was a blood spot, and that's what you
indicated when you were asked about this blood spot on the back gate?

A. To the best of my recollection, yes, sir.

Q. Thank you. Nothing further.

MR. MEDVENE: If you would, put on the board, please, 85.

FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION

BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. What is 85, Officer Terrazas?

A. It appears to be the rear gate leading into the residence from the
alley.

MR. MEDVENE: Would you put on the board 86, please.

(Steve complies.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Would you take a look at 86. And what is that?

A. Appears to be the blood drop I observed June 13, 1994, sir.

Q. From looking --

A. It would be, looking at it, eastbound. And the gate itself would be
facing westbound.

Q. That be the area you were outside, guarding?

A. Outside, looking into the walkway.

MR. MEDVENE: May I approach, Your Honor?

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I'm going to place in front of you what we're
marking as 2099.

(The instrument herein described was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2099.)

Q. I'm going to ask if you would be good enough to circle the area of
the mesh where you observed the blood in early morning hours of June
13.

A. (Witness complies.)

MR. MEDVENE: Would you please place on the board what's been marked as
2099.

(Steve complies.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you just point out for the jury where you've
circled.

A. (Witness complies.)

Q. What is that?

A. Its a blood drop I observed June 13, , on the rear gate of 875
South Bundy.

Q. Facing?

A. Facing westbound, sir.

Q. You say facing westbound --

MR. BAKER: I'll object, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) As you stand outside the gate, which direction is
it facing?

MR. BAKER: Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. As I stand outside the gate, the gate would face westbound; the
blood would face westbound. In order to look at it, I'd have to look
at it eastbound.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) So, in other words, if the victims are found in
the position, roughly, of where the court reporter is, and you're
walking back westbound, and if the gate is approximately where the
podium is --

A. You lost me, sir.

Q. If the victims are found roughly where the court reporter is --

A. Correct.

Q. -- and you walk westbound to the gate,

and the gate is approximately where the podium is --

A. Correct.

Q. -- you were standing guard between approximately 12:30 and 4
o'clock, where?

A. To the rear, sir. It would be outside the gate area, sir.

Q. And Exhibit 2099 that you just drawn a circle around would be
where, as you observed it from where you were standing?

A. It would be outside, sir, towards the alleyway.

Q. On the outside of the alley?

A. On the outside portion, yes, sir.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you very much. I have nothing further. We move in
2099, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2099.)

FURTHER RECROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Now, did you find the blood drops that you, circled at 115 and 116
initially, when you got back there, and you opened the gate and you
went into the walkway to the north of the house?

A. I didn't open the gate, sir.

Q. Well, who opened the gate?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope of redirect.

THE COURT: You may reopen.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Who opened the gate?

A. My partner, Officer Riske.

Q. Then you went inside the gate, into the walkway with him, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And was it at that time that you saw the blood drops?

A. Yes, sir. Yes, as I walked in there, sir.

Q. As you walked in, you saw the blood drops, correct?

A. As I walked in, in the inside portion, yes, sir. I examined the
gate and I examined where I was walking, yes, sir.

Q. All right. So that I'm clear, we'll use Mr. Medvene's example. And
you're walking west. The gate, if you're walking west, opens towards
you, does it not?

A. To the best of my recollection, it would open in a westerly motion,
sir.

Q. When you went through gate, did you push it open, or did it come
towards you?

A. I never pushed it open, sir.

Q. Regardless of who moved it, did it go towards you, or what?

A. It would come towards me, going westbound, sir.

Q. Did you -- as you got inside the gate, did you then turn around and
take a couple of feet and look at the gate?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Is that when you examined and found all three blood spots?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay. And so when you examined and found all three blood spots,
you're looking from east to west, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Vague and ambiguous. What all three blood
spots?

MR. BAKER: 115, 116, 117.

MR. MEDVENE: He also mentioned one on top, Your Honor.

THE COURT: This is Mr. Baker's question. Overruled.

MR. BAKER: I need help, but not yours.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you understand the question?

A. Can you repeat it? It's the one with the three circles, 115, 116.
117 is 2.

Q. Okay. Now, 115, 116, and the bloody spot on the mesh --

A. Correct.

Q. -- those you observed, sir, by being inside, if you will, between
the west gate and the east gate, correct?

A. To the best of my recollection, yes, sir.

Q. All right. And after you had observed all three of those blood
spots, sir, you didn't relate those to anybody, correct --

A. I --

Q. -- at the time, I mean.

A. Officer Riske knew about them, sir.

Q. He knew about them or didn't know about them?

A. I told him about them.

Q. You told him about all three of the blood spots: The one you
circled 115, 116, and then the one which doesn't have a label on it,
which would be 117, up here?

A. To the best of my recollection, yes, sir.

Q. All right.

MR. BAKER: Do I don't have anything further.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, I believe that's 208.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. MEDVENE: One second, Your Honor.

(Referring to photos that were marked by

counsel.)

MR. MEDVENE: If you'll indulge me one moment, Your Honor. I apologize.

(Pause in proceedings.)

FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Just so I'm clear, Officer Terrazas, did you, if you looked at the
gate from the outside where you were standing guard, looking towards
the front of the house -- okay?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Looking at the gate that way, can you tell us whether or not you
observed any blood on the gate?

A. Looking from the outside, looking eastbound towards the house, I
observed one drop of blood on the gate.

Q. Is that the blood you described and circled a few minutes ago?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. After you walked in within the gate and you looked outward -- in
other words, looking westbound, did you observe any blood?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Is that the blood that's up on the board now, where you circled 115
and 116?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Leading and suggestive of those two being
circled. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

You may answer.

A. Yes, it is the blood I circled, sir.

MR. MEDVENE: Nothing further.

FURTHER RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Officer Terrazas, the one you circled above 116, is that the one
you observed outside and just dripped inside the mesh? Is that what
you believe?

A. No, sir; that's not what I believe at all, sir.

Q. All right. So the one you've circled here, too, that's a blood
drop?

A. From the best of my recollection yes, sir.

Q. That's a blood drop you viewed east, looking west, right?

A. To its best of my recollection, yes, sir.

Q. You say there's another one you viewed west, looking east?

A. Yes, sir. That would be the first one I observed, the one that was
on the outside portion of the gate, sir.

Q. So you looked at four separate blood drops plus the top of the
rail?

A. There would be one on the outside, sir -- one on the outside, one
up on top, one in the middle, this one and this one, sir.

Q. And the middle one is the one that's right above 116?

A. From what I can remember sir, yes, sir.

Q. Now, were you ever shown those photos in the meeting you had with
Mr. Medvene?

A. Yes, I was, sir.

Q. Did he take you through these photos and show you the blood drops
to refresh your recollection?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. That's what you did for an hour with Mr. Medvene, go over the
blood-drop photos on the back gate or --

A. Mostly just the blood-drop photos.

Q. Most of the hour, you went through the photos the blood-drop photos
so you'd have it clear when you came into court and testified, right?

A. Approximately, yes, sir.

MR. BAKER: Thank you. Nothing further.

MR. MEDVENE: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Thank you. You're excused.

Ten-minutes' recess, ladies and gentlemen.

Don't talk about the case; don't form or express any opinions.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'd like to move into evidence label 1327,
which is exhibit 40. It was 132 from the criminal trial. It's exhibit
40 here and .

THE COURT: Wait a minute.

THE CLERK: We had referred to this exhibit as . That's the wrong
designation. It should be exhibit 40. It's already been received in
evidence for verification. I believe you wanted to move into evidence,
Plaintiffs' exhibit 101.

MR. PETROCELLI: Is 101 our number?

THE CLERK: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: So what's being moved in, 101?

MR. BAKER: 101, really? 40's already in?

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 101.)

THE COURT: I got a request from the jurors that the lawyers introduce
themselves for their notes. Shows you what an impression you all have
been making. (Laughter.)

The problem, ladies and gentlemen, is that, you know, there seems to
be kind of a moveable feast in the sense that everybody's sitting in
different places at different times. Do you want them to introduce
themselves again right now. Is take that what you want?

JUROR: Not everybody. Just, for example, that gentleman who was
speaking today. I don't know who know his who or who he's representing
with the beard. Just, I don't know several of them.

THE COURT: That's Mr. Medvene. There's two beards.

MR. PETROCELLI: This is Mr. Medvene, Mr. Gelblum. And we have Mr.
Lambert who's not here today. And the four of us represent plaintiff
Fredrick Goldman.

MR. KELLY: Anybody else? John Kelly, representing the estate of Nicole
Brown Simpson with Callan sitting next to me.

MR. BREWER: Mike Brewer representing Sharon Rufo. And at times, I'll
have William Driscoll with me.

MR. BAKER: Bob Baker. This is Dan Leonard, Bob Blaiser. That's my son
Phil Baker and we all represent Mr. Simpson.

THE COURT: And Mr. Baker, you have a couple other attorneys that come
from time to time.

MR. BAKER: Melissa Bluestein comes every now and again.

THE COURT: Is there another?

MR. BAKER: I think that's about it; isn't it? Yeah.

THE COURT: Okay. I thought there was somebody else but that's okay.

MR. BAKER: Possibly thinking of Richard Gabriel the consultant.

THE COURT: Oh, the consultant.

MR. MEDVENE: Can we be heard later on 101 in terms of foundation?

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you.

Sergeant David Rossi.

DAVID ROSSI, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiff Goldman, was
duly sworn and testified as follows,

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

discovered that there was a double homicide the two victims dead in
front of 875 south Bundy.

around the location. I made a point to make sure that officers were
strategically placed for security as far as stopping any unauthorized
vehicular or pedestrian traffic.

MR. BAKER: Move to strike in view of the court's prior ruling.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: That the banner tape and officer place taping out of the
record.

THE COURT: It's already in.

MR. BAKER: I request it be stricken from the record.

THE COURT: It will not be stricken. Objection came too late.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you then make any request of Sergeant Coon and
Officer Riske?

A. Yes, I did. They spoke with me in front of the location in the
street and --

MR. BAKER: Object to anything more than yes.

THE COURT: Sustained.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

A. Yes. I asked Sergeant Coon and Officer Riske to escort me through
the crime scene.

Q. And why did you want to be escorted through the crime scene?

Q. And when did you see that person?

A. That's the body of the female that I observed at the front of the
location.

Q. And I direct you to exhibit 38. Appears to be a body of a male. Did
you ever see that before?

A. Yes, sir, I did.

THE COURT: Counsel, why don't you put that on a higher rung so that
everybody can see that?

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Those other two fold out halfway down. They'll fold out.

MR. MEDVENE: Everybody see?

JURORS: Um-hum.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Use the pointer if you're going to have him do anything
with that.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, would you be good enough Sergeant to -- those
two exhibits are magnetic and you can move them around. Could you
place the position of the nail in the approximate position that you
saw this scene at on June 13, in the early morning hours.

And the male lying in the position as it appears here?

Q. Let me put up on the TV, if I might, exhibit 38.

I ask if that's clear for the jurors. If the light's off, it's clear.

Q. If you'd put up 89, please. 89 has been placed in front of you.
What is 89, if you can tell us?

A. That appears to be a knit watch cap.

Q. And next to it?

A. And a glove.

Q. And could you please point on 2058 where you saw those items?

A. Very close to the area of this plant right here.

Q. Can you tell us whether or not you illuminated the area thoroughly?

A. Yes, I did. With my flashlight.

Q. And did you observe more than one glove?

A. No, sir, I did not.

Q. And where did you make your observation of the area? From what
vantage point?

A. I was standing in the grassy area, possibly about six feet south of
the female body.

Q. All right. Thank you. You may resume the witness stand.

After observing what you've told us about, where did you go?

A. I then walked with the Sergeant and the officer back down to the
sidewalk. We proceeded southbound on the Bundy sidewalk to the next
street which is Dorothy. Walked westbound on Dorothy to the alley and
behind the location and walked to the rear of 875 south Bundy.

Q. Can you tell us whether or not, on your way from the front to the
rear, you illuminated your pathway?

A. Yes, sir, I did all the way.

Q. With what?

A. With the same high power flashlight I was using.

you observe another glove?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did there come a time that you got to the rear gate?

A. Yes.

Q. Put up -- and did you walk through the gate?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Can you put up 82, please?

Can you tell us what is 82, if you recall? Exhibit 82 is on the board?

A. That appears to be the gate -- that gate that I saw in the rear.

Q. Did anyone point anything else out to you on the gate?

A. Officer Riske, shined his flashlight on the rear, on the bottom
running of the gate and pointed out blood drops.

Q. Could you take a look at exhibit 82 and ask what, or can you tell
us what that is?

A. That appears to be the blood that I observed that night on the
bottom rail of the gate.

Q. Can you -- could you -- were those markers, 115 and 116, on the
gate that evening when you observed it?

A. No, sir.

Q. Could you point out the drops that you remember seeing?

A. Here and here.

MR. BAKER: Let the record reflect that he pointed to the dark spots
directly under the running where 116 is, correct, Officer Rossi?

THE WITNESS: Yes.

MR. BAKER: Right. Directly lower.

THE COURT: Actually that's the not a rung that's a vertical bar.

MR. BAKER: Vertical bar. I guess a rung goes the other way.

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. BAKER: I apologize.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Officer Rossi, your memory is that you saw certain
blood on the rear gate?

A. Yes.

Q. And then what did you do?

A. Then I walked out of the walkway and to the back, to the rear of
the house.

Q. And sometime later, strike that, were

Detectives Phillips and Fuhrman at the Bundy scene at the time you had
your walk through of the crime scene and went around to the rear?

A. No, they weren't.

Q. And approximately how much later did they arrive, if you know?

A. Approximately half an hour later.

Q. Did there come a time later that morning when you went back to west
L.A. office?

A. Yes, sir.

MR. MEDVENE: I have nothing further, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Cross.

MR. MEDVENE: Court please, we'd move in 2058.

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2058).

CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Now, how long did you meet with Mr. Medvene, Officer Rossi?

A. Approximately two hours.

Q. And did you go through this little exercise that you'd done here
today?

A. Yes.

Q. And you kind of worked it out so that you could get this one on
this?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Correct. All right. And then I went through the -- when was that,
by the way, Officer Rossi?

A. Last night.

Q. And then you went through the photos so you could get the blood
spots right on the gate?

A. He showed me the photos, yes.

Q. Did you want to put that one back up?

While they're getting that -- Okay. Have we got a lazer of that?

Now this photograph, did he tell you this photograph was taken on July
3, 1994, some two and a half, three weeks after the incident?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did he show you any photograph at all of the back gate that was
taken on June 13, 1994, the date that you were there?

A. I don't know when the photographs were taken.

Q. Did he represent to you that that photograph right there was taken
on, or implied that that photograph -- and I'm talking about Mr.
Medvene, did he imply that photograph was taken the night of the
murders?

A. No.

Q. Did you understand that to be the case?

A. No.

Q. Now, you believe that the blood spot is here and here, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And -- well, never mind.

Now, I want to go back and have you just draw on a laser photograph
where you believe those where. You've just told us that they were. You
just circle the area that you just indicated to the jury that were
blood spots on the back gate and put your initials.

A. Put my initials?

Q. Yes, if you'd be kind enough, sure I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

Did you see any other blood drops on the back gate that night?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. All right. Now, nothing on the mesh?

A. I didn't notice anything.

Q. Okay. I want to, if we may, sir, I want to go back to when you were
watch commander. What can we label this next one? This one where he's
initialed?

THE CLERK: 2100.

MR. BAKER: 2100. Thank you.

(The instrument herein described was marked for identification as
Defendant's Exhibit No. 2100.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, were you in uniform the night of June 13, 1994?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. And when you were at you're -- at west Los Angeles police
department that night, correct, sir?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And that's on the corner of Santa Monica and Purdue, right?

A. Santa Monica and Butler.

Q. I'm sorry. And that is west and south of the crime location,
correct?

A. I think east and south, I would think.

Q. East it is? Thank you. You're absolutely right. Now, when you got
notification of the double homicide by Officer Riske, you talked to
him on the telephone, did you not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you understand that he was in the house in the condominium
on the phone of the residence of that condominium?

A. I don't remember where he called from. I don't know where he called
from.

Q. Did you believe that he was on his police radio?

A. Well, I know he wasn't on his police radio. It was a phone.

Q. 'Cause you were on a telephone?

A. Yes.

Q. And he told you, did he not, that OJ Simpson was somehow involved
in these double homicides?

A. No, sir. He did not.

Q. Officer Riske never mentioned to you that O.J. Simpson was
involved?

A. No, sir.

Q. You never heard that from him?

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. And so if he testified to that, he'd be incorrect, true?

A. Far as I remember.

Q. And then you say you made some notifications, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, you were aware that it was believed that one of the victims
was Nicole Brown Simpson before you notified anybody, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And you got that from your conversation with Officer Riske?

A. That's correct.

Q. And if, in fact, you had known that it was Nicole Brown Simpson
that was the victim, you would --you would of course, notify robbery
homicide right away, true?

A. No, sir.

Q. What you did was you notified Lieutenant Spangler, correct?

A. Not first, but I did.

Q. Who did you notify first?

A. Detective Ron Phillips.

Q. You recall testifying in the criminal trial?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Go to page 14448. At page 14448, line 12 let me start at line 11. I
apologize, sir. (Reading:)

"Q. Who did you notify?

"A. I made six telephonic notifications to detectives in my command
staff. The first telephone call I made was to Detective Spangler who's
the commanding officer of West Los Angeles police detective."

Detective, does that refresh your recollection?

A. Yes, sir and I got an answering machine.

Q. So the first call you made wasn't to Ron Phillips it was to
Lieutenant Spangler, right?

A. The first notification I made was to Ron Phillips.

Q. Okay. That wasn't a notification?

A. Not in person. It was a tape machine.

Q. Well, none of yours -- strike that. Then you notified, after you
got the tape machine, then you called Ron Phillips?

A. I believe that's correct, yes.

Q. The first person that you tried to get a hold of was Lieutenant
Spangler, yes or no?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, then after you got a hold of Ron Phillips, you told him about
the situation, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you indicated to Detective Ron Phillips that you had what you
believe was a very high profile case, correct?

A. I believe I did, yes.

Q. And you told him that because you believed that Nicole Brown
Simpson was one of the victims, true?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you knew that then? That is when you talked to Ron Phillips.
Correct?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Now, then you phoned Captain Kurth, did you not?

A. I believe that's correct, yes.

Q. How long were you -- who's Captain Kurth?

A. At the time he was the area commanding officer, the captain of the
west L.A. area.

Q. All right. And he was one of the higher-ups that you had to notify
because this was, in fact, a high profile case, correct?

A. He would be notified on any homicide, sir.

Q. And you indicated to him, did you not, that one of the victims was
Nicole Brown Simpson, true?

A. I believe I did, yes.

Q. All right. And then you next phoned assistant commanding officer of
operations, west Bureau commander Bushey, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And after you talked to -- how long were you on the phone to him? A
minute? Minute and a half. Somewhere in there?

A. Possibly, so, yes.

Q. And so Kurth and Bushey approximately three, four minutes, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you found Ron Phillips which when you talked to, he was in bed,
true?

A. I don't remember. More than likely.

Q. I mean, you're talking -- we're talking after. o'clock in the
morning, aren't we?

A. It was around 1 o'clock, yes.

Q. And the phone calls and notifications you made to Spangler,
Phillips, Kurth, Bushey, Frankel and Lieutenants, I believe Coon.
Ideal those were all made one call after the other?

A. That is correct.

Q. All right. And when you made those toes calls, you then, after you
talked to commander Bushey, you talked to chief deputy Frankel, did
you not?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, deputy chief Frankel at this time indicated to you that he
wanted robbery homicide Division to be involved, true.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Hearsay. Outside the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On what grounds?

THE COURT: Hearsay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) From that telephone conversation, you were aware
yourself that robbery homicide division was to be called, true?

A. No, sir.

Q. You talked to commander -- I'm sorry you talked to deputy chief
Frankel about 1:15, did you not?

A. Yes, possibly, sir.

Q. And Detective Frankel gave you an order at 1:15 in the morning to
transfer the case downtown to robbery homicide division, true or
untrue?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Hearsay. Relevance.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) At 1:15 in the morning, you were aware that the case
was to be transferred to robbery homicide, division, yes or no?

A. No.

Q. You did not relay any transfer of the case from 1:15 in the morning
until 2:10 in the morning to robbery homicide division; isn't that
true, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Hearsay. Relevance.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

THE COURT: Overruled. You can answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: Would you please repeat the question?

MR. BAKER: You were in receipt of an order to transfer the case?

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection. That wasn't the question you
asked. But if that's the question you're going to ask, it would be
hearsay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) were aware you were required to transfer the case,
that is the double homicide at 875 south Bundy from West L.A. to
robbery homicide division at 1:15 in the morning, true?

A. No, sir. But if you would like me to tell you what Frankel told me,
it might clear this up.

Q. I've been getting objections.

THE COURT: Don't look at me. I'm not the one objecting.

MR. BAKER: I'm looking at you. You're the one sustaining them.

THE COURT: Can't help it. (Laughter.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, let's talk a little bit about robbery homicide
division, that's division downtown at Parker center, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And if robbery homicide division takes over a case, whether it be
in West L.A. or Van Nuys or wherever, then, the detectives from that
area and any other police officers are to stay clear of the crime
scene, true?

A. No, sir.

Q. They're not to go into the area of the crime scene. They're not to
destroy or to in any way, touch or interfere with any evidence,
correct.

MR. MEDVENE: Improper hypothetical. It's been asked and answered
previous -- it's a previous question and answer.

THE COURT: The answer was no. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, is it your testimony, then, that if in fact
robbery homicide division was taken over, it would be perfectly all
right for Detective Fuhrman and Phillips to go into the condominium,
to go into the crime scene where the victims' bodies were?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative. Assumes facts not in evidence.
Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: You may lay a foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's okay. Now, I want to go back to robbery
homicide for a moment and is it -- strike that.

When robbery homicide takes over a case, they then have authority over
the crime scene?

A. Yes, sir, that's correct.

Q. And in this case, you received -- Strike that.

Let me just read what you testified to at the criminal trial.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. It's argument.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On what grounds?

THE COURT: Well, you can ask him a question but you can't just read
from his transcript without some basis.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You were aware of an order at 1:15 in the morning
that you didn't effectuate until 2:10 in the morning by transferring
the jurisdiction over the Nicole Brown Simpson murder to robbery
homicide division, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE WITNESS: That wasn't the order that I received.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: You may answer yes or no.

MR. BAKER: You want to answer the question?

THE WITNESS: Would you ask it again, please, because --

MR. BAKER: May the reporter read it, Your Honor?

(The question was read as follows:)

"Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You were aware of an order at 1:15 in the morning
that you didn't effectuate until 2:10 in the morning by transferring
the jurisdiction over the Nicole Brown Simpson murder to robbery
homicide division, correct?"

THE COURT: I'm going to sustain the objection as compound. You may ask
that in two pieces.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you tell Detective Ron Phillips that the case
was going to be transferred to robbery homicide division at any time
before walkway 2:10 in the morning of the 13th?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And as I understand it, Detective Rossi, at that time, what time
did you tell Detective Ron Phillips that RHD was going to take over
the case?

A. After he had responded to the scene. So it was probably around
2:30.

Q. Okay. Now, you said after robbery homicide responded to the scene
or after he had responded?

A. After he had responded to the scene.

Q. Okay. Now, at 1:15 in the morning is when you had the conversation
with Deputy Chief Frankel, right?

A. At approximately 1:15, yes.

Q. And you then left west Los Angeles police station at 1:20?

A. Possibly around 1:15, 1:20, yes.

Q. So after you talked to Lieutenant Constance Dial, you left the
police station?

A. Captain Dial.

Q. I'm sorry, Captain, I apologize.

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. And you drove directly to 875 south Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. And when you got to 875 south Bundy, you took the tour of the crime
scene that you told us about, true?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then you went out front. You went back from the back of the --
Strike that. Did you ever see -- did you ever see officer Terrazas?

A. Yes, sir, at the rear location.

Q. Did you talk to him?

A. I don't remember if I did or not.

Q. But you saw him there?

A. Yes.

Q. And did he see you?

A. I'm sure he did.

Q. And there was Officer Coon, Sergeant Coon and Officer Riske,
correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. The three of you and Terrazas were all there in the back and opened
the gate, right?

A. No. The gate was open by Officer Riske and he and I walked down the
pathway a few feet.

Q. Which way did he open the gate?

A. As I recall, he opened it out.

Q. Towards himself?

A. That's what I remember, yeah.

Q. When I -- when you walk up there to the gate, was the gate in a
closed position that required him to open it and pull it towards him?

A. I don't remember.

Q. You have no recollection?

A. I don't remember what position the gate was in.

Q. You don't know if it was open, closed? You do remember that he
pulled it towards him?

A. That's possible. I'm not sure.

Q. Do you have a recollection? I don't want to put words in your
mouth. You said that if you have a recollection, state it. If not,
state that.

A. I don't have a recollection.

Q. All right. Then you walked down the walkway on the north side of
the condominium, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Came back the same way you entered, true?

A. True.

Q. To the alley portion of the property, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And then did you stay there and talk to anybody?

A. Not that remember.

Q. Exited from there and went directly back down to Dorothy and around
to Bundy in front of 875?

A. Yes. Yes, sir.

Q. And how long were you there before you talked to anybody else?

A. I waited for detectives.

Q. You waited for detectives. That would be Phillips and Fuhrman?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, Phillips and Fuhrman arrived approximately when?

A. I don't remember exactly. Possibly somewhere between 2 o'clock and
2:30.

Q. And then you did the same thing with them. Took them up to the area
where the victim's bodies were and then walked around to the back
portion?

A. Yes, sir. Same thing.

Q. Now, to your knowledge, had anybody come out of the housing through
the house and come out the back way?

A. I'm not sure what you mean, sir.

Q. Fair enough. To your knowledge, had anybody come out the back of
the condominium into the alleyway from inside the property?

A. No.

Q. Garage door was down?

A. Open.

Q. Was it your understanding the garage door was open when the crime
scene was discovered?

A. I didn't know.

Q. Now, after you did that with detective Fuhrman, you hadn't received
-- and Phillips -- strike that.

You hadn't received, all the time you were at the crime scene, you
hadn't received any communications from anybody, did you? From the
outside? From robbery, homicide, from deputy chief Frankel, from
commander Bushey; you hadn't received any communications, had you?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. When did you receive communication?

A. After I went from the rear to the front and while I was waiting for
the detectives.

Q. When you were waiting for the detectives, you received a call from
whom?

A. Captain Dial arrived and she had a cellular phone and we received a
call from Commander Bushey.

Q. Now, did you receive any communications from deputy chief Frankel
while you were on the location?

A. No, sir.

Q. All right. Now, you made this tour with Detectives Fuhrman and
Phillips after they arrived did you not?

A. That's correct.

Q. And after they had arrived, you had taken them and seen the
victim's bodies then he walked around the back and gone all through
the house, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Beyond the scope the whole area.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Would you say -- I don't understand what your saying, all
through the house. Are you saying both of the men are at the house?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Both of them enter the house.

Q. I'm saying both of them entered the house and they were gone from
your view for 10 minutes, 15 minutes?

A. Ron Phillips didn't even enter the house but Mark Fuhrman did.

Q. Anybody go with Mark Fuhrman?

A. I don't remember, possibly Lieutenant Spangler. I don't remember.

Q. As you sit here now, you have no recollection of anybody going in
the property; that is in the back door, through the garage, in the
back door in the living portion of the house with mark Fuhrman? He
weren't by himself as far as you recall?

A. Seems like he went with somebody else but I don't remember who.

Q. You don't have a recollection of who this somebody else is, right?

A. Not exactly, no.

Q. And when Mark Fuhrman was in the house for ten or -- ten or 15
minutes, he came out. Is that when you told him that both Phillips and
Fuhrman were off the case and RHD was taking over?

A. I never told anyone that, sir.

Q. Let me read from your testimony, 14479, starting at line 19.

MR. PETROCELLI: Ron, one second. Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) (Reading:)

"Q. Now, after Detective Phillips and Fuhrman and Officer Riske all
came out of the condominium through the garage, what happened next?

"A. At that point, that is when I had a conversation with Detective
Phillips. I told him I had spoken to chief -- to Deputy Chief Frankel.
Chief Frankel informed me that if it was -- it was determined that the
victim was, in fact, Nicole Brown. Simpson, he wanted Detective
Phillips to notify Robbery-Homicide."

Correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you knew that the victim was Nicole Brown Simpson from 12:30 in
the morning, correct?

A. No, I did not.

Q. And you didn't testify to that here this afternoon that you knew
from 12:30 in the morning after you had been notified that it was
Nicole Brown Simpson who us what the victim, you didn't testify to
that this afternoon; is that right, sir?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. There. Okay. Now, then, at that point, Phillips and Fuhrman were
off the case, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Vague, ambiguous, "off the case."

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) After the phone call by Phillips to RHD they had no
more authority over the case, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes a fact not in evidence; lack of
foundation; vague and ambiguous.

THE COURT: Lay a foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Was it your understanding that after the phone call
was made, that they had -- that is, Fuhrman and Phillips, had no more
authority over the crime scene?

A. That is not my understanding.

Q. They still had authority over the crime scene, as far as you were
concerned?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. Now, you had knowledge of the chief's order to have them
call robbery/homicide long before you told them to call
robbery/homicide, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And the chief gave you an order at 1:15 in the morning, and you
forgot the chief's order until after Mark Fuhrman and Ron Phillips had
toured the entire crime scene and come out of the interior of the
condominium, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Page 14567, line 19 --

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you give us that again?

MR. BAKER: Sure. 14567, lines 19 through 22.

MR. PETROCELLI: One second.

MR. BAKER: (Reading from transcript.)

"Q. Did she give" --

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, Mr. Baker.

I don't think it's proper to read this testimony, Your Honor. The
witness has answered the question and you have sustained our
objection.

THE COURT: I don't think there's a question pending.

MR. MEDVENE: I think Mr. Baker is going to purport to read testimony
that the witness has given.

MR. BAKER: All right. Let's start back and see if we can get it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The order to have Phillips call robbery/homicide
division was an order that you were given at 1:15 in the morning,
correct?

A. What Chief Frankel told me, sir.

Q. Can you answer my question yes or no?

A. That is not correct, no.

Q. And the chief didn't give you an order to have Phillips call
robbery/homicide, right?

A. Gave me some instructions.

Q. And those instructions indicated to you that this case was to be
transferred to RHD; true or untrue?

A. True, if it was confirmed that the victim was Nicole Simpson.

Q. And that had been confirmed to your satisfaction before you ever
left West L.A. Police Station at 1:15 in the morning, correct?

A. No, sir, that's not correct.

Q. All right. So when was it purportedly confirmed to you, Sergeant
Rossi, that it was Nicole Brown Simpson?

A. It was never confirmed to me, sir.

Q. It was never confirmed. Okay.

So regardless of whether it was confirmed to you or not, you then had
Detective Phillips phone RHD at approximately 2:10 to 2:30 in the
morning, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And that was not until after they had gone through the area where
the victims' bodies were located, they had then gone around and gone
into and out of the living quarters of Nicole Brown Simpson, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And that's when you decided to relay the information
that Chief Deputy Frankel had given you at 1:15 in the morning, after
they'd toured the entire crime scene, true?

A. After about ten minutes they got there, right.

Q. And in that ten minutes -- strike that.

Could you have left a message for them at West L.A. that you were
going to see whether or not it was Nicole Brown Simpson's body, and if
so, RHD was going to take over the case?

You could have done that before you left couldn't you?

A. No.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In fact, you could have called back to West L.A.
because you were at the crime scene at 1:25, which was 45 minutes
before either Fuhrman or Phillips arrived, and tell them that RHD
would take over the case. You could have done that, too, couldn't you?

A. No, sir.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative on what the witness could or
couldn't have said.

THE COURT: Sustained. Answer stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you stayed at the crime scene until 4:10 to
4:15?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And until you told Phillips to call RHD, Phillips and Fuhrman were
in charge of the crime scene?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And after you told them to call RHD, they were no longer in charge
of the crime scene, correct?

A. No, sir.

Q. That's when -- well, did Fuhrman continue to "detect," if that's a
word, between two -- after you told him, and the time of 4 o'clock in
the morning, to your knowledge.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Foundation, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Well, I'm going to sustain this line of questioning. We
already went through this, and I sustained the objection about 12
minutes ago.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, at 5 o'clock -- strike that.

At 4:15, you went -- 4:10 to 4:15, you went back to West L.A.?

A. Yes.

Q. And you got a hamburger or something on the way back?

A. Yes.

Q. You were there about 5 o'clock?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And that's when you got a call from Phillips?

A. Yes.

Q. And Phillips wanted the phone number of Mr. Simpson's --

A. Yes.

Q. -- residence?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You had -- before you ever left West L.A., you had seen both of the
Simpson children in the West L.A. police station?

A. Are you saying before I left the station?

Q. Yes.

A. No.

Q. You had never seen either of the Simpson children before you left?

A. As I recall, I didn't see them until I got back. I may be mistaken.

Q. Page 14450, line 17.

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. Objection. Relevance, materiality, when he saw
the children. And its also beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I want to be heard on that.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. BAKER: Obviously, credibility is always an issue. But he will
testify that he spent 50 minutes going to Westec, trying to get O.J.
Simpson's phone number, when the kids were right down in the same
police station at 5 o'clock.

Further, he was already told by Riske that O.J. Simpson was Sydney's
father. And that's testimony from Riske this morning.

MR. PETROCELLI: It was stricken.

MR. MEDVENE: It's way beyond the scope on direct examination, and I
don't think it has any relevance.

THE COURT: Well, what is the relevance?

MR. BAKER: The relevance is, as I say, credibility is always an issue.
That he was supposed to have transferred this case at 1:15 in the
morning, and if he transferred it, Phillips and Fuhrman could never
have gotten to the scene.

THE COURT: Well, what is the relevance of this witness? I don't know
why he was called in the first place.

MR. MEDVENE: The relevance of the witness, Your Honor, we're just
saying before Fuhrman got there, seeing just the one glove and seeing
certain blood on the back gate, before Fuhrman got there -- but
mainly, the one glove.

THE COURT: Sustained. The objection on relevance, I don't see what the
relevance of this cross-examination has to that aspect of the case.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the Jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Is it your testimony, Sergeant Rossi that Officer
Riske never told you that he had asked Sydney Simpson if O.J. Simpson
was her father?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you ever see Mark Fuhrman pick up a glove at the
crime scene?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you ever see anybody move the glove at the crime scene?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you ever see anybody move the envelope at the crime scene?

A. No.

Q. After the notification to RHD, did you ever see Fuhrman or Phillips
go back into the residence?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Did Fuhrman, when you saw him go into the residence, stay in the
residence or not?

A. Did he stay in the residence?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Vague; ambiguous in terms of time.

MR. BAKER: I'll be happy to rephrase it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You made your own tour of the crime scene with
Sergeant Coon and Officer Riske, you testified, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Then you waited until Mark Fuhrman and Ron Phillips to get the
crime scene, and then you made a similar tour with them, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you watched Mark Fuhrman go into the house?

A. Through the garage, yes, sir.

Q. Did you ever see him come out?

A. I believe I did.

Q. How long was he in there?

A. I don't remember. Short period of time.

Q. Ten to fifteen minutes?

A. I don't think it was that long.

Q. But you saw him come out?

A. I believe I did.

Q. Did you see Lieutenant Spangler go into the house while you were
there?

A. No.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, and the outside the
scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On which ground?

THE COURT: Both.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, did you ever see Spangler come out of the
house?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I want to be heard again? I'm sorry.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. BAKER: One of the assertions is that Fuhrman was within the
custody of police officers that whole time, didn't have the
opportunity to plant the glove. And I think we've got to be given
latitude to examine these people about where Fuhrman was and where he
wasn't.

THE COURT: There is no testimony or evidence that any glove was
planted inside the condominium. There is no testimony or anything to
indicate he was in the condominium. Nothing was in the condominium.

MR. BAKER: Judge, your ruling precludes me from showing that they went
into the condominium.

THE COURT: Was there any evidence that there was blood in there?

MR. BAKER: I don't have any evidence that there was blood or wasn't
blood. All I know is, they went into that condominium and they set it
up as a command center. And we have testimony that Fuhrman was in
there and doing his notes. And we have that Fuhrman didn't come out,
and we have that Spangler went in there.

Now, I think the fact that the glove could have been in there -- I
don't know where the glove was when it was purportedly found at my
client's house and there was the drop of blood around it -- there was
a drop of blood. And the area, there wasn't a drop of blood any place,
that no -- that glove could have been in that house and picked up and
taken from there. And I should be given some latitude to find out
where he was and where he wasn't.

THE COURT: I'm going to sustain the objection.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, when you saw Detective Fuhrman, when you met
him at the corner of Dorothy and Bundy, did he have a coat on?

A. I don't believe he did, sir.

Q. When you were in the back, is it your testimony that the whole time
you were with Detective Fuhrman, he did not have a coat on at all?

A. I don't remember if he put one on.

Q. Do you have any recollection of him going to get a duty coat and
put one on?

A. No, sir, I don't.

Q. And your recollection is, when he got out of the car, he didn't
have a coat on, right?

A. As far as I remember, yes.

Q. Now, did you see Detective Roberts at any time when you were at the
back of the house?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you see Detective Roberts at any time at the crime scene?

A. Front of the house, yes, sir.

Q. When did you first see Detective Roberts?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Beyond the scope of direct, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may answer. Go ahead.

A. I saw Detective Roberts after I had come -- or returned to the
front of the house.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) From your initial trip?

A. No, sir, from the the second trip, the trip with the two
detectives.

Q. About 2:30, 2:40?

A. That would possibly be very close.

Q. You ever see them again?

A. Well, he was there.

Q. Did you ever see him at the scene again? Was he there the whole
time, till you left at 4:15?

A. Yes, he was.

Q. And you saw him just before you left the scene at 4:15, correct?
That is, Detective Roberts?

A. I don't remember if I saw him then, sir.

Q. You have a recollection of the last time you saw him?

A. No, I don't.

Q. How many officers were at the scene when you left between 4:10 and
4:15, approximately?

A. Several. I don't remember how many, sir.

Q. In excess of 20?

A. Not that many.

Q. Fifteen, twenty?

A. Excuse me. You mean uniformed officers?

Q. No.

A. Anybody?

Q. Anybody employed by LAPD.

A. I would say less than 20.

Q. And were the two most senior people at the time you left, Vanatter
and Lange?

A. I did not see Vannatter, but Lange was there.

Q. So Lange got there before Vannatter?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you have known Lange from before?

A. No, sir.

Q. You met him that night?

A. Didn't meet him, saw him.

Q. And somebody told you that was Lange?

A. I knew it was.

Q. All right. And then the next, before RHD became involved in the
crime, that would be senior and in charge of the crime scene, would
have been Fuhrman and Phillips, right?

A. Detective Spangler. Actually, he's a lieutenant.

Q. In charge of the actual detective work at the crime scene, you'd
have Vannatter, Lange, and then Fuhrman and Phillips?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: I don't have anything further at this time.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, there's one exhibit we want to get
from the jury room. It's a board.

(Counsel displays large poster board.)

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. I put on the board, Detective Rossi, what's been marked as
Plaintiffs' 80. And I ask you to come down to the board.

MR. BAKER: Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: May we be heard?

THE COURT: All right.

MR. MEDVENE: Mr. Baker, in his questioning, implied that there was
some deception in the photographs shown to this witness and in terms
of the blood on the rear gate. And we want to direct his attention to
the board, which shows certain photographs that were taken on June 13.

Mr. Baker asked him if there were any photographs taken on June 13, as
I remember it, that reflect the blood on the back gate, and weren't
these photographs that he was shown taken at a different day, which
they were.

We want to show him the board, which has both photographs taken June
13 and July 3, and we want to ask him whether or not the blood drop
can be identified in which 115 appears -- does it actually appear on
the blowup of a blowup taken on June 13. That's the basis of the
question.

THE COURT: I don't even understand what you said.

MR. MEDVENE: What we said was, Your Honor, that when Mr. Baker
questioned the witness about the blood drop 115, he asked him whether
or not that picture was taken on June 13, and wasn't it really taken
several weeks later.

And we want to show the witness a picture that was taken June 13 and
ask him if the blood drop identified where 115 appears is the same
blood drop as appears in a blowup of the pictures taken on June 13.

THE COURT: Have you a picture of the same scene taken on the 13th?

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir. And we have a blowup.

THE COURT: Let me see it.

MR. MEDVENE: You want to see it?

THE COURT: Yeah.

(Pause in the proceedings.)

MR. MEDVENE: These pictures that were on the board are Exhibit 719.
This is a distance shot, the one in my left hand. The other two are
close-ups that were blown up.

One of the close-ups that we have on the board purports to show a spot
in the position of 115. When the pictures were originally taken June
13, they weren't taken for purposes of showing the blood. What we did
was take one of the original pictures that was shown to be blown up.
The blow-up, along with the other pictures, is what's on the board.
And the blowup, the June 13 picture shows the spot that, on July 3, is
marked with the property marker 113 -- excuse me -- 115. And that's
all we wanted to show him.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, if we do this --

MR. MEDVENE: I'm not saying it clearly enough.

The pictures that I have as 719 were taken June 13. The one in the
middle is a blowup. That blowup purports to show the blood spot. The
July is marked 115. That's it in a nutshel.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'll be -- if we do this --

THE COURT: Here excuse me.

MR. BAKER: If this is allowed I get it under . So we can do it
tomorrow or whatever you want to do.

THE COURT: I don't understand the point that you're trying to get
across.

MR. MEDVENE: The point that we're trying to get across is, this blood
--

THE COURT: Your hand is covering the transmitter.

MR. MEDVENE: Sorry, Your Honor.

The point we're trying to get across is, a blood spot appears on the
photograph that was taken June 13.

THE COURT: Is this exhibit stipulated to?

MR. MEDVENE: I believe it is. I have to look, but I believe it is.

THE COURT: Okay. We're adjourned to 8:30 tomorrow.

Don't talk about the case. Don't form or express any opinions.

Let me remind you: Do not allow yourself to be influenced by any
outside influences like newspapers television, broadcast media, or
family members or anybody else. Don't let them talk to you about this
case; don't talk to them about the case.

All right. See you tomorrow, 8:30.

MR. MEDVENE: Judge, if the Court please, if you want to hold the jury
for just --

THE COURT: Just a minute, for Mr. Baker.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, what we can do is, do it with
another witness, and we can release the witness.

THE COURT: Okay.

I just excused the jury.

MR. BAKER: Excuse them for the evening. I

don't want to excuse him yet.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: You're ordered to return tomorrow at 8:30.

(At 4:31 p.m., an adjournment was taken until Tuesday, October 29,
1996, at 8:30 A.M.)

REPORTER'S DAILY TRANSCRIPT
OCTOBER 29, 1996

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES


SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1996
8:53 AM

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE CLERK: Side bar?

MR. BAKER: Yes.

THE COURT: Morning.

MR. MEDVENE: Morning, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: For obvious reasons, Judge, I want Officer Thompson and
Officer Phillips excluded from the courtroom proceedings. I don't
think there is any reason for them to be in here. We've had a lot of
inconsistencies between the police officers. Those police officers
were here yesterday; they were out in the hall. They now, in my view,
want to get them in the courtroom so they can hear the other
testimony, to minimize the inconsistencies. I'd like them excused,
both Thompson and Phillips.

MR. MEDVENE: There was a previous order by Your Honor, as I remember
it, that if the witness was a witness at the criminal trial, he could
sit in.

THE COURT: Why do they need to be inside today?

MR. MEDVENE: They don't have to be inside.

THE COURT: Let's keep them outside.

MR. MEDVENE: That would be fine.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

JURORS: Morning.

MR. BAKER: One more housekeeping item.

We have as Exhibit 2101, a statement from Officer Terrazas that he
gave, written out June 13, 1994, at 0420 in the morning, move that
into evidence.

(The instrument herein described as a statement from Officer Terrazas
dated June 13, 1994, at 0420 was marked for identification as
Defendant's Exhibit No. 2101.)

MR. MEDVENE: There is no objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: Hold on. I think that might not be the right number.

MR. BAKER: I got that from Erin.

MR. PETROCELLI: We have no objection.

THE COURT: It is received.

(Statement of Miguel Terrazas dated June 13, 1994, received in
evidence as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2101.)

THE COURT: Officer or Sergeant Rossi.

THE CLERK: Please state your name again for the record.

And you are still under oath.

THE WITNESS: My name is David R. Rossi.

What was the last thing you asked me?

THE CLERK: I repeated you're still under oath.

THE WITNESS: Oh, yes. Thank you.

DAVID ROSSI, previously duly sworn, resumed the stand and testified
further as follows: BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Sergeant Rossi, you mentioned yesterday, you were assigned to West
L.A. What does West Los Angeles cover, as far as the LAPD is
concerned?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Outside the scope, relevancy.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. West Los Angeles covers the areas of Westwood and Brentwood,
Pacific Palasades, and a little portion of South down by Palms area.

Q. And does the West L.A. branch of the LAPD have a detective
division?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. There's been reference -- you made reference yesterday to the
robbery/homicide division. Where are they located?

A. Robbery/homicide works out of Parker Center, downtown Los Angeles.

Q. What is robbery/homicide, as you understand?

A. Robbery/homicide is a division that handles major crimes involving
robbery and homicide.

Q. And to your knowledge, what was the primary reason that the double
murder of Ms. Brown and Mr. Goldman was transferred to the
robbery/homicide division from West Los Angeles?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Hearsay, speculation, outside the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) What was your understanding of why it was
transferred?

MR. BAKER: Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

His understanding has no relevance.

MR. MEDVENE: May we be heard, Your Honor?

THE COURT: No.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You made reference to a conversation with Officer
Riske yesterday, and I want to direct you to that conversation.

Did you discuss -- strike that.

Did Officer Riske discuss with you, in talking about the double
murder, that one of the victims might be related to or involved in
some way with O.J. Simpson?

A. Yes, sir; he said it was possible.

Q. Was that your initial conversation with him?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, when you went to 870 South Bundy, early morning hours of June
13, did you notice at the scene what you thought was blood?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Fresh blood?

A. Yes.

Q. How would you identify it?

Why do you think it was fresh blood?

A. Because it was very, very red in color, and it still appeared quite
moist.

Q. And where did you see it?

A. Initially, on the walkway, outside of the location.

Q. Do you have any experience in recognizing blood?

A. As far as -- as far as what? What do you mean?

Q. Well, recognizing blood, as opposed to berry juice or something
like that.

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object, Your Honor. It's outside the scope;
it's 2034; and it's irrelevant, in view of the Court's ruling
yesterday.

THE COURT: I think it's outside the scope of the cross-examination.

Why are we revisiting the whole thing from the beginning?

MR. MEDVENE: Well, it was a preliminary to my next question, Your
Honor. I can go right to the next question, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) What was it about the stains you testified about
on the rear gate that you saw on the 13th, that made you believe what
you saw was blood?

A. They appeared to be blood drops and/or smears.

I was several feet away from it when I looked at it with a flashlight,
and Officer Riske told me it was blood. I didn't get real close to
investigate it.

MR. BAKER: Move to strike everything Officer Riske told him. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled. That shows the basis on which this officer had
state of mind. It's received for that purpose only.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) When Officer Riske pointed out with his
flashlight, was that in connection with walking through and showing
you the crime scene?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did he ever kneel down and point to the specific spot that he
thought was blood?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. Does the picture you saw which was put on the board yesterday, that
I would represent to you was taken July 3, several weeks after you
observed the blood --

MR. BAKER: I object, Your Honor. What picture are we talking about?
Vague and ambiguous.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Do you recall yesterday being directed to a
picture of the rear gate and asked if you recognized the rear gate and
what was on it?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, there were at least three pictures that we had
of the rear gate. This is vague and ambiguous, too.

THE COURT: Be more specific.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Would you put up on the board -- let me put a new
Exhibit up.

MR. MEDVENE: Would you put on the board, Exhibit 82?

THE WITNESS: Where is it?

MR. BAKER: No, no. It's on the screen, Officer. I think that's 82. I'm
here.

THE WITNESS: Put this on the board?

What do you mean, put it on the board?

MR. MEDVENE: We want to put it on the screen, not you.

MR. CALLAN: He was talking to you, not him.

MR. MEDVENE: I'm sorry.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, too.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you tell us whether or not this picture, taken
several weeks after you observed the blood, appears the same or
different than the blood that you saw on June 13, just in terms of its
color?

MR. BAKER: I object. That was asked and answered yesterday.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. You're asking me if it's the same color?

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yeah. Does it look the same as this picture, taken
two, three weeks later, as it did to you on June 13?

A. I believe the color looks darker; however, the stains or the drops
look the same.

Q. But the color looks darker?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay. Thank you.

Did you make -- strike that.

About how much time did you spend by the rear gate on your
walk-through with Officer Riske?

A. Less than a minute. I just passed by it.

Q. And did you make any specific note of exactly where the blood was
that you recall seeing on the gate on June 13?

A. Do you mean written note or mental note?

Q. Yes, written.

A. No, sir.

Q. Is there any question in your mind, as you sit here today, that you
recall seeing fresh blood on the bottom rung of the rear gate on June
13, when you took the brief walk-through with Officer Riske?

A. No, sir, no question.

MR. MEDVENE: I have nothing further.

Thank you very much.

MR. BAKER: Can I have Exhibit 2100, as well.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Now, Officer, or Sergeant -- I apologize -- Sergeant Rossi, last
evening, did you go over to the Doubletree Hotel and talk to these
gentlemen about your testimony last night?

A. No, sir.

Q. You haven't talked to them since you got off the witness stand
yesterday?

A. No, I haven't.

Q. Now, did anybody indicate to you -- and let the record indicate I'm
putting 2100 in front of Officer Rossi -- where you've initialed it,
anyone indicate to you that the areas that you circled were, in fact,
rust spots; they weren't blood at all?

A. No.

Q. And would it -- well, that photo was taken on July 13 --

MR. KELLY: Third.

MR. BAKER: Third. I'm sorry.

This photo was taken -- I'll ask the clerk to mark it the next in
order.

THE CLERK: 2102.

(The photograph taken on June 13, 1994 was marked Defendant's Exhibit
2102 for identification.)

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) On 2102 -- this photograph was taken on the 13th of
June, 1994. And why don't you go up and tell us where are spots 116.

Where are they, Officer Rossi?

A. There appears to be one here. I didn't see it as well, though, on
this, as on this picture.

Q. In fact, what you see is spot 117, and there is no spot 116 on that
photograph taken on June 13, 1994; isn't that true, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative. I think Mr. Baker
unintentionally said 117. I don't know if he meant 115 or not, Your
Honor.

MR. BAKER: I messed up again, and I apologize.

115 is depicted on the picture of the horizontal rung of the gate in a
horizontal position.

THE COURT: Just a minute. Referring to?

MR. BAKER: 2102.

THE COURT: Otherwise the record not going to be clear.

MR. BAKER: I appreciate that. Thank you, sir.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And there is no spot that you circled as blood drops
116 in the photograph that was taken the day after the murders,
correct, sir?

A. There appears to be a drop there, yes, doesn't show as well.

Q. But it didn't appear to be the two drops that you circled on a
photograph that was taken three weeks later; would you agree or
disagree with that?

A. I disagree. It doesn't show on that picture.

Q. You believe if we had a better picture, Sergeant Rossi, we would
most certainly see the spots that you circled on Exhibit 2101, right?

A. I was there. There was blood, sir.

Q. You didn't answer my question, Sergeant. I said if we had a
picture, you believe that those spots that are lateral four inches or
so from the spot 115, that would absolutely show because you know it
was there, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Asked and answered, argumentative.

THE COURT: It is argumentative. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You agree, 116, the two spots that are indicated on
Exhibit 2, and the dot that is indicated on 82, and the spots next to
the rung don't show at all on 2102, the actual photograph that was
taken the day after the murders; agreed?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Asked and answered several times.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No, sir; I disagree.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You think that both of those blood spots are shown
there, correct?

A. There appears to be at least one.

Q. Okay. That's the point. There are not two, there are not three, nor
are there four blood drops in photograph 2102. You would agree with
that, would you not?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Your Honor, the picture doesn't show the whole
gate for what purpose it was taken.

MR. BAKER: I object to his interpretation of what the picture shows.

THE COURT: I'll sustain in the form that question is asked. If you
were a little more precise, the objection would not be sustained.

I think the question, as posed, asks the officer to testify that the
spots are not there, as opposed to the spots do not appear on the
photograph. That's the basis on which the Court sustains the
objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You do not see any of the purported blood spots on
2102 photograph taken by Police Department on the third -- 13th of
June, 1994, that corresponds with any of what you say are blood spots
No. 116; correct or incorrect?

A. Incorrect, sir.

Q. Okay. You see them.

Okay. Now, did you dispatch Officer Gonzalez and Officer Ashton to
Rockingham at 0520 hours on the morning of the 14th?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: I'll rephrase.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you dispatch Officers Gonzalez and Ashton to 360
360 North Rockingham at 5:20 in the morning on the 13th?

A. No.

Q. Never did that?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. YOU didn't dispatch any black and white to go knock on doors at
Rockingham?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. That's a different question.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Pardon?

THE COURT: The objection was what?

MR. MEDVENE: The question was misleading. He said did you dispatch
Ashton and Gonzalez. And then the next question was, are you saying --

THE COURT: You're saying it sounded like the same question?

MR. MEDVENE: Yes.

THE COURT: It does.

MR. BAKER: I'll ask a different question.

THE COURT: Ask it like a different question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you dispatch any black and white to 360 North
Rockingham at 5:20 or thereabouts in the morning of the 13th of June
of 1994?

A. Not to my recollection.

Q. You wouldn't have had any reason to do that, as you sit here now,
looking back?

A. No.

Q. Thank you.

MR. BAKER: Nothing further.

MR. MEDVENE: Nothing further, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You're excused. Thank you.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I want to keep this witness on call.

THE COURT: You may.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I would move in 2102 and request that the jury
get to view 2102.

THE COURT: Stipulation to foundation?

MR. MEDVENE: Would you please put up 170?

and point out any of the smears that would appear on that photo?

A. This is the initial smear that I observed. And as it grew lighter,
I observed a secondary smear here.

Q. I'm here. If we can take it in parts, then maybe I'll have you mark
it. But could you describe some, so you do it justice, where the
initial smear was? And maybe, if you wouldn't mind, use the marker 30,
even though it wasn't there that day as a to point of reference? And
it's 31 as a point of reference?

A. Yes.

MR. P. BAKER: This is leading, Judge.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: First observed the area just to the left of marker number
30. That area lies along the side of the center console area which is
this here.

As it got lighter, I observed a secondary smear to the rear of the
console on the same side, just below the marker here which is 31.

I also observed a spot right here on the driver seat, which isn't
marked with anything.

To take that back, this is the passenger seat.

Q. What you're pointing out, would that be -- would that be, if you're
looking at the picture, I'd -- about -- I'll have you mark it in a
moment -- About 9 o'clock?

A. That would be about 9 o'clock on the television screen.

Q. Now, the various smears that you identified, what did they appear
to you to be?

purposes of having him mark it?

THE COURT: You may.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Officer Thompson, I'm placing in front of you,
what's been marked 170 and ask -- and I'm sorry, if I would mark it in
the place that -- places you just discussed. And will put it back up
so we make sure you have all the spots where you have the blood. And
you might see it in red. Is red any better? (Indicating to pen.)
Whichever is clearer.

A. I'll try yellow first.

THE COURT: Okay.

(Witness marks exhibit 170.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You put your initials wherever you put a circle.
(Witness complies. Marks photo in red.)

MR. MEDVENE: May I approach freely, Your Honor?

out to me.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. MEDVENE: We'll withdraw the question.

THE COURT: Is the exhibit that this witness was marking 170 or some
other exhibit?

MR. MEDVENE: The exhibit the witness was marking was 170. The original
exhibit and the marked exhibit, we gave the new number, 2103. 170 is
the exhibit without any marking. 2103 is the exhibit with the yellow
marks that Officer Thompson put on it.

THE COURT: So are there going to be two exhibits?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Two exhibits the way we understood it, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. MEDVENE: It was desired that there be different numbers?

THE COURT: I saw you take it from the projector and have it worked on
by this witness. So that's why I was wondering.

Okay. Go ahead.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Officer Thompson. I want to take you now from the
Bronco to the Rockingham driveway area.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes, I did.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you make any observations?

A. Yes.

Q. And what were those observations?

A. I saw additional spots in the driveway.

Q. And what did those additional spots appear to be?

A. Those spots appeared to be blood.

Q. I think the board is difficult for everyone to see. What I'd like
you to do, I wonder if it would help any if we had the lights down.
Could we have the lights down, with Your Honor's permission, to see if
that helps at all; the glare?

Officer Thompson, what I'm going to ask you to do is to approach the
board with the pointer, if you would.

And as you describe, I'd like you to describe each picture and what
blood you saw. What I'm going to do on each picture is also have that
particular picture put up on the screen so the jurors that are not
able to see the board, can see the screen.

First you see the diagram in the -- in the center of the pictures?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And what I'd like to you do is go up to the top picture on the left
hand corner. Which is exhibit 156. And if you could, point out for us
what, if anything, you observed in 156.

A. I observed a droplet at this location, behind the Bronco, directly
in front of curb on Rockingham. Which is depicted right there by the
car.

Q. When you say it's depicted, it's depicted how?

A. The location is depicted right there.

Q. Where the marker is?

A. Yes.

Q. Was the marker there when you first saw that drop of blood?

A. No, it wasn't.

Q. Is that the drop of blood pointed out to you by Detective Fuhrman?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, the other drops of blood you saw, did you find those yourself?

A. I did find some drops of blood myself, yes.

Q. All right. You've now dealt with the top pictures on the Bronco.
Let me move down one to the picture below it, if I can. Which is 157.
And what is that?

A. This is -- this seems to be a photograph that depicts a close-up of
the drop that I saw behind the Bronco.

(The instrument herein described as Photograph of ground and ruler was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 157.)

Q. There's a red line, appears to be a Bronco. What does that red dot
represent to the best of your knowledge?

A. It depicts the location in perspective to the entire property here.

Q. Now, let's go, if we can, to the picture below it. In other words,
the third picture going down on the left hand side, facing the board,
which is 158.

A few of the Rockingham entry with what appear to be three cards.

Q. We'll put -- we've put 158 on the board. Could you tell us what you
saw, if anything, at the location where those three cards are?

was marked For identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 159.)

Q. Let me place up for you, closeups to those three cards, if we can.
First, exhibit 159.

Let me back up, if I can, Officer Thompson 'cause I don't believe we
have closeups of those three spots. But if you can, the three spots
you just depicted, where do they show, on the schematic or the board,
if you can point that out to us?

A. On this diagram, they're depicted here.

Q. And when you say "here?"

A. Here. I mean just on the outside of the front gate and just beyond
the front gate. There were two.

Q. Okay. Where we'll go now is, did you observe, early morning hours,
a vehicle on Mr. Simpson's driveway?

Q. Was one of the vehicles colored black?

(The instrument herein described as close-up of Rockingham driveway
with Card C was marked For identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
162.)

A. C is a card that depicts the location of two droplets that were
found at this location in the driveway and that would be here on the
diagram.

Q. Let's go now to the -- to the bottom right. And would you place 163
on the board, please?

Can you please describe what that is and where you saw that?

A. I'm sorry. The answer to your last question was yes.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

This is a new exhibit number. We'll mark it next in order, 2105.

MR. BAKER: -05.

MR. P. BAKER: -04.

(Daily Activities Report dated June 13, 1994 for Officer Thompson,

darkened out, Officer?

Q. What unit number were you assigned to?

A. I was assigned to 8 Adam 95.

Q. And you then proceeded later that day to 874 South Bundy?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And if you hold up this document to the light, you can see through
the darkened part. And that reads "874 South Bundy," correct, Officer?

A. Yes. That's the 874 -- looks like the location across the street
from 875.

Q. Do you know which officers you relieved at 874 South Bundy on the
morning of June 13, 1994?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection; relevance, materiality, which officers they
relieved.

THE COURT: You asked it on direct. Overruled.

A. We didn't relieve any officers at 874; it was 875, which is the
location.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Okay.

A. Rear of 875.

Q. So you relieved a couple officers at the rear of 875 South Bundy?

A. I have no idea what they were assigned to.

THE COURT REPORTER: Is that eight?

MR. P. BAKER: Number 8, Adam 95.

THE WITNESS: That's very possible. If they were working the shift
before the shift I was working, it's very likely.

Q. That would be at 8 Adam 95; is that true?

A. That's possible.

Q. I believe you testified you spent the duration of your time at 875
South Bundy in the back alleyway; is that correct?

Q. Where else did you go, Officer.

A. I went inside the location.

Q. Why did you go inside?

A. I was asked to.

A. Detective Lange.

Q. And what did he order you to do?

A. He asked me to look for a sheet.

Q. Did you look for a sheet?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what did you find?

A. I found a sheet or blanket upstairs, in a linen hamper, linen
closet.

Q. Did he tell you what he wanted that sheet for?

A. Yes.

Q. What was that?

A. It was to cover the body of Nicole Simpson.

Q. He was asking to you go inside the residence and get a sheet from
the residence to take to the crime scene, correct?

A. Well, the residence is a part of the crime scene, also.

Q. Well, he was asking you to get a blanket and take it where the
bodies were; isn't that true, Officer?

A. Well, he didn't ask me to take it to the bodies; he asked me to get
the blanket for him.

Q. What was the color of blanket that you got, Officer?

A. I'm sorry; ask again.

Q. What was the color of the blanket you got?

A. White.

Q. Did you ever come to an understanding that that white blanket was
used on the bodies at the crime scene?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. You'd been an officer for about seven years on June 13, 1994; isn't
that true?

A. That's true.

Q. Did it ever cross your mind that hair and fibers of anybody who had
ever used the blanket would be transferred to the crime scene?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) You did come to an understanding that that white
blanket was placed on the bodies?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Misstates the evidence, assumes facts not in
evidence.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Where did you park your cars on Bundy Avenue and
on that morning?

A. Our car was parked in the rear.

Q. Did you ever walk to the front of the residence?

A. Yes.

Q. And when did you walk to the front of the residence?

A. On my initial arrival.

Q. How did you get to the front of the residence?

A. I drove.

Q. You parked your car in the alleyway and then you drove around to
the front?

A. No; we initially parked in the front of the residence, and shortly
thereafter, we drove the car to the rear.

Q. Okay. Did you ever walk into the area where the bodies were found?

A. Would you rephrase that question?

Q. Were you ever within five feet of where the bodies were?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you have boots on that today?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Did you have gloves on that today?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Were any criminalists already at the scene when you were five feet
from the bodies?

A. No.

Q. Was the coroner's office there when you were five feet from the
body?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor.

A. Oh, maybe about 15 seconds, 20 seconds.

Q. And how did you get to that area?

Q. Okay. Did you ever walk on the sidewalk?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever walk on the walkway to the north of the residence?

north side walkway; is that true?

A. Near the bodies, no.

Q. Okay. How did you get to the back alley at that point?

A. I went to the front, walked to the front, and then I entered my

A. For the duration of the time; I stayed there up till about 8
o'clock or so.

Q. How many times did you enter the house?

A. Once.

Q. How many officers were inside the house?

A. When I entered, I don't recollect any officers being there in the
house, with the possible exception of Detective Lange.

Q. Detective Lange may have been inside the house?

A. Yes.

Q. Were they using the house as a command center, as far as you know?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: We'll open with this witness on that area.

THE COURT: You can open with it when it becomes your turn.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) You got the blanket out of the closet; is that
correct?

A. It was a linen closet on the second floor.

Q. Where was the closet?

A. Near a bathroom.

Q. Near a bathroom?

A. Yes, near a bathroom, and what seemed to be the children's bedroom.

Q. So that was upstairs?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you see any candles in that bathroom?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. P. BAKER: We'll open, judge.

THE COURT: You can open when you call him as your witness.

MR. P. BAKER: I want to save some time and not bring him back down
here. It will only be a couple minutes.

THE COURT: Go ahead.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Did you see if candles were burning, Officer
Thompson --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, whether the candles
were burning.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I didn't answer the first question if I saw candles in the first
place.

And the answer to that is no.

Q. You never saw candles in the bathroom?

A. I don't recollect seeing any candles in the bathroom.

Q. Did you ever see water in the bathtub, Officer Thompson?

A. I didn't look inside the bathtub, so, no.

Q. When you walked inside the house, how did you get to the upstairs
portion of the house?

A. Walked up some stairs.

Q. Did you enter -- I'm sorry; the question was bad.

Did you enter through the garage, or did you walk around the walkway?

A. I entered through the garage.

Q. Did you see an ice cream cup on the bannister of the lower area of
the condominium?

A. No.

Q. How many times did you enter the condominium, sir?

A. One time.

Q. And how many times did you walk on the north walkway of the
residence, sir?

A. I think you need to rephrase that question.

Q. What about that question don't you understand?

A. You're asking me if I walked along the north walkway. I didn't walk
along the north walkway.

Q. How many times were you on the north walkway on the northern part
of the condominium?

A. Once.

Q. And that was at the rear of the location?

A. And that was the rear of the location.

Q. In the driveway?

A. Not in the driveway, toward the rear fence, the rear gate.

Q. Did you walk through the fence?

A. A few feet, yes.

Q. Who opened the fence for you, or did you open it yourself?

A. The fence was open; I didn't touch it.

Q. Which way did it open? Did it open towards Bundy, or did it open
towards the alley?

A. I don't remember how it opened.

Q. Who was there when you walked through the fence?

A. No one.

Q. You were just standing there alone?

A. I was there alone in that immediate vicinity, yes. My partner was
in the car at the rear of the location, so she may have been maybe
within 20 feet of me.

Q. As far as you know, Angela Guzman, was she able, if she looked, to
see you standing near the fence?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusion.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Where was Detective Lange when you walked through
the fence area?

A. I don't know.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Did you see any blood -- strike that. There was
no blood on the mesh of the fence, was there, on June 13, 1994?

A. Well, I saw some smears on the mesh. I couldn't decide if it was
blood or not.

Q. You could decide that the blood was on the bottom rail; is that
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. I want to show you an exhibit, which is photograph 2102.

(The instrument herein described as a photograph of walkway marked for
identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2102.)

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Did Ed Medvene or Dan Petrocelli show you a
photograph this morning, or a copy of this photograph this morning,
Officer?

A. No.

Q. Didn't tell that you that photograph was taken on June 13, 1994?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. He said he wasn't --

THE COURT: What's the objection? I can't hear you.

MR. MEDVENE: The witness has said he wasn't shown the photo this
morning. The question was just, did they tell you such and such.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) How many blood drops did you see on the bottom
rail of that photograph, Officer Thompson?

A. May I get up and --

Q. You certainly may.

A. -- and look closely?

Thank you.

It's too hard to tell what is in that area. There's too much grain
there in the photograph.

Q. Okay. Well, let me show you a close-up of that photograph, Exhibit
719.

How many blood drops do you see on that bottom rail?

A. Well, I can't see the entire bottom rail. It looks like this is
only the last foot and a half of the bottom rail.

There's more down here. I'd like to see a photograph that shows --

Okay. (Referring to view screen.)

Q. Good enough?

A. Yes. (Witness reviews view screen.)

Okay. I see a spot here, but I can't tell what that is.

Q. That's the only spot you see, correct, Officer Thompson?

A. Yes, on this photograph.

Q. Thank you.

You subsequently --

By the way, did you wear any boots when you were in that --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: You asked that question already.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) I'm not done.

Did you wear any boots when you were on the rear walkway, north
walkway?

A. Near the rear.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Move to strike.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) You then went to 360 North Rockingham; is that
true?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. You didn't change your clothes at all on the way to 360 North
Rockingham, did you?

A. No.

Q. What time did you arrive at 360 North Rockingham?

A. About five minutes after 8:00, 8 o'clock.

Q. On your field activities report, the portion that is darkened out
--

MR. P. BAKER: Let me actually show that to Mr. Medvene. I'm sorry.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) First, what does that field activities report say
for the purpose of you going to Rockingham?

A. States a follow-up from the previous incident on Bundy.

Q. Okay. I'm sorry; my question was vague.

A. Yes.

Q. What was the disposition of what you were to do at 360 North
Rockingham? It's in the darkened area, if you would like hold it up to
the light.

A. Protect a secondary crime scene, start a crime-scene log.

Q. Did you start the crime-scene log, Officer Thompson?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. And you arrived at about 8 o'clock in the morning?

A. Little after 8 o'clock, yes.

Q. Okay. I want to show you what is marked as Exhibit 200; it's a
crime-scene log.

What time did that crime-scene log say that you arrived at 360 North
Rockingham, Officer?

(The instrument herein described as crime scene police log was marked
for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 200.)

A. That log states that I arrived at 11:45, which is not true.

Q. So that crime-scene log is inaccurate?

A. I'm sorry? Say again.

Q. That crime-scene log is inaccurate?

A. I'm not saying the log is inaccurate; all I'm saying is that --

MR. KELLY: Excuse me, Mr. Baker. Could you please leave it up there
while he's still testifying.

Thank you.

A. I'm saying that the time depicted beside my unit, 8 Adam 5, which
shows me and my partner arriving at 11:45 is inaccurate.

Q. Did you see Detective Fuhrman there before 11:45, Officer?

A. Yes.

Q. And so with that log, Exhibit 200, that has Detective Fuhrman
arriving at least after 12 o'clock, that would be inaccurate, as well?

A. Well, I can't even read the time that it says Detective Fuhrman
arrived.

Q. You would agree that Detective Fuhrman was certainly there before
12 o'clock, true?

A. Yes, I would say that. Yes.

Q. In fact, it was Detective Fuhrman who pointed out the first blood
spot to you; isn't that true, Officer Thompson?

A. Yes.

Q. Did it ever cross your mind why Detective Fuhrman was at 360
Rockingham, in light of the robbery/homicide division had already
taken over the case?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusion, argumentative.

THE COURT: Jury to disregard that question.

The question assumes an argumentative position and it's inappropriate.

Please desist from that.

MR. P. BAKER: I apologize.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Where were you when you saw the blood smears in
the Bronco, Officer?

A. I was standing just outside of the passenger window when I saw the
initial blood smears inside the Bronco on the center console.

Q. Okay. And you arrived -- it was sunny there when you arrived at 360
North Rockingham, wasn't it?

A. The sun was up.

Q. In fact, the sun came up on June 13, 1994, at 5:41 a.m.; isn't that
true?

A. You have to ask the Farmer's Almanac on that one. (Laughter.)

MR. BAKER: I'd like the Court to take a note of that time, sunrise at
5:41.

THE COURT: I don't have any basis.

MR. BAKER: I'll give you that, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) You were looking pretty closely inside that
Bronco; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You were trying to see whatever you could find inside the Bronco
when you arrived on the morning of June 13 1994, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you looked to see if the Bronco was locked, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember testifying in the criminal case of People of the
State of California versus us Donald Thompson, on July 18, 1995?

A. Versus me?

Q. Oh, versus O.J. Simpson.

(Laughter.)

Q. (MR. P. BAKER) 37549.

Do you remember testifying at the criminal trial on July 18, 1995,
Officer?

A. Yes, I do.

What line?

Q. It's right here at the bottom.

I don't have the right page.

Lines right here, on 23, 25.

Let to me read to you from page 37549, lines 23 through 25.

"Q. Do you know whether or not the Bronco was locked?

"A. I don't know if it was locked or not."

Does that refresh your recollection, Officer?

A. That's true.

Q. Now, as I understand it, you observed blood on the Bronco console,
on the Bronco passenger seat, true?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: 2103.

MR. P. BAKER: It's 2103.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) I was going to show it to you real quick before I
put it on the screen.

A. Okay.

(Witness reviews document.)

Q. You saw blood on the console, Officer Thompson, or what you
believed to be blood?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And you saw what you believed to be blood on the passenger seat,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And how long was it between seeing the initial -- between your
first observation of what you believed to be blood and your second
observation?

A. Well, I'd say within about an hour or so, as it got lighter.

Q. And on both occasions, were you looking through the passenger-side
window?

A. To obtain this view, yes.

Q. Did you look through the Bronco -- through any other windows?

A. Yes, through the driver's-side window, also.

Q. When did you look through the driver's-side window?

A. I looked through the driver's-side window the same time I looked
through the passenger-side window.

Q. You walked around the front of the Bronco and looked through the
front?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Now, there was a number of media there that morning; is that
correct?

A. When I arrived?

Q. Well when you were looking through the Bronco.

A. When I arrived, there were two free-lance photographers there.

Q. Okay. Were there any camera people there when you arrived?

A. Video?

Q. Video camera.

A. Video camera. Not to my knowledge.

Q. When you looked through the Bronco on the second occasion, were
there any video-camera personnel?

A. I'm not sure.

Q. All right. Well, you were there from about 8:00 to 3:30 in the
afternoon; is that true, Officer?

A. That is, yes.

Q. How many media personnel would you say were there, at a maximum,
during the day?

A. Possibly as many people as in this courtroom. At least.

Q. Hundred, 150?

A. There were a lot of people there. There were dozens and dozens.

Q. And they were pretty unruly, true?

A. Some were. Most weren't.

Q. Okay. But you had a hard time controlling the media, correct?

A. Some, but not all.

Q. All right. And what portion of Rockingham were assigned to secure?

A. The front entrance.

Q. Around the Bronco?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. And you and Officer Guzman were ordered to secure the
area around the Bronco, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Were you able, during your entire time there, capable of preventing
people from touching the Bronco?

A. Myself?

Q. Yes.

A. For the most part, yes.

Q. Well, at one point in the day, you observed coffee cups on the hood
of the Bronco; isn't that true?

A. That's true.

Q. And you had to give the coffee cups to a news photographer or news
media representative, didn't you?

A. I'm sorry; repeat that question.

Q. And you -- I'm sorry; it was bad.

And you returned the coffee cups to the reporter who had placed them
there, didn't you?

A. Well, I directed the person to the coffee cups that were on the
cars -- on the Bronco.

Q. I'm sorry; I didn't hear that.

A. I directed them to the Bronco, showing them the cups on it.

Q. You didn't give her back the cup of coffee?

A. Well --

THE COURT: What's the relevance of this, whether he gave it back to
her or she took it or whatever?

MR. P. BAKER: This is how you secure --

THE COURT: Well, let's get on with it.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) Did you see anyone touch the Bronco?

A. I saw someone come very close. I couldn't tell if they did touch it
or not.

(Witness reviews documents.)

Q. Did you get a chance to review that?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Is there any mention of any observation of what you believed to be
blood in the Bronco in that report?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative.

MR. MEDVENE: And lack of foundation, Your Honor.

THE WITNESS: No, this is --

THE COURT: Excuse me just a minute.

MR. MEDVENE: It's Officer Phillips' report, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. P. BAKER) What time did you see what you believe to be

A. That was shortly after my arrival.

Q. You didn't photograph any of the blood, correct?

A. No.

Q. You didn't mark any of the blood?

A. Mark the blood?

Q. You know, put the cards up that are in the photos.

A. No.

Q. Okay. You didn't collect any of the blood that you identified

A. No.

Q. Okay. Now, you stated earlier that you saw two blood drops in this
photograph; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Or what appear to be -- what you believe were blood drops?

A. Yes.

Q. I ask that you mark, sir, what you believe were blood drops, in
that photograph.

MR. P. BAKER: What Exhibit is this?

MR. BLASIER: 162.

MR. P. BAKER: 162.

THE WITNESS: With this?

MR. P. BAKER: Your highlighter works great.

(Witness marks Exhibit 162.)

MR. MEDVENE: I'm unclear. Is the witness looking at 162, the blow-up

THE COURT: I haven't the faintest.

MR. P. BAKER: It's the bottom.

MR. PETROCELLI: What Exhibit number?

MR. P. BAKER: It's Exhibit 162. It's this photograph which you
referred to earlier with the C.

Why don't you put your initials right here, just for the record.

(Witness complies.)

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

(Mr. Medvene reviews document marked by witness.)

MR. P. BAKER: Your Honor, I'd like to mark this next in order, as
2104.

MR. BAKER: Five.

THE CLERK: Five.

MR. P. BAKER: 2105.

(Photograph of blood drops at 360 North Rockingham was marked
Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2105 for identification.)

Q. You observed two blood drops in that photograph, Officer Thompson?

A. Yes; I observed what appears to be two blood drops in that
photograph.

Q. And the blood drops that you observed which are documented in that
photograph appear to be of the same consistency of the blood you
observed throughout Rockingham?

A. It's one under the card, C, yes.

Q. The other, what you believe to be a blood drop, does not have the
same consistency of the other blood drops at 360 North Rockingham?

A. It doesn't look like it from this photograph.

Q. Is the blood drops -- strike that.

Which blood drop of Exhibit 2104 -- 2105 is most consistent with the
blood you observed at Bundy?

A. May I use the pointer?

Q. Sure.

A. That one right there.

Q. All right. Witness is pointing to the lower blood drop of Exhibit
2105.

Did that appear to be of the same consistency of the blood you saw, or
which you had marked earlier which you noted at 360 North Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. And did it appear to be the same consistency of the blood you
observed at Bundy?

A. For the most part, yes. It looked different because that's a porous
driveway. The blood I saw on the fence wasn't -- the fence isn't
porous, so the blood takes a different appearance when you look at it.

Q. Did you ever come to any conclusion on June 13, 1994, where the
right-hand glove was found?

A. I'm sorry; repeat that.

Q. Sure.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: What is the question?

MR. P. BAKER: You want me to rephrase it?

THE COURT: I would like to hear what the question was.

(Record read by the reporter as follows:)

MR. MEDVENE: All right, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Really, more than things in case.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did there come a time when you met with any of the
detectives at the West Los Angeles homicide?

A. Yes. I arrived at West Los Angeles about 1:50 in the morning. I met
Mark Fuhrman at that station at about 1:55 in the morning.

Q. And did you and Detective Fuhrman ride somewhere?

A. Yes. I went out and picked up the homicide vehicle that was
assigned to us. Put some items into it, flashlights, notebooks, things
of that nature; and we drove to 875 south Bundy together.

Q. And when you arrived, did you speak with anyone?

A. I arrived. I first noticed Sergeant Dave Rossi was the watch
commander at West Los Angeles. I walked up to him, basically asked him
what had happened, what had -- what he knew and asked him if he could
show me what the first responding officer that knew the most
information about this crime scene was.

Q. Who did he direct you to?

A. Officer Bob Riske.

Q. Did you request a walk through of the Bundy scene?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Prior to starting that walk through, did you have any phone
conversations with anyone?

A. Sergeant Rossi was on the phone with an individual at the time I
walked up to him. He was mentioning the individual's name. He was
calling him Commander Bushey. He then handed me the telephone and told
me that the commander wished to talk to me.

Q. And at the end of your -- did you speak with Commander Bushey?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. At the end of your conversation with Commander Bushey, what was
your understanding of West L.A. detectives role in this case.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: He wanted to know if we had the resources at West Los
Angeles to handle homicide and I told the commander that I had just
arrived, hadn't done a walk through. I knew nothing.

And he again asked me if we had the resources. I said I don't know. I
have not done a walk-through yet. I'll make -- have to make a
walk-through and I'll get in touch with you again.

And then he said that it turned out to be the wife or the former wife
of O.J. Simpson. He wanted to make sure that I notified Mr. Simpson in
person about the death of his exwife or wife. That I did not want the
news media to make that notation or have him find out any other way.

Q. Shortly thereafter, did you commence your walk-through?

A. Yes. Officer Riske took me on a walk-through.

MR. MEDVENE: May I approach, Your Honor, to put up a chart?

THE COURT: All right.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, may I go over to that side of the courtroom?

THE COURT: Sure.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Detective Phillips, if you wouldn't mind, could
you -- could you approach what's 205, victims bodies in relation to
each other at the crime scene and tell us, on your walk-through, what
you observed?

A. Well, the original walk-through that I took with Officer Riske went
through this area here, the foliage in the bushes, not on the walkway
itself, and walked up to this area in there where there was a call
box. That's as close as we approached either one of the bodies from
that location.

Q. And what did you see?

A. When we walked up, Sergeant or Officer Riski started pointing out
things. He originally pointed out the victim Nicole Brown. He shined
his flashlight over to the corner. He showed us victim Ron Goldman. He
then pointed out this envelope. He pointed out the glove that was
underneath this bush and also a knit cap.

He then told me that behind Mr. Goldman there was a set of keys laying
in this area back in here and also a pager.

Q. What was the source of light that was utilized to look at the
scene?

A. It -- well, there was a much more light on at the front door of the
residence, which is up on top of these stairs and off to your left.

This area down in here was relatively still dark, and it was early in
the morning, so we used our flashlights. I had a flashlight and
Officer Riske had one and so did Detective Fuhrman.

Q. How full were the flashlights in terms of the illumination they
gave to the scene?

A. Well, I have a mag light. A mag light, which I don't remember the
candle power of it which is bright. Riske had him -- had the same kind
and Mark Fuhrman had a smaller mag light.

Q. How would you describe the lighting conditions in terms of your
ability to see?

A. With the aid of the flashlight, we could see everything that was
being pointed out to us by Officer Riske very clearly.

Q. Where was Officer Fuhrman when Officer Riske was pointing out to
you whatever he was pointing out?

A. He was standing behind me. We approached this location where the
call box was there in single file with Officer Riske leading. I was
second and officer -- Detective Fuhrman was behind me. That's
basically the way we stood except for moving around a little bit to
look around each other.

Q. Did you see a second glove?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I just saw one glove, sir. That -- the glove underneath
this bush right in this area.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, after the observations that you made and
Officer Riske leading you through, where did you then go or what did
you then do?

A. We walked.

MR. BAKER: Objection. Calls for narrative.

THE COURT: Overruled. Go ahead.

THE WITNESS: I walked out the same way that I had walked in, back out
onto the grass walkway just off the street.

Riske had pointed out several portions where there was blood that they
had detected where a dog had run up and down a sidewalk. He pointed
that out to us. We were not walking on the sidewalk.

I then walked southbound on Bundy to a street called Dorothy and made
a right turn on Dorothy, which would take me westbound to the rear of
the condominium and walk northbound, up through an alley to the rear
of that residence.

Q. Who was with you?

A. Officer Riske and Detective Fuhrman.

Q. What did you then do?

A. When I arrived at the back, Officer Riske pointed out a black jeep
that was parked in the driveway. He pointed out that the right
passenger door was somewhat ajar like it hadn't closed all the way.

He then showed me, I believe it was a dime and a penny that was laying
in the driveway. Showed me a spot of -- couple spots of blood. And
then Sergeant Rossi took me to a rear gate and pointed out the gate.
We went inside the gate. We started to walk down the walkway to
explain to me how some foot prints had faded out and hadn't come back
out that far.

Q. How far did you walk down the walkway?

A. We didn't walk very far. We walked a short ways and I said is there
a better way to get into this location without walking through here?
And he said, yeah. And we went back out the gate and we met Fuhrman
and Riske, who were standing outside the gate, still looking at the
driveway.

Q. What did you then do?

A. He then took us to the garage door which was open. There was a
white Ferrari in the garage. We walked around that vehicle and entered
the residence, went through the garage door.

Q. Then what did you do?

A. As we walked in the back door, Officer Riske pointed out an ice
cream cup that was sitting on a banister and pointed out a spoon that
had fallen on the other side of the banister that was on a step
leading down a few steps that went into another room.

We walked up the steps into the kitchen area, through the kitchen
area, into the dining room area; the dinning room area into the living
room area and out the front door that was open.

Q. Did you notice any bloody footprints of any kind inside the house?

A. No, I did not.

MR. LEONARD: Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. MEDVENE: Did you notice any evidence of ransacking of any kind
inside the house.

MR. LEONARD: Same, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) So you're to the point, I think, Detective
Phillips, where you went out the front door?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Again, who was with you at that point and what do you do?

A. Officer Riske was leading. I was following him and Detective
Fuhrman was behind me. I walked out the front door into a landing area
which is just before the steps.

Q. Not by these steps. You're pointing to the steps that are shown in
the exhibits 2058?

A. Yes, there's a landing area up here and then these steps lead down
to the walkway. We stayed on the landing area and never walked down
the steps.

Q. Then what do you do?

A. From that location with the aid of the flashlights, Detective or
Officer Riske again pointed out certain items. You could see better
from that location up there above.

Q. Again, did you see a second glove?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: The only gloves I ever saw that day, sir, at the Bundy
location was that glove I pointed out previously.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Again, when these observations were being made up
at the landing, where was Officer Riske? Where were you? Where was
Detective Fuhrman?

A. We were all very closely knit together, standing there and
listening to Officer Riske tell us basically what he had seen and
pointing out items to us.

Q. After you made this next observation that you told us about, what
did you do?

A. He then said that there was footprints. Officer Riske then said
there were footprints that led westbound on the north side of the
condominium and also some blood drops that he had observed and wanted
to show us those. So we walked west.

Q. I'm sorry. If you can hold for a minute?

A. Sure.

Q. I place before you what's been marked 2059. It's titled 875 south
Bundy walkway. And could you pick me up, and in terms of where you
were in your description of, what you then did with Officer Riske and
with Detective Fuhrman?

A. Well, this area up in here is the landing I was referring to,
looking down these steps to where Ms. Simpson lay, here, and Mr.
Goldman was over here.

We then walked back this walkway here, leading westbound on the north
side of the condominium all the way back to this gate here. And as we
walked along, the footprints faded out. He showed us the faded
footprints as they faded out and also a few drops of blood that I had
noticed.

Q. And how far back did you go?

A. I walked with the other two officers all the way to the back gate.

Q. Now, did you, at that time or earlier on the first trip, observe
anything on the back gate.

MR. LEONARD: Objection, Your Honor. Compound and leading or he's
already -- he's already asked the question --

THE COURT: Rephrase it.

MR. LEONARD: -- What he did before.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you make any observation of the back gate?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what did you see?

A. I -- two droplets of blood were pointed out to me. Than on the
bottom rung on the inside of the gate, which would be the east side of
the gate, a smudge type of appearance was pointed out to me. Than on
the top rung of the gates, also on the east side of the gate, there
was some blood that was pointed out to me on the latch of the gate.

Q. Now, what did Officer Riske and Detective Fuhrman and yourself then
do?

A. At that time, we walked back out to the alley and Detective or
Officer Riske then took us back in through the house and showed us the
basic lay out of the house. And took us in all the rooms. Showed us
different items that were inside the house.

Q. And then what did you do?

A. I then exited the house with Officer Riske and Detective Fuhrman,
walked into the alley, which is outside this gate. Up here. There's an
alley behind there.

Q. By this gate, it's the top most picture in what I had identified as
2059, it's 2057; the exhibit.

Is that the gate in the rear picture?

(The instrument herein described as diagram of Bundy walkway was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2057.)

(The instrument herein described as copy of board showing the envelope
was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2059.)

A. We walked out this gate, out the driveway and out into the alley.

Q. All right, sir. And what did you do in the alley?

A. As I walked out into the alley, I was met by my commanding officer,
Lieutenant Spangler.

Q. Did you have a conversation with Lieutenant Spangler?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Could we have a yes or no? Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you also, at that time, have a conversation
with Detective Rossi?

A. Sergeant.

Q. With Sergeant Rossi?

A. Yes.

Q. As a result of those conversations, was a decision made as to
whether or not robbery/homicide would become involved in the
investigation?

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

Q. And what determination was made?

A. Lieutenant Frank Spangler, my commanding officer, informed me that
robbery homicide division -- he had made the decision that robbery
homicide division would handle this case. And for me to get in touch
with the robbery homicide commander and make the necessary
notification, which I did.

MR. LEONARD: I didn't hear the last part of the answer?

THE WITNESS: Which I did.

MR. LEONARD: Before that.

THE WITNESS: He asked me to get in touch with commanding officer of
robbery homicide division, which I did.

MR. LEONARD: Thought I heard something about notification. No, I want
to hear the last part.

THE COURT: Well, the -- have the -- would you like to have it read?

(The reporter read back requested

"A. Lieutenant Frank Spangler, my commanding officer, informed me that

A. Yes. We were all standing there at the same time.

Q. As a result of your speaking with Lieutenant Spangler and Sergeant

what we had at that location. Who may or may not be involved. And that
it was determined that it would be a high profile case and that they
were asking that his unit, his division take over the investigation.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Any discussion about the amount of man power
needed?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: Recall any further discussion at this time with Captain
Gartland?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: You can answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: He told me to do something else.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) What did he tell to you to do?

A. Told me to get in touch with Lieutenant John Rodgers who was the
on-call Lieutenant to talk to him about having one of his is teams
that was on call that evening respond at a location.

Q. Did you do that?

A. Yes.

Q. You called Lieutenant Rodgers?

A. Yes.

Q. And what did you say?

A. Told him the same thing I had told Captain Gartland and told him
that I talked to Captain Gartland and Captain Gartland had informed me
to call him to tell him that his officer would take over the
investigation of this homicide, double homicide.

Q. What did you then do?

A. I then walked into the residence where Mark Fuhrman and Brad
Roberts were at inside the condominium and informed them that the case
was no longer our responsibilities. That the decision had been made to
be -- robbery/homicide would now handle this investigation. And any
investigation that they were doing was to cease at that time. And we
were to leave the residence.

Q. And what did Detective Roberts and Fuhrman do?

A. Fuhrman at this time was taking notes. Writing some notes down. He
said give me one more minute to write another note down here that I've
got in my head and -- which he did.

And the three of us then left the residence and he handed me his notes
and told me that -- I told him to give me his notes. I would give them
to on one of the robbery/homicide detectives.

Q. Did he do that?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. What did you then do?

A. Walked southbound out of the alley to Dorothy and eastbound on
Dorothy out to the intersection of Bundy and Dorothy where all the
other police officers were standing.

Q. What occurred then?

A. Basically it had already been told to everybody that
robbery/homicide was now handling this case. That everybody was in a
stand down position. That just to maintain the security of the crime
scene and everybody was to stay in their positions. And that
robbery/homicide was sending some other detectives to do this
investigation.

Q. And you were waiting for the robbery/homicide detectives to arrive?

A. That's correct.

MR. MEDVENE: Court please, would this be a convenient time to break?

THE COURT: 1:30, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about the case.
Don't form or express any opinion.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ

HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE COURT: You may proceed.

RON PHILLIPS, previously called as a witness was sworn and testified
as follows:

DIRECT EXAMINATION (CONTINUED)

BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Good afternoon.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. Were Detectives Roberts, Noland and Fuhrman all under your
supervision?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. You said at the break that you're all standing outside waiting for
robbery/homicide to arrive. Why didn't you instruct the other
detectives and -- To just leave?

A. Well, the double homicide that occurred in West Los Angeles
division, we didn't know if robbery/homicide would need assistance or
even wanted our assistance.

Once they arrived, I instructed them to stay. I would talk to
robbery/homicide. If they wanted to us to leave, we would leave the
location. If they wanted us to stay and assist them, that's what we
would do.

Q. Approximately what time was it when you were all together outside
waiting for the robbery/homicide people to come?

A. Well, possibly 2:45, 2:50, somewhere in that vicinity. I think I
made the phone call to DHQ about 2:39, 2:39 in the morning.

Q. What time was it that Detective Vannatter arrived, approximately?

A. Detective Vannatter arrived at 4:05 in the morning.

Q. What transpired between 2:45, 2:50, whenever it was, when you're
all together outside and when Detective Vannatter arrived?

A. Well, the crime scene was basically secured. The officers all on
stationary post were left in those positions. The command staff of
west L.A was this the street at Dorothy and Bundy where I was; and
most of the officers that worked for me. I think at one time I sent
Detective Brad Roberts and Detective Noland back to West L.A. station
to conduct an interview of one individual.

And then we waited at that location until robbery/homicide showed up.
And I also directed a photographer to cover all outside photographs of
the Bundy crime scene, but not the crime scene itself.

Q. Now, when detective -- strike that.

Was Detective Fuhrman, to your knowledge, during this period of time
from 2:45, 2:50 to the time Detective Vannatter arrived to 4:05 --

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: If you know.

THE WITNESS: Standing in the street with me.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, when Detective Vannatter arrived, what
occurred?

A. I introduced myself to him. I'd never met him before. Explained to
him who I was, that I was the coordinator for West L.A. homicide and
that I would take him on a walk-through of the crime scene.

Q. Did you do that?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And approximately how long did the walk-through take?

A. Approximately 10 minutes.

Q. And after the walk-through, what occurred next?

A. We walked -- I walked with Detective Vannatter back to Bundy and
Dorothy and was at the police cars in the intersection awaiting his
partner.

Q. Did there came come a time his partner arrived?

A. Yes. Detective Tom Lange arrived at the same location at 4:25 in
the morning.

Q. And what occurred when Detective Lange arrived?

A. Detective Vannatter, Detective Lange had a short conversation. Then
Detective Vannatter introduced Detective Lange to me and told him that
I would take him through a walk-through, which I did.

Q. And on the walk-through of both Detective Vannatter and Lange, did
you point out particular evidence that you observed?

A. Yes.

Q. Now after the walk-through with Detective Lange, did there come a
time when you told either detective anything about your instructions
from Commander Bushey?

A. I had first mentioned to Detective Vannatter when we were waiting
for Detective Lange that I'd been instructed to do that.

Q. That you had been instructed to do that?

A. To make a personal notification to Mr. Simpson.

Q. Now, did the fact that Mr. -- You had worked west L.A. for a number
of years?

A. Since 1989.

Q. Did the fact Mr. Simpson was a celebrity, in your opinion, have
anything to do with your going over to give him a personal
notification?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Irrelevant. Lack of foundation. Calls for
speculation. Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled. State of mind of this witness.

THE WITNESS: Commander Bushey had instructed me to do that because of
Mr. Simpson's stature in the neighborhood and the community. He was a
well-known individual and he felt it would be insensitive for him to
find out about this incident from the newspaper or by having someone
call his house. So he wanted me to make the notification to him in
person.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I move to strike that "Mr. Bushey said."

THE COURT: It's stricken as nonresponsive.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Strike what Commander Bushey felt.

In your opinion of having worked West L.A. division, was the personal
notification to be given to Mr. Simpson different than others who
might not have a celebrity status would ordinarily receive?

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: In the form that it is stated, I don't see -- I don't
understand that question at all. What's his experience in west L.A.
got to do with that?

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, if he's going -- I ask that we approach the
side bar if he's going to.

MR. MEDVENE: If we might.

THE COURT: Why don't you just ask whether or not this was unusual.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Was it unusual?

(Laughter.)

A. It was not unusual and that I made a notification. It was unusual
that I had been directed to do so by a commanding officer of a
commander rank to do that. I'd never had a commander tell me to do
this before.

Q. And did that, in your judgment, from your understanding of how west
L.A. Department works, have anything to do with Mr. Simpson's status.

MR. LEONARD: Objection, Your Honor. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Was it unusual?

MR. LEONARD: Objection.

THE COURT: He just stated why it's unusual. I sustain my own
objection.

MR. LEONARD: I had one too.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) When was a determination made to go to Rockingham?

A. Shortly before 5:00 in the morning.

Q. And were you present when that determination was made?

A. Yes. The four of us, Vannatter, Lange Fuhrman and I were all
standing in the middle of Bundy avenue in front of the crime scene.
And to -- and Phil Vannatter, Lange were talking and I said --

MR. LEONARD: Objection, Your Honor. Nonresponsive. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Answer's stricken.

MR. MEDVENE: Can you tell us what you said?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: What was your understanding of the purpose you were going
to Rockingham.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled. You asked me to strike it, I struck his answer.
So that part no longer is in evidence.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, if I may be heard.

THE COURT: What?

MR. LEONARD: You ruled it was irrelevant. I thought that was the basis
of the prior objection.

THE COURT: I don't want to conduct your examination, counsel but you
know, let's get on with it and ask the question you want to ask. What
is it you want to ask him?

MR. MEDVENE: I asked him -- yes, I want to ask him, Your Honor, if you
want to deal with it.

THE COURT: What is it you want to ask him?

MR. MEDVENE: I want to ask him, Your Honor, what was his understanding
of why he was going to Rockingham.

THE COURT: What difference does it make what his understanding was.
Why don't you ask him why they went to Rockingham. Why did you go to
Rockingham?

THE WITNESS: Went to Rockingham to notify Mr. Simpson about the death
of his ex-wife.

MR. MEDVENE: How long did you expect to be at Rockingham when --
Strike that.

At the time you left Bundy, what functions did you intend to perform
at Rockingham?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: Did you intend to assist Mr. Simpson in retrieving his
children from west L.A police department?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered and leading.

THE COURT: Sustain as leading.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) When you went -- Strike that.

Can you tell us what, if anything, your going to Rockingham had to do
with assisting in Simpson in getting his children from West L.A.
police station?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I'll sustain it.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) When you went to Rockingham, did you go for any
purpose other than to notify Mr. Simpson of the death of his former
wife?

A. Yes.

Q. What was that purpose?

A. Mr. Simpson's children were at West Los Angeles station. I was
going to inform him of the death and see if I couldn't be of any
assistance to him in taking him back to west L.A. station to pick up
his children and take him back to Rockingham and to do whatever I
could do to not let him go by the Bundy location.

Q. And who was going to do that?

A. Detective Fuhrman and myself.

Q. And while you were doing that, what was your understanding of what
Detectives Lange and -- Lange and Vannatter going to do?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Form that it's asked, sustained..

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Approximately what time did you -- strike that.

Who was left in charge of the Bundy crime scene at the time you and
Detective Fuhrman and Detectives Lange and Vannatter left Bundy for
Rockingham?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Lieutenants John Rodgers who is a Lieutenant in charge of
robbery/homicide who is Vannatter and Lange's supervisor.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And how long, if you know, was it anticipated that
Detectives Lange and Vannatter would be at Rockingham before returning
to Bundy?

MR. LEONARD: Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. They figured that they would return to Bundy in ten or 15 minutes.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) What was your understanding of what they were
going to do at Bundy?

A. When they returned, sir?

Q. No, excuse me. What was your understanding of what they were going
to do at Rockingham?

A. They wanted to talk to Mr. Simpson. They said they wanted to talk
to Mr. Simpson, introduce themselves to him and them a little bit
about maybe what Nicole had done the night before or anything about
her activities before they started their investigation.

Q. Approximately what time did you arrive at Rockingham?

A. About 5:05.

Q. Did you make, did you or the other detectives make any attempt from
outside the Rockingham location to reach Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. What attempts were made?

A. I rang the gate buzzer on the Ashford side of the property. I rang
it several times. I think it's Ashton. And some of the other
detectives also rang that buzzer and we received no answer.

Q. Did you make any attempt to obtain the phone number of the
residence?

A. Yes. I noticed a Westec patrol sign on the property so I called the
watch commander at West L.A. station and had them contact Westec and
see if they couldn't find out information about whether or not --
whether or not the people were out of town. Where somebody was on the
property. Basically if we had another emergency phone number. If
someone was not there, we could call somebody else.

Q. Did there come a time when you obtained the number for the Simpson
residence?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you make a phone call?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Detective Phillips placed on the board what's been marked 115. And
I ask you what that is.

(The instrument herein described as copy of phone records of Ron
Phillips was marked For identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
115.)

THE WITNESS: May I get up an approach it, Your Honor?

THE COURT: You may.

THE WITNESS: Its evening that this was taken place. I was using my own
personal cell phone and this it is my phone bill for those two days,
June 12 and June 13. My own personal phone bill.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And does that phone bill indicate what time you
made the phone call to Mr. Simpson's residence from outside his
residence on June 13?

A. Yes, it does. It's 5:36 in the morning.

Q. Now, what was your understanding as of that time. Oh, strike that.
I'm sorry. When you made that phone call, did you receive any
response?

A. No. I did. Well, there was an answering machine with a prerecorded
message from Mr. `O.J. Simpson asking us to leave a message.

Q. As of that time, what was your understanding whether or not anyone
was to be in the home at this time, 5:30 in the morning.

A. Westec had no knowledge that anybody had been or had left that
residence for any long period of time. There was no notification of
any vacation schedules or anything like that.

Another Westec officer informed us that the property, Mr. Simpson
estate, lived a 24-hour maid that should be on the property.

Q. As far as you knew, there were two people in the house?

MR. BAKER: Objection.

THE WITNESS: I didn't know if anyone was in the house.

Q. (BY MS. MEDVENE) Now, at that point in time, did you have any
concern for the safety of who ever maid in -- be in the house?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Was it -- was a decision made to go into the
house?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. And what was the purpose of doing that?

A. It was a decision made by Vannatter and Lange to go over the wall
and to try to raise somebody on the premise inside -- Or inside the
gate.

Q. And why was that?

A. They were concerned that someone's safety, about something
happening at that residence because of other things we had found
outside that location.

Q. Detective Phillips, we've put on the board what's been marked 116.
And if you would be kind, could you go over to it and illustrate for
the jury, when you came in the fence, where you went?

(The instrument herein described as diagram of Rockingham property was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 116.)

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, may I move over here? Thank you.

THE WITNESS: When I drove up -- drove on up on Rockingham avenue, made
a right turn over to Ashford. Then I parked my vehicle right around
this area here. Detective Lange and Vannatter parked their vehicle
behind mine.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) One second. When you say around this area here, a
few inches on that chart, left of where it says, "Ashford street or
the pathway?"

A. No. This is the driveway that goes into the residence. We were west
of this driveway parked on the curb.

Q. All right, sir. Go ahead.

A. This is the intercom that I approached and pushed the button on and
received no answer. And then some of the other detectives also pushed
that button and received no answer.

Q. Then?

A. Well, then I stood out in the street making my phone call to
Sergeant Rossi. And in a short time later, a Westec unit traveling
southbound on Rockingham approached this intersection and I walked up
to him and he identified himself and asked him if he was the unit that
had responded to our call. He informed me that he was not.

Q. Okay. What happened next?

A. I then obtained the phone number from the house from the Westec
officer here. Went back over here to the street, made the phone call
to the house. I could hear the phone ringing inside the house and then
the answering machine picked up.

Q. What occurred then?

A. A Westec Sergeant then arrived northbound on Rockingham and parked
in this area here. Detective Fuhrman, and I think Vannatter at
different times, talked to that Westec officer. I did not.

Q. What occurred then?

A. We then stood in this area here. I was on my cell phone. And
Detective Vannatter and Detective Lange informed me that they had made
the decision that they were going to go over the fence and onto the
property.

I said "Fine."

And at this point, right here is where Mark Fuhrman jumped the fence,
came back over here, and released some type of a pin mechanism on the
hydraulic gate and opened it up and allowed the other three of us to
go inside.

Q. What did you then do to attempt to obtain entrance to the house?

A. I walked up to the front entrance of the house, which was right
here, rang the doorbell.

Nobody answered.

I believe another officer may have rang the doorbell, and nobody
answered.

I then walked back out onto the driveway, along with the other three
detectives. And we walked around this walkway which leads back around
the back of the house into the pool area, and walked up to a
French-door area, right here at the back of the residence.

And I believe it was Detective Phil Vannatter that knocked on these
doors, trying to arouse someone.

Q. Were you able to find someone that let you into the house, to try
to see if there was someone there?

A. Eventually, we did.

Q. And when you say "eventually" you did, who assisted you in gaining
entrance to the house to see if Mr. Simpson was there?

A. Arnelle Simpson, Mr. Simpson's daughter, who was living in this
bungalow right back here, we woke her up, and she allowed entrance to
the house, allowed us to go into the house.

Q. Now, prior to her allowing you to go into the house, had anyone
knocked on a door that turned out to be Mr. Kato Kaelin's room?

A. Yes. I knocked on the door at Kato Kaelin's room here first,
received no answer. There was a Venetian blind on the door that him
went three-quarters of the way down, so I bent down and peeked in, and
I saw an arm laying on what was a bed or a couch or something. And I
got up and told the other detectives, "There's somebody in there. All
I can see is an arm."

And immediately after that, the door was opened up by Mr. Kaelin.

Q. And did you then proceed with Detectives Lange and Vannatter to
what turned out to be Ms. Simpson's room and to the house when she
opened the door?

A. Yes. She told us where Ms. Arnelle Simpson was, and then she took
us back to the house.

Q. Did someone remain with Mr. Kaelin?

A. I believe Detective Fuhrman did.

Q. Now, when Ms. Simpson went into the main house to try to find Mr.
Simpson, did you check to see if the maid was safe, or the housekeeper
was safe?

A. She took us to the maid's quarters, which was just off the kitchen.

Q. And what did you observe there?

A. There was no one in that room; the bed was completely made, and the
room was all fixed up. Apparently, nobody was in that room.

Q. Was any call made in an attempt to find where Mr. Simpson might be?

A. Yes.

Q. And who was called, if you know?

A. Arnelle Simpson called Cathy Randa, who was Mr. Simpson's
secretary.

Q. As a result of that call, did you find out where Mr. Simpson was?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And where was he?

A. He was in Chicago.

Q. Did you then attempt to get in contact with Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. I've put up 117.

And I ask if you reached Mr. Simpson in Chicago?

(The instrument herein described as phone record of Ron Phillips call
to Chicago was marked For identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
117.)

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And approximately what time was that?

A. 6:05 in the morning.

Q. What is 117, if you know?

A. I believe that's the phone bill of the Simpson residence.

Q. Now, when you reached him in Chicago, what did you initially say?

A. I called the desk, asked for Mr. O.J. Simpson's room.

They rang a number, and a male answered the phone. And I asked him if
he was O.J. Simpson. And he said yes.

And I told him I was Detective Phillips from the Los Angeles Police
Department, and that I had some bad news.

Q. What did you then say?

A. I told him that his ex-wife, Nicole, had been killed.

And he immediately said, "Oh, my God! Nicole is killed!" He said, "Oh,
my God! Nicole is dead!" He kept repeating himself. And he became very
upset.

Q. Did he ask you if you were sure it was his wife?

A. No, he didn't.

Q. Did he ask you how you knew it was Nicole?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did he ask you how she died?

A. No.

Q. Did he ask if it was a traffic accident?

A. No.

Q. Did he ask if she'd fallen?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did he ask any questions about how she died?

A. No, he didn't.

Q. Did he ask any questions about where she died?

A. No, he didn't.

Q. Did he ask any questions about the circumstances of her death?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) How many death notifications have you given,
Detective Fuhrman, over its last 30 years?

A. I'm Detective Phillips.

Q. I'm sorry.

How many death notifications have you given, Detective Phillips, over
the last 30 years?

A. Several hundred.

Q. In your experience, do people who receive such a notification
ordinarily ask how their loved one died?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, Your Honor. Leading, lack of foundation,
irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: There's initial shock when I tell them. Then they always
want to ask questions about how, why, when, where, am I sure, how do I
know.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Were any of those questions asked by Mr. Simpson?

A. No.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, after the conversation with -- strike that.

Do you recall anything else Mr. Simpson said in the phone call?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell us?

A. Well, I tried to get him to calm down and listen to me.

He eventually calmed down, and I told him that we had his children at
West Los Angeles Police Station.

And he immediately said, "What do you have my children at the police
station for?"

I told him we had no place to take them; they were in our custody.

And he said, "I'm taking the first flight out of Chicago. I'm coming
back to LA. Is my daughter still there, Arnelle?" I said "Yes."

He said, "I want to talk to her."

So I handed the phone to Arnelle.

Q. Now, did you have any further conversation with Mr. Simpson at that
time?

A. No, sir.

Q. Now, shortly thereafter, did you have occasion to see Mark Fuhrman?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell us the circumstances?

A. After I got off the phone with Mr. Simpson, Tom Lange talked to
Arnelle Simpson, and I walked into a breakfast nook area of
Rockingham, where the doors were open. It's a doorway that I had seen
Mark Fuhrman walk out of. And then I was standing around those doors,
and he came back to me, walked back into my sight.

Q. And what did he say to you, if anything?

A. He said that he wanted to show me something, that he had found
something, and would I go with him.

Q. And did you?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Placed on the board is what's been marked 145. And I ask you if
you'd mind approaching the board, and with the use of the board and
the pictures on it, describe for the ladies and gentlemen of the jury
and the Court where you and Detective Fuhrman went.

(The instrument herein described as diagram of four photos
collectively were marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
145.)

A. These are the doors I'm referring to. The kitchen is right in this
area, and then is like -- I call it a breakfast nook area. I don't
know what it really is.

These are the doors that Mark Fuhrman had walked out of and walked
back into and I was standing at.

Q. Okay. And where did you walk?

A. I followed Mark out into the driveway around the garage and walked
down this pathway, all the way back to where there was an air
conditioner, which is depicted in this picture here.

Q. When you say "this picture here," that's the picture furthest to
the left, looking out at that Exhibit 147.

Would you describe that for us?

(The instrument herein described side view of Rockingham property was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 147.)

A. This is the picture of the walkway to the south of the Simpson
residence.

Q. We're also -- for everyone, he's putting the picture up on the TV
monitor.

Which one did you want me to use?

Maybe the TV monitor would be easier.

A. Yes.

And he walked me back to this air conditioner that sticks out of the
wall, and stopped right in this area, and pointed to what appeared to
me to be some type have a brown glove.

Q. Would you go to 148, which is the second picture on the chart.

And again, that's up on the monitor, if that's helpful for you.

(The instrument herein described as walkway and sideview of Rockingham
property was marked For identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
148.)

A. This is the object that he had pointed out to me.

Q. You say this is the object. Could you just describe where you're
pointing?

A. This right here is the -- which is in this picture, also. It's a
glove that was lying on the sidewalk in the area of the air
conditioner.

Q. At a later time, do you have any knowledge of whether or not an
evidence card was put out by the glove, or put near the glove?

A. I was not there when that was done.

Q. All right.

After you had observed the glove and Mr. Fuhrman pointed it out, how
close did you get to it?

A. I think I got within maybe three or four feet of it, at the most.

Q. What did you do and what did Detective Fuhrman do?

A. After looking at it, I told him, I said, "Let's go back to the
house and let Vannatter and Lange know about this."

Which we did; we returned back to the house.

Q. And do you know if Detective Fuhrman showed Detective Lange and or
Vannatter what he had previously shown you?

A. He showed them both.

Q. Now, after each of you was shown the glove in the area where the
glove was found, what occurred?

A. There was a short conversation between Vannatter and Lange and
Fuhrman, and they directed -- Vannatter and Lange directed Mark and I
to go back to the Bundy location, to take a look at the other glove at
the Bundy location, to see if it was a match, because we had a
right-hand glove at this location, and we wanted to see if we had a
right or left-hand glove at the other location.

Q. Did you and Detective Fuhrman leave Rockingham for Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. At approximately what time did you leave Rockingham?

A. Possibly about 6:25, because I arrived back at Bundy at 6:30.

Q. And could you tell us what happened when you arrived back at Bundy?

A. We exited our car. I walked up to Lieutenant Spangler with my
supervisor and Lieutenant Rodgers from robbery/homicide, to tell them
what happened at Rockingham.

Mark said he was going to go over and take a look at the other glove.

And I said, "Take a photographer with you, and make sure you
photograph it."

And, at which time he went over and got Mr. Rokahr, the photographer,
and they walked back up to the original crime scene, where Nicole and
Ron Goldman were at.

MR. MEDVENE: I'll place on the board which has been marked Exhibit 40.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I ask if you know what that is.

A. That's a photograph of Mark Fuhrman's hand pointing to the glove
that was at the Bundy location.

Q. And when was that taken?

A. It was taken shortly after we arrived back at Bundy.

Possibly 6:35, somewhere in that area?

Q. I've placed on the board, please.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, you're referring to the board constantly, and
you have a board up there. And you're also referring to the
television. The record is not going to be very clear.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) We were just looking at Exhibit 40 on the TV
monitor.

Would you please put up Exhibit 92 on the TV monitor.

Tell us what's depicted in Exhibit 92.

A. This gentleman here is Detective Mark Fuhrman. He's pointing to the
glove that was found at the Bundy location in that area.

Q. Is that the same overview of the same photo?

A. Yes, it appears to be.

Q. Now, what did Detective Fuhrman then do, to your knowledge?

A. Detective Fuhrman walked back to me and told me that he thought it
was a match, that it was the same type of glove, it appeared to be the
same, and it was a left glove, and that he was going to take the
photographer and go back to Rockingham.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Move to strike as nonresponsive. He asked what
Fuhrman did. Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did Detective Fuhrman, shortly thereafter, to your
knowledge, leave Bundy?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. And where was he going, to your knowledge?

A. He informed me he was going to Rockingham.

Q. Now, how do you remember that the picture was taken at the
approximate time that you said it was?

A. Because that's the time we returned from Rockingham. We returned
back to Rockingham about 6:30 in the morning. And within a minute of
that time, Mark got a photographer headed back up to have the
photograph taken.

Q. Did you have your cell phone with you, or had you lent it to
anyone?

A. I had my personal cell phone all day.

Q. Had you LENT your cell phone to anyone at the Bundy scene?

A. I may have let someone use it to make a phone call if an officer
was going to be late or something like that, wanted to call home,
or... I never lent it to someone to take and keep, only to use.

Q. About how long after the photo being taken did you leave Bundy?

A. Did I leave Bundy? I didn't leave Bundy.

Q. You stayed at Bundy for how long?

A. I possibly stayed at Bundy until well after 10 o'clock, 10:30.

Q. Okay. I just have one last area.

I place before you, 126.

Unfortunately, it won't work too well on the TV screen.

Could you describe what Exhibit 126 is?

(The instrument herein described as ten page document showing
officers' shoes taken by Ron Phillips was marked For identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 126.)

A. Yes. Detective Vannatter and Detective Lange had called me up at
West Los Angeles Station, I believe, the day after, on June 14, and
asked that I get in contact with every police officer that was at the
crime scene at Bundy and have them come and see me and in the homicide
unit and bring the shoes that they had worn at the homicide scene.

And I was to take photographs of the soles and heels of each officer's
shoes, which I did. And each picture has the officer's name that goes
along with those shoes.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I move to strike as irrelevant. I didn't get
a chance to see that particular exhibit just now. And I think, based
on the Court's prior order, that is irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. MEDVENE: Exhibits 115, 116, 117, 145, 147, and 148, I believe, are
stipulated to both foundation and admissibility. And we would move in
126.

THE COURT: What's 126.

MR. MEDVENE: 126 are the photographs the witness just testified about,
Your Honor, of the SHOES that various officers were wearing at the
scene.

MR. BAKER: Objection. Foundation, Your Honor.

MR. LEONARD: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained as to foundation.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Who took those photos?

A. I did.

Q. And there's -- could you describe Exhibit 1, what's on the exhibit?

A. Well, that's an officer's name on each Polaroid photograph. And
there's the bottom of a shoe, showing the heel and the sole of the
shoe.

And they were all taken on the table -- this is a table in the
interview room at West L.A. station. Each officer turned around and
put his foot up on the table, and I took a Polaroid photograph of the
left and the right shoe.

Q. We can go through them one at a time, but to save time, do the
pictures --

THE COURT: You don't want further foundation?

MR. LEONARD: No, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. MEDVENE: We move in 126.

THE COURT: Received.

(The series of photographs previously marked Plaintiffs' Exhibit 126
was received in evidence.)

MR. MEDVENE: Nothing further. Thank you very much.

THE COURT: Ten-minute recess.

Ladies and gentlemen, don't talk about the case; don't form or express
an opinion.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, we agreed that sunrise was at 5:42 in the
morning on the 13th.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BAKER: Stipulated between all parties.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

MR. LEONARD: May I examine, Your Honor?

THE COURT: You may.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Good afternoon. My name is Dan Leonard; I represent O.J. Simpson.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. Detective Phillips, was it your intention when you took the stand
today, to make sure that your testimony before this jury was as
accurate and truthful as possible?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And what steps, if any, did you take in order to accomplish that
goal, sir?

A. I reviewed my transcript of the trial. I had one or two meetings
with the plaintiffs' attorneys in preparation for my testimony here.

That's basically all I've done.

Q. You had a meeting last night over at the Doubletree Hotel with the
plaintiffs' attorneys; is that correct?

A. No.

Q. Did you have a meeting at any time recently at the Doubletree Hotel
with the plaintiffs' attorneys?

A. Other than meeting them there this morning, that's the first time
I've ever been there.

Q. I'm sorry; I misspoke.

When you met them this morning, Officer Thompson was also there; is
that right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you went over with the plaintiffs' attorneys, the questions you
would be asked and the answers you would give?

A. This morning?

Q. Yeah.

A. Not really.

Q. What did you do this morning?

A. I looked at a photograph.

Q. Okay. Which photograph was that, sir?

A. It was a photograph of the north -- the east-west walkway on the
north side of the property.

Q. Were you there when the plaintiffs' attorneys were showing Officer
Thompson some photographs?

A. No.

Q. You weren't present at all?

A. I didn't see anything that they were showing him.

Q. Were you present when they were interviewing or discussing anything
about this case with Officer Thompson?

A. No; I believe they left. I was eating breakfast in the restaurant,
and Thompson and one of the attorneys left.

Q. So, you weren't present for those discussions?

A. No, sir.

Q. What else did you do?

You said you reviewed your transcript from the criminal trial, right?

A. Yes.

Q. You met with the plaintiffs' attorneys on what, two occasions,
including this morning?

A. Two or three occasions.

Q. Did you meet with any investigators for the plaintiffs at any time?

A. There's an investigator named Otis Marlow that has come by the
station. He basically just set up times when I was to meet with Mr.
Medvene, to see what my schedule and their schedule was, and when that
would be.

Q. And Otis Marlow is a former LAPD officer, correct?

A. Yes, he is.

Q. And he had some involvement in the Simpson case, did he not?

A. I don't know what involvement he had in the case.

Q. So if he did, you don't know, right?

I'll withdraw the question.

A. He -- okay. You withdraw it, so I'm going to withdraw my answer.

Q. Excuse me?

A. You withdrew the question, So I'm not going to answer it.

Q. Fine.

A. Okay.

Q. Did you at any time meet with a fellow named Tippin, an
investigator for the plaintiffs?

A. I don't recall the name.

Q. Tippin was an LAPD officer who worked in this investigation.

A. Tippin. I thought you said Tippet.

Q. Tippin.

A. Tippin.

I don't recall meeting him. I may have talked to him on the phone.

Q. When you talked to him, it was after Mr. Simpson's acquittal,
correct?

A. I believe so.

Q. He represented to you that he was an investigator for the
plaintiffs in this case, correct?

A. That's why I would have talked to him.

Q. And he had some role in the investigation, correct, of Mr. Simpson
during the criminal case, right?

A. I have no idea what role he had. He works out of downtown, sir. I
don't know who worked on this case out of downtown.

Q. When is it that you last reviewed your transcript from the criminal
trial?

A. Possibly looked at some of it last night.

Q. Okay. And in particular, did you look at the section that dealt
with the discussion that you had with Mr. Simpson when he was in
Chicago, the telephone discussion?

A. I looked at that in the transcript, and I also viewed that in the
document that I had prepared.

Q. Okay. When you're referring to a document you prepared, you're
referring to the report that you made of that?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. By the way, that's the only report that you made involving your
activities of June 13, 1994; isn't that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. You didn't make any report about any observations of blood or
anything else you made at either the Bundy or Rockingham crime scene;
isn't that correct, sir?

A. That's correct.

Q. So when you were testifying today about observations you made, that
was from memory, wasn't it?

A. That's correct.

Q. Prior to the criminal trial, sir, did you make sure that you
reviewed any relevant materials, including your reports an reports of
other officers, in order that your testimony would be accurate and
truthful, sir? Did you do that?

A. To the best of my knowledge, I did.

Q. That's something that you would do in a double-homicide case, isn't
it?

A. Something I'd do in any homicide. I like to prepare myself before I
take the witness stand.

Q. Well, the case was special, wasn't it, sir?

A. Only to the news media.

Q. Well, it was on national television, wasn't it?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: I'm going to allow you sufficient leeway, but don't overdo
it, please.

MR. LEONARD: I hear you, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) When you had your meeting with the plaintiffs'
attorneys this morning, did you go over the part of your testimony
that dealt with the discussion you had with Mr. Simpson when he was
this Chicago?

Did you go over that in particular?

A. No. My discussion this morning was over breakfast. And I looked at
one photograph, and then Mr. Thompson and Mr. Medvene left, and I
continued to eat my French toast.

Q. So your testimony is that the only thing you discussed was one
photograph; is that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And nothing else?

A. Not this morning.

Q. Now, on prior occasions when you have met with plaintiffs'
attorneys, did you talk about your discussion with Mr. Simpson in
Chicago, a telephone discussion, is that something that you did with
them?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And have you always told them the same version that you told
the jury today about that telephone discussion?

A. I'd like to think I've told it the same way every time, except for
a few words that may get changed here and there. But the basic meat of
it, I think, is the same.

Q. Well, can you think of any words right now that you didn't tell
this jury that you've testified to before about this conversation?

A. No.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Compound. He's asking him to recall --

THE COURT: The answer can be yes or no.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Can you think of any?

A. Would you repeat the question.

Q. Yes.

Can you think of any words that Mr. Simpson spoke to you or you spoke
to Mr. Simpson during that telephone conversation that you didn't tell
this jury about this morning --

A. No.

Q. -- or this afternoon?

A. I can't think of any offhand.

Q. You have made public appearances with the Goldman family; is that
right?

A. I don't believe so.

Q. Have you ever appeared, or have you ever attended any kind of
rallies or anything like that or any kind of publication in support of
the Ron Goldman Foundation?

A. No, I have not.

Q. You've had discussions with Mr. Goldman since the acquittal; is
that right?

A. Other than to say hi to him and how are you doing, and hope your
family is doing fine, and he asks me the same. And that's basically
been our conversations.

Q. Do you feel like your testimony has been not colored at all by any
feelings that you have about the result of the criminal case?

A. Today?

Q. Yeah.

A. Sir, I got up here and testified to what I believe I remembered,
exactly like I did in the criminal case. No different.

Q. And again, you had the benefit of reviewing your transcript this
morning; is that correct?

A. I didn't review my transcript this morning. I may have looked at a
page or two.

Q. Well when?

A. Most of it was done last night.

Q. Okay. You feel like you did an author's review?

A. I didn't read it all, no. There was too much of it.

Q. Didn't bother to read it all?

A. Well, I tried to read it all, but I have other cases to do, also.

Q. Now, Mr. Medvene had asked you a number of questions about your
discussion with Mr. Simpson.

Your telephone discussion on the 13th, for instance, he asked you if
Mr. Simpson asked any questions about how Nicole Brown Simpson was
killed. Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. And -- well, isn't it true that Mr. Simpson asked you repeatedly,
"What do you mean, Nicole's been killed?"

Do you are remember that?

A. He wasn't asking me -- he was talking on the telephone, going, "Oh,
my God. Nicole is dead. Oh, my God. Nicole is dead."

Q. Well, who else was on the telephone?

A. He wasn't talking to me; he was talking to himself. I was
listening.

Q. Did he or did he not say to you repeatedly, "What do you mean,
Nicole has been killed?"

Didn't he say that to you?

A. He asked me that one time, yes.

Q. Didn't he say it repeatedly?

A. No.

Q. Do you remember testifying at the criminal trial with regard to
this very same discussion at page 15221 -- starting at 15220. And it
was your answer to the question:

"Q. So you never responded to Mr. O.J. Simpson's request, 'What do you
mean she's been killed?'

And it is your statement that he was upset at this point; was he not?

"A. Yes, he was."

Do you remember giving that answer to that question?

A. Okay.

Q. Do you?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Next:

"Q. And you expected -- and then he went to say, 'Oh, my God, Nicole
is dead. Oh, my God.' And he continued repeating himself in and upset
fashion; isn't that correct?

"A. Yes, he did.

Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

"Q. At some point, didn't you try to get him to get hold of himself
from an emotional standpoint?

"A. Yes, I did.

"Q. And he kept repeating himself, 'she's been killed? What do you
mean she's been killed? Oh, my God, Nicole is dead,' and repeated
himself over and over again.

"A. That's correct.

Did you give those responses to those questions at the criminal trial,
sir?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. So, in fact, Mr. Simpson did say to you over and over again,
"What do you mean, she's been killed?" Isn't that right, sir?

A. He said that, yes.

Q. And is there any reason in particular why you didn't tell that to
this jury this afternoon?

A. Well, he said that, and then he said, "Oh, my God, Nicole's been
killed; Oh, my God, Nicole is dead" over and over again.

Q. My question, sir, is: Is there any reason in particular you failed
to tell this jury that Mr. Simpson asked you the question, "What do
you mean, she's been killed?"

A. I answered the questions to the best of my recollection today.

Q. Oh.

Well, did you read that part of the transcript when you were reviewing
it?

A. I answered the questions to the best of my recollection today. If I
answered it differently back then, that's the answer I gave back then.
That's the answer I gave today.

Q. All right. But you would agree that your recollection back then was
better than it is today --

A. Yes, it is.

Q. -- wouldn't you?

And you also prepared a report about this discussion, didn't you?

A. Yes, I did.

MR. LEONARD: May I approach?

THE COURT: (Nods affirmatively.)

MR. LEONARD: Thank you. This is Exhibit -- the next number.

MR. PETROCELLI: What number is that?

MR. LEONARD: What number?

MR. BAKER: Should be 2106, I believe.

MR. P. BAKER: Yes.

(The document herein described as A statement made by Detective
Phillips pertaining to the telephone conversation he had with O.J.
Simpson in Chicago on the morning of June 13, 1994, advising Mr.
Simpson of Nicole Brown Simpson's murder, marked Plaintiffs' Exhibit
2106 for identification.)

THE COURT: Jurors, hello.

You don't compare notes. If you've got questions, you ask the Court.
You're not to talk about this case. Those notebooks and pencils we've
given you are for you to take notes. What transpires in this trial is
recorded by the reporter. If there's any discrepancy between what was
wrote down and what you recall, you ask the Court, and the Court will
have the reporter read it back to you.

You're not to discuss what you're writing down on your notes. Okay.
Three of you jurors were conferring amongst yourselves about what
you've been writing. Don't do that. Those notes are only your own
personal notes, not your fellow jurors' notes

Everybody understand that?

JURORS: Yes, sir.

THE COURT: All right.

MR. LEONARD: May I, Your Honor?

THE COURT: You may.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) I show you what's been marked as 2106.

And take your time and look at it; tell me what it is.

A. It's a statement I made about the conversation of Mr. Simpson on
the telephone.

Q. That's a written report that was made when, sir?

A. Typed report.

Q. Excuse me. Typed report?

A. 6/13/94.

Q. It was made the same day, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. You certainly would agree that your memory, as memorialized in that
document, is much better than it is today, wouldn't you, sir?

A. Much better.

Q. Much better?

A. Much better.

Q. Now, I want you to read, if you will -- I think it's seven --
actually read one, two, three, four, five, six, seven -- why don't you
read it starting with the, "I obtained the O'Hare Plaza Hotel," that
paragraph. I want you to read that out loud to the jury.

A. Just that paragraph?

Q. No, down to the bottom of the page.

A. I obtained the O'Hare Plaza Hotel phone number from information and
called the hotel.

I asked for the room of Mr.` O.J. Simpson. I was connected, and a male
voice answered. I asked the person if he was O.J. Simpson, and the
voice responded yes.

I advised Mr. Simpson that I was Detective Ron Phillips of the Los
Angeles Police Department, and that I had to relay some bad
information to him. I advised Mr. Simpson that his ex-wife, Nicole,
had been killed.

Mr. Simpson replied, "What do you mean, she has been killed? Oh, my
God, Nicole is dead. Oh, my God."

Q. Thank you, sir.

A. I tried --

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me.

THE WITNESS: You said to the bottom of the page.

MR. LEONARD: Go ahead.

MR. MEDVENE: It continues in context on the next page. We ask that
that be read.

THE COURT: Well, you can have -- on your redirect, you can have him
read the whole thing, if you like, okay?

MR. LEONARD: I'm satisfied.

THE COURT: If you want him to just read a part, fine.

THE WITNESS: You don't want me to read to the bottom, sir?

MR. LEONARD: No.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, how long have you known Mark Fuhrman?

A. I believe Mark Fuhrman came to work the robbery table in 1991 or
1990. I don't recall for sure what year he came to the robbery table
where I was working.

Q. And when he arrived, when he came to the -- what does "table" mean?
What do you mean by that?

A. In the detective division, it's a an old phrase because we used to
all have tables instead of desks -- now we've gotten modern -- and two
detectives sat at each table, and the tables butted against each
other. It's a term that came up, that we work a table -- that is a
robbery unit, a homicide unit and a burglary unit and an auto unit, so
forth -- we work the robbery unit, that desk.

And Mark Fuhrman came to work with for the robbery unit.

Q. When he came to work, you were his supervisor?

A. No, I was not.

Q. You were his supervisor starting when? Let's put it like that.

A. When Mark Fuhrman came to the robbery unit, Bob Tapia was his
supervisor. Then I was promoted to Detective II, and I out-ranked him
-- I always out-ranked him -- but we didn't work together; we worked
the same table.

And then when he was sent to the homicide unit, I became a D-3. I
became his immediate supervisor.

Q. And in -- in relation to June 12, 1994, when is it that you became
Mark Fuhrman's immediate supervisor? In other words, was it a year
before, two years before?

A. Well, again, I was his supervisor, a D-2 when he was a D-1 in
robbery. But I was not his supervisor, like I was as a D-3; Bob Tapia
was.

There's 3 ranks of Detective: Detective 1, 2, and 3. The D-3 is the
overall detective supervisor; a D-2 is in the middle, and he out-ranks
the D-1, and basically can tell them what to do and approve his
reports, but I was not his ultimate supervisor.

When I went to work in the homicide unit, I believe in March --
February or March of '94 and Mark Fuhrman was working the homicide
unit, I went there as a D-3 and I became his immediate supervisor, his
ultimate supervisor.

Q. So for about three or four months prior to June 12, 1994, you were
his immediate supervisor?

A. That's true.

Q. And you had to approve his work?

A. That's true.

Q. You had to approve his reports --

A. Yes.

Q. -- correct? You had to direct him as necessary, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you had to supervise and train him, if necessary?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, this line.

THE COURT: Approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

THE COURT: Where are you going?

MR. LEONARD: I'm almost done. I have maybe one more question.

THE COURT: The objection was relevance. What is the relevance?

MR. LEONARD: I thought your earlier ruling was that we could bring up
Fuhrman's background, or at least talk about the fact that he had a
motive and opportunity to plant. I thought that was one of your prior
rulings.

THE COURT: This is establishing that?

MR. LEONARD: Well, it's foundation. It also establishes as foundation
that this witness may be biased, because he has an interest in making
sure that somebody was working under his control at that time, is not
perceived to be somebody who was involved in planting, or his motive
is a bias to maybe not tell the truth about it. I mean, this guy was
working under his watch.

Look, I'll move on. I made my point.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, you testified on direct -- direct examination
that at approximately 1 o'clock or so, you received a call from
Sergeant Rossi, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And thereafter, you made calls to Detective Fuhrman, Detective
Roberts, and Detective Noland; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you said that you related -- I thought you said that you
related basically the same thing; you related that Sergeant Rossi told
you about the situation to each of those detectives; is that right?

A. That we've got a double homicide, yes.

Q. Okay. You also said in direct, in your direct testimony, that when
you spoke to -- was it Gartland? Did you call him, as well, right
about that time?

A. No, sir. I called him at 2:39 in the morning.

Q. Okay. Who else did you call at the same time that you called these
detectives, if anyone?

A. I did. On the way to -- may I explain?

Q. Sure.

A. Okay. We have trainees that want to experience homicide scenes, so
we have a list that are not actually on call, but they want to come
out if they can, if they're available. So I called three different
people besides the three that I had called that work for me to come
out and assist. And all three turned me down.

Q. Not only did you tell Detective Fuhrman in that telephone
conversation that you had a double homicide, you told him that it may
involve the ex-wife of O.J. Simpson, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And what response, if any, did he have to that, sir?

A. Said he'd meet me at the station.

Q. Did he say anything to you at that time about having been involved
with O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson at any time in the past?

A. No.

Q. So he -- let me make sure -- is your memory clear on that, by the
way?

A. Yes.

Q. So you then traveled to the station, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you waited for Detective Fuhrman there?

A. I got there about five minutes before he did.

Q. And one of the things you did is, you gathered together materials
you needed in order to process the crime scene, or at least to do your
detecting at the crime scene?

A. We have homicide kits that we put in the trunks of cars.

Q. You described some of the items in your direct examination that
were in the homicide kit.

Can you go through that again real quickly for us?

A. Well, we have rechargeable flashlights that are at the station, and
they're in rechargeable receptacles, so they're charged when we need
them in the middle of the night. So we go back to our homicide room,
get our flashlights, get our notebooks, a map if we needed to find out
where we're going. And our homicide kits basically stay inside our
cars; they're assigned to us. So the homicide kit is always in the
car. But flashlights and stuff like that stay charged in the station,
not in the car.

Q. Okay. In the homicide kit, there are items such as gloves and
plastic bags and so forth, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, outside the scope.

THE COURT: You opened the door.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Isn't that right, sir?

A. There are plastic surgical gloves that we have for that we put on
our hands, yes.

Q. And there are also plastic bags of various sizes, aren't there?

A. Plastic, paper.

Q. Okay.

A. All sizes and shapes.

Q. My question is, weren't there plastic bags there?

A. Yes.

Q. You added paper?

A. I apologize.

Q. There are also swatches in the kit; is that right?

A. No.

Q. You sure about that?

A. I don't have any swatches in mine.

Q. Do you know if any detectives --

A. I'm sure there are some detectives that may have swatches. I don't
have any swatches in my homicide kit.

Q. Why don't you tell the jury what a swatch is, sir.

A. It's a little clip of material.

Q. And what's it used for?

A. Obtain evidence, picking up evidence, picking up blood.

Q. Is it primarily used to pick up blood evidence, sir?

A. It certainly is.

Q. Now, when you arrived at the Bundy crime scene, you parked down at
the intersection of Dorothy and Bundy, right, south of the crime
scene; is that right?

A. I believe I parked south of the crime scene. And if I remember
correctly, I parked -- I turned right on Dorothy and parked on the
south side of Dorothy, east of Bundy.

Q. That would be at the southern end of the alley that runs behind the
Bundy residence, right?

A. No. I said I parked on the east side of Bundy, on the south side of
Dorothy. But when I came up northbound on Bundy, I made a right turn
and parked on the south side of Dorothy, east of Bundy.

Q. Okay. You were met by Sergeant Rossi, who then transferred you to
Officer Riske, correct?

A. He didn't transfer me.

Q. He directed you to?

A. He called Officer Riske over to me because I asked who was the
officer that had been there the longest and knew the most about the
case.

Q. And you did a very cursory walk-through of the scene at that point?

A. Yes.

Q. You did very little detecting, if any, at this point, right?

A. I rarely do any detecting; I'm a supervisor. I do an initial
walk-through; I see what's there; and then I assign someone to that
case.

Q. Would you agree with me that, actually, up until the point you were
relieved in this case, that is, that you were told that
robbery/homicide division would take over, that you did absolutely
nothing, other than a cursory walk-through?

A. That's correct.

Q. Do you remember that?

So when you were asked before, you know, whether you saw bloody
footprints inside the residence, or whether there was ransacking and
so forth, that was based on absolutely nothing, other than a cursory
walk-through, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. All right. Same thing with regard to whether there were two gloves
at the scene, right?

A. Only one glove was pointed out to me at the crime scene.

Q. My question is that your testifying in front of this jury that
there was only one glove that you saw, was based on absolutely nothing
other than a cursory walk-through, right?

A. There was only one glove at the crime scene.

Q. Can you answer my question, sir?

A. I'm answering it. There was only one glove at the crime scene that
I saw.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, can I ask that the witness be directed to
answer my question.

THE COURT: Answer his questions.

THE WITNESS: I'll answer your question again.

Q. What part of it didn't you understand?

A. I'd like you to repeat it.

Q. Isn't it true, sir, that when you told this jury that you only saw
that you -- you only saw one glove, that there weren't two gloves at
the scene, that it was based on absolutely nothing other than a
cursory walk-through; isn't that true sir?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, you described what you did in this walk-through, and you went
into the residence with whom? Who did you say you went into the
residence with?

A. Officer Riske and Detective Fuhrman.

Q. Okay. And was there anyone else with you?

Just those two; is that right?

A. Inside the residence?

Q. Right.

A. On the initial walk-through, yes.

Q. And you did the initial walk-through; you came outside. And
Detective Fuhrman came out with you, right?

Detective Fuhrman and Officer Riske came out and you exited after the
initial walk-through; isn't that right?

A. Yes.

Q. There's no question about that in your mind?

A. He was with me the whole time, until we were through with take
walk-through, so he exited when I exited.

Q. Yeah, he came out with you?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. Okay. And you didn't see Detective Roberts when you were in the
residence, right?

A. Detective Roberts came at about 2:30 that morning.

Q. Okay.

A. I saw him in the alley.

Q. My question was, when you went -- when you were in the residence
with Detective Fuhrman in the initial walk-through, you didn't see
Detective Roberts, right?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. You didn't see him until he was outside in the alleyway?

A. At about 2:30, yes.

Q. So you did the initial walk-through; you came out with Fuhrman and
Riske, and you were informed that you were being taken off the case,
or at least you were informed that you might be taken off the case?

A. There was a discussion, and Lieutenant Spangler made that decision
and informed me that was his decision. He's my commanding officer. And
I made the necessary phone calls to relieve us of that investigation.

Q. Okay. And you said, yeah; you made a couple of phone calls. And
now, Fuhrman was still outside with you, right?

A. I think at that time Fuhrman had possibly walked back into the
house through the garage.

Q. How do you know that?

A. Because I saw him walk him in through the garage. He told me he was
going to go into the house and take some notes, write his notes.

Q. Did he go in by himself?

A. I believe so.

Q. Okay. And then at some point, you had to go back in to retrieve
Detective Fuhrman, right, after you were relieved?

A. Chronological order: Detective Roberts then showed up and asked me
where Detective Fuhrman was. And I told him he was in the house. And
he went in the house, and then Detective Fuhrman, after I was relieved
of the case, walked in and informed both of them that the case was no
longer ours, and that we were leaving the residence.

Q. Okay. You all came out together?

A. All walked out together and walked back to Bundy and Dorothy.

Q. Okay. You walked around and you came around front, right?

A. Correct.

Q. You made no stops?

A. No.

Q. Okay. And by the way, when you saw Detective Fuhrman -- well, let
put this it this way: Every time you saw Detective Fuhrman that day,
he was in short sleeves, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Yeah. In fact, it would be uncommon for him to have a jacket on,
wouldn't it?

A. I think I said that in the trial; he had a habit of not wearing
jackets.

Q. Right. In fact, that's something that would stick out in your mind,
if he was wearing a jacket, right?

A. I asked him to put his jacket on a lot of times. But he didn't have
it on.

Q. You didn't on this occasion, did you?

A. No, I didn't ask him to put it on in.

Q. Your memory is clear on this point, that he was in short sleeves
the whole time that you saw him, correct?

A. To my knowledge, every time I saw him, he had no jacket on.

Q. You told us on direct examination that after you came out with
Roberts and Fuhrman and walked around back to Bundy, you all went down
to the intersection of Dorothy and Bundy, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And I think the words you used were that you "stood down," right?

A. We were no longer going to do an investigation, so we just -- the
investigation was over, as far as West L.A. Homicide was concerned.

Q. Okay.

A. It was just a term, "stood down."

Q. What that means is, you guys just -- you stood around and you
waited for somebody to show up and decide what, if anything, you were
going to do, correct?

A. Waiting for robbery/homicide detectives.

Q. I forgot one thing and my esteemed seem colleague has reminded me.

When you were back in the kitchen in your initial walk-through, did
you notice a Levis jacket or jeans-type jacket in the kitchen?

A. I believe it was on a counter.

Q. Okay.

A. And I can't tell you which counter it was on.

Q. But it's something you noticed when you did the walk-through,
right?

A. I, in the back of my mind, remember something about a jacket or a
Levis jacket someplace in that house.

Q. Was that --

A. It was in the kitchen area of the house.

Q. Was that something that was pointed out to you by Officer Riske?

A. I don't know if he pointed it out to me or I just observed it, but
I did see it.

Q. Do you know if anybody photographed the jacket?

A. I didn't do anything with photographs, sir.

Q. Do you know if anyone ever collected the jacket?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. LEONARD: May I be heard, Your Honor?

THE COURT: You may.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. LEONARD: Wait for everybody to get here.

I think the door's been opened. I know what your ruling is, and I
accepted it at the time it was made. But I believe the door has been
opened.

Mr. Medvene asked this witness if he saw any blood, bloody footprints
in the residence, if it appeared to be ransacked. This witness has
said it was a crime scene.

I really think it's unfair for him to leave the impression with the
jury and the inference that everything that was important was noted
and checked.

THE COURT: Was there blood on the jacket?

MR. LEONARD: Was there blood on the jacket? We'll never know; it
wasn't collected. That's the point.

THE COURT: The point is this: You guys are blowing up a smoke screen.
And I made a prior ruling on the basis of smoke screen. You know we
went through a real process of going through motions. You submitted
substantial briefs. I read all of the briefs; I made a ruling. I'm
going to stick by it.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, just, I'm not going to let -- with all due
respect, I'm not going to let that remark pass.

I don't believe this is a smoke screen. I've tried a number of
criminal cases, homicides, all over the country.

THE COURT: This is not a criminal case.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, with all due respect --

THE COURT: This is not a case of reasonable doubt. When you're saying
the police department failed to take action which prevented the
defendant from establishing this reasonable doubt, this is not a
criminal case.

This case is really simple; it's a case in which the plaintiff has to
prove by the evidence that was obtained that your client did it.

If they can't do that, you win. We're not trying the police
department.

MR. BAKER: You made a couple of rulings. One is, they made a motion
under 664 that put the police or officials are presumed to do their
duty. That's what they put before this jury.

Now, our case is, they didn't do their duty. And what you're allowing
by your ruling -- and I understand about in the Kaurish case that
there are different methods of collection.

What you're allowing is, I think, a smoke screen. You're allowing this
jury to hear that this police department does everything right, and
it's that evidence -- that is the only evidence that's viable relative
to this murder scene.

THE COURT: That precludes --

MR. BAKER: -- from showing that they have their minds made up before
they ever went to Rockingham. That just precludes us from showing that
this police department didn't -- for example, if you take that Levis
jacket, there will be testimony that Mark Fuhrman took that Levi
jacket, we believe.

We further believe that there will be testimony Mark Fuhrman was
wearing a jacket, that he had a jacket on until 3 o'clock in the
morning. And that the importance of this is, he had some place where
he could plant this glove. And we think it's important to talk about
opportunities.

And when you preclude us all over the place by saying we're putting up
a smoke screen, I think that's absolutely untrue.

Their whole evidence is police evidence. Their whole evidence, their
whole case, is police evidence.

You say, well, it isn't a criminal case, and it's by a preponderance
of the evidence.

It seems to me that, since it's by a lesser standard, that the burden
--

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, if you're going to be offering evidence that
Fuhrman had a jacket on, fine. But put it on in your phase of the
case.

MR. BAKER: Well, Judge, you precluded us from putting everything on.

THE COURT: Now you can put a jacket on; if you've got a witness to put
a jacket on, put a jacket on.

MR. BAKER: I've got a witness that will put a jacket on Fuhrman.

THE COURT: Maybe you do, maybe you don't.

MR. BAKER: Well, I mean, you're just taking our whole case; that's my
whole point.

THE COURT: I made my ruling.

MR. BAKER: Let me finish. Let me make my record.

THE COURT: I made my ruling.

MR. BAKER: Let me make my record.

THE COURT: You made your record.

MR. BAKER: My record is, when there's less of a burden of proof, it's
even more important that we get to put this evidence on.

Now I've made my record.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, if you persist in that manner of presenting
your evidence, I will consider that the door eventually will be
opened.

MR. MEDVENE: I understand, Your Honor.

MR. LEONARD: That's great. This is their last police witness.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. LEONARD: Ready?

THE WITNESS: No, it won't pour, sir.

(Referring to pitcher of water.)

THE WITNESS: Sorry about that.

MR. LEONARD: No problem.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) When you were out in the -- when you were standing
out at Dorothy and Bundy for the -- what was it, the one hour and
fifteen-minute time period, approximately?

A. Well, 2:40 to about 4:05.

Q. Okay. You saw everything that Mark Fuhrman did, right?

A. He was standing in the intersection with us.

Q. He didn't go anywhere?

A. No, sir.

Q. With anyone?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you ever see Detective Fuhrman go anywhere with Lieutenant
Spangler?

A. When you say go anywhere with him, I don't know what you mean by go
anywhere. You mean leave the area?

Q. Yeah, leave Dorothy and Bundy and go up towards the crime scene.

A. Well, I thought you meant left Dorothy and Bundy and left the area.
I apologize.

Q. I apologize. It was an unclear question. You're very right.

A. No. I thought you meant did he leave that area.

No, I didn't. Lieutenant Spangler, Mark Fuhrman and I, at one time, I
believe, walked up to the house north of the condo and viewed the back
of Ron Goldman through the iron gate, the iron fence there.

Q. Now, at that time -- at that time, did you see Mark Fuhrman
actually touch the glove in any way?

A. I never saw Mark Fuhrman touch the glove.

Q. Did you ever see him at any point manipulate the glove in any way
by touching it with a pen or any other item?

A. I never saw him do that.

I understand what you're talking about. But I never saw him do that.

Q. Okay. You never saw it?

A. I never saw it personally, no.

Q. And you never saw the photograph being taken that you say was taken
at what, about 7:30 or 7 o'clock in the morning?

A. I would say somewhere around 6:45, I saw Mark Fuhrman and a
photographer walking to that direction, but I never saw the actual
photograph taken.

Q. You were down at --

A. Dorothy --

Q. -- Dorothy and Bundy.

And they walked up Bundy, right?

A. Well, they walked across the street and up onto the same property,
to the front of 875 South Bundy. I saw him walking that way, and told
the photographer that we wanted to go. And my attention was taken back
to Lieutenant Spangler and Lieutenant Rodgers, and I never saw the
photograph being taken.

Q. Who else was in the immediate area of the front of the crime scene
at the time the photograph was taken, sir, if anyone?

A. I don't recall seeing anybody there.

Q. Your memory is no one was there, right?

A. I don't recall seeing anybody at that location other than Mark and
the photographer, walking up to the front of that location.

Q. Do you recall being aware of a flash going off from a camera?

A. As I stated, I did not see the photograph being taken, so I did not
see a flash.

Q. And it was broad daylight when the photograph was taken, right?

A. 6:40 in the morning; yes.

Q. No question about that in your mind, right?

A. None.

Q. Did you -- before you went over to Rockingham, you had a
run-through first with Detective Vannatter, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And then again after that with Detective Lange?

A. Yes.

Q. When you went through the crime scene with Detective Vanatter,
among other things, you showed him the glove, the blood on the gate
that had been pointed out to you, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you showed him the three spots that you say you saw blood on
the gate, right?

A. I showed him the bottom rung, the top rung, and the latch.

Q. Okay. And the latch in that gate is on the far left and there's a
vertical bar, correct?

A. It's on the east side of the gate, on the inside of the property
gate, and it's on the left-hand side.

Q. All the way on the far left of the gate, right? All the way at the
edge?

A. Right. So it's a lock.

Q. Okay. And whereabouts on the latch did you see the blood?

A. It was underneath the latch, on the under portion of it.

Q. Okay. And that's all the blood that was pointed out to you, those
three spots; that's the only place you saw blood that was pointed out
to you, right?

A. Those three areas.

Q. That's what you pointed out to Detective Vanatter?

A. Yes.

Q. That's what you pointed out to Detective Lange, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Again, that was pointed out to you by Officer Riske, right?

A. Yes.

Q. No question about that in your mind?

A. Well, I don't know that the latch was pointed out by Officer Riske.
I think Mark Fuhrman is the one that told me about that spot on the
latch.

Q. Okay.

A. I did not hear Riske say that about the latch. Mark pointed that
out and shined his flashlight on it.

Q. Well, in any event --

A. It was done during the initial walk-through.

Q. Okay. But it was those three areas?

A. That's correct.

Q. All right. When's the last time you've seen a photograph that
purports to depict the blood on the gate, sir? When was the last time
you saw one of those?

A. This morning.

Q. Oh, you did?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

A. I told you, that was the photograph that I saw this morning.

Q. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about the photograph over
at Rockingham?

A. No, sir.

Q. Okay.

A. The one at the gate.

Q. Okay. That photograph showed that all three of the areas; is that
right?

A. I don't know if you can see them all in one photograph. I looked at
the photographs of the rear gate.

Q. Okay. And they were shown to you by some of the lawyers sitting
here, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was in -- they were trying to prepare you for your
testimony today, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusion.

THE COURT: Overruled. Well, they were trying to prepare, yeah. I'll
sustain that. His state of mind, not the witness's state of mind.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Did you understand what the purpose was for them
showing you the photograph, sir, this morning?

A. Yes.

Q. What was that for?

A. I asked to look at it.

Q. Okay. In preparation for testifying, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay. Did you make any comments to them about the photograph at
that point?

A. No comment other than I recognized it.

Q. Did you tell them that you couldn't see the blood on the latch? Did
you tell them that?

A. There's no photograph that I know of that shows the blood on the
latch.

Q. Well, that's right because there's no photograph at all that shoes
that -- is there?

A. I said that there is no photograph that I've ever seen of the blood
on the latch.

Q. You know if the blood on the latch was ever collected, sir?

A. I don't know what was checked at that crime scene.

Q. No idea?

A. I have never seen the property report or the lab reports as to what
was checked at any -- either location. It was not my investigation.

Q. Would it surprise you to learn that the blood wasn't checked on the
latch, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative. Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. LEONARD: Withdrawn.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, you've said that you went over to Rockingham
for two reasons, right?

A. I went there for one reason.

Q. Well, you indicated to us in direct examination that when I say
you, and I apologize. I'm talking about the group, you went over --
four detectives went over there, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And there was a dual purpose. Two of the detectives had one purpose
and the two of the detectives had another purpose, right?

A. Mark Fuhrman was coming along because I was taking with me because
I was going to use him to notify Mr. Simpson to do whatever I had to
do.

Q. He was also coming because he knew how to get there?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you knew how to get there, but he had been there before and he
told you guys that?

A. Told us he'd been up to that residence before.

Q. He told you he had been there because he had responded to an
alleged incident over there; is that right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. LEONARD: Goes to state of mind.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. LEONARD: Can we approach?

THE COURT: No.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) When you -- when you went over to Rockingham,
Detectives Vannatter and Lange, as you've said in your direct
testimony, went over there because they wanted to speak with Mr.
Simpson, correct?

A. That's what they said.

Q. And they told you that they wanted to speak with Mr. Simpson
because they wanted to know where Nicole Brown Simpson had been the
night before; is that right?

A. They wanted to introduce themselves to Mr. Simpson. Find out
whatever information they could find out about the deceased and
anything he may know about what happened last night. Their reasons for
going there are their reasons.

Q. Well, but you testified on direct examination --

A. I'm telling you -- tell you --

Q. Correct me if I'm wrong, one of the reasons they wanted to go over
there, they wanted to talk to O.J. Simpson about the whereabouts of
Nicole Brown Simpson the night before. Did you not say that on direct
examination?

A. Yes.

Q. Is there any other reason that they, that they told you they were
going over there? Any other reason that they wanted to speak to Mr.
Simpson?

A. Not that recall.

Q. There could have been, but you just don't recall?

A. That was the reasons I think they went over there, those reasons
and then there may have been more.

Q. Well, could it be that Mr. Simpson was a suspect at this time?

A. No.

Q. You're sure about that?

A. I'm positive.

Q. That thought never entered your mind, sir?

A. It was never talked about, never entered my mind No one ever
mentioned to me that he was a suspect at that time. Certainly wasn't a
suspect to me.

Q. At any point, sir, up until the time that Detective Fuhrman went
over the wall at Rockingham, were you ever apprised of the fact that
Detective Fuhrman had responded on two occasions to Rockingham? Were
you ever apprised of that, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Lack of foundation. Relevance. Materiality.

THE COURT: Sustained. This witness -- sustained.

What he -- whether he knew about it or not, that's irrelevant.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Who made the decision to go over the wall?

A. Vannatter and Lange.

Q. Was there a discussion about why they were going over the wall?

A. Between them?

Q. You didn't hear any of that?

A. I was on my cell phone, out in the middle of the street. They
walked up to me and said, "we're going to go over the wall. We're
going to go onto the property."

And I said, "okay."

Q. At that time, when you were on your cell phone, did -- Detective
Fuhrman split off from the group; is that right?

A. Right. And went over to the Bronco, yes.

Q. He had gone around the corner from Ashford, down to the Bronco,
right?

A. Yes.

Q. And at that time, there was a black and white there?

A. No.

Q. When did the back and white arrive?

A. I called for the black and white after the blood was found on the
Bronco, what appeared to be blood was found on the Bronco. I called
for a black and white.

Q. And before what? On direct examination, you were talking about
going over the wall, and you said something like on direct
examination.

There was some information we had that made us have some concern for
the safety of individuals inside the house. Remember saying that?

A. Yes.

Q. And that information was an amount of blood on the Bronco, is that
right, that was found by Fuhrman?

A. That was the deciding factor that had Vannatter and Lange concerned
with what was going on inside that house, yes.

Q. And you were concerned, too, right?

A. Sir, it wasn't my investigation. I was on the telephone, talking to
different people, trying to get addresses and phone numbers and get
someone contacted in the house. So I wasn't privy to a lot of the
conversation between Vannatter and Lange.

Q. That wasn't my question, sir. My question was: Were you concerned
after you learned from Mr. Fuhrman that there was a small amount of
blood on the -- above the door of the Bronco, that there might be some
safety issues concerning individuals inside the residence?

A. Yes.

Q. Were you concerned about that?

A. Yes.

Q. And is it your testimony that at that point, you called for backup?

A. We didn't call. We called for a black and white to come to the
location to protect the Bronco.

Q. Okay. And who did you speak to about that, the watch commander?

A. Possibly did, through the watch commander, asked that they send a
unit up. I don't recall exactly how it was done. Either over police
radio or the cell phone.

Q. You remember talking to the watch commander?

A. Well, if I did it on the cell phone, I talked to the commander. I
did it over the police radio. I talked to a dispatcher.

Q. We have your cell phone records.

A. I don't recall exactly which way it was done, sir.

Q. Okay. But in any event, it's clear in your mind that the purpose of
the black and white to be there was to protect the Bronco, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And it had nothing to do with door-knocking, right?

A. They weren't, no. It had nothing to do with that.

Q. What is door-knocking?

A. Going up to a door and knocking on it.

Q. You trying to be facetious?

A. No, I'm not. You're asking what door-knocking is. I'm going up to a
door and knocking on it. I'm not trying to be cute with you. It's the
answer to your question.

I apologize if I've offended you. You asked me what door-knocking was.

Q. Is door-knocking a term of art in police work, sir?

A. It's walking up to a door, knocking on the door and trying to raise
somebody.

Q. To what end?

A. To talk to somebody.

Q. And it's your testimony under oath here, that those -- that you did
not ask for those officers to come over to the Rockingham scene for
the purpose of door-knocking. Is that your testimony, sir?

A. That's my testimony.

Q. In fact, there would be no reason to do any door-knocking at that
point, would there, over at Rockingham?

A. The purpose --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Objection. Asked for, conclusion.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MR. MEDVENE: It's argumentative and calls for a conclusion.

THE COURT: Asked argumentatively. I don't know that it's an
argumentative question.

MR. LEONARD: I don't know what that means, Your Honor.

THE COURT: It means you can ask it a little more politely.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. I'm sorry.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) There wasn't any reason, Officer, excuse me,
Detective Phillips, for any officers to be door-knocking at that time
at Rockingham; isn't that fair to say?

A. We were going to do a door-knock. We were going to go onto the
property and knock on the front door.

Q. No.

A. I must be completely lost with you now.

Q. Okay. What I'm -- let me make my question very clear.

You would agree with me, would you not, that at the time that the
black and white arrived -- strike that.

At the time you requested the black and white to come over to
Rockingham, there would be no reason for officers to respond to
Rockingham for purposes of door-knocking in the neighborhood; would
you agree with that?

THE COURT: Are you referring to him as an officer, as well?

MR. LEONARD: I'm not talking about the black and white officers that
he asked for. I apologize.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Go ahead and answer the question if you understand it.

THE WITNESS: You asked if they were brought there to door-knock in the
neighborhood, now?

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Yes.

A. There were no police officers brought to Rockingham that morning,
at that time, to knock on doors in the neighborhood.

Q. Again, there would be no reason to do that?

A. At that time, no.

Q. Okay. I apologize.

A. Apologize?

Q. That was a little rough.

THE COURT: That's enough apologizing. Let's get another question.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Do you remember the names of any of the officers
in the black and white?

A. I assume we're talking about the black and white at Rockingham.

Q. Yeah. I'm sorry. The black and white at Rockingham.

A. It was Officer Ashton and Officer Gonzalez.

Q. Okay. At some point, you interviewed Officer Gonzalez; is that
right?

A. Yes.

Q. When was that; do you know?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, Your Honor. It's
outside the scope.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, if I can, I can either tell you here or tell
you over there, it's to lay foundation for this document alone. I
don't intend to ask him any questions.

THE COURT: Okay. Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Do you remember when you --

A. I don't recall the date that I interviewed Gonzalez or Ashton.

Q. Okay. Would it -- do you recall being asked, I think you were asked
that in April of '95, did you do some interviews. Do you remember
that?

A. Was I asked that today?

Q. Yeah. Did you do some -- Strike that.

Did you do some interviews of officers in April of '95 that were
involved in the Simpson investigation?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. MEDVENE: Relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Interviewed some officers, yes. I don't know if it was
April.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You recall being assigned to interview officers
who had been involved in the Bundy and the Rockingham crime scenes,
right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And that was after the criminal trial had started, right? April of
-- it occurred in April of '95?

A. I don't know when I interviewed those officers. I don't know if --
whether the trial was going on or not.

Q. Okay.

MR. LEONARD: May I approach?

(Counsel reviews document.)

MR. PETROCELLI: What's the exhibit number?

MR. LEONARD: 2107.

MR. P. BAKER: It's already marked as 1800.

MR. LEONARD: I'm sorry, pre-marked as 1800.

(The instrument described herein, Statement of Daniel Gonzalez from
interview conducted by Ron Phillips, was marked Defendant's Exhibit
1800 for identification.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Showing you what's been marked as 1800, i ask you
if you can review that. When you're finished looking at it, I want to
ask you one or two questions.

A. It's a statement of Daniel H. Gonzalez from the interview that was
conducted by myself.

Q. Okay.

A. And it has to do with the evidence that surrounds this case.

Q. Okay. And what's the date of that report?

A. Doesn't have a date on it.

Q. Is that unusual for a report not to be dated?

A. Very unusual.

Q. It's supposed to be dated, right?

A. They should -- I should have dated it.

Q. Having looked at it, does it refresh your recollection, memory, at
all as to when the report was created?

A. I don't recall exactly when I made the report. It was during the
beginning sometime -- of the trial -- somewhere. And I can't give you
a date.

Q. Okay. And by the way, when you -- when you interviewed detective --
excuse me -- Officer Gonzalez, who was one of the officers in the
black and white at Rockingham --

A. Yes.

Q. -- did you have the benefit of any other reports about Gonzalez's
activities that day?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance. Hearsay. Materiality. The witness
is available.

MR. LEONARD: It's just to establish foundation. We do intend to call
Officer Gonzalez in our case, and I would like not to have to recall
this witness for this purpose.

MR. MEDVENE: Out -- also outside the scope, Your Honor. This witness
is available.

MR. LEONARD: Last question on this, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.

MR. LEONARD: Scout's honor.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Did you, sir, look at anything else relating to
Gonzalez, any other reports, including Gonzalez's handwritten notes
with reference to his activities on that day, at the time you did this
interview?

A. We -- you just answered my own question. It wasn't -- didn't
remember if he had his own handwritten notes. I guess he did. That's
what I use -- would have used when I interviewed him and made that
report.

Q. So you have a memory of doing that?

A. I thought there was some other notes that he had written, and you
said there was, so I'm sure of it now.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. While we're at it, Your Honor, may I approach?

THE COURT: Who?

MR. LEONARD: This guy here.

(Counsel approaches witness stand.)

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. PETROCELLI: Which exhibit?

MR. LEONARD: It's the Thompson report.

MR. P. BAKER: Thompson report, 2104.

MR. LEONARD: 2104.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Showing you what's been marked as 2104, and ask
you if you can review that, sir, and then I will ask you some
questions.

A. This is a statement of Thompson taken by myself on April 7, 1995 at
0720 hours in the morning.

Q. What I would -- first of all, now having read that, does that
refresh your recollection as to approximately when you interviewed
Gonzalez?

A. No. It tells me when I interviewed Thompson, but I would only be
guessing when I interviewed Gonzalez.

Q. I don't want you to guess but what I would like you to do is
carefully read the document and make sure that that is an accurate
description of what was told to you, as best as you can remember, by
Thompson.

A. You want me to read the whole document?

Q. No. No, read it to yourself.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope. The witness is available.
It's also going to call for hearsay.

MR. LEONARD: Can we go to side bar?

THE COURT: Are you going to ask him questions about this document?

MR. LEONARD: I'm just laying a foundation on this, a document we tried
to get in before through Gonzalez -- I mean through Thompson. I just
want to make --

THE COURT: Just foundation?

MR. LEONARD: Yes.

THE COURT: You got it.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Had a chance to read it?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Does that comport with your memory of what was told to you by
Officer Thompson on that occasion?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay. And the purpose of your interviewing Officer Thompson was to
have him describe what he did in relation to the crime scene on the
13th. Excuse me. On the 13th; is that right?

A. At both crime scenes, I believe.

Q. What was the purpose?

A. It was to straighten out -- explain better, I guess.

Q. Okay. And you were asking him -- you asked him to tell you
everything he did observe; is that right, sir?

A. I interviewed him and put down his statements, yes.

Q. Okay. By the way, is there anything in there about Officer Thompson
observing any blood?

MR. MEDVENE: He's clearly asking for hearsay. He knows he's asking for
it, Your Honor.

MR. LEONARD: Prior inconsistent statement.

MR. MEDVENE: Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Just a minute. You want to do some impeaching? Why don't
you do it on your part of the questions.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, it's a prior inconsistent statement of the
witness that was just here.

THE COURT: I understand that. Just explain the side of the case.

MR. LEONARD: I understand. May we reopen?

THE COURT: Let's do things in order.

MR. LEONARD: May we reopen it for this purpose only with this witness?

THE COURT: No. Put your defense on when your time comes.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Prior to going over to Rockingham, did you ask
Officer Riske to run the plates on the jeep to try to find out an
address that was registered to? Did you do that?

A. No.

Q. You'd have no reason to do that.

MR. MEDVENE: Argumentative, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Did you have any reason to do that at that time?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I didn't do that.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You didn't have any reason to do it, right?

A. Sir, I didn't do it. Would it be done? I didn't have a reason to do
it.

Q. Now, Detective Fuhrman went over the wall. And before that, you
said that a Westec unit had arrived; is that right?

A. Both Westec units arrived before Fuhrman went over the wall.

Q. Okay. And how much in time, prior to Fuhrman going over the wall,
did the first Westec unit arrive?

A. Possibly about ten minutes because I had talked to him for a little
bit, obtained a fence number, looked at the Bronco, made a phone call,
got no answer and went over the wall.

Q. Westec unit stayed there the whole time?

A. He was parked in the middle of the intersection, yes.

Q. He was parked. You indicated that he arrived and was heading up
north on Rockingham?

A. No, I didn't. I said that the first Westec officers came southbound
on Rockingham. The second Westec supervisor came northbound on
Rockingham.

Q. Okay. And the first -- the first Westec units then, at the time
that Fuhrman went over the wall and for ten minutes before that, was
parked in the intersection facing in a southward direction, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And with the headlights on, right? You didn't, the vehicle had it's
headlights on, right?

A. I can't recall if it had the headlights on or not.

Q. You don't remember?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Could have?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Now, Fuhrman goes over the wall, unlatches the gate. You all go
behind. You go to the rear of the Rockingham residence. You knock on
Kato's door, right?

A. We went to the front of the residence, sir.

Q. You went -- Okay. You couldn't gain entry then. You went around and
do you recall that you knocked on Kato's door to try to arouse him?

A. Yes.

Q. You didn't know it was Kato in there. You knocked on the door. You
had and idea that someone was in the door, correct? In the room,
correct?

A. After I saw an arm, I thought somebody was in there.

Q. Okay. And he opened the door, and a question was put to him
immediately, right?

A. Yes.

Q. The question basically was, where is Mr. Simpson, right?

A. Where is Mr. Simpson or do you know where Mr. Simpson is.

Q. And he responded immediately, didn't he? Did his plane crash or
words to that effect?

A. No.

Q. Do you remember that?

A. He never said that.

Q. Never said that?

A. Never said that.

Q. So if he testifies to that, he's lying; is that right, sir?

A. I never heard Mr. Kato Kaelin say, did his plane crash.

Q. So if he comes into court and testifies to that, he's lying; is
that right, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained. You're asking him to draw a conclusion. That's
not for him to draw.

MR. LEONARD: If he comes in and testifies to that he's incorrect;
isn't that right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Asks for conclusion.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Were you right there within ear shot of Mr. Kaelin
when he opened the door and responded to the initial question to him
about where Mr. Simpson was?

A. Yes.

Q. Were you right there?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, Mr. -- Detective Fuhrman, he stayed behind with Mr. Kaelin and
Detective Lange and Detective Vannatter walked down to Arnelle
Simpson's room, right?

A. Yes.

Q. You got her up, right?

A. Knocked on the door and she answered the door.

Q. And she was asked some questions as well, correct?

A. She was asked questions, if she knew where her father was,
something to that effect?

Q. What was her response.

A. She responded by answering the question like, isn't he there or
isn't he here?

Q. You're sure about, right?

A. Something along these lines, isn't he here or isn't he there.
Something along that line. She answered it with a question.

Q. And then you requested of her that she permit you to enter the
residence?

A. No. I didn't talk to her any more, Detective Vannatter did.

Q. Someone in your presence did?

A. I didn't listen to the conversation between her and Vannatter and
Arnelle. I walked away.

Q. But you all walked into the house together. There's no question in
your mind.

A. I did not hear the conversation between Vannatter and Arnelle
after. I asked the first question and then she went back into her
apartment and got a key, came back out and walked to the residence.

Q. Okay. May I go over there? I have to get one of the exhibits.

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. LEONARD: Think I'm going to put it up here, if I can. It okay if I
put it there?

THE COURT: As long as it doesn't fall onto one of our jurors.

MR. LEONARD: We wouldn't want that to happen.

THE COURT: Can you?

THE BAILIFF: Yeah.

MR. LEONARD: I'm sorry, Your Honor that's the wrong Exhibit.

(Counsel displays large exhibit entitled "Glove found at 360 North
Rockingham Avenue June 13, 1994.")

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now with the pointer and still holding so there's
no injury to the jury --

A. I got it.

Q. -- I want you to, first of all, identify Arnelle Simpson's room.

THE COURT: You want to identify the Exhibit?

MR. LEONARD: I'm sorry. 145.

THE COURT: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Would you identify on 145 where Arnelle Simpson's
room is?

A. It's right here, where it says Arnelle's room.

Q. Okay. That makes it easy.

Now, when you entered, you said that Arnelle went back in and she got
a key, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. That was the key to enter the residence, correct?

Well, you --

A. I would have to assume it was.

Q. Okay. In fact, you ultimately saw her use the key to get into the
residence, right?

A. Well, I was behind. I don't know whether she used the key or not.
She went up to that door and the door opened and she went inside and
we followed her.

Q. Okay. But there's no question in your mind that she -- that she had
a key?

A. I would assume she had used a key to get in.

Q. Okay. Just point out the door that you went into.

A. There's some French doors in the rear of the residence. I think
they went up these stairs and went in one of these areas in here,
which leads right into a -- it's not really a -- there's a pool table
or a billiard table just off to the left. I think it's possibly a
dining room or a den or something that we walked into.

Q. Let the record reflect that Detective Phillips has indicated that
he entered a door which is adjacent to a tree. It's right to the left
of what's depicted as tree, right above the portion of the residence
that's labeled office. Is that fair to say?

A. Is this the tree you're talking about?

Q. Yeah.

A. We entered over here.

Q. Right.

A. Okay.

Q. There's actually an opening there indicating a door?

A. I would assume so.

Q. About three inches to the left of the tree?

A. Okay.

Q. Right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. I want the record complete. Thank you.

And there's no question in your mind that that's how you gained
entrance to the residence with Arnelle Simpson?

A. That's how we went in the house.

Q. There's no question in your mind that you did not walk all the way
around and go in the front door, correct?

A. Did not.

Q. Okay. You were --

A. Shall I put this down?

Q. I'll relieve you of your duty there. I'll do that.

(Counsel takes Exhibit 145.)

Q. Now, your intent on notifying Mr. Simpson, correct?

That was what you were about when you went over there?

That was your job over there, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you wanted to make sure that Mr. Simpson learned of this tragic
incident first hand from you, correct?

A. Yes, I was ordered to do that.

Q. All right. You wanted to make sure, for instance, that you did not
tell Arnelle Simpson anything about it, right?

A. We did not until we notified her father.

Q. It was until after Mr. Simpson was notified that you -- that you
told Arnelle Simpson anything about this, right?

A. I did not notify Arnelle Simpson, Tom Lange did.

Q. And it was after that you --

A. While I was making the phone call to her father, Tom Lange started
talking to her and she became very upset. So I assume that's at the
time he advised her.

Q. Okay. But prior to her picking up the phone to call Mr. Simpson, in
Chicago, you did not tell Arnelle Simpson what had happened, right?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Nor did you hear any other officers, right?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Okay. And from the time that you left Arnelle's room, walked by the
gate, Kato room, by the office, entered the residence, and walked into
the area where you made the telephone call, you were with Arnelle
Simpson, Detective Vannatter and Detective Lange, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you -- and that's the situation -- that situation remained like
that during the time you made the phone call, right?

In other words, Arnelle Simpson was right next to you?

A. Yes.

Q. You could hear her react to what you were telling Mr. Simpson?

A. Well, she handed me the phone after -- when she called Cathy Randa.
I'm sorry, she handed me the phone and I talked to Cathy. Then I
phoned her father myself and she was standing behind me.

Q. Did you just say that she handed you the phone when you spoke to
Mr. Simpson?

A. No. I misspoke. I said when she was talking to Cathy Randa, she
handed me the phone. She was standing right next to me and then I hung
up from that phone call and dialed 411 and got the phone number. And
then I called Chicago and she was standing in the same vicinity, was
talking to Lange.

Q. Okay. But just so it's clear, you walked in the back entrance,
right? You did not walk around to the front?

A. Walked in the back.

Q. And you never told Arnelle prior to making the call to Mr. Simpson
that there had been a homicide and that Nicole Brown Simpson was
involved?

MR. MEDVENE: Asked and answered.

THE COURT: About three times.

MR. LEONARD: I'll withdraw. May I approach?

THE COURT: I guess. Go ahead.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Just show you what's -- I'm sorry.

(Plaintiffs' counsel review documents.)

MR. MEDVENE: We just did this.

MR. LEONARD: Did we?

MR. MEDVENE: (Nods affirmatively.)

MR. LEONARD: False alarm.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, when you finished your discussion with Mr.
Simpson on the telephone, you -- where did you go? Right out and stood
outside, right in front of the kitchen?

A. Breakfast -- I call it a breakfast nook area there were a couple of
French doors that open right there and I stood right in that area.

Q. And was it -- were you -- were you insides or outside?

A. I think I was standing in the doorway.

Q. By the way, did, at the end of this discussion with Mr. Simpson,
did you give him your beeper number?

A. Yes.

Q. Gave him my beeper number and my phone number at the station.

Q. And at that point, after you went outside, Mister or Detective
Fuhrman came around and told you that he had found something?

A. Yes.

Q. You walked down that path behind the Rockingham residence with him,
right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you got within three or four feet of the glove, correct?

A. Right. Yes.

Q. And you weren't close in enough to see whether the glove was
bloody?

A. I didn't get close enough to the glove.

Q. Did you ever walk behind, beyond, the air conditioner that's in the
wall down there, near where the glove was found?

A. I eventually did, but much later in the day.

Q. What was your purpose in going back there?

A. I think there was a whole bunch of us that walked back there. I
just followed them.

I think the D.A. went back there. We're just basically walking around
the property.

Q. Okay.

A. It was much, much later in the day.

Q. Was Detective Fuhrman in that group that went back there?

A. I don't know if he was in that group.

Q. Did Detective Fuhrman tell you anything about the condition of the
walkway past the air conditioner?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. LEONARD: You can answer yes or no.

MR. MEDVENE: Well, Your Honor has ruled.

THE COURT: I sustained the objection.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, when you walked back along the pathway, were
you -- were you careful to watch where you were walking?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And one of the things you were looking out for was any
evidence, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And did you see any signs of blood drops such as you saw at
Bundy?

A. No.

Q. Did you see any signs of any disturbance along the bushes that are
along the fence that's on the right hand side of that path as you walk
down?

A. No.

Q. Any identification at all along that. Someone had come over the
fence, in your opinion?

A. I observed nothing.

Q. Nothing out of ordinary in those bushes?

A. Nothing.

Q. Those are extremely thick bushes, aren't they, sir?

A. There was a lot of overhang and a lot of foliage, extreme thick
bushes. It was a lot of foliage and a lot of -- they were all hanging
over which was blocking out the light and there was a lot of them,
yeah.

MR. LEONARD: Can you cue up 147, please?

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, the photograph that's up on the Elmo now
that's marked as Exhibit 147; is that a fair and accurate depiction of
that walkway in the area where the glove was found?

A. Yes.

Q. And I know it's kind of hard to see with the pointer. Can you just
point out where the glove is in that photograph?

A. I'd have to say it's somewhere in this area here because it was
right by the air conditioner. I really can make it out.

Q. Okay. But that's the approximate area where the glove was?

A. Right.

Q. Now, just to the right. That's -- there's a fence. A fence is about
how high?

A. Five feet.

Q. Okay. And the fence has, if you can see along the top of that
fence, just describe what the very top of that fence is. What is that?

A. It's like a cyclone fence. It's jacked where the seek loan fence is
and the cut off.

Q. Okay. And again, with reference to the foliage that's along the top
of that fence, describe that for us in some detail. In other words,
tell us how thick, how thin it is?

A. Well, it's impossible for me to look at that photograph and tell
you how thick or thin it is. There's a lot of bushes there. They're
tall and they're overhanging onto Mr. Simpson's property from the
property next door.

Q. Okay. And the bushes extend or the foliage extends, what, 20 feet
up, 15 to 20 feet?

A. I don't -- they were taller than I was, sir. I don't remember how
tall they were.

Q. One of the things you look for around the area of the glove was no
sign of any disturbance in the bushes, right?

A. I never look for any of that.

Q. You didn't?

A. No.

Q. Okay. But you did look for blood drops along the path there?

A. Yes.

Q. You didn't see any?

A. I didn't see anything that stepped on -- I didn't see anything at
all.

Q. Had a flashlight?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And Detective Fuhrman had a flashlight?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay. And you were both looking along the ground there?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay. And did you come back -- come back down that path a couple
more times?

A. No. I just went down it the one time, and then Phil Vannatter went
down it, and then Tom Lange went down it. And I left the property.

Q. Okay. And they all had flashlights, to your knowledge?

A. I don't know who had a flashlight.

Q. When you entered the Rockingham residence with Arnelle Simpson and
Detective Vannatter and Detective Lange, where was Mark Fuhrman, if
you know?

A. When we walked from Arnelle's room towards the house, Mark Fuhrman
was talking to Kato Kaelin inside his room.

Shortly after arriving inside the house, I believe Mark Fuhrman
entered with Kato Kaelin, and sat him down at a bar stool. And I
remember him saying something to Vannatter, "you need to talk to this
guy."

Q. Now, Vanatter was the senior investigator at the time, right?

A. I don't really know, their being the same rank, Detective 3's. I
don't know who has more time on the job.

Q. Well, you and Fuhrman were off the case at that point.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Vague, ambiguous "off the indicate case."

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. LEONARD: I can make it clearer.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You and Fuhrman had been relieved of your duties
as investigating detectives on the case; would you agree with that?

A. We were not the investigating officers on this case at this time,
yes.

Q. Again, you had gone over there only to notify Mr. Simpson, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. You say that Fuhrman told Vannatter to interview Kato Kaelin?

A. I don't know if he said "interview." He said, "You should talk to
this guy."

Q. And Fuhrman separated himself from the group, right?

A. I don't know that. I was on the telephone.

Q. Well --

A. It all happened at the same time. I was busy talking to Arnelle
(sic) on the telephone. I overheard him say to Vannatter, "You need to
talk to this guy." And then Mark left, went out the door that was left
open. That's where I walked over to.

Q. From the time he walked out the door until you saw him again when
he came in, when he said to you, "I found something," how many minutes
is that; do you know?

Give us an estimate.

A. Five, seven minutes, something like that.

Q. Now, you went with -- you went back over to Bundy. And you say that
Fuhrman talked to photographer Rokahr; you saw him do that?

A. I told him to get a photographer.

Q. And you saw him have some exchange with photographer Rokahr, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And again, there's no question in your mind, that happened after
you came back from Rockingham, right?

A. There's no doubt in my mind.

Q. No question it was broad daylight when the photograph was taken?

A. Absolutely no doubt in my mind.

Q. Could I have a minute, Your Honor.

THE COURT: (Nods affirmatively.)

(Pause in proceedings.)

MR. LEONARD: Two more.

MR. PETROCELLI: Two more?

MR. LEONARD: Questions.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) When you -- before you went over the -- before
Fuhrman went over the wall and you entered the Rockingham property,
Detective Fuhrman took you down to the Bronco and told you he had seen
something, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And he pointed out a small amount of blood above the door handle of
the driver's side of the Bronco, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's when he pointed it out to you, right?

A. No; he pointed out something on the -- underneath the door, but I
couldn't see it.

Q. Okay. He said there was something down there; you couldn't see it?

A. I didn't have my glasses with me, so I didn't see it.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. Now, can we show the photograph of the Bronco, the
big photograph, Exhibit 108.

Hold on for a second.

(Pause in the proceedings.)

MR. LEONARD: Okay. We've he got 108 up on the Elmo.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Can you tell me, sir, what that photograph
depicts?

A. That's the Ford Bronco that was parked on Rockingham.

That is Dennis Fung, a criminalist who is pointing at an object just
above the door handle on the driver's side.

Q. Okay. And that's where you saw the spot that Detective Fuhrman
pointed out to you?

A. Yes, sir.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. Can we have the next Exhibit, please, on the Elmo.

MR. P. BAKER: That's Exhibit 109.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, Exhibit 110 that's on the Elmo, that depicts
a close-up of the spot?

A. Yes.

Q. That's the spot that appeared to you on June 13, 1994?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. It's another spot. You couldn't see the other area that Fuhrman
claimed there was blood. You couldn't see because you didn't have your
glasses with you?

A. Well, I didn't. He was pointing something out to me and I couldn't
see it.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for hearsay, Your Honor. Move to strike.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Couldn't make out what he was pointing me to.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Didn't you think about putting your glasses on?

A. I didn't see it.

MR. LEONARD: No further questions.

MR. MEDVENE: If I might just have a moment, Your Honor, to look at
this statement. We don't have very much.

(Pause in the proceedings.)

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. When you were questioned about the fence, near where the glove was
found, did you inspect the fence closely to see if there was a bend in
the fence at around the place where the glove was found, where someone
might have run over the fence?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I did not examine that fence at all.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) On the leaves and trees that were in the immediate
vicinity of where the gloves were found, did you examine that area
closely to see if there was any space between those leaves and trees?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Based upon your examination, I'm going to allow this examination.

A. I conducted absolutely no investigation into anything but viewing
the glove that Detective Fuhrman had pointed out to me, and I walked
out of the area.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Counsel asked you about a statement that you wrote
on June 13 of 1994 that was marked as 2106, a statement that you wrote
that he said dealt with your conversation with Mr. Simpson. And do you
remember he asked you to read a certain part of it?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you say in that statement, sir, at no time during the
conversation with Mr. Simpson, did he ask me any details regarding the
death of Nicole; he repeatedly said he had to get off the phone
because he was going to return to Los Angeles. Is that what you wrote?

A. Yes.

Q. Was that accurate?

A. Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: I have nothing further. Thank you very much.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Did you have your glasses on when you walked down the walkway and
looked at the fence and foliage?

A. No, sir.

MR. LEONARD: No further questions.

MR. MEDVENE: No questions.

THE COURT: You are excused. Thank you.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'd like the witness to remain on call, in view
of the Court's ruling.

THE COURT: Witness on call.

THE WITNESS: Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, we had a discussion in chambers. We are
eliminating about four witnesses to speed things up. And the next
officers to testify, the two detectives, Detective Lange and
Vannatter, are out of town and will be returning tomorrow evening.
They can be available Thursday morning.

THE COURT: What time?

MR. PETROCELLI: First thing, 8:30.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to not be in session
tomorrow, because they've altered their witness scheduling. And they
represent to me that they've dispensed with five plaintiffs'
witnesses, so I've allowed them to do that. And they're going to call
their next witness on Thursday, at 8:30.

Again, let me remind you not to talk about this case, not form or
express any opinions, not read anything about it, not watch anything
on television about it, not listen to any broadcasts on the radio
about it.

You're going to have a whole day free. You can go back to work or
whatever.

Do not allow anybody to talk to you about this case. Do not allow
anybody to make any comments to you about this case, so you do not
make any comments about this case.

Don't go to the scene; don't conduct any investigation; restrict
yourself to only the information received in the course of this trial.
Everybody understand that?

JURORS: Yes.

THE COURT: Thank you. We'll see you Thursday, 8:30.

THE CLERK: I need that last Exhibit 2106.

(At 4:16 p.m., an adjournment was taken until Thursday, October 31,
1996, at 8:30 a.m.)

REPORTER'S DAILY TRANSCRIPT
OCTOBER 31, 1996

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES


SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1996
8:30 A.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: Morning.

THE CLERK: Morning.

MR. BAKER: I'd like to place on the record that my client, Mr.
Simpson, is going to be unavailable to this court from November 12,
possibly through the end of the month, to attend the contested custody
hearings that are going on relative to his children.

I've made that representation to the plaintiffs' counsel that, if they
want to put him on, they have all next week or today and tomorrow and
whatever, but's he's available. They've known about this for a week
and a half.

I want to make it clear that he is not going to be available
subsequent to the 12th, until that proceeding is over, to be called as
a witness in this matter; and he won't be able to be present because
of the custody hearing relative to his children.

THE COURT: Did the Court in that matter indicate how long that matter
was going to go?

MR. BAKER: No, Your Honor, but it's anticipated to go at least two to
three weeks.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, if I might --

THE COURT: You may.

MR. KELLY: No one is questioning Mr. Simpson's right to be down there
for the guardianship proceedings.

What I point out is, we shouldn't be forced to realign or alter our
order of proof in this case. And the Browns, I'm sure, would have no
objection to addressing the Court down there and making any necessary
arrangements that need to be made to allow for Mr. Simpson to be up
here at the time we might choose to call him, rather than be down
there. And I'm sure we can balance the interest of the two courts and
accommodate both proceedings at the same time, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You want to make an appearance down there for that purpose,
you certainly may.

MR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor that's not --

MR. KELLY: Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: That's not the issue. The issue is, Mr. Simpson does not
want a continuance of that matter.

He's been available, and they know it. And Mr. Kelly is representing
the Browns down there, and he knows it. And they're not going to be
able to, in my view, play one case off against the other.

He's here. He's available. They can put him on next week. And they
know that, and they have known for some period of time that he will be
in that situation from November 12.

MR. KELLY: First of all, Mr. Baker clearly knows I'm not representing
the Browns down in that matter. They have other counsel in that
proceeding.

As I indicated, we would not be asking about any continuance down
there by the counsel representing them on that or the family, just
simply a couple days off for Mr. Simpson to come up here, if need be,
and appear when we decide to call him, not put the whole case off ad
infinitum, if necessary.

THE COURT: You make your appearance down there; you make your needs
known. We'll see what happens.

MR. KELLY: Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Any other matters?

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor --

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. LEONARD: If I may, we originally were asked to provide a brief on
the Fuhrman transcript issue by tomorrow.

And I talked to Mr. Gelblum, and he has agreed, if it's acceptable to
the Court, that we put that off for ten days, till the 13th of
November, if that's acceptable to you. This is an issue that wouldn't
be putting the evidence in until we begin our case, and I would ask
the Court's indulgence in that matter.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: One other final thing, Your Honor.

We had filed a little, short statement this morning on the Kelly Frye
issue, asking for the hearing on Tuesday, if necessary, that's
apparently the witness's only available slot to come in and testify.

THE COURT: All right. We'll set it for November 5, 8:30.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

THE COURT: Anything else?

(No verbal response.)

THE COURT: Okay. Bring the jury.

THE BAILIFF: They're walking.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

JURORS: Good morning, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I understand there's been a request from the jury that we
adjourn and hour early tomorrow because some of you have religious
obligations; is that correct.

JURORS: Yes.

THE COURT: So we'll adjourn tomorrow at 3:30.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

THE COURT: You may proceed.

MR. MEDVENE: Thomas Lange.

THOMAS LANGE, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiff Goldman, was
duly sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: And would you please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: Tom Lange, L-A-N-G-E.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Good morning, sir.

A. Morning.

Q. What is your current business or occupation?

A. I'm a private investigator, licensed by the State of California.

Q. And how long have you been so employed?

A. I've been a licensed private investigator since 1980.

However, I've been employed as one -- actually working as one for
about the last three months.

Q. And what do you do in the course of your work as a private
investigator?

A. I do criminal defense. I do some civil work. I am involved in a
death-penalty appeal case, things of that nature.

Q. What was your last previous occupation?

A. I was a police detective for the City of Los Angeles, assigned to
robbery/homicide division.

Q. And how long were you a police officer?

A. Just shy of 29 years.

Q. How long were you with the robbery/homicide division?

A. I was with robbery/homicide for approximately 18 years.

Q. You've been a police detective, or were a police detective for how
long?

A. Police detective for approximately 21 years.

Q. Were you in different units before joining the robbery/homicide
division as a detective in 1978?

A. Yes.

Q. And what units?

A. I worked central detectives homicide, central detectives robbery
section. I worked central detectives juvenile section. I've also
worked our detective headquarters division.

Q. Is there a difference in the function or type of matter that you
worked on as a homicide detective, for example, and your assignment as
a detective in the robbery/homicide division, homicide special section
for the last 15 years?

A. Is there a difference --

Q. Yes, sir,

A. -- in the nature of the cases handled, as opposed to other
assignments?

Q. Yes.

A. Yes. Robbery/homicide division is a so-called specialized division
that handles high-profile cases, time-consuming cases: Things such as
serial killings, multiple killings, things that tend to take more time
to investigate because the -- the fact of the matter is that, among
the 18 geographical divisions, those units are inundated; and in the
specialized division, you're afforded more time to actually work those
types of cases.

Q. Did there come a time that you became involved in the investigation
of a double murder that occurred at 875 South Bundy on June 12, 1994?

A. Yes.

Q. And when was that?

A. That was -- I was notified by telephone approximately 3:00 a.m. on
June 13, 1994.

Q. As a result of your being notified by telephone, what did you do?

A. I responded to the location at 875 South Bundy. Arrived there, I
believe, at approximately 4:20 or 4:25 a.m.

Q. And what did you do when you arrived?

A. I -- after parking my vehicle, I approached my supervisor,
Lieutenant John Rodgers, who was standing on Dorothy, in front of the
location, along with my partner at the time, Phil Vannatter. They were
standing with two other detectives.

I approached them, and my partner I believe -- Lieutenant Rodgers
introduced me to Detective Phillips, and after that, Detective
Fuhrman.

Q. Did you receive any instructions in terms of what your role was to
be in the investigation?

A. Yes; I was to understand we were going to take over the
investigation from these two detectives who worked the geographical
unit.

And my partner, Vannatter, suggested that Phillips take me on a
walk-through of the location, to familiarize myself with what they
had.

Q. From the time robbery/homicide became responsible for the
investigation, what was the role of the West Los Angeles police
officers and detectives to be?

A. They were to stand by to assist us in any way that we deemed
necessary.

Q. And from time to time, did you call upon them to assist you in the
course of your Investigation?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you meet at the scene, any officers from West Los Angeles?

A. Yes.

Well the detectives, Phillips and Fuhrman, and there were several
other West Los Angeles officers there to secure the perimeter.

Q. Now, had you ever met Detective Phillips before?

A. No.

Q. Had you ever spoken to him before?

A. No.

Q. Had you ever met Detective Fuhrman before?

A. No.

Q. Had you ever spoken to him before?

A. No.

Q. Did you meet officers Riske and Terrazas?

A. Not at that time.

Q. Had you ever met either of them before?

A. No.

Q. Did you receive a walk-through of the crime scene?

A. Yes, with Detective Phillips.

Q. And after the initial walk-through, did you have occasion to go
through a number of other walk-throughs and conduct a survey of the
property?

A. Subsequently, yes

MR. MEDVENE: Approach, Your Honor, to put up a board?

(Counsel approaches board, displays blow-up labeled 875 South Bundy
walkway.)

MR. MEDVENE: Can we have the pointer.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) With the Court's permission, Officer Lange, would
you please approach the board.

I have in front of you what's been marked Exhibit 2057. You see it has
a series of pictures on it and has a schematic to the left.

Could you first address the schematic and describe that for me.

A. This is a schematic.

On the left -- this is to scale -- is the basic floor plan at Bundy,
completed by an LAPD surveyor by the name of Howard Huckland.

The scale you see off to the left here, the front here, Bundy Drive at
the bottom of the alley, at the top -- west is at the top; east is at
the bottom; south is to your left; and north is to your right.

Q. And are the distances marked out on the left-hand side of the
schematic?

A. Yes that's to scale.

Q. Just give the ladies and gentlemen of the jury a brief feel --
could you give some idea of the distance from the alleyway to the
front of the residence, and some idea of where the walkway area comes
in, just so they can have a feel for it?

A. Well, the scale gives us 170 feet from the zero, of course, all the
way down to Bundy Drive. So this would be 170 feet.

Again, the front gate is here, and this is the walkway leading into
the residence.

And this is the walkway that goes along the north side of the
residence, all the way -- all the way down, all the way through to the
alley.

Q. Now, let's start at the bottom picture, which is Exhibit 36.

(The instrument herein referred to as a Photograph of walkway at crime
scene and close-up view of the body of victim Nicole Brown Simpson,
was marked Plaintiffs' Exhibit 36 for identification.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And that's a picture looking from where?

A. That's a picture looking from, I believe, possibly the parkway here
on Bundy in a westerly direction, to the front gate area.

It also depicts the victim lying at the foot of the steps.

Q. How was the lighting that early morning when you arrived?

A. The lighting there was -- I believe there's, like, four Malibu
lights down here. And I believe two of them were operating, but they
were extremely dull.

That, combined with the vegetation, they were very difficult to see in
the light there.

There was another lamp in this area that was projected straight up, as
if to cast light on the wall, and perhaps the numbers 875, here.

Out here in the street, there was and overhead illumination; however,
the foliage here was so thick that it blocked any illumination down in
this area.

So while there was some light, I would say it wasn't -- there wasn't a
great view.

Q. Difficult to see, walking on the street?

MR. BAKER: Leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you describe whether it was easy or difficult
to see, if you were on the sidewalk, looking in?

A. If one were to look directly west, specifically looking down here,
you'd certainly see this.

MR. BAKER: Move to strike as nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Overruled. Finish your description.

A. However, one just walking down the street, I would think that
because of the thick foliage here, to begin with, you wouldn't see
anything here until you walked right up on this. Then you would have
to turn to it, like a 90-degree turn to your right, to see anything
here because of this thick foliage, if one were walking down the
sidewalk.

If one were walking the other way, you'd possibly be more apt to see
something going north in this direction, than you would going south,
because again, this heavy foliage is right in this area here; and so
this is almost blind until you walk up on the walkway.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, if we can go up to the second picture from
the bottom -- that's Exhibit 46 -- And tell us what that is.

(The instrument herein referred to as a Photograph, close-up view of
bloody shoe print, was marked Plaintiffs' Exhibit 46 for
identification.)

A. That's the walkway just above the steps here that you see, just
above these steps. It's this area back in here.

This is the corner of the building, corner of the condominium, should
be the northeast corner.

This is the walkway going straight up to the front, to the front door,
looking west.

Here we had what appeared to be bloody shoe prints, moving to the
west.

There's also depicted here what turned out to be a blood drop. That's
at the corner of this condominium right here, was the first of four
that we located on this walkway.

Q. Now, if we go to the picture above that one, or the second picture
from the top -- that's Exhibit 47.

Does that continue your walk-through?

A. It's kind of a glare in here.

Yes; these are the three steps leading up to the front door that you
see here in the schematic. The front door is just off to the left
here, as depicted on the schematic.

Again, you can see what appear to be bloody shoe prints leading toward
that direction.

You see a little more of the steps in that one.

Q. And let me take you to the top picture of 719. What is that?

A. This is, again, in the walkway toward the rear, looking westerly.
It's looking out towards the alley that is right -- this stairwell
going up in the west is depicted right here, alongside the laundry
room of the schematic.

Here's the rear gate. Again, this is looking westerly. And that's
right in this these steps depicted right here.

Q. All right. What we're going to do now, Mr. Lange, is place a number
of exhibits on the television screen of the walkway area from the
front of the property to the back. In other words, approaching through
another direction.

I have another series of pictures. I'm going to ask to you describe
each one, if you would.

A. Okay.

Q. Would you put on the board Exhibit 32, please.

MR. PETROCELLI: TV.

MR. MEDVENE: Would you put on the TV, Exhibit 32.

(The instrument herein referred to as Front view of Bundy - photo of
walkway with body of victim Nicole Brown Simpson, was marked
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 32 for identification.)

THE WITNESS: Can we go ahead?

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yes. If you would, walk over.

A. This is a photograph looking west up the walkway, and this is the
front of the location.

One of the victims is shown here at the foot of the stairs. And this
is how I recall the scene the morning that I arrived.

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, Your Honor. Would it be possible to dim the
lights a little bit, if that makes it easier for the jury. I don't
know if it will or not.

THE COURT: Can you see?

JURORS: (Nod affirmatively)

THE COURT: Do you have any problems seeing? (Indicating to jurors)

JUROR: I can't see very well.

THE COURT: All right; dim the lights.

JUROR: Oh that's better.

THE COURT: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And when we go through, maybe you can generally
relate the picture on the TV screen to the diagram on the schematic in
terms of approximately where we are in comparing.

A. Okay.

Q. So we talked a bit about Exhibit 32 and what you saw.

And could you just point out where on the schematic that would be.

A. Okay. Again, this photo appears to be taken from the parkway area,
which would be right here. It's taken in a westerly direction.

And what you're looking at here is the front gate, that's here, and
these steps going up right here.

Q. Okay. Go to Exhibit 91, please.

A. 91 is a close-up, much closer than the previous photograph. And
again, you're looking at the same area. It's the steps right in front.
And that's one of the victims lying there.

The gate here is open; it's -- the gate is wide open. That's basically
it.

(The instrument herein referred to as Close-up photo of the crime
scene and body of victim Nicole Brown Simpson, was marked Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 91 for identification.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Go to Exhibit -- excuse me. The other victim was
found where, if you could point at it?

A. The other victim was found off to the right, here. It's behind a
metal rung fence, behind that fence and off to the right.

Q. Exhibit 38, please.

Is that the area you were just pointing to?

A. Yes, that's the second victim.

This photo is looking down in a north by northwesterly direction. And
it is right in this area here, adjacent and just to the north of the
walkway and these steps going up, right in this area.

(Indicating to schematic.)

Q. Exhibit 43, please.

(Exhibit 43 displayed.)

A. That's a photograph looking directly down on the front steps. That
photograph depicts these three steps here.

And to the right of the photograph, at the foot of the steps, you see
one of the victims.

Looking directly down at this photo, directionally north would be to
the top of the photograph.

Q. Put on Exhibit 45, please.

A. Exhibit 45 depicts what turned out to be bloody shoe prints.

This is the walkway above the steps, back up in this area. And this is
to -- the top of this photograph would be west. The walkway is going
this way towards the alley, up towards the top.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photo of steps and walkway with
bloody shoe prints, was marked Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 45 for
identification.)

Q. In other words, that's right at the top of the steps that we saw in
the previous photo?

A. Yeah. The steps are down in this area here.

And again, this is up in here.

(Indicating to schematic.)

Q. And the steps on the 875 south Bundy board, if you could, point to
those that we're talking about.

A. Here are the steps right here.

(Indicating to schematic.)

A. We're looking in this photograph. We're looking up in this area
here.

Q. If you went over to the picture on the 875 Bundy board, it's --

A. Below here. Below these two. Back down in this area. It's up over
here above the steps.

(Indicating to photos.)

Q. We can go to Exhibit 47, please.

(Exhibit 47 is displayed.)

(The instrument herein described as perspective photo of walkway with
bloody shoe print, was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 47.)

A. This is more of an overall of the walkway. It's looking west
towards the alley.

Again, we see what appears to be bloody shoe prints leading west in
the alley. West is towards the top of the photograph. These three
steps depicted in this photograph, you see, right here. The front door
is just off to the left, we see here.

Of course, here's the corner of the condominium.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) If we can -- if we can go to 1781, please.

(The instrument herein described as a photo of walkway, marked for
identification as Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 1781.)

A. (Continuing) This is another.

Q. Is this a continuation of the walkway, walking back?

A. Yeah. This is going back. This is just off to the left. Here is the
front door -- front entrance of the condominium, which is here, barely
visible here in the lower left corner of this photograph.

But you're looking back in this direction. This is a metal gate here,
that is right before the stairs going down. That little gate would be
right here. And you're looking, again, in a westerly direction towards
the alley.

And just this portion is just beyond the front door looking west.

Q. Exhibit 54, please.

(54 is displayed.)

(The instrument herein described as a photo of a descending stairway
with a bloody shoe print, was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 54.)

Q. So you're walking along flat, and then you come to some steps?

A. Yeah, there's a stairwell going down. What you see here. And that
would be right here on the schematic, down towards the flat area, off
to the left with what would appear to be a guest room here.
(Indicating.)

A. And this is the stairwell on the schematic going down that -- you
see it here. And this is in a westerly direction towards the rear
alley.

Q. If we can back up for a moment to 1781, that -- the one we have. Do
you still see footprints?

A. Yes. They're beginning to fade. But there are remnants of what
appear to be bloody shoe prints going in a westerly direction.

Q. Exhibit 54, please.

(Exhibit 54 is displayed.)

A. Here you can see, also, remnants of these bloody shoe prints going
down the stairwell.

Q. Exhibit 55.

(Exhibit 55 is displayed.)

A. Appears to be another shot of that stairwell with the -- again, the
bloody shoe prints; partial bloody shoe prints. They're beginning to
fade at this point.

Q. Exhibit 1782.

(Exhibit 1782 is displayed.)

(The instrument herein described as a photo of the Bundy walkway was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 1782.)

A. This is looking directly down into this flat area here at the
bottom of the stairwell.

(Indicating to schematic)

Q. And each photo was continuing back in a westerly direction?

A. That's correct.

Q. Exhibit that's within a 2051?

(The instrument herein described as ascending stairwell, towards the
rear gate was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
2051.)

A. This is also looking west. This is the stairwell going up towards
the rear gate, west and then the schematic that would be right here.
And again this is looking out through the rear gate to the alley
westerly.

Q. And Exhibit 2044, please?

(The instrument herein described as parking area in rear of Bundy
scene was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2044.)

A. This is a rear of the location, say parking area adjacent to the
alley which is depicted at the top here.

This parking area is shown as the driveway in the schematic at the top
here.

This photo was taken from the rear of the walkway, roughly in this
area. From in front of the rear gate, which is here, but roughly from
this area, looking west.

Q. And Exhibit 125?

(The instrument herein described as a photo of rear of Bundy with jeep
and Ferrari was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
125.)

A. This is the rear of Nicole Brown's vehicle. The way it was found
that night.

This photograph is looking from the alley up here, back the other way,
east. Off to the left of the photograph, you see the rear gate that's
open here. And here's the walkway we've been describing to the left of
the vehicle.

Q. Have you now walked us through photos that start at the front and
go all the way through and behind the rear gate of the residence?

A. Yes.

Q. I've now placed on the board, Exhibit 87, title: "The front portion
of 875 south Bundy."

Could you first describe for us, if you could, the schematic and tell
us what that is then I'll take you through the various photographs.

A. Okay. Here's the schematic in the center of this display. It
depicts the two victims; Mr. Goldman, Ms. Brown.

Here's the front gate area. Here's the steps leading up.

We have bloody shoe prints depicted on the steps leading up. This is
the walkway in this direction, leading west.

We have various dimensions here.

In regard to the victims, this is a dirt area that meets with the
walkway right here.

We have, from the top of Ms. Brown's head, to the dirt areas, is 15
inches, as an example.

Mr. Goldman's left boot is eight inches from this walkway. We have a
tree stump that's depicted in here, which is one foot, 11 inches; some
23 inches from this retain wall.

It's a 14 inch distance from the inside of the lower rung on this
northerly fence to the lower back area of Mr. Goldman.

And then, of course, we have the photographs that have been marked
with the various items on the schematic, if you want me to get into
that.

Q. Let's take, if we could, the photo the furthest to the right as I'm
looking at it, which is Exhibit 88. Yes, sir.

(The instrument herein described as a photo of victim, Ron Goldman,
was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 88.)

A. Yes.

Q. I'll wait for that.

(Indicating to view screen)

A. That's Mr. Goldman. That photograph is taken, looking in a north by
north-westerly direction. And it shows Mr. Goldman in the position
that I first observed him here in this dirt area.

Q. We're also, as a convenience, putting the Exhibit up on the TV
screen at the same time.

If we can, move to the photo to the left of it, which is Exhibit 84,
and describe what that is and tie it into the schematic above, if you
will.

A. That's a close-up photo of a brown -- dark brown leather glove and
a dark blue knit ski cap. And if you follow into the schematic, that
was located in this area right here; the foot of Mr. Goldman's right,
where the dirt area meets with the walkway.

You also see a partial bloody shoe print in that general area. But
that's right here.

Q. That's Exhibit 89, incidentally.

Did you ever find more than, or see more than one glove at the 875
south Bundy?

A. No.

MR. BAKER: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No.

MR. BAKER: Vague. Ambiguous as to when. It's vague, ambiguous as to
the foundation, if he ever searched.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) We'll go one picture to the left.

(Indicating to Exhibit 91.)

A. Again, that's the front of the location looking west on the walkway
with the victim, Brown. And you see that depicted right here in this
particular area of the schematic.

Q. The exhibit you were just looking at and pointing at was Exhibit
91.

Let me move up one to Exhibit 49?

(The instrument herein described as a photo of the bloody shoe print
was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 49.)

A. 49 is a close-up of what appears to be a bloody shoe print. Looking
at this, I believe the west -- the top would be to the west. And if
you go all the way over to the schematic, you'll see where that's
located here on the walkway.

Q. Does that schematic purport to show all of the shoe prints that you
observed on the walkway?

A. No.

Q. If we go up one photo, the top photo on the left, that's Exhibit
69. What is that?

(The instrument herein described as a photo of a red spot with card
No. 112 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 69.)

A. 69 is a blood droplet located -- that was located at the northeast
corner of the condominium with a slight trailing to the west. Right
here. And you see that depicted here in this schematic.

(Counsel displays Exhibit 69.)

Q. I've put up on the board, 2058, victims' bodies in relationship to
each other.

And the two pictures are magnetized. You can move them around if you
want. And I ask you to do that so that the picture approximates what
you saw when you were at 875 south Bundy, early morning hours of June
13?

A. Actually, it's pretty close now if you line these up. I would say
that's pretty close the way it is.

Q. Okay. Would you describe for us -- we'll go to the picture at the
top, which is Exhibit 38. And could you describe for us, the body
where it's lying in relationship to any stumps that are there or other
terrain?

A. What you have is a photograph looking down on Mr. Goldman. It's
shot in generally northerly, northwest direction. Mr. Goldman is
lying, more or less, on his right side and he's lying over a stump of
a tree approximately eight inches in diameter on his right side. His
head is, more or less, in a westerly direction at the foot of a large
tree in this area.

His feet extend out in a south by southeasterly direction.

The clothing was disheveled, as you see it here.

Q. Anything else about the body that you observed?

A. Well, there was a great deal of blood on the left leg. There was a
great deal of blood every where. There was other vegetation in this
area. The parking here is very course.

And I believe there's a little plant, a little vegetation here in the
center of the photo. There's a metal pole to the rear. I believe this
is it here. No, I believe it was over here and I think this is a
support for a young sapling tree or something.

Q. If we can go to Exhibit 43, which is the bottom photo.

(Exhibit 43 is displayed.)

A. This is a photograph looking straight down at Nicole Brown at the
foot of the steps. And, again these, of course, these two photos
together show the relationship, the overall relationship between the
two bodies.

I earlier gave you some distances. One was -- like -- as an example,
from the top of her head to the line here was 15 inches.

Actually -- could possibly bring this down a little bit here. Now,
that I look at it, yeah. Yeah. I'm more comfortable with this.

Q. Now, about how far, then, would the top of Ms. Brown's head be from
Mr. Goldman's left toe?

A. Well, I measured 15 inches. I believe it's 15. Yes.

You see here the schematic from the top of her head. This isn't to the
tenth of an inch. It's just about 15 inches in from the top of her
head to the dirt area. And again, it's another eight inches from that
area to the bottom of the left boot of Mr. Goldman.

So if you were going to go in a straight line here, you'd have just
shy of two feet; 23 inches.

Q. And from Mr. Goldman's -- trying to get a sense of how close it was
from his forehead to Ms. Brown's head?

A. Well, if you have that here, it was -- I believe you're talking
from her head here.

Q. Yeah.

A. And going this direction to his --

Q. Yes, sir.

A. I have notes somewhere. I'm guessing it was maybe about 48 inches,
46 inches; something like that.

Q. Now --

A. Actually four feet.

Q. In terms of the area where Mr. Goldman was found, you mentioned
some stumps. What's to the left of the stump? This appears to be tree
or --

A. Well, it's a tree, a large tree. And actually, when you take a
closer look, it's all one tree through but there are like three trunks
that are interwoven that have grown together.

This is vegetation coming out of the bottom of it.

Earlier, when I spoke of a stump -- You can't see it. It was beneath
Mr. Goldman, beneath his right side. But this is all kinds of like one
tree. But it's like three, three stumps in one.

Q. Going what direction over to the towards the steps?

A. Over toward the steps.

(Mr. Medvene indicates.)

Q. Going --

A. Yes. You have it on here. It's just shy of two feet. One feet, 11
inches from this trunk to the retain wall adjacent to the steps.
That's less than two feet.

But again, this is -- there's three stumps. You can see two of them
here.

Q. Now using the tree as a cutoff, what are the approximate dimensions
of the cage area that Mr. Goldman was found in?

A. Approximate dimensions, I have -- it would be approximately six
feet here. Actually, I believe it's a little smaller when you get down
here because the rungs I believe were two inches in diameter.

So this is approximately five feet, eight inches from this walkway to
this metal rung fence. And going the other way, I've got four feet,
two inches approximately from that tree, from the forward stump of the
tree to the east metal rung fence so you've got roughly six by --
little over four feet.

Q. Could you just, if you wouldn't mind, mark off for us, maybe in
this area, what six by four is?

In other words, the area where you found Mr. Goldman, just give us an
idea of exactly how small that area is?

A. Well, I'd say perhaps between the wall here and the witness stand
something like this.

(Indicating to witness stand.)

A. Maybe if you went -- this is just an approximation?

Q. Yes.

A. Maybe if you went from the corner back to maybe midway here. I
don't know. Back about here. Just about like this, roughly four by
six. It's not a big area.

(Indicating to witness stand and back wall, behind witness stand.)

Q. Was there just what appear to be -- do I understand you correctly,
one set of bloody shoe prints between the two bodies?

A. There was what appeared to be the same bloody shoe print, partial
bloody shoe prints. Again, you can see some depicted here between the
two bodies.

This heel print appears to face this way or the toe would be facing
that way. And this one this way. But there did appear to be just that
one type of design.

Q. I'm going to put another series of photos on having to do with this
area and ask if you could describe what these photos depict, and if
they depict what you saw early morning hours of June 13.

Exhibit 138, please.

(Exhibit 138 is displayed.)

(The instrument herein described as a photo of bottom of Goldman's
shoe with officer in background, was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 138.)

Q. I'm going to put this on the TV monitor. What's on the TV monitor
is Exhibit 138?

A. 13 is the bottom sole, heel portion of the left foot of Mr.
Goldman's boot.

This was taken to accentuate a blood droplet that we were interested
in on the boot. And this was taken at the scene.

Q. Exhibit 24.

(Exhibit 24 is displayed.)

Q. Let me go back to 138 for a minute.

That blood droplet you subsequently determined was who's blood?

A. That blood droplet contained a mixture of both victims.

MR. BAKER: Objection. Foundation, Your Honor; That he determined
anything about that blood droplet.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (By Mr. Medvene) Let's go to Exhibit 24. What is Exhibit 24?

A. Looks like a pager there was a pager -- I haven't seen this in a
while, recovered from the scene. That pager was located -- in fact,
you can see it right here in this photograph, below the north rung
gate.

Q. In back of Mr. Goldman's body?

A. Yes. We subsequently determined that he had been caring that pager.

Q. Going to place before you what's been marked 124 and ask you what
that is?

A. 124 exhibits -- you only you want me to go to 78 first or --

Q. Let's go with Exhibit 131 first, which is this one?

(The instrument herein described as the Bundy knit cap was marked for
identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 131.)

A. Okay. Appears to be a dark blue knit cap and a brown paper bag.
Appears to be the same one that I saw at the crime scene, but I can't
say because of its condition. So, appears to be the same type.

(Indicating to bag.)

A. 77 is a left handed dark brown leather glove also with a paper bag.
The sticker on it says that it is an Exhibit.

THE COURT: That's a wrong exhibit number.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) The one you're looking at is Exhibit 12.

A. I'm referring to the number on here when I said 77. I don't know
which Exhibit you have.

Q. I understand. That's 129.

A. Okay.

(The instrument herein described as the Bundy glove was marked for
identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 129.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) What is it again?

A. It's a left-handed, dark brown -- appears to be a leather glove,
with a green sticker.

Appears to be the same type of glove I observed at the scene. I can't
-- again, I have not seen it in awhile.

Q. You observed it where?

Can you point out on the schematic?

(Witness indicates to photos.)

A. Glove is right in this area here. You can see part of it.

The knit cap is right here in this area. Here. Close to the -- close
to one another.

Q. Did anyone ever report seeing more than one glove at the scene?

A. No.

MR. BAKER: Objection. Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: Exhibit 717.

(Exhibit 717 is displayed.)

(The instrument herein described as photographs of Bundy Crime Scene,
Nos. 41, 93, 112 and 213 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 717.)

A. This photograph is looking down on one of the victims, Nicole
Brown, in the same position that we found her. As you can see over
here in this photograph, over to the right here would be to the north.

Q. Next picture, please. Also 717.

A. This is Mr. Goldman's photograph taken to the north. The north is
up to the top of the photograph.

Q. All right. I'm going to move away from the crime scene pictures
now. We're going to put on a number of shoe print pictures and ask if
these accurately represent what you saw June 13.

Exhibit 43 please?

(Exhibit 43 is displayed.)

A. Yes. That's the front steps again with Nicole Brown to the right.
It does in fact appear to be what I saw that morning.

Q. Could you point out -- I'm going to go through a series just to
show the various shoe print photos, and could you just point out
generally -- I'm just interested in the shoe prints?

A. I believe you have a partial right here.

Q. By right here. We're looking at what steps?

A. The lower left quadrant of the photograph, on the second step going
up.

Q. Okay. See any other shoe prints in that photo?

A. No. I'd have to take a good look here. There may be some partials
down in here. Appears to be in the lower left-hand corner. A possible
one here.

Q. Okay. Let's go to 44, please.

Exhibit 44 is displayed)

(The instrument herein described as a photo close-up of step and shoe
print was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 44.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Again, do you see any shoe prints?

A. Yes, on this step. This is the -- would it be one, two -- the third
step up. There appears to be three. One here. One here. And I don't
know if this is or not. I don't believe it is, but these two here.

Q. Okay. 45. And what I'll ask you, just on each is, do you see any
shoe prints, just to give the jurors an idea of the walkway as we walk
back?

(Exhibit 45 is displayed.)

A. Yes. Shoe prints appears to be bloody shoe prints here, here and
here.

Q. 46.

(Exhibit 46 is displayed.)

A. This is an overall -- again, appears to be down in here. Here in
this area, here, here, here going back.

Q. 47.

Exhibit 47 is displayed)

A. Again, going west in this area here, here.

Q. 48.

(Exhibit 48 is displayed.) (The instrument herein described as a photo
of bloody shoe print was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 49.)

A. That's a close-up.

Q. 49.

(Exhibit 49 is displayed.)

A. That's another close-up of the overall peripheral of one of the
bloody shoe prints.

Q. 50.

(The instrument herein described as a photo of bloody shoe print was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 50.)

A. It's a pretty good heel print there, that you see here.

Q. 51.

(The instrument herein described as photo of bloody shoe print was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 51.)

A. That close-up gives you a pretty good idea of the dimension of the
size of the shoe.

Q. 52.

(The instrument herein described as a photo of bloody shoe print was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 52.)

A. Another close-up, where you can see the heel here and the front
area to the left.

Q. 53.

(The instrument herein described as a photo of a bloody shoe print was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 53.)

A. Another close-up on the walkway. The heel is to the right, lower
right.

Q. 54.

(Exhibit 54 is displayed.)

A. The rear stairwell, you can see here there's partial bloody shoe
prints going down the steps and beginning to fade.

Q. 55. Exhibit 55 is displayed.)

A. Little earlier shot, you can see here these partials going down the
stairs.

Q. 56.

(The instrument herein described as a photo of shoe print on step was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 56.)

A. Is a bit of a close-up, also of another one on the walkway.

THE COURT: You're going to hit the juror.

MR. MEDVENE: I'm sorry.

(Indicating to blow-up.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Place before you what's been marked Exhibit 67
entitled blood drops at Bundy June 13, 1994.

And like you to orient us, orient the ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, if you would, with this schematic.

And then take us through what blood drops were found from the front to
the back.

And we'll go first to Exhibit --

(The instrument herein described as a photo of Bundy blood trail was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 67.)

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object, Your Honor, as to what he found.

THE COURT: No foundation whether or not he saw --

Q. We'll go through each one and you can tell us whether or not you
saw them.

MR. BAKER: Well --

MR. MEDVENE: We'll start.

MR. BAKER: The other way.

THE COURT: Excuse me. Overruled. You may proceed.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Exhibit 69 is the drawing at the bottom right that
has the 112. Exhibit 68 is next to us.

Could you please tell us whether those two photos accurately depict
what you saw June 13, 1994?

A. They do. (The instrument herein described as a photo of the walkway
at the crime scene was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 68.)

Q. Could you explain to us, first, what Exhibit 68 is?

What is the inside picture?

A. 112.

Q. Right next to 112.

(Indicating to sticker 112.)

A. This photograph, an overall -- the walkway looking west. What you
see are 112, which is a blood drop at the -- At the northeast corner
of the condominium with that little identification card and you see --
I believe it's 113.

Q. We'll deal with 113 in a minute. But staying with 112, where is 112
on the walkway?

A. 112 on the walkway is right here at the corner of the building if
you look at the schematic.

This is the overall schematic. This is east. This is west, the alley
way. North is up, south is down.

112 is the first blood drop I observed. That again was at the corner
of the condominium on the walkway.

Q. It's picture 69 which is in the corner -- a close-up of a blood
drop on 68 which is right next to it?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. If we can go up to what's been marked 70, which has the 113
tag on it and ask -- and tell us what that is.

(The instrument herein described as a photo of a red spot with #113
was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 70.)

A. 113 is more or less a close-up of another blood drop.

The second blood drop that appears on the schematic here, in the
walkway, it's a location right here.

Q. And can you tell us whether or not that picture accurately depicts
what you saw June 13, 1994?

A. It does.

Q. Let's go to the bottom row of pictures. The center picture which is
yes, sir which is Exhibit 71.

Can you describe what that is and what was found on that set of
stairs.

(The instrument herein described as a photo of stairwell at the scene
with open wrought iron gate was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 71.)

A. Yeah. There's a stairwell. There was another blood droplet that
occurred in this series. Located in this area as you look at the
overall photograph.

And of course, you see a close-up of that here in 114.

Q. And where is that blood drop on the path, if you can relate it to
the schematic?

A. The schematic is right here, as you can see, on the stairwell about
midway going down.

Q. And is 114, the drawing that has 114 on it, which is -- which is
Exhibit 72.

(The instrument herein described as a photo of a red spot with tag No.
114 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 72.)

Q. That a close-up of what you just pointed out on the stairs?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, if we can go to the top of the board to the picture that has
115 on it. That's Exhibit 74.

And could you tell us, I'd like you to look at that picture and the
picture next to it, which is 73.

(The instrument herein described as a photo of stairwell with open
wrought iron gate was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit
No. 73.)

(The instrument herein described as a photo of red spot with tag No.
115 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 74.)

Q. The staircase, yes. And tell us if you saw that scene on June 13,
1994?

A. Yes, I did. That's the fourth in this series of blood drops
depicted on the schematic in this location.

Q. When you say this location, can you just spell out for the record?

A. On the walkway at Bundy, it's inside and east of the rear gate.
Approximately the center of the walkway.

The overall of that -- you see it on the left here. And that blood
drop would be located right where that little black card is, right
where this little card is right here.

Q. In relationship to the gate, where is it?

A. Well, it's right east of and in front of the gate, middle of the
walkway. Here's your gate. Here's your rear gate right here.

Q. Um-hum?

A. Here's the blood drop right in front of it. Again, if you go down
to the schematic, here's the rear gate right here. That's where that
blood drop is, right here.

Q. We've covered four blood drops. Where was there another blood drop?

A. That was a fifth blood drop.

Q. If you would go to the two pictures on the left-hand side of the
photo as you look at it. The middle picture that has a 246 on it is
Exhibit 75. And the picture that has a 117 is 76.

And could you tell us what those pictures depict?

A. Sure. The top, one, 75, is an overall of that fifth drop of blood,
which was located on the driveway adjacent to the alley, behind the
location.

And then the bottom photo here is a close-up of that same blood
droplet. And again, that's back here on the driveway that's adjacent
to this alley.

Q. Can you tell us whether or not these pictures accurately depict
what you saw on June 13, 1994?

A. They do.

Q. So all total, there were how many blood drops down the pathway and
into the alley?

A. Four on the walkway and one in the alley, for a total of five.

Q. All right, sir. You can resume your seat for a minute.

THE COURT: Let's take a ten-minute recess.

Ladies and gentlemen, don't talk about the case. Don't form or express
any opinions.

(Recess.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: We are experiencing a possible medical problem with one of
our jurors, so we'll adjourn until 1:30.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

THE COURT: Thank you.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA THURSDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1996 1:35 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: We're proceeding at this time. The jury panel is not in the
courtroom. Counsel have had the every opportunity to speak with the
hospital and with Juror No. 367, one of the alternates.

He, at the time I spoke with him, was still at the hospital, under the
doctor's care. The Court is satisfied that he is suffering from
considerable stress, and he has asked the Court to be relieved from
further service on this case.

Counsel want to add anything?

MR. BAKER: No.

THE COURT: At this time, then, the Court is going to relive Juror No.
367.

Bring the jury in, please.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: The jury has returned to the courtroom.

Ladies and gentlemen, one of your number, as you know has had to be
taken to the hospital. I spoke with him on the phone and he's resting
comfortably.

He asked to be excused, and the Court did excuse him from further
service on this case.

I'm also advised that some of you have experienced yesterday, those of
you who had to return to work, considerable pressure exerted upon you
from your co-workers and people at your workplace. Is that generally
what has been occurring?

JURORS: (Nod affirmatively)

JUROR 295: Yes.

THE COURT: For the duration of this trial, ladies and gentlemen, you
are to be considering yourself to be serving as a juror every day,
even on the days that we are dark. You are ordered not to return to
court on these days, and the jury clerk is ordered to continue paying
you your large salary of $5 a day as jurors, even on those days that
we don't actually have you sitting in the courtroom.

Okay. I think one of you jurors have indicated on your hardship
questionnaire that you were concerned about the pressures that may
arise from this case.

I am equally concerned with your well-being; so if you -- any of you
are feeling any particular stress or anxiety that you think is
affecting your health, please don't hesitate to let me know, all
right? Everyone understand.

JURORS: Yes.

THE COURT: Everybody okay so far?

JURORS: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

JUROR 265: Thank you.

THE CLERK: You are still under oath.

And would you please state your name again for the record.

THE WITNESS: Tom Lange.

THOMAS LANGE, the witness on the stand at the time of adjournment,
having been previously duly sworn, resumed the stand and testified
further as follows:

THE CLERK: Okay.

DIRECT EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Did you have occasion during your initial tour with Detective
Phillips to walk to the rear of the 875 South Bundy property?

A. Yes.

Q. Would you be good enough to show us, Detective Lange, or excuse me,
Mr. Lange, how you walked to the property.

Haven't I put up Exhibit 18?

A. This is when I initially got there the first time?

(Exhibit 18 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yeah.

A. This being Bundy here, I went from the front on Bundy, down to
Dorothy. We walked to the west on Dorothy, to the alley behind the
location. We went up the alley and entered the -- entered the
residence through the garage, off the alley.

Q. Okay. Sir.

Now, when you -- did there come a time when you arrived at the rear of
the residence?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Detective Phillips point out to you the rear gate of the
residence?

A. Yes.

Q. Did he make any reference to anything on the rear gate?

A. Yes.

Q. What do you recall seeing on the rear gate on June 13?

A. A reference to, and what I observed, to what I believed to be blood
on the rear gate. On the top portion, there appeared to be what might
be considered a transfer of some type of a smear, and then I believe I
saw two, what appeared to be blood droplets, on the lower inner rung
of that gate.

Q. Is there any question in your mind that what you saw on June 13
appeared to be blood?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Leading, suggestive, argumentative.

THE COURT: I'll sustain that. The witness testified he saw what
appeared to be blood.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you have occasion to visit the Bundy location
on July 3, 1994?

A. Yes.

Q. And what were the circumstances of that visit?

A. On July 3, 94, I was requested to do a walk-through with the
District Attorney's office, with the prosecutors on the case.

As a consequence, I met them at that location, and we entered through
the rear gate to do a walk-through.

Q. As a result of that walk-through, did you give certain
instructions?

A. Yes.

Q. And what were those instructions?

A. I requested a criminalist, Mr. Fung, to meet us back at the Bundy
location.

I also requested that a photographer respond to the location.

Q. Why did you give those instructions?

A. I arrived at the rear gate; I observed what appeared to be, perhaps
initially, the same blood transfer that I saw back on the 13th of
June.

I also saw --

MR. BAKER: Move to strike as speculative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I also observed, once inside the gate, the two drops that I believe
I saw on the 13th of June, giving rise to the speculation of the
possibility that that blood had not been collected.

As a consequence, we contacted the criminalist and a photographer and
had them respond back to Bundy to check that out.

MR. BAKER: Can I have that answer reread?

THE COURT: You may.

(Record read by the reporter.)

THE COURT: Is it giving rise to speculation?

MR. BAKER: Yes, Your Honor. Move to strike.

THE COURT: Correct the record.

(Motion to strike denied.)

MR. MEDVENE: I've put up on the board what's been marked as Exhibit
80, which purports to show certain pictures taken June 13, and under
that, certain pictures taken July 3.

(Exhibit 80 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Were you present, Mr. Lange, when the July 3
pictures were taken?

A. Yes.

Q. And what do the July 3 pictures purport to do?

A. They purport to show the blood that I observed on the rear gate on
July 3, the same blood I observed on the 13th.

Q. Are you talking about the bottom-rung pictures?

A. Yes, the lower, where it says July 3, the lower six.

Would you like me to approach?

Q. Yes.

A. These six photos, the lower six, pertain to July 3, what I
observed, and was these two blood drops.

In my mind, these were the same two blood drops that I observed on the
13th.

MR. BAKER: I object. This is nonresponsive to the question.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. MEDVENE: And you can resume your chair.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You're talking about blood drops 115 and 116?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, let me ask you: With respect to the picture on the board, June
13, does the picture or pictures taken on June 13 -- Strike that.
Could you tell me what are the three pictures at the top of the board
under June 13?

A. The upper left, you have an overall shot of the rear gate, shot in
a westerly direction toward the alley.

The second photo over, you have more of a close-up of the rear gate,
taken in that same general direction.

The third shot is a blowup of the second shot.

So these are essentially the same photographs. This is a blowup of
this. (Indicating)

Q. The one on the far right is a blowup of the one in the middle?

A. That's correct.

Q. Do the pictures taken on June 13 show all the blood that you recall
seeing on June 13?

A. No.

Q. And how do you explain that?

MR. BAKER: Object, Your Honor. There's no foundation for that. Calls
for speculation on the part of this witness.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: These photographs were not taken to highlight blood on
the rear gate. When we do that, they're overall photos to orient the
blood or whatever the item is. And that is a close-up to identify what
that item is being collected.

These June 13 photographs were not taken to highlight any blood on the
rear gate.

Q. Can you compare them to the ones taken on July 3 and tell me the
difference, in light of what you just said, between the ones taken
June 13 and the ones taken July 3?

A. The difference from what?

Q. In the photographs being taken specifically to highlight the blood
or not to highlight the blood.

A. Sure.

As I pointed out, whether it's blood or whatever, the item that's
being collected, generally there's first an overall orientation shot
taken of the overall area. In this case, the gate.

There's a close-up shot taken for the specific item; in this case, the
two blood drops. There can be closer shots, such as this.

Generally, you'll have a ruler there.

And this will be taken during the process of actually collecting a
piece of evidence.

Again, this is orientation farther away; the close-up is your
identification.

Q. And the photos you were pointing to as giving an example of the
close-up shots, were those the middle photo on the second row and the
third photo on the second row, or . . .

A. Yes, these two. These are the close-ups, or the identification-type
photos.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, the witness is pointing to what's
been marked as Exhibit 82. The middle photo is 83, which is the photo
on the right.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) When you finished the initial walk-through with
Detective Phillips, approximately what time was it?

A. It had to be approximately 4:45 a.m., perhaps a little later, right
in that area.

Q. What then occurred?

A. I went back out through the rear of the location, back down the
alley, back over to Dorothy, into the front of the location, where I
met with my partner, Detective Vannatter.

Lieutenant Rodgers was also there, and I believe Phillips and Fuhrman.

At that point, we discussed what to do with what we had. I made a
decision, along with my partner, to take Phillips and Fuhrman and
proceed to Mr. Simpson's residence, for a number of reasons.

Q. What were those reasons?

A. We wanted to meet Mr. Simpson.

MR. BAKER: I object, Your Honor. The reasons that this witness had,
not that we want to --

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: We felt that -- and I felt or we --

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object again. Anything that uses the word "we"
calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: We felt that Mr. Simpson, down the road, would be an
integral part of this investigation, because he was either, at this
point, in our minds, divorced or separated from one of the victims.

It wasn't clear at this point which it was.

We had two minor children who had been transported to the police
station under very traumatic circumstances. We wanted to meet this
individual.

We felt that there's certainly a possibility that he could be of
assistance down the road in perhaps identifying the killers, giving us
background information on the victim.

Certainly caring for his children.

I requested that Phillips and Fuhrman accompany us.

Phillips told me that Fuhrman --

MR. BAKER: Objection to what Phillips said as hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

THE WITNESS: -- requested that they go with us.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And what was your purpose in having Detectives
Phillips and Fuhrman go with you and Detective Vannatter?

A. Number 1, they knew the area. They knew how to get there. It was
still dark; I was unfamiliar with that area; Vannatter was not
familiar with that area.

More importantly, we wanted someone to stay with Mr. Simpson after we
met him, to see to his needs, to assist him in getting his children
back, to perhaps conduct some type of preliminary interview.

I figured that perhaps there would be a another very traumatic
situation with him. We wanted someone to stay with him.

Vannatter and I were to return to the crime scene and conduct the
investigation.

I had been told that Mr. Simpson only lived a couple of miles away, so
I had intended to be back in 10, perhaps 15, 20 minutes, at the
outset.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, let me move you in time several days ahead,
and ask if there came a time when a decision was made to charge Mr.
Simpson with murder and to arrest him?

A. Okay.

Q. Was such a decision made?

A. Yes.

Q. And had arrangements been made for Mr. Simpson to surrender himself
at Parker Center at a particular time in the morning hours of June the
17th?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Do you know whether Mr. Simpson was to surrender
himself at the Parker Center in the morning hours of June 17?

MR. BAKER: Foundation.

THE COURT: You can answer yes or no.

MR. BAKER: It's vague as to time when he knew.

THE COURT: Assume it was before it occurred.

THE WITNESS: That was my understanding.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did Mr. Simpson surrender at Parker Center on June
17?

A. No.

Q. Did you receive information that Mr. Simpson was out at Mr.
Kardashian's house?

MR. BAKER: Objection. That's hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did the police, to your knowledge, attempt --
strike that.

After Mr. Simpson did not surrender at Parker Center, did the police,
to your knowledge attempt to arrest him at Mr. Kardashian's house?

MR. BAKER: Foundation again, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained as to form.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Were you the commander in charge of the
investigation of the double murders, Detective Lange?

A. I was one of the two lead investigators, yes.

Q. Were orders given by you or Detective Vannatter, to your knowledge,
that officers should go to Mr. Kardashian's house to arrest Mr.
Simpson?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, the objection as to what orders he gave --

THE COURT: You may ask whether he gave an order.

MR. BAKER: He asked more than that, but I have no objection to that
question.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you participate in the giving of any orders
for officers to go to Mr. Kardashian's house and arrest Mr. Simpson?

A. I did not give those orders, no.

Q. Were those orders given, to your knowledge?

MR. BAKER: Objection. That calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Do you have any information whether officers went
to Mr. Kardashian's house?

MR. BAKER: Hearsay.

THE COURT: You can answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did they go to Mr. Kardashian's house?

MR. BAKER: Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained to that.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) What information do you have as to whether or not
officers went to Mr. Kardashian's house?

A. I received information that they had responded to his home that
afternoon.

Q. Was Mr. Simpson there?

A. No.

MR. BAKER: That's all hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Later in the day, was Mr. Simpson located?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I must object.

MR. MEDVENE: Where --

MR. BAKER: Just a minute, Mr. Medvene.

There's no foundation.

THE COURT: I've sustained all these objections, Mr. Baker. But if it
means we're going to have to go for the extent of calling four, five
officers to show someone went to the Simpson house, that someone
detained Mr. Simpson at some point or other. I thought this was an
effort to save time. But if it's that important to you, I'll sustain
the objections, and we'll just jump through the hoops.

MR. BAKER: I object to the Court's comments. I'm entitled to make
objections that I feel are appropriate for my client.

THE COURT: That's exactly what I said.

MR. BAKER: I don't appreciate the Court's comment. I would appreciate
that -- that I'm entitled to make objections, and I ought to be able
to do it without the Court making comments relative to my objections.

THE COURT: I made the comments. I'll stick by them.

Go ahead.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Was Mr. Simpson, to your knowledge, located later
in the day?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: He may answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Where was Mr. Simpson located, to your knowledge?

A. Initially, he was located -- I believe it was northbound on the 405
Freeway in Orange County.

Q. Did there come a time later on June 17, after the time he was
located, when Mr. Simpson was apprehended and arrested?

A. Yes.

Q. At the time he was arrested, were any possessions taken from him?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: Object. There's no foundation for this, Your Honor, unless
he was there.

THE COURT: Sustained. Answer stricken.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) To your knowledge -- Strike that.

Was Mr. Simpson's car -- Strike that.

Was the vehicle Mr. Simpson was traveling in impounded at the time of
his arrest?

A. Yes.

Q. As part of the impounding of the car, were certain items taken?

A. Yes.

Q. What items?

A. There was a .357 revolver; there was a black leather traveling bag,
containing several items; there was a cellular phone; I believe there
was a green towel involved.

Basically, I think that's it.

Q. Was the traveling bag impounded?

A. Yes. I testified to a black leather, what I call a travel bag.

Q. What -- did you examine the items that were in the traveling bag?

A. Yes.

Q. What items were in the traveling bag?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object, Your Honor. That's asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

If he looked at the travel bag, you may inquire.

If you're just asking him to state what somebody else found,
sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I'm asking him: Did you look in the travel bag?

A. Subsequently, yes.

Q. What did you find?

A. I found what appeared to be changes of underwear; there were
numerous credit cards, and what I would term private club
membership-type cards.

There was an NFL Pro Football Hall of Fame ring; there was what I
would term a goatee and mustache disguise kit, with a receipt.

There was a passport in the name of Mr. Simpson.

I believe that was it. There might have been some other smaller items,
socks.

Q. Any --

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object and move to strike if -- it's leading
and suggestive, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: There were keys. I believe there was some kind of address
book or identifier or something, but there were keys; there were two
or three sets of keys, couple of pen knives -- at least one pen knife
on one of the key rings. And again, there were many other items. I
just -- I don't recall specifically at this time what they were.

MR. MEDVENE: Can you put up 690, please.

(Exhibit 690 is displayed)

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph of items contained in
Mr.~Simpson's travel bag at the time he was arrested, was marked for
identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 690.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) We have on the board, Exhibit 690.

Have you seen what that picture portrays when you examined Mr.
Simpson's bag?

A. Yes, that appears to be the what I would term a disguise kit or
disguise mustache and goatee that I observed.

MR. MEDVENE: Would you put up 689, please.

(Exhibit 689 displayed.)

(The instrument herein referred to as Mr. Simpson's Passport was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 689.)

Q. MR. MEDVENE: Can you tell us whether or not that passport was the
one you were referring to?

A. Appears to be the one, yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Would you put up 676, please.

(The instrument herein referred to as A .357 magnum revolver was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 676.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Do you recognize that?

A. That appears to be the .357 revolver that I alluded to earlier.

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. Put that back.

Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Do you recognize what has "item 64" next to it,
which is, I believe, Exhibit -- which is Exhibit 677?

A. Yes. Six .357 rounds of ammunition taken from the cylinder of the
revolver.

(The instrument herein referred to as Six .357 rounds of ammunition
taken from the cylinder of the revolver marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit
676, was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 677.)

MR. MEDVENE: Would you put up 699, please.

(Exhibit 699 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Recognize that?

A. Yes. That's the two keys with the -- appeared to be some type of --
perhaps a child's ring, what I term a Smokey the Bear ring; it had
Smokey the Bear insignia on it. These two keys were attached.

(The instrument herein referred to as Smokey the Bear key ring with
two keys attached was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit
No. 699.)

MR. MEDVENE: Put up 698, please.

(Exhibit 698 displayed.)

THE WITNESS: Also appears to be one of the key rings with pen knife.
And I believe that's a Bentley insignia there on the key ring.

(The instrument herein referred to as key ring with Bentley insignia,
containing pen knife was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 698.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Were those items found in the bag?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you determine whether the keys on Exhibit 699 found in Mr.
Simpson's bag fit the lock to Nicole Brown's condominium?

MR. BAKER: I want to approach on this.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. BAKER: These keys, when they say they fit the condominium, there's
no foundation for this question, and they know it, because the keys
had been changed by the time they got through all the -- the locks had
been changed, keys.

THE COURT: Just a minute. What is your foundation?

MR. MEDVENE: The foundation is this, sir: Detective Lange determined
that Nicole Brown had given a key to her friend, Cora Fischman; that
with that key, he had a lock made; that the keys found in Mr.
Simpson's bag opened the lock that was made from -- from that key, and
that there was --

THE COURT: Say that again.

MR. MEDVENE: Okay.

THE COURT: From the beginning.

MR. MEDVENE: Okay.

Detective Lange made a determination --

THE COURT: Wait a minute. I don't like that word.

MR. MEDVENE: All right. Nicole Brown had given the key to her
condominium to Cora Fischman.

THE COURT: He's going to testify to that.

MR. MEDVENE: We can put that in through Detective Lange, that he
received a key from Cora Fischman, that he took that key and had a
lock made; that that key worked; that he then took the keys found --
that Mr. Simpson had, and those keys worked that lock.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, the problem is --

THE COURT: Wait. I'm trying to digest this. Who's going to testify
that Nicole Simpson gave the key to Cora Fischman?

MR. MEDVENE: Cora Fischman can testify to that.

THE COURT: Is she available?

MR. BAKER: Sure.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. MEDVENE: I'm saying she will. It's in her deposition.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. PETROCELLI: I believe it's in her deposition. I can have that
checked out.

MR. MEDVENE: That she supplied the key; Detective Lange took the key,
because before the 17th, the lock was changed, so Detective Lange took
the key that Cora Fischman says Nicole Brown gave to her and had a
lock made; that the key worked that lock.

They then took two of the keys they found in Mr. Simpson's bag, and
they both worked the lock. And that lock was the lock for the front
gate and the front door.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, also Barry Scheck's house key fit that lock. If
they're going to put it on, I want the lock here and I want the full
foundation, because this is a sham, and that's why it wasn't used in
the first trial. And for them to say that it only would fit that key
is a quantum leap and isn't what happened.

MR. PETROCELLI: We're not saying only but it fit the lock.

MR. BAKER: Everybody -- when they made that demonstration, everybody
who had a key that looks like this Schlage key, it fit. So I object to
this, and require them to -- request the Court to require them to go
point by point through this.

It is a quantum leap to get the jury to believe that only the key that
was in Mr. Simpson's bag would fit that lock.

MR. MEDVENE: We don't think we have the obligation to say only -- what
we're showing is Mr. Simpson had two keys in his bag that fit the lock
to Nicole Brown's house; that's all we're saying.

MR. BAKER: If that were the case, this is not the lock of Nicole
Brown's house; it's a lock they had made. Now they have to put on the
foundation for that.

THE COURT: Do we have a locksmith?

MR. BAKER: Yeah, put him on.

MR. PETROCELLI: The locksmith Lange used to make the lock from Cora's
key.

MR. LEONARD: I think he's on the --

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. LEONARD: I think there was.

MR. KELLY: Think there was a locksmith.

MR. KELLY: There was a locksmith, like a locksmith that changed the
locks at Detective Lange's department with respect to creating the
original, that lock.

THE COURT: You may examine, subject --

MR. BAKER: Judge -- Judge, this is foundation.

THE COURT: If they're going to bring the locksmith --

MR. BAKER: No, no, no.

THE COURT: It doesn't make any difference --

MR. BAKER: It makes a lot of difference, because it gives an
implication to this jury that Mr. Simpson had a key that fit the lock.

I want them to put it on in the proper order. You keep telling me to
put things on in the proper order.

THE COURT: You want what?

MR. BAKER: That this --

THE COURT: You're --

MR. BAKER: All right.

They say it fit; this key goes into this lock, and this is Nicole
Brown's lock.

It isn't Nicole Brown's lock; it is a lock they made. Have them put it
in here, the locksmith. They can take the key that's in evidence and
demonstrate that. This is such a great deal; put it right in the lock
and say, this key fits this lock.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BAKER: And do that. They don't need it if this is just trying to
get out of him what he's not -- doesn't have any personal knowledge
and everything he -- if everything he did is viewed and all his
testimony is hearsay, and let him do it the right way.

MR. MEDVENE: He did it all himself and watched it.

THE COURT: Did what?

MR. MEDVENE: He got the key from Cora Fischman. He caused the lock to
be made from that key, and he then tried the keys found in Mr.
Simpson's bag in that lock, ascertaining that those keys opened that
lock.

If Mr. Baker wants to put on testimony --

THE COURT: Where is the locksmith?

MR. MEDVENE: We can try to find a locksmith, Your Honor. We can.

THE COURT: I don't think I'm going to let this evidence come in
without a locksmith.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can we have the witness who the locksmith is? I think
it's a locksmith that worked under his direction.

MR. BAKER: They can ask anything they want. They take this with all
the --

THE COURT: Well ask him.

MR. MEDVENE: We'll ask him what he knows of the locksmith, if the
locksmith worked under his supervision or not.

MR. BAKER: Judge, you can build a lock every key will fit.

MR. PETROCELLI: I think it was done directly under his supervision.

MR. BAKER: I don't care. The work that was done --

THE COURT: What does this witness know about locks?

MR. PETROCELLI: He was in the investigation.

MR. MEDVENE: To determine whether or not Mr. Simpson had a key to get
into the house.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker is articulating an objection that I see. The
objection is this: The objection is that how can this witness testify
that this locksmith made a lock that fit the particular key that works
Nicole's gate?

MS. BLUESTEIN: Can I add one fact that I just verified the deposition
of Cora Fischman. Cora Fischman describes a key that belonged to,
quote, "anyone." She had specific knowledge that Nicole Brown Simpson
--

THE COURT: Then, fine. Then she will testify.

MR. BAKER: That's what she would testify.

THE COURT: Same objection to this witness?

MR. MEDVENE: We can do it that way.

May we first ask this witness if he observed the locksmith? If he
didn't, we understand where we have to go.

If he did -- if he did observe the locksmith make the lock from the
key and he then took that lock and tried the key, it seems to me, he
has as much personal knowledge.

THE COURT: Who was the lock -- where was it changed?

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Brown changed the locks around June 15, 16, 17.
Right after Nicole's death, he changed the locks.

THE COURT: Nobody checked the key at this time?

MR. MEDVENE: Not before he changed the locks.

MR. PETROCELLI: The police didn't know he was doing it. He did it on
his own. Mr. Brown did it on his own.

All he had were these keys to her house; they didn't have the locks.
So they had the locksmith --

THE COURT: My suggestion is, you bring the locksmith in.

MR. MEDVENE: May I ask Your Honor if the --

THE COURT: If the locksmith testifies it's same key that Cora Fischman
had, fine. You can argue the logical conclusion from that.

MR. MEDVENE: I don't want to violate the order.

May I ask him one question, which is: Was he present when the
locksmith did whatever he did. If he wasn't, that will be the last
question.

THE COURT: What difference did it make?

MR. MEDVENE: If he observed the locksmith make the lock and he
physically took the lock, then the foundation is, he has personal
knowledge if he's physically there when the locksmith is making the
lock.

THE COURT: I want him to testify that --

MR. MEDVENE: I don't know if he was.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MR. MEDVENE: I don't know if he was there when the locksmith made the
lock.

THE COURT: Why don't you know?

MR. MEDVENE: Well, because we thought we could put this in, but we'll
ask him if he was there. We think -- we think we can proceed.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, you know how you have those little locks on the
bathroom door that you can stick any stick into, any pen or anything
else, and you can pop them open? Or you can put the key that comes --
that we put on the nail above and lock our kids out of there. You can
make a lock so that you can open it with any key in the world.

That's what they did. That's what the point is, you don't have to --
you don't have to know that. The point is that if that -- that's the
foundation that they need to put on before they ask him any questions
about the lock, that this lock only fits that.

THE COURT: I think he can lay some foundation.

MR. PETROCELLI: Lay a little more foundation.

THE COURT: Not with this witness.

MR. PETROCELLI: What the locksmith is going to say is that he got a
key from Detective Lange.

THE COURT: We have to hear the locksmith say that.

MR. PETROCELLI: The locksmith didn't go to Cora Fischman and get a
key; he got a key from Detective Lange and made a lock to fit that
key. That was the extent of his participation.

THE COURT: Fine; he can testify whether it's one of those locks that
--

MR. MEDVENE: That anybody can open?

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

MR. MEDVENE: I guess we should just ask Detective Lange if he gave a
key to a locksmith, so we have that part of foundation.

THE COURT: You can do that.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Detective Lange, do you know, based on your
investigation, whether the locks to Nicole Brown's house were changed
sometime after the murder?

A. That's correct.

Q. The key that you obtained from Cora Fischman, who did you give that
key to?

A. A locksmith for the City of Los Angeles.

Q. And what did the locksmith do?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object, Your Honor. This is obviously in
violation of what we just talked about.

THE COURT: Sustained

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you give the locksmith any direction?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I object to this. The Court's made its rulings
and he's well outside the Court's rulings.

THE COURT: Sustained

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did the locksmith for the City of Los Angeles do
any work with the key in your presence?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I object, and I object to Mr. Petrocelli
whispering to him in front of the alternate jurors, right within a
foot of them.

THE COURT: You have to go all the way to your side of the desk.

MR. BAKER: He can write him a note, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You can answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. May I have the question again?

MR. MEDVENE: Yes.

THE COURT: Ms. Reporter.

(The reporter read the record as follows:) "Q. Did the locksmith for
the City of Los Angeles dm any work with the key in your presence?"

THE WITNESS: No.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did the locksmith subsequently give something to
you?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, outside the Court or the -- I object.

THE COURT: Overruled. You can answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: Not to me personally, no.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did he give something to anyone, to your
knowledge?

MR. BAKER: Well --

THE COURT: Sustained

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Do you have any personal information of what the
locksmith gave to someone?

MR. BAKER: In view of the last answer, that question is totally out of
order. I object.

THE COURT: If that's an objection, that's sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: We'll recall the witness, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You certainly may.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you very much, Detective Lange.

THE COURT: Ten-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen.

(Recess.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, we believe we have, as the
plaintiffs have the right to play Mr. Simpson's statement when we
choose to in the plaintiffs' case.

That playing of Mr. Simpson's statement, which I understand is the
contention of the defense at this stage, is clearly outside the direct
examination.

The witness didn't testify at all about even being at Parker Center.
It's an attempt to put the statement on before plaintiff attempts to
put it on. It's clearly outside the scope of the direct examination
and in a significant part, it's also hearsay.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, under -- as I'm sure the Court is aware, he has
been designated as an expert under evidence code section 721 as well
as under the case of Smith v. Brown Forman Distillers, 196 Cal.App.3d,
503, and the case of Noll v. Department of Motor Vehicles, 274
Cal.App.2d, 281.

We have the right to cross-examine this witness on the entire
transaction, and the entire transaction.

They have taken this gentleman from -- with some significant gaps that
we intend to close. But they have taken this gentleman from the date
of June 13, to and including the 17th.

And we intend to fill in the gaps and to cross-examine him about his
involvement. They've got him as one of the two lead co-detectives and
I think we have the right to pursue a full and complete
cross-examination under the aforementioned cases, as well as Evidence
Code Section 721, and I believe 651.

THE COURT: With regards to the tapes, the defense precluded to finish
cross examination as to the tapes. That part was not covered in direct
examination of this witness.

MR. BAKER: I would suggest as an expert as number one; number two, as
the co-investigator, which was brought out by Mr. Medvene.

He interrogated Mr. Simpson and we'd certainly like to interrogate him
about those tapes and his involvement in that.

THE COURT: That's my -- that's my ruling.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were resumed in the presence of the jury:)

THE COURT: Juror No. 186, as to your request, it's not a problem with
the Court. The Court's direction to the jury not to go to work was
only for protection of the jurors. And for this particular instance of
training, you may.

JUROR NO. 186: Thanks.

THE COURT: Defense may cross-examine.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Lange.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. Now, Mr. Lange, when we took your deposition in June of 1996, you
had met with the plaintiffs' attorneys nine times after the acquittal,
going over the facts of this case, right?

A. I don't recall the number of times.

Q. How many times have you met with the plaintiffs' attorneys
subsequent to your deposition to prepare for your testimony and your
presentation that took place today?

A. I believe possibly approximately three times.

Q. Three times after your June 1995 -- 1996 deposition?

A. Yes.

Q. You had about five hours you'd spent with them before June of '96.
How much -- many hours you have spent with them since?

A. I would say probably a dozen. Perhaps in excess of a dozen hours,
maybe closer to 14.

Q. So total of about 20 hours that you've put in, since the acquittal
of Mr. Simpson, in preparing for your presentation that went on this
morning and this afternoon, right?

A. I suppose that's possible, yes.

Q. Now, as any of that time, sir, were you paid by the city of Los
Angeles for the assistance you were giving the plaintiffs' attorneys
in this case?

MR. MEDVENE: Relevance, materiality, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Goes to bias, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Were you paid by the plaintiffs' attorneys for the
15 to 20 hours that you assisted them in the -- in helping them to be
able to present their case today?

A. No.

Q. And do you consider yourself to be friends of the Goldmans?

A. Certainly good acquaintance and I would like to think friends.

Q. And do you think that your -- Strike that. Did you go to your
partner, Phil Vannatter's retirement party?

A. I did, yes.

Q. Were the Goldman's there?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. Did they go to your retirement party?

A. Yes, they did.

Q. And so you were all at -- both the Goldman -- both the Phil
Vannatter, the Tom Lange retirement party, the Goldmans were invited
guests of each of you?

A. That is correct.

Q. All right. And did you go to any other event with the Goldmans?

A. I don't recall going to any other event with the Goldmans.

Q. How about the Otis Marlow, Paul Tippin retirement party; were they
there?

A. I don't believe.

Q. So Otis Marlow and Paul Tippin were LAPD officers that worked on
the case, the Simpson case, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained. Unless you're going to connect it up.

MR. BAKER: I'll connect it up.

THE COURT: Okay.

THE WITNESS: They were part of it early on. I believe they were
involved in a couple of --

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, I think Your Honor sustained the objection.
I'm not sure.

THE COURT: He says he's going to connect it up. I'll strike it if he
doesn't connect it up.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you know that after the acquittal of Mr.
Simpson, Otis Marlow and Paul Tippin went to work for the firm
representing the plaintiffs, your friends, the Goldmans, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality. Outside the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I don't know if that was -- I don't believe they were
involved in it at that -- the time that they retired. I think it was
sometime after that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Mr. Lange, you know that Ottis Marlow and Paul
Tippin came to LAPD while you were still an LAPD officer and got
information to assist the plaintiffs after the acquitting of a O.J.
Simpson, do you not?

A. Yes. They came to the department, certainly.

Q. You also know that you were responsible for giving 10,197 pages of
documents to the plaintiffs' attorneys, the employers of your friends
on the police force, Paul Tippin and Ottis Marlow, and not one page to
the defense, true?

A. No. I couldn't answer that in that vein. If you allow me to
explain, I will do that.

MR. BAKER: Deposition page 80, please.

THE COURT: Mr. `Baker.

MR. PETROCELLI: One second, Mr. Baker.

THE COURT: They want to load up, too.

MR. BAKER: I'll give you some additional time. I'm going to come back
to it in two seconds.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Thank you.

MR. BAKER: You gave all of the audio tapes, all of the videotapes from
the criminal trial to the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, did you
not?

THE WITNESS: With the proviso that they were going to all four
entities in this case.

I couldn't honestly say it just went to one group. There was an
arrangement made by then city attorney, Mary House, to use these
attorneys to disseminate all of this information to the various
entities involved.

There's a letter of agreement; that was my understanding. So they did,
in fact, send a copy of it to Parker Center. Those items were copied
off, and it was my information that they were going to disseminate to
all four entities.

Q. And in all of these 20 hours, Mr. Lange, and all these nine
meetings you had before your deposition, you never asked them if they
followed through with the agreement and gave one page of one document
to the lawyers for Mr. Simpson, did you?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Well, you may ask that question in a nonargumentative way.

THE WITNESS: I didn't see that as my -- as my duty or my job to see
that this was done for the other attorneys.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You gave the document -- Strike that. Otis Marlow
and Paul Tippin were friends of yours on the LAPD, right?

A. I considered them friends, yes.

Q. And you went to their retirement parties, right?

A. I did.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you knew that both of these investigating
officers were working for the plaintiffs, and you gave them documents,
taped -- audio and videotapes, didn't you?

A. They were representing the attorneys who were supposed to get all
of that information, as advised to me by the city attorney's office.

Q. And?

A. I had no choice but to turn it over to them.

Q. I see. It just so happened that they were -- you were -- they were
-- you were pals. You gave it to them as a coincidence?

A. No.

MR. MEDVENE: Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained. Jury's to disregard that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you have appeared, as I understand it, on Larry
King Live, Rivera Live, Charles Grodin, Dateline, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Anything I missed?

A. I believe there were probably a couple more, yes.

Q. And it was to tell your story about the criminal case, right?

A. To some extent, yes.

Q. And by the way, are you -- are you now -- did you get the book deal
you were looking for?

A. I hope to. I certainly hope to.

Q. And do you hope to put a chapter in the book deal on your testimony
in the civil case?

A. I don't believe so.

Q. You --

A. We'll see what happens.

Q. You have negotiated a book deal?

(Laughter.)

A. I have not signed a contract, but I am in the process of putting a
book together.

Q. All right.

And you testified at the preliminary hearing, right?

A. I did.

Q. Testified at the grand jury hearing?

A. That's correct.

Q. Testified in the criminal trial?

A. Yes.

Q. And let's start with your arrival at the crime scene at 4:25, okay?

That's about when you got there on the 13th?

A. That's correct.

Q. And after you got there on the 13th, you took a cursory tour of the
crime scene; would that be accurate?

A. That's your terminology. Perhaps a cursory tour. We took a
walk-through, a preliminary walk-through.

Q. And after you take your preliminary walk-through --

By the way, did you find anything of significance inside the house
that you thought was significant?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance. Outside the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Significant in regards to the killings?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In regards to a double homicide. You were there to
investigate.

A. Not necessarily. There were some items of interest in the home that
were noted. I did not find anything that I directly connected to the
homicide.

There was a knife that I observed that I was initially interested in,
that I had examined.

Outside of that, no.

Q. Okay. Would you agree, Mr. Lange, that the time of death is of
critical importance in investigating a homicide?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, he's been designated as an expert and he has
testified as an expert here today.

THE COURT: Didn't testify as to time of death in his expertise.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you noted on your walk-through, a cup of ice
cream on the bannister, did you not?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope and not relevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WTINESS: There was a cup on the bannister in the lower level by
the garage that was pointed out to me, that appeared to have melting
ice cream in it, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you told Ron Phillips to have the officer who
first observed the ice cream, document that in his report?

A. I may have mentioned that, yes.

Q. And was that important to you because that could be a clock that
could determine time of death?

MR. MEDVENE: Relevance and outside the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, did you -- did you see any Levis jacket in the
kitchen?

A. A Levis --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, outside the scope.

THE COURT: He may testify whether he saw it or not.

THE WITNESS: I don't recall seeing a Levis jacket.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you went through about 4:35, 4:40?

A. I walked through. I wasn't looking at anything in particular. We
were just walking through, en route to the front walkway.

Q. Well, you certainly saw a knife and requested the knife to be
photographed, did you not?

A. The knife was pointed out to me.

Q. You didn't see it without -- I'm sorry -- I apologize. Go ahead.

A. I did request that, but not at 4:25.

Q. You wouldn't have seen the knife but for it being pointed out to
you; is that your testimony, sir?

A. I would assume that I would, in fact, see the knife, but that's not
how I understood your question.

As we did the initial walking through, Detective Phillips pointed the
knife out to me as we walked by it on our way to the front door.

Q. Now, you say you went out through the kitchen, through the dining
room, and out the front door of the condominium, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, by the way, can you -- to your recollection, you have gone
through there many times, have you not?

I mean, you went through there two times on the night of the 13th; you
were there on July 3; and you were over there between the 13th and the
3rd; true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Vague, ambiguous. Going through what, Your
Honor, the inside of the house or the outside of the scene?

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You went through the condominium at least twice on
the 13th. You went through the condominium again on July 3. You went
through the condominium again on August 26. And I believe you went
through the condominium at least twice between the 13th of June and
the 3rd of July. Would that be accurate, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No, I can't say that. I don't recall entering the
condominium on July 3. I haven't seen any documentation in some time
on that.

And I don't know that we entered between the 13th of June and the 3rd
of July, either.

I qualify that, and I may be mistaken. If I could see some
documentation.

Q. You testified earlier, did you not, that you went over on July 3 to
take the district attorney through a walk-through?

A. That's correct.

Q. Is it now your testimony that you didn't walk through the
condominium?

A. I --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. That's argumentative. "Is it now your
testimony," implies his testimony is different. All he said was he
went outside.

MR. BAKER: I think that we would object to the speaking objection of
Mr. Medvene.

THE COURT: Okay. Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I don't recall testifying to walking through the
condominium. I recall testifying to a walk-through on the outside.

Again, I would like to qualify that. We may have gone in; I just don't
we recall it. There would be documentation, hopefully.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Do you know if you can see the kitchen from the
front door of that condominium?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: From the outside?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) No, standing outside, with the front door open.

A. That's what I meant, from the outside.

Q. Fair enough.

A. See the kitchen?

Q. Yeah.

A. I don't believe so.

Q. So you couldn't see the telephone or anyone on the telephone from
the outside of the front door into the kitchen, correct?

A. I couldn't.

Q. Yeah.

A. Well, I don't believe -- if the door was closed, I don't believe
anyone could.

Q. Well, with it open?

A. I believe if you look, you can see, perhaps, the entryway, the east
side of the kitchen, by looking from an open door, perhaps, but not
directly into the kitchen.

Q. Okay. Now, after you walked through the condominium the first time
on July 13, as I understand it, you walked in through the entrance in
the garage to the condominium and out the front door and out to the
ledge to where you could see the victims, correct?

A. No; it was June 13.

Q. I apologize.

A. And we went up the stairs and walked directly through to the front
door, not to the front walkway.

Q. And then after you were out the front walkway, you then walked back
on the walkway on the north side of the house, correct?

A. Initially, we went to the right, down towards where the bodies
were, and stood on the ledge that overlooked the bodies.

At that point, Detective Phillips attempted to point out various
things to me. We turned around, went back down the walk, and went west
after that.

Q. And is that the time that you noted the bloody foot prints or was
it after you returned from Rockingham that you noted and documented
the bloody footprint?

A. The shoe prints I noted immediately there. They were pointed out to
me as soon as I walked through the front door by Detective Phillips.

Q. Now, this morning you talked about footprints going in a westward
direction. Do you recall that?

A. Shoe prints, yes.

Q. Shoe prints, pardon me.

How many -- well, was there a reason you couldn't indicate that they
were shoe prints going east?

You can answer that yes or no.

A. Yes.

Q. In the -- you described earlier, did you not, shoe prints going
east?

That is in your criminal testimony?

A. I think I described a heel mark that appeared to be pointing
towards the east that was down near the bodies, yes.

Q. And that's the shoe print on the step? If you can come over here.

(Indicating to board labeled front portion of 875 South Bundy.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Correct?

A. Yeah. These are shoe prints going west.

Q. This shoe print is going west?

A. No. Generally the trail is going west.

Q. Okay. This shoe print is going east?

(Indicating to schematic.)

A. Whoever put this on here does, in fact, have it pointing east.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) There was another shoe print up the walkway that
wasn't going west, as well, true?

A. No. I believe there was an area back up in here where it appears
the person was turned around, such as I'm doing here. And then they
went back the other way and headed west.

Q. You can resume the stand.

It was your testimony that whoever perpetrated these crimes, turned
around and walked east, true?

A. I don't believe that was the testimony. I believe it was turned
around, made a -- some type of a turning movement back towards the
east.

Q. And got as far down as the step, correct?

A. No. I believe some turning movements -- those shoe prints are all
in the same area. I don't believe they walked east.

Q. So the one shoe print on the step is not a shoe print going east at
all, correct?

A. Well, it's depicted on there. It's going east.

I don't recall.

What I'm referring to is up closer to the entrance. This is what
you're looking at, is down on the step.

I'm referring to an area that's up closer to the entrance where there
are two or three shoe-print impressions that appear where the person
has turned, and it appears to be looking back towards the east is what
I'm referring to.

Q. So you can tell from a shoe print that a person is turning and
looking back towards the east?

A. All I can do is go by the heel marks and the toe marks. I suppose
it's possible a person could have his shoes on backwards. But I don't
think that happened in this case.

Q. Well, are you telling us, Mr. Lange, that the shoe prints went east
or that they faced south?

A. The ones up farther.

Q. Yes.

A. I'm not telling you in either direction. I'm telling you that they
appeared to turn as if someone were looking back towards the east.

Q. All right. Now, when -- strike that.

Your testimony is that whoever perpetrated these crimes, turned around
and did not walk east at all. Is that true or untrue?

A. Again, my recollection is that the person --

Q. I'm not asking --

MR. MEDVENE: If court please --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) -- I'm asking what you're testimony is.

MR. MEDVENE: If court please, he should have a turn to answer Mr.
Baker's question.

THE COURT: This witness is not responding to the question. The witness
is ordered to respond to the question.

THE WITNESS: I would request the question again. Perhaps I
misunderstood you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) My question, sir, is: Is it your testimony that the
perpetrator of these crimes walked west, turned around and did not
walk back into the back east?

A. That's what the interpretation -- I saw that the shoe prints lead
-- yes, that's correct.

Q. Shoe prints. As far as you were concerned, the perpetrator walked
up towards the west, turned, faced the east and then turned and went
back west. Is that your testimony?

A. That's what the shoe prints would indicate.

Q. That's -- so that is your testimony?

A. That's what I saw, yes.

Q. That's what -- and that's what you determined on the night of June
13, 193 -- 1994, correct?

A. That's what I observed.

Q. All right. Fair enough. Now, you, on the night of the 13th, after
you had made the walk-through of the area, you then, as you testified,
went back out to the front of Bundy and had a discussion, correct?

A. Actually, it was in the morning of the 13th, yes.

Q. All right. You talked to Phillips, Fuhrman and Vannatter, right?

A. I believe it was Phillips, Vannatter and Rodgers.

Q. Fuhrman wasn't there?

A. He was there, but I don't recall having a discussion with him.

Q. And at that point in time, how many officers were at the scene;
officers, detectives, plain clothes, anybody who was a law enforcement
official, how many?

A. I have to consult the log. There were possibly -- I'll give you an
estimate, I suppose.

Q. 20?

A. That's probably a pretty close estimate.

Q. Now, the bodies had been discovered and it was told to you that the
bodies were discovered shortly after midnight, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And so it is now at the time that you are having this discussion
outside of 875 south Bundy, close to 5:00 A.M. in the morning,
correct?

A. That's going on 5:00 A.M., perhaps quarter of.

Q. And you were aware at 5:00 A.M. in the morning that nobody had
commenced processing the crime scene, true?

A. Not entirely. I was aware that certain photographs had been taken,
certain orientation photographs.

Q. No criminalist picked up or collected any evidence at this time,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you hadn't called for any criminalist to come to the crime
scene at 875 south Bundy, had you?

A. I had not.

Q. You hadn't called for a coroner, for the L.A. County coroner to
come to the crime scene?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance. Materiality.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So, at the time when there was no criminalist doing
the investigation and you and the other lead detective, Vannatter and
the relieved lead detectives were having this discussion, there was
basically no processing of the crime scene going on some five hours
after the LAPD had been notified of the double homicide, true?

A. Well, again, not entirely because there was some photography that
had been done. There were people locating evidence. There were
discussions ongoing, these types of things. There was always going to
be some delay when we have this transaction when one division is going
to take the case from another.

So this happens.

Q. So, knowing that you'd had a photographer out there that had been
called and knowing that you were co-lead detective, you and Mr.
Vannatter decided to go to 360 north Rockingham to try to establish
some rapport with Mr. Simpson, correct?

A. Certainly seems like the reasonable thing to do, yes.

Q. Yeah. While you have a wealth of evidence at 875 south Bundy, two
bodies, glove, hat, blood drops; it seemed like a good idea to leave
that crime scene and go attempt to establish some rapport with Mr.
Simpson, right?

A. Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Question argumentative. Move to strike.

THE COURT: It's stricken. Jurors to disregard that.

MR. BAKER: And --

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MR. MEDVENE: We would ask Mr. Baker not continue to do that.

THE COURT: Not only does Mr. Baker interrupt me, you interrupt me.

MR. MEDVENE: Sorry.

THE COURT: I was making a ruling.

MR. BAKER: Now --

THE COURT: Excuse me. I didn't finish.

Objection sustained. Jury's to disregard the question and the answer.
That is being argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, at the time that you decided to go to 360 north
Rockingham to establish rapport with Mr. Simpson at 5:00 in the
morning, there was no detecting going on at 875 south Bundy, true?

A. Detecting?

Q. Yeah.

A. Would you clarify that for me, please?

Q. Do you know what detecting is?

A. Well, I can think of the perhaps three or four different
interpretations of that.

If you're referring to an on-going criminal investigation, well that
is part of that investigation.

And certainly the trip that you keep referring to as "to build a
rapport," was in fact, much more than that, and an integral part of
this investigation in its early stages.

MR. BAKER: Move to strike as nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Denied.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, it's true that the two relieved and the two new
lead detectives at the crime scene left 875 south Bundy at around 5
o'clock in the morning?

A. That's correct.

Q. And at that time, again, you had called for no criminalist. You had
not called for the coroner, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You then got in your automobiles and drove to
Rockingham, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you think that it would be a good time to try to engender
some rapport with Mr. Simpson after he was going to be told that his
ex-wife had just been murdered?

A. Again --

Q. You can answer my question.

A. Well, I'm trying to, sir.

Q. Well, you can answer it yes or no.

MR. MEDVENE: If court please, Mr. Baker should not interrupt the
witness. Your Honor, we ask that he be asked not to do that.

THE COURT: You may answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: May I have the question again, please?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you think it would be a good time to establish
rapport with Mr. Simpson immediately after he was going to be told
that his former wife had been murdered?

A. Not necessarily just for that purpose, no.

Q. And you knew that Detective Phillips was going to go to Rockingham
to tell Mr. Simpson that his former wife had been murdered; isn't that
true?

A. No.

Q. That wasn't part of the discussion that you all four had there?

A. No.

Q. And if Detective Phillips had said that, that would be incorrect?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

A. He didn't say it in my presence. He may have said it in the
presence of someone else, but I don't recall ever hearing that.

Q. Well, wasn't -- with all of you, the idea that Mr. Simpson was
going to be personally notified of the death of his former wife?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, Mr. Simpson was not, and you knew Mr. Simpson was not on July
-- June 13, 1994, the next of kin to Nicole Brown Simpson, did you
not?

A. I did not know whether or not he was divorced, as I testified to
earlier, or separated. I did tie the children, however, to Mr. Simpson
and that was the main concern. That was a main concern.

Q. So the main concern in the personal notification to Mr. Simpson was
not personal notification to Mr. Simpson, but to be worried about the
children, correct?

A. Well, as I've testified, there were two or three reasons.

Q. Correct.

MR. MEDVENE: Court --

THE COURT: You may answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: Sure.

In all due respect, there are some questions that cannot be answered
yes or no and this is one of them.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) How many times in the 30 years that you've been in
the Los Angeles police department, have you sat on the witness stand?

MR. MEDVENE: Court please, relevance. Materiality.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) How many hours have you been a witness on the
witness stand?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Do you know how to answer questions from the witness
stand, Mr. Lange?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Mr. Lange, I'll ask it again. I'll have the Court
reporter read it back with the court's permission.

THE COURT: You may.

(The reporter read back the question as follows:)

"Q. So the main concern in the personal notification to Mr. Simpson
was not personal notification to Mr. Simpson, but to be worried about
the children, correct?"

A. Certainly one of the reasons, yes.

Q. Did you have any discussion about personal notification to Mr.
Simpson when the four of you detectives were standing in front of 875
south Bundy?

A. Obviously the subject came up.

Q. It wasn't a big issue, correct. The issue was the kids?

A. The kids were a main issue. They were a main issue but there were
other things that we did consider.

Q. And the children of Mr. Simpson at the time you had this
discussion, you were well aware, were at west L.A. Police station,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, so the four of you leave 20 officers or so at 875 south Bundy
and get in your cars, two cars and drive to Rockingham, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Asked and answered several times.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Takes you about five, six minutes to get to
Rockingham.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Approximately.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) When you get to 875 south Bundy, or -- strike that.

You get to the Rockingham address of Mr. Simpson, both of the cars
stop and the four officers get out, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you thought it would take four of you to take care of the kids;
is that right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you think you needed four officers, sir, to
inform Mr. Simpson that his children were at West Los Angeles police
department?

A. For that express purpose alone, no. But that wasn't the only reason
we went over there.

Q. The other reason was to get this rapport with Mr. Simpson just
after he would be told that his former wife had been killed, right?

A. When I stated rapport, this was also to meet him, to know who he's
going to be dealing with in the future. He's going to be in shock.
He's going to have a lot of trauma in his life. We wanted to meet him,
yes.

Q. And it was important to meet him and leave the crime scene with the
wealth of evidence that was there unprocessed, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

THE WITNESS: Now, how long was it, Mr. Lange, before -- After you were
at 360 north Rockingham in -- And before you decided that someone was
going to go over the wall.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope. We didn't get into this
area at all.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: I'd like to be heard on that.

THE COURT: You may present when you call him as a witness.

MR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, I would love the Court to please look at
the --

MR. MEDVENE: If court, please --

MR. BAKER: -- The cases I cited.

THE COURT: I will sustain the objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You were one of the people who made the decision to
go over the wall, were you not?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Before you made the decision to go establish this
rapport with Mr. Simpson, you knew that there had been at least one
incident of domestic violence between Mr. Simpson and his former wife,
true?

A. No.

Q. So am I to understand that it's your testimony, Mr. Lange, that
when you, Detective Fuhrman, Detective Phillips, Detective Vannatter
were standing out in the street at 875 south Bundy and you had a
discussion concerning going to Rockingham, you had no discussion with
Mark Fuhrman about any prior domestic incident between Mr. and Mrs.
Simpson; correct or incorrect?

A. That's correct.

Q. Didn't say a word, right?

A. I had no discussions with Fuhrman at all. If you'd like me to
explain this, I certainly can.

Q. You didn't hear from Mark Fuhrman at all, one word about any
domestic incident at 360 north Rockingham, true?

A. I don't recall hearing anything about it, a domestic dispute, from
Fuhrman that morning.

Q. Don't recall Mark Fuhrman indicating that he knew the way to
Rockingham because he'd been there before?

A. I did hear that through Phillips.

He said that Fuhrman had indeed been there on a radio call in the
past, could possibly get us there.

Q. And is it your testimony that O.J. Simpson, on the morning of June
13, 1994, was not a suspect for the murder of his former wife?

A. He was not, what I would term, a probable cause suspect.

Q. I didn't ask you whether he was a probable cause suspect. I asked
you if he was a suspect by any definition?

A. We really didn't have enough information.

Q. You can answer it yes or no.

A. Well, I'm trying to qualify the answers, sir, and I'm trying to
give you an honest straight forward answer and that's to the best of
my ability.

Q. Can you answer my question and not give us what you want?

Well -- can you just answer my question?

Did you believe when the four of you got in the car, that O.J. Simpson
was a suspect for the murder of his former wife?

A. There were two cars. I did not consider him a suspect in the murder
of his wife.

Q. And did you have that as a possible, a probable or potential, none
of the above?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative, and it's also not relevant to
this case, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.

THE WITNESS: You can't start eliminating people before you receive
evidence. So --

MR. BAKER: Move to strike as nonresponsive. Request the Court reporter
to reread the question and have the Court order Mr. Lange to answer
it.

THE COURT: Answer it yes or no, or I don't know or whatever. But
answer the question.

THE WITNESS: May I have the question read again, please?

(The reporter read the question as follows:)

"Q. And did you have that as a possible, a probable, a potential, none
of the above?"

THE COURT: I don't know how you can answer that question.

MR. MEDVENE: Compound, vague, ambiguous.

THE COURT: Want to take another shot at that?

MR. BAKER: Be happy to.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You didn't believe, then, when you got in the car at
5 o'clock in the morning to go over to Mr. Simpson's house, that he
was a potential, or probable suspect at all, correct?

A. Once again, I can't eliminate people before I had evidence. He was
not a suspect in any mind at that time.

Q. Wasn't a potential, wasn't a probable, just wasn't a suspect even
though he was -- he was the former husband of the decedent, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative. It's vague. It's compound, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: I don't think so. Overruled. Anybody is a potential suspect
and you don't know until you get evidence, sir. You don't -- Or you
don't get evidence.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) He was a potential suspect when you went over there?

A. Everyone was a potential suspect. We had no evidence at that time
connecting anybody to this crime.

Q. Now, you heard Phil Vannatter testify in the preliminary hearing
relative to the fact that Mr. Simpson was not a suspect at all,
correct?

A. Well, actually I didn't because I was excused from the courtroom,
but I had heard the incident you're referring to.

Q. And he said that?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Excuse me. The question is
improper to read this. Someone else purported testimony and ask this
witness to comment on it, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did Phil Vannatter tell you that Mr. Simpson wasn't
even a potential suspect when you got in the car and headed for 360
north Rockingham on the 13th?

MR. MEDVENE: That calls for hearsay. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Received, ladies and gentlemen, only for the state of mind
of this witness and not Detective Vannatter's state of mind. You may
answer.

THE WITNESS: There was no discussion at all between Vannatter, myself
or anyone else regarding Mr. Simpson as a suspect that morning.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you ever tell anyone that the ex-husband is
always a suspect in a murder crime?

A. No.

Q. Never uttered those words ever?

A. I don't recall ever saying that, that's correct.

Q. In terms of -- in terms of Mr. Simpson not being a suspect in the
morning, in your mind, of the murder of his former wife, you wanted to
go over and first see about the children, and second, speak to him and
gain some rapport with him, right?

A. Basically, yes.

Q. And that was the sole purpose that the two lead detectives left the
scene at 875 south Bundy and traveled to 360 north Rockingham, true?

A. Well, that and leave Phillips and Fuhrman at the Simpson residence
if someone were there, yes.

Q. You wanted to leave the other two detectives there?

A. That's correct.

Q. Oh.

So, that was important for you to take them over there so you could
leave them there, right?

A. To stay with Mr. Simpson, or whoever else happened to be at that
location that might need their assistance and getting the children
back or anything else that might come up certainly.

Q. Now then, you came back at around 7'o'clock in the morning, right?

A. Yes. A little before 7:00.

Q. And again, there had been no criminalist called for Bundy by 7
o'clock when you returned, true?

A. No, I believe there was one in route and they were contacted and
rerouted to the Rockingham location.

Q. Why don't you tell us the first time the criminalist got to the 875
south Bundy crime scene after the LAPD was notified at 0010 in the
morning?

A. I think it was sometime after 10:00 A.M.

Q. So 10 hours after the bodies were discovered and reported the LAPD,
the criminalist got to the crime scene?

A. Approximately.

Q. Why don't you tell us, Mr. Lange, however how long it was after the
LAPD was notified of the death of two people before the coroner got to
the crime scene at 875 south Bundy?

A. Would have been coroner's investigator arrived about there
approximately 9:00 A.M.

Q. So nine hours?

A. Approximately.

Q. Now, after you got back from Rockingham and you spent about two
hours there, correct or an hour and a half?

A. I think I was there about an hour and 20 minutes, something like
that.

Q. After you got back, you then did an additional walk-through of the
Bundy condominium, correct?

A. No. I did several things.

Q. Okay. The no is responsive. One of the things that you did was go
to various areas of the crime scene and document your observations,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you did that, sir, in your own handwriting and you took
measurements and noted blood drops, et cetera, did you not?

A. To some degree. Not everything, but to some degree, I did that.

Q. Well, you documented the blood drops on the walkway, did you not?

A. To the extent that I noted them in the notes, yes.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, I was going take a break in about five minutes.
If you're going to get into a specific area, I'd like to break now.

MR. BAKER: Okay.

THE COURT: Take ten minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about
the case. Don't form or express any opinions.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Okay. You may resume.

THOMAS LANGE, the witness on the stand at the time of the recess,
having been previously duly sworn, was examined and testified further
as follows:

CROSS-EXAMINATION (Continued)

BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Now, Detective Lange, you wrote -- co-authored a murder follow-up
report, did you not?

A. I believe it was part of one. I'd have to see it to see what you
were referring to. There were several.

Q. You remember this was Exhibit 1061 to your deposition, and you were
questioned about it. That was in June of 1996.

We've got to mark it because I don't think it's been marked in this
case?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's a report that you co-authored, correct?

A. Actually, I'm the one who wrote it.

Q. You did write it?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Now, you indicated that you hadn't known of any domestic
violence before you went to Mr. Simpson's estate, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay. And you wrote on page 3, I thought -- 2. Sorry.

Tell me if I'm reading this right:

Upon arrival at the crime scene, detectives were met by Detective 3
Ron Phillips, a West Los Angeles Division homicide coordinator.

Phillips stated the victim Brown was the ex-wife of O.J. Simpson, the
well-known athlete/actor.

Additionally, Phillips stated that Mr. Simpson and victim 1 had been
embroiled in previous domestic violence litigation, one of them
resulting in the arrest of Mr. Simpson.

Mr. Simpson resided at 360 North Rockingham Place in Brentwood,
approximately two miles from the crime scene.

You then continue on: Detectives followed up to the Simpson residence
for the purpose of death notification and to check on Simpson's
welfare.

That's what you wrote in your murder follow-up report, is it not, sir?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And so you had knowledge before you went up to Simpson's residence
that, in fact, there had been a previous domestic abuse because you'd
been told that by Detective Phillips, correct?

A. No, no, that's not correct.

Q. Thank you very much, sir you've answered the question.

MR. MEDVENE: Court please?

THE WITNESS: I did. I said no. And I'll gave you an explanation, if
you'd like it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Let me ask you a couple more questions.

You then state in here that, I went up to the Simpson residence for
the purpose of death notification and to check on Simpson.

There's no mention whatsoever of any welfare of the children, is
there, sir?

A. I don't believe in that paragraph that there is, no.

Q. Now, in terms of your being at the crime scene at 875 South Bundy,
it was you, was it not, who requested somebody to get a blanket to
place over the body of Nicole Brown Simpson?

A. Actually, I requested a sheet.

Q. And you, being a veteran detective, knew that if you put something
over the body, that contamination can and does occur, correct?

A. Not necessarily, no.

Q. Well, you wanted to make every effort, did you not, Mr. Lange, to
ensure that there would be no contamination that would inhibit in any
way the finding of trace evidence, such as hair and fiber, true?

A. Contamination --

Q. True or untrue --

A. -- compromise?

Q. -- true or untrue.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, the witness should be able to answer
the question, Your Honor. It's only fair he be able to answer it.

THE COURT: You may answer that question.

Read that question back to the witness.

(The reporter read the record as follows:)

"Q. Well, you wanted to make every effort, did you not, Mr. Lange, to
ensure that there would be no contamination that would inhibit in any
way the finding of trace evidence, such as hair and fiber, true?"

THE WITNESS: Certainly.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So you directed some officer to get a sheet, not a
blanket?

A I originally said a sheet. I asked him for a sheet; that's correct.

Q. They said a blanket. That was Officer Thompson -- strike that.
Yeah. It was Officer Thompson?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. Yeah. If he said a blanket, he'd be mistaken?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. That's not what the testimony is.

THE COURT: Sustained. That was not what the testimony was.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) When Officer Thompson came to you with the blanket,
did you allow it to be placed over the body of Nicole Brown Simpson?

A. Yes. I sent him for a sheet; he returned with a blanket. He
couldn't find a clean sheet, so he returned with a clean blanket. That
was his explanation to me.

MR. BAKER: Move to strike as nonresponsive, Your Honor.

THE COURT: It may remain.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you allow the blanket to be placed over the body
of Nicole Brown Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you understand at the time that you'd be contaminating that
body with trace evidence from the blanket -- from the dryer -- where
it was washed and dried? Did you understand that when you had it
placed over the body?

A. Not necessarily.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. It's one, compound, and assumes
facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: Assumes facts not in evidence. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you have any understanding that you could take
hair and fiber from a dryer that the blanket would be dried in and
move that trace evidence onto the body?

A. Certainly that's always possible; however, I had another reason for
doing it.

Q. And that reason, in your view, overrode the possibility of
contaminating the crime scene?

A. Without any question.

Q. All right. Now, did you, in your conversations and meetings with
the plaintiffs' attorneys in this case, did you come to understand
that there were any topics that you were not to discuss on the witness
stand here today?

Did they tell you what they didn't want you to answer?

A. No.

Q. They didn't tell you there was any subject off limits?

A. I wasn't aware that I could discuss anything. I thought I was here
to answer questions; and no, there wasn't.

Q. Okay. So you had no such discussion, correct?

A. I don't recall anything like that.

Q. Fair enough. Now, Mr. Lange, you were at the crime scene after you
got back at about 6:45, and remained at the Bundy crime scene until
when?

A. I believe I was called away sometime after 12 o'clock. Sometime
after noon, I believe I was called away.

Q. And during that period of time, from 6:45 until sometime after
noon, is when you did your processing of the crime scene and
documentation of evidence, correct?

A. Most of it was done during that time, yes.

Q. And that would have been commencing seven hours after the bodies
were found and LAPD was notified, until approximately 12 hours after
the bodies were found and LAPD notified, right?

A. Commencing -- I'm sorry. Seven hours after they were found?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. Approximately.

Q. Now, when you -- strike that.

It is important, is it not, to first recognize evidence at a crime
scene and then document it? You would agree with that?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor; relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: What do you mean by "recognize?"

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Determine that something is, in fact, evidence, as
contrasted to something that may have no evidentiary value whatsoever.

A. Generally, that's true.

Q. And would you agree, sir, that one of the critical steps in
processing a crime scene is to document the evidence?

A. That's one of the steps.

Q. And you made crime-scene notes from the crime scene on June 13,
1994, true?

A. I did.

Q. And you were trying to put in these notes everything of
significance you observed?

A. Not necessarily.

Q. All right. Let me read your deposition.

Page 207, starting at line 13, through 22.

"Q. These notes were taken by you at the crime scene, correct?

"A. That's correct.

"Q. And they were taken more or less as you observed various things at
the crime scene; is that correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Were you trying to put in these notes everything of significance
that you observed?

"A. Yes."

Now, you made pretty detailed notes encompassing nine pages of
attempting to put in everything you observed, correct?

Well, actually, I think there were more than nine.

A. Well, nine --

Q. I apologize. June 13, 1994, that's when you made, I believe, nine
pages of notes.

A. There were nine or ten, yes.

Q. And in the nine or ten pages of notes, you documented all of the
blood drops that you have testified to this morning and early
afternoon, true?

A. Well, when you say "documented," I wrote them down, and they
weren't measured to any great degree. I noted them in the notes.

Q. And you talked about the blood drops out on the driveway, north of
the driver's door.

MR. BAKER: Why don't you flip that on, Phil.

MR. P. BAKER: The notes or --

MR. BAKER: Yeah, page 9 of his notes.

THE COURT: Is that an Exhibit?

MR. P. BAKER: No, not yet.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, it shouldn't be displayed at this
time. There's no question pending.

MR. BAKER: I'll be happy -- you can put it off -- I'll be happy to lay
a foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Mr. Lange, these are your notes, are they not?

A. Yes, a copy.

Q. Those are a copy and those are the notes we just talked about that
you wrote what you observed on June 13, first nine pages, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's in your handwriting?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And that's your documentation of the crime scene when you were
there on June 13?

A. Correct.

Q. And you tried to put in everything of significance that you
observed, correct?

A. Well, for the most part, yes, there are areas that I wouldn't
necessarily become overly concerned with because other people are, but
that's a general observation that I had, yes.

Q. So that when you stated in your deposition you wanted to put down
everything of significance you observed, you now believe only those
areas that you thought you were concerned with, as contrasted to areas
that other people might be concerned with, right?

A. Not necessarily. I think you're asking for a black-or-white answer
here.

Q. I'm asking for a truthful one.

A. That's exactly what I'm trying to give you.

Q. Now, let's put it --

MR. BAKER: What's the next number in order?

THE CLERK: 2107.

MR. BAKER: What Is it? I'm sorry.

THE CLERK: 2107.

MR. BAKER: Let's put up page 9, please.

(The instrument herein referred to as Notes of Mr. Lange was marked
for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2107.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, on page 9, you document two dimes, 2 pennies of
the driveway north of the jeep. Do you see that?

A. I do.

Q. You document a blood drop straight down on the driveway, north of
the driver's door of the jeep?

A. Yes.

Q. You documented additional blood drops on the walkway inside the
rear gate --

A. That is correct.

Q. -- and the north side of the residence?

And then you document blood droplets observed on the north walkway
between the shoe prints, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And those were -- blood was very important, wasn't it?

The blood drops were significant evidence, were they not?

A. To me, they were significant because they appeared to me to be the
blood of a suspect, yes.

Q. And then you diagramed and measured the gate, true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you did not indicate a single blood drop on the gate in your
notes that document the crime scene of June 13, 1994; you would agree
with that?

A. Yes. I saw no reason to do that at that time.

Q. I see. So that's the only blood drop that you omitted in your
observations of blood drops on June 13, 1994, right?

A. No. There were many blood drops that weren't documented. There were
many other -- there were fingerprints that weren't documented. This is
not 100 percent of everything I observed, by any means.

Q. Okay. Now, on June 13, 1994, you observed some blood droplets on
the back of the body of Nicole Brown Simpson, correct.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection; relevance, materiality.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I did.

MR. BAKER: That exhibit number?

MR. P. BAKER: 2040.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, sir, those blood drops were significant, were
they not?

A. To me, they were.

Q. And you noted those in your notes, did you not?

A. I did.

Q. And they were significant because those blood drops were more
likely than not to be the blood drops of the perpetrator of the crime,
correct?

A. No, I didn't believe so. In fact --

Q. Well, you knew they weren't the blood drops of the victim?

A. I believe there's a very good chance that they are, indeed, the
blood drops of the victims, or a mixture. However, I wanted to know --
to clarify that, obviously.

Q. And you asked or directed the coroner's office to -- to sample
those blood drops, correct?

A. I did.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Outside the court's order.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. MEDVENE: We object. Relevance. Outside the court's order.

THE COURT: Well, to some extent, I'm going to allow cross-examination,
since you made an extensive examination of this witness with regard to
the blood and blood drops in the area.

MR. MEDVENE: Okay. Just may we be heard, Your Honor?

MR. PETROCELLI: Can we be heard on that, Your Honor?

THE COURT: No.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Mr. Lange, those blood drops certainly could
have been -- regardless, we'll never know that they are -- but they
could have been the blood drops of the perpetrator of the crime,
correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Those blood drops, you told Ratcliffe to collect and
analyze, true?

A. I requested that of her, yes.

Q. That never occurred?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) To your knowledge, did it ever occur that those
blood drops were analyzed?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you analyzed the closed-in area in some detail
when you were at the crime scene on the 13th of June, did you not?

A. I believe so.

(Counsel displays blow-up.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, for the record, there was an exhibit to
Exhibit 2040, that last exhibit, that is not what 2040 is, according
--

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. PETROCELLI: That is not what Exhibit 2040 is, according to --

MR. P. BAKER: 2040. I was in error. It's actually 835.

THE COURT: 835?

MR. P. BAKER: Yes.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photo of victim's back was
marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 835.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Mr. Lange, you went into the area that you
described as 4 feet by 6 feet, the caged-in area, did you not?

A. I went in it.

Q. Yeah, after the body of Mr. Goldman had been discovered?

A. I had been in there, yes.

Q. And you carefully observed the evidence that was contained in that
area, sir?

A. I did observe evidence in that area, yes.

Q. And did you observe the boot that you talked about, the left boot
of Mr. Goldman?

I'm sorry. I can't make it any easier for you to see here.

A. Yeah, I can see it.

Q. Well, that doesn't comport with me going in there. That boot you
see, I believe, was when Mr. Goldman was in there.

I did observe that after he had been -- before I went in there, yes.

THE COURT: Excuse me. What is that chart, Exhibit number?

MR. BAKER: What is it?

MR. P. BAKER: 1342.

THE COURT: That's the big board?

MR. P. BAKER: Yes.

THE COURT: Thank you.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph of blood stains from
closed-in area at Bundy was marked for identification as Defendants'
Exhibit No. 1342.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Looking at the lower right-hand photograph, there
was blood that you observed in the boot of Mr. Goldman, correct? The
size of the drop --

A. Can I take a look at this?

Q. Sure. Help yourself.

A. Yes. I believe that photo was taken after Mr. Goldman was removed
from that caged-in area; and I did observe that, yes.

Q. Didn't that indicate to you, as a detective of some 20 years'
duration, that Mr. Goldman or someone else had bled, and then Mr.
Goldman had stepped into blood in the dirt, dirt or caged or closed-in
area, correct?

A. By looking at that, I have two interpretations of that.

Q. Well, can you answer my question, sir?

A. I'll try.

Q. My question was: The fact that you see blood and caked dirt,
indicates to you that there was bleeding, and then Mr. Goldman stepped
in the dirt with blood on it during the time that he was in the
closed-in area; true or untrue?

A. That's certainly possible, yes.

Q. And is it probable?

A. Yes, it is. I would say it is.

Q. If that would that be a reasonable interpretation of the dirt on
the bottom of the boot; that is, that he had been bleeding in the
closed-in area and then stepped in an area where he had been bleeding
and blood and dirt got on the sole of his left boot, true?

A. That's reasonable.

Q. And indeed, did you observe sir, the blood-pattern evidence on the
bars around the closed-in area, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection; relevance, materiality, outside the scope.

THE COURT: You may answer whether you observed it or not.

This witness testified to observation of blood in the location you
asked on direct.

THE WITNESS: I observed what might be termed pattern evidence, but
also transfer evidence, things of that nature.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, the blood evidence that's on the bar that goes
up at 10, that is -- in other words, this again is the, if you will,
the center photograph. And the red lines go to, you know, where --
right from here. So this would be the -- that would be the east side
of the closed-in area, would it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And the -- there is -- that over there in the middle picture on the
right, what would you describe that as?

Is that a blood smear or blood stain?

A. This picture here?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. Suppose one could describe that as perhaps a swipe or some type of
transfer.

Q. Very well.

Don't you detectives have -- and criminalists have certain vernacular
that you use to describe various types of blood evidence?

In other words, a swipe or something else, or a transfer?

Is it a swipe, in your opinion, as contrasted to a smear?

A. Well, I don't necessarily differentiate between a swipe and a
smear.

Q. Okay.

A. I suppose that could be a said subjective thing.

Q. But in any event, sir, even though you don't differentiate, did
that pattern, that blood evidence on the east rung of the gate or --
strike that -- fence indicate to you that it was an area where Mr.
Goldman had been during the struggle?

A. To me, just looking at these photos, it would indicate the
probability of that, yes.

Q. And then if you look at the upper right-hand photo -- and that's
actually a blow-up of the middle upper photo, sir, middle upper?

A. Yeah. I was just looking at the relationship here. Yeah.

Q. There is a -- there's blood evidence on the lower rung of the
fence, is there not, that would indicate to you that Mr. Goldman had
been standing in that area for a period of time because there's blood
evidence on that rung, correct?

A. I don't know that. I couldn't necessarily say that he had been
standing --

Q. He was at least above the area where the blood is seen on that
lower bar of the fence?

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, opinions are requested that are way
beyond the scope of our direct examination, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You would agree with that, sir?

A. Possibility.

Q. Probability, would you not agree?

A. Well, not necessarily.

Q. There's some blood that came from above that bar, did it not, sir?

A. Again, it's a possibility; unless someone were lying there, reached
up and grabbed the bar for some reason.

Q. Is that not a drop, as contrasted to a smear? I'm talking --

A. You're looking down here. You told me the bottom rung. Are you
referring to something up higher?

Q. No, sir; that's what I was referring to.

A. Perhaps you could specifically show me and --

Q. I apologize.

Is this not blood-drop evidence that came down and dropped?

And you can see from the tentacle is this not blood-drop evidence? And
is this not blood-drop evidence?

A. Yes, these appear to be drops, certainly.

Q. Over on the right-hand photograph, that would appear to be blood
that is pooled in the area, indicating that Mr. Goldman had been above
that area and had been in that area for some time, correct?

A. Again, it's certainly a possibility. But as soon as I say that, I
imagine there's experts somewhere that could dispute that and come up
with a different theory.

I'm telling you it's a possibility.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) We're here for your opinions.

A. I believe I just gave it to you.

Q. Is it a probability that Mr. Goldman, sir, was upright and above
that area for some period of time, in order for that blood to have
pooled in the area where it's indicated on the upper right-hand
photograph of the exhibit in front of you?

A. Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Vague and ambiguous on time. It's outside the scope and
it's compound, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I'm going to allow some latitude on the blood testimony.
You asked on direct. I'm going to allow it. It's a reasonable
cross-examination. Overruled.

THE WITNESS: It's certainly possible, but I can't say that that's what
happened.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you would agree with me, would you not, Mr.
Lange, that the blood evidence that indicated between the fence and
the concrete block -- well, strike that. Let me see if I can say it so
that we both understand.

This block is outside Ms.` Nicole Brown Simpson's property. The fence
ends here and the block is on the other side, correct?

A. Outside is north of that.

Q. Correct. Correct. North. I'm sorry.

So the blood evidence that is shown in the upper right-hand photograph
here, is blood evidence that would, of necessity, have pooled on the
side of the fence, and then seeped north, over to that concrete
walkway, correct?

A. Not necessarily. Looking at this, it could have dripped down, I
suppose. I mean, it's all conjecture.

Q. If it dripped down, in any event, both of those cakes of blood
indicate that Mr. Goldman was above that area, and was there for a
period of time, to account for the amount of blood that is shown in
the photograph. True or untrue?

A. I couldn't say one way or the other. Again, I'll qualify that it's
certainly a possibility of that occurring.

Q. Now, look at the photograph on the left side, the middle left
photograph.

A. This photograph here?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. 101?

Q. Yes, sir.

Now, you know the difference between a shoe print and a shoe
impression, do you not?

A. I believe so.

Q. And a shoe print is a two-dimensional impression of a shoe, true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And an impression would be three-dimensional; that is, the shoe
would sit down into some soft material, such as loam soil that we had
in the dirted area at 875 South Bundy, right?

A. That's what it is, yes.

Q. And you believe that that area that the hole -- there was a hole
that very probably was made during the time of the murders and may
contain impression evidence, true?

A. No. I believe it's very possible it was made during the struggle.
As far as impression evidence, I didn't see any, so I can't make that
assumption.

Q. But you did see the hole, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. How deep was it, six inches?

A. I believe it was around six, eight inches, somewhere in that area.

Q. How wide was it?

A. I don't recall. I could speculate. Fourteen inches.

Q. Let's not speculate. If you have an estimate -- you were there when
the hole was presumably in the same position it's in now, because --
or in the photograph, rather, because that was taken on the 13th,
right?

A. Yes. This is different dimensions. It's dug out in different areas;
it's down at an angle. So it varies. It could go all the way at the
bottom, which I suppose is 18 inches, all the way out to two feet.

Q. That obviously took some period of time to dig that impression
during the struggle for `Mr. Goldman's life, true?

A. No. That soil back there is fairly loose, and I would assume this
could possibly happen in a matter of a few seconds.

Q. I see. A few seconds, two, three. Okay.

THE COURT: If this is not a convenient --

Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow is Friday. 9 o'clock. Don't talk about
the case; don't form or express any opinions.

THE COURT: Witness is ordered back tomorrow.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, could we address you for a minute?

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. MEDVENE: May we address you for a moment?

THE COURT: About what?

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, we questioned the witness limitedly
on that evidence that was being relied upon to show Mr. Simpson was
liable, mainly specific bloody footprints, specific blood drops.

We didn't question him about generally a scene and what else he
observed; we questioned him about only the items of evidence that we
intend to rely on.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, I understand your position. However, the Court
is of the opinion that plaintiffs cannot artificially limit the scope
of cross-examination when the plaintiff brings into -- brings before
the jury testimony with regards to blood. I think a reasonable degree
of cross-examination is allowed.

I've gone out of my way to sustain plaintiffs' position in limiting
cross-examination as to other aspects of this witness's testimony,
requiring the defense to call that witness as its own witness, if they
wish to explore that area.

I'm trying to be reasonable. And I think reason dictates that I allow
reasonable latitude in cross-examination about blood.

You offered this witness to testify to blood, what the blood looked
like, what the reasonable interpretation of the blood was with regards
to the tracking of the blood in a certain direction, blood drops going
in a certain direction; so I have to allow some reasonable latitude,
Mr. Medvene.

MR. MEDVENE: We understand the purpose of the examination, Your Honor.
For the last ten minutes was -- was length of struggle. We didn't put
the witness on for length of struggle.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, if the reasonable cross-examination has some
ancillary effect in affecting that aspect of that case, that's the
nature of the evidence.

MR. MEDVENE: We just want to make sure if it was open or not, Your
Honor. If it is, we'll go into it.

THE COURT: I think I made my position clear. I think the defense
understands what my position is. If they don't, make your objection,
and I will rule.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you very much.

(At 4:35 p.m., proceedings were adjourned until 9:00 a.m., Friday,
November 1, 1996.)

<h2>Arbitration Retainer Letter - Dennis Spencer Kahane</h2>
<PRE>
Contributor: Dennis Spencer Kahane

Address: 3130 Crow Canyon Place #270
San Ramon, California 94583

Fax: (510) 901-1104

 Arbitration retainer letter

    The  Law Offices of Dennis Spencer Kahane is available for the
private arbitration of business disputes. Arbitration is to be
conducted pursuant to the California Arbitration Act. All parties
must be represented by separate counsel.
    An Arbitration Agreement must be entered into:

1. Specifying the nature of the dispute;

2. Specifying the scope and extent of the issues to be arbitrated;


3. Specifying the procedure of the arbitration:
 
   a. written submission only (Opening Brief; Reply Brief;
Supporting Declarations and documentary evidence under affidavit);
   b. live testimony (direct and cross examination) and
identification of evidence;
   c. full trial (Opening and Closing Argument; live testimony;
Trial Brief)

4. Specifying the applicability or non-applicability of the rules
of evidence and the rules of civil procedure;

5. Specifying the arbitrator's powers and the acceptance and
enforceability of his Decision and Award;

6. Specifying the extent of the Decision sought by the parties:
  a. one-liner: who's won; how much?
  b. Findings of Fact; Conclusions; Award.
  c. Full legal decision; facts; reasoning; legal precedents based
 on arbitrator's independent research, aided by the parties' briefs.

7. Specifying whether the arbitrator's Decision shall be final
and unappeasable, even if a party believes it to be incorrect or
believes the arbitrator has failed to understand the facts or his
misread, misconstrued or misapplied the law. An agreement
respecting the finality of the arbitrator's decision will not
prohibit any party from filing a petition to correct or vacate the
Decision pursuant to the Arbitration Act, nor will it prevent any
party from requesting Reconsideration by the arbitrator pursuant
to the Arbitration Act.

 8. Specifying that each party will pay its proportional share of
the arbitrator's fees (two parties, each pays one- half), subject
to (or not subject to) reapportionment in favor of the prevailing
party. Fees are figured at the usual hourly rates of the Law
Offices of Dennis Spencer Kahane, plus costs, as set forth in the
firm's Fee Schedule. A retainer of $5,000 is required ($2,500 from
each party, if two parties). The retainer must be replenished to
the $5,000 level upon billing. No work will be undertaken without
the appropriate retainer in the account. No decision will be
rendered without the retainer at the specified level.
   At the conclusion of the arbitration (after the time for
reconsideration has passed), any funds left on account will be
disbursed to the parties in accordance with their percentage of
contribution, and without regard to any provision awarding costs
to the prevailing party. No party may defeat the arbitration by
failing to pay or to replenish the retainer. The parties must
agree (and so state in the Arbitration Agreement or by separate
subsequent agreement) that the failure of any party to pay timely
into the retainer account such amounts as are required shall
result in a default Decision and Award against such party.

There may be no ex-parte telephone calls to the arbitrator: all
communication shall be by
  (a) mail, courier, or facsimile telecopier (fax) with a copy
sent by the same mode to the opposing party or parties, or
  (b) by pre-arranged all-party conference either (i) in person or
(ii) by telephone. Conferences may be either attorneys-only or
attorneys and clients, as the arbitrator may decide upon request
of counsel.  The scheduling of conferences, etc., may be discussed
by telephone with the arbitrator's secretary.

The parties are encouraged to make their Arbitration Agreement as
thorough as possible. In a private arbitration the precise terms,
constraints, limitations on damages, and scope, as set forth in
the Arbitration Agreement, govern the arbitration proceeding and
the Decision and Award. the Law Offices of Dennis Spencer Kahane,
the parties agree that general principals respecting judicial
immunity shall apply to the arbitrator as well as such immunities
from liability as are provided in the Arbitration Act.

Finally, arbitration is NOT mediation. The arbitrator will NOT
attempt to settle any matter submitted. The parties are encouraged
to settle a matter during the pendency of the arbitration
proceeding if they so choose, but the arbitrator will not play a
role in such settlement. The arbitrator does not view his role in
resolving disputes as (in the Solomonic phrase) "cutting the baby
in half," i.e., deciding issue 1 for Party A and issue 2 for Party
B, unless such course is dictated by the facts and law. Issues
will be decided according to their merits, as the arbitrator sees
them and without any attempt to "balance" the Decision and Award.
Parties who seek a balanced result are advised to settle.

As a preliminary step toward retaining the Law Offices of Dennis
Spencer Kahane for arbitration, counsel are requested to forward
information so that any conflicts may be identified.

 The Law Offices of Dennis Spencer Kahane will not serve as an
arbitrator in any dispute where any one of the parties has a
pre-existing relationship with Dennis Kahane, either socially,
familiarly, or professionally as a client, unless upon full
disclosure a written waiver of conflict is signed by all parties.

Scientific Advisory Board of the Company for any reason, with
or without cause, including without limitation, a termination
by resignation, removal, death, disability, or failure to be
nominated or reelected by the Company's stockholders.
Nothing in this Plan shall confer upon any such Director or
Member of the Scientific Advisory Board, any right to continue
his or her association with the Company or shall interfere
with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and its
stockholders, which are hereby expressly reserved, to remove
any such 
person at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause.
     3.  Stock Subject to Plan.
     3.1  Stock Subject to Plan.  The stock subject to an
Award shall be shares of the Company's Common Stock.  The
aggregate number of such shares issued and outstanding
pursuant to Awards shall not exceed 75,000.
     3.2  Changes in Company Capitalization.  In the event
that (i) the outstanding shares of Common Stock are hereafter
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of
shares or other securities of the Company, or of another
entity, by reason of reorganization, merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, reclassification, or (ii) the number of
shares is increased or decreased by reason of a stock split,
stock dividend, combination of shares or any other increase or
decrease in the number of such shares of Common Stock effected
without receipt of consideration by the Company (provided,
however, that conversion or exchange of any convertible or
exchangeable securities of the Company shall not be deemed to
have been "effected without receipt of consideration"), then
the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments in the number
and kind of shares available for Awards, including adjustments
to the limitations in Section 3.1 on the maximum number and
kind of shares which may be issued and outstanding pursuant to
Awards.
     4.  Granting of Awards
     4.1  Eligibility.  Any  serving Outside Director or
Member of the Scientific Advisory Board shall be eligible for

     4.2  Grants.  Each person who is an Outside Director or
Member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Company at the
date of the adoption of this Plan shall be granted an Award of
5,000 shares of Common Stock.  Thereafter, on January 1 of
each year, the Committee shall grant a further Award of 5,000
shares of Common Stock to each Participant (so long as he or
she is an Outside Director or Member of the Scientific
Advisory Board on each such date).
     4.3  Administration of the Plan.
               (a)       The Plan shall be administered by the
Committee.  The Committee shall consist of at least two
Outside Directors (if there are such) selected by the Board of
Directors.  Committee members may resign by delivering written
notice to the Secretary.  Vacancies on the Committee shall be
filled by the Board of Directors.
               (b)       Except as otherwise provided in the
Plan and except as otherwise expressly stated to the contrary

authority  (i) to impose such conditions and restrictions on
Awards as it determines appropriate, (ii) to interpret the
Plan, (iii) to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and
regulations relating to the Plan, (iv) to determine Fair
Market Value in accordance with Section 2.9 (c), and (v) to
take any other actions in connection with the Plan and to make
all determinations under the Plan as it may deem necessary or
advisable for the administration of the Plan.  The
determinations of the Committee on the matters referred to in
this Section 4 shall be binding and conclusive on all persons.
               (c)       A majority of the members of the
Committee shall constitute a quorum.  All determinations of
the Committee shall be made by a majority of its members.  Any
decision or determination reduced to writing and signed by all
of the members of the Committee shall be fully effective as if
it had been made by a majority vote at a meeting duly called
and held.
               (d)       The Committee may delegate to one or
more persons any of its powers, or designate one or more
persons to do or perform those matters to be done or performed
by the Committee, including administration of the Plan.  Any
person or persons delegated or designated by the Committee
shall be subject to the same obligations and requirements
imposed on the Committee and its members under the Plan.
               (e)       Members of the Committee shall
receive such compensation for their services as members as may
be determined by the Board of Directors.  All expenses and
liabilities incurred by members of the Committee in connection
with the administration of the Plan shall be borne by the
Company.  The Committee may employ attorneys, consultants,
accountants, appraisers, brokers, or other persons.  The
Committee, the Company, and its Officers and Directors shall
be entitled to rely upon the advice, opinions, or valuations
of any such persons.  All elections taken and all
interpretations and determinations made by the Committee in
good faith shall be final and binding upon all Participants,
the Company, and all other interested persons.  No member of
the Committee shall be personally liable for any action,
determination or interpretation made in good faith with
respect to the Plan.  Members of the Committee and each person
or persons designed or delegated by the Committee shall be
entitled to indemnification by the Company for any action or
any failure to act in connection with services performed by or
on behalf of the Committee for the benefit of the Company to
the fullest extent provided or permitted by the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, any insurance policy, or
other agreement intended for the benefit of the Committee, or
by any applicable law.
     5.  Terms of Grants
     5.1  Grant Agreement.         
Each Grant shall be evidenced by a written Grant Agreement , 
which shall be signed by the Participant and by an authorized 
Officer of the Company and which shall refer to such terms and 
conditions as the Committee shall determine, consistent with the Plan.  
     5.2  Issuance of Shares.  Participants shall be issued a
certificate for fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock for the number of shares covered by the Award, which
certificate may contain a legend referring to restrictions on
vesting and transfer and such other terms and conditions as
the Committee shall determine, consistent with the Plan.
     5.3  Forfeiture of Unvested Shares.   Shares which have
been awarded but not yet vested under this Section 5.3 shall
be forfeited if the Participant ceases to be a Director or
Member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Company for any
reason, with or without cause, including without limitation, a
termination by resignation, removal, death, disability, or
failure to be nominated or reelected by the Company's
stockholders, unless provided to the contrary in any Grant
Agreement approved by the Committee between the Participant
and the Company, which Agreement shall govern any further
vesting of shares pursuant to Awards.
     5.4  Fair Market Value.  The Company shall provide to
each Participant who receives an Award information regarding
the Fair Market Value of the Company's shares on the date such
Award is granted.  Such information shall be provided to
permit the Participant to determine his or her federal income
tax liability, if any, for such Award, or to permit the
Participant to make the election contemplated by Section 78 of
the Internal Revenue Code.
     5.5  Transfer Restrictions; Vesting.
               (a)       Unless otherwise approved in writing
by the Committee, no shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to
an Award may be sold, assigned, pledged, encumbered, or
otherwise transferred until (i) they have vested, and (ii)
either the Company has made an offering of its shares to the
public pursuant to a registration statement under the
Securities Act or there has been a Change of Control of the
Company, except as may be provided in Section 5.5(c) or as may
otherwise be provided for in an Grant Agreement which has been
approved by the Committee.   The Committee, in its absolute
discretion, may impose such other restrictions on the
transferability of the shares granted pursuant to an Award as
it deems appropriate.  Any such other restriction shall be set
forth in the respective Grant Agreement and may be referred to
on the certificates evidencing such shares.  
               (b)       Shares issued pursuant to Awards
shall vest 20% at the end of the first year of service after
the date of the Award and 1/12 of 20% at the end of each month
thereafter.  Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.3,
5.5(c), and 5.5(d), Awards shall otherwise become vested at
such times and in such installments (which may be cumulative)
as the Committee shall provide in the terms of each individual
Grant Agreement; provided, however, that by resolution adopted
after an Award is granted the Committee may, on such terms and
conditions as it may determine to be appropriate and subject
to Sections 5.3, 5.5(c), and 5.5(d), accelerate the time at
which such Award or any portion thereof may be vested, or such
rights may be set forth in an agreement between the
Participant and the Company which has been approved by the
Committee.
               (c)       No portion of an Award which is
unvested at Termination of Relationship shall thereafter
become vested; provided, however, that provision may be made
that such Award shall become vested in the event of a
Termination of Relationship as may be determined by the
Committee, or such rights may be set forth in a Grant
Agreement between the Participant and the Company which has
been approved by the Committee.
               (d)       Subject to the provisions of Section
5.5(a), the Committee shall provide, in terms of each
individual Grant Agreement when such Award becomes vested, and
(without limiting the generality of the foregoing) the
Committee may provide in the terms of individual Grant
Agreements that unvested shares shall be forfeited immediately
upon a Termination of Relationship; provided, however, that
provision may be made that such shares shall become vested in
the event of a Termination of Relationship because of the
Participant's retirement, death, disability, or as may
otherwise be determined by the Committee.
     5.6  No Right to Continued Relationship. Nothing in this
Plan or in any Grant Agreement issued hereunder shall confer
upon any Participant, any right to continue his or her
association with the Company or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of the Company and its
stockholders, which are hereby expressly reserved, to remove
any such person at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause.
     6.  Additional Provisions. 
     6.1  Nontransferability.  No unvested shares issued
pursuant to an Award or interest or right therein or part
thereof shall be liable for the debts, contracts or
engagements of the Ptanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Committee shall not amend or modify the
Plan more than once every six (6) months or in any other
manner inconsistent with the requirements of Rule 16b-
3(c)(2)(ii) except to the extent required by changes in the
Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, or regulations and rules issued thereunder.  No
termination or amendment of the Plan may, without the consent
of a Participant, adversely affect the rights of such
Participant notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.
No Award may be granted during any period of suspension of the
Plan nor after termination of the Plan, and in no event may
any Award be granted under this Plan after August 30, 2004.
     6.5  Duties of the Company.  The Company shall pay all
original issue taxes with respect to the issuance or delivery
of shares pursuant to an Award and all other fees and expenses
necessarily incurred by the Company in connection therewith.
     6.6  Absence of a Committee.  Should the Board of
Directors fail to appoint the Committee or should there be no
Committee for any other reason, then the Plan shall be
administered by the Board of Directors.   In the absence of a
Committee, the Board of Directors (or that portion thereof
comprised in accordance with this Section 6.6) shall have all
the powers of the Committee as set forth herein in
administration of the Plan.
     7.  General Provisions.
     7.1  No Rights.   Neither the adoption and maintenance of
the Plan, the granting of Awards pursuant to the Plan, nor
issuance of shares pursuant to Awards shall be deemed to
constitute a contract of employment between the Company and
any Participant or to be a condition of the employment of any
person.  The Plan and any Awards granted under the Plan shall
not confer upon any Participant any right with respect to a
continued relationship with  the Company, nor shall they
interfere in any way with the right of the Company or its
shareholders to terminate the relationship of any Participant
with the Company at any time, and for any reason, with or
without cause.
     7.2  Costs of Administration.  The Company shall pay all
costs and expenses of administering the Plan.

governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may
be required.  The provisions of this Plan shall be interpreted
so as to comply with the conditions and requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and rules and regulations
issued thereunder, including without limitation Rule 16b-3,
unless a contrary interpretation of any such provisions
otherwise required by applicable law.  Except to the extent
preempted by Federal law, this Plan and all Stock Option
Agreements entered into pursuant hereto shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the
State of Delaware, determined without regard to its conflict
of laws rules.

<h2>Confidentiality Agreement - Graham & James</h2>

Editor's notes: See also, "Short Confidentiality Agreement" and
"Distributorship Agreement." Author's caveats: These two
confidentiality agreements are intended for use by companies and
individuals in the multimedia industry in connection with the
evaluation of the feasibility of various commercial transactions,
as well as the negotiation of those transactions. 

Some of the general considerations multimedia companies and
individuals may wish to bear in mind in protecting their
confidential information:

I. Other types of confidentiality agreements: Agreements are
appropriate for a range of purposes. On one end of the continuum
is the initial communication with a prospective business partner
or other party. For that purpose, parties will most likely want to
use the Short Form agreement which will not be as likely to create
obstacles to the formation of a commercial relationship. On the
other end of the continuum is the consummation of the transaction
itself, for which the parties may want a more detailed agreement
which specifies the confidential information that will be
disclosed. The long form agreement would be most appropriate for
dealings which fall in the middle of the continnum -- intended to
provide adequate protection while facilitating the formation of
the business relationship.

II. Types of Information to be Protected:  A. Trade secrets: One
of the best ways to protect trade secrets is by requiring others
to sign a confidentiality agreement before those trade secrets are
disclosed to them. B. Other Confidential Information: Information
which might not rise to the level of a trade secret may
nonetheless be protected to some extent by a confidentiality
agreement. Additionally, methods, ideas and concepts which might
not be subject to protection under patent or copyright can often
be protected as trade secrets.

III. Another alternative: reciprocity: Parties may wish to use a
reciprocal form of confidentiality agreement (where both parties
are disclosing confidential information). Advantages include:

A. The multimedia company or individual will be prepared to
provide the other party with its form of agreement, avoiding the
possibility that the other party will impose its predrafted form
(a form which could provide less protection); B. A reciprocal form
helps create the impression that there is an intent to do business
in an even-handed manner; C. Parties may be more willing to sign
the agreement because it is reciprocal; The disadvantage of
signing a reciprocal agreement is that the other party could claim
that its confidential information had been used in breach of the
agreement. To attempt to avoid this risk, it would be advisable to
define the confidential information of both parties as clearly as
possible.

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

THIS CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into
on ________________________, 1994, by and between Multimedia Co.,

connection with the Business Purposes, which is not generally
available to the public.

II. Nondisclosure Obligations. Receiving Party promises and agrees

Confidential Information to unfairly compete or obtain unfair
advantage vis a vis Disclosing Party in any commercial activity
which may be comparable to the commercial activity contemplated by
the parties in connection with the Business Purposes.   E. to
restrict access to the Confidential Information to those of its
officers, directors, and employees who clearly need such access to
carry out the Business Purposes.   F. to advise each of the
persons to whom it provides access to any of the Confidential
Information, that such persons are strictly prohibited from making
any use, publishing or otherwise disclosing to others, or
permitting others to use for their benefit or to the detriment of

Request of Disclosing Party, to provide Disclosing Party with a
copy of a written agreement to that effect signed by such persons.
G. to comply with any other reasonable security measures requested

III.  Exceptions.  The confidentiality obligations hereunder shall
not apply to Confidential Information which: A. is, or later

Disclosing Party, as evidenced by written records; or C. is
independently received by Receiving Party from a third party, with
no restrictions on disclosure.

IV.   Return of Confidential Information. Receiving Party agrees,
upon termination of the Business Purposes or upon the written
request of Disclosing Party, whichever is earlier, to promptly
deliver to Disclosing Party all records, notes, and other written,
printed, or tangible materials in the possession of Receiving
Party, embodying or pertaining to the Confidential Information. 

V. No Right to Confidential Information.   A. Receiving Party
hereby agrees and acknowledges that no license, either express or
implied, is hereby granted to Receiving Party by Disclosing Party

works and designs relating to machines, methods, compositions, or
products of Disclosing Party directly resulting from or relating
to the Confidential Information and the right to market, use,
license and franchise the Confidential Information or the ideas,
concepts, methods or practices embodied therein shall be the
exclusive property of Disclosing Party, and Receiving Party has no
right or title thereto.

VI.    No Solicitation of Employees.  Receiving Party agrees that
it will not, for a period of five (5) years from the date of this
Agreement, initiate contact with Disclosing Party's employees in
order to solicit, entice or induce any employee of Disclosing
Party to terminate an employment relationship with Disclosing
Party to accept employment with Receiving Party.

VII.   Losses.  Receiving Party agrees to indemnify Disclosing

the foregoing, Receiving Party's obligations with respect to the
Confidential Information hereunder shall continue in full force
and effect until further notice from Disclosing Party. 

IX.  Remedies. Receiving Party understands and acknowledges that
any disclosure or misappropriation of any of the Confidential
Information in violation of this Agreement may cause Disclosing
Party irreparable harm, the amount of which may be difficult to
ascertain and, therefore, agrees that Disclosing Party shall have
the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an
order restraining any such further disclosure or misappropriation
and for such other relief as Disclosing Party shall deem
appropriate. Such right of Disclosing Party shall be in addition
to Remedies otherwise available to the Disclosing Party at law or
in equity.

to enforce or interpret the provisions of this Agreement, the
prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to reasonable
attorneys' fees.

<H3>FUNDAMENTALS OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION</H3><p>

<P>In counseling businesses and reviewing their business materials, we find that copyright is the least understood and most frequently ignored form of intellectual property protection. Many businesses don't even realize that they are creating or using copyrighted works on a regular basis. Copyright is a form of intellectual property protection which subsists in original works of authorship. Works that are protected by copyright include the following broad categories: (1) literary works; (2) musical works; (3) dramatic works; (4) choreographic works; (5) pictorial, graphic and sculptural works; (6) motion pictures and other audiovisual works; and (7) sound recordings.</P>

<H4>A Copyright Owner's Exclusive Rights.</h4>

<P>Subject to certain limitations, a copyright owner has several exclusive rights regarding his or her original work of authorship. These exclusive rights include (1) the right to copy the work; (2) the right to distribute the work; and (3) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, the right to perform the copyrighted work publicly.[Note 1] Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of a copyright owner is an infringer of the copyright. Copyright protection begins as soon as an original work of authorship is "fixed" in any tangible medium of expression. In essence, as soon as pen is put to paper and original text appears, a copyright exists. Copyright protection exists for both published and unpublished works, for both two- and three- dimensional works, and for derivative works based upon an original copyrighted work. Copyright is a lengthy form of protection. Most works are protected for the life of the author plus fifty years, or, in the case of works made for hire, seventy-five years from the date of first publication, or one hundred years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first.</P>

<H4>Requirements for Copyright Protection.</h4>

<P><A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc/17/overview.html">The Copyright Act</a> imposes only three basic requirements in order for a work to qualify for copyright protection and be eligible for copyright registration. First, the work must be original, i.e., not been copied from another source. <I>Baker v. Selden</i>, 101 U.S. 99, 102 (1879). Second, the work must consist of "expression," not just "ideas." Third, the work must be fixed in a "tangible medium of expression . . . from which [it] can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device." 17 U.S.C. 102(a). Most written materials, including publications, photographs, videotapes, etc., probably meet these three basic qualifying requirements. Businesses should consider copyright protection for all their past, current and future written or graphic materials. Some past materials may not be protected for technical or legal reasons, however, businesses can certainly make advance plans for copyright protection with every new project.</P>

<H4>Work For Hire Issues.</h4>

<P>One reason copyright protection should be considered in advance of any new project is that every copyrighted work has an "author." The author is the person who creates the work and is most often the person who owns the copyright. An employer is automatically the "author" of any work prepared by an employee in the course of his or her employment. Absent a written agreement to the contrary, anything produced by an employee is presumed to belong to the employer as a work made for hire. Nonemployees are treated differently for copyright purposes. If a business wants to claim copyright ownership of a work created by a nonemployee or group of nonemployees, it should have an advance written agreement with the nonemployee or group of nonemployees. There are a few limited circumstances where an advance written agreement may not be required (e.g., where the work is specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work), but the language of the Copyright Act is vague enough that we recommend that a written agreement be used with all nonemployees and for all projects. Any agreement with a nonemployee must specifically provide that the commissioned work is a "work made for hire" and that copyright belongs to the contracting business. You also need a separate "work for hire" agreement for each new project. Open-ended agreements are not effective. And, if there is no effective written agreement, the odds are great that the nonemployee will be deemed the "author" and will own all rights in the work. A copyright assignment can always be executed after the work is created, however, it is more difficult to convince independent contractors to relinquish their rights after the project is finished. This is especially true when it appears that the work has (or may have) significant economic value. In setting any new project with any third party, including independent contractors and outside consultants, we recommend that you request a work for hire agreement. Attached as Exhibit "1" is a sample work for hire agreement in letter format. This same language can be incorporated into a formal agreement. Again, this agreement should be executed before work begins on any project. Even if the same consultant works on multiple projects, a separate work for hire agreement should be executed for each work.</P>

<h4>Copyright Notice.</h4>

<P>In addition to securing work for hire agreements with third parties, we recommend that a copyright notice be included on all new written materials. Until March 1, 1989, U.S. law required that a copyright notice be displayed on all publicly distributed copies of a work. Failure to comply with the notice requirements for pre- March 1989 works means that for the most part, and strictly from a copyright perspective, a work is placed in the "public domain." On March 1, 1989, the United States implemented certain amendments to the Copyright Act, bringing this country into compliance with an international copyright treaty known as <A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/overview.html"> the Berne Convention</a>.</P>

<P>Once the United States joined the Berne Convention the copyright notice requirement was eliminated as a condition for copyright protection. Again, a copyright notice is not required, except for works distributed prior to March 1, 1989. However, businesses should include copyright notices, since the notice is a reasonably strong deterrent against infringement. Moreover, if a copyright notice is included and the work is copied, a defense based on innocent infringement is not available. The Copyright Act requires that copyright notices follow a specified form. An acceptable copyright notice consists of (1) the symbol &#169;  (the letter "c" in a circle), or the word "Copyright", or the abbreviation "Copr." and (2) the year of first publication; and (3) the name of the copyright owner. 17 U.S.C.  401. The phrase "all rights reserved" can also be added, but is not required. A typical copyright notice would take the following form: &#169;  1994 Arter & Hadden. All rights reserved.</P>

<H4>Copyright Registration.</h4>

<P>Copyright registration is a prerequisite for any action for infringement involving works of U.S. origin. A standard copyright registration can be obtained within two to three months by filing a simple two-page form, attaching a photograph or copy of the work and submitting a $20 fee. Expedited registration is also possible, especially when there is impending litigation. An application for registration with a request for special handling takes about ten (10) working days and requires a higher filing fee. It is best not to delay copyright registration for any new work. In a civil action where the registration is filed prior to the date of the infringement or within three months of first publication of the work[Note 2], the copyright holder can secure injunctive relief, and may elect to recover either statutory or actual damages and profits of the infringer. 17 U.S.C. sections 502 and 504. If the work is not registered prior to the date of the infringement (or within three months of first publication), the copyright owner is not entitled to statutory damages or attorneys' fees. Of course, the court can order actual damages and injunctive relief. 17 U.S.C section 412.</P>

<H4>Establishing a Prima Facie Claim of Infringement.</h4> 

<P>To establish a prima facie claim of copyright infringement, two basic elements must be proved: (a) ownership of a valid copyright in each infringed work, and (b) "copying" by Defendants (or violation of another of the exclusive rights provided to a copyright owner by the Copyright Act). Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner is an infringer of the copyright. 17 U.S.C. section 501(a).</P>

<H4>a. Ownership.</h4>

<P>The first factor, ownership, is most often shown through certificates of copyright registration for each of the copyright works involved. The Copyright Act specifies that in any judicial proceeding, a certificate of copyright registration made before or within five (5) years constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate. 17 U.S.C. section 410(c). Where a registration certificate is produced, the burden shifts to the defendant to present evidence of copyright invalidity, a license, or another defense.</P>

<H4>b. Proof of Infringement.</h4>

<P>It is axiomatic that there can be no infringement unless there has been a copying of the copyrighted work, or violation of another of the copyright owner's exclusive rights. Copying or violation of the exclusive rights of a copyright owner is proved by showing first that the defendant had access to the copyrighted work, and second, that the defendant reproduced or distributed copies that are substantially similar to the copyrighted work. The Copyright Act defines "copies" as "material objects . . . in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. The term 'copies' includes the material object, other than a phonorecord, in which the work is first fixed." 17 U.S.C. section 101 (1978).</P>

<H4>1. Access.</h4>

<P>Direct evidence of access to the copyrighted work is often not available. Access is more than evidence of adherence to the general ideas expressed, since ideas standing alone cannot be copyrighted. Similarity in expression also is not infringing to the extent the nature of the creation makes the similarity necessary. Accordingly, indispensable expression of generalized ideas may only be protected against virtually identical copying. If the copies are close but not substantially similar in terms of protected expression, there can be no infringement, since it is not a violation to possess something which only comes close to being copyright infringement. In some cases, particularly those involving counterfeits of sound recordings, motion pictures or mass marketed "off-the-shelf" computer software, the copies involved will be exact copies of the whole of a copyrighted work. Unauthorized literal reproduction of the whole, or substantially the whole, of a copyrighted work constitutes an infringement. Even when only a section or part of the original work has been copied, substantial similarity can be shown, since literal copying of even one section will, in most cases, defy coincidence. Common errors can also be used to prove copying by reducing the statistical probability that the defendant's work is original. Indirect copying can also be a violation of the copyright owner's exclusive rights. For example, paraphrasing, done to a great extent, is copying and an infringement. A copy made from an infringing copy is also an infringement of the original. It makes no difference that the pirate did not know that the version from which he was copying was infringing; he at least knew that what he was copying was not his. Even the fact that an infringer acknowledges the source from which the appropriated matter was derived does not relieve him of legal liability.</P>

<H4>2. Effect of First Sale Doctrine on Copyright Infringement Proceeding.</h4>

<P>Because infringement can occur as a result of both unauthorized reproduction and unauthorized distribution of copies of a copyrighted work, the first sale doctrine must also be considered. Unauthorized distribution of a copyrighted work is an infringement because the Copyright Act provides the copyright owner with the exclusive right "to distribute copies . . . of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending," and "[a]nyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner . . . is an infringer of the copyright." The legislative history of the Copyright Act makes it clear that "any unauthorized public distribution of copies . . . that were unlawfully made would be an infringement." The copyright owner's distribution right is akin to an exclusive right to control the first publication or first public distribution of copies or phonorecords of the work. This concept, known as the "first sale" doctrine, gives the copyright owner the right to sell or publicly distribute particular copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work. The distribution right ceases once the owner has parted with those particular copies or phonorecords. The Copyright Act states that the owner of a particular, lawfully made copy or phonorecord is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord. The first sale doctrine applies only where the possibility exists that the person possessing the copyrighted work obtained it lawfully. In other words, if you own a lawfully made copy, you have the right to sell that copy to another party. The only exceptions are sound recordings and software, which may not be rented or leased without the authorization of the copyright owner.[Note 3] There can be no lawful distribution of pirated or counterfeit copies of a work because the copyright holder cannot, by definition, part with legal title through a first sale. The first sale doctrine is a defense in copyright infringement cases. When a defendant presents evidence that the copies in question were legally made and that he or she owned them, the burden shifts to the copyright owner to demonstrate that the copies were either not legally made or not owned by the defendant.</P>

<H4>Remedies for Infringement.</h4>

<P>Copyright law provides both civil and criminal remedies against infringers. Most infringement actions are pursued as civil matters in federal court. Statutory damages, which most copyright holders elect, range from $500 to $20,000 for each non-willful infringement and up to $100,00 for each willful infringement. 17 U.S.C.  504(c). Actual damages are sought in some cases, and when this occurs, the infringer's profits are added to the award. In establishing the infringer's profits, the copyright holder is required to present proof only of the infringer's gross revenue, and the burden then shifts to the infringer to prove his or her deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. section 504(b). In a civil infringement action, a prevailing copyright holder is also entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. 17 U.S.C. section 505. This makes infringement litigation economically feasible. Most copyright plaintiffs request injunctive relief, including temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions. The injunctive relief available under the Copyright Act is effective throughout the United States. 17 U.S.C. section 502(b). A court can also order the seizure and impoundment of infringing items. Seizure orders often extend to the equipment used by the infringers (e.g., screens, diskette duplicators) and sometimes even the trucks, vans and cars used to transport infringing goods. As part of a final judgment or decree, the court will frequently order the destruction or forfeiture of all infringing copies or phonorecords as well as all plates, molds, tapes, film negatives and other articles used for reproduction. 17 U.S.C. section 503(b). Additional remedies may be available when infringing copies are created overseas and imported into the United States. Section 602 of the Copyright Act provides that the importation of unauthorized copies of a work is prohibited. 17 U.S.C. section 602. Any unauthorized "articles" which are imported are subject to seizure and forfeiture by the Customs Service. 17 U.S.C. section 603. Copyright infringement is also a crime. Criminal copyright infringement is defined under title 17 of the United States Code as willful infringement for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain. 17 U.S.C. section 506(a). Criminal copyright infringement, meaning the piracy[Note 4] and counterfeiting[Note 5] of all forms of copyrighted works, is prosecuted and punished in accordance with title 18 of the United States Code, covering crimes and criminal procedure. 18 U.S.C. section 1 et seq. (1948). It is a felony offense to to reproduce or distribute, within a 180-day period, more than ten unauthorized copies or phonorecords of one or more copyrighted works, with a collective value of more than $2,500. A five year prison term and a fine of up to $250,000 can be imposed. 18 U.S.C. section 2319(b). Where the offense is a second or subsequent offense, the term of imprisonment increases to ten years. 18 U.S.C. section 2319(b)(2).</P>

<H3>Conclusion</h3>

<P>Businesses create and use copyrighted works on a regular basis. Those who ignore copyright protection are missing tremendous opportunities and perhaps, placing themselves at great risk. We encourage all Arter & Hadden clients to consider copyright protection in advance and not wait for problems to develop.</P>

<P>Notes:

<OL>
<LI>A performance right attaches to all classes of copyrighted works except sound recordings and pictorial, graphic and sculptural works. It is not surprising that pictorial, graphic and sculptural works are excluded, since these works are not "performed," and in any event, they are protected with a separate display right. And, while it would seem logical to provide a performance right for sound recordings, the author of a sound recording is the singer or performer, and U.S. law has never recognized "performer's rights." Congress simply did not want to give performers control over their recordings of musical compositions. Of course, even though sound recordings are excluded, one should never assume that sound recordings can be performed with impunity. A public performance right does attach to the underlying musical composition, and the musical composition, not the sound recording, is infringed when an unauthorized performance occurs.

<LI>When registration occurs within three months of publication, all rights relate back to the date of first publication.

<LI>See 17 U.S.C. section 109(b)(1)(A) (1978) (neither the owner of a particular phonorecord nor any person in possession of a particular copy of a computer program . . . may, for the purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage, dispose of, or authorize the disposal of, the possession of that phonorecord or computer program . . . by rental, lease or lending . . . .); see also A&M Records, Inc. v. A.L.W., Ltd., 855 F.2d 368 (7th Cir. 1988) (holding that defendants who were shown to have rented records were liable for infringement).

<LI>"Piracy" or "bootlegging" are words popularly used to describe unauthorized duplication of sound recordings, films, tape cartridges, cassettes, software programs on floppy diskettes, video cassettes, and video games. A pirated copy or bootleg is an accurate copy of all or part of the original commercial version, but the package and graphics are usually unrelated in appearance to the original.

<LI>"Counterfeiting" is one step beyond piracy. A counterfeit will reproduce both the underlying work and the packaging, including color art, company labels, corporate logos and trademarks. A counterfeit is often difficult to distinguish from the original. Indeed, identification of counterfeits is often so difficult that unscrupulous retailers and distributors are able to meld the counterfeits into their stock of legitimate products. See United State v. Shultz, 482 F.2d 1179 (6th Cir. 1973).</OL>

APPOINTMENT OF DISTRIBUTOR
Section 2.01. Appointment.
Supplier hereby appoints Distributor as Supplier's nonexclusive
distributor of Products in the Territory, and Distributor accepts
that position. It is understood that Supplier cannot lawfully
prevent its distributors located elsewhere from supplying Products
for sale or use within the Territory and that it has no obligation
to do so. Section 2.01A. Appointment. Supplier hereby appoints
Distributor as Supplier's exclusive distributor of Products in the
Territory, and Distributor accepts that position. (a) Supplier, to
the extent that it is legally Permitted to do so, (i) shall not
appoint any distributor or servicer in the Territory for the
Products other than Distributor, (ii) shall not, and shall cause
any Affiliate not to, knowingly sell Products to any person other
than Distributor or a party designated by Distributor for use or
resale within the Territory (except pursuant to any agreement
effective at the time this Agreement became applicable to the
service so provided), and (iii) shall use its best efforts to
prevent any party other than Distributor from seeking customers
for the Products in the Territory, from establishing any branch
related to the distribution of Products in the Territory, or from
maintaining any distribution depot with respect to the Products in
the Territory. (b) If, notwithstanding Section 2.01(a), Supplier,
or any Affiliate, sells any Product which is eventually resold in
the Territory (other than a sale to Distributor or a party
designated by Distributor) and Supplier, or that Affiliate, had
reason to know at the time of its sale of that Product that such
resale was likely to occur, Supplier shall, immediately after the
trigger sale (which shall be the resale of the Product in the
territory or the sale immediately preceding the use of the Product
in the Territory) is contracted, pay to the Distributor _____
percent (_____%) of the price of that Product under this Agreement
at the time that the trigger sale was contracted, which payment
shall represent a recapture of certain advertising and capital
expenditures made by Distributor. Nothing contained in this
Section shall affect any other right or remedy which Distributor
may have pursuant to this Agreement. Section 2.02. Referrals. If
Supplier or any Affiliate is contacted by any party inquiring
about the purchase of Products in the Territory (other than
Distributor or a party designated by Distributor), Supplier shall,
or shall cause that Affiliate to, refer such party to Distributor
for handling. Section 2.03. Relationship of Parties. (a)
Distributor is an independent contractor and is not the legal
representative or agent of Supplier for any purpose and shall have
no right or authority (except as expressly provided in this
Agreement) to incur, assume or create in writing or otherwise, any
warrantyrol over any of Distributor's employees, all of whom are
entirely under the control of Distributor, who shall be
responsible for their acts and omissions. Distributor shall, at
its own expense, during the term of this Agreement and any
extension thereof, maintain full insurance under any Workmen's
Compensation Laws effective in the state or other applicable
jurisdiction covering all persons employed by and working for it
in connection with the performance of this Agreement, and upon
request shall furnish Supplier with satisfactory evidence of the
maintenance of such insurance. Distributor accepts exclusive
liability for all contributions and payroll taxes required under
Federal Social Security Laws and State Unemployment Compensation
Laws or other payments under any laws of similar character in any
applicable jurisdiction as to all persons employed by and working
for it. (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
create any partnership or joint venture relationship between the
parties. Section 2.04. Sale of Products by Distributor.
Distributor shall use its best efforts to distribute the Products
and fully to develop the market therefor within the Territory. (a)
The parties have consulted together and now agree that if
Distributor's best efforts are used as provided in this Section, a
minimum of _______ Products ("Annual Market Potential") will be
purchased and distributed in the Territory during the first year
of this Agreement. At the beginning of each subsequent year
hereunder the parties will consult together in good faith and
agree on the Annual Market Potential applicable to that year;
provided, however, that if they cannot agree, the Annual Market
Potential for the immediately Preceding year will apply to the
current year. Section 2.04A. Sale of Products by Distributor.
Distributor agrees to exercise its best efforts to develop the
largest possible market for the Products in the Territory and
shall continuously offer, advertise, demonstrate and otherwise
promote the sale of Products in the Territory. Section 2.05.
Competing Products. Distributor agrees that it will not distribute
or represent any Products in the Territory which compete with the
Products during the term of this Agreement or any extensions
thereof. Section 2.06. Advertising. Distributor shall be entitled,
during the term of the distributorship created by this Agreement
and any extension thereof, to advertise and hold itself out as an
authorized Distributor of the Products. At all times during the
term of the distributorship created by this Agreement and any
extension thereof, Distributor shall use the Trademarks in all
advertisements and other activities conducted by Distributor to
promote the sale of the Products. Distributor shall submit
examples of all proposed advertisements and other promotional
materials for the Products to Supplier for inspection and
Distributor shall not use any such advertisements or promotional
materials without having received the prior written consent of
Supplier to do so. Distributor shall not, pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise, have or acquire any right, title or
interest in or to Supplier's Trademarks. Section 2.07. New
Products. If Supplier or any Affiliate now or hereafter
manufactures or distributes, or proposes to manufacture or
distribute, any product other than the Products, Supplier shall
immediately notify, or cause such Affiliate to notify, Distributor
of that fact and of all details concerning that product.
Distributor may request from Supplier distribution rights for that
product in the Territory, or any portion thereof, and if so
requested, Supplier shall grant, or shall cause the subject
Affiliate to grant, such distribution rights to Distributor on
terms and conditions no less favorable than those provided in this
Agreement with respect to Products. If Distributor does not obtain
those distribution rights or obtains them only for a portion of
the Territory, and Supplier or an Affiliate later desires to offer
those distribution rights for the Territory or any portion thereof
to another party, Supplier shall first, or shall cause such
Affiliate to first, make that offer in writing to Distributor on
terms and conditions which shall be specified fully in that offer.
That offer shall contain a full description of the subject product
and its operation. Distributor may request, and Supplier shall
promptly provide, or shall cause such Affiliate promptly to
provide, further information concerning the product or the offer.
If Distributor fails to accept such offer, Supplier or the
Affiliate may then offer the product to another party for
distribution in the Territory, but may not offer it on terms and
conditions more favorable than those offered to Distributor. If
Supplier or the Affiliate desires to make a better offer to
another party, Supplier shall first, or shall cause the affiliate
first to, make such better offer to Distributor in accordance with
the procedure set forth above. Section 2.08. Distributor Sales,
Service and Storage Facilities. (a)   Distributor shall, at its
expense, engage and maintain a sales, service and parts handling
organization in the Territory, staffed with such experienced
personnel as are necessary to enable distributor to perform its
obligations under this Agreement. (b) Distributor shall, at its
expense, maintain facilities and personnel in the Territory that
will enable it promptly and satisfactorily to perform, at a
reasonable price, all inspection, maintenance and other necessary
servicing of Products sold by Distributor. To assist Distributor
in the discharge of this service and maintenance function,
Supplier shall provide service and maintenance training, without
charge, to any reasonable number of Distributor's personnel as
Distributor shall designate. (c) Distributor shall, at its
expense, at all times store and maintain its inventory of Products
in accordance with current, applicable instructions issued by
Supplier from time to time. (d) Distributor shall, at its expense,
deliver one copy of Supplier's current, applicable operation and
maintenance manual to each Customer at the time of sale and, at
that time, Distributor shall, at its expense, fully explain and
demonstrate to the customer the proper method of operating and
maintaining the Products. (e) Distributor shall mail to Supplier,

<h2>E-mail Policy - Landels, Ripley & Diamond</h2>
<PRE>
Contributor: Margaret Hart Edwards

Source: Labor, Employment & Employee Benefits Group

Firm: Landels, Ripley & Diamond, San Francisco and Sacramento
offices

Address: Hills Plaza

350 Steuart Street

San Francisco, California 94105-1250 

Telephone: (415) 788-5000

Fax: (415) 788-7550

Author caveat: This policy is a guideline only, as no one policy
that can fit all, or even most, employers. Each employer's e- mail
policy will be shaped by such individual factors as Company
culture, who uses the e-mail system, the capabili- ties of the
e-mail software program, including encryption, whether employees
are permitted to link their home comput- ers to the employer's
workplace network, and Company policies with regard to analogous
hard-paper storage. E- mail policies can be drafted to be more
restrictive or more protective of employee privacy rights. Any
specific policy should be drafted with the assistance of counsel
to make sure legal requirements are met.

*****

Sample E-Mail Policy

This policy describes XYZ Corporation's guidelines with regard to
access to and disclosure of electronic mail messages sent or
received by XYZ employees with use of the XYZ e-mail system.  XYZ
respects the individual privacy of its employees.  However,
employee privacy does not extend to the employee's work-related
conduct or to the use of Company-provided equipment or supplies.
You should be aware that the following guidelines may affect your
privacy in the workplace.

Management's Right to Access Information.  The electronic mail
system has been installed by XYZ to facilitate business
communications. Although each employee has an individual password
to access this system, it belongs to the Company and the contents
of e-mail communications are accessible at all times by XYZ
manage- ment for any business purpose. These systems may be
subject to periodic unannounced inspections, and should be treated
like other shared filing systems. All system passwords and
encryption keys must be available to Company management, and you
may not use passwords that are unknown to your supervisor or
install encryption programs without turning over encryption keys
to your supervisor. All e-mail messages are Company records. The
contents of e-mail, properly obtained for legitimate business
purposes, may be disclosed within the Company without your
permission. Therefore, you should not assume that messages are
confidential. Back-up copies of e-mail may be main- tained and
referenced for business and legal reasons.

Personal Use of E-Mail.
Because XYZ provides the electronic mail system to assist you in
the performance of your job, you should use it for official
Company business. Incidental and occasion- al personal use of
e-mail is permitted by XYZ, but these messages will be treated the
same as other messages. XYZ reserves the right to access and
disclose as necessary all messages sent over its e-mail system,
without regard to content. Since your personal messages can be
accessed by XYZ management without prior notice, you should not
use e-mail to transmit any messages you would not want read by a
third party. For example, you should not use the XYZ e-mail for
gossip, including personal information about yourself or others,
for forwarding messages under circumstances likely to embarrass
the sender, or for emotional responses to business correspondence
or work situations. In any event, you should not use these systems
for such purposes as soliciting or proselytizing for commercial
ventures, religious or personal causes or outside organizations or
other similar, non-job-related solicitations. If XYZ discovers
that you are misusing the e-mail system, you will be subject to
disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Forbidden Content of E-Mail Communications.  You may not use XYZ's
e-mail system in any way that may be seen as insulting,
disruptive, or offensive by other persons, or harmful to morale.
Examples of forbidden transmissions include sexually-explicit
messages, cartoons, or jokes; unwelcome propositions or love
letters; ethnic or racial slurs; or any other message that can be
construed to be harassment or disparagement of others based on
their sex, race, sexual orientation, age, national origin, or
religious or political beliefs. Use of the Company-provided e-mail
system in violation of this guideline will result in disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.

Password and Encryption Key Security and Integrity.  Employees are
prohibited from the unauthorized use of the passwords and
encryption keys of other employees to gain access to the other
employee's e-mail messages.

[Name and Address]

Re: Separation Agreement and General Release

Dear ______________________:

This letter proposes the following Separation Agreement and
General Release ("Agreement") between you and ________________
("Company") regarding the terms of your separation from
________________ .

I. Background

A.  You were employed by the Company as ____________. You and the
Company have agreed to terminate your employment relationship on
an amicable basis. 

B.  On ________, your employment with the Company terminated.

II. Terms of Agreement

In order to effect the termination of your employment and to
provide you with certain benefits that you would not otherwise be
entitled to, you and the Company agree as follows:

1. This Agreement shall not be in any way construed as an
admission by the Company that it has acted wrongfully with respect
to you or any other person, or that you have any rights whatsoever
against the Company.

2. Even if you do not sign this Agreement, the Company will pay
you the compensation that you have earned through the date of your
termination, any accrued vacation benefits, and [insert any
appropriate profit sharing, etc. plan name here] in accordance
with the terms and conditions of such plan. Similarly, even if you
do not sign this Agreement, you will be offered benefits to which
you are entitled under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA"), and you retain all benefits
under the Company's 401(k) Plan.

3. In exchange for the promises contained in this Agreement and
release of claims as set forth below, and provided that you sign
this agreement and return it to me by ________ [21 days from date
of letter], 1995 and do not revoke this Agreement as set forth in
Paragraph 15(d):

c. If you wish, the Company will pay for an outplacement service
(to be selected by the Company) for services rendered in assisting
you in locating another job, for a period of ____ months following
the date of your termination or until you begin working for
another employer, whichever occurs first. These payments are
contingent upon your cooperation with the outplacement service and
upon active efforts by you to locate another position.

4. In consideration of the promises contained in this Agreement,
you agree:

a. On behalf of yourself and anyone claiming through you,
irrevocably and unconditionally to release, acquit and forever
discharge the Company and/or its parent corporation, subsidiaries,
divisions, predecessors, successors and assigns, as well as each's
past and present officers, directors, employees, shareholders,
trustees, joint venturers, partners, and anyone claiming through
them (hereinafter "Releasees" collectively), in each's individual
and/or corporate capacities, from any and all claims, liabilities,
promises, actions, damages and the like, known or unknown, which
you ever had against any of the Releasees arising out of or
relating to your employment with the Company and/or the
termination of your employment with the Company. Said claims
include, but are not limited to: (1) employment discrimination
(including claims of sex discrimination and/or sexual harassment)
and retaliation under Title VII (42 U.S.C.A.   2000e etc.) and
under 42 U.S.C.A. section 1981 and section 1983, age
discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29
U.S.C.A. sections 621-634) as amended, under the California

("FEHA"), under the California Labor Code and/or any other
relevant state statutes or municipal ordinances; (2) disputed
wages; (3) wrongful discharge and/or breach of any alleged
employment contract; and (4) claims based on any tort, such as
invasion of privacy, defamation, fraud and infliction of emotional
distress.

b. That you shall not bring any legal action against any of the
Releasees for any claim waived and released under this Agreement
and that you represent and warrant that no such claim has been
filed to date. You further agree that should you bring any type of
administrative or legal action arising out of claims waived under
this Agreement, you will bear all legal fees and costs, including
those of the Releasees.

5. You agree to refer any and all reference checks to the
________ [insert name] and you know that any such references will
be limited to confirmation of your dates of employment and last
position held. The obligation under this Paragraph is separable
and any failure by the Company to perform the obligation in this
Paragraph will only give rise to an action to enforce this
Paragraph.

6. You agree that you will not, directly or indirectly, disclose
the fact of and terms of this Agreement, including the severance
benefits, to anyone other than your attorney, except to the extent

<P>[Editor's notes: This contribution is in three parts: first, an introduction explaining the Bar Association's methodology and intent, followed by guidelines, then a sample policy.]</P>

<H3>PART ONE: MEMORANDUM</h3>

<P>To: Board of Directors<br>
From: Joan Graff and Jamie Studley, Co-Chairs, Ad Hoc Committee on
Sexual Harassment<br>
Date: April 16, 1992<br> 
Re: Proposed Model Policy Guidelines and Sample Policy on Sexual
Harassment in Employment</P>

<H4>Introduction</h4>

<P>On December 13, 1992, at the request of then-President-elect James M. Seff, the Board of Directors passed a Resolution authorizing formation of an ad hoc committee to study and recommend for Board adoption and dissemination a model policy on sexual harassment in employment.</P>

<P>Joan Graff, Executive Director of the Legal Aid Society of San Francisco, and Jamie Studley, former Executive Director of the National Association for Law Placement, were appointed to co- chair the Committee. Representatives of California Women Lawyers, Queen's Bench, the San Francisco Women Lawyers Alliance, and legal secretaries' and legal assistants' associations were invited to join the Committee, and its formation, mandate and meeting times were announced and publicized in BASF publications. The resulting Committee included a cross-section of lawyers specializing in the representation of management in labor matters, labor lawyers, sex discrimination and employment discrimination litigators, and other interested persons. BASF President James Seff served as an active member of the Committee.</P>

<P>The Committee had the benefit of a carefully considered set of Policy Guidelines drafted by California Women Lawyers which, with various modifications, was adopted by the Committee and is attached as Attachment A. The Committee also determined that it would be helpful to provide employers with a Sample Policy to serve as a vehicle for development or modification of their own policies. Building on the recent work of the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession, entitled "Lawyers and Balanced Lives: A Guide to Drafting and Implementing Workplace Policies or Lawyers," a subcommittee chaired by Mark Schickmen, developed a Sample Policy which, with certain modifications, was adopted by the Committee.  (Attachment B)</P>

<h4>Committee Recommendations</h4>

<P>The Committee recommends that the Board adopt the enclosed Proposed Resolution (Attachment C), which (1) endorses the Policy Guidelines and Sample Policy; (2) mandates their distribution to the local and national legal community and to all BASF Sponsor Firms and Corporations, together with appropriate supporting materials; (3) authorizes an accompanying cover letter to Sponsors urging the adoption, in substance, of the Policy Guidelines and requesting their completion and return to the Association of a form signifying their adoption of a sexual harassment policy which incorporates the substance of the Guidelines (Attachments D and E); (4) offers small, mid-sized and large employers the technical assistance of the Committee in developing, amending and implementing sexual harassment policies; and, (5) authorizes periodic notice to legal employers, attorneys, law students, non-attorney legal employees, law placement offices and search firms, and the national law student community, of the names of employers which have adopted the substance of the Model Guidelines.</P>

<H4>The Problem of Sexual Harassment in the Legal Workplace</h4>

<P>Sexual harassment is a pervasive, severe, and debilitating phenomenon which increasingly has emerged as a matter of national concern. Studies of employees in Fortune 500 companies, government agencies and academia consistently demonstrate that a significant percentage of women and a small percentage of men have experienced some form of sexual harassment, and that the costs to both employees and employers are high. Yet there simultaneously exists a disturbing lack of understanding on the part of employers about the nature, extent and disastrous effects of sexual harassment.</P>

<P>Not surprisingly, recent studies have demonstrated that the legal profession is far from immune from either the depth of the problem or the inadequacy of the response. A comprehensive 1990 ABA Young Lawyers Division survey on attorney dissatisfaction, for example, revealed by 85% of female lawyers and 78% of male lawyers had experienced or observed at least one form of sexual harassment during the previous two years. Almost half of the women lawyers -- 46% -- had experienced or observed several different forms of sexual harassment during this period, while, interestingly, 68% of the male lawyers had observed more than one form of sexual harassment during this same time period.</P>

<P>A 1989 National Law Journal/West Publishing Company survey had earlier confirmed the prevalence of sexual harassment in the legal profession, revealing that 60% of the women partners and associates in the 250 largest firms in the nation reported experiencing sexual harassment at some point in their career. Here in California, nearly half of the women lawyers surveyed by the State Bar Committee on Women in the Law in 1989 reported experiencing sexual harassment at their present or previous job.</P>

<P>The costs of sexual harassment in the legal profession are high, particularly when measured against the fact that women now constitute well over 40% of the associates in large urban law firms. The costs to legal employers can be measured in terms of lost productivity and employee loyalty; injury to reputation; and the expenses entailed by employee turnover and retraining; as well as by the price of litigation and damages paid to successful complainants. Employees, of course, pay a much higher price, suffering major physical, economic, psychological, emotional and social consequences.</P>

<H4>The Need for Adoption and Implementation of Model Guidelines</h4>

<P>The Bar Association of San Francisco has long been a leader in efforts to eliminate barriers to the full and equal participation of women in the legal profession. BASF has historically acknowledged the special role that lawyers and the Association play in the eradication of sexual harassment and other forms of gender-based discrimination, in our own profession and in the greater community.</P>

<P>An increasing number of legal employers have adopted policies defining and prohibiting sexual harassment and setting forth procedures for filing and responding to complaints. The Association's adoption and dissemination of the proposed Policy Guidelines and Sample Policy will assist these and other employers in formulating, revising and enforcing policies that ensure that both women and men understand what constitutes sexual harassment, that procedures are available and are actually used for reporting, investigating and remedying incidents of harassment, and the two greatest barriers to the reporting of sexual harassment will be overcome: fear of reprisal and fear of loss of privacy.</P>

<P>The Committee intends to provide technical assistance to any requesting employer and to continue the work of a subcommittee that is currently studying ways in which the Association can best assist victims of sexual harassment in the San Francisco legal community.</P>

<H3>PART TWO: SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY GUIDELINES</h3>

<P>As members of the legal community, we are committed to ensuring that women and men have a work place free from sexual harassment and therefore recognize the need for all employers, including "legal employers," to have and enforce a sexual harassment policy. To assist in educating the legal profession, the judiciary, and society at large on the issue of sexual harassment, and to enhance the working environment for all persons, these guidelines are offered.</P>

<P>Sexual harassment policies should not only be written, but need to be implemented in a form that will prevent sexual harassment from occurring in the work place, educate employers and employees regarding their responsibilities and rights, improve morale, enhance professionalism, increase productivity, encourage victims of harassment to come forward and ensure that management takes prompt and effective corrective action to eradicate sexual harassment. Each employer will need to devise its own policy to meet its needs, size, condition, and other requirements.</P>

<H4>Definition of Sexual Harassment</h4>

<P>Sexual harassment is illegal sex discrimination and includes any unwelcome advances, requests for sexual favors and any other verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature which meets any one of the following three criteria:

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">

<LI>Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term condition or condition of the individual's employment;<p>

<LI>Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or<p>

<LI>Conduct which has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

</OL>

<P>In determining whether one of the above criteria is met, the standard to be applied is that of the reasonable victim of the same gender as the victim. For example, the perspective of a "reasonable female victim" should be applied when the victim is a woman.</P>

<P>It is no defense to a claim of sexual harassment that the alleged harasser did not intend to harass.</P>

<H4>Objectives of Sexual Harassment Policies</h4>

<P>An effective sexual harassment policy is one that:

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">

<LI>focuses on prevention;<p>

<LI>provides procedures for implementation, including a comprehensive educational and training program for all employees, including top management;<p>

<LI>encourages victims of sexual harassment to report the behavior by guaranteeing them protection against retaliation;<p>

<LI>ensures a commitment on the part of management to take prompt and effective disciplinary action against anyone who violates the policy; and<p>

<LI>includes multiple access points to the grievance process.

</OL>

<H4>Criteria for an Effective Sexual Harassment Policy</h4>

<P>Sexual harassment policies should generally include the following essential elements:

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">

<LI>A written sexual harassment policy statement, widely and effectively disseminated, that includes:<P>

	<OL TYPE=A START="1">

		<LI>an unequivocal statement that the employer will not tolerate, condone or allow sexual harassment by any owner, employee, manager, supervisor,  co-worker, client, customer, independent contractor, opposing counsel, court personnel or other non-employees who conduct business with the employer;<p>

		<LI>a statement that any management employee who believes sexual harassment may be occurring is required to report the conduct to the appropriate human resources or other management employee;<p>

		<LI>a definition of sexual harassment that includes specific examples of prohibited behavior, whether or not directed specifically to any individual. For example:<P>

		<OL TYPE=i START="1">

			<LI>Verbal: sexual innuendoes, suggestive or insulting comments or sounds, jokes teasing of a sexual nature, sexual propositions or threats, continuing to express personal interest after being informed the interest is unwelcome.<p>

			<LI>Visual: sexually suggestive objects, pictures, or letters; leering, whistling, or obscene gestures;<p>

			<LI>Physical: unwanted physical contact, including touching, pinching, brushing the body, impeding or blocking movement, sexual intercourse or assault.<p>

		</OL>

	</OL>

<LI>Procedures for implementation, including an educational and training program on the company's sexual harassment policies on an ongoing regular basis for all levels of employees.<p>

<LI>A complaint procedure that includes the following:<p>

	<OL TYPE=A START="1">

		<LI>the option of reporting any perceived sexual harassment to the employee's supervisor, other management person, or human resources representative;<p>

		<LI>measures to ensure reasonable confidentiality about the charge;<p>

		<LI>measures to ensure protection for the complainant or other participants in the complaint investigation from retaliation;<p>

		<LI>informing the complainant of her/his legal rights when a complaint of sexual harassment is made;<p>

		<LI>a prompt, thorough, and impartial investigation of the complaint;<p>

		<LI>informing the complainant of the results of the investigation and, if harassment is found, of the remedial options available through the employer.<p>

		<LI>appropriate disciplinary measures against any employee who violates the sexual harassment policy or retaliates against an employee who reports perceived sexual harassment, up to and including termination;<p>

		<LI>follow-up procedures to be sure subsequent acts of harassment or retaliation are not occurring.<p>

	</OL>

<LI>Procedures for preventing and acting against known or suspected harassment, whether or not a complaint has been filed.

</OL>

<H3>PART THREE: SAMPLE POLICY</H3>

<P>The following sample policy is intended to serve as a guideline to individuals in developing a sexual harassment policy for their workplace. In drafting an effective policy, individuals should take into consideration the unique characteristics and culture of their workplace. Small law offices are encouraged to adapt the policy to accommodate their own particular size and structure. We hope the sample policy will serve as a useful starting point for lawyers who are interested in drafting and implementing a sexual harassment policy.</P>

SAMPLE

Firm Statement of Philosophy

(Employer Name) is proud of its tradition of a collegial work
environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and
dignity. Each individual has the right to work in a professional
atmosphere which promotes equal opportunities and prohibits
discriminatory practices, including sexual harassment. At
(Employer Name) sexual harassment, whether verbal, physical or
environmental, is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.
([Managing Partner/General Counsel/CEO] letter committing to the
policy should be attached.)

Definition of Sexual Harassment

For purposes of this policy, sexual harassment is defined as
unwelcome or unwanted advances, requests for sexual favors and any
other verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
(1) submission to or rejection of this conduct by an individual is
used as a factor in decisions affecting hiring, evaluation,
retention, promotion or other aspects of employment; or (2) this
conduct substantially interferes with an individual's employment
or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.

Examples of sexual harassment may include, but are not limited to:

unwanted sexual advances;

demands for sexual favors in exchange for favorable treatment or
continued employment;

threats and demands to submit to sexual requests in order to
obtain or retain any employment benefit;

verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory or obscene comments,
slurs or sexual invitations, sexual jokes, propositions,
suggestive, insulting, obscene comments or gestures or other
verbal abuse of a sexual nature;

graphic, verbal commentary about an individual's body, sexual
prowess or sexual deficiencies;

flirtations, advances, leering, whistling, touching, pinching,
assault, coerced sexual acts, blocking normal movements;

visual conduct such as derogatory or sexual posters, photographs,
cartoons, drawings or gestures or other displays in the work place
of sexually suggestive objects or pictures;

conduct or comments consistently targeted at only one gender, even
if the content is not sexual;

retaliation for having reported or threatened to report sexual
harassment.

This behavior is unacceptable in the workplace itself and in other
work-related settings such as business trips, court appearances
and business-related social events. In evaluating behavior, the
standard to be applied is that of a reasonable victim of the same
gender as the victim.

DISSEMINATION OF POLICY

This policy will be disseminated to all employees, and its
existence will be displayed prominently at the place of
employment. All supervisors are responsible for knowing of its
existence and substance, and of their responsibility for its
implementation. The Human Resources Director will be available to
answer all questions about the policy, or its implementation.

Individuals Covered Under the Policy

This policy covers all individuals in the workplace (including
associates, paralegals, support staff and partners). (Employer
Name) will not tolerate, condone or allow sexual harassment,
whether engaged in by fellow employees, supervisors, associates,
partners or by outside clients, opposing counsel, court personnel
or other non-employees who conduct business with this employer.
The employer encourages reporting of all incidents of sexual
harassment, regardless of who the offender may be, or of the
offender's relationship to the firm.

Reporting a Complaint

While (Employer Name) encourages individuals who believe they are
being harassed to firmly and promptly notify the offender that his
or her behavior is unwelcome, the employer also recognizes that
power and status disparities between an alleged harasser and a
target may make such a confrontation impossible. In the event that
such informal, direct communication between individuals is either
ineffective or impossible, the following steps should be followed
in reporting a sexual harassment complaint.

1. Notification of Appropriate Staff

Individuals who believe they have been subjected to sexual
harassment should report the incident to any member of the
committee listed below. (The employer should designate a group of
individuals within the employer who may receive complaints. These
should be individuals of both genders, drawn from a variety of age
groups, job positions and levels of seniority.)

An individual also may choose to report the complaint to his/her
supervisor. If the supervisor successfully resolves the complaint
in an informal manner to the complainant's satisfaction, the
supervisor must file a confidential report to (employer management
or designated individual) about the complaint and resolution so
that the employer will be aware of any pattern of harassment by a
particular individual and will also be aware of all complaints of
sexual harassment on an employer-wide basis. If the supervisor
does not successfully resolve the complaint informally, manner, a
written report must be made to [the personnel director] within one
work day. A supervisor who has not had special training in dealing
with sexual harassment complaints is strongly encouraged to
consult a trained member of the employer's sexual harassment
committee before taking action.

2. Description of Misconduct

An accurate record of objectionable behavior or misconduct is
needed to resolve a formal complain of sexual harassment.

Verbal reports of sexual harassment must be reduced to writing by
either the complainant or the individual(s) designated to receive
complaints, and must be signed by the complainant. Individuals who
believe that they have been or are currently being harassed,
should maintain a record of objectionable conduct in order to
prepare effectively and substantiate their allegations.

While (Employer Name) encourages individuals to keep written notes
in order to accurately record offensive conduct or behavior, the
employer hereby notifies all employees that, in the event that a
lawsuit develops from the reported incident, the complainant's
written notes might not be considered privileged or confidential
information.

3. Timeframe for Reporting Complaint

(Employer Name) encourages a prompt reporting of complaints so
that rapid response and appropriate action may be taken. This
policy not only aids the complainant, but also helps to maintain
an environment free from discrimination for all employees.
Employees should also be aware of the time limits imposed by
local, state and national governmental agencies for the filing of
complaints of harassment or discrimination; those time limits are
posted on the official notices which are prominently displayed
(list location).

Investigating the Complaint

1. Confidentiality

Any allegation of sexual harassment brought to the attention of
(the employer's appointed committee) will be promptly
investigated. Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the
investigatory process to the extent practical and appropriate
under the circumstances.

2. Identification of Investigators

Complaints will be investigated and resolved by the employer's
sexual harassment committee. In addition, any of the following
individuals may be included in reviewing the investigation and
outcome: (list may include a number of appropriate partners, other
members of the sexual harassment committee or other individuals
such as the Director of Human Resources).

3. Investigation Process

In pursuing the investigation, the investigator will try to take
the wishes of the complainant under consideration, but will
thoroughly investigate the matter, keeping the complainant
informed as to the status of the investigation. Steps to be taken
in the investigation include:

Confirm name and position of the complainant.

Identify the alleged harasser.

Thoroughly ascertain all facts that explain what happened.
Questions should be asked in a non-judgmental manner.

Determine frequency/type of alleged harassment and, if possible,
the dates and locations where alleged harassment occurred.

Find out if there were witnesses who observed the alleged
harassment.

Ask the individual how he/she responded to the alleged harassment.

Develop a thorough understanding of the professional relationship,
degree of control and amount of interaction between the alleged
harasser and complainant. (Does the person control compensation,
terms of employment or promotions? Do these individuals work in
close proximity to one another and/or on the same projects?

Determine whether the alleged harasser has carried out any threats
or promises directed at the complainant.

Does the complainant know of or suspect that there are other
individuals who have been harassed by the alleged harasser?

Has the complainant informed other partners or supervisors of the
situation? What response, if any, did complainant receive from
these individuals?

Ask complainant what action he/she would like the employer to take
as a consequence of the harassment.

When first interviewing the alleged harasser, remind him/her of
the employer's policy against retaliation for making a complaint
of sexual harassment.

Resolving the Complaint

In order to minimize the damage to the firm, the complainant and
the alleged harasser to the full extent possible, (Employer Name)
will complete the investigation of a sexual harassment complaint
and will communicate its findings and intended actions to the
complainant and alleged harasser as expeditiously as possible.

If the investigator, [together with review committee], finds that
harassment occurred, the harasser will be subject to appropriate
disciplinary procedures, as listed below. The complainant will be
informed of the disciplinary action taken.

If the investigator, [together with a review committee],
determines that no sexual harassment has occurred, this finding
will be communicated to the complainant in an appropriately
sensitive manner.

If the investigator [together with review committee] cannot
determine whether or not sexual harassment has occurred, this
finding will be communicated to the complainant and the alleged
harasser, and the matter will be recorded as unresolved. Both the
complainant and the alleged harasser will be informed again of the
procedures set forth in this sexual harassment policy, including
the appeal process contained below.

In the event that no resolution satisfactory to both parties can
be reached based on the initial investigation, the matter shall be
referred to (name an appropriate individual or group, such as the
Managing Partner or Excessive Committee or Director of Human
Resources). See "Appeals Process" below.

1. Sanctions

Individuals found to have engaged in misconduct constituting
sexual harassment will be severely disciplined, up to and
including discharge. Appropriate sanctions will be determined by
(select the appropriate individual or group of individuals). In
addressing incidents of sexual harassment, the employer's response
at a minimum will include reprimanding the offender and preparing
a written record. Additional action may  include: referral to
counseling, withholding of a promotion, reassignment, temporary
suspension without pay, financial penalties or termination.

This policy is designed to protect all employees from harassment
in any way associated with the workplace or work environment, no
matter who the harasser is.

Although the employer's ability to discipline a non-employee
harasser (e.g. client, opposing counsel, supplier, or court
officials) may be limited by the degree of control, if any, that
the employer has over the alleged harasser, any employee or
partner who has been subjected to sexual harassment should file a
complaint and be assured that action will be taken. Such action
may include closing business with a client, reporting a client
contact to his or her employer, reporting a public official to an
appropriate agency, or any other appropriate action to protect
employees.

2. Appeal Process

If any party directly involved in a sexual harassment
investigation is dissatisfied with the outcome or resolution, that
individual has the right to appeal the decision. The dissatisfied
party should submit his/her written comments in a timely manner to
(select the appropriate reviewers; individual or group of
individuals, e.g. Administrative Partners of the employer).

Maintaining a Written Report of the Complaint

The employer shall maintain a complete written record of each
complaint and how it was investigated and resolved. Written
records shall be maintained in a confidential manner in the office
of (name the appropriate individual or appropriate division within
the office). The keeper of the records may vary depending on who
filed the complaint - associate, partner, paralegal,
administrative assistant, etc.

Written records will be maintained for 5 years from the date of
the resolution unless new circumstances dictate that the file
should be kept for a longer period of time.

Protection Against Retaliation

The employer will not in any way retaliate against an individual
who makes a complaint of sexual harassment or against any
participant in the investigation, nor permit any partner or
employee to do so. Retaliation is a serious violation of this
sexual harassment policy and should be reported immediately. Any
person found to have retaliated against another individual for
reporting sexual harassment will be subject to the same
disciplinary action provided for sexual harassment offenders (see
"Resolving the Complaint" above).

Formal Legal Proceedings

The procedures above apply to internal complaints of harassment.
Different procedures apply after a formal governmental
administrative charge or civil lawsuit is filed. If you receive
such a charge or complaint, you are directed to deliver it to [the
personal director] immediately, all responses to such a formal
charge or complaint will be made through [the personnel director].
RETALIATION AGAINST ANY PERSON WHO FILES A FORMAL CHARGE OR
COMPLAINT OF HARASSMENT IS PROHIBITED, AND IS GROUNDS FOR
DISCIPLINE UP TO AND INCLUDING TERMINATION.

Conclusion

(Employer Name) has developed this policy to ensure that all its
employees and partners can work in an environment free from sexual
harassment. The employer will make every effort to ensure that all
personnel are familiar with the policy and know that any complaint
received will be thoroughly investigated and appropriately
resolved.</pre>

<H3>Policy on Sexual and Other Unlawful Harassment (Approved by The President's Cabinet May 1991)</H3>

<H3>A. POLICY ISSUES</H3>

<H4>1. Purpose</H4>

<P>The purpose of this policy is to state clearly and unequivocally that the University prohibits sexual, racial and other forms of unlawful harassment by its faculty, staff and students. The University of San Francisco is committed to providing faculty, staff and students a work and academic environment free of sexual and other unlawful harassment. The University maintains a strict policy prohibiting harassment on the basis of sex, race, religion, color, national origin, disability, medical condition (cancer- related), marital status, age, sexual orientation, or any other basis protected by federal, state or local ordinance or regulation.  All such harassment is unlawful.</P>

<H4>2. Policy</H4>

<P>It is the policy of the University that sexual and other unlawful harassment will not be tolerated.  In addition, false accusations of such harassment will not be tolerated.  It is the policy of the University to (1) provide a harassment complaint procedure to review and act upon complaints of unlawful harassment; (2) thoroughly investigate in a timely manner complaints of unlawful harassment; (3) protect the rights and confidentiality of all parties to the harassment allegations to the extent possible; and (4) prevent retaliation against persons alleging sexual and other unlawful harassment or persons cooperating in an investigation. It is the intention of the University to take whatever action may be needed to prevent, correct, and, if necessary, discipline to the extent of dismissal from University employment or expulsion from the University, behavior which violates this policy. Wherever an instance of unlawful harassment, knowingly false accusation, reprisal for reporting or threatening to report unlawful harassment has been documented by evidence, appropriate disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or expulsion from the University will be taken consistent with applicable federal, state and local laws, University employment and academic policies, and collective bargaining agreements.</P>

<H4>3. Application</H4>

<P>This policy applies to University faculty, staff and students involved in any employment and/or academic relationship at the University.  Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are subject to their own policies and procedures related to sexual and other unlawful harassment because of collective bargaining agreements.</P>

<H4>4. Definitions</H4>

<H4>A. Sexual Harassment</H4>

<P>Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: 1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or status in a program, course, or activity; or 2. submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment or educational decisions affecting an individual; or  3. such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work or educational performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work or educational environment.</P>

<P>Examples:</P>

<P>Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory comments, slurs or unwanted or unwelcome sexual advances, invitations or comments. Visual conduct such as derogatory or sexually explicit posters, photography, cartoons, drawings or gestures. Physical conduct such as unwanted or unwelcome touching, blocking normal movement or interfering with work directed at the individual because of his or her sex or race or any other protected basis. Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests in order to keep an individual's job or receive a grade and offers of job or educational benefits in return for sexual favors. Two types of sexual and other unlawful harassment exist: Quid pro quo cases are those cases in which the employee or student suffers or reasonably believes he/she will suffer a tangible job or educational detriment in retaliation for refusing to accede to sexual demands. Hostile environment cases are those cases in which no tangible loss or detriment occurs, but an offensive or abusive atmosphere is created by the harasser.</P>

<H4>B. Other Unlawful Harassment</H4>

<P>Unlawful harassment consists of unwelcome statements or actions that are sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to interfere with an individual's work performance or create an intimidating, hostile or offensive work or academic environment based on sex, race, religion, color, national origin, disability, medical condition(cancer-related), marital status, age, sexual orientation, or other protected group status.</P>

<H4>5. Retaliation Prohibited</H4>

<P>Retaliation by anyone in the University Community against a member of the University Community as a result of his or her seeking redress under this policy, (e.g. informal or formal complaints about harassment, cooperating in an investigation, or otherwise participating in proceedings under this policy) is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge from University employment/dismissal or expulsion from the University.</P>

<H4>6. Confidentiality</H4>

<P>Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect the privacy of the complainant and the alleged harasser in the investigation and resolution process, subject to the need to conduct a full and impartial investigation, remedy violations, monitor compliance and administer this policy.</P>

<H3>B. PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES FOR ADDRESSING COMPLAINTS OF  SEXUAL AND OTHER UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT</H3>

<P>The University has established a sexual and other unlawful harassment complaint procedure to encourage employees and students covered by this policy to seek redress for sexual or other unlawful harassment. This procedure applies to all complaints of sexual or other unlawful harassment. Informal Complaint Procedure The complainant has up to 180 days after the alleged incident(s) to make a complaint.</P>

<H2>About the Legal Helpline</H2>

<P>We're pleased to welcome you to the Legal Helpline, our new service that gives non-lawyers a place to ask experienced attorneys for information about everyday legal situations.</P>

<P>It's important that you understand that the Legal Helpline won't be a substitute for hiring a lawyer to represent you or give you advice about your particular situation. But it is a great way to get background on legal issues that affect your life, learn about the law and the justice system, and help you decide whether you need a lawyer and what to ask the lawyer if you hire one.</P>

<P>Submit your question through our e-mail submission form, and it will be answered by <A HREF="/legalhelp/helpline/panelists.html">members</A> of the Law Center Bar Association. These are lawyers who are also members of <A HREF="http://www.counsel.com/inside/">Counsel Connect</A>, the largest online service exclusively for lawyers, and have agreed to make themselves available to you.</P>

<P>You'll probably see a lot of postings from Parry Aftab, the host of the Court TV Law Center Legal Helpline. Parry is a lawyer in New Jersey and New York who has been hosting online legal discussions for several years, and we're lucky to have her.</P>

<P>If you are a lawyer and would like to join the LCBA, please e-mail Court TV Law Center Editor Craig Matters at <A HREF="mailto:comments@courttv.com">comments@courttv.com</A>.</P>

<P>We hope you find the Legal Helpline useful. If you have comments or criticisms, please <A HREF="/comments/">let us know</A>.</P>

<H2>Legal Helpline Guidelines</H2>

<P>There are a few guidelines we ask you to follow in asking questions. These rules may sound strict, but they're for your protection and for the benefit of the online community. We want to make sure that using the Legal Helpline is a beneficial and valuable experience, that it doesn't in any way jeopardize any relationships you may create with a lawyer you hire to represent you, and that it gives useful information to others who will read your question and the resulting answer.</P>

<P>Questions must be general and must not include detailed facts about your specific case. We want everyone to learn from the inquiries sent to the Legal Helpline. Our panelists would not be able to answer a question about whether your neighbor can prove that the property line is three feet to the north or three feet to the south, for example. But they could explain how property line disputes with neighbors are generally resolved.</P>

<P>If you have any questions about how to phrase your question, please e-mail our Legal Helpline editor at <A HREF="mailto:legalhelp@counsel.com">legalhelp@counsel.com</A>. We'll work with you to help you to phrase your query so that it meets our editorial guidelines, and so that it will yield a response that will be helpful to all our users. If your question is inappropriately phrased, we may contact you for additional information.</P>

How much cash do I need to have?</h3><blockquote>That depends on the kind of business you're starting. Start-up capital for a consulting business you intend to run out of your home will require far less cash initially than opening a store or manufacturing a product.<P>As a rule of thumb, if you're starting a home-based business, you should have at least six months of working capital for the business plus at least six months of living expenses for yourself and your family. Other small businesses may require one to two years (or longer) before they reasonably can be expected to break even. <P>More start-up businesses fail for want of capital than for any other reason. You need to be realistic about what the business will need to get going and what sacrifices you are willing to make from a personal financial standpoint. Before you start your business, it is a very good idea to pay down (or off) as much personal household debt as you can, then put yourself on a budget and stick with it. <a name=invest></blockquote></a><h3>2. I have a friend who wants to invest in my new business. What should I consider?</h3><blockquote>First, you need to think about the role this friend wants to take in the business. Does she want to participate in the development of the business or is she a passive investor? Is he look for an income stream or is he willing to wait for long-term growth?<P>Whenever people deal with friends or family in this context, they tend to make certain assumptions about the reasons for such an investment and not ask necessary questions. You may believe that a family member just wants to help you out financially, while he or she envisions a more active role in the running of the enterprise. <P>You need to talk about these expectations up front -- <I>before</I> the investment is made -- and you must articulate your mutual understanding in writing. A formal agreement is very desirable in these situations and is absolutely essential if the investment is actually a loan. The writing serves to formalize the relationship as it affects the business. It sets up the boundaries, so to speak, and gives each of you a framework for going forward.<P>Another point your friendly investors should consider is that if down the line you need additional working capital from third parties, you and your investors will likely have to subordinate your respective financial interests in the business to those of the third party, or you may be required to guarantee financial obligations. If you expect to seek outside capital at some point, as either a loan or additional capital, you should get your friendly investors to agree ahead of time to subordinate their interests in such circumstances and assess their willingness to guarantee obligations.<a name=borrow></blockquote></a><h3>3. I need to borrow money. Where do I start?</h3><blockquote>You need to look at your own resources (and those of interested family and friends) before you apply for any loans. Any lender is going to look for a significant personal financial commitment on your part as an indication of your belief that the proposed business will be successful.<P>Next, you should spend some time with the bank officer at your bank. While many commercial banks do not lend money to start-up businesses, some have developed special small business lending programs. While you may not yet have the track record to qualify for such loans, it is important to start the relationship with your banker early and to understand the bank's lending criteria so you can put yourself in a position to qualify later on. Your banker may also be able to get you credit lines based on the strength of your personal assets, which may give you a relatively fast way of getting cash. <P>Your banker can also help you find alternate financing. The best way to find business financing -- like a good job -- is through networking. Talk with professionals who serve the small business community, such as small business accountants, lawyers, etc., to scout out possible financing sources. Talk with other business owners in your industry about how they got their financing. Do your homework. Go to your local library for information. Contact professional organizations in your industry for guidance. Try the Small Business Administration, but don't neglect state and local small enterprise support programs. Find out what's available and determine whether you qualify. <P>Because lenders have varying criteria for making a loan, you'll want to have several proposals or applications going at the same time. It will help you comparison shop and may give you some negotiating leverage, but most important it will keep you on track if one of your potential lenders falls by the wayside. Once you have your financing, continue to network in this area. If your business is successful, you may outgrow your current financing arrangement and need a larger, more flexible facility. <a name=write></blockquote></a><h3>4. Do I need to write a business plan?</h3><blockquote>Yes. Even if you can wholly self-finance your new business, you need to plan where you want to go and how you intend to get there. You need a marketing plan to keep you focused and a financial plan to keep you on track. An accounting professional can help you develop a plan and assist you in preparing the formal business plan that most third-party lenders will require. </P><P><B>Any answers posted are for your information only and are not intended toconstitute legal advice.</B></P></blockquote><P><a href=/legalhelp/qanda/mcmorries.html><B><I>Main Page</I></B></a><P><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/stroke.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=547><BR><A HREF="/map/bottom.map"><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/bottom.gif" ISMAP ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM BORDER=0 WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=30></A><BR><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/rights.gif" ALT="Copyright 1995 by the Courtroom Television Network.

What do I need to think about now?</a></ol></P><a name=one><P></a><h3>1. Should I form a corporation or a partnership?</h3><blockquote>Deciding on the legal form for your new business venture is a highly individualized process. If you are on your own, your choices are generally either sole proprietorship or incorporation. If others are investing in the business, you can set up as a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, or limited liability company. [The <a href=/legalhelp/business/organization/>Court TV Legal Survival Guide</a> has good explanations of each of these forms.] Each form of ownership has pros and cons, as well as tax considerations that you will need to evaluate. I strongly suggest that you seek the advice of a good tax accountant and a lawyer to help you sort through the legal and tax implications of each. <a name=two></blockquote></a><h3>2. What kinds of records will I need to keep?</h3><blockquote>Recordkeeping is often neglected in the excitement of starting up a business, and thus it tends to get done haphazardly. If you think about recordkeeping before you start you business, you can save yourself untold hours of administrative time later on (when you can least afford the time). Much of your recordkeeping can be done on your personal computer. By thinking about the types of information you will want to manage and keep track of, you can select software packages that work well together. <P>Your accountant can help you set up your financial records so that pulling together your financial business plan won't seem like such a chore. On the non-financial end, the type of records you will need to maintain will depend on the type of business you are starting. It's probably a good idea to err on the side of overkill, at least in the beginning. Ask yourself this: If I were going to buy this business, what information would I want to see before I bought it to understand whether it's a good business? The answer should help you figure out the kind of information you're going to want to keep track of. <a name=three></blockquote></a><h3>3. How far ahead do I need to plan? </h3><blockquote>Again, the answer depends on what kind of business you're starting. Most established businesses use the budgeting process to develop their annual operating plans. These can be projected out three and five years, using assumptions about new products or services, expansion of markets, etc. (The further you go, however, the less reliable the plan becomes.) As a start-up, you should have a solid financial plan for at least a year or to your financial break-even point, whichever is longer. Beyond that, you should be thinking about where you want to go and developing a realistic approach for getting there. Putting such a plan in writing helps you stay on track.<a name=four></blockquote></a><h3>4. I know I'll need to hire people to help me. What do I need to think about now? </h3><blockquote>Whether and when to hire employees will again depend largely on the type of business you are starting. The old maxim  "staff for the lean times" is especially true for start-ups. It is far easier -- financially, emotionally and legally -- to hire people than to lay them off. In the beginning, you just don't know whether a flurry of activity is just that -- a flurry -- or a happy bellweather of things to come. <P>Many established businesses are rationalizing (i.e. reducing) their work forces and outsourcing the jobs they used to keep on the payroll. Using temporary workers or independent contractors initially can help you manage your overhead better and give you access to an experienced pool of workers. Over time, you can do the necessary financial figuring to see if hiring someone makes sense. </blockquote><P><a href=/legalhelp/qanda/mcmorries.html><B><I>Main Page</I></B></a><P><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/stroke.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=547><BR><A HREF="/map/bottom.map"><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/bottom.gif" ISMAP ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM BORDER=0 WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=30></A><BR><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/rights.gif" ALT="Copyright 1995 by the Courtroom Television Network.

How do I make sure that no one steals my ideas?  </h3><blockquote>Virtually every business is going to have some type of unique information. Whether it is the kind of information that is legally protectable depends on a number of factors. For example, you may have a way of doing something or an invention that can only be commercially exploitable if potential users find out about it. Such information may be protectable under the U.S. copyright or patent laws. These laws protect your materials or inventions from being copied by others for a period of time. <P>There may be other things -- such as a formula or a processing method -- which you may not need to disclose to exploit commercially. Its value is in the fact that you possess the secret. Many states have what are known as trade secret laws, which protect such material under certain circumstances. And there are other materials that are not, strictly speaking, trade secrets, but nevertheless are things you want to keep confidential. <P>If proprietary information and ideas are a significant part of your new business, you should talk to a lawyer who is familiar with intellectual property and trade secret laws to help you take the necessary steps to protect this information.  <a name=two></blockquote></a><h3>2. I'm investing with my brother. What happens if we find we can't work together? </h3><blockquote>When going into business with other people, it's important to think about what could go wrong and have a plan for dealing with it. The best time to decide these points is before you get started. While it may seem odd to talk about and think about what will happen if your new venture goes sour, these type of discussions can help you and your partner or business associate articulate your respective expectations for the business. In fact, how these discussions go can give you a perspective on how well you will be able to work and communicate with one another. <P>But don't stop with discussions. Once you have both decided what will happen to the business if things don't work, you need to have an agreement that spells these points out. The form of this agreement will depend on the type of legal entity you decided to use. You should consult a lawyer for assistance, not just to memorialize your agreement, but to raise points that may not have occurred to you. <a name=three></blockquote></a><h3>3. I'm hiring three people for my new business. Do I need to get them to sign anything when they start? </h3><blockquote>Your new employees will need to complete a number of forms for the IRS. Aside from that, before you hire them, you should think about whether they'll have access to proprietary information. If they will, you may want them to sign confidentiality agreements to protect your trade secrets and other confidential information. Depending on their duties, the industry in which you are operating and other factors, you may want to have them execute an employment contract. [See our recent workshop <a href=/seminars/handbook/>The Ultimate Employee Handbook</a> for discussion of the pros and cons of employment contracts.]<P>If your business plan calls for hiring more than a few employees, you should consider preparing an employment policy and procedures manual, as well as instituting formal employment practices. While much of employment law is governed by federal law, a lot of the employer-employee relationship is governed by state law. You should consult an attorney familiar with these laws to help you design your policies and procedures. You will need specialized help to set up any benefit plans, such as health insurance, retirement plans, etc. <a name=four></blockquote></a><h3>4. I have a logo and want to make sure that no one else will use it. What do I do? </h3><blockquote>Logos and other identifying names for a product or service are covered by federal trademark laws. Strictly speaking, a trademark is a word used to identify a product produced by a specific maker, such as Kleenex (R) facial tissue or Xerox (R) copiers. A service mark does the same for a service, such as Century 21(R) Realtors. Symbols and logos may also be trademarks and service marks if they serve to identify the provider. The Rock of Gibraltar drawing used by Prudential Insurance is one example. <P>If you have an identifying mark for a product or service, you should consult with a trademark lawyer for help making the necessary filings with the U.S. Trademark Office to protect your mark.  </blockquote><P><a href=/legalhelp/qanda/mcmorries.html><B><I>Main Page</I></B></a><P><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/stroke.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=547><BR><A HREF="/map/bottom.map"><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/bottom.gif" ISMAP ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM BORDER=0 WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=30></A><BR><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/rights.gif" ALT="Copyright 1995 by the Courtroom Television Network.

How much research should I do on my industry?</h3><blockquote>You should know as much about your industry as you can. The better informed you are about your industry, the better you'll be able to spot trends and capitalize on them. You will also understand who your competitors are -- both your real competitors and perceived competitors -- and will be able to distinguish yourself from them when it comes time to sell to a prospect. <P>Your research will also help you develop your business plan by injecting the necessary element of realism into the assumptions you include. Thorough knowledge of your industry will give you credibility with your prospective clients and customers, vendors, collateral businesses and, most important, the financial community.<P>Industry knowledge is the backbone of product or service development. Your new business should fill an identified need in your chosen market. You may have a "gut" feel for what is needed, but research can confirm this intuitive sense and help you refine the offering. <a name=two></blockquote></a><h3>2. I think my business has the potential to be a nationwide success, but I don't want to bite off more than I can chew at first. How do I decide where and how to focus? </h3><blockquote>Unless you are dealing with a "fad" product that requires mass market penetration quickly to capitalize on the fad, you should live by the story of the tortoise and the hare: Slow and steady wins the race. While widespread market acceptance can be exciting and gratifying, it can backfire if you are unable to meet customer demand for your product or service due to financial, facilities, manpower or capacity constraints. Where and how to focus your business should be the foundation of your business plan. <P>Established businesses spend a lot of resources on new product development and testing to give their product or service the best chance for widespread acceptance. Since you may not have the luxury of conducting significant test marketing, your best bet is to start with the markets that you know best. And don't just think in terms of geography. You can target a particular market segment or a particular distribution channel at the outset. Based on the reaction you get in these initial efforts, you can come up with an orderly, realistic plan for expansion.<a name=three></blockquote></a><h3>3. I am considering selling my product through independent sales representatives. What issues should I be concerned about? What kind of agreement do I need to draw up?</h3><blockquote>Independent sales representatives can be a cost-effective way of selling your product. Some rep groups are regional, others national. They are often confused with distributors. The difference usually is that a distributor buys your product and then sells it to the end user. A sales representative acts like a salesperson you have employed. Sales reps don't actually buy your product -- they act on your behalf to sell it to the end user. They are usually on commission. <P>You should research these groups before you contact them. If possible, talk to businesses that have used them to get a feel for how you think they may handle your product. You'll want to think about compensation and commission structure, sales targets, representing competing products, etc. Most rep groups have standard contracts they will want you to sign. You should have these reviewed by legal counsel and make changes that you feel will be in your best interest. <a name=four></blockquote></a><h3>4. I am afraid that I will feel isolated once I go out on my own. What can I do to keep myself up to date?</h3><blockquote>Stay active in any professional or trade groups are associated with your industry. Develop contacts at collateral businesses. Join any local small business forums or groups. Become active in the online community by reading and participating in online mailing lists, discussion groups, etc. In other words, network, network, network. It will help you stay in touch, keep up to date, spot trends, and sell yourself and your business. Good luck! </blockquote><P><a href=/legalhelp/qanda/mcmorries.html><B><I>Main Page</I></B></a><P><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/stroke.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=547><BR><A HREF="/map/bottom.map"><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/bottom.gif" ISMAP ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM BORDER=0 WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=30></A><BR><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/rights.gif" ALT="Copyright 1995 by the Courtroom Television Network.

<UL>
<LI>writings

<LI>software

<LI>photographs 

<LI>films

<LI>videotapes

<LI>recordings 

<LI>artworks
</UL>

<P>Ideas by themselves cannot be copyrighted. But the expression of ideas in your own way is what copyright protection is all about.</P>

<P>Your work is protected by copyright -- or copyrighted -- as soon as you create it. No application is required. Indeed, no application is permitted on the state level. The only registration available is on the federal level with the <A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">United States Copyright Office</A> of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. You will need this registration if you want to be able to enforce your copyright in federal court, which is the only place you can sue for copyright infringement.</P>

<P>Whether or not it's registered, a copyright lasts for the life of the author or artist, plus 50 years. If the owner of the copyright is an employer or corporation (a newspaper publisher, for example) the copyright lasts for 100 years from the creation of the work or 75 years from its publication, whichever is earlier.</P>

<P>Because it may be impossible to prove that something has been copied, copyright infringement is often determined by evaluating whether or not there is a substantial similarity between two works. There are no hard rules about what constitutes a substantial similarity. It is generally determined by the courts on a case by case basis.</P>

<P>A copyright does not completely prevent someone from using your work. Portions of a copyrighted work can be used without infringing the owner's rights if the use is considered a fair use. Fair use may include uses for:

<UL>
<LI>educational purposes

<LI>literary or social criticism 

<LI>activities like news reporting, which is protected by the First Amendment right to free speech  
</UL>

<P>Whether a use is fair or not depends on the answers to four questions:

<UL>
<LI> What is the purpose and character of the use of the material? The more for a public purpose and the less for a commercial purpose, the more likely the use is fair.<P>

<LI> What is the nature of the copyrighted work? The more it is a compilation of facts rather than a work of literature, the more leeway you will have to use a portion of it.<P>

<LI> What proportion of the copyrighted work is being used, both qualitatively and quantitatively? The less the better.<P>

<LI> What is the economic impact of the use of the work? The less profit the copyright owner loses, the more acceptable the use. 
</UL>

<P>The question of whether the use of copyrighted material is fair depends on the facts of each specific use. Say, for example, that a high school social studies teacher want to use information from three separate publications: a history textbook, a magazine, and a government booklet. She can probably copy the government publication as many times as she wants.</P>

<P>The magazine article is more problematic. While the teacher can probably make a copy for herself, she begins to move beyond the zone of fair use if she makes copies for all the students in her class, even if it's for educational purposes. The magazine's publishers would want and expect her to buy a copy for each of her students (or ask them to buy it for themselves). Or they might be willing to let her make copies -- for a reasonable reprint fee. </P>

<P>Copying from the textbook is pretty clearly a violation of the copyright -- especially if it was written for teaching at the level of the teacher's class. By copying and distributing portions of the book to her students, the teacher effectively is depriving the textbook writer of royalties on a work intended precisely for the commercial purpose the teacher is putting it to -- education of students.</P>

<H4>How To Register A Copyright</H4>

<P>Registering a copyright is relatively easy. The Library of Congress has a <A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">Copyright Office</A>, which provides a simple form. You can get one by calling 202-707-3000. In addition to filling out and submitting the form, you have to send a copy of your work and pay a nominal fee. </P>

<P>You don't need a lawyer to register a copyright, though if it's your first time you may want help. If you have any concerns about the ownership of the copyright (say you worked on the project with another author, for example, or you're not sure whether it's owned by you or your employer) or the extent to which you have the right to use material that was copyrighted by others, then you should <A HREF="/legalhelp/business/lawyers.html">consult a lawyer</A>.</P>

<H2>Trademarks</H2>

<P><I>This page is adapted from <A HREF="/store/lawguide.html">The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave  Legal Survival Guide</A>, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life, written by the editors of </I>The American Lawyer<I> and Court TV and published by Little, Brown & Co.</I></P>

<H4>What Is A Trademark?</H4>

<P>A trademark is a word, name or symbol that is used to identify products sold or services provided by a business. A trademark distinguishes the products or services of one business from those of others in the same field.</P>

<P>A trademark lets consumers know precisely what they are buying. For example, when consumers purchase cotton swabs bearing the trademark Q-tips Cotton Swabs, they know -- or are entitled to assume -- that those swabs came from one source: Chesebrough-Pond's USA Co. They also know -- or are entitled to assume -- that the Q-tips swabs are not swabs from some other source.</P>

<P>A business using a trademark has a trademark right, which means that the business can prevent other businesses from using the trademark and can get money to compensate for the infringement of the trademark right. Trademark protection is intended to protect consumers from confusion about what they are buying and help manufacturers guard the value of trademarks in which they have invested.</P>

<P>A trademark right can be acquired simply by using a trademark to identify your products or services. However, you should pick a trademark with care and make sure you are not choosing one that belongs to another business. Otherwise you could spend several months and much money promoting a new product line only to find that your advertising dollars are lost and that you have ended up assisting your competitor. You could also face a lawsuit if you fail to stop using someone else's trademark. Before deciding on a new trademark, you should have a lawyer conduct a search to locate any similar trademarks that may already be in use.</P>

<P>If someone is using your trademark, you should call the infringer and ask him or her to stop. If that fails -- as it often does -- you can threaten court action. If that fails -- as it often does -- you can commence an action and seek an order prohibiting further use of the trademark by the infringer. Courts often issue these orders. This process can be expensive. But it can be vital to the prosperity and future of a business. Imagine how Ford would fare if GM, Chrysler, Toyota and BMW were all free to call their automobiles Fords.</P>

<P>To preserve the rights to a trademark, its owner must use it and must police how others use it. Many words that have become part of our everyday vocabulary were once registered trademarks whose use became so widespread, their owners could no longer rightfully claim them.</P>

<P>Some of the most well-known lost trademarks, as they are called, include:

<UL>
  <LI> aspirin

  <LI> cellophane

  <LI> escalator

  <LI> thermos

  <LI> nylon
</UL>

<H4>How Do You Register A Trademark?</H4>

<P>Though you obtain the right to a trademark simply by using it, your right will be strongest if you register the trademark. You can register by filing an application with one or more state agencies, with the <A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a>, or with both. Federal registration is preferable, because the benefits of state registration are available only in the state of registration. The benefits of federal registration are available nationwide. Federal registration lasts initially for 10 years if the registration requirements are met and the trademark is used in connection with the product for which it is registered. The registration is renewable for consecutive 10-year periods. State registration and renewal periods vary from state to state.</P>

<P>A registration application typically asks for:

<UL>
  <LI> a description of the trademark

  <LI> an explanation of how you are using it or plan to use it in the future

  <LI> a statement that you believe no one else has a right to use it. 
</UL>

<P>If you are applying for federal registration, you also will have to show that you are involved in interstate commerce. You can apply for registration if you have actually used the mark or if you have an intention of using it.   </P>

<P>There are restrictions on federal registration of a person's last name or a geographic location as a trademark. For example, if you want to register trademarks like "NEW YORK" Cream Soda or "MR. SMITH'S" Cough Remedy, you will have to show that these common names have come to be associated with your products. You probably will have to prove that you have a consumer base that identifies "NEW YORK" with your cream soda and "MR. SMITH" with your cough syrup.  </P>

<P>The federal registration process can take a year or more. The filing fee, at present, is $245. You can prepare and file the necessary papers on your own, but it is advisable to <a href="/legalhelp/business/lawyers.html">consult a trademark lawyer</a> for at least some initial guidance. The legal fees involved in registering a trademark are typically less than those involved in obtaining a patent. </P>

<P>To signify your claim to a particular trademark, you can use the TM symbol if the trademark is unregistered. If it is registered, you can use the R inside a circle symbol.</P>

<H2>Patents</H2>

<P><I>This page is adapted from <A HREF="/store/lawguide.html">The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave  Legal Survival Guide</A>, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life, written by the editors of </I>The American Lawyer<I> and Court TV and published by Little, Brown & Co.</I></P>

<H4>What Is A Patent?</H4>

A patent is a document that is issued to an inventor by the <A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> in Washington, D.C. It contains a detailed description of what the invention is and how to make or use it. In addition, each patent has at least one "claim," which summarizes what the inventor asserts to be his or her protectible invention. Patents can have lots of claims ranging from the general to the specific if the invention warrants them.

If someone other than the inventor starts making, using or selling what is described in any claim of a patent, the patent is infringed. An inventor has the right to stop such an infringement and may be able to obtain money to compensate for any damage or injury caused by the infringement. This is called the patent right, and it runs for 20 years. (Note: The 20-year right applies to applications filed on or after June 8, 1995. Prior to that date patents were granted for 17 years.)

The basic idea behind patents is to encourage inventors to make their creations known to others so that everyone working in a particular field can develop further inventions based on the most up-to-date technology -- or get a license to use the creations. The theory is that this disclosure betters society as a whole. The 20-year patent right is granted as a fair exchange for full disclosure of the invention by the inventor.

<H4>What Makes An Invention Patentable?</H4>

<P>In deciding whether or not to grant a patent, the Patent Office considers a number of issues. These same issues may be reconsidered in court if a patent is later challenged in litigation. In general, to qualify for a patent:

<UL>
<LI> The invention must be new. If it was invented before and was not concealed by the previous inventor, it usually cannot be patented now, even if the prior inventor did not patent it.<P>

<LI> The invention must not be on sale or in public use more than a year before the application is filed. This is true even if the inventor has put it on sale or in public use. The moral here is to get the application on file as quickly as possible.<P>

<LI> The invention must not be obvious. Even if the exact invention was not made before, a creation cannot be patented if others have made similar inventions that render the new one obvious to other people in the same field.<P>

<LI> The invention must be fully disclosed in the application. If an inventor knows of some particularly good way to produce the creation, but keeps it secret, the patent may be invalid. If he creator tries to fool the Patent Office and a court later finds out about it, the creator will probably lose the patent.<P>

<LI> The prior inventions of others that an inventor knows about must be disclosed to the Patent Office -- if not in the application, then in a separate paper. If an inventor hides prior inventions from the Patent Office, and a court later finds out about it, the patent will probably be lost.<P>

<LI> The invention must be more than a mere idea. It must relate to a process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, such as a unique recipe.
</UL>

Note: Special patents are also available for ornamental designs that are new and original. For instance, if someone designed a distinctive bottle in the shape of a chili pepper to hold salsa, he could apply for a design patent. These are granted for only 14 years, rather than 20, and the procedures for applying are pretty much the same as for other patents, although an design patent application is usually shorter and simpler to prepare, since it is largely made up of drawings of the design.

<H4>What If Someone Else Comes Up With A Slightly Different Creation?</H4>

A rival invention that improves on your idea does not diminish your patent right, and you may be able to stop your competitor and collect money damages. You cannot, however, sell your invention with your rival's patented improvements. That is your rival's property, not yours. You are entitled only to continue selling your invention in its original form.

You also are free, of course, to dream up and patent your own improvements. Or you and your rival could reach an agreement in which one (or both) of you create the improved product, and the other is justly compensated.

<H4>What Should A Person Do If Someone Is Infringing On A Patent?</H4>

You most likely will need to <a href="/legalhelp/business/lawyer/688.html">consult a lawyer</a> since it is rarely so simple a problem to solve by calling up the infringer and declaring: "I have a patent that covers what you are doing. Please stop and pay me for the harm you've caused." In most cases, you will have to go to court, or at least threaten to do so. And if a court case is filed, you can usually expect a long, hard -- and expensive -- battle. The alleged infringer might claim not to be infringing or that your patent is not good.

The more valuable your invention, the more likely it is that people will try to copy it and then fight you in court. Patent lawyers often take cases on a contingency basis, which means you don't have to pay up front. Still, if you don't have significant financial resources, you may want to recruit a partner (or partners) in advance to help you defend the patent in exchange for a share of profits. The company that is going to manufacture your invention may be interested in such a deal.

<H4>Is A Patent Always The Best Way To Protect An Invention?</H4>

Not necessarily. Some inventions, like recipes, may be better off kept as trade secrets. That's what the Coca Cola Company has done for years with its soft drink formula, which remains a cherished trade secret that has never been patented.

The choice of whether or not to patent an invention or keep it as a trade secret is often dictated by commercial issues. So long as your potential competitors can't study your creation and figure out how to make -- and possibly patent -- it themselves, you may be fine keeping it as a trade secret.

Trade secrets do have legal protection against disclosure. For example, if a manufacturer is using a secret process, he or she can require that any employees keep the process secret -- even after they leave the company. And if an employee leaves to work elsewhere, the manufacturer can ask that the new employer not encourage disclosure of the secret process. It's also possible to file suit in court to prevent disclosure.

<H4>How Does A Person Get A Patent?</H4>

The first step is to prepare an application, which is then filed with the Patent Office. Your application should give a very detailed description about how best to make and use the invention. Sometimes, if a patent application is well-written and describes a functional and reproducible invention, the application itself may be sufficient. If it is unclear from your description that the invention will actually do what you say it will do, you may be asked to prove that your idea is workable by developing a prototype.

The application will be examined by government patent examiners whose job is to decide whether the application describes and claims something that is patentable. If an examiner decides that it does, a patent will be issued. If the examiner decides that it does not, your application will be rejected. You may try to change the examiner's mind, or you can try to modify your application so that the examiner finds it acceptable.

This process can take considerable time -- well over a year. If an examiner cannot be persuaded to issue a patent, you can either give up or appeal the rejection to a special board in the Patent Office. This takes more time.

<H4>Is A Lawyer Necessary?</H4>

No, but if you can afford one it's advisable. However, it's not cheap. The going rate for a simple application that sails through the Patent Office is several thousand dollars (depending on where you live). More complicated applications may cost even more. And there are also filing fees in the Patent Office ($155 minimum, at present). The cost of an attorney may be worth it, though. Patent Office procedures can be obscure and complex, and a seasoned patent attorney will know how to usher your application through as quickly as possible. If you seriously think you've reinvented the wheel (and if you think your idea is likely to be infringed on and thus the subject of court actions), it is usually best to <a href="/legalhelp/business/lawyers.html">hire an attorney</a>.

Mountains of paper have been written on the requirements for patentability -- by judges, lawyers, professors and others. If you plan to try getting a patent on your own, you should have at least a passing familiarity with these requirements.

<H2>Trade Names</H2>

<P><I>This page is adapted from <A HREF="/store/lawguide.html">The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave  Legal Survival Guide</A>, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life, written by the editors of </I>The American Lawyer<I> and Court TV and published by Little, Brown & Co.</I></P>

<H4>Can A Person Choose Any Name For A Company?</H4>

<P>No. While most states have only minimum requirements regarding the choice of a company name, known in legal lingo as a trade name, you will have trouble if you pick the exact name or one that too closely resembles that of a competitor. In general, state laws:

<UL>
<LI> require that a company that is incorporated include a designation such as "Inc." or "Company" in the name.<P>

<LI> prohibit the use in the name of such words as "insurance" or "mortgage," for example unless the corporation is going to engage in that particular business.<P>

<LI> prohibit the use of a name under which a business is already incorporated in that state.
</UL>

<P>If you are incorporating, you should first check with the secretary of state of the state in which you plan to incorporate to determine whether the name you have chosen is available for your use. In many states this can be done by telephone, at a nominal cost.</P>

<P>If the name that you have chosen appears to be available, you may incorporate under it. It is important that you understand, however, that your right to incorporate under that name does not automatically give you exclusive rights to the name itself. There may be, for example, an already-existing unincorporated enterprise doing business under the identical or similar name, and that business might have rights that are superior to yours. In fact, the use of a name could, under such circumstances, put you at risk of a lawsuit by that enterprise for "infringing" ("trespassing") on its rights to the name. </P>

<P>The outcome of such a lawsuit would depend on a number of factors including, in particular, whether you were both engaged in similar lines of business and served roughly the same geographic markets. If so, the other corporation might be able to prevent you from using the name and, possibly, even recover damages from you. This would be a particularly undesirable outcome if you had invested substantial time and money developing marketing materials, for example, in which you used the name.</P>

<P>Before choosing a corporate name, then, you should check not only its availability with the appropriate secretary of state's office, but also its use within the general area in which you intend to do business. You can begin with telephone directories and trade directories, which should be available at your public library or local chamber of commerce. You should also check for "d/b/a certificates" that may have been filed with the secretary of state or the county clerk's office.</P>

<P>If your preliminary searches do not turn up a similarly-named business, or if they do, and your respective businesses are in unrelated fields or non-overlapping markets, the chances that you will be able to incorporate and do business under that name, undisturbed, are improved.</P>

<P>Quite often, though, circumstances are not particularly clear-cut. You should <a href="/legalhelp/business/lawyers.html">consult an attorney</a>, particularly if you intend to produce expensive marketing materials before you incorporate.</P>

<h2>Divorce: A Basic Introduction</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>How does a couple go about getting divorced?</B><BR>
Traditionally, since divorce was not as socially acceptable as it is today, the only way you could get a divorce was by proving that your spouse had done something so horrible, such as commit adultery or physically abuse you, that you should no longer be required to live with him or her. Even if your breakup was mutual and amicable, one spouse had to accuse the other of failing to live up to the marriage contract--and then prove it.</P>

<P>Divorce is easier today, but that doesn't mean you can just walk into a courtroom and say "I want to end my marriage." Even if you and your spouse are in total agreement about how you will divide your assets, you must still show the judge, who has the final power to grant the divorce, that both parties are being treated fairly in the division of property and settlement of custody and support. As importantly, you must also show the judge that there is a reason why the divorce should be granted. These reasons are commonly referred to as grounds for divorce, and there are two kinds: fault and no-fault.</P>

<P>In most states, a divorce will be granted if you can show that your spouse was at fault for the failure of your marriage. The most common fault grounds for granting a divorce are:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>adultery
<LI>physical or mental abuse
<LI>imprisonment for a crime
<LI>drug or alcohol abuse
<LI>willful and deliberate desertion
<LI>incest
<LI>mental incapacity or insanity
<LI>fraud
<LI>impotence
</UL>

<P>Today, most states also have laws that provide for no-fault divorce. The concept of a no-fault divorce is that it doesn't matter who did what to whom that caused the marriage to break down; all that matters is that there is no reasonable prospect of reconciliation. You still have to show the court that you are no longer able to live together as a couple. The most common grounds for a no-fault divorce are:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>separation
<LI>irreconcilable differences
<LI>irretrievable breakdown

<P>So if you file for divorce on no-fault grounds you are in essence saying that you should no longer be married because: 1) you no longer live together or 2) you are no longer compatible and have very different goals, needs and desires out of life or 3) your marriage has deteriorated beyond the point of repair.</P>

<P>Again, the essence of these no-fault grounds is that it doesn't matter what caused the breakdown of the marriage. It recognizes that in many cases, neither individual is solely to blame. However, a no-fault divorce is not necessarily quick and easy, since you still have to agree on the issues of child support, custody and division of property.</P>

<P><B>Which is the better way to proceed--fault or no-fault?</B><BR>
It really depends on several factors, including the laws of your state and the circumstances of your breakup. All states allow you to include both fault and no-fault grounds in your petition for a divorce. Sometimes you will be able to speed up the process by including fault grounds, like an accusation of abandonment. And in some states, you may also be entitled to more alimony or child support if you can prove your spouse is at fault. Other states, however, don't consider fault an issue, so there may be nothing to gain. An attorney can advise you on the best strategy based on the laws of your state.</P>

<P>Also, if you file for a no-fault divorce, it does not necessarily mean that your spouse agrees with you about ending the marriage. The distinction between a divorce on no-fault grounds and a divorce on fault grounds lies in the nature of the proofs required to get the divorce and not in whether both parties have agreed that a divorce is the best course.</P>

<P><B>What happens if one spouse does not consent to a divorce?</B><BR>
If your spouse doesn't want a divorce it's still going to move forward. However, your spouse may contest your claims and force you to prove they are true. What's key is that as long as you can prove a grounds for divorce (that your spouse committed adultery, for instance), your spouse cannot force your to remain married. If you can't prove it's true, then your divorce won't be granted unless you have some additional grounds that you can prove. That is one reason why it may be good to file for divorce on more than one grounds.</P>

<P><B>What is the procedure for getting a divorce?</B><BR>
Even if you and your spouse agree on all the terms of your breakup, divorce is still an adversarial process, in which one party must sue the other. You can't just both say we agree and get divorced, since our laws reflect society's belief that it shouldn't be easy to end a marriage. Of course, the specifics vary from state to state, but in general:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>You establish that you have grounds for a divorce
<LI>One spouse files a petition or complaint. It asks for a divorce and explains all the reasons why one should be granted. You may list both fault and no-fault grounds at the same time.
<LI>A summons will be served, notifying the other spouse that the petition has been filed. If the spouse cannot be located, each state has different rules about how to proceed. Some, for instance, require that a notice be published in the newspaper.
<LI>The other spouse must respond within a certain time limit. Otherwise it is assumed that the spouse does not contest the petition.
<LI>The other spouse may countersue if he or she has grounds for divorce. (One reason this might be done is so that both parties "win." It's more psychological than anything else.)
<LI>Both sides may engage in discovery, in which the lawyers will request relevant information and documents.
<LI>An attempt is made to reach a settlement
<LI>If a settlement is reached, then the settlement agreement is submitted to the court, and a hearing is held. The judge will ask a number of questions to determine that both parties entered into the agreement freely and understand what they are doing. The judge basically cares that you've entered into the agreement freely, not whether you should or shouldn't get the house. If the judge approves the settlement agreement, he or she will issue a divorce decree. (A judge can refuse to grant a divorce if he or she finds that there are no grounds to do so, or if neither of the parties are residents of the state.)
<LI>If no settlement can be reached, then there will be a trial. The judge will decide the outcome and issue a divorce decree. (Juries rarely hear divorce cases.)
</UL>

<P><B>How long does the whole process take?</B><BR>
It can be as little as several months or as much as several years. The amount of time depends in great part upon how much you and your spouse can agree upon; the more you are able to determine between you, the less will be in dispute for a judge to decide. If you both are employed and have minimal income other than what is shown on your W-2 forms every year, financial issues will be fairly easy to work out. On the other hand, if one or both of you owns a small business or is working in a family business, sorting out the financial issues can be incredibly complex and may take years to investigate properly.
The length that a divorce takes also depends in great measure upon the judicial system in your state, and maybe even the one in your county. (see also Quickie Divorces, page TK) Some court systems move more efficiently than others, and each case is unique. So there really is no way to tell how long it will take to get divorced. Even apparently simple cases can blow up suddenly into complex ones.</P>

<P><B>Is there always a trial?</B><BR>
Only if you and your spouse cannot reach a settlement. If you do go to trial, the decisions on custody, support and dividing property will be left to the judge, so it's often best if you and your spouse can negotiate a settlement agreement outside of court. This agreement spells out the terms of your divorce.</P>

<P>If your case does proceed to a trial, it will probably be heard by a judge. Juries rarely hear divorce cases.</P>

<P><B>Are divorce records public?</B><BR>
Yes. Anything that is filed with the court is part of the public record, and any interested individual can go to the court clerk's office and request to see a divorce file. Similarly, anyone who is interested can come and sit in the courtroom while a divorce case is being presented.</P>

<P>However, due to the sometimes sensitive nature of allegations in divorce cases, it may be possible under your state's laws to have your file sealed and the courtroom closed during proceedings. Such a request might be granted, for example, if there are allegations of sexual abuse of children. In other situations where the file contains information, such as intimate financial details that could be damaging to the business of one of the spouses, it may be possible to obtain a protective order. That order would prevent the disclosure of the sensitive information (except to certain individuals under certain conditions). Whether or not your case can be sealed will depend upon the particular case and the law in your state.</P>

<P><B>What is divorce mediation?</B><BR>
An increasing number of people are using mediation as an alternative to the traditional route of litigation. In mediation, there is one person who works with both spouses. The mediator knows the law and is often a practicing attorney or a retired judge. The mediator will listen to both sides, make suggestions, and attempt to lead the two of you to a consensus, instead of imposing a decision upon you as a judge would.</P>

<P>An advantage of mediation is that consensual agreements are more likely to be complied with in the future, and they usually leave the parties feeling more satisfied with the outcomes. It is also usually much cheaper to mediate than to litigate.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, because you still must go through the court system to get divorced, you may not be able to avoid lawyers altogether. The mediator can help you work out the settlement agreement, but he or she can't file it for you in court. (That's because it would be an ethical conflict for the mediator to represent both of you in a court proceeding.)</P>

<P>Even if your mediator is a lawyer, you should each have a separate attorney review your agreement.</P>

<P>Of course, mediation does not always result in an agreement and, therefore, litigation may become necessary. Also, mediation may not suit every situation. If you and your spouse have difficulty communicating, or harbor strong feelings of anger and hostility towards each other, or if there are allegations of abuse, or if one of you is extremely resistant to the idea of a divorce, mediation may be doomed from the start. On the other hand, if you have a relatively simple case and you and your spouse already agree on many issues, mediation may be beneficial.</P>

<P><B>Is it possible to get a "quickie" divorce?</B><BR>
A so-called "quickie divorce" may not in fact be valid, and you should be very careful about getting one. All states require that you reside there for some period of time before a divorce petition can be filed, with the time periods ranging six weeks up to one year. The only benefit to this type of divorce is that it may free you quickly to remarry. However, if you want to get alimony, child support or contest any issues of property settlement, this is not the route to go.</P>

<P>If you do want to obtain a quick divorce, you (or your spouse) would have to move to the other state and establish a bona fide residence there for the minimum time required. States impose these time limits to assure that marriage as an institution is not trivialized and that people do not act rashly and without thinking their decisions through.</P>

<P><B>Can a person go to a foreign country for a quick divorce?</B><BR>
There are countries that do not have stringent requirements in order to get a divorce. One of the most well-known is Mexico. However, many states will refuse to recognize a foreign divorce if the parties legally resided in the state and only went to the foreign country for the purpose of obtaining the divorce. Again, you would have to check your state's law to determine whether or not a foreign, quick divorce would be valid in your state. If your divorce is not considered valid in your state, you could someday run into a problem with bigamy if you remarry.</P>

<P><B>How long after a divorce must a person wait before getting remarried?</B><BR>
In most states, you can get married the day your divorce decree is made final if you want. In the few states that do set a time limit, the period is not very long, except in Oklahoma and Wisconsin where the parties must wait six months after a divorce is final to remarry. You would have to check the laws in your state to determine whether or not there is any restriction on your remarriage.</P>

<h2>Alimony</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>When is a spouse entitled to alimony?</B><BR>
When a couple marries, they essentially are pledging to support each other for the duration of their lives. This financial obligation does not end if they divorce. Alimony, also known as maintenance or spousal support, is the money paid by one spouse to the other in order to fulfill that obligation. In the traditional marriage, a husband had to pay alimony to his wife upon their divorce, because he had the career and she was the full-time homemaker.</P>

<P>These notions and biases, however, have become outdated and are being eliminated from the law. Today, in most states either a husband or a wife may be awarded alimony. It is also no longer a given that a spouse will receive alimony for the rest of his or her life after a divorce. Instead, temporary or "rehabilitative" alimony, which gives a spouse alimony for a limited period of time so that he or she may establish a career and become self-supporting, is becoming far more common.</P>

<P>Say, for example, that you and your spouse were married after high school. You both worked for a few years, then you stayed home to raise your children. You are now both 28, you have two children, ages 2 and 5, and you have been out of the work force for five-and-a-half years. During that time, your spouse has been advancing rapidly in his or her chosen field and is doing fairly well. Since you are still young, and since your marriage was of fairly short duration, you are unlikely to be awarded lifetime alimony. But since you have sacrificed your own career in order to devote yourself to your spouse and your family, you should not be penalized for that decision.</P>

<P>In this case a judge may order rehabilitative alimony for the period of time it takes you to reestablish yourself in your field. This could be as little as one year or as long as ten years, depending upon what further education you need, what kind of salaries you could hope for in the first few years, the job market, and your responsibilities to any minor children. If you are unable to find a job, you could apply to the court for a modification that will extend the alimony period. However, you will need to have a good reason why you were unable to find a job.</P>

<P>Rehabilitative alimony is a flexible concept, which has been very helpful to people who are not entitled to lifelong alimony but who need assistance in the short term.</P>

<P>The obligation to pay alimony usually ends if the supported spouse remarries, since he or she presumably will no longer need to be supported. The obligation may also end if the supported spouse lives together with someone in a relationship tantamount to marriage.</P>

<P>The factors on which alimony are based depend on state law. Generally, they include:
<UL>
<LI>the age and health of the parties
<LI>the length of the marriage
<LI>the ability of both spouses to be self-supporting
<LI>responsibilities to minor children
<LI>the income of the breadwinner
<LI>the lifestyle the parties enjoyed during the marriage
</UL>

<P>Alimony is intended to support the spouse at the level to which he or she became accustomed during the marriage, so if you have no means to support yourself, or if your income is inadequate to maintain you at the level to which you were accustomed during the marriage, you will generally be entitled to some amount of support, although it may be for only a limited duration.</P>

<P><B>Can alimony include payments for medical and life insurance?</B><BR>
Yes. Medical and life insurance are both usually taken into account these days in divorce settlements. If you did not work during the marriage and you relied upon your spouse to provide medical insurance for you, he or she may be required to maintain you on the policy while the case is proceeding and may have to buy an alternate policy for you after the divorce. Alternatively, if you receive alimony on a monthly basis, the amount you receive may include a sum for health insurance costs, but you would then be responsible for maintaining your own policy.</P>

<P>If you are receiving permanent alimony (as opposed to temporary alimony), it is likely that your former spouse may be required to maintain life insurance as a protection against his or her untimely death. However, if you want to maintain insurance on your own life, your former spouse probably will not be required to pay for that life insurance (since your former spouse is probably not going to be the beneficiary).</P>

<P>If you participate in the health insurance plan offered by your spouse's employer, you are entitled by federal law to remain in the plan for 36 months after your divorce. Either you or your ex-spouse will have to pay for the coverage.</P>

<P><B>What happens to pension plan money in a divorce?</B><BR>
The theory is that, while you were married, part of your spouse's compensation was in the form of deferred benefits, which you expected to share in at retirement. In general, you will only be entitled to that portion of the pension or retirement fund that had accumulated during the marriage. And then you will only get your share, not the whole thing.</P>

<P>You should be aware that money that is to be received in the future has a lower value in the present. So, if a woman has $100 in the bank today, that $100 will be worth more in ten years because it will earn interest. At the same time, if her husband says he is going to give her $100 in ten years, the value of that money today will be less since it has not yet earned the interest.</P>

<P>To determine the reasonable value of pension and other retirement benefits, most people hire a professional known as an actuary. Then, if your spouse can afford to buy you out at that present value, you can get your money up-front. If that is not possible, you will have to wait to receive this money until your spouse retires.</P>

<P><B>Does a person have the right to a share of the spouse's social security benefits?</B><BR>
Probably. If the couple had been married for at least ten years, a spouse would be entitled to a portion of the Social Security benefits the other spouse receives after retiring. Also, if you receive child support from your spouse, the children will usually be able to receive Social Security payments if your ex-spouse becomes disabled and collects Social Security benefits.</P>

<P><B>How do you collect pension fund benefits?</B><BR>
You can file what is known as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO or DRO). This is a court order that directs the pension plan administrator as to how to distribute the fund when your spouse does, in fact, retire. The order is usually granted after a couple is divorced. It's advisable to consult a lawyer to help you because the process is very complicated. You may also need to hire an accountant.</P>

<P>Once you get the QDRO, what generally will happen is that you will receive a check from the pension fund at the same time that your former spouse does, and the amount that your former spouse receives will be less than it would have been without the QDRO. Depending on the plan, you may be able to elect how and when you will receive your benefits, regardless of what your former spouse does. If the plan can set aside the amount you are entitled to, you would receive a monthly check directly from the plan.</P>

<P>Remember, though, every plan is different!</P>

<P>You would continue to receive that money until you hit the maximum amount to which you are entitled, after which all payments to you would cease. If your spouse's plan cannot set aside a lump sum for you, you would simply receive a fixed percentage of his or her monthly pension benefit for as long as he or she received it. If he or she never collected, neither would you.</P>

<P><B>What can a spouse do if he or she thinks the other is lying about finances?</B><BR>
Perhaps one of the most difficult financial aspects of divorce is making sure that everything is "on the table" when you sit down to negotiate a settlement or to present your case to the court. It is difficult, time consuming work to trace the movement of money, stocks, and similar papers, and it is nearly impossible to trace items of personal property, such as jewelry, Krugerrands, clothing, and other similar items. Even cars and boats that are registered with the state can be disposed of fairly easily if your spouse knows the right people.</P>

<P>It is very difficult to prove that assets have been hidden, especially if you have only a suspicion that it has been done. For example, if you knew for a fact that your spouse had a bank account in a certain bank which was only in his or her name, you could get a court order to see the records of that bank and find out information about the account. But if all you have is a suspicion that your spouse was stashing money somewhere, it's generally not cost effective to search every single bank in the United states hoping that you'll find something. The services of a private detective or investigator may be useful in finding misappropriated assets, but again, there is no guarantee. If your spouse is clever, and if he or she contemplated the divorce long before you knew about it, the money may be long gone and even out of the country.</P>

<P>If you suspect your spouse is hiding assets, you can search for them through a legal process known as discovery (in which you are trying to "discover" relevant information). Through discovery your attorney can ask your spouse to turn over applicable financial records, such as:
<UL>
<LI>tax returns
<LI>bank account statements
<LI>brokerage house statements
<LI>real estate records
<LI>loan applications
</UL>

<P>Your spouse and others, such as employers, business associates, or bank officials, can also be questioned under oath in a deposition.</P>

<P>An analysis of the records together with the information from the depositions should help put together an accurate picture of your spouse's finances.</P>

<P>If you find out after your divorce that your spouse had some assets that were concealed from you and from the court, you can ask the court to modify the order or rescind the entire agreement since it was based on fraud. However, most states have time limits during which the agreement can be "attacked." If you discover the fraud after the time limit has passed, you may, unfortunately be stuck with the agreement.</P>

<P><B>Can alimony be paid in one lump sum instead of spread out over time?</B><BR>
Yes. Alimony is usually paid on a regular schedule out of the income of the paying spouse. However, if both parties desire, and the paying spouse has the financial ability, they can certainly arrange to have alimony paid in one lump sum. Remember, almost anything is possible if you and your spouse agree to it. One advantage of getting a lump sum would be psychological; both of you would be able to get on with your lives as individuals without ties to your past. Another advantage would be the fact that you would have all of your money to spend or invest as you wish and you would not have to rely upon someone sending you a check every week or every two weeks or every month.</P>

<P><B>What are the disadvantages of a lump sum payment?</B><BR>
The main disadvantage is that you would not have a guaranteed, steady income in the future. So if you are not good at budgeting yourself and investing so that you got steady income from the lump sum, you could find yourself within a short time in very dire financial circumstances.</P>

<P>You might arrange for the lump sum to be paid in several installments over the course of a few years. If so, you might lose some of the future installments if you remarry. Also, you may face a high tax bill if you get all the money at once, since the recipient must pay taxes on alimony. An accountant or tax advisor can advise you whether a lump sum would result in a heavy tax burden. (Taxwise, a lump sum payment might be good for the spouse who pays it, because the alimony payments are tax-deductible.)</P>

<P><B>How does a person collect delinquent alimony?</B><BR>
Unfortunately, this problem arises very frequently. It has always been a difficult task to collect alimony from an unwilling former spouse, but state and federal laws are making it a bit easier to do so now. The remedies for collecting unpaid alimony are similar to those for collecting unpaid child support.</P>

<P><B>Under what circumstances can alimony be increased?</B><BR>
If your judgment of divorce provides for payments of alimony over a long period of time without taking into account inflation and other increases in the cost of living, there will undoubtedly come a time when the alimony payment you receive is simply inadequate to meet your needs.</P>

<P>Other changes that would justify an increase in alimony include:
<UL>
<LI>an injury that renders you incapable of ever working again (if you were working to contribute to your own support)
<LI>a long-term illness
<LI>termination from your job
<LI>illness of a child that requires your full-time, long-term care
</UL>

<P>Any of these (and others) are possible foundations for a request to increase alimony payments. You should consult an attorney who can tell you specifically under the laws of your state whether or not an increase is warranted.</P>

<P><B>How do you get an increase in your support payments?</B><BR>
If your payments are being made through the probation department then there is probably a form you can fill out to request an increase. You will most likely be required to show exactly why you need an increase. If, for instance, your settlement did not include a cost-of-living increase, or if you can prove your former spouse is making more money you may be able to get an increase.</P>

<P>If your payments are not being made through the probation department, you will have to start a lawsuit by filing a motion to increase the payments. There may be forms available, but it would probably be helpful to consult an attorney.</P>

<P><B>When can alimony be decreased?</B><BR>
When circumstances change such that it is no longer fair or reasonable for you to pay the same amount. One of the most frequent changes is retirement. If your final judgment of divorce does not take into account this event, you may need to make a motion to the court to modify your alimony obligation. Many courts distinguish between voluntary early retirement and mandatory retirement. If a person retires at age 55, the court might deem that to be a voluntary retirement that does not justify a change in alimony.</P>

<P>Some of the other changed circumstances that may justify a downward modification of alimony include:
<UL>
<LI>an illness or disability that prevents you from working
<LI>the loss of your job and an inability to find a similar position at a similar salary despite a diligent search
<LI>a downward turn in the economy which results in bad times for your privately held business, partnership or a corporation
</UL>

<P>You will need to consult an attorney as to the specifics of the law in your state. Regardless of whether you are seeking an increase or a decrease, you will need to show a significant change in circumstances affecting your ability to pay.</P>

<P><B>Does a person who remarries lose his or her alimony?</B><BR>
Very possibly. The original concept of alimony assumed that a spouse (generally female) was simply incapable of taking care of herself and needed to be looked after (first by her father, then by her husband). Therefore, it made sense that alimony would end when she remarried because now she had another caretaker who was able to support her.</P>

<P>The general principle remains that once a recipient of alimony remarries, the need for alimony disappears. If you could talk your spouse into it, you might be able to reach a settlement that provided for alimony to continue past your remarriage. It is doubtful, however, that anyone would agree to such an arrangement, and judges can't generally impose such a requirement.</P>

<P>The only possible exception to this "marry and lose it" concept arises if you are receiving rehabilitative alimony. Since the concept of rehabilitative alimony is to get you reestablished in a career, it is not so heavily tied to the idea that you need someone supporting you because you can't take care of yourself. Thus, it's possible that your divorce settlement could state that your rehabilitative alimony would continue (probably at a reduced rate) if you remarry.</P>

<P><B>If an ex-spouse is living with someone is that grounds to stop paying alimony?</B><BR>
Maybe. If your spouse is living with someone in a relationship that is akin to a marriage, where they both contribute to expenses, or where his or her companion is providing full financial support, you should have a good argument for termination of alimony. It helps if your divorce decree listed cohabitation as a reason to terminate the alimony. If it doesn't, you will have to check the law in your state to see under what circumstances a living together relationship can be used to terminate alimony. If your ex-spouse is simply sharing quarters with a person in order to save money, he or she can't be punished for that. The nature of the relationship and its similarity to marriage is what counts when deciding whether alimony should be terminated.</P>

<P><B>Can a person just stop paying?</B><BR>
It's not advisable to do so. You may find yourself sued for non-payment and you would have to defend your actions. If you are arrested for non-payment of support, your arguments about why you don't have to pay won't mean much to the police.</P>

<h2>Annulment</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>When can a marriage be annulled?</B><BR>
An annulment is a legal decree, like a divorce, but it states that the marriage was never valid. It has the legal effect of wiping out a marriage as though it never existed. It is not the same as religious annulment, which will have its own requirements, and a religious annulment will have no bearing on the legal status of your marriage.</P>

<P>There are two different types of marriages that can be annulled: void and voidable. A void marriage is one that is void and invalid from its beginning. It is as though the marriage never existed and it requires no formality to terminate it. Some of the reasons why a marriage would be considered void from its inception include:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>incest
<LI>bigamy
<LI>fraud or duress
<LI>one party was incapable of consenting because of his or her mental state
<LI>impotence at the time of the marriage
</UL>

<P>A voidable marriage, by contrast, is a valid marriage with an inherent flaw. Say, for instance, one of the parties was not yet of legal age to marry. If they never challenge the marriage, it remains a valid marriage. If, however, one or both of them decides to challenge the marriage, and the challenge is found to be valid, then it will be as though the marriage had never taken place. (However, despite the annulment, children will not be made illegitimate.) So, if two minors get married and have children and then twelve years later decide to split up, they can probably have their marriage annulled.</P>

<P><B>Can a spouse collect alimony when a marriage is annulled?</B><BR>
When a marriage is annulled, it is the same as if it never existed, and therefore, alimony traditionally was not available. Most states have changed that harsh rule. Also, your state will determine how property should be distributed after an annulment. Since the obligation to pay child support arises out of being a parent, not out of being married, the non-custodial parent will still owe child support.</P>

<P><B>How do you obtain an annulment?</B><BR>
Generally, an annulment is obtained in similar manner to a divorce, in a proceeding which is begun by filing a Complaint or Petition for Annulment. As with a divorce, the parties do not need to consent. It is important to remember the difference between a legal annulment and a religious annulment. You will have to check with your religious minister to determine whether a legal annulment obtained will dissolve your marriage for purposes of being able to remarry in accordance with the laws of your religion.</P>

<h2>Child Custody and Visitation</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <A HREF="/store/">online store</A>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>What are the basic forms of child custody?</B><BR>
There are two different kinds: legal custody and physical custody. A parent who has legal custody has the right to be involved in all the decision making typically involved with being a parent, such as:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>religious upbringing
<LI>schooling
<LI>health and medical decisions
<LI>moral development
</UL>

<P>The guiding principle in custody decisions is this question: What is in the best interest of the child? There is no single definition of what is meant by this very broad concept. It is tied to the facts of each specific situation and allows a judge to do what he or she thinks is best for a child based on the particular circumstances.</P>

<P>Custody can be either sole or joint. In the past, it was common for a mother to receive sole legal and physical custody, thereby pretty much shutting fathers out of the parenting process once a divorce occurred. However, the recent trend is towards joint legal custody, so that both parents have an equal involvement in the major life decisions affecting their child, regardless of who has physical custody. Sole legal custody is becoming less common, and most courts prefer to keep both parents actively involved in their children's lives unless there is a very good reason why they should not be. One such good reason would be abuse or neglect.</P>

<P>Since joint legal custody doesn't usually mean that the children live half the time with one parent and half with the other, it is necessary to work out a schedule of visitation that will be incorporated into the final divorce order. Everyone should work out a schedule that meets their own particular needs. Typically, the non-residental parent will have the children every other weekend (Friday to Sunday) throughout the year and will visit one night or two during the week. Major holidays and birthdays alternate.</P>

<P>The guiding principle in working out a schedule should be what is in the best interests of the child. If one parent often travels during the week, it may be more feasible for the children to live with that parent during the weekends. Also, when making a schedule it is important that both parents have quality time with the children. Thus, it would be unfair to a working mother with physical custody if the children spent every weekend with their father.</P>

<P>As joint legal custody becomes more prevalent, it is also becoming more common for a father to have joint physical custody of the children. In fact, there is an active and growing "father's movement" that is seeking to refute some of the assumptions on which custody decisions have typically been made, namely that children of a very young age are best off with their mother. Joint physical custody doesn't necessarily mean that the children live exactly one-half of the time with one parent and one-half with the other. It does mean that both parents spend a substantial amount of time with the children.</P>

<P>It is important that your divorce not become a battle over custody if that is not genuinely an issue; custody should not be used as a threat or a weapon. However, if you genuinely feel that sole legal custody is appropriate or that you are the more appropriate residential parent, you should certainly make your feelings known.</P>

<P><B>Is the preference of the children considered in custody decisions?</B><BR>
Very possibly. Generally, when judges have to make a custody decision, they will interview the children in private. The age of the child will determine how much weight the judge gives to his or her preferences. For example, a three-year-old really can't make a choice about custody because he or she is too young to understand the ramifications of that decision. In contrast, a teenager may have some very clear preferences and some very strong reasons to back them up. The older the child gets, the harder it is to compel him or her to obey a custody and visitation order, so an older child's wishes will carry more weight.</P>

<P>Judges will listen very closely to what the children have to say. If the judge determines that the child has been coached or bribed or convinced in some way to choose one parent over the other, the judge will generally disregard those statements and may penalize the parent who influenced the child.</P>

<P><B>Can one parent decide what religious upbringing the children will have?</B><BR>
Not if the parents have joint custody, and certainly not if their divorce settlement stated that the children were to be raised as Catholics. If it did, then raising them in any kind of religious institution against the wishes of the other spouse would be a violation of the settlement agreement. The other spouse could apply to the court for a restraining order. If no previous decision was made and they have joint decision-making power, a court would hear both positions and determine what is in the best interests of the children under the circumstances.</P>

<P>Spouses in this type of situation may need to seek counseling together in order to resolve this issue. The religious upbringing of children, just like their education, is typically a decision for both parents, if you have joint custody, and you should not hesitate to seek court intervention if your former spouse is disregarding your wishes on such an important issue.</P>

<P><B>Could one parent stop paying child support to protest how the children are being raised or because visitation is being denied?</B><BR>
No. Generally, child support is a court-ordered financial obligation. One parent's displeasure with an aspect of custody or even a denial of visitation does not allow for a unilateral termination of the child support obligation. The remedy is to go to court.</P>

<P><B>Can custody go to somebody other than the parents?</B><BR>
In very rare cases where it would be inappropriate to award physical custody to either of the biological parents, the child may be placed with someone else. Generally, however, the rights of biological and adoptive parents are superior to the claims of any other relative by blood or marriage. If the biological parents feel that a grandparent or step-parent would be a better custodian for their child, they can certainly agree to that arrangement.</P>

<P><B>Can a parent be denied custody because he or she is gay?</B><BR>
The rights of homosexual parents are only recently being recognized. For a long time, a gay parent could not obtain custody of his or her child, because it was felt that such a person's lifestyle was wrong or immoral. However, as with many other lifestyle choices, such as interracial marriage or single parenthood, the laws in most states have recognized that the simple fact that a parent is gay should have no bearing on whether he or she is unfit to raise a child. As with all custody decisions, the important question is what is best for the child and what bearing the parent's lifestyle--be it gay or heterosexual--will have on the child.</P>

<P><B>Under what circumstances can the custody be changed?</B><BR>
The reasons for a change in custody will vary from state to state. In general, however, if it becomes inappropriate for one reason or another for a parent to have physical or legal custody, the other parent can attempt to have custody changed. For instance, if the parent with custody becomes involved with drugs or other illegal activities, thus exposing the children to immoral and unlawful behavior and to physical danger, it would likely merit a change. (Of course, the court would require proof of this.) On the other hand, if the parent with physical custody chooses to live with someone without being married few courts are likely to interfere.</P>

<P>You should contact a lawyer to determine what the law is in your state regarding change of custody.</P>

<P><B>What happens if the parent who has custody dies?</B><BR>
Custody would generally revert to the other parent. If that parent would not be an appropriate caretaker a third party could intervene on behalf of the child.</P>

<P><B>Can a parent be denied visitation rights after a divorce?</B><BR>
Yes, but only under extremely limited circumstances. In general, it is presumed that it is in a child's best interests to have contact with both parents. It is only if the parent (or the parent's behavior) is a threat to the child in some manner that visitation will be denied. For example, if it is demonstrated that the parent abused the children in some way, a judge may determine that it is best not to permit the parent and children to be alone together. The person seeking to prevent visitation will have a very heavy burden to prove that circumstances justify a total denial of contact.</P>

<P>An alternative to no visitation is supervised visitation, where the parent sees the children in the presence of a third party who will be able to prevent any harmful action. The person who supervises can be a family member, close friend, counselor, or clergyman. Some communities have court-supervised visitation programs, in which a government worker or volunteer oversees the visit.</P>

<P><B>Can an ex-spouse who has custody move with the children to another state?</B><BR>
Not unless the court gives permission or the ex-spouse consents. The rules vary from state to state, and you should consult an attorney to find out what your local laws are. The obvious problem with moving out of state with the children is that it will usually interfere with your former spouse's visitation with the children. (A parent who does not have physical custody can move anywhere he or she wants.)</P>

<P>You will be asked about the reasons for your move. The questions might include:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>What impact will the move have on the children?
<LI>Will you find opportunities there that are unavailable here?
<LI>How far away are you moving?
<LI>What will the impact be on your former spouse's visitation rights?
<LI>Are you doing this just to thwart your spouse's visitation?
</UL>

<P>Everything depends upon the specific circumstances of your case, as well as the law in your state. It may be, for instance, that by moving out of state, you only add a few minutes or a half an hour onto the drive, and the visitation times can be adjusted to account for that time. Or, if you have enough money and an airport is convenient to both of you, your ex-spouse may agree to see the children for several longer visitations each year instead of every other weekend.</P>

<P>If you move without the consent of your former spouse or court permission, you may be arrested for kidnapping, so you really should consult an attorney if this problem arises for you.</P>

<P>Note: While you may be restricted from moving even one mile if it means you'll cross state lines, there are no limitations on your freedom to move within the same state--even if it's 200 miles away, unless your divorce agreement specifically restricts your ability to move.</P>

<P><B>Does a grandparent have the right to visit the children after a divorce?</B><BR>
In general, no one other than the child's biological or adoptive parents and, in some states, siblings, have an automatic right to visit. Grandparents and other relatives may see the child when the custodial parent permits it, or when the non-custodial parent has visitation. Many states provide for grandparent visitation if it is demonstrated that such visitation would be in a child's best interests.</P>

<P>As with all issues in a divorce, the parties involved may agree to whatever terms and provisions they want. Thus, if you and your spouse want to allow grandparents to visit, you can negotiate to include such a provision in your divorce settlement.</P>

<P><B>Do step-parents have a right to visit?</B><BR>
Not usually, unless it is demonstrated that visitations would be in the best interests of a child. This is especially true when a step-parent has assumed the role of parent. And again, you and your spouse could agree to include a visitation arrangement in your divorce settlement.</P>

<h2>Child Support</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>How is child support determined?</B><BR>
Each state has guidelines that help determine how much child support should be. The amount of child support will depend upon the incomes of both parents. Usually, child support can be increased when the paying parent achieves an increase in income through a raise or promotion. It can also be increased as the cost of living rises. Often a divorce decree includes a provision for an automatic cost of living increase each year. If it doesn't, the spouse receiving child support can ask the court for an increase.</P>

<P>In addition, federal laws require child support to be reviewed automatically every three years in a proceeding lead by an administrative officer, usually from the state's probation department. Questions have been raised about the legality of such a constant invasion of the privacy of individuals and the propriety of putting such reviews in the hands of administrative officials instead of the state courts. But so far no challenges have succeeded in overturning the law.</P>

<P><B>Can child support ever be reduced or increased?</B><BR>
Yes. Child support will generally be reduced if the paying parent suffers an economic loss or downturn that is relatively permanent in nature. For example, if the parent loses his or her job, child support may be reduced for the time in which the parent is not working. When the parent hits retirement, support can then be adjusted as well. Likewise, if the paying parent receives a substantial increase in income, it may be possible to modify the support.</P>

<P><B>Can an unmarried mother get support from the father of her child?</B><BR>
Yes. She will have to bring a lawsuit (assuming the father does not want to cooperate), which asks the court to establish the legal obligation of the father to support the child and set an appropriate amount of support. Once you have such an order, it can be enforced like any other child support order.</P>

<P><B>How to get child support</B><BR>
You will have to go through a legal process that has several steps:
<UL>
<LI>First you file a complaint or petition. Often this is done in family court, and may be as easy as filling out a form.
<LI>Next, you must establish that the other party is indeed the father or mother of your child, usually through a genetic test. If the other party does not consent to the test (or just concede that he or she is the parent), you will have to ask a court to order the test. (If you were married to the parent, then it may not be necessary to go through this step.)
<LI>Finally, if paternity or maternity is established, the court will set an appropriate amount of support. There will probably be a hearing during which both parties will be allowed to put on evidence. The judge will look at the income and assets of both parties and determine how much support should be paid.
</UL>

<P>Note: It is the obligation of both parents to support their child. A father who has custody can go after the biological mother for support.</P>

<P><B>How can a person collect the support if it's delinquent?</B><BR>
One of the biggest issues with child support is the difficulty in collecting it. Most states have set up programs for payment of child support (and alimony) through the court system so that if the payments are consistently late or not made at all, the state knows immediately and can act to collect the money or issue a warrant for the nonpayor's arrest. There are also private agencies that will seek out a non-paying parent for a share of the amount collected. If you are owed a substantial amount of money, this may be a good alternative for you.</P>

<P>If you know where the other parent works, you can apply to the court (usually it's family court) to order a wage execution or garnishment, which would deduct your support payment directly from his or her paycheck on a weekly basis. There are strict federal guidelines as to how much of a person's income can be taken, so it is possible that you may not get the entire amount of your support payment this way.</P>

<P>You can also have the nonpayor's income tax refunds and certain other Federal Government benefits withheld or frozen if support is delinquent.</P>

<P><B>Is it possible to collect if the person has moved to another state?</B><BR>
Yes. There is a procedure for collecting support if the payor lives in a state other than where the order to pay was entered. The law is called URESA, the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (sometimes RURESA for its Revised version), and it has been adopted by all 50 states and the United states' territories. Under URESA, an order of support issued in one state can be enforced in another state. To enforce an order under URESA, you have two options:</P>

<P>1. Registration:
<UL>
<LI>You register the court order that says the other parent has to pay support in the state where he or she now lives. You can call the family court in the appropriate county to find out what their local procedure is.
<LI>The other parent's state moves to "enforce" your order, which means it acts to make the parent pay.
</UL>

<P>This approach has a downside: The other parent can go to court in the new state and argue that he or she is being required to pay too much. The court is free to adjust the amount of support, which could result in your getting less money. If the other parent's state does this, your state has to accept the modification.</P>

<P>2. Enforcement Application:
<UL>
<LI>You go to the family court in your state and start an enforcement action. You should bring your original order for support with you, and you will probably have to fill out some forms.
<LI>Your state's child support enforcement agency then contacts the state where the other parent now lives.
<LI>The other parent's state cannot adjust the amount of support owed, but it can determine that the amount is too high and thus order that only a portion of it has to be paid.
</UL>

<P>With this option, your state does not have to accept the modification. So if the other parent pays you the amount ordered by his (or her) state, he will still owe you money in your state. If the amount owed piles up, your state may issue a warrant for his arrest. The failure to pay would show up on his credit report, and he could run into problems if he tried to buy property in your state. (Note: A more recent interstate law, the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, UIFSA, does not allow another state to alter a support order. As of July, 1995, 24 states have adopted the law, and the rest are expected to do so.)</P>

<P>You should consider both options carefully before you file. Unfortunately, the process tends to be slow and bureaucratic, but eventually you should be able to collect your support. If you can't, you should consult a lawyer to find out what other remedies may be available to you.</P>

<P><B>Ways to collect delinquent payments:</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Have money withheld from paychecks
<LI>Have probation department monitor payments
<LI>Have tax refunds withheld
<LI>URESA
<LI>Seize real estate or personal property
<LI>Require a cash bond be put down as a security deposit
</UL>

<P><B>Dealing with bureaucracies</B><BR>
Collecting unpaid support can be a bureaucratic nightmare involving lots of paperwork and requiring lots of patience, and you should do all you can to make the system work for you, not against you. Basically anything you can do to get someone within a bureaucracy to care about you and your case will help make the process easier.</P>

<P>Some pointers to help move things along:
<UL>
<LI>If you're dealing with the court system, check in regularly to see where your case stands. Always have your case or docket number available.
<LI>When dealing with people on the phone or in person, get their names so you can ask for them directly if you need to call check or follow up.
<LI>Notify the appropriate person or agency immediately if a problem arises. Don't put it off.
<LI>Be aggressive about asking for help and checking on the status of your case, but don't be obnoxious or rude--even though you may be frustrated and angry.

<h2>Dealing with Divorce Lawyers</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>Is a lawyer necessary?</B><BR>
No, but it's always best to be fully aware of all your legal rights. You may feel willing to give up your rights to property or pay more support in order to get out of your marriage as quickly as possible, but it's still advisable to have at least one consultation with a lawyer. When your emotions settle later, you may regret not having done so, especially if you didn't end up with your fair share.</P>

<P>Do-it-yourself forms are available, so if you and your spouse agree on most of the details, have few assets to divide and no custody issues to negotiate, then your divorce may be relatively easy to handle alone. However, if you have children or a significant amount of property to divide, then you likely will need a lawyer.</P>

<P>Also, if you are contemplating a divorce it may be in your interest to speak to a lawyer before taking any action, such as moving out or withholding support to your spouse, because doing so can have negative consequences further down the line. For instance, if you move out of the house your spouse could accuse you of abandonment. You could lose your share of the house, and you might also lose your right to custody of the children.</P>

<P>You and your spouse should always have separate lawyers since one lawyer cannot fairly represent the interests of both of you.</P>

<P><B>What should someone look for in a divorce lawyer?</B><BR>
Depending on the complexity of your case, you may not need a specialist in matrimonial law, although you may want one. Most general practitioners have enough knowledge of matrimonial law to handle a relatively simple case, or even a fairly difficult one, but you should make sure they've had some previous experience handling a divorce.</P>

<P>The most important thing that you need to look for in your attorney is someone you can trust and someone who you respect. Your lawyer will be privy to the most intimate personal and financial details of your married life. He or she will also be advising you as to what results to expect and how to proceed. You must trust his or her judgment and you must respect his or her knowledge and ability if the relationship is to work. You should also bear in mind that a divorce lawyer is not a marriage counsellor or a psychologist, and your emotional problems should be handled by an appropriate professional.</P>

<P><B>How do lawyer's fees work in a divorce?</B><BR>
You will generally be charged at an hourly rate, although some attorneys do have flat fees for simple divorces where there is no property distribution. The hourly rate of an individual attorney, as well as the overall cost of a divorce, will vary due to the location of the case and the experience of the practitioner. In general, a family law "specialist" will charge more than a general practitioner, and an experienced attorney will charge more than a newer attorney.</P>

<P>Some courts will require a spouse with the greater means to pay at least part of the counsel fees of the other spouse, but you should not count on that happening.</P>

<P>Most attorneys will require a specified sum up front as a minimum retainer to start the action, or begin negotiations on your behalf. The attorney's hourly rate will typically be charged against the retainer. Once the hours worked on your case exceed the retainer, you will be required to pay the balance when billed.</P>

<P>Unlike other types of cases, most states do not allow lawyers to use a contingency-fee arrangement in a divorce.</P>

<h2>Dividing Property</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>How is property divided in a separation or divorce?</B><BR>
If the couple has no prenuptial agreement, it depends on the laws of each state. Three basic systems govern how property is divided in a divorce. They are known as: 
<UL>
<LI>title
<LI>community property
<LI>equitable distribution
</UL> 

<P>Community Property States:
<UL>
<LI>Arizona
<LI>California
<LI>Idaho
<LI>Louisiana
<LI>Mississippi
<LI>Nevada
<LI>New Mexico
<LI>Texas
<LI>Washington
<LI>Wisconsin
</UL>

<P>Equitable Distribution States:<BR>
The remaining 40 states and the District of Columbia.</P>

<P>Important note: If you are married and acquire property in an equitable distribution state, your property could be converted if you move to a community property state. </P>

<P>The title system of distribution is not used anymore, because it is considered unfair. Under this system, each asset is divided based on whose name it is held in. Traditionally, since the husband was almost always the breadwinner, all assets such as cars, bank accounts, stocks, bonds, and even houses were bought by him and held in his name. Thus, he would end up with most of the assets in a divorce.</P>

<P>The unfairness of this system has led to its replacement in most states by equitable distribution. Here, the basic idea is that the property acquired during a marriage is jointly owned by both spouses. But equitable distribution does not necessarily mean equal distribution, and ownership does not automatically split fifty-fifty between the two. At the time of the divorce, a judge must decide how the property should be distributed. The distribution must be fair and just (equitable) and the judge must consider several factors, including: 
<UL>
<LI>the length of the marriage 
<LI>the age and health of the parties
<LI>their respective ability to earn in the future
<LI>any responsibility to minor children 
<LI>any other circumstances that are particular to their marriage
</UL>

<P>Forty states and the District of Columbia divide property in this manner. The specific details vary from state to state, but the general concept is the same. While equitable distribution is the system used in the majority of states, there are ten community property states. The idea of community property is that everything a husband and wife acquire once they are married is owned equally (fifty-fifty) by both of them, regardless of who provided the money to purchase the asset or whose name the asset is held in. If the couple divorces, their property is divided evenly under this system.</P>

<P><B>What about property each spouse owned before the marriage?</B><BR>
In most equitable distribution and community property systems, that property remains separate and does not get split during the divorce. The same is true of any personal gifts or inheritances a spouse receives during the marriage. However, if you don't keep your personal assets separate, they may be converted into marital property. Then your spouse may be entitled to a share. For example, if you receive a $10,000 inheritance and keep it in your own personal account, then that is your separate property. However, if you deposit the money into the joint account you share with your spouse, then it would probably be considered marital property. (Note: the state of Connecticut is one exception to the standard. There the law does not make a distinction for property acquired prior to the marriage.)</P>

<P>You can sometimes convert a separate asset into joint property even if you don't commingle it with marital property. For example, say you inherit 10,000 shares of IBM stock from your parents during the marriage, and you keep those shares in your name only, and you never do anything with that stock. It remains yours, and if you get divorced your spouse will not get any of it.</P>

<P>But perhaps you decide that this is your big opportunity to start playing in the stock market, and you begin to devote several hours a week to trading, buying and selling shares, and reviewing financial and business journals. You do well and the value of that inheritance has increased by $50,000 due to your own efforts. Even if you keep this money in a separate account in your name and you never use any of the money to benefit your family, the $50,000 increase in the value of your stock portfolio, which resulted from your personal effort (as opposed to any appreciation in its value earned while it sat there), may be considered marital property that can be distributed.</P>

<P>In another example, say that several years before your marriage you bought a house. It's in your name, and is considered a non-marital asset. After your marriage, you continue to live in the house and pay the mortgage from your employment income, which is considered a marital asset. Thus you are mixing a marital asset with a non-marital asset. In some states, that mixture will cause your house to become marital property that can be divided between the parties. In other states, the part of the house that you had paid for before the marriage will remain a non-marital asset, while the other part will be a marital asset that can be divided between you and your spouse.</P>

<P>When you and your spouse are both owners of a property (such as the house you live in), then part of the value is yours and part of the value is your spouse's. Therefore, if you want to keep the house for yourself, you will have to trade off certain other assets in order to equal the balance.</P>

<P><B>What if the house was owned by one spouse before the marriage?</B><BR>
Things that you owned prior to the marriage do remain separate property. However, in an Equitable Distribution state, it may not be fair to exclude your spouse from sharing in the value of the house, especially if your spouse has helped pay the mortgage or has made improvements in the house. Also, if you bought the house specifically in contemplation of the marriage and the title just never got transferred into joint names, a court will usually find that it was intended to be a marital asset and will probably give your spouse a fair share.</P>

<P><B>How does a couple identify their assets?</B><BR>
The easiest assets (items of value) to identify are the tangible things that you own. These include:
<UL>
<LI>your home 
<LI>furniture, including lamps and rugs 
<LI>appliances
<LI>works of art
<LI>vehicles, including cars, bicycles, boats, and snowmobiles
<LI>money (cash in the bank)
<LI>stocks, bonds, and other investments
<LI>pensions and retirement accounts
<LI>personally-owned businesses and partnerships. 
</UL>

<P>There are also assets that do not have a physical existence. These are known as intangible assets. An example of an intangible asset would be the patent on an invention or something known as "celebrity goodwill," which is a person's ability to sell his or her image. (This typically applies to famous people, like Michael Jordan, who can make a lot of money because of their notoriety.)</P>

<P>Usually one of the most significant assets to divide is your real property. Real property is essentially land and all the things that are attached to it. If you own your own home, you own real property. Anything that is not real property is personal property and personal property is anything that isn't nailed down, dug into or built onto the land. Thus, your house is part of your real property, but your dining room set is not. (Note to those who own cooperative apartments: They are generally considered personal property.)</P>

<P><B>Would a professional degree be considered an asset?</B><BR>
Sometimes. Most states don't consider professional degrees and licenses as marital property, although if you have supported your spouse and put him or her through school, you may be entitled to some form of reimbursement that will give you back the investment that you made in your spouse's future. However, some states, such as New York, do consider a professional license an asset, and in New York a spouse will be entitled to a share of its value. While it can be difficult to place a value on the license, these states will typically evaluate the expected lifetime earnings potential of the license holder to make the calculation.</P>

<P><B>What about life insurance and pension plans?</B><BR>
A life insurance plan is an asset to which the parties have contributed during the marriage, but it is an asset which, again, is difficult to value because it will not be received until the insured person dies. Typically, there are two kinds of life insurance policies: term insurance that pays death benefits and has no present value, and a policy with a cash surrender value. A state may consider the cash surrender value of any life insurance policy to be marital property that can be divided (your policy will state whether it has a cash surrender value).</P>

<P>A pension plan is also an asset of the marriage. Depending on the law in your state, even if you are not vested in your pension and cannot collect from it or borrow against it for many years, the court may still consider it an asset of the marriage.</P>

<P><B>Is one spouse entitled to a share of the business of the other spouse?</B><BR>
Yes. If your spouse owns his or her own business, you are entitled to some share in the value of that business, although it is unlikely that you will get a piece of the business itself. If the business existed prior to the marriage, you will only be entitled to share in the increase in the value of the business since the marriage. If the business was set up during the marriage, you will be entitled to share in the entire value of the business.</P>

<P><B>How is the value determined?</B><BR>
It's an extremely complex procedure that usually requires the help of an expert whose services will probably cost several thousand dollars. Don't expect that you will receive pieces of machinery or inventory, or that you will be given a controlling share of the stocks of the corporation. Instead, since it is really your spouse's business (and presumably he or she wants to run it without your input) you probably will receive a cash buyout or the equivalent amount in marital assets. Even if you want a piece of the business, it is unlikely that a judge would give it to you, since that would be very disruptive to the flow of the business.</P>

<h2>Separation Agreements</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <A HREF="store">online store</A>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>Should a couple that separates have a written agreement?</B><BR>
If they agree that a separation is the best thing for them, they could simply live apart without any formal agreement for as long as they want. However, they may wish to have a separation agreement in order to protect them in case things do not remain harmonious. A separation agreement is especially advisable if one of the spouses does not work and will be caring for children on a full-time basis. The risks are simply too great that a spouse may change his or her mind about the amount of money paid for child support. Also, an agreement is helpful if disputes arise about personal property and bills on the marital residence.</P>

<P>As with any other agreement, you can write it yourself, but at some point you should consult a lawyer to make sure you have covered all the contingencies and that you are getting an appropriate amount of support based on the laws of your state. Whether or not you consult with a lawyer, it is always best to put your agreements in writing and make sure both of you sign and date the agreement. You may even want to have witnesses or a notary so that there will be no question at a later time about the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement.</P>

<P>You are not required to file the separation agreement with a court.</P>

<P>Some of the issues a separation agreement should address:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>the right of each spouse to live apart
<LI>child custody
<LI>child support
<LI>visitation rights
<LI>spousal support
<LI>medical and dental expenses
<LI>children's education expenses
<LI>children's recreational expenses, such as camp or afterschool music and dance lessons
<LI>division of property, with a complete listing of the income and assets of both spouses
<LI>life insurance
<LI>income tax
<LI>divorce
<LI>any other issues that are of importance to you
</UL>

<P>A separation agreement may be declared invalid if either of the parties failed to make a full disclosure of his or her assets. Also, there are certain rights that cannot be given away, such as the right to receive child support if you have custody of the children.</P>

<h2>Stepchildren</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.<P></P>

<P><B>What are a person's obligations to stepchildren?</B><BR>
Every parent has a legal responsibility to support his or her own biological children. Thus, stepparents have no independent obligation towards their stepchildren. Of course, if the children are living with you, you will probably end up providing for some of their support, since you will be paying rent or a mortgage, and you will undoubtedly drive them around in a car that you bought for yourself. However, this does not mean that you are legally obligated to provide these things, and if you and your new spouse separate or divorce, you will have no obligation to pay support directly.</P>

<P>The only exception to this is when you essentially "step into the shoes" of that child's other parent and become the sole provider of support. Say, for example, that your new wife was deserted by her ex-husband several years ago. She marries you, and you essentially become her 10-year-old son's parent. You may be obligated to support him if this marriage fails. Generally, the determination will depend on several factors, including:
<UL>
<LI>whether her first husband provides financial support to the child
<LI>the length of your second marriage
<LI>the intentions you and your second spouse have about the new family's relationships.
</ul></P>

<P><B>Can a stepparent adopt the children?</B><BR>
Typically, you will not be able to adopt your stepchildren without the consent of their other biological parent. Divorced parents do not surrender their parental rights. However, if your new spouse is a widow or widower, or if the stepchild was abandoned or, in some states, born out of wedlock and without any substantial ties to the other parent, then you probably can adopt. If you choose to do so, you would need to see a lawyer about getting the legal process started. You will have to appear in court before a judge; it is not the kind of thing that you can simply do on your own on paper.</P>

<H2>Court-ordered Mediation When<BR>You Can't Agree, but Want to Talk</H2>

<P><B>Massachusetts Family Law<BR>
Sponsored by: <A HREF="sooho.html">Law Offices of Sharyn T. Sooho</A></B></P>

<P>In the early eighties, many divorcing couples chose private mediation. They hired a neutral third party to facilitate discussions ranging from custody and visitation to division of assets and alimony. As mediation became more widespread, courts began experimenting with alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques since the adversarial process drove parties further apart and discouraged future compliance with court orders.</P>

<P>Court-ordered mediation became popular and court personnel were trained as mediators. In theory, parties would no longer be able to delegate decision-making by hiding behind lawyers and would start realizing the importance of settling their cases without going to trial.</P>

<P>Although mediation has its advantages, argumentative or rigid people are not good candidates for mediation. Skilled mediators assess the parties at the first meeting and may refuse to handle a case.</P>

<H2>What is Divorce Mediation?</H2>

<P><B>Massachusetts Family Law<BR>
Sponsored by: <A HREF="sooho.html">Law Offices of Sharyn T. Sooho</A></B></P>

<P>The husband and wife jointly hire a mediator, often a lawyer by training. The mediator will not act as the attorney for the parties, but as a neutral facilitator. During a series of meetings, the couple and the mediator work out a mutually satisfactory plan covering the children's living arrangements the financial needs of each member of the family, the home and other assets of the parties. Both are free to consult with a lawyer at any time. The process is designed to reduce the adversarial element often encountered in divorce proceedings. You may save time and money, too.</P>

<P>Once an agreement is reached, the mediator writes a draft for the husband and wife to review with outside counsel before signing. With a completed and signed separation agreement, the couple is free to proceed with a divorce action in court.</P>

<P>Write to the editors and we will be happy to provide a list of mediators.</P>

<H2>Domestic Torts</H2>

<P><B>Massachusetts Family Law<BR>
Sponsored by: <A HREF="sooho.html">Law Offices of Sharyn T. Sooho</A></B></P>

<P>In 1982, after the Heacocks were separated, they had a violent argument on the telephone. Mr. Heacock went to Ms. Heacock's home. When she refused to let him in, he broke a glass door panel, grabbed her by the arm, and repeatedly caused her to hit her head on the door frame. Ms. Heacock filed for divorce. Unbeknownst to Mr. Heacock, she also filed a civil suit against him in another court for monetary damages, claiming she suffered from traumatic epilepsy.</P>

<P>In 1991 the Massachusetts Appeals Court finally ruled that Ms. Heacock could not sue her former husband because she allowed her divorce case to end without disclosing to Mr. Heacock or the divorce court that she was seeking an additional monetary award in another court. The Appeals Court implied that the divorce court should have heard the divorce case and tort claim simultaneously, leaving us to wonder whether the divorce court would have awarded more than the usual alimony and property to Ms. Heacock.</P>

<H2>Moving Away Cases</H2>

<P><B>Massachusetts Family Law<BR>
Sponsored by: <A HREF="sooho.html">Law Offices of Sharyn T. Sooho</A></B></P>

<P>Moving from Massachusetts after divorce is no simple matter if you have minor children. Unless your former spouse agrees, you cannot take the children without the courts permission.</P>

<P>The usual case involves remarriage or new job opportunities for the custodial parent, who argues that the move is "clearly advantageous." The parent opposing the move argues that the children will lose their close emotional ties to the Massachusetts parent.</P>

<P>If you and your former spouse disagree about the move:
<UL>
<LI>allow at least six months to settle or litigate.
<LI>hire a child psychologist to make a recommendation in the best interests of the children.
<LI>fund a travel account for the children wherever they end up living to ensure time with each parent.</UL>

<H2>The Business of Marriage: Prenuptial Agreements</H2>

<P><B>Massachusetts Family Law<BR>
Sponsored by: <A HREF="sooho.html">Law Offices of Sharyn T. Sooho</A></B></P>

<P>If you  plan to remarry, insist on a prenuptial agreement. Courts will enforce these agreements if: 
<UL> 
<LI>You provide full and accurate financial disclosure. 
<LI>The agreement is fair and reasonable when signed. 
<LI>The agreement is fair and reasonable at time of death or divorce. 
</UL>

<P>What is "fair and  reasonable?"  Judges may interpret this standard differently, but  any radical departure from commonly accepted notions of fairness are met with resistance. For example, don't expect to keep everything if your spouse is on welfare. Agreements are more easily enforced if you:
<UL>
<LI>Never use the same attorney.
<LI>Allow your fiance enough time to review your financial statements with a  lawyer and financial advisor.
<LI>Give your fiance ample information on hard-to-value assets like a family business or trust fund.
<LI>Do not address custody and child support.
<LI>Provide life insurance for your spouse.
</UL>

<H2>Visiting the Holiday Blues</H2>

<P><B>Massachusetts Family Law<BR>
Sponsored by: <A HREF="sooho.html">Law Offices of Sharyn T. Sooho</A></B></P>

<P>The holidays are stressful for divorced parents and their children. Typically,
lawyers recommend a "flip-flop" visitation schedule. Dad spends Thanksgiving
with the children and Mom keeps them for Christmas. The following year, the
parties trade.</P>

<P>Some families opt for the "split" holiday in which the children spend a half day
at each parent's home. The frenzy can be maddening; children eat two dinners or
none.</P>

<P>A few parents try a "permanent" holiday schedule. Mom and Dad agree that the
children will spend every Thanksgiving with Mom. Dad spends every Christmas Eve
and morning with the children.</P>

<P>After the divorce, Dad remarries and wants the children to spend Thanksgiving
with him and his new family. Mom also wants the children to wake up at her home
on Christmas morning. These requests are predictable, but parents often fail
to build in a mechanism for change. We value parents' ability to negotiate and
settle their differences. When that is not possible, however, the court will
entertain a request to change an existing court order or agreement if consistent
with the children's best interest.</P>

<P>Minimize future disputes as you plan your post-divorce visitation schedule:
<UL>
<LI>Consult a child psychologist about the needs of children at different ages.
<LI>Anticipate change as your children grow or as your own circumstances vary, such as changes in health and income.
<LI>Opt for mediation.
<LI>If you must return to court, ask the judge to appoint a guardian ad litem (person acting in place of the children). The guardian, usually a mental health professional, will interview the children so the court hears the guardian's testimony instead of the children's.
<LI>Do not wait until the last minute to change holiday  schedules.
<LI>Be flexible.
<LI>Above all, do not put children in the middle.</UL>

She makes no decisions; rather, she helps the parties reachtheir own decisions. She is skilled at helping individuals carefullyconsider their goals, their interests, and their options.

Why would I want to mediate my divorce?</h3><blockquote>Traditionally, when a couple is considering divorce, each hires his andher own lawyer. The lawyers then try to work out the terms of asettlement -- with letters, phone calls, legal documents and courthearings. If the lawyers and parties don't agree, they take the case totrial in court.<p>The advantage of this adversarial system -- each attorney trying to getas much as possible for his client -- is that both husband and wife havethe help of a knowledgeable legal expert who's doing everything possibleto protect that party's interests.<p>The downside of this system is that it's expensive and tends to increaseany existing tension between the parties, who often end up angrier ateach other than when they began. Their children may also be caught up inthe conflict and injured by it. The adversarial court system assumesthat the parties are enemies; this assumption can be very destructivewhen applied to families.<p>If conflict escalates, so does the cost. The attorney's meetings withyou, possible witnesses, and experts; telephone calls; letters; hearings-- it all adds up to a lot of attorney time and a lot of expense.<p>Mediation can drastically reduce both the hostility and the cost of yourdivorce. It also gives you the power to make your own decisions --rather than allow lawyers and judges to make them. And it gives youprivacy; the discussions are in your mediator's office, not a publiccourtroom.</blockquote></P><P><B><I>Any answers posted are for your information only and are not intended toconstitute legal advice.</I></B></P><P><a href=/legalhelp/qanda/james/index.html#tab><B><I>Main Page</I></B></a><P><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/stroke.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=547><BR><A HREF="/map/bottom.map"><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/bottom.gif" ISMAP ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM BORDER=0 WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=30></A><BR><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/rights.gif" ALT="Copyright 1995 by the Courtroom Television Network.

What does a mediated divorce look like?</h3><blockquote>The two of you together meet with the mediator, who guides you throughthe legal issues in your divorce and helps you reach agreements. If yourmediator is an experienced family law attorney, she'll be familiar withthe legal issues that need to be addressed and will help you considerthe various options available to you. She may even draft the necessarypaperwork.<p>When you begin mediation, you may be angry with each other or you may befriendly. You may have agreed on all the issues or on none of them. Itdoesn't matter. The mediator will take you where she finds you and helpyou reach informed, reasonable agreements. She keeps you on track, helpsyou listen to each other, brings up legal issues you may not havethought of, and helps you work through the rough spots and still reachagreements.<p>Sometimes couples decide to try mediation after they've already begunlitigation. They've hired attorneys and possibly had hearings or begunformal discovery. Mediation is still a good way to avoid escalating yourlawsuit further. You can mediate at anytime -- even the day before yougo to court.<p>If you've both retained attorneys, you'll probably bring those lawyerswith you to the mediation session to help you evaluate the other side'soffers and propose counter-offers. Although this method is moreexpensive because you're paying your lawyers as well as the mediator,it's still far less expensive than trying your case in court.</blockquote></P><P><B><I>Any answers posted are for your information only and are not intended toconstitute legal advice.</I></B></P><P><a href=/legalhelp/qanda/james/index.html#tab><B><I>Main Page</I></B></a><P><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/stroke.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=547><BR><A HREF="/map/bottom.map"><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/bottom.gif" ISMAP ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM BORDER=0 WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=30></A><BR><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/rights.gif" ALT="Copyright 1995 by the Courtroom Television Network.

If we mediate our divorce, do we still have to have our own attorneys?</h3><blockquote>You don't need to "retain" an attorney -- that means paying a lot ofmoney for the lawyer to sign your pleadings [court papers] and, inessence, promise to represent you throughout the proceedings. But you<STRONG>do</strong> need to consult with a lawyer to be sure that youunderstand your legal rights and make informed decisions.<p>Remember, the mediator is neutral. She doesn't represent you or yourspouse. Because she's neutral, she cannot give you legal advice. She mayfeel comfortable sharing legal information with you -- such as childsupport guidelines, property rights in divorce, and other legal matters-- but she may not be comfortable suggesting how those laws apply toyour case. And she certainly won't want to recommend to you what youshould or shouldn't do.<p>A consulting attorney can sit down with you and make sure you know whatyou're doing. He can tell you how he thinks you would fare in court ifyou don't agree in mediation. He can advise you as to whether you shouldaccept an offer in mediation. He can review any paperwork the mediatordrafts to be sure your rights are protected. If your mediator doesn'twant to draft the legal papers, your lawyers may draft the formaldocuments.</blockquote></P><P><B><I>Any answers posted are for your information only and are not intended toconstitute legal advice.</I></B></P><P><a href=/legalhelp/qanda/james/index.html#tab><B><I>Main Page</I></B></a><P><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/stroke.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=547><BR><A HREF="/map/bottom.map"><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/bottom.gif" ISMAP ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM BORDER=0 WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=30></A><BR><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/rights.gif" ALT="Copyright 1995 by the Courtroom Television Network.

How much does it cost to mediate my divorce?</h3><blockquote>Your mediator will charge by the hour, so the cost depends on you. Howcomplicated are your legal issues and how agreeable are you? However, nomatter how complicated or contentious your divorce, it will almostcertainly be less expensive if you resolve your differences inmediation. It's far more efficient because you make decisions witheveryone sitting at the table together -- instead of through numerousattorney letters and phone calls. And because it's usually friendlier,you don't waste time and run up costs due to anger andmisunderstandings.<p>You'll also have the cost of your consulting attorney, but because youprobably won't need much of his time, that expense should be minor.<p></blockquote></P><P><B><I>Any answers posted are for your information only and are not intended toconstitute legal advice.</I></B></P><P><a href=/legalhelp/qanda/james/index.html#tab><B><I>Main Page</I></B></a><P><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/stroke.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=547><BR><A HREF="/map/bottom.map"><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/bottom.gif" ISMAP ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM BORDER=0 WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=30></A><BR><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/rights.gif" ALT="Copyright 1995 by the Courtroom Television Network.

They have the authority and responsibility to stabilize you. In an emergency situation, the law presumes that the patient has given consent to whatever treatment is necessary to save his or her life. This means stopping bleeding, suturing wounds, giving transfusions, setting bones, doing CPR, etc.<p>If you are a minor, your parents have the legal authority to make decisions for you.<p>If you have prepared a living will -- a legal document that outlines what procedures you do and do not want performed for you in the event that you are incapacitated -- you will essentially be making decisions for yourself. In other words, your living will specifically tells the doctor which life-sustaining medical treatments you will or will not consent to if you are in the medical circumstances established by the state legislature.<p>If you have prepared a health care power of attorney, the person you name as your agent is the person the doctor will look to for medical decisions on your behalf.<p>If you have not prepared any medical treatment decision document, and your accident occurs in a state with a "family consent statute," the doctor will look for decisions from the person who has the highest priority among those listed in the statute. In most states, the priority list is first spouse, then adult children, then parents, then siblings, etc.<p>Outside of these circumstances, the answers get more fuzzy.<p><p></blockquote></P><P><B><I>Any answers posted are for your information only and are not intended toconstitute legal advice.</I></B></P><P><a href=/legalhelp/qanda/hurme/index.html#tab><B><I>Main Page</I></B></a><P><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/stroke.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=547><BR><A HREF="/map/bottom.map"><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/bottom.gif" ISMAP ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM BORDER=0 WIDTH=533 HEIGHT=30></A><BR><IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/rights.gif" ALT="Copyright 1995 by the Courtroom Television Network.

To avoid potential conflicts at your bedside, talk to your loved ones now about your wishes and try to resolve any differences of opinion.

The laws for living wills vary by state. The following is a Kansas
Living Will Declaration. It was provided by Legal Counsel for the
Elderly, a department of the American Association of Retired Persons
<P><HR><P>
<PRE>

Kansas Living Will Declaration 

Declaration made  ________ this day of , 19 ___

I, __________________, being of sound mind, willfully and voluntarily
make known my desires that my dying shall not be artificially
prolonged under the circumstances set forth below, and do hereby
declare:

If at any time I should have an incurable injury, disease, or illness
certified to be a terminal condition by two physicians who have
personally examined me, one of whom shall be my attending physician,
and the physicians have determined that my death will occur whether
or not life-sustaining procedures are utilized and where the
application of life-sustaining procedures would serve only to
artificially prolong the dying process, I direct that such procedures
be withheld or withdrawn, and that I be permitted to die naturally
with only the administration of medication or the performance of any
medical procedure deemed necessary to provide me with comfort care. 

Other directions: 

_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

In the absence of my ability to give directions regarding the use of
such life-sustaining procedures, it is my intention that this
declaration shall be honored by my family and physician(s) as the
final expression of my legal right to refuse medical or surgical
treatment and accept the consequences from such refusal. 

I understand the full import of this declaration and I am emotionally
and mentally competent to make this declaration. 

Signed _____________________________________________________
Address ____________________________________________________

The declarant has been personally known to me and I believe him or
her to be of sound mind. I did not sign the declarant's signature
above for or at the direction of the declarant. I am not related to
the declarant by blood or marriage, entitled to any portion of the
estate of the declarant according to the laws of intestate succession
or under any will of declarant or codicil thereto, or directly
financially responsible for the declarant's medical care.

<UL><P>The Trial of the Century is over, but the murder mystery remains...Did O.J. Do It?<IMG SRC="cover.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="100" BORDER="0" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="20"></P>

<P>This compelling investigation into the unsolved murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman focuses on the literal timeframe when the murders occurred--the "killing time," sometime between 10 and 11 p.m., June 12, 1994. In a groundbreaking scientific forensic investigation, material from the crime scene is analyzed to produce different scenarios of the murders, each with its own timeline of evidence and players.</P>

<P>Author Donald Freed finds the perfect blend of suspense and inquiry as he takes us through each retelling of the murders, beginning with the partisan theories of the prosecution and defense, and why each is flawed. Woven throughout are explosive information, interviews, and countless signs of both conspiracy and cover-up. From what the lawyers didn't tell you and the press didn't report; to insights from a "deep throat" source; to organized crime and drugs in Brentwood, <B><I>Killing Time</I></B> will make you reassess what you thought you knew and explore areas you never imagined, such as:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Who left the evidence found in Nicole's garage?
	<LI>What happened to the prosecution's double assassin theory?
	<LI>Who was Nicole's other gentleman caller that night?
	<LI>Why was the constellation of murders around Ronald Goldman not explored?
	<LI>Could Ron have been the target?
</UL>

<P>Is the case open or closed? For those wanting to develop their own scenario, shocking new leads and a blank timeline are provided. In the pages of this public "court," scores of questions are left for you to answer, because you are the jury.</P>

EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Good morning, Mr. Simpson.

A: Good morning.

Q: My name is Daniel Petrocelli. I represent plaintiff Frederick Goldman
in this lawsuit against you. Do you understand that you are under oath?

A: Yes.

Q: You may have to speak up so that the folks down at the end of the
table can hear you. Have you ever testified under oath before?

A: Yes.

Q: You understand that even though you're in our law office today, that
the testimony that you give under oath here is subject to the same
penalty of perjury as though you were testifying in a court of law?

A: Yes.

Q: How many times have you testified under oath before?

A: I'm not sure, but I'd say three or four times.

Q: Have you ever given a deposition before?

A: Yes.

Q: How many times?

A: I believe twice.

Q: All before the death of Nicole and the death of Ron Goldman?

Q: During those two times that you gave depositions, you understood you
were under oath?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you tell the truth in those depositions?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you say anything untrue?

A: I don't believe so, no.

Q: You told the truth. Right?

A: The best I knew it.

MR. BAKER: That's enough. That's enough.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: And have you ever testified at a trial?

A: Yes.

Q: When?

A: Late '60s, early '70s.

Q: What kind of case was it?

A: One I believe was a criminal case, and one was a lawsuit.

Q: Did they involve you?

A: No.

Q: You were just a witness?

A: Yes.

Q: And you told the truth in those criminal cases?

A: The best I knew it.

Q: Tell me who the parties were.

MR. BAKER: I am going to object. Instruct him not to answer. It's
irrelevant and immaterial.

MR. PETROCELLI: What I would like to do is get a copy of the transcript
of his testimony.

MR. BAKER: It's irrelevant, immaterial. Instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Now, is this the first time you're testifying
under oath since the death of Nicole and the death of Ron Goldman?

A: Yes.

Q: So you've never been questioned under oath about the events
surrounding Ron and Nicole's death. Is that right?

MR. BAKER: That's been asked and answered. Instruct him not to answer
the question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: When you gave an interview on Ross Becker
recently, you were not under oath. Correct?

A: Correct.

Q: Did you tell the truth?

A: Best that I knew it, yes.

Q: Would you have said anything differently if you were under oath?

MR. BAKER: It's argumentative. Don't answer that question.

MR. PETROCELLI: Are you instructing him?

MR. BAKER: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can we have a stipulation that if you instruct him not
to answer, that he will abide by your instructions?

MR. BAKER: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you. Q: Did you-- you spoke in other elements of
that video besides the Becker interview. Correct?

A: Correct.

Q: And did you tell the truth during the other times that you spoke on
the video?

A: Best that I knew it, yes.

Q: And would you have said anything differently if you were under oath?

A: I don't think so, no.

Q: Now, you recall giving a statement to the Los Angeles Police
Department on June 13?

A: Yes.

Q: Were you under oath?

A: I don't believe so.

Q: Did you tell the truth?

A: Best as I could remember it--

Q: Would you have said--

A:--at the time, yes.

Q: --the same thing--

MR. BAKER: Just a minute.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm sorry.

MR. BAKER: Let him finish his answer.

MR. PETROCELLI: I apologize, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: Go ahead and finish your answer.

THE WITNESS: As best as I could at that time, yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Would you have said anything differently at the
time if you were under oath?

A: At the time, no.

Q: I would like to talk a little bit about preparing for the giving of
testimony. You recently participated in this making of a video that is
going to be released soon. Correct?

A: Yes.

Q: And you talked in that video about the events and circumstances of
Ron and Nicole's deaths. Correct?

A: I answered the questions that were asked me.

Q: Okay. But the subject matter of that video was your side of the story
with respect to the deaths of Ron and Nicole. Right?

MR. BAKER: I am going to object. That's a characterization that you're
making.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You may answer.

A: I answered the questions that were asked me, basically, yes.

Q: But it was about the deaths of Ron and Nicole, generally speaking.
Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Is that the only time--And there were video tape machines and tape
recorders recording what you were saying. Right?  A: Yes.

Q: Now, is that the only time that you have been recorded discussing the
facts and circumstances surrounding Ron and Nicole's deaths?

MR. BAKER: Don't answer that question unless you exclude anything that
was done vis--vis your attorneys. Any questions that he puts to you, I
don't want you to answer and include anything that was done with your
attorneys.

MR. PETROCELLI: I would like to know if he is excluding anything.

MR. BAKER: He is going to exclude everything that was done with and
through and by his attorneys.

MR. PETROCELLI: But all I am saying, Mr. Baker, so that we know whether
or not there is a relevant contact with an attorney where we might want
to attack the assertion of the attorney-client privilege, we have to
know the basic foundational facts. That's all I'm saying.

MR. BAKER: I understand what you're saying, and I'm not assenting to
that, and we are not going to allow you to inquire as to what he did
with his attorneys, whether he was taped, videotaped or anything else.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I am going to inquire into that, and I haven't
asked so far about any communications. I have simply asked for the mere
existence of such recordings, if they do exist.

MR. BAKER: And I am going to instruct him not to answer that, and you
can certify it, and we can argue that point with the court.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

Q: Let me get back to my question: Other than this recent video, have
you ever been recorded on videotape or audiotape discussing facts and
circumstances and events surrounding the deaths of Ron and Nicole?

MR. BAKER: And I want you to answer that, other than anything you did
with your attorneys.

THE WITNESS: Other than anything that I did with my attorney, not that I
knew of.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: And what about with respect to things you did with
your attorneys?

MR. BAKER: Could you be more vague?

MR. PETROCELLI: No.

MR. BAKER: I don't know what the question is.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: The question is: Have you ever participated in any events or any
tapings in which you discussed the events and circumstances surrounding
Ron and Nicole's deaths in the presence of your attorneys?

MR. BAKER: I instruct him not to answer that question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What attorneys were present during such tapings?

MR. BAKER: And I instruct him not to answer that question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you prepare for the possibility of testifying
at your criminal trial?

A: When you say--I don't understand when you say "prepare."

Q: Did you -- Were you tape-recorded or videotaped?

MR. BAKER: Same objection. If it has --if you were there with your
attorneys and it was pursuant to the instruction of your attorneys, I
don't want you to answer that question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did a lawyer named Christina Arguendas subject you
to a practice or mock cross-examination?

MR. BAKER: Don't answer that question. I'll instruct him not to answer.

MR. PETROCELLI: What are the grounds of these objections?

MR. BAKER: I think it's pretty evident.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's not to me. I just would like the record to be
clear.

MR. BAKER: It's attorney-client privilege and attorney work product
privilege.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

Q: Is Christina Arguendas an attorney that has ever worked for you in
the past two years?

A: I don't know.

Q: You --

A: The name really doesn't mean anything to me.

Q: Doesn't mean anything to you?

A: No

Q: Did such a person--do you know whether such a person subjected you to
a practice or mock cross-examination?

MR. BAKER: I will instruct you not to answer again. That's based on
attorney work product and attorney-client privilege.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Have you ever been cross-examined about the facts
and circumstances of the death of Ron and Nicole by a person who you did
not know?

MR. BAKER: If you did not know and you did not know they were an
attorney, you can answer that question.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I'm a little lost here.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: In other words, I am trying to find out if anybody
ever subjected you to a cross-examination when the person was not acting
as your attorney, other than this video that just happened. Can you
answer that yes or no, please?

MR. BAKER: That assumes that an attorney that was hired through another
attorney of his is not-- may or may not be his attorney, and I am not
going to allow him to answer that question.

MR. PETROCELLI: Same grounds: Attorney-client and work product
objections?

MR. BAKER: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You took notes during the criminal trial?

A: Yeah, at times.

Q: Where are those notes?

A: I don't know.

Q: What did you do with them?

A: I have absolutely no idea.

Q: Who did you give them to?

A: I don't know when I packed up--I don't know.

Q: You don't know what you did with them?

A: No.

Q: At the end of each day did you have a routine where you gave your
notes to somebody or saved them in some way?

A: No.

Q: Did you take them back with you to the jail cell?

A: Yes.

Q: And when you left, when you were released, did you take the notes
with you?

A: I believe some of them, I must have.

Q: Did you give them to anyone? Such as your attorneys?

A: No.

Q: Or anyone else?

A: No.

Q: Your assistant?

A: No.

Q: So right now as you testify today, you don't know where those notes
are?

A: No.

Q: Do you know if they exist?

A: I hope so.

Q: Why do you hope so?

A: I just hope so.

Q: Did you give them to someone for safekeeping?

A: No.

Q: Do you know if they are in your house?

A: No, I don't know.

Q: Did you meet with anyone to prepare for this deposition?

MR. BAKER: Other than your attorneys.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Other than your attorneys.

A: No.

Q: Did you meet with your attorneys?

MR. BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Who are the attorney that you met with to prepare
for this deposition?

MR. BAKER: Don't answer that either.

MR. PETROCELLI: Are these instructions not to answer?

MR. BAKER: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: And based on what grounds?

MR. BAKER: On attorney-client and attorney work product privilege.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

Q: Were there any persons who were not lawyers, other than yourself, of
course, present during sessions in preparation for this deposition?

MR. BAKER: Assuming there were sessions in preparation for this
deposition.

MR. PETROCELLI: Correct.

THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: All persons present other than yourself were lawyers?

A: Assuming that-

Q: Such preparation sessions occurred.

A: Yes. Yes.

Q: Is that correct?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. Do you have a copy of any of the videotaped materials that were
used to make this soon-to-be-released video?

A: No.

Q: You have nothing?

A: Nothing.

Q: Do you have the final product?

A: No.

Q: Have you seen it?

A: No.

Q: Do you have any of the script materials?

MR. BAKER: Well, that assumes there are script materials.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Were there scripts prepared by writers to prepare
for the making of this video?

A: Given to me?

Q: That you saw, not necessarily given to you.

A: Saw, yes.

Q: Do you have copies of those scripts?

A: They weren't for me. No, I don't.

Q: You don't have anything?

A: No.

Q: What is the name of this soon-to be- released video?

A: "O.J. Tells," I believe.

Q: "O.J. Tells"?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. So you have-

A: That's the phone number also.

Q: Excuse me?

A: That's the phone number: 1-800-OJTELLS.

Q: I see. So you--right now you have nothing in your possession with
respect to this video "O.J. Tells." Is that right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Do your lawyers?

A: I don't know.

Q: Do any of your representatives have any of these materials relating
to the video in their possession?

MR. BAKER: I don't know what you mean by "representatives." I will take
the suspense out of it that the lawyers do not have a copy of any of the
tapes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

Q: Mr. Blasier was present during the production of this video. Correct?

A: Correct.

Q: And Mr. Blasier prepared a list of topics or points to be covered in
the course of making this video. Correct?

A: I would say that's not correct, no.

Q: Can you explain to me?

MR. BAKER: Explain to you what? He just-- Don't explain. Just answer his
questions.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did Mr. Blasier or anyone else hand out a list of
points to be covered in the video?

MR. BAKER: Well, to the extent that Blasier talked to him about any
points, I still believe and instruct him not to answer that that's going
to be based on the attorney-client privilege. Mr. Blasier is an
attorney, and he is of counsel in this matter. So I instruct him not to
answer that question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: When Mr. Blasier was participating in the making
of this video, did you understand that he was doing so in his role as
attorney of record in this case?

A: Yes.

Q: And you asked him to do that for that reason?

A: Yes.

Q: And he had discussions with you from time to time?

A: Discussions, yes.

Q: And as part of those discussions, did other members of the production
crew participate?

A: Some subjects, yes.

Q: What kind of subjects?

A: Locating blood drops, where the tags should go, and where various
evidence, I guess, items were found.

Q: What was the name of the director?

A: I believe Larry Schiller.

Q: And the name of the producer?

A: Tony Hoffman.

Q: The name of the writer or writers?

A: I don't recall.

Q: And there were meetings and discussions involving the producer, the
director and the writers from time to time. Correct?

A: I would assume so.

Q: And you attended some of those. Correct?

A: Yes.

Q: And Mr. Blasier attended and participated in some of those. Correct?

A: Yes.

Q: And at some point didn't somebody prepare a list of topics and points
to be covered in this video?

A: As far as camera shots and where various evidence items were located,
yes.

Q: Wasn't there another list of topics: Substantive points to be
covered?

A: Now you're talking about what Bob and I discussed, and I understand
that's attorney privileged.

Q: You and he had such a discussion, but nobody else participated. Is
that your testimony?

A: Yes.

Q: Wasn't the idea--You did not know what Becker was going to ask you.
Correct?

A: Correct.

Q: And wasn't the idea that after Becker asked you and you answered all
of the questions, if there were other points that you wanted to cover,
they would be covered later on in the video. Correct?

A: Correct.

Q: So isn't it--wasn't there a list of the topics that everybody would
check off that Becker covered, and the ones he didn't cover, you would
then bring up after the Becker interview?

A: To an extent, yes. To an extent.

Q: Who prepared that list of topics?

A: Generally, the public.

Q: The public.

A: Yes.

Q: How did the public prepare that list?

A: I believe they went out with cameras and asked the man on the street
what you would want to ask O.J., and we looked at that and took the most
probative questions from that.

Q: The producer and his crew did that?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you participate in deciding which ones you wanted to cover and --

A: Not at all.

Q: Who did that?

A: I guess they did.

Q: So you had nothing to do at what point--you had no say in what points
would be covered and not covered on your video. Is that--

A: Not with them. Not with them, no.

Q: With who?

A: With my lawyer.

Q: Your lawyer, meaning Mr. Blasier?

A: Yes.

Q: Anyway, where are these lists of topics?

A: I have no idea.

Q: Where are the input that the public gave? The documents or the tapes,
whatever the public gave, where is that?

A: I have no idea.

Q: You have none of that?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Do you know a man by the name of Keith Smith?

A: No. I don't remember--

Q: Excuse me?

A: I wouldn't remember him. If I did know him, I don't know his name.
Like I don't know these guys' names.

Q: Which guys?

A: These guys.

Q: My partners?

A: Yeah.

Q: Okay. When is the video coming out?

A: I don't know.

Q: Did you participate in editing any part of the video?

A: I gave suggestions to portions that were not the interview.

Q: The interview we're referring to is the Ross Becker interview. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: That's one element of the video. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: There are essentially three components to the video?

A: I believe so, yes.

Q: What are the other two?

A: One is walking around looking at various, you know, stuff that came
up, you know, in the trial about where blood and gloves and things were
found, and one was just me talking to the camera.

Q: The one walking around looking at the various places where evidence
was located, that was you also talking to the camera?

A: Yes.

Q: And you said you participated in editing the two elements not
involving Becker. Is that right?

A: Not really. I just--I looked at it and--I just looked at it.

Q: Did you at any time during the making of this video indicate that you
did not want any particular footage to be included in the final cut?

A: No.

Q: Do you have any outtakes?

A: No.

Q: Do you know if there are any outtakes?

A: I don't know. I haven't seen the final product.

Q: Who has all this material? Is it Mr. Hoffman?

A: I don't know. Maybe the production company.

Q: What is the name of the company?

A: I really don't know.

Q: Was there any other lawyer involved in assisting you with this video
besides Mr. Blasier?

A: Not representing me, no.

Q: Was any part of what you said in the two elements of the video not
involving Mr. Becker written out in advance?

A: Pardon me?

Q: Focusing on the two elements of the video not involving Becker, where
you talked to the people and talked to the camera and walked around and
so forth, was that material written out for you?

A: No.

Q: Did you write it out?

A: Write it out?

Q: Yeah.

A: No.

Q: Did you make notes about what you wanted to say?

A: At what point?

Q: At any point.

A: The interview?

Q: No. Forget the interview. The other parts where you're talking to the
camera without Becker.

A: Yes.

Q: Where are those notes?

A: I don't know.

Q: You made them out in your own handwriting?

A: Yes.

Q: On index cards?

A: No.

Q: And also on your legs?

A: Uh-huh.

Q: Where?

Bobby Bender. Goes on and on.

Q: Can you identify them for me?

A: Allen Austin, Bob Hoskins, Al Wyler--

Q: Wyler?

A: Wyler. Cory Wolman. I know I forgot someone, but I would say among my
best friends, that would be pretty much the group.

Q: Was Kato Kaelin among your best friends--

A: No.

Q: --in June of 1994?

A: No.

Q: One of your close friends?

A: No.

Q: How would you characterize your relationship with him at that time?

Q: And she was not there on Saturday, June 11, 1994. Correct?

A: Yes.

Q: The last time that Gigi was at your house in this time frame in June
was Friday at the end of the day, June 9?

A: I believe so. I believe so. I don't recall seeing her Friday, but-

MR. BREWER: Mr. Petrocelli, could we ask the witness just to keep his
voice up?

THE WITNESS: I believe so, Friday, yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you know how she got--how she departed your
house on Friday, whether she had her own car or whether somebody in your
house drove her?

A: I know no one at my house drove her-- I can't answer that because I
don't know if Kato drove her, but I have no knowledge.

Q: Did she have her own car?

A: From time to time, yes.

Q: When she was at your house Monday through Friday, did she have a car
there?

A: From time to time. yes.

Q: Her own car?

October of this year?  A: Yes.

Q: Of last year. Excuse me.

A: Yes.

Q: You speak to her from time to time?

A: Yes.

Q: Has she done any work for you?

A: She's made me--yes.

Q: I mean since you--

A: Well, work, no, but she's--yeah, no, she hasn't done any work. I'm
sorry.

Q: What has she done for you?

A: Made me cookies.

Q: Cookies. But she hasn't been in your employ?

A: No.

Q: But she is a friend now?

A: Yeah. I like her. Yes.

Q: How long did she work for you?

A: On and off over a 10 year,12-year period.

Q: So starting in the '80s and going to March 1994?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you have any other housekeepers in 1993 or '94 other than
Michelle and Gigi?

A: Not that I recall.

Q: Any other house help?

A: I think Michelle got some help from time to time.

Q: Nobody you would know. Right?

A: No.

Q: Okay. By the way, would you consider Robert Kardashian one of your
close friends?

A: Oh, yes, I'm sorry. I certainly would.

Q: As of June of 1994?

A: Yes.

Q: How long had you known Mr. Kardashian as of June of 1994?

A: Over 20 years.

Q: Did he ever act as your attorney?

A: Yes.

Q: When?

A: On some business deals that we had done in the past.

MR. KELLY: I am sorry. I am not able to hear the witness' answers.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: They are having trouble hearing you, Mr. Simpson.

A: Some business deals that we had done in the past.

Q: In the '70s?

A: '70s and possibly '80s.

Q: But aside from those business deals, your relationship with him is
principally a friendship one. Right?

A: Principally, yes.

Q: Have you ever been convicted of a felony?

A: No.

Q: Have you ever been convicted of any crime?

A: I pleaded no contest in a spousal abuse case in 1989, so I don't know
what that is.

Q: Have you ever pleaded no contest or guilty or been found guilty to
any other crimes?

A: No.

Q: Have you ever been charged with any crimes other than the spousal
abuse and the murder case?

A: No.

Q: Have you ever been sued civilly for any acts of physical violence?

A: No.

Q: Have you ever been charged with rape?

A: No.

Q: I don't mean-- Formally in a complaint?

A: No.

Q: Nothing like that in your whole past?

A: No.

Q: Criminally?

A: No.

Q: Informally?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever make a settlement with anyone who charged you with
assault, rape or battery?

A: No.

Q: As of June of 1994, is it true that you had generally favorable
relations with the Los Angeles Police Department? MR. BAKER: I don't
know what you mean by that, and I don't know that he can characterize
his relations.  BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You can answer.

MR. BAKER: No, don't answer. That question is overbroad, vague and
ambiguous.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you think you had a good relationship with the
LAPD as of June 1,1994?

MR. BAKER: His state of mind relative to his relations with the LAPD,
it's irrelevant and I am going to instruct him not to answer that
question.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

Q: Before June 1 of 1994, had you ever been arrested by the LAPD?

A: No.

Q: Had they ever come out to your house?

A: Yes.

Q: When you were present?

A: In an official capacity?

Q: No. Had they ever--Yes, in an official capacity.

A: Yes.

Q: When you were present at the house?

A: Yes.

Q: On how many occasions?

A: One, possibly two times.

Q: What was the one time that you remember clearly?  A: 1989.

Q: They came out to your house and did not arrest you?

A: Correct.

Q: And the other time was when?

A: I don't totally remember this time, but it was 19- I think -84. They
tell me Mark Fuhrman came to my house.

Q: And he did not arrest you. Correct?

A: No.

Q: Nor did anyone else. Right?

A: No.

Q: And are there any other times that you can remember when the police
in their official capacity came out to your house?

A: No.

Q: Now, were there any times when you were at Nicole's house that the
police came out?

A: Once.

Q: When was that?

A: 1993.

Q: Did they arrest you then?

A: No.

Q: Did members of the LAPD frequent your house from time to time?

MR. BAKER: That's pretty vague and ambiguous, too.

THE WITNESS: Yeah, you'll have to be a little more specific because I
can't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did they ever come visit you?

A: Stop-

MR. BAKER: In an unofficial capacity come visit him for a social call,
is that the question?

MR. PETROCELLI: Correct, Mr. Baker, and all of this is before June 12,
1994.

THE WITNESS: Yes. And even after they've stopped and talked to me at my
driveway and stuff, yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Even now, you mean?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Prior to June 12, 1994, would they come to your house from time
to time to use your pool?

A: No.

Q: Your tennis courts?

A: One individual had used my pool I think when he was still with the
LAPD.

Q: Who was that?

A: Ron Shipp.

Q: Okay.

A: And never alone did he ever use my pool at that point, but my tennis
court, I'm pretty sure he did.

Q: He used your tennis court?

A: Yes.

Q: Any other LAPD members use your tennis court--

A: Not that I know of.

Q: --besides Mr. Shipp?

A: Not that I know of.

Q: Did Mr. Shipp bring other people with him when he used the pool and
tennis courts?

A: Tennis court we're talking, not pool. Yes, he had a--from time to
time he had a foursome that he would play tennis with.

Q: Did you ever file any charge of harassment against the police at any
time before June of 1994?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Did you ever attend any LAPD Christmas parties?

A: Not that I recall.

Q: Did you ever attend any LAPD functions?

A: Not that I recall.

Q: You don't remember attending annual Christmas parties?

A: I know I didn't attend, not annually any, but I don't recall ever
doing that, no.

Q: Any kind of parties or functions?

A: Over my years in L.A. I've attended a lot of functions, and I can't
really recall any that were specifically LAPD.

Q: Did you ever autograph footballs for officers?

A: Oh, yes.

Q: LAPD officers?

A: Every officer, everybody, yes.

Q: Did you charge them?

A: I never charge.

Q: And did not charge the LAPD. Correct?

A: Well, I don't know. If an LAPD officer drove up and had a football
and asked me to sign it, I'm sure I didn't charge him.

Q: And you signed other things for them, too, besides footballs?

A: I've signed pictures for everybody, LAPD or whatever they might be.

Q: Your son Jason was given an LAPD cap from a police officer?

A: I would assume so. I have not saw the cap.

Q: Do you know who gave it to him?

A: Probably Ron Shipp. I don't know.

Q: You just don't know?

A: I'm guessing. I don't know.

Q: What reasons would the LAPD come visit you in their unofficial
capacity?

MR. BAKER: Don't answer that question. That calls for speculation on the
part of this witness.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What did you understand the purpose of the visits
to do?

MR. BAKER: If they told you what they--the reason they came, you can
relate that. Don't speculate.

MR. PETROCELLI: He doesn't have to be told.

MR. BAKER: Don't guess or speculate.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You can answer.

A: They dropped by, they look, they talk, and sometimes they'd ask for
an autograph. Since the trial, on two occasions they came by to tell me
I got screwed.

Q: Now, before the trial when they would stop by and talk, how would
they get to the front door?

A: They wouldn't. Normally -- I don't ever recall them knocking on my
front door. I mean, maybe Shipp has before. But normally, if they see me
in my yard --I spend a lot of time in my yard, and I didn't keep my
gates locked up previously.

Q: And they would see you, and you would converse and chat, just social
talk. Right?

A: Yeah.

Q: Pleasantries. Right?

A: Uh-huh.

Q: So your dealings with the LAPD were cordial?

A: Yeah. For the most part, yes.

Q: Do you know any other--before June of 1994,did you know any other
police officers by name other than Ron Shipp?

A: Yes. Years ago, and I can't think of his name now, when I was at USC
there was a guy who worked for LAPD, nice guy, but I think he stopped
working for the LAPD back then also. He was in a shoot-out and stopped
working.

Q: Which officers came by and said you got screwed?

A: I don't know. I don't know the ones that came by and asked for an
autograph either.

Q: The ones that came by and said you got screwed, you don't know who
they are?

A: No. They were just outside of my house, and my security was around.

Q: Did they explain to you how you got screwed?

A: No. They just said--one guy on a motorcycle drove up to me once and
said it also.

Q: Did he explain what he meant?

A: No. He drove off. Gave me the thumb's up--said, "They tried to screw
you," gave me the thumbs up and left.

Q: "They" being whom?

MR. BAKER: If you had an impression.

THE WITNESS: I'm assuming the prosecution.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did anybody ever say to you--these officers who
drove by and spoke to you since you got out of jail ever say to you that
the LAPD tried to screw you?

A: No

Q: Okay. Do you believe you were framed by the LAPD?

MR. BAKER: You don't answer that question.

MR. PETROCELLI: Why not?

MR. BAKER: Because that's argumentative. It's irrelevant, immaterial
what his state of mind is.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you have any information that you were framed
by the LAPD?

MR. BAKER: He is not going to answer that. You are not going to try this
case through him. You are going to try it through evidence.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am trying to find out his state of mind.

MR. BAKER: His state of mind is irrelevant

MR. PETROCELLI: I am not asking for his state of mind. I am asking for
what information he has, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: No, you are not. You are not going to answer that question.

MR. PETROCELLI: Give me an objection so we can just have a clean record.

MR. BAKER: I did give you an objection, and I gave you an instruction.
It's irrelevant, immaterial, and it calls for his state of mind, and
it's argumentative.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: When did you first think you were being framed by
the LAPD?

MR. BAKER: Don't answer that question. We are not going to go through a
deposition of his state of mind.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you contend that you were framed by the LAPD?

MR. BAKER: I will do the contentions, and he is not going to answer that
question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: As of June 17, Mr. Simpson, did you have any
information that caused you to believe that you were being framed or set
up by the LAPD?

A: No.

Q: Let's talk a little bit about June 17th. You were present at the home
of Mr. Kardashian on the morning of June 17th?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. And you were there in the morning. Right?

A: Uh-huh.

Q: You have to answer yes.

A: Yes.

Q: And who was present with you? Who was in the house?

A: Paula Barbieri. At one point A.C. came.

Q: A.C. Cowlings?

A: Yes, Al Cowlings. At one point Shapiro and, of course, Kardashian. I
believe Kardashian's girlfriend--

Q: What's her name?

A: Denise Halicki. I believe Nicole Pulvers, and then some doctors. I'm
not sure. I'm pretty sure Dr. Lee was there. Dr. Huizenga I believe was
there. I believe Mike Baden. I'm saying this only because I've heard
these guys talk since then, so I believe that he was there.

Q: Who?

A: Mike Baden. Michael Baden. That's all I can recall right now.

Q: Bob Shapiro was, of course, your lawyer in the criminal case.

A: Yeah, he came there. I know he came.

Q: And Cowlings and Kardashian were your very close friends. Right?

A: Yeah, they have been my friends for years.

Q: And Paula Barbieri was -- she was your girlfriend?

A: Yeah, basically, yes.

Q: And Denise Halicki was Mr. Kardashian's girlfriend. Right?

A: Yes.  Q: Nicole Pulvers was whom?

A: She was assisting Bob Kardashian.

Q: And these doctors, Lee, Huizenga and Baden, they were all retained in
connection with your criminal case? A: Yes.

Q: Was Huizenga a preexisting doctor of yours?

A: No. I'd only--he had only done something for me on one other occasion
previous to this.

Q: When was that?

A: I was on a plane coming back with the Raiders once and I was having
some major eye problems, and he sort of helped me out.

Q: Was that when he was the Raider team physician?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay.

A: Oh, and previous to that day, that week he had done a physical on me
and stuff.

Q: The week of June 13.

A: Yes.

Q: Correct?

A: Yes.

Q: He did that on June 15. Correct?

A: I believe so.

Q: Okay. Now, you understood that you were going to be arrested.

A: Yes.

Q: And the arrangements were that you were going to be taken down to
LAPD?

A: I believe so. I believe I was gonna -- they were gonna drive me down.
Mike, you know, Shapiro. I believe that was the arrangement.

Q: Shapiro was going to drive you to the police station?

A: Yes.

Q: And what time were you scheduled to go to the police station?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Were you on any medication?

A: Yes.

Q: At that time?

A: Yes.

Q: In the morning?

A: Yes.

Q: What were you on?

A: I have no idea.

Q: Who gave it to you?

A: I think Dr. Faerstein-

Q: He was there also?

A: I don't recall if he was there. I know he--I think he was the one who
prescribed the medication

Q: What did he prescribe?

A: I don't know. You'd have to ask him

Q: Did he give the pills to someone else to administer to you?

A: I don't know. I know that when I needed them, Cathy or Paula would
get them, and early when he was around, he'd give them to me.

Q: Cathy Randa was there also?

A: I believe she came there that day. I'm not a hundred percent sure.

Q: Before you left?

A: Yes.

Q: By the way, are you on any drugs or medication now?

A: Yes.

Q: What are you taking?

A: Sulfasalazine and prescription Motrin.

Q: Motrin?

A: Yeah.

Q: For what?

A: Pain.

Q: What kind of pain?

A: Just arthritic, whatever, general arthritic pains.

Q: And what is the other medication?

A: It's called Sulfasalazine. It's something that a rheumatologist has
had me on for a few years now.

Q: Going back to when?

A: '93 sometime.

Q: Are you taking anything else right now?

A: No.

Q: Do those medications in any way interfere with your ability to hear,
understand and answer truthfully my questions?

A: Not that I know of.

Q: Okay. So going back to the morning of the 17th, do you remember what
time you were scheduled to depart for LAPD?

A: No.

Q: What did you do on the morning of the 17th at the house?

A: I think they were taking pictures of me.

I know I wrote, I did some writing. That's pretty much all I recall.

Q: They took pictures of you, meaning parts of your anatomy?

A: I believe that was that morning. I'm not a hundred percent sure, but
I believe-

Q: The doctors did?

A: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was that morning.

Q: Did you receive any injections?

A: Not that I recall.

Q: Did they take any blood?

A: I don't recall.

Q: What kind of writing did you do?

A: Some writing, putting some of my thoughts down, thoughts that I had
for friends and things.

Q: Did you write individual letters to different people?

A: Just a basic letter. 

Q: One basic letter?

A: I may have written two basic letters.  Q: The one basic letter, is
that the letter that was later on that day read by Bob Kardashian?

A: I believe so.

Q: You wrote that?

A: Yes.

Q: In your own handwriting?

A: Yes.

Q: And you wrote it the morning of the 17th?

A: Yes.

Q: Did anybody assist you in writing it?

A: No.

Q: You wrote it all yourself?

A: Yes.

Q: Did anybody dictate anything to you?

A: No.

Q: Did anybody tell you what to say?

A: No.

Q: Did anybody suggest what to say?

A: No.

Q: Anybody review it after you finished it?

A: No

Q: What did you do with it when you finished writing It?

A: I don't know immediately when I finished writing it, but I may have
given it to Bob.

MR. BREWER: Sorry. I can't hear you.

THE WITNESS: I don't know what I did immediately when I finished writing
it. I either gave it to Bob to hold or to A.C. I don't recall what I
did.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you put it in an envelope?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you seal the envelope?

A: Yes.

Q: How did you address the envelope?

A: I don't know if I addressed it to anyone. I'm not sure.

Q: When you handed it to Bob--is that what you said?

A: Yeah.

Q: What-

MR. BAKER: He said Bob or Al, I believe.

MR. PETROCELLI: Bob or Al?

Q: What did you say it was?

A: I just told them to keep this.

Q: What did you tell them to do with it?

A: Just keep it.

Q: Did you tell them to open it?

A: No.

Q: To read it?

A: No.

Q: Did you tell him that you'll know when it's appropriate to open and
read this?

A: No

Q: Did you say that?  A: No.

Q: What was your purpose in giving it to them?

A: It was just some thoughts I wanted to share with some people.

Q: When did you understand that the thoughts would be shared?

MR. BAKER: If you had an understanding.

THE W1TNESS: If I had an understanding. I don't know. I was, you know, I
was in a--I don't know. My frame of mind, I can only speak to you based
on how I feel now about it, and I thought that if I had harmed myself in
any way, that they would read it to my friends.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Such as if you killed yourself?

A: Yes.

Q: You were suicidal that week. Right?

A: Evidently, yes.

Q: And you were on suicide watch?

A: I don't know about that week. I don't know. You say "suicide watch."
I wasn't aware that I was suicidal, so I don't know.

Q: When you wrote that letter, though, you had thoughts of suicide.
Right?

A: I had a thought--thoughts of-yeah, I had thoughts of ending what I
was feeling, yes.

Q: Certain persons were keeping vigil over you to see that you wouldn't
harm yourself. Is that right?

A: I really wasn't aware of that at the time, no.

Q: Your sister?

A: I wasn't aware of that so much at the time. I knew that they were
with me for support. I knew my sister was. I only spent one night at
Rockingham, and I knew she was there for support with me.

Q: The one night you spent at Rockingham was the 13th, a Monday night.
Right?

A: Yes.

Q: You summoned Paula Barbieri back from Las Vegas to be with you and to
keep vigil over you. Is that right?

A: That's not correct, no.

Q: Did you ask her to come back?

A: No.

Q: Who did?

A: I don't know. I think she insisted on coming back.

Q: On her own?

A: Pretty much so.

Q: How do you know that?

A: Because she came back.

Q: How do you know she insisted on coming back on her own?

A: I don't know. I just-

Q: You don't know if anybody called her and asked her to come back?

A: I don't know. I know I wanted her there, but at the same time I
didn't want her there because of all the press that was hanging around,
so I did -- I was glad she came.

Q: Did you ask anybody to call her?

A: I don't recall doing that, no.

Q: Did you ask Cathy to do that?

A: I don't recall doing that, no.

Q: What was the other basic--Let me get back to this letter. When you
wrote this letter, were you alone?

A: Yes.

Q: And where were you?

A: I was sitting in my room. I guess I was sitting in the room.

Q: Bedroom?

A: I think I had written it in a few places. I was just taking notes
when I was not being bothered.

Q: You wrote it in one sitting?

A: I don't think so. I'm not sure. I don't think so.

Q: Did you write it all on the morning of the 17th of June?

A: Yes.

Q: You said you had thoughts of ending what you were feeling. What were
you feeling?

A: A lot of pain.

Q: What kind of pain?

A: Pain.

Q: Pain over what?

A: My wife had been murdered, and I was being attacked.

Q: By whom.

A: Media.

Q: They were attacking you?

A: Yes.

Q: Meaning they were blaming you?

A: No. They were attacking me during the week, saying things that
weren't true.

Q: You felt the media were saying things, attacking you, that were not
true?

A: I knew they were. I saw it on TV.

Q: What were they saying about you?

A: Just various things.

Q: Well, can you tell us back then what you were thinking that was being
said about you that was untrue?

A: Just how I was reacting. One guy, I think Jim Avila, did a report
that I was in Chicago, and when I arrived there I was loud and
boisterous as if I was trying to be noticed, which was a flat-out lie,
and I'm sure you talked to the people in Chicago when I arrived, and
they made that clear, that I was anything but loud and boisterous. But
things of that nature. I can't recall them all.

Q: Were you feeling you were being attacked in the sense that you
believed the press was pointing  the finger at you as the person who
killed Nicole?

A: I can't say the press in general. Just a few things that I had heard,
because I stopped watching it after a while.

Q: But the gist of it was that these few things were pointing the finger
at you. Right?

A: My pain was for Nicole more than what they were doing. That was just
all a part of it.

Q: The loss of Nicole?

A: Yes.

Q: You loved her?

A: Very much.

Q: And you loved her on June 12?

A: I loved her. Yeah. I didn't want to live with her, but I loved her,
yes.

Q: And you loved her so much that you were prepared to kill yourself?

MR. BAKER: Well, that's argumentative. Don't answer.

THE WITNESS: That's not why.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You loved her so much that you were feeling so
much pain that you had thoughts of ending your life?

A: I just had pain for a lot of reasons, for everything that was going
on that week, yes.

Q: Well, besides the loss of Nicole and your feeling of being attacked,
was there any other source of your pain?

A: Just everything that was going on was my source of my pain.

Q: What do you mean by that, "everything that was going on"?

A: Everything that was going on.

Q: Can you be more specific?

A: No.

Q: Do you mean in the sense that people were blaming you?

A: No. I just mean everything that vas going on, and I can't be more
specific.

Q: You cannot tell us anything more than that?

A: No.

Q: What was the other note that you wrote?

A: It wasn't a note. It was an amendment to my will.

Q: Who did you give that to?

A: I believe I directed it to be given to Skip Taft.

Q: Did you write it in your hand?

A: Yes.

Q: What did you change?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Did someone tell you to change your will?

A: No.

Q: Was it your own idea?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you write it on a blank piece of paper?

A: I believe so.

Q: And who did you give that--How many pages was it?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Who did you give it to?

A: I believe whoever I gave the other letter to.

Q: What did you tell that person about the second envelope?

A: I think I put Skip Taft's name on it.

Q: Was it in an envelope?

A: I believe so, yes.

Q: Did you write any other notes, letters, that morning?

A: Not that I recall.

Q: What about that week prior to the 17th, did you write any other notes
or letters for people?

A: No.

Q: Were your children there with you?

A: No.

Q: Were your children with you at all during the week of the 13th?

A: Yes.

Q: What days?

A: They came on the 14th and left on the 15th.

Q: Came to?

A: Bob Kardashian's home.

Q: And they stayed over?

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry. I can't hear you again, Mr. Simpson. I'm sorry.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. Bob Kardashian's home.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: The 14th was a Tuesday. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Your children came to your house on Tuesday, and they left on
Wednesday. Is that what you're saying?

A: That's correct.

Q: They slept over at Mr. Kardashian's house?

A: Yes.

Q: By "your children," are we talking about Sydney and Justin?

A: Yes.

Q: Who brought them both ways?

A: Al Cowlings.

Q: And they were at the Brown residence in Dana Point?

A: That's correct.

Q. So Mr. Cowlings was with them in Dana Point, brought them to the
Kardashian house and brought them back to Dana Point on Wednesday?

A: That's correct.

Q: Did he bring anyone else with him other than Sydney and Justin?

A: I don't believe so, no.

Q: The last time you saw your kids before you were arrested was
Wednesday?

A: No.

Q: You saw them at the funeral?

A: Yes.

Q: I see. That was Thursday. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Did you write any notes or letters out to your children that
week?

A: No.

Q: Did you write any checks that day?

A: No.

Q: Did you give Mr. Cowlings any envelopes with anything in them? 

A: I don't think so, other than if he was the guy I gave the letter to.

Q: Did you give Mr. Cowlings a sealed envelope with six checks in it?

A: No.

Q: Do you know whether Mr. Cowlings had a sealed envelope with six
checks in it-

A: No.

Q: --on the 17th of June?

A: No.

Q: You have no knowledge about that?

A: No.

Q: After you did some basic writing, they took some pictures of you,
what else did you do that morning?

A: Nothing else I can recall.

Q: Did you say good-bye to anybody?

A: No.

Q: You were anticipating going off to jail. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And would not know when you would return. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Now, you did not wait for the police, but left. Right?

A: Correct.

Q: And you left with whom?

A: Al Cowlings.

Q: What time did you leave?

A: I have no idea.

Q: When you left with Mr. Cowlings, you left the Kardashian residence in
Mr. Cowlings' Bronco. Correct?

A: Correct.

Q: Parked in the driveway. Right?

A: Correct.

Q: Did you tell anyone that you were going?

A: No.

Q: Did they--to your knowledge did they know that you were going?

A: No.

MR. BAKER: That calls for speculation.

THE WITNESS: Not to my knowledge, no.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Why didn't you tell them you were going?

A: I didn't think about them.

Q: You knew the police were coming, though. Right.

A: Yes.

Q: And you knew that if you had left, you would not be there when they
arrived. Right?

A: I didn't know they were coming. I knew that I was supposed to be
going down there.

Q: Supposed to be going to the police station.

A: Yes.

Q: And you knew by leaving the residence, you wouldn't be going to the
police station then. Right?

MR. BAKER: Well, I don't know-

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You can answer.

MR. BAKER: That's argumentative, but go ahead.

THE WITNESS: What was the question? I'm sorry.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you please repeat it?

(Pending question read as follows:

"Q: And you knew by leaving the residence, you wouldn't be going to the
police station then. Right?")

THE W1TNESS: Correct.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: In other words, you didn't ask Mr. Cowlings to
take you to the police station. Right?

A: Correct.

Q: Whose idea was it to leave?

A: Mine.

Q: Why did you leave?

A: Because I wanted to go to Nicole's grave.

Q: Did you ask your lawyers if you could go there first?

A: No.

Q: Your representatives?

A: No.

Q: Did you ask them to ask the police if you could go there first?

A: No.

Q: You just took it on yourself to leave?

A: Yes.

Q: Why did you do that?

A: Because I wanted to go to her grave.

Q: And did you go to her grave?

A: Yes. Well, we never made it there because there was a police car
blocking the entrance.

Q: They wouldn't let you in?

A: Well, A.C. saw them and avoided going in. 
Q: Do you know what time you left the house?

A: No.

Q: Do you know--when you left the Kardashian house and you got in the
truck, where were you sitting?

A: In the passenger seat.

Q: Visible to anybody who would look in?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you remain in the passenger seat all the way down to the
grave site?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you make any phone calls from the car?

A: I believe so.

Q: Who did you call?

A: I don't remember totally, but I know I called Nicole's house, and
then I know I called some other people, but I don't recall who.

Q: When you say "Nicole's house," do you mean the condo on--the place on
Bundy?

A: Yes.

Q: Who did you speak to there?

A: Lou Brown.

Q: He was staying there?

A: Yeah. I guess so. 
Q: What did you tell Mr. Brown?
A: I don't recall.

Q: Did you call anybody else?

A: I know l did, but I don't recall who.

Q: Did you call Mr. Taft?

A: I may have, yes. Q: Why did you call Mr. Taft?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Did you drive directly to the grave site?

A: Yes.

Q: How long did it take to get there?

A: I don't know. 

Q: Did you make any stops?

A: Well, I think there was a--I've just heard this from A.C.--that there
was a dump truck that had turned over, so we sat on the freeway for
quite a while.

Q: Which freeway?

A: I believe it was the 405.

Q: For how long did you sit there?

A: I don't know.

Q: Half hour?

A: I can't say. I really don't know.

Q: And the whole time you were in the passenger seat

A: Yes.

Q: And when you got--did you get to the entrance of the cemetery?

A: Where we could see the entrance, yes. 

Q: What is the name of the cemetery?

A: I don't know.

Q: How close did you get to the entrance?

A: I don't know. Couple hundred yards maybe.

Q: And why did you not go through?

A: Because there was a police car blocking it.

Q: Were-- did you approach the officer and ask if you could go through?

A: No.

Q: Were you listening to the radio at all?

A: No.

Q: Did you believe at that time that you were a fugitive?

A: I didn't give it a thought.

Q: Did Mr. Cowlings tell you that?

A: No.

Q: Did you believe that the police were looking for you?

A: I really didn't give it a thought, but --

MR. BAKER: You've answered the question. 

THE WITNESS: No, I really didn't give it a thought.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you believe if you went up to the officer and
asked to be let through, that he would have prevented you from doing so?

MR. BAKER: He is asking for your state of mind on the 17th of June,
1994, if you thought the officer would have prevented you from going
into the cemetery.

THE WITNESS: Probably.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Why did you have that belief?

A: I don't know. I just--I think A.C. believed that, and I'm pretty sure
I believed that, too.

Q: When you asked Mr. Cowlings to take you to the cemetery, what did he
say?

A: "Come on."

Q: Did he try to talk you out of it?

A: Not at all.

Q: He understood that you were supposed to go to the police station to
be turned in. Right? A: You'd have to ask him that.

Q: Did you believe he understood that?

A: I believe that he probably knew that, yes.

Q: Did you and he discuss what you would do after you left the cemetery?

A: No.

Q: Did you have a plan at that time?

A: No.

Q: Did you know what you were going to do after you left the cemetery?

A: No. No.

Q: Did you bring anything with you?

A: Yes.

Q: What did you bring?

A: That I was aware of, three pictures of my family and a gun.

MR. BREWER: What was the second thing?

THE WITNESS: A gun.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you plan to commit suicide at the cemetery?

A: I didn't know what I was going to do.

Q: Did you plan to commit suicide after the cemetery?

A: I never thought of it to that extent.

Q: Did you have in your mind when you would end your life?

A: No. I just--no.

Q: Was the purpose of the gun to use to end your life if you saw fit to
do so?

A: I'm sure that was part of it, yes.

Q: Where did you get the gun?

A: From my--actually, from my car.

Q: Which car?

A: My Bentley.

Q: The Bentley was at Rockingham. Right?

A: Uh-huh.

Q: You have to answer-

A: Yes.

Q: And how did the Bentley get from Rockingham to Mr. Kardashian's home?

A: It didn't.

Q: You stopped off at Rockingham and picked up the gun?

A: No.

Q: Explain to me how you got the gun.

A: I was curious when I got home from the police station, because I told
the police that the gun was in my Bronco, and at that point no one had
told me how Nicole was murdered, and I was curious if the gun was still
in my car, and at one point-I don't know who--I asked some body to go
look in my back seat and get a little case. They got it, and it was the
gun.

Q: When you said that you told the police the gun was in your Bronco,
you're referring to the statement you --

A: The Bentley.

Q: I am sorry. When you told the police--your prior answer was that you
told the police that the gun was in your Bronco.

A: I meant Bentley.

Q: You meant Bentley?

A: Yes.

Q: When you said that you told the police that the gun was in your
Bentley, are you referring to the statement that you gave to Detectives
Vannatter and Lange?

A: Yes.

Q: And when you left the police department, you went back to Rockingham,
and you had someone go into the Bentley to see if the gun was still
there?

A: Eventually. Not quite the way you said it, but eventually.

Q: That day?

A: Yeah, later that day, yes. 

Q: Who went into the Bentley for you?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Who did you ask to get the gun?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Did the person bring it to you?

A: Not the gun. They brought the case that it was in to me.

Q: A gun case?

A: No.

Q: What case are you referring to?

A: It's just a little case that it used to be carried in.

Q: Leather bag? What was it?

A: It was like a little violin case.

Q: A violin case?

A: Like a miniature violin case.

Q: A hard case?

A: Yes.

Q: And what did that case have in it?

A: A gun.

Q: What else?

A: That's it.

Q: Bullets?

A: I'm sure bullets, yes.

Q: In the gun?

A: Yes.

Q: Now...

MR. BAKER: Is this a good time? Let's take a break. We've been going for
an hour and 20, 15 minutes.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:51.

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 11:09.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: I want to go back to where we were, Mr. Simpson,
concerning the retrieval of the gun. Do you remember what time you got
back to Rockingham from the police station on the 13th of June?

A: From my office because they wouldn't let us go directly back to
Rockingham. If I had to guess--it's a guess--roughly 6:00 o'clock maybe.

Q: You went from the police station to your office in Brentwood?

A: Yes.

Q: And then you went to Rockingham.

A: They told us it was all right to come back.

Q: Come back. Can you guys hear down there?

Q: You just need to keep your voice up.

A: From the police station to Rockingham, and then I believe it was
Lange said it was all right, or Vannatter one, when I called my home, to
come home.

MR. BAKER: You just said you went from the police station to Rockingham.
You went-

THE WITNESS: To my office in Brentwood and then to Rockingham.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Who drove you from the police station to the
office?

A: Either Bob or Bob Skip, Bob Kardashian or Weitzman.

Q: And from the office to Rockingham, who drove you?

A: I don't know. Probably Bob or Skip. I don't really recall.

Q: Bob being Bob Kardashian?

A: Yes.

Q: And Skip being Skip Taft?

A: Yes.

Q: When you got to Rockingham, you then asked someone to go look into
the Bentley for the gun because why?

A: May have been a little later.

Q: Later that evening?

A: Yeah. Because I was curious.

Q: What were you curious about?

A: If they took the gun out of my car.

Q: "They" being whom?

A: The police officers.

Q: Why did you want to know that?

A: I was just curious. Some people were murdered, and I had a gun in my
car.

Q: Now, was it your suggestion to get the gun?

A: I asked someone to go look and see, to bring me--if there was a case
in the back of my car, would they bring it to me.

Q: In the trunk?

A: No. In the back seat behind the front seat.

Q; Is that where you kept it?

A: Yes. Q: Who retrieved it for you?

A: I don't recall. Q: No idea?

A: No. Q: What was in the trunk of that Bentley?

MR. BAKER: And you are talking again on the 13th?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

THE WITNESS: I couldn't tell you exactly, but I know some gloves and
clubs and some balls were in there and some other paraphernalia. BY MR.
PETROCELLI:

Q: On the evening of June 12 and on to the day of June 13, you knew that
there were some clubs and some balls and other paraphernalia in the
trunk of the Bentley. Is that right?

A: I would assume they were still there on the 13th, yes.

Q: You last left the trunk--clubs and balls and other paraphernalia in
the trunk?

A: The last time I looked in my trunk, some balls were left in and some
I took out, and there was a bunch of junk back there, but a lot of
clubs, yes.

Q: Lots of clubs.

A: Yes.

Q: Golf clubs.

A: Yes.

Q: What was the last time you looked in the 

Bentley before June 13?

MR. BAKER: And you are referring to the trunk?

MR. PETROCELLI: Trunk of the Bentley.

THE WITNESS: Sunday night, the night--previous night.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: What time?

A: l0:00, a little after 10:00, a little before, in that area.

Q: P.M?

A: P.M., yeah.

Q: Okay. Let's go back now. When-at the point in time on the evening of
the 13th that you had someone go into the Bentley to get the gun, did
you not know how Nicole had been killed?

A: Yes.

Q: You did not know. Right?

A: I did not know.

Q: Did you believe that she had been killed by a gun?

A: I didn't know.

Q: Did you believe that that was even a possibility?

A: Obviously, yes.

Q: Did you have any information that she had been killed through the use
of a knife?

A: Not at all.

Q: Did you ask anyone how she was killed?

A: I asked the police on many occasions what happened, and they
continued to tell me that they didn't know and they were still
investigating.

Q: Did you see press reports and television programs during the day
about this?

A: Once I got home- 

MR. BAKER: "The day" is the 13th?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

Q: Before you went and asked that the gun be retrieved.

A: I knew that when I got home, we put on all three TVs, just about
every TV in the house was on, and, you know, the press didn't seem to
know much more than anyone else at that time.

Q: There were no reports that she had been killed perhaps by a knife?

A: None that I had seen, no.

Q: So you had no information whatsoever how she had been killed. Is that
right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Were you told that she had been murdered?

A: Yes. Basically, yes.

Q: And that's all you knew.

A: Yes.

Q: As of the evening of June 13. Correct?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you ask anyone else besides the police how she had been killed?
Bob Kardashian, Skip Taft, anyone else?

A: I may have during the course of the day as I came in contact with
people. I think everybody was trying to ask everybody what happened,
what did they know.

Q: And nobody had any knowledge about how she was killed as of that
point in time.

A: No.

Q: Correct

A: As far as I recall, no.

Q: What did you do with the gun case when you got it? Did you open it
up?

A: Yes.

Q: And what did you do?

A: I opened it up in my office. I believe I put it in my bag.

Q: Your office at the home?

A: Yes.

Q: Who was with you? 
A: I don't recall.

Q: What bag did you put it in?

A: I think no one was with me. When they gave me the case, I went in my
office and put it in my bag.

Q: "They" being whom? 

A: Whoever brought it in there.

Q: What bag?

A: My black bag that it was eventually found in.

Q: Can you describe that bag?

A: A black bag with zippers. And you guys have it, or the police
department have it. I thought they turned it over to you guys.

Q: So was the gun loaded in the case?

A: Yes.

Q: You took the gun, closed the case, and then you put the case into the
black bag? 

A: I believe so.

Q: And was there anything else in the black bag at that time?

A: Yes.

Q: What was in it?

A: Everything I had taken to Chicago.

Q: What did that include? Withdrawn. Tell me as best as you can recall
now what was in that bag on the 13th in your office when you put the gun
in it.

A: My overnight kit, a book- Q: What book?

A: I believe it was "Inca Gold." Inca Gold," I believe it was. Some
travel stuff.

Q: What do you mean by that?

A: You know, travel folder, that type of stuff.

Q: You mean tickets and stuff?

A: Yeah, tickets, travel, you know, schedule.

Q: What else?

A: What you guys now refer to as a disguise-

Q: When you say "you guys," what do you mean by that?

A: Well, I seen some people in this room refer to it on the news and the
press and the prosecution.

Q: Okay. So what do you refer to it as?

A: It was a beard and a goatee.

Q: So you had a beard and a goatee in that bag. A: Yeah. I never really
opened the package to see what, but it was like a Vandyke thing, I
believe. I never really looked at it, so I don't know.

Q: It was in a sealed package?

A: Yes.

Q: It had never been opened?

A: I had never opened it, no.

Q: As of the evening of the 13th when it was in your bag, it had not
been opened. Correct?

A: I had never opened it, no.

Q: Was it opened? You can't tell if it had been opened?

A: I don't know what Vannatter did, because he took my bag and- Q: That
was latter.

A: I don't know. No, I'm only basing it on his testimony.

Q: I am a little confused. Vannatter didn't have your bag as of the
evening of the 13th, did he?

A: Well, he perjured himself on the stand and testified that I told him
he can look in my bag, which I didn't, but I would have if he would have
asked, and he testified that he did look in my bag that Monday. Q: When
you were interviewed?

A: Yes.

Q: At the police station?

A: When I left the police station, he kept--my bag was in the trunk of
his car, and we're asking about picking it up, and he didn't want to
walk to the --go downstairs to get it and asked if it would be all right
if he took it to my house--gave it to me when he got back to my house.
So I was there with two--three lawyers and said "Sure."

Q: Well, I will get back to that, but let me see if I understand the
contents of the bag on the evening of the 13th. You mentioned the book,
the overnight kit, the travel materials and the beard and goatee.

A: Yeah. And who knows what else. I mean, there's a lot of-

Q: Can you remember anything else?

A: Change, credit cards, passports, whatever, what I keep in the bag all
the time. It's all in there that Monday.

Q: Your passport was in the bag?

A: Yes.

Q: You said 'passports." Do you have more than one? A: Well--no.
Sometimes I have my kids'.

Q: Your passport was in this black bag you're describing?

A: Yes.

Q: And when did you put the passport in that black bag?

A: It's always in the black bag.

Q: Always.

A: Always.

Q: And when did you put the beard and goatee in the bag?

A: Whenever I got it.

Q: When did you get it?

A: I don't know. A few weeks before that.

Q: Where did you get it?

A: Someone ordered it for me, and then it came to my office, and then I
got it.

Q: Who ordered it for you?

A: I asked a guy to get it for me, and I think he arranged it through
Cathy.

Q: Who did you ask?

A: Whoever the makeup guy was on the--actually, I asked a girl who had a
bunch of them on the shoot that I was doing for Playboy. She had a bunch
of mustaches and beards, and while they were 

doing my makeup, I said, "You know, I can use one of them," and I
explained why.

And she said she'd get one, and while I was working she evidently had
left, and then I had mentioned it to the other makeup person, and he
said he can get it, and he and Cathy spoke, and he got it.

Q: That day?

A: I don't know.

Q: This was the exercise video?

A: Yes.

Q: And this was done at your residence. Correct?

A: Mostly no. Mostly at a studio.

Q: When you had the conversation with the makeup artist, was it at the
studio?

A: Yes.

Q: What was that person's name?

A: I don't know.

Q: When you had the conversation with the second makeup artist, what was
that person's name?

A: I don't know.

Q: When did you receive the beard and goatee?

A: I believe a few days after that.

Q: At your home on Rockingham. 
A: No. At my office, I believe it was.

Q: In Brentwood?

A: Yes.

Q: And who gave it to you?

A: I think it was just sitting on my

desk. When I go to my desk in Brentwood, things are there, and Cathy
laid things out for me, I believe, and then I took it from the office
one day.

Q: Did you pay for it?

A: I'm sure Cathy paid for it, yes.

Q: Do you know how much it cost?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever see a receipt for it?

A: No.

Q: What was the reason that you explained to the makeup artists why you
wanted a beard and goatee?

A: Because I was going to Knotts Berry Farm. My kids had asked me to
take them to Knotts Berry Farm, and I get harassed--and I can't say
harassed, but people are after me all the time when I'm in those places.
so consequently I thought when I saw it there, it seemed like a good
idea.

Q: Have you ever used a disguise before in public places?

A: Just sorta. 
Q: What do you mean by that?

A: I've used--where I've had fake casts so I wouldn't have to sign
autographs, you know, sunglasses and hats and stuff in the past.

Q: Have you ever used a fake beard and goatee? 

A: I've used it before but not really for public, not really out in the
public.

Q: Not to disguise yourself from members of the public?

A: No. It's just if I'm doing a shoot sometime and they have them, I'll
come home, and I'll wear it home and tease my kids.

Q: Had you ever taken your kids to Knotts Berry Farm before?

A: Yes.

Q: Before June 1994?

A: Yes.

Q: And to Disney Land?

A: Yes.

Q: And other public places?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you ever wear a disguise to conceal your identity on those
occasions?

A: Sunglasses, fake casts on my hands, hats, yes.

Q: The fake cast on your hand wouldn't conceal your identity as OJ.
Simpson. Correct?

A: It keeps me from signing autographs. It's all for the same purpose.

Q: What I am trying to find out is whether you had ever worn a disguise
with your children in public places for the purpose of preventing people
from recognizing you.

A: As I say, when I wear sunglasses and hats that I wouldn't normally
wear. I've done that many times.

Q: And was that successful?

A: For the most part, yeah.

Q: Besides hats and sunglasses, had you ever worn any other disguises in
public for the purpose of concealing your identity?

A: Halloween. Other than that, no.

Q: Other than Halloween?

A: No.

Q: How did the beard and goatee get into your black bag from its
location on your desk in Brentwood?

A: I put it in there.

Q: That day? 
A: I would imagine so, yes.

Q: Now, from the time-

A: Not the day that I--whatever day I got it, I put it in my black bag.

Q: That's what I meant.

A: Yes.

Q: Now, from that day on, had you ever used it?

A: I don't believe it's ever been used.

Q: So you never used it. Right?

A: No.

Q: And you never opened it yourself. Right?

A: No.

Q: You looked at it, put it in the bag and left it there. Right?

A: Yeah.

Q: When did you--You said your

passport was always in your bag.

Correct?

A: Uh-huh. My travel bag, yes.

Q: This is the black leather bag we're talking about?

A: Yes.

Q: Let me show you some photographs from the trial. These are trial
exhibits. What they are--and correct myself: They are photographs of
trial 

1 exhibits. Okay?

A: Uh-huh.

MR. KELLY: Could I step up here and see these?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. I don't have duplicates of these, so everybody is
free to look at them.

MR. BAKER: Okay. Question?

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: The question, Mr. Simpson, is whether this black
bag that we've been talking about, this black leather bag where you had
the beard and goatee and the passport and credit cards and other items,
is identified in these exhibits.

A: Yeah, this appears to be the bag, yes.

Q: Could you point to it?

A:(Indicating.) It looks like that could be the bag- Q: So for the
record, you are pointing to what was marked in the trial as Exhibit
1064.

Are there other exhibit numbers there, Mr. Baker?

MR. BAKER: No. It's just 1064.

THE WITNESS: Two different bags, though.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Oh, there are two different bags on- MR. BAKER:
There is a carry-on bag in 1064 as 

well. It's a fold-over bag, garment bag I think it's commonly called. It
has his initials on it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: How many different bags are depicted in Exhibit
1064?

A: It appears to be two.

Q: The two on the right 
he bottom are a different bag. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: What bag is that?

A: Different than we're talking about. That's kind of a suit carry bag.

Q: And the other photographs, 1, 2, 3, 4, are the black garment bag?

A: No.

Q: The black leather bag?

A: Grip. Grip. I use it as a briefcase.

Q: What do you call this?

A: A grip, a briefcase. I use it as basically a briefcase, but I don't
carry a briefcase anymore, and it's a grip. It's a grip.

Q: Okay. And this is Exhibit 1064,the grip where-

MR. BAKER: Two-thirds of it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Two-thirds of it is the black bag that you had
with you on the evening of June 13th. Right?

A: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: By the way, Mr. Baker, Mr. Gelblum just informs me that
these two pictures here of the garment bags are 1065, Exhibit 1065, not
1064.

MR. BAKER: Okay. Are we going to mark anything? What are we going to do
relative to these exhibits?

MR. PETROCELLI: I wasn't planning on marking them again. I just wanted
to use it for identification.

MR. BAKER: Well, since he identified it, I want to mark it.

MR. PETROCELLI: These exhibits are immutable since we know what the
numbers are. If you have any suggestions, I have no objections, but I
don't have copies of this to mark, and I will be referring to a number
of trial exhibits, but maybe what we can do is later on make copies of
these. How's that?

MR. BAKER: All right. I don't have any objection to that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Do you have any suggestions?

MR. KELLY: Well, I was just thinking, at some 

point I think that should be marked. Even though we have a number
designating them with one copy in the book, I think it would be a good
idea if we have exhibit labels or something to mark them at this point
in the testimony. Especially since we have multiple bags on the same 

MR. BAKER: We can mark that as plaintiffs' 1 and get copies.

MR. PETROCELLI: Let me think about the logistics of that, but for now
let's just mark it Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1- 

MR. KELLY: Through 4.

MR. PETROCELLI: We already have plaintiff exhibit numbers for the
Barbieri deposition.

MR. LEONARD: Do you want to run sequentially, or do-

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't know if that's going to be possible.

MR. LEONARD: It's your deposition.

MR. PETROCELLI: What is your practice on that?

MR. BAKER: I usually run sequentially so we're not--so we don't have
Plaintiffs' 1 from- MR. PETROCELLI: I usually do also. MR. LEONARD:
Anybody know -anybody have a copy? 

MR. PETROCELLI: Do you have a copy from the Barbieri deposition? We will
get back to marking this.

MR. LEONARD: All right.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: When you went to the police station, did you bring
that black bag with you?

A: Yes. Q: And that black bag went to Chicago with you?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. And the first time that black bag left your possession when you
came back from Chicago is when?

A: When I believe it was Vannatter put it in the trunk of his car . Q:
Where?

A: At Rockingham.

Q: Before you went to the police station?

A: Yes.

Q: Then when you got to the police station, did you have it there?

A: No. It stayed in his car.

Q: And at some point later in the day Vannatter returned it to you? 


A: Yes.

Q: Okay. And that was when you got back from the office. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you look in the bag when he returned it to you?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you notice anything missing?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Did you notice anything added to it, anything new?

A: I didn't look that closely, but would say no.

Q: Okay. Why did you put the gun in the bag?

A: Because someone had--well, at the time it's because I just brought it
in the house, and my house was loaded with people, and I was in my
office and I just stuck it in the bag at that time.

Q: Were you the registered owner of that gun?

A: I thought I was, yes.

Q: Were you?

A: It turns out since, I have only read that it was registered to
someone else. 

Q: Who?

A: I don't know.

Q: How did you cause to get a gun registered in the name of another
person?

MR. BAKER: Well, wait a minute. That's argumentative. Don't answer that
question. That assumes that he caused that to happen.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you purchase that gun?

A: No.

Q: How did you come to possess the gun?

A: It was given to me as a gift.

Q: Who gave it to you as a gift?

A: I believe it was Mike Ornstein.

Q: Mike?

A: Ornstein.

Q: When did he give it to you?

A: One Christmas, I believe.

Q: Years before?

A: Possibly.

Q: And when you received the gun, did you do anything to try to get it
registered in your name?

A: I was told it was registered. It was already taken care of.

Q: By whom? 

A: I don't know. I didn't ask.

Q: So as of June of-

MR. BAKER: You mean who took care of the registration, or who told him
that it was registered?

MR. PETROCELLI: Who took care of the registration.

Q: Do you know who did?

A: I assume Mike Ornstein had.

Q: You don't know, though?

A: No.

Q: Who told you that it was taken care of?

A: Mike Ornstein.

Q: Had you ever used that gun?

A: No.

Q: Did you keep it loaded?

A: Yes.

Q: At all times?

A: From the time he gave it to me, no.

Q: When did you load it for the first time?

A: Roughly a month previous to the deaths.

Q: And why?

A: Because I had an incident on the freeway, and I started keeping the
gun in my car. 

Q: Before the incident on the freeway, you did not have the gun in your
car?

A: Correct.

Q: Where was it?

A: Probably in my closet.

Q: And this incident was around the 7th of May en route to Dana Point?

A: That's correct.

Q: Or Monarch Bay, I should say?

A: That's correct.

Q: Did you own any other guns in June of '94?

A: Yes.

Q: How many?

A: I don't know.

Q: Lots?

A: I would think so.

Q: Where were they?

A: Mostly in my closet. Q: More than five?

A: I don't think so.

Q: Were any of them loaded in June of '94 besides this one gun?

A: I don't believe so. One might have been, but it had a lock on it. 

Q: Can you identify the guns that you owned in June of '94?

A: No, I can't.

Q: Do you know the names of them?

A: One I know is an M---I think was an M-16,and I think that was the
.357, and I think there was another.

Q: Three guns?

A: I may have had some more, but I don't know. Q: Did you--beginning
around I think you said the month before the deaths, you put the .357
underneath the seat of the Bentley. Is that right?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you put any gun in the Bronco?

A: No

Q: You typically drove the Bronco. Right?

A: I drove both cars.

Q: You drove the Bronco more. A: You know, depends. It just depends. At
night I would drive the Bentley and--it just depends. You know, I really
can't tell you which one I drove more.

Q: You can't?

A: No. 

Q: The Bronco was your favorite car, wasn't it?

A: Not necessarily, no.

Q: You drove them both around the same. Correct? Is that what you're now
saying?

MR. BAKER: Is that what he is now saying as contrasted to what he said
before? That's argumentative. Instruct him not to answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Is that your testimony, that you drove both the
Bentley and the Bronco roughly the same?

A: Yeah, I would think actually roughly the same amount of time, yeah.

Q: Did you in June of 1994--let's make it more specific. As of June 12
of 1994, in addition to any guns that you had mentioned, did you own any
other weapons?

A: No.

Q: Did you own any knives other than kitchen 120] knifes?

A: Yes.

Q: How many?

A: I have no idea.

Q: Where did you get those knifes?

A: I worked for a company that made knifes.

Q: What is the name of that company?

A: Forschner.

Q: F-o-r-s-c-h-n-e-r. You are on the board of directors?

A: Yes.

Q: You were.

A: Yes.

Q: Are you still?

A: No.

Q: And what kind of knifes does Forschner make?

A: I was involved with the Swiss Army knife basically.

Q: What do you mean, you were "involved" with it?

A: Well, that's what I spent most of my time trying to promote.

Q: What is a Swiss Army knife?

A: A utility knife, I believe.

Q: How big is it?

A: It depends.

Q: There are different sizes?

A: Yes.

Q: What do they range from? 

A: A pocketknife to a multi-purpose larger

knife. Q: How long?

A: I don't know.

Q: What is the longest Swiss Army knife that you've seen?

MR. LEONARD: You talking about hilt and blade or blade? What are you
talking about?

MR. PETROCELLI: Blade.

THE WITNESS: I'm guessing now. I'd say the big knife is two, two and a
half, three inches maybe.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Have you ever seen one where the blade is six
inches?

A: No.

Q: Are the only knives that you owned outside of kitchen knives these
Swiss Army knives made by Forschner?

Q: I may have had a few other knives. I'm not sure.

Q: You may have?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you remember having any?

A: I remember one, but I remember having others, too.

Q: Well, how many did you have, outside of 

the Swiss Army knives, as of June 12?

A: I have no idea.

Q: More than 10?

A: I doubt that.

Q: More than five?

A: I don't know.

Q: Could it be more than five?

MR. BAKER: Don't guess or speculate.

THE WITNESS: I don't know.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Where were these knives?

A: I have no idea.

Q: What was their purpose in your having-- what was your purpose in
having them?

A: We went camping a lot, and, you know, from time to time you buy a
knife. So I hadn't seen them, but I bought a knife a few weeks before, a
month or so before.

Q: Who went camping a lot?

A: Nicole and I and the kids over the years, my other kids, Nicole and
I.

Q: And you used these knives for camping, the ones you're now referring
to?

A: Nicole would buy them and--I guess.

Q: Let me be clear on this, Mr. Simpson. I 

am asking what knives were in your house on the evening as of June 12,
1994 outside of knives used for eating. A: I have absolutely no idea.

Q: You described some Swiss Army knives. Correct?

A: Yes.

Q: Where were those kept?

A: Wherever. Downstairs in drawers. I give them out as gifts, so they're
all over the place.

Q: Were they in boxes?

A: Most of them, yes.

Q: Each individual Swiss Army knife was in a box. Correct?

A: Yes.

Q: And they were downstairs in various places?

A: Yes.

Q: Any in your bedroom?

A: I'm sure.

Q: You get them for free?

A: Yes.

1 Q: Did the Forschner Company Ever give you any training on the use of
these knives?

A: No.

Q: Now, in addition to the Swiss Army knives, you said that you owned
some other knives, the number of which you cannot recall. Right?

A: I said I assumed I did. Over the years I know with my older kids, my
younger kids, we have camped over the years and you buy things, and yes.

Q: Where did you keep the knives used for camping?

A: Normally outside with all whatever camping stuff we had, but I was
never in charge of that so I don't know.

Q: In the garage?

A: Yeah.

Q: Did you have any other knives in the residence, outside of the
garage?

A: I had one in particular that I do know of.

Q: Describe that knife.

A: It was sort of a jackknife, but it didn't have a spring.

Q: What do you mean by " jackknife"?

A: You know, when you used to push it and the knife jumps out.

Q: So when you pushed it, you have to pull it up, you mean? It didn't
spring out? 

A: Yeah. Well, I think you can even shake it out

Q: How long is that knife-

A: I don't know.

Q:--the blade?

A: I don't know.

Q: Where was that knife on the evening of June 12th?

A: In my--as far as I know, in my home.

Q: Where in your home?

A: In my bedroom.

Q: Was that a stiletto?

A: I don't know what -- I don't know.

Q: Where in your bedroom.

A: On a shelf.

Q: What shelf?

A: The shelf in my vanity.

Q: Can you describe exactly where in the vanity?

A: My vanity is one of these vanities with the mirrors, you can look
three ways, and it was on a shelf there.

Q: Who put it there?

A: I did.

Q: When did you put it there? 

A: Whenever I bought it.

Q: From the time you bought it and when you put it there, did you ever
use it?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever see it?

A: Not consciously, no.

Q: Was it visible if you were standing in front of the vanity?

A: No.

Q: Where did you buy that knife?

A: Someplace downtown.

Q: Was that Ross Cutlery?

A: Could very well be, yes.  Q: Was that during the shooting of
"Frogman"?

A: Yes.

Q: Why did you buy it?

A: Because I liked it.

Q: You went in and browsed around?

A: Actually, my--we were there about a half a day, and my seat where
they put us was virtually in the store, and various people took me in
the store and tell me things that they wanted because they handled Swiss
Army watches and knives, and during the course of hanging around all day
I bought it. 

Q: What about the knife did you like?

A: The way it looked.

Q: Was that the first time you bought a knife for aesthetic purposes?

A: I think most things that I buy are for aesthetic purposes.

Q: Is that the first time you bought a knife for aesthetic purposes?

A: I can't say that. I know in my life I've bought knives before, and
I'm sure it was because aesthetically I liked it, because I'm not really
a woodsman.

Q: So you have bought knives before just for souvenirs or to collect
them. Right?

A: When I was a kid, you know, you buy knives or-

Q: And as an adult?

A: I'm sure I have as an adult.

Q: And whatever knives you collected over the years, if you still have
them, they were in your residence. Is that right?

A: If I still have them. l don't know where they are because I haven't
seen them.

Q: You haven't seen them since your release from jail? 

A: I haven't seen them in years.

Q: When was the first time you remember purchasing a knife before May of
1994 when you purchased this knife from Ross Cutlery?

A: Probably the summer of 92 -summer of '91 or '92, I would think.

Q: What knife did you purchase then?

A: I don't know. It was like a Jim--I don't know if it was a Bowie. It
was a hunting knife sort of thing.

Q: What did you do with it?

A: I don't know.

Q: Did you ever use it?

A: No.

Q: Where did you keep it?

A: With all my camping stuff.

Q: Where is that?

A: I don't know.

Q: You don't know where your camping stuff is?

A: No.

Q: In the garage?

A: I don't know. Nicole was the camper in the family, so--and I think
she may have taken it to camp. You know, she does more camping than I
do,  so. . .

Q: Did you ever use the knife you bought from Ross Cutlery?

A: No.

Q: Where is that knife now?

A: I believe in the custody of you guys.

Q: The police took it?

A: No.

Q: Who took it?

A: A judge.

Q: Delbert Wong?

A: I have no idea.

Q: Was taken from where?

A: I wasn't with him. I was in jail.

Q: How do you know he took it?

A: I was told he did.

Q: Who told you that?

MR. BAKER: You don't have to get into that. That's-

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Is that--I'm sorry.

MR. BAKER:--protected by the attorney-client privilege.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Is that the knife in the sealed envelope? 

A: I don't know. I haven't seen the sealed envelope. Q: So it's your
testimony that from the moment you bought that knife, you took it home
that day, put it in that vanity and never touched it again. Is that
right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Did--the week before, you were back in Connecticut. Right?

A: Yes.

MR. BAKER: The week before June 12, is that what we're talking about?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, Mr. Baker.

Q: You attended a board meeting at Forschner. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And you were driven from Connecticut to Long Island, Correct?

A: Correct.

Q: By a limo driver. Right?

A: Correct.

Q: And you brought back with you from the board meeting a box of knives.
Right?

A: No, that's not correct.

Q: Did you bring back with you any knives?

A: I believe so, yes.

Q: What did you bring back?

A: I think I may have brought three --two--I brought a bunch of little
knives that were like team knives, because I dispensed them to--well,
one friend, and I brought maybe two and I can't think of the name of
this knife. It's a kind of a--it's a top-of-the-line thing with
everything involved, and I brought back a lot of boxes of watches, a lot
of boxes of watches.

Q: How many boxes?

A: I would say 13,14,15.

Q: And were the knives and the boxes all in one big box?

A: A bag, yes.

Q: A bag?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you pay for any of these items?

A: No . Q: They were given to you as promotional items for you to
distribute?

A: Yes.

Q: Did--now I want to go back to the knives. You said that there were
some team knives?

A: Yeah. 

Q: T-e-a-m.

A: Yes.

Q: What are they?

A: Some of the people I was visiting when I left there are Giant fans,
and they would have like the name of the Giants on them, and I gave them
a knife.

Q: I see.

A: And they were for key chains.

Q: Did these knives have team names imprinted on them.

A: Yes.

Q: And you had one for a number of different teams?

A: No, because I only had two or three of them.

Q: These were football teams?

A: Giants I know because the person I was going to was a Giants fan, and
I gave him one.

Q: Who was that?

A: Bobby Bender.

Q: In New York. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: He's a good friend of yours. Right?

A: Yes. 

Q: And you saw him when you came back from the board meeting. Right?

A: Yes, and I gave some watches out there also.

Q: Besides these two or three team knives, did you have any other knives
with you?

A: I'm not sure, but I may have taken one--I'm so sorry I can't think of
the name of our top-of- the-line knife.

Q: A utility knife?

A: Yeah. I can't think of the name. There's a name for it, and I
apologize. I can't think of the name of it. I may have taken one of
them. But basically I'm interested in the watches. The watches are what
I gave out. I had enough of the knives previous.

Q: You have to keep your voice up. You are trailing off.

A: Basically it was watches that--I think they took a list. I'm pretty
sure they took a list of what I--inventory of what I took.

Q: You came out with two large white shopping bags from the Forschner
warehouse. Right?

A: First, they wouldn't have been shopping bags, but I know there was at
least one large bag.

Q: And you brought the bag or bags --

A: Yeah. Q:-- into the back seat with you. Right?

A: That's correct..

Q: Do you remember the name of the driver?

A: No.

Q: Does the name John Upson ring a bell?

A: No.

Q: Did you offer to give a knife or a watch to the driver?

A: I believe I did.

Q: You believe you offered?

A: I believe I gave him.

Q: What did you give him? 

A: I don't recall. Probably that big- whatever you call it, utility
knife thing. Probably. But I could have given him a watch, but I doubt
that.

Q: Did you show the knives to Mr. Upson, the driver?

A: No.

Q: Now, you showed -- did you have with you one knife that was 12 to 16
inches long? 

A: No.

Q: Are you positive?

A: Yes. 

Q: Did you take that knife out and show it to him and make a stabbing
motion?

MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. Don't answer that question.

MR. PETROCELLI: Why not?

MR. BAKER: Because there is no foundation for it. He just said he didn't
have that knife. Now you've said, "Did you take that knife," assuming
the one that's 12 to 16 inches long, "show it to him and make a stabbing
motion?" We are not--

MR. PETROCELLI: It might refresh his recollection.

MR. BAKER: Yeah, right. No way he is going to answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Do you recall if you took a knife 12 to 16 inches
long and made a stabbing motion with it to the limo driver?

A: I know I didn't.

Q: You remember you didn't?

A: Yes.

MR. BAKER: He says he knows he didn't. How can you remember an act that
you did not do?

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What was the longest blade of the knives Pace 132

that you had with you and showed to the limo driver?

A: If I took one of our utility things, I would say whatever that blade
is, two inch maybe, two and a half, maybe an inch and a half. I really
don't know. You can get one and look at it.

Q: When showing the limo driver the knives, did you say, "You can even
kill somebody with this"?

A: l never showed the limo driver the knives. I believe I may have given
him one, but I didn't show him anything that I had in the bag.

Q: You did not even show him the knives you remember having?

A: I did not. I think I just gave him a gift.

Q: Did you say, "You can even kill somebody with this"-

A: No.

Q:--alluding to knives?

A: Absolutely not.

Q: Did you make four or five phone cal1s during that trip?

A: I believe so.

Q: To your friends?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you say you'd be a little late for golf?

A: Yes.

Q: You made some phone calls to your office?

A: Possibly.

Q: You looked at some papers?

A: Possibly.

Q: Fell asleep for about ha1f an hour?

A: Probably.

Q: Did you decide to change into golf clothes-

A: I'm pretty sure I did.

Q:--in the car?

A: I'm not sure, but I am pretty sure I would have tried if I had my
clothes in the car, yes.

Q: With respect to any of these hunting  knives or camping knives that
you purchased over the years, did any of them have a blade six inches or
longer?

A: I really don't know.

Q: You have no recol1ection at all?

A: No, I don't.

Q: Do you ever remember having in your house a hunting knife with a
blade six inches or longer?

A: No.

Q: Do you ever remember using such a knife?

A: No. I know fishing with the kids, hunting, we seem to have always had
a knife of some sort, but I don't recall when--

Q: When you have gone fishing--

A:--or what.

MR. BAKER: You have to wait until he finishes.

MR. PETROCELLI: I apologize, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: Were you finished?

THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: When you have gone hunting or fishing, do you
recall using a knife with a blade six inches or longer?

A: No, I don't recall.

Q: You don't remember one way or the other?

A: One way or the other.

Q: Okay. Can you account for all of the hunting and camping knives that
you purchased?

A: No, of course not.

Q: You can't account for them. Right?

MR. BAKER: Don't answer that.

THE WITNESS: I haven't been hunting in two years.

MR. BAKER: Don't-

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What kind of game do you hunt?

A: The one time I went hunting, I went hunting for birds once, and that
was I would say the early '70s, and I went hunting in the '60s for deer.

Q: Did you go hunting in the '80s?

A: No.

Q: And in the '90s?

A: No.

Q: Did you go fishing in the '9os?

A: I believe so.

Q: And did you use a knife?

A: I believe so.

Q: Did it have a blade six inches or longer?

A: I don't know.

Q: Where is the knife you used?

A: I have no idea. Or the fishing poles or any of it.

Q: Let's go back to the black bag that we looked at which was marked as
the Exhibit 1064 in the criminal case. When you put the gun into the
bag, what did you do with the bag that evening?

A: Probably put it in my bedroom.

Q: Did you put anything else into it?

A: That night- 

Q: Yes.

A:--no.

Q: Now, you left--you slept at your house that night. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: You went to the Kardashian house the next morning?

A: Yes.

Q: And took the black bag with you?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you take any other luggage with you?

A: I'm not sure. I think l took another bag, but I'm not real1y sure.

Q: Okay. And when you went to the Kardashian house with the black bag,
where did you keep it while you were there?

A: I put it in a closet.

Q: In the bedroom in which you slept?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you ever go to that black bag during the time you were at the
Kardashian house before you left the home on Friday morning?

MR. BAKER: And after he placed it there?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

THE WITNESS: I don't believe--because I took some pictures out of it
then, I don't believe so.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What pictures did you take out of it?

A: The pictures that I had carried over to Kardashian's house.

Q: These are the three family pictures you mentioned-

A: Yes.

Q:--before?

A: Yes.

Q: And you took them from your home in Rockingham.

A: Yes.

Q: And you put them in the black bag?

A: Yes.

Q: Where did you take them from in Rockingham, what location?

l A: Wherever they were. Wherever they were.

Q: In your bedroom?

A: I don't know.

Q: Put them in the black bag?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you put anything else in the black bag?

A: I think I put some socks and some underwear in the black bag.

Q: The same bag?

A: Yes.

Q: Anything else?

A: Well, the gun was in there.

Q: Anything else?

A: No.

MR. PETROCELLI: We have to change tapes now. We have to take a moment.

THE VIDE0GRAPHER: This is the end of tape No.1 of volume 1. The time is
approximately 11:52, and we are off the record.

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record. The time is approximately 11
:56.This is the beginning of tape No.2 of Volume I.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: You put three photographs of your family in the black bag which you
got someplace in the house at Rockingham. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: And what did those photos depict?

A: My family.

Q: By "family," who are you referring to? 

A: Sydney, Justin, Nicole, Jason, Arnelle.

Q: Each photo had all of them in it?

A: No. It was kind of a mixture.

Q: So your four children plus Nicole.  

A: Yeah.

Q: And yourself.

A: And myself, yeah.

Q: And what was your purpose in putting those photos into the black bag?

A: Because I wanted pictures of my family with me.

Q: With you at the Kardashian house?

A: Wherever I was going, but, yes, at the Kardashian house.

Q: Did you anticipate taking them to jail?

A: No. I didn't anticipate being arrested.

Q: Why did you want to bring the pictures with you to the Kardashian
house?

MR. BAKER: Asked and answered. Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you contemplate that you would be killing
yourself?

A: No.

Q: At that point in time? 

A: No.

Q: You put some socks and underwear into the black bag?

A: Yes.

Q: What was your purpose in that?

A: To have clean socks and underwear.

Q: For how many days?

A: I didn't know.

Q: And you also brought other clothing  over. Right?

A: Yes, other clothes came over when I was over there.

Q: You brought some other clothing with you?

A: I think I did, but I know clothes came later on when I was there.

Q: You had additional clothes brought over?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. When you got to the Kardashian house -- Can you remember
putting anything else in this bag besides what you've already said?

A: I may have, but I don't recall. I don't think it could have held much
more.

Q: When you went to the Kardashian house, you put the bag immediately
into a closet?

A: I don't know about immediately, but I--before I went to sleep that
night I did, yes.

Q: Did you take anything out of it to use?

A: Yes.

Q: What?

A: My overnight kit.

Q: Anything else?

A: Not that I recall. the pictures maybe. I'm not even sure If I took
them out.

Q: And what about the socks and underwear?

A: Possibly, yes. Probably a pair of socks, a pair of underwear, I may
have, yes, the next morning.

Q: Was this a locked closet?

A: No.

Q: A closet with a door on it?

A: Yes.

Q: And on the floor?

A: Well, I kinda--I had money in my bag, so I sort of put it under some
stuff.

Q: You had money in this black bag?

A: Yes.

Q: How much money was in it?

A: A lot.

Q: How much?

A: I don't know. 

Q: When you say "a lot," more than 10,000?

A: Could have been close to l0,000, yes.

Q: When did that money get into the bag? 

A: When I went over to Bob's, I put it in--took it out of my pocket and
put it in the bag.

Q: You had $10,000 in your pocket when you went over to the Kardashian
house?

MR. BAKER: He doesn't know exactly. What he said-

MR. PETROCELLI: Roughly.

MR. BAKER: He said he approx--it could have been as much as 10,000.

MR. PETROCELLI: Approximately 10,000.

THE WITNESS: It could have been as much as 10,000.

MR. PETROCELLI: He just said it now, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: He did not. He said, "It could have been as much as l0,000."

THE WITNESS: Could have been as much as 10,000.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What is your best estimate?

A: It could have been as much as 10,000.

Q: Let's call it 10,000. 

MR. BAKER: Let's call it it could have been as much as 10,000. Let's
call it --let's be accurate.

THE WITNESS: Yeah.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You had that money in your pocket when you went to
Kardashian's. Right?

A: My pocket or my bag. I don't know exactly when I put it in the bag,
but my pocket or my bag, yes.

Q: When did you get that money?

A: What do you mean?

Q: Did you have it with you when you came back from Chicago?

A: I had maybe 3,000 or so when I got back from Chicago. yes.

Q: On your person. Right?

A: On my person, yes.

Q: And when did you get the additional funds?

A: When Officer Lange walked us in my closet when I arrived back in my
house with Skip Taft and with Bob Kardashian, I reached under a sweater
and I pulled out roughly--roughly $6,000 and said to Officer Lange in
front of Bob Kardashian, in front of Skip Taft, "At least your guys are
honest. They 

didn't take my money."

Q: Was there any money missing at all?

A: Well, I didn't know exactly what was there, so I wouldn't have known.

Q: Was that al1 the money you had there?

A: Yeah. Possibly, yeah. I may have had, you know, had some money spread
around in other places, but that I recal1, yes.

Q: Did you have any other significant sums of cash around the house?

A: What's a significant sum of cash to you?

Q: More than a couple thousand.

A: I don't know. I real1y don't know.

Q: So you took that money and put it in your pocket?

A: At that point in time, yes.

Q: And you left it there. When you got to Kardashian's house, you put it
in the black bag. Right?

A: I may have put it in the black bag before I left my house to go to
Kardashian's.

Q: When you put the bag into the closet before you went into bed that
night, the money was in the bag. Right?

A: The wad was, yes. 

Q: Which could have been as much as 10,000. Right?

A: No. Which could have been as much as S5- or $6,000.

Q: And the 3,000 was still on your person?

A: I kept it with a couple credit cards probably in my pocket.

Q: What was your purpose in bringing that money?

A: Because it was mine.

Q: Did you plan to go anywhere or use it?

A: No.

Q: Now, did you go to the black bag at all the rest of the time you were
there at the Kardashian house?

A: I'm not sure. I don't think so, but again I don't know. I was there a
week. I mean, I was there three or four days, so I don't recal1 going
there at all.

Q: You left he house on Thursday to go to the funeral. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you go to the wake?

A: Yes.

Q: That was Wednesday? 

A: I believe so.

Q: On Wednesday did you take the black bag with you?

A: No.

Q: Did you take the black bag with you to the funeral?

A: I don't think I took the black bag out of where I placed it in the
closet after I put it in the closet.

Q: And did you take anything out of the black bag before you went to the
wake?

A: As I stated, I may have taken a picture out. I'm not sure.

Q: And did you take anything out of the black bag before you went to the
funeral?

A: I don't believe so.

Q: Okay. Now, on Friday morning, originally the plan was you were going
to be driven down by Bob Shapiro to the police station. Right?

A: I believe so.

Q: At some point were you informed before you left that the plan had
changed, and now the police were coming to the house?

A: I don't recall. I do know--I do recall them saying "We have to go" a
few times. 

Q: Now, the pictures were taken of you by the doctors upstairs. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And that's where Shapiro was when you last saw him. Right?

A: I don't recall.

Q: When you left to go with Mr. Cowlings-

A: Yes.

Q:--where were the other people in the house?

A: I have no idea.

Q: What did you tell them you were doing?

A: I didn't tell them anything.

Q: To your knowledge where did they think you were?

A: I have no idea.

Q: Why didn't you tell them where you were at all times?

MR. BAKER: Well, don't answer that.. That's argumentative and assumes
that he has some obligation to tel1 everybody where he is at al1 times.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You understood that you were about to be arrested.
Right? 


A: Yes.

MR. BAKER: We have been through this. BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Didn't you believe that they should know your whereabouts at all
times?

A: Never gave it a thought.

Q: And you never gave it a thought to te11 them that you were leaving.

A: Correct.

Q: Is it your habit to carry as much as $10,000 in cash on you?

A: Yes.

Q: You usual1y carry that much?

A: If I'm going anywhere, yes.

Q: When you went to Chicago, how much did you have on you?

A: About three. Thirty-five maybe.

Q: You said that you take that much cash, Up to $10,000, when you're
going someplace.

A: Yeah, often, yes.

Q: When you left the Kardashian residence with up to $10,000 in cash,
where were you going?

A: It was in my bag at that point in time, and I took my bag with me. I
was going to the grave site, as I told you before. 

Q: Did you stil1 have in the car the 3,000 or so in your pocket?

A: Actually I had given it, to be correct, and I am correcting myself
here, I had given it all to A.C. that morning to dispense it among my
kids, my older kids, and to give Paula some money to get her a flight.

Q: You gave all of what to A.C.?

A: Whatever cash, whatever checks I had from golf, I had given it to
A.C. and told him that split it among my kids, and someone said about
Paula's flight, and to give her a couple of thousand dol1ars for her
flight.

Q: And that was the cash you had-

A: That was all the cash I had. I had --I ended up with $3 and
something, I'm told, but I don't know. I just gave him all that money,
yes.

Q: And you told Cowlings to spread it around among the kids?

A: No. I told him to split it between my daughter and my son, because I
didn't think they would want to work at this time, and to give Paula
what she needed for her flight.

Q: Arnelle and- A: Jason. 

Q: Jason.

A: And to give Paula whatever she needed for her flight.

Q: And the rest of the money, the 6500 or so, was still in the bag?

A: No. I gave him all of the money. There was no money the police ever
found in the bag that was over $3.63. That's a fallacy that you guys
have been promoting.

Q: You gave the entire sum, up to--which could have been as high as
10,000, to Mr. Cowlings in the morning?

A: Whatever it amounted to, checks or cash, I gave to Mr. Cowlings.

a How much were in checks?

A: I have no idea.

Q: Do you have roughly any idea what the amount of checks were?

A: Absolutely none. Some of them I had had for weeks. They're from golf.

Q: When you say, "They're from golf," what do you mean?

A: Money I won playing golf.

Q: People wrote you checks?

A: Yeah. When they don't have cash. 

Q: I see. And was it more than a couple thousand dollars?

A: I don't know.

Q: Could it have been as much 5,000 in checks?

A: Could have been.

Q: What is your best estimate of the total number of checks--the total
amount of the checks that you gave Mr. Cowlings that morning?

A: I have no idea.

Q: Could it have been more than $10,000?

MR. BAKER: I am not--you've exhausted that. I am going to instruct him
not to answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: When did you decide to give the money to Mr.
Cowlings?

A: In the morning when I was told --after I was told I was gonna be
arrested.

Q: Did any of these checks come from Mr. Thibodeau or Thibodeau?

A: I doubt it.

Q: Who were the checks from?

A: I don't know.

Q: Can you identify any of them?

A: No.

Q: They were all made out to you?

A: I don't know. Could be cash. Sometimes a guy will give you a check
that somebody gave them.

Q: Okay.

MR. BAKER: I've never had that experience. I give the checks.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Were the checks in an envelope, Mr. Simpson?

A: No.

Q: Did you put--When you made the decision to leave with Mr. Cowlings,
what did you decide to take with you, if anything?

A: Decide? I just grabbed my bag because it had the pictures in--and the
gun in it.

Q: And when you took that bag and you went into the Bronco, did it have
anything else in it besides the pictures and the gun?

A: Whatever else was in it, yes.

Q: From before.

A: Yeah. Except my overnight kit, my medication and stuff, because I
don't think I was thinking about packing stuff.

Q: Was there a bottle of pills that you took with you?

A: I don't recall. Not--certainly not --my medication was not in there.

Q: Were you taking any Xanax at that time?

A: Never in my life.

Q: Was there a pill vial of Xanax found in your bag?

A: I'm told there was.   Q: How did it get there?

A: I took it from Nicole.

Q: When?

A: A few weeks before this incident.

Q: Was it a prescription made out to Nicole?

A: I don't know.

Q: Where did you get it from Nicole?

A: Just from her house.

Q: The house on Bundy?  A: Yes.

Q: Where was it in the house?

A: I believe in her bathroom.

Q: Which was on which floor?

A: Second or third floor.

Q: In a medicine cabinet.

A: I don't recall.  Q: Did you take anything else on that occasion? 

A: No.

Q: Just this one bottle of pills?

A: Yes.

Q: And why did you take it?

A: Because they were having some problems, I guess, her and Dr. Fishman,
and he had some concerns, and he mentioned them to me and Nicole had
mentioned some stuff to me, and I was concerned about Nicole and what
she had been doing the previous few months of her life.

Q: Can you explain that more?

A: I was concerned about Nicole. She was having some problems.

Q What kind of problems?

A: I don't know.

Q: What kind of problems were you concerned that she was having?

A: I don't know. She was just not herself.

Q: How was she acting differently?

A: She was--ask her mother. I discussed it with her mother. I thought
she was drinking-

Q: I'm asking you now.

A: Well, she was just not herself. She was a different person every time
I talked to her. When I was in Puerto Rico, she seemed to be having a
nervous 

breakdown; she even said she was, and I suspected it was drinking. I had
hoped it wasn't pills or drugs, which I knew her friends were involved
in, and I was hoping and still hope to this day that she wasn't involved
in than

Q: And how did these problems manifest themselves in her behavior toward
you?

A: She was erratic. She was--from day to day I didn't know who she was.
Then it didn't matter to me because I got out of the relationship.

Q: Did you ever see her manifest that behavior before in your
relationship?

A: Yes.

Q: When was that?

A: Right before I went to Puerto Rico.

Q: That was about April of 1994?

A: March.

Q: Before 1994 had she ever manifested this behavior that you were
witnessing?

A: Not really. No, not like this.

Q: This was the first time you saw it?

A: Well, yes, I saw it from time to time when I was back with her, but
this--I felt it was out of control to the point that I discussed it with
her parents, and I attempted to get her to go to 

therapy again. Q: You were alarmed for her safety-

A: Yes.

Q:--and well-being?

A: Yes.

Q: And you spoke to her parents, meaning Louis and Juditha Brown?

A: Basically Judy.

Q: You call her Judy?

A: Yes.

Q: And did you say earlier, Mr. Simpson, that you spoke to Ron Fishman
about this or Dr. Fishman?

A: Yes.

Q: Is Dr. Fishman Ron Fishman?

A: Yes.

Q: Why did you speak to Ron Fishman about Nicole's problems?

A: Actually it was about his problem, but at this particular time a few
weeks before her death, he was having a problem, and Nicole actually
called me because they were having a problem

Q: What kind of problem? 

A: You'd have to ask Ron Fishman. Basically Nicole was upset with Ron.
He had just left her house. She called me at my office. Ron was having a
beef with his wife. Somehow Nicole was involved in it. It had a lot to
do with whatever these girls were doing. Nicole was concerned and called
me. I told her to get Ron Fishman's number for me. She got his number,
his car number for me.I asked him to come to my office. He came to my
office. He was agitated. I took him and made him drink some coffee and
told him to go back to work, and I went to Nicole's house to discuss it
with her.

Q: What did you discuss with Ron Fishman, if anything, about Nicole's
problems?

A: Well, it was basically about his  problems.

Q: What was the problem you and he discussed?

MR. BAKER: Well, I am not sure that has anything to do with this, and I
am going to invoke his right of privacy and instruct the witness not to
respond to those questions.

MR. PETROCELLI: Whose right of privacy?

MR. BAKER: Dr. Fishman's right of privacy.

MR. PETROCELLI: This is a conversation Dr. Fishman had with Mr. Simpson.


MR. BAKER: I am well aware of that, but I am going to stand by my
instruction and instruct Mr. Simpson not to discuss anything that he
discussed with Mr. Fishman relative to Mr. Fishman's problems unless it
somehow relates in that conversation to Nicole's problems. MR.
PETROCELLI: I think that's what he was saying, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: Well, if it does, you can, but if not, then I don't think we
need Mr. Fishman's problems brought into this matter.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Well, is the discussion that you had with {l4] Mr.
Fishman about his problems--did that involve Nicole as well?

A: Only to the fact that when he went to Nicole that morning to discuss
it with her, evidently Nicole got very agitated with him and asked him
to leave and then called me.

Q: Who called you?

A: Nicole.

Q: So the sequence of events was you first got a call from Nicole saying
that Fishman had come over to her house?

A: Yes. 

Q: She got agitated with him.

A: Evidently.

Q: That's what she told you. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And that--and she was reporting this to you for you to talk to Ron or

A: I guess so.

Q: She asked you to talk to Ron?

A: She was just telling me what was going on.

Q: And what did Ron tell--what did Nicole tell you about Ron's problems?

A: That's between Ron and his wife.

Q: But what did Nicole tell you about Ron's-

A: That's between Ron and his wife. I don't recall. You ask Ron or his
wife.

Q: I'm a little confused. Are you saying that Nicole said, "That's
between Ron and his wife," or are you refusing to tell me?

A: No. I don't remember what she told me about Ron and his wife. I don't
recall what he told me about Ron and his wife. Ask them.

Q: I know. We will ask them.

A: I don't recall. 

Q: But we are asking you now.

A: I don't recall.

Q: You don't recall what Nicole told you about Ron and his wife.

A: I don't recall what Nicole told me about Ron and his wife.

Q: And did Nicole tell you why she wanted you to call Ron?

A: Not really. She was concerned about him, I guess. because she relied
on him quite a bit over the previous two or three years when it came to
Nicole's and my divorce and I guess getting back together.

Q: She relied on Ron as a friend?

A: As a friend and as an adviser, I presume.

Q: Was Ron an internist?

A: I don't know what his practice is.

Q: Was he your doctor?

A: No.

Q: Was he Nicole's doctor?

A: As far as I know. No.

Q: And did Nicole tell you that she wanted you to tell Ron Fishman?

A: No. She just called me. I gather she was somewhat concerned and
agitated. 

Q: What did you then say to Ron Fishman?

A: I told him to come by my office.

Q: When he got there what did you say to him?

A: I walked him to the Starbucks, had him drink some coffee, told him to
get a --same advice I gave his wife: Either to get a lawyer or get a
counselor. Basically that's what I told him

Q: What day was that?

A: I don't know. A few weeks before Nicole's murder.

Q: Was it after Nicole's birthday?

A: I don't recall, but it was around that time, yes.

Q: Had you and Nicole already split up?

A: Yes.

Q: Now, what did all that have to do with the taking of the pills?

A: That was just talking about what the girls had been up to and his
concern about some things and-

Q: Ron's concern?

A: About some things about what the girls were up to relative to
drinking.

Q: "Girls" meaning who?

A: Faye, ---, ---, the whole group.

Q: Just so I am clear on this, during this occasion Ron told you that he
had concerns about ---, Nicole Simpson-

A: About the whole group, and I think the problems-

Q: Let me finish the question. ---

A: He didn't name them all, no, but he was talking about the girls, and
normally when we spoke of the girls, it was this group of girls.

Q: Describe that group by name.

A: Faye Resnick, ---, ---, Nicole, and then one or two other girls that
came in and out of the group who, you know--I think ---, people who are
--we knew had problems.

Q: And Ron told you that he was concerned that the girls-

A: No. Basically he was discussing, I

believe, as I recall, it was more concerning his wife, but evidently
whatever was going on with him and his wife he felt was affected by
whatever was going on in this group of women.

Q: And what he was telling you was an expression of a concern about
alcohol or drug use by 

these girls?

A: Whatever it was. I don't recall exactly what he was expressing. I as
a friend was just trying to tell him not to worry about the girls, to
get out of the situation, would be my advice, or take his wife--they
need to go to therapy or they need to get a lawyer, which I advised her
also.

Q: "Her" being whom?

A: ---.

Q: Did anything that Ron said to you about the girls have to do with
drugs?

A: I think the whole tone of the conversations had to do with whatever,
and drugs was obviously a part of it.

Q: Did he say to you they were taking drugs?  A: No. Not specifically,
no.

Q: Did he imply that to you?

A: I think it was all a part of the conversation.

a Did he tell you that he had prescribed the medication for Nicole?

A: No.

Q: Did he tell you that he gave pills to Nicole?

A: No. Nicole had told me that she was 

concerned at times about who was taking what type of pills, especially
Faye, and I believe she also mentioned ---.

Q: Did Ron Fishman tell you that Nicole had pills that he had
prescribed?

A: No, he didn't.

Q: Now, when you went into this medicine cabinet-

A: I don't know if it was a medicine cabinet.

Q: That's right. You said you didn't remember.

A: No.

Q: Why did you take this particular bottle of pills?

A: Because I heard them talking about Xanax, and when I saw it, I took
it.

Q: You heard who talking about Xanax?

A: Nicole from time to time; Faye from time to time; Ron from time to
time. We knew that Faye was taking them from time to time, and I assumed
they were like the new Valium or something.

Q: "Ron" being Ron Fishman?

A: Pardon me? I'm sorry?

Q: "Ron" being Ron Fishman? You said "Ron." 

A: In various conversations, yes.

Q: You're saying that you had heard discussions involving Nicole and Ron
and Faye about Xanax?

A: I've heard various people discuss it from time to time, and that was
the Xanax seemed to be something that they discussed from time to time,
yes.

Q: Did you ever talk to Nicole about her use of Xanax?

A: I talked to Nicole about her drinking more than anything, and by this
time I--other than expressing my concern to her, which was difficult to
do, most of my concerns about Nicole I expressed to her mother, and once
I got out of our relationship, which is the early part of May, I had a
long discussion for a couple days with her mother, and then after that I
didn't want to hear it anymore.

Q: Did you discuss Xanax with her mother?

A: I don't believe so.

Q: Now, when you took the Xanax, did Nicole see you take it?

A: I don't re---she may have asked me, "What is that you got, a but I
don't really recall. She may have. I don't recall.

Q: And what did you tell her? 

A: Nothing.

Q: You took it to do what with it?

A: To take it away from her.

Q: So she wouldn't use it?

A: I don't know if she was using it or if one of her friends left it
there.

Q: Did you ask her?

A: No.

Q: Do you know that the pills even belonged to her?

A: No.

Q: What did you do with them?

A: Took them back to my office.

Q: What did you do with them there?

A: Put them in my bag.

Q: Your black bag?  A: Yes.

Q: Why did you put them in your back bag?

A: Because that's the bag I had.

Q: Did you ever take any of them?

A: Never, ever in my life have I ever taken a Xanax pill.

Q: Why didn't you just throw them out?

A: I don't know. They were in my office. I threw them in the bag. 

Q: When you left Nicole's, why didn't you throw them in the garbage?

A: I probably would have if I would have cleaned out my bag one day, but
I just put them in my bag.

Q: So were the Xanax pills in your bag from that point on?

A: I never looked to see. I have zipper areas in my bag that I never go
into, so--rarely go into, so I assume they were. If they were in my bag
at this point when they got my bag, I assume they stayed there since
then.

Q: You never saw them again after you put the pills into your bag at
your office. Is that right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Who is Naomi Fishman?

A: I have no idea.

Q: Let me show you a picture of a pill vial in the possession of LAPD,
the Scientific Investigation Division, marked as their item No.158.

After the break I will figure out how to get these things put into the
record.

MR. BAKER: I think it's 148.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am sorry. I misspoke.148. 

Q: Did you see that photograph of the pill vial?

A: I don't recall. I just saw it there, yeah. I just saw it just now.

Q: Let me put it in front of you, SID item No. 148. Is that the bottle
of Xanax that you took from Nicole's bathroom?

A: I really couldn't tell you.

Q: Does it look like it?

A: It looks like all pill vials to me.

Q: When you picked up the pill vial, did you read the name of the person
to whom the prescription was made out?

A: I'm pretty sure I did.

Q: Did you know who Naomi Fishman was when you read it?

A: I don't think I registered that. I just noticed Nicole's name wasn't
on it.

Q: Did you ask Ron Fishman about this pill bottle that you took?

A: No.

Q: Did you ask him how pills in the name of Naomi Fishman got to Nicole?

A: No.

Q: You never talked to him at all about the pill vial?

A: Never, ever.

Q: Did you ever ask anybody about how this got to Nicole?

A: Never.

Q: And you never asked Nicole?

A: No.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's 12:30now.We will take a break for lunch.

(At the hour of 1:27 p.m., the deposition of ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON was

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is

EXAMINATION (Resumed) BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Mr. Simpson, can you
remember whether there was anything else in that black bag when you left
Cowlings'--Kardashian's house on the 17th of June other than what you've
said so far?

A: Well, I know there were things in there. I don't--you know, I always
keep my credit cards, I have a whole book of credit cards that I always
keep in there, and cards, business cards. It's just a folder that I keep
everything in. And, you know, I hadn't done an inventory of, obviously,
what's in there, but I would imagine over a period of time I put things
in there and they stay in there. I've seen a list since then, so I see
watches and stuff in there also.

Q: WHAT kind of watches?

A: Probably Swiss Army watches and maybe a better watch. I don't know.
I'm not sure. But there were other watches. I don't remember
specifically 

exactly what watches.

Q: Where are the three pictures now?

A: I have no idea.

Q: To your knowledge were they confiscated by the police?

A: I would assume so. They were left in the Bronco.

Q: You took them with you?

A: NO. They were left in the Bronco.

Q: You took them when you went into A.C.'s Bronco. Is that right?

A: They were in my bag, yes, so they went with me.

Q: And that's the last you saw of those pictures: When they were in
A.C.'s Bronco?

A: Yes.

Q: Never seen them again?

A: I don't recall. I don't recall seeing them again, no.

Q: Have you asked for them back?

A: I asked for everything back.

Q: Have you ever gotten those back?

A: I don't think--other than my passport and this ring (Indicating), I
don't think I've gotten anything else back.

Q: At the Kardashian house, the bedroom where you slept and the closet
where the bag was were the same room. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And was that room located downstairs or upstairs?

A: Upstairs.

Q: Upstairs.

A: Yes.

Q: And where you had the examination by the doctors was also upstairs.
Right?

A: I believe so, yes.

Q: Okay. When you went to Kardashian's house from Rockingham sometime on
the 14th,what was your purpose in doing so?

A: To get away from the press and to see my kids.

Q: And how long were you planning to stay?

A: When I went there originally, I had no plans.

Q: You weren't planning to stay there indefinitely. Right?

A: That's what I meant: I had no plans, so that's why I didn't bring a
whole lot of stuff.

Q: You were planning to stay for a couple 

days and then come back. Right?

A: Yeah. Yeah.

Q: In light of that, why did you go and make a point of getting the
money and bringing all that money under the sweater with you?

A: I don't understand why "all that money." I carry my money with me all
the time normally.

Q: But this money was tucked away under a sweater for a rainy day.
Right?

A: No.

Q: Why was it under a sweater?

A: Because I didn't want to leave it on the table.

Q: How long had that money been there?

A: Since I came back from New York where I won most of it--or a lot of

Q: Oh, the cash that was in the sweater was largely winnings from golf?

A: Not largely--oh, yeah, yes. Overall, yes, largely winnings from golf.
Not necessarily over those three days, but probably over a week's period
of time, yes.

Q: With friends?

A: Yes.

Q: Guys who play golf regularly? 

A: Yes.

Q: ANd again, what was your reason for taking the money to Kardashian's?

A: Same reason I have for taking money wherever I go.

Q: Well, you didn't take the money to Chicago.

A: I took $3500 to Chicago.

Q: Right. So why did you go and get another 6500 and take it with you to
go to Kardashian's house?

A: Because it was there, and I put it in my bag, and I didn't know how
long I'd be at Kardashian's.

Q: Did you use any of the money at Kardashian's?

MR. BAKER: Other than what he has previously testified to: Giving it to
Al Cowlings?

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Wel1, let me ask you about that. Other than giving
it to Al Cowlings, did the money go anywhere else?

A: No.

Q: Now, did Mr. Cowlings ever give it back to you? A: No. 

Q: What happened to it?

A: I'm assuming that he gave it to my kids.

Q: Have you ever found that out?

A: I'm sure he told me he did, yes.

Q: DId he give any of it to Paula?

A: Yes.

Q: How much?

A: Whatever it took for her to get her a first class ticket out of L A.

Q: Did he tel1 you that he did that?

A: I think Paula may have said that.

Q: Did you see him do it?

A: No.

Q: And to your knowledge he gave the rest of the cash plus those checks
to your kids.

A: My kids and--yeah, wel1, that's who I told him to dispense it among,
so I'm assuming he did.

Q: And by 'kids,' you mean-

A: My older two kids.

Q:Arnel1e and Jason?

A: Yes.

Q: DId you give him instructions to give any of that money or checks to
anyone else?

A: No.

Q: DId you make any arrangements at all 

during that week at Kardashian's house, including all day Friday, to
acquire any other cash?

A: No.

Q: Or to have anybody get any other cash?

A: No.

Q: So the only cash that you had any

interest in getting or keeping was that money in the sweater and the
money you had on your person. Right?

MR. BAKER: I object. That's argumentative.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, I'll withdraw it. Q: The only cash that you had
with you that entire week was the money from the sweater and the money
you had in your person. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And you didn't ask anybody to get any other cash from anyplace else
that whole week. Is that right?

A: That's correct.

Q: And did anybody get any cash from any other sources?

A: Not to me, no. Not to me, no.

Q: Did anybody get any cash that belonged to you from any other sources?

A: I don't know. I don't know.

Q: Do you have any information that anybody 

got money that belonged to you from some other location?

A: No

Q: You have no such information. Is that correct?

A: That's correct.

Q: When you--Is it fair to say that you made the decision to go to the
cemetery and not wait for the police shortly before you left in the
Bronco with Mr. Cowlings?

A: Yes.

Q: In other words, did you make the decision earlier in the day and
decide that with Cowlings, or did you make it later in the day? How did
that work?

A: Just the way you asked it. the way I answered it, is how it happened:
Shortly before  left, I made the decision.

Q: When you made that decision with Cowlings, where were you?

A: I think in the kitchen.

Q: And where is the kitchen: Upstairs or downstairs?

A: Downstairs.

Q: So what you had to do then before leaving was go upstairs and
retrieve the bag. Is that 
right?

A: That's correct.

Q: Okay. And when you did so, you saw other people in the house. Right?

A: I don't think so.

Q: And you didn't--you've said already you didn't tell anybody that you
were leaving. Right?

A: Right.

MR. BAKER: You don't have to answer it again.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you tell anybody that you were going to your
bedroom to get your bag?

A: No.

Q: Did anybody see you go to the bedroom?

A: I don't think so.

Q: Did anybody see you leave the bedroom with your bag?

A: I don't think so.

Q: Where was everyone else?

A: I don't know.

Q: When you went into the bedroom, did you get anything else besides the
bag?

A: No.

Q: Did you put anything into the before you left?

A: I'm not sure. If I'd taken one of the pictures out, I may have put it
in the bag.

Q; Wasn't your passport on the side table?

A: No.

Q: You're positive of that?

A: Yeah. l read everything you read The answer is no.

Q: Did you read any statement by. Miss Barbieri-

A: Yes.

Q:--that the passport was on the table?

A: Yes.

Q: And she's incorrect?

A: Yes.

Q: Have you discussed that with her?

A: No.

Q: WheN you said you've read everything I've read, what have you read,
Mr. Simpson?

A: I've read most of the discovery in this case.

Q: WhaT do you mean by a discovery?

A: I don't know. You tell me. Whatever discovery is. Q: You've read a
number of witness   
statements?

A: Yes. Q: You've read the trial transcript?

A: No. Q: Any part of it?

A: No. Q: Have you read any of the transcripts of the preliminary
hearing?

A: Transcripts, no. Q: Have you read any of the transcripts of the Grand
Jury proceeding

A: Yes. Q: - in your matter?

A: Yes.

Q: And in Mr. Cowlings' matter?

A: Only in Mr. Cowlings' matter. don't think it was my matter.

Q: WheRe are these documents that you read?

A: I don't know.

Q: When you read them, where were they?

A: In jail.

Q: Did you read any of these documents after you got out of jail?

A: No.

Q: Did you read any of them in preparation for this deposition?

A: No.

Q: Earlier you described that--you wouldn't answer questions about
certain tape recordings and video recordings, if there were any, in the
presence of your lawyers or under the direction of your lawyers.

MR. BAKER: Don't answer.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's a foundational statement.

MR. BAKER: Well, it's a preamble that is absolutely vacuous of any
importance.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. Well, the importance will now appear. Q: Who are
those lawyers?

MR. BAKER: Well, you don't have to respond who your lawyers.

His lawyers are of record in this case.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Who were all of the lawyers of record in your
criminal case?

A: That I know? Johnnie Cochran, Bob Shapiro, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Blaiser,
Mr. Scheck, Mr. Neufeld, Mr. Oleman, Mr. Douglas, Miss Chapman. For a
while Sarah--I can't think of her last name. 

Then there was another person with Shapiro, and I don't remember her
name, and then there's other people that came in and went, and I don't
remember their names. Oh, Mr. Dershowitz. I'm sorry.

Q: Have you left anybody out?

A: I'm sure I have, but. . .

Q: Have you consulted with any of those lawyers in preparation for this
deposition?

MR. BAKER: Instruct him not to answer on the attorney-client privilege.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Have you reviewed any documents in  connection
with this deposition, to prepare for it, I should say, in the last three
weeks?

A: Yes.  Q: What did you review?

A: My divorce and I believe my divorce deposition.

Q: Anything -- you said your divorce deposition. Anything else?

A: Probably Nicole's divorce deposition.

Q: Anything else?

A: I believe--I didn't read it all-the police -- the thing with the
police.

Q: What thing? 

MR. BAKER: Your statement?

THE WITNESS: Yes. MR. BAKER: The recorded statement?

THE WITNESS: The recorded statement, that portion of it, yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: The statement to Vannatter and Lange?

A: Yes.

Q: Is that what you meant by "recorded statement?" A: Yes.

Q: Now, your lawyer put the word "recorded" there. Is there some other
statement that was made that was not recorded?

A: A lot, yes.

Q: What are those statements?

A: Whatever the police were asking me that  day.

Q: You mean there's a portion of the statement that's not recorded that
you gave to the police?

A: Yes. Yes, quite a bit, as a matter of fact.

MR. BAKER: What I'm talking about is the conversations that he had with
the police other-

MR. PETROCELLI: I know what you're talking about. He's talking about
something differently, though

MR. BAKER: No, he is not.

MR. PETROCELLI: Let him testify. Okay?

MR. BAKER: I think I've really let him testify.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm not complaining so far, except for a couple of
parts, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: I'm euphoric.

MR. PETROCELLI: I know you are. Q: Anyway, during this taping--during
this statement that you gave to Detectives Vannatter and Lange, did you
make statements to them during this interview that were not recorded in
the written transcript that you saw later?

A: I answered whatever they asked, and there were some things that they
asked there that they didn't ask-

Q: That they didn't what?

A: I answered whatever they asked, and there are obviously some things
they never asked, from what I can see in the recorded statement.

Q: What I am asking you is: Was there anything that the recorded
statement failed to reflect that you believe was said to them?

A: I don't understand that I'm sorry.

Q: Did the recorded statement pick up everything that was said between
you and Detectives Vannatter and Lange?

A: During the time that they recorded it?

Q: During the time they talked to you in the room when they recorded it,
yes.

A: During the time the recording was on, it appears to me that, from
what I can recall. it recorded everything that we talked about while the
recording was on.

Q: Now, was there a part of the discussion you had with them during that
time that was not when the tape recording was on?

A: What do you mean? In the middle of the tape?

Q: Or the beginning or end of it.

A: Quite a bit.

Q: Quite a bit?

A: Yes.

Q: Have you ever seen any documents or tapes or any other materials
reflecting what you said and what they said during those portions of the
discussion? 

A: No.

Q: You testified just a few moments ago that shortly before leaving in
the Bronco with Mr. Cowlings, you went upstairs and got the bag, and
then when you got that bag, did you then immediately go downstairs and
to the car?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you stop to talk to anybody?

A: No.

Q: Okay. Had you already by this point in time given the money to Mr.
Cowlings?

A: Oh, yes, l had given it to him much earlier than this.

Q: How much earlier?

A: I don't know. Shortly after I was told that I was being arrested, and
I think Mr. Shapiro told me I can only have so much money or something
to take, you know, downtown.

Q: So earlier that day--in the morning, I should say, you gave the money

A: Whenever he showed up, yes.

Q: Whenever who showed up?

A: A.C.

Q: And that's when you told--gave him the instructions to give it to the
children. Correct? 

A: Yes.

Q: The two older children.

A: Yes.

Q: Did you and Mr. Cowlings discuss what you would do after visiting the
cemetery?

A: No.

Q: Did you have any plan at that time?

A: No.

Q: You didn't know where you were going to go after the cemetery?

A: I never even thought about it. I just wanted to get to Nicole's
grave, yes.

Q: Have you been to Nicole's grave since you got out of jail?

MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. That's irrelevant and immaterial. I'm not
going to let him get into that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: How many times have you been to Nicole's grave?

MR. BAKER: Don't answer that either.

MR. PETROCELLI: What's the objection?

MR. BAKER: Well, we're talking about obviously after he got out, and
that has been a media circus, and I am not going to put OJ. through that
without a court order.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am not sure I understand what you're saying, Mr.
Baker.

MR. BAKER: He has attempted to visit the grave site and has been
besieged, beleaguered by media people, and we're not-

MR. PETROCELLI: Let him testify to that. I didn't know that.

MR. BAKER: We are not going through it again. I don't see any relevance
to whether or not Mr. Simpson has anything to do with the unfortunate
deaths of Nicole Simpson Brown or Ron Goldman.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's relevant to the question of his motive to kill
them.

MR. BAKER: Well, that's about as farfetched as I can imagine, but-

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Let me say, since you got out of jail, have you
attempted to visit the--

MR. BAKER: I'm not going to let him answer that either.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q:--grave site of Nicole?

MR. BAKER: It's irrelevant and immaterial to any issue in this case. I'm
not going to let him answer that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Do you instruct him not to answer?

MR. BAKER: I do.

MR. PETROCELLI: Just so the record is clear, when you say, "I'm not
going to let him answer," is that the equivalent to an instruction not
to answer?

MR. BAKER: Yes. I'll agree to that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Now, when you got to the grave site, were you
still-- or near or outside the entrance to the cemetery, I should say,
were you still sitting in the passenger side of the car?

A: Yes.

Q: At some point did you get out of the passenger side and go into the
back seat?

A: Yes.

Q: When did that occur?

After we couldn't get in, we went and parked somewhere and we were
waiting, and A.C. I think got out of the car, and I got in the back and
laid down.

Q: Now, where did you park?

A: In an orange grove.

Q: Near the cemetery? 

A: Yes.

Q: How long were you parked there?

A: I have no idea.

Q: Do you have any sense if it was a

A: No.

Q:--short time? Long time?

A: No.

Q: More than an hour?

A: I have no idea.

Q: When you parked there, did you sit in the passenger side, or did you
go immediately to the back floor?

A: I didn't go immediately. I did not go immediately to the back portion
of the car.

Q: Where did you go to the back portion?

A: Sorry?

Q: Where in the back did you go?

A: Just in the back of the Bronco. He had the seats where there was no
back seats, and there was an area that I just laid down back there.

Q: Was the purpose of laying down so that no one could see you?

A: No. Because they couldn't see us where we were parked. l just laid
down because I was tired.

Q: Did you and he have a talk in the Bronco while you were parked?

A: I can't say it was a conversation. We turned on the radio then and
realized what was going on.

Q: What did you hear on the radio?

A: That they were hunting for me.

Q: And then did you at that time make a decision what to do?

A: No.

Q: So you did not immediately upon hearing that they were hunting for
you decide to go back to Rockingham. Right?

A: Exactly.

Q: By hunting for you, you mean the police were looking for you. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And you did not decide at that time to go back to the police--to go
to the police station Right?

A: Right.

Q: What did you and A.C. discuss you would do?

A: Nothing. We were waiting, and hopefully the police would leave the
entrance, and then I could go to the grave site. 

Q: Could you see the police at the entrance from your vantage point?

A: Oh, no. No. No.

Q: Did you make a few trips to the entrance in the car?

A: No.

Q: so you were just going to wait for a while and then go?

A: Yes.

Q: Is that what you did?

A: We waked for a while. Then we began to come home.

Q: After you waited for a while, did you then go once more to check out
the entrance?

A: I don't believe so. I think A.C. said he was taking me home.

Q: And you then got in the back of the car--or you were there already.

A: Yes.

Q: And he gets in and drives home. Is that right?

A: Yes.

Q: Where did he go when he left the Bronco? You said he got out?

A: I guess he went and took a leak, 

something. Who knows.

Q: Just gone for a short time?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you say good-bye to him when he left?

A: No.

Q: Were you planning to kill yourself in the back of the car?

A: I don't know what I was doing. I was -- I don't know what I was
thinking.

Q: At any time when you were in the passenger seat of the front of the
Bronco, did you ever have your gun out of the bag?

A: No.

Q: And when you were in the back of the car, did you have your gun out?

A: Yes.

Q: And the gun was in the black bag which was in the back of the car.
Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And what did you--when did you first take out the gun?

A: I don't know.

Q: Now, the gun was in a case, right that violin-like case that you
described earlier?

A: I don't remember if it was still in that. I don't recall if it was
still in that.

Q: Did you not take the case with you?

A: I don't recall if I took the case. 

Q: What happened to the case?

A: I don't know.

Q: Did you leave the case at Mr. Cowlings'--I mean at Mr. Kardashian's
house?

A: No.

Q: Did you even take the case to Mr. Kardashian's house?

A: I don't really know.

Q: When is the last time you've seen this case?

A: When-- for sure, when I was looking at it after it was taken out of
my car, which would have been Monday night.  Q: On the 13th.

A: Yes.

Q: So to your knowledge it's not at your house now. Right?

A: To my knowledge, it's not.

Q: When Mr. Cowlings said he was taking you back, where did you and he
discuss you would be taken to?

A: We didn't have a discussion. He was talking to me to try to keep my
attention on him, I think, and he got on the telephone immediately, and
I think he called the police and called my home.

Q: And then did he tell you where he was taking you?

A: Home.

Q: "Home" meaning Rockingham. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you ask him to take you someplace else?

A: Not in so many words, no.

Q: Did you tell him you didn't want to go back to Rockingham.   A: No.

Q: Did you tell him you wanted to stay longer and wait to see Nicole?

A: No.

Q: Do you remember anything you said to him?

A: "Take me to my mother."

Q: Take you to your mother.

A: Yeah.

Q: Where was your mother living at that time?

A: Living?

Q: Where was she staying? 

A: I assumed she was at my house.

Q: At Rockingham.

A: Yes.

Q: I see. So you wanted Mr. Cowlings to take you to see your mother at
Rockingham.

A: Yes, basically.

Q: Why did you want to see your mother at that time?

A: Because she's my mother.

Q: You wanted support from her?

A: I wanted to be with my mom.

Q: At what point in this ride back-well, let me ask you this: Once he
turned on the car to drive back to Rockingham, did you go straight to
Rockingham without any stops?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you remember the route that was taken?

A: No.

a And this whole route, you were in the back of the car. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: And you were lying down. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: You were also were also on the telephone?

A: I don't recall. 

Q: Did Mr. Cowlings have a cell phone?

A: Yes.

Q: Was it mounted to the car, or was it a freestanding cell phone?

A: I don't know.

Q: Did you have a cell phone?

A: Yes.

Q: Where did that cell phone come from?

MR. BAKER: I don't know what you mean, where did it come from.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You said you brought the black bag, and you didn't
indicate that you brought anything else, and you haven't so far said
that the cell phone was in the black bag.

A: More than likely it was in the black bag.

Q: Was it?

A: If it was in the Bronco, and I'm sure the police have it, and I had
it obviously it must have been in the black bag.

Q: Okay. Well, let me ask you some questions about the cell phone. How
many cell phones did you have?

A: One that I know of. I've had others, but they get ripped off. So one.
One that I can think of.

Q: What was the phone number of that cell phone?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Is this a cell phone that you could use in the Bronco?

A: Yes.

Q: By putting it onto a mounted stand?

A: Yes.

Q: And when it was on the stand, it would also charge?

A: I guess so.

Q: But you could take it off the stand and use it without any cords.
Right?.

A: Yes.

Q: When you took it off the stand to use, did you have to put a battery
pack on it?

A: No. 

Q: So you just take it right off and use it. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Did it have a battery pack that came with it?

A: Yes.

Q: And it was attached to the back of it?

A: Yes.

Q: You could also put that same cell phone into a bracketed stand in the
Bentley?

A: Yes.

Q: So you didn't have two cell phones, but one for both cars. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you take that cell phone with you to Chicago?

A: Yes.

Q: And again, it had its battery pack. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Was there more than one battery pack?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you have two battery packs in your black bag: One on the phone
and a spare one in the bag?

A: I believe so.

Q: Did you- 

MR. BAKER: Do you mean - at what point are we talking about? Are we
talking about Chicago?

MR. PETROCELLI: On the trip to Chicago.

MR. BAKER: Okay.

THE WITNESS: Yes. 

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you have a battery charger also to charge the
battery packs?

A: I don't-

MR. BAKER: You mean with him-

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

MR. BAKER:--on the trip to Chicago?

MR. PETROCELLI: No. I'm sorry. I'm talking about the trip to Chicago and
the black bag.

THE WITNESS: No. I don't believe so, no.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: WHEN you arrived back from Chicago on the morning
of the 13th, you had your cell phone in the black bag. Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Were you still able to use it? In other words, did the batteries
still have any charge left in them?

A: I'm not sure.

Q: You don't remember?

A: No, because I had been trying to

make a lot of calls.

Q: Do you remember having to switch battery packs during the trip

A: No.

Q:--to Chicago and back from Chicago?

A: No.

Q: And did you use your cell phone during the day of the 13th?

MR. BAKER: After he got back from Chicago?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

THE WITNESS: I don't think so.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: So when you got back to Rockingham and let's say
before you went to the police station, the phone is in the black bag
together with the spare battery charger. Is that right?

A: I believe so.

Q: And did you use it at all the rest of the week up to the Friday, the
17th?

A: I might have, but I don't know.

Q: Did you use it at all at Kardashian's house?

A: I don't think so.

Q: Okay. Do you know for a fact that the cell phone was in the black bag
when you went up to the second floor to get the black bag before you
left in the Bronco on the 17th?

124] A: If I had it with me in the Bronco, which I did, so it must have
still been in my black bag. 

Q: Did you use the phone going down to the cemetery?

A: Yes.

Q: And you used it on the way back, too. Is that right?

A: I might have. Yeah.

Q: Then is the first time that you took the gun out with the bullets in
it and put it to your head?

A: And put it to my head?

MR. BAKER: Assuming he ever-

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Let me ask you that question. Did you ever do so?
Did you ever take the gun out of the black bag and put it --and hold it
to your head?  

A: I took it out, and I was laying, so I don't think I physically held
it to my head, but I certainly had it out, yes.

Q: What was your purpose in taking the gun out of the bag and putting it
in your hand?

A: Using it.

Q: To kill yourself?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you ever cock the gun?

A: No 

Q: In order to fire that weapon, do you have to first trigger a safety
device?

A: I've never fired it, so I don't know.

Q: Did Mr. Cowlings try to stop you from using it?

A: I think when he saw it is when he started telling me, "I'm taking you
home," and that's when he just started the car up and started heading up
the freeway. He was talking to me.

Q: And how-

MR. BREWER: Keep your voice up, please.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Was the gun just--was the gun encased in anything
in the black bag?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Was there a green towel?

A: I don't recall.

Q: Were you talking about suicide to Mr. Cowlings on the way down to the
cemetery? 

A: No.

Q: And when you were parking there--where did you say you were parked?
In a grove of some sort?

A: Yeah. 

Q: Were you talking about suicide then? 

A: No. 

Q: And then when you got in the back and started to head on home, did
you start talking about suicide with Mr. Cowlings? 

A: No 
Q: So on your own, that is, without bringing the subject up with Mr.
Cowlings, you just reached in and took out the gun and contemplated
killing yourself. Is that right?

A: That's correct. 

Q: And how long did you actually keep the gun out?

A: I have no idea. 

Q: When did you put it--Did you ever put it back in the bag?

A: I don't think so. 

Q: Did you ever let go of it?

A: I don't recall.  

Q: Did you ever relinquish it back to Mr. Cowlings?

A: No. 

Q: When you left- 

A: Back to Mr. Cowlings?

MR. BAKER: Yeah, I don't- 

MR. PETROCELLI: Not back to him. Excuse me. 

Q: Did you ever give it to Mr. Cowlings?

A: No. 

Q: When you left the Bronco that evening was when you arrived at
Rockingham. Is that right?

A: Pardon me?

Q: When the Bronco arrived at Rockingham m that evening is when you left
it?

A: Yes. 

Q: And did you have the gun with you when you walked out?

A: When I got out of the Bronco? 

Q: Yes. 

A: No. 

Q: Left it in the car? 

A: Yes.  

Q: In your bag?  

A: I don't think so. 

Q: At that moment, coming back to go home to see your mother, why did
you want to kill yourself?

A: Excuse me?

Q: When you were driving back in the Bronco to go see your mother, why
did you want to kill yourself?

A: I don't think I did at that point in time. 

Q: On the way back from the cemetery to Rockingham--and you testified
you went to Rockingham because you wanted to go see your mother who was
there. Is that right? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Why did you take the gun out in m contemplation of using it to kill
yourself?

A: I had taken the gun out when I was in the grove and A.C. was not in
the car.

Q: Why did you consider killing yourself, given that you had wanted to
go see your mother?

MR. BAKER: That's pretty argumentative. You can answer why you wanted
to.

THE WITNESS: You're talking two different times, too. 

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What are the two different times I'm talking?

A: My mother hadn't come up when I was contemplating that. When A.C.
came back to the Bronco and saw me, he started talking to me, and when
he started talking to me, I told him to take me to my mom, or he said,
"I'm taking you home." And I said, "Yeah, take me to my mom," and he
kept talking to me as he drove up the freeway. 

Q: And as he drove up the freeway, though, you still had the gun out.
Right?

A: Yes.

Q: Now, by the way, did you ever put the gun to your head?

A: I don't recall.

Q: How close to any part of your body did you put the gun?

A: It was laying on my chest.

Q: On your chest. Did you ever point it at yourself?

A: I don't recall doing that.

Q: Why did you want to kill yourself during the time when you took the
gun out?

A: I was feeling a lot of pain, and I wanted it to stop.

Q: And what was the cause of that pain?

A: Losing Nicole.

MR. BAKER: That assumes he knows, but-

MR. PETROCELLI: He said, "Losing Nicole."

THE WITNESS: Part of it was Nicole, and part of it was just, I don't
know, everything, losing Nicole. I was just feeling depressed, I guess.

MR. BREWER: Mr. Simpson, I can't hear what you are saying. I am going to
reask the questions if I can't hear.

THE WITNESS: Just everything that happened that week: Losing Nicole,
part of it. Just it was a tough week.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Losing Nicole, and the other part of it m was
feeling attacked?

A: That was part of it, yes.

Q: Were there any other reasons?

A: Why I was--why I thought about it, no. I was on medication. Someone
told me that that didn't help me at that time, but who knows why anybody
does this kind of thing. I don't know.

Q: You have been attacked publicly from time to time in the past before
this incident. Correct?

A: Virtually never.

Q: People have made negative comments about you in the press or in the
public?

A: If they have, it's been very, very rarely.

Q: This is the first time in your life that you experienced an attack
from the public?

A: First time I ever lost someone like that, yes.

Q: Well, l am not talking about the losing Nicole part of it. I am
talking about the other part of it, which was feeling attacked by I
think you said certain members of the press.

A: Yes.

Q: Are you saying that you never before had felt attacked by certain
members of the press?

A: No, not that I felt anything. Someone criticized acting or saying I
ran through the wrong hole, such immaterial stuff that I never felt
anything from it, even though I was very sensitive to any criticism.
Those are things I could work on. This is not something that you work
on.

Q: And this attack was, as you're saying, much different. Right?

A: Yeah, it felt obviously -- obviously it was much different, yes.

Q: How was it different?

A: They were talking about--implying that I possibly could have taken a
human being's life. That was different than anything I've ever
experienced in my life.

Q: But you believed you were innocent. Right?

A: I don't believe nothing. I am innocent.

Q: Then you were confident that you would be acquitted. Right?

A: I didn't think I'd be arrested until then, and by then I was in so
much pain for Nicole, I wasn't thinking about the police at that point.
Those weren't things--being arrested was not something that was on my
mind at that time.

Q: Well, at the time you had that gun out in that Bronco, though, you
knew you were going to be arrested, and you knew- 

A: I could care less.

Q: - and you knew the police were hunting for you.

A: And I could care less about what the  police was thinking. It was how
I was feeling, and that's why that gun was out, is because I felt I was
in a lot of pain and I couldn't handle it at the time. I didn't feel I
could handle it at the time.

Q: Was the pain of losing Nicole so great that you were prepared to
deprive your children of their parents?

MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. That is outrageous.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am trying to understand the witness'- 

MR. BAKER: I don't care what you're trying to do. That's an outrageous
argumentative question, and he is not going to answer it.

MR. PETROCELLI: You instruct him not to answer?

MR. BAKER: You bet.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Well, let me ask you this: Before you went in that
Bronco, had you made arrangements with anyone for the care of your
children?

A: Well, yes.

Q: What arrangements did you make?

A: What arrangements. There are certain people that I asked to, you
know, see if they can help if anything came up with my kids.

Q: You mean to help in case you killed yourself. Is that what you mean?

A: That was a possibility, yes.

Q: I just want to understand what you're saying. When you say "if
anything came up," I just want to make sure I understand what you're
saying. 

A: Yes. 

Q: Okay. And who were those people?

A: Mainly Wayne Hughes and I believe Louis Marx.

Q: Who is Louis Marx? 

A: A businessman. 

Q: Friend of yours?

A: Yes. 

Q: And Wayne Hughes?

A: Businessman who is a friend of mine. 

Q: What arrangements did you make with Mr. Hughes about your children?

A: Not an arrangement. I just asked him to look after my kids, to make
sure that--whatever. If something happened, look after my kids. 

Q: And by the "kids," are you now referring to Justin and Sydney? 

A: Yes, and probably also to an extent my older kids. 

Q: Did you tell Mr. Hughes to financially provide for them. 

A: No. 

Q: Help guide them and give them counsel?

A: Whatever. Whatever I-- whatever. 

Q: Did you give him any specific instructions?

A: No.

Q: What about Mr. Marks? What did you tell him regarding your kids?

A: Pretty much the same thing.

Q: And who did you understand would be caring for your children?

A: At that point I would assume, and I didn't really give it a lot of
thought, but I would assume Lou and Judy Brown.

Q: Did you-

A: Or Arnelle Simpson and my family.

Q: Or Jason?

A: No. More Arnelle and my family.

Q: Did you have any discussions with the Browns those days that you
--something might happen to you and that they should take care of the
children?

A: No. 

Q: Or with any member of Nicole's family?

A: Other than whatever brief conversation I had with Lou when I first
got in the Bronco. Other than that, no. 

Q: Are you talking about Mr. Cowlings'  Bronco?

A: Yes. 

Q: On the 17th?

A: Yes. 

Q: And you called Lou?

A: Yes. 

Q: Tell me about that discussion. 

A: I don't remember the discussion. You should ask Lou.

Q: Do you recall it?

A: I recall that I spoke with him, yes.

Q: You don't remember what you said?

A: No.

Q: Do you know why you called him?

A: Not really, no. I called Nicole's house, and Lou was there.

Q: When you called Nicole's house, it was to speak was to speak to Lou.
Right?

A: Not really. I didn't know who would be there. If Judy was there. I'd
speak to Judy, or whoever. I was not that--well, whoever.

Q: Did there come a time, Mr. Simpson, when Mr. Cowlings made the
decision to take you back to Rockingham to see your mother, that you
decided to put in effect the gun away and you weren't going to use it?

A: I never thought about it.

Q: You never made that decision clearly in  your mind?

A: I don't think I did anything rationally that day.

Q: You were irrational that day? 

A: Well, I think any time you have a gun on your chest, you're being
irrational, yes.

Q: Have you ever acted irrationally before  in moments of severe crisis?

A: Severe crisis?

Q: Is it fair to say that you were in a period of severe crisis the week
of June 13?

MR. BAKER: Well, I am going to object. That's a characterization and
instruct him not to answer that question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you feel that you were in a severe family
crisis or personal crisis that week?

MR. BAKER: You can describe what you felt.

THE WITNESS: I felt pain, actually, when I was in the Bronco going to
--I felt at peace at that point in time, the day of the 17th, once I got
in the  Bronco and was going down there, but most of the week I was--I
don't know. I think I was obviously a little confused and in pain.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: What made you feel at peace?

A: I don't know. I just felt at peace.

Q: When you have experienced severe personal pain in your past before,
have you acted 
irrationally?

A: Yes.

Q: On when--on what occasions?

A: When my father died. When my baby drowned.

Q: What did you do irrational on those occasions?

MR. BAKER: I am not going to let him get into it. I think that's totally
irrelevant and immaterial. Instruct him not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Who else--Was the first call you made in that
Bronco to Lou Brown at Bundy?

A: I believe so.

Q: Who else did you call?

A: I don't know. I know Lou-- I mean I know Wayne and I know--I know
Louis and Wayne, and other than that, I don't know.

Q: You had spoken to Louis and- Marks and Wayne Hughes from the Bronco?

A: I believe so.

Q: You had also spoken to them earlier in  the week. Right?

A: I don't know. I don't recall.  Q: Did you call anybody else besides
Mr. Marks, Mr. Hughes and Lou Brown?

A: I may have, but I really don't recall.

Q: If you felt at peace in that Bronco, why did you want to kill
yourself?

A: Because that's why I felt at peace: I thought all my pain was about
to end.

Q: You felt that peace in contemplation of dying?

A: I felt at peace that I was going to stop feeling the way I was
feeling.

Q: Is it fair to say that virtually all of the pain you were feeling
came from the loss of Nicole?

A: Obviously it was the--yeah, the genesis of it all, but I would say
the --yes, I would say that had a lot to do with it, yes. Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Let me attach as the next exhibit in order, which would
be Plaintiffs' 6-

MR. LEONARD: Are you passing out copies?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

MR. LEONARD: That's what I need.

MR. PETROCELLI: Do you want to mark this as 6.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 6 was marked for identification by the reporter and
is attached hereto.) 

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Mr. Simpson, before I show you this document,
whatever happened to the amendment to the will that you wrote? 

A: I don't know. 

Q: Have you ever seen that again?

A: No

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry. What has this been stamped? Exhibit --

MR. PETROCELLI: 6. 

MR. KELLY: 6. 

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did you discuss with Mr. Cowlings during this
Bronco ride the question of who killed Nicole?

A: No, I don't think we had any discussion of it, no. 

Q: Did Mr. Cowlings ever ask you whether you did?

A: I think I told him I didn't, and I don't think he ever questioned me
about it after that. 

Q: He initially asked you, and you said you didn't?

A: I don't think he ever asked me. I think I may have just said it to
him early in the week, and I don't think he ever asked me about it after
that.

Q: Did you speak to Mr. Cowlings at all in preparation for this
deposition?

A: Not at all.

Q: You still see him on a regular basis?

MR. BAKER: I don't know what "regular basis" is. 

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Frequently?

A: I saw him--as an example, I ran into him on Montana Street three days
ago, and then I had seen him maybe 10 days previous to that and then
maybe a week previous to that. So if that's frequent

Q: Are you still close friends?

A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Even before this happened, I played golf and he
didn't, so we really didn't see each other that much, but we talked from
time to time, but he 's still my best friend.

Q: Okay. I have placed before you a  document marked as Exhibit 6. Do
you recognize this?

A: Yes.

Q: What is this? Can you identify it?

A: It's a letter I wrote that day, I guess.

Q: It's a letter you referred to earlier when you said you wrote down
your thoughts?

A: Yes. 

Q: Is this letter entirely in your handwriting?

A: Yes, I believe so. 

Q: Is the date of the letter in your handwriting?

A: Yes. 
Q: And all the characters?

A: Yes. 
Q: Are all of the cross-outs in your handwriting? 

A: Probably, yes. 

Q: For example. look at the next to last page.

A: Yes. 

Q: Are the cross-outs at the bottom of the bottom of the page in your
handwriting?
Let me ask: Did you cross out the material --

A: Pretty sure. 

Q: --at the bottom of the second to the last page?

A: Probably. 

Q: Any doubt in your mind?

A: I know I was in a hurry and there were a lot of things that I spelled
poorly, that didn't come out quite the way I wanted to say it, and I
just resaid it. 

Q: Do you know what you wrote here at the bottom that you crossed out

A: No.   

Q: --on the third page? 

A: No.  

Q: Have you ever tried to translate that for someone?

A: This is the first time I've looked at this since then. 

Q: You didn't look at it throughout your criminal trial?

A: No. 

Q: Now, it's dated 6-15, which is Wednesday, but you've testified you
wrote this on Friday. Is that right?

A: Yes. 

Q: Why did you date it on the 15th?

A: I guess I was just guessing at the date, and I was alone and I didn't
ask anybody what the date is. 

Q: Is it clear in your mind that you wrote this entire note on the 17th,
that Friday?

A: Yes. 

Q: And how long before you made the decision--Let me ask you this: Did
you write this note after you made the decision to leave with Mr.
Cowlings?

A: No. No. But I did--no. 

Q: When you made the decision to write this note, were you still
planning to turn yourself in?

A: I don't know. I don't really think so.

Q: Did you have any idea--With drawn. When you wrote this note, you were
expressing thoughts consistent with the idea that you would kill
yourself. Right?

A: Yeah. Yeah.

Q: And when you wrote this note, Exhibit 6, did you have any sense of
how you would do that?

A: I must have, but I can't give you any conscious thought, but I must
have, yes.

Q: Did you have a sense of when you would do so?

A: Yes.

Q: When was that?

A: Before I left Bob's house. 

Q: Before the police came. Right?

A: Yes. 

Q: When you awakened that morning did you- Withdrawn. When was the first
time you were told that you would be arrested?

A: Early that morning. 

Q: On the 17th?

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: Who told--You have to answer yes. 

A: Yes. I'm sorry. 

Q: And who told you?

A: Bob Shapiro and Bob Kardashian. 

Q: Do you remember what time it was?

A: No. 

Q: Where were you when they told you?

A: I was in bed. 

Q: They got you out of bed?

A: Yes. 

Q: When you got out of bed, do you remember what you did next?

A: No. No. 

Q: Take a shower?

A: I'm sure I did. 

Q: Got dressed?

A: I'm sure I did. 

Q: Did you eat breakfast?

A: I don't know. 

Q: Did you write this letter before or after  the doctors examined you
and took the photographs?

A: I could have been writing parts of it during the time they were doing
that.  

Q: I see. Now, this morning Miss Barbieri was present with you. Right?

A: Part of-- well, she was in the house, yes. 

Q: You wrote this letter before she left. Right?

A: Yes. 

Q: And when she left, you had no idea whether you would ever see her
again. Right? 

A: Yes.

Q: Did you and she discuss that, that this might be the last time?

A: No.

Q: Did you and she said good-bye?

A: I told her to go to Florida and find some nice guy.

Q: And was that a tearful parting?

A: The whole week was tearful for me, and I think--yes, I think she got
pretty emotional at that time.

Q: You wanted her to go back to Panama City? 

A: Yes.

Q: And that's why you--Did you give Miss Barbieri the money yourself, or
did Mr. Cowlings give it to him-her?

A: No. A.C.

Q: How did A.C. get the money?

MR. BAKER: I think we've been over that at least three times.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You said- 

MR. BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Here is what I am asking you: You said that the
money was in the black bag which is in the closet. Now, Miss Barbieri
left before you left the house. Correct. 

A: Yes. 

Q: How did Mr. Cowlings get the cash to give to Miss Barbieri?

A: I gave it to him. 

Q: So you went to the bag, took out some money, counted out a sum of
money and gave it to Al?

A: No. 

Q: Explain what you did. 

A: I went to the bag, took everything that was in there that looked like
it was money and gave it to Al. 

Q: At that point. 

A: At that point. 

Q: And Paula was still there. Right?

A: She was in the house, I'm sure. 

Q: How long before she left did you do that?

A: I don't know. 

Q: Do you know what the two words that are crossed out after the word
"understand" on the first and second line?

MR. BAKER: What page are we on?

MR. PETROCELLI: I am sorry. Page 1, "First everyone understand," and
then there are two cross-outs. Q: Do you know what those words are?

A: I don't think they're words. They're probably just- 

MR. BAKER: Looks like this has been cropped a little, too.

THE WITNESS: Yeah, I can't tell, but they don't look like they're words
to me.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You addressed this "To whom it may concern." 

A: Yeah. 

Q: WhO did you have in mind by addressing the letter that way? 

A: To whom it may concern. 

Q: Did you intend that this be read to the public?

A: No, but I wasn't going to write individual letters to everyone who's
named in here, so I thought to whom it may concern. 

Q: Did you tell anybody to read this

A: No. --to the public?

A: No, totally not. 

Q: There is a reference in this letter about the Goldman family. 

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: If I could find it. 

MR. BAKER: Bottom of page- 

MR. PETROCELLI: 3. 

MR. BAKER:--3. 

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: It says, I'm sorry for the Goldman family. I know
how much it hurts." Do you see that?

A: Yes. 

Q: You-- Did you ever meet Ron Goldman?

A: Not that I know of. 

Q: Did you ever talk to Ron Goldman?

A: Not that I know of. 

Q: Did you ever see Ron Goldman?

A: Not that I know of.

Q: Did you ever hear Ron Goldman's name mentioned prior to his death?

A: No, not that I know of.

Q: Did the name Ron Goldman mean anything to you prior to his death?

A: No.

Q: Did you ever--did anyone ever point him out to you?

A: No. 

Q: Did anyone ever point out a person whom was not identified to you by
name but who you later discovered was Ron Goldman?

Q: Not that I have any knowledge of. 

Q: You have no knowledge of ever seeing him or hearing of him, whether
by name or otherwise, before his death. Is that right?

A: No. That's correct. 

Q: That's correct?  

A: Yes. 

Q: So everything you learned about Ron Goldman was after he died, from
the news reports. Is that right?

A: Till this day?

Q: No. Up till the date you wrote this letter on the 17th of June. 

A: I didn't know anything about him. Yes, that's correct. 

Q: Had anybody -- prior to Ron Goldman's death, had anybody ever told
you that he was someone who was seeing Nicole?

A: No.

Q: Did you have any knowledge of any kind that he was in a relationship
with Nicole?

A: No.

Q: Did you have any information or knowledge that he was a friend of
Nicole's?

A: No.

Q: Did Nicole ever mention him to you?

A: No.

Q: Had you ever been to the Mezzaluna restaurant before June 12, 1994? 

A: Yes. 

Q: Had you ever seen him there?

A: Not that I would know of.

Q: So when--You've seen photos of him since his death. Correct? 

A: Yes. 

Q: At the trial, for example?

A: Yes. 

Q: When you saw a photo of Ron Goldman, did you--was there any
recognition that you had ever seen that person before?

A: No. 

Q: Since Mr. Goldman's death, has anyone ever told you about any
relationship between Ron Goldman and Nicole?

A: No. 

MR. BAKER: Don't- 

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Anyone other than lawyers. 

A: No. No. 

Q: Have lawyers told you that?

MR. BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Have you read anything to that effect?

A: I may have. 

Q: What did you read?

A: I believe in some discovery and possibly in Faye Resnick's book. 

Q: Did you read Faye's book?

A: Yes. 

Q: Did you read Mr. Kaelin's book?

A: I don't think Mr. Kaelin had a book. 

Q: Oh, Mr. Elliot's book about- 

A: No. 

Q: Did you read any of these other books that are out?

A: No. 

Q: Just Resnick's- 

A: Yes. 

Q:--and just Elliot's?

A: I didn't read Elliot's. 

Q: You didn't read Elliot's, just Resnick's. 

A: Yes. 

Q: What are the discovery materials that you're referring to?

A: Just interviews from various people. 

Q: What do you remember having read about Mr. Goldman and Nicole?

A: I think Faye Resnick, that he liked her and she liked him as a
friend, I believe was how it was described. 

Q: That was from an interview of Faye Resnick? 

A: Yes.

Q: Other than that interview, whatever it said, do you know anything
about any relationship between Ron Goldman and Nicole?

A: No. 

Q: Now, you signed this letter at the end with a happy face on it. Do
you see that?

A: Yeah. 

Q: You weren't feeling happy at the time. Right?

A: No. 

Q: Why did you do that?

A: I just wanted people to remember me that way. 

Q. As a happy person?

A: As I was most of my life until that week and maybe one or two small
instances in my life, I've  been a happy person. 

MR. PETROCELLI: I think we'll break here-

MR. BAKER: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI:-- and resume --Because of the court appearance, we are
not able to resume this afternoon, Mr. Baker. Is that right?

MR. BAKER: Yeah, I think that would be best, and we'll start at 9:00, if
that's agreeable to everybody.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Good morning, Mr. Simpson. You understand you are still 
under oath? 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: Other than talking to your lawyers, did you do anything to 
prepare for today's session of the deposition? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you review any materials? 
 
A: No. You mean from yesterday till today? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Let me clarify a couple things we discussed yesterday. When 
Phil Vannatter received your black bag, where did he get it from 
you? 
 
MR. BAKER: Are you talking about the 13th of June? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, Mr. Baker. 
 
THE WITNESS: They had me handcuffed, and the bag kept falling 
off my shoulder, so I guess that's where he got it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: We are now talking about June 13. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you drive down to the police station? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: With whom? 
 
A: Phillip Vannatter. 
 
Q: You were handcuffed at your house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you went into his car, I take it, or some LAPD 
vehicle, you took your bag with you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the bag was in the back seat with you? 
 
A: I believe it was in the trunk. 
 
Q: Trunk? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you arrived at the police station, did you take the bag out 
and take it up with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And later on that evening when you got back to Rockingham, 
Mr. Vannatter delivered the bag back to you? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And so you didn't have the bag in your possession for several 
hours? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. Why did you take the bag with you down to the police 
station? 
 
A: Well, I didn't want to leave it in my driveway. 
 
Q: You could have left it in your house. 
 
A: They wouldn't let me in my house. 
 
Q: Okay. That's the only reason? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you went to Mr. Kardashian's house I guess it was on the 
14th of June to stay there for a while, who drove you there? 
 
A: Mr. Kardashian. 
 
Q: In whose car did you go? 
 
A: His. 
 
Q: Did Mr. Cowlings spend the evenings over at the Kardashian 
house? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did anybody else spend the evenings, other than yourself-- 
 
MR. BAKER: I'm sorry. Do you mean by "spend the evenings," 
did they sleep at the house? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: Which night? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: The night of the 14th, the first night. Other than yourself and 
Mr. Kardashian. 
 
A: The night-- 
 
Q: Of the 14th. 
 
A: The night-- 
 
Q: Tuesday. 
 
A:--of the 14th, my kids. 
 
Q: Your kids. Anyone else? 
 
A: I don't--not that I know of. 
 
Q: And the night of the 15th? 
 
A: Other than people live there, you mean? 
 
Q: Who lived there? 
 
A: I guess Denise Halicki and Bob Kardashian, and they may have 
had house help that spend the night. 
 
Q: Other than those folks, on the 15th did anybody else join you 
and spend the night there? 
 
A: Paula Barbieri. 
 
Q: And she slept over there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And on the 16th? 
 
A: Paula Barbieri. 
 
Q: Now, the clothing that you took with you to Mr. Kardashian's 
house in Mr. Kardashian's car was contained in the black bag that 
we discussed yesterday? 
 
A: Yeah. And I think I might have taken another change. I'm not 
sure of that, but I seem to remember that before we went, that I put 
some clothes in a bag. 
 
Q: The same black bag? 
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q: A different bag? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So you remember now taking two bags-- 
 
A: I don't remember. It seems to me I don't know if they brought it 
the next day. It just seems to me I brought something to put on the 
next day. 
 
MR. BAKER: Just wait a second. 
 
And I object to the preamble of the question, "you remember now," 
because that's exactly what he testified to yesterday. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: How many bags did you take with you 
to Mr. Kardashian's car en route to his house? 
 
A: My black bag. 
 
Q: And do you remember any other luggage that you took with 
you? 
 
A: No, but I--I just seem to have a memory that I did bring some 
clothes with me, and I just don't recall if I carried a bag. I don't 
think I carried a bag. I think I just had my black bag, but it just 
seems to me that I carried a change of clothes. 
 
Q: Were all the clothes that you carried with you to Mr. 
Kardashian's house put in this black bag? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: You think you might have just set them in the car, you mean? 
 
A: Yeah, maybe I had a suit bag or something. I just don't recall. 
 
Q: And do you recall specifically-- Withdrawn. You said yesterday 
you think some other clothes may have been delivered to you while 
you were there. 
 
A: I know they were. 
 
Q: And were they delivered in a suitcase? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Okay. When you went into the Bronco on the 17th, Mr. 
Cowlings' Bronco, you testified yesterday that you took the black 
bag with you. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you remember if it had any clothes in it? 
 
A: If it did, whatever was in there from when I got there Monday: 
Socks, maybe underwear, something. 
 
Q: And you were taking out some of those socks and underwear 
during the course of the week. Right? 
 
A: No, I don't recall that. I think they brought me clothes. I think 
from my house they brought me a lot of stuff. 
 
Q: so whatever socks and underwear were in the black bag when 
you arrived at Kardashian's remained in the bag and were in the 
bag when you took it into the Bronco. Is that right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Did you take any other clothes with you, other than what might 
have been in the black bag, when you went into Mr. Cowlings' 
Bronco? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have him do so? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were there any other clothes in the Bronco? 
 
A: I didn't look around really to see. They weren't mine if they 
were. 
 
Q: When we were off the record, we distributed copies of exhibits 
4A,-B, -C and -D and 1201 Exhibit 5 that we referred to yesterday 
on the record. 
 
I now would like to show you a photograph -three photographs, 
which we will mark as the next exhibit in order, which will be 7, 
and we will mark it 7-A, -B and -C, and I will show you the 
original photographs that we have, and I will distribute Xerox 
copies of these to counsel. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 7 (A C) was marked for identification by the 
reporter and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson, looking at the photos which we've marked as 
Exhibit 7 collectively, do you recognize what is depicted in the 
photos? 
 
A. Yes. 
 
Q: What is it? 
 
A: A type of cell phone. 
 
Q: Was this the cell phone that you owned and used in June of 
1994? 
 
A: It could be. 
 
Q: Do you recognize the telephone number 613-3232? 
 
A: I believe that was my number. 
 
Q: And yesterday you--Withdrawn 
 
Is this the cell phone that was in the black bag that you took with 
you to Chicago? 
 
A: If this is mine, yes. 
 
Q: Do you have any reason to believe it's not yours? 
 
A: Well, I know that--No, I don't. 
 
Q: Does it look like yours? 
 
A: The type that I use, yes. 
 
Q: And does this cell phone appear to be the one that you would 
have mounted in the Bronco or mounted in the Bentley when you 
drove in the car? 
 
A: Yeah, it was this type of form, yes. 
 
Q: And you were able to use it outside of the automobiles as well. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you said it had a battery pack that was attached to it when 
you used it outside of the car. Is that correct? 
 
A: And inside of the car. 
 
Q: And inside of the car. Do you see the battery pack there, by the 
way? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is it clear to you then that neither of the two battery packs that 
you mentioned yesterday appears in these photographs? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: Do you know where those battery packs are? 
 
A: I would imagine in A.C.'s Bronco. 
 
Q: Did you remove the battery pack from the cell phone at anytime 
while you were driving in Mr. Cowlings' Bronco? 
 
A: I removed numerous battery packs from mine, I guess A.C.'s. I 
think the police officers gave us a few of them, yes. 
 
Q: And you were using additional battery packs on your cell 
phone? 
 
A: They kept giving them because the phone kept going dead, and 
I think the police officers were giving us battery packs, too, to get 
the phone alive again. 
 
Q: Okay. In June of 1994, how many telephones did you have in 
Rockingham? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: How many telephone lines did you have? 
 
A: One, two. I know I had a rotary phone. 
 
Q: You had phones in various rooms throughout the house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Were they all operable? 
 
A: I would imagine so. 
 
Q: How did the police, by the way, provide you with battery packs 
while you were in the Bronco? 
 
A: Through A.C. I'm sure it's all in-police have that all. I guess 
A.C. was going back and forth, and I was in my driveway and-- 
 
Q: While you were at Rockingham? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you have a recollection that you were out in that Bronco 
about eight hours on the 17th of June? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you estimate how long you were out in the Bronco? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't have a clear recollection of those events? 
 
A: No. Not time-wise, no. 
 
Q: Did you take any Xanax? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever taken Xanax? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: You don't have to answer that. You answered that 
yesterday. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Are you under any medication today? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Which medication? 
 
A: Sulfasalazine and Motrin. 
 
Q: Your blood was taken on June 13. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: From the police? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen a report from the LAPD that showed traces 
of marijuana in your blood? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are you aware that there is such a report? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:

A: Yes. 
 
Q: What is that information? 
 
A: She told me on one occasion, and people that I talked to that 
was in the intervention mentioned that it came up in the 
intervention. 
 
Q: What intervention? 
 
A: Intervention for Faye Resnick. 
 
Q: When did you first talk to anyone about that intervention? 
 
A: After--maybe when I was in jail, but I think more when I got 
out, but possibly when I was in jail. 
 
Q: Prior to the time you went to jail, you had not spoken to anyone 
about that intervention. Correct? 
 
A: Wrong. 
 
Q: Who did you speak to about it? 
 
A: I was told about it by Ron Fishman. And I talked to Christian 
Reichardt about it. 
 
Q: When did the intervention occur? 
 
A: I gather during the week of May 6--I mean June 6. 
 
Q: And was Nicole a part of the intervention? 
 
A: I believe she called it or she caused it to be caused--called. 
 
Q What was the purpose of the intervention? 
 
A: I gather Faye Resnick was a little out of control, and Nicole was 
concerned. 
 
Q: Nicole told you that she did this. Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: She didn't tell you that she had called the intervention? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that she participated in it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she ever discuss with you the intervention? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And how did you find out what you just said a moment ago? 
 
A: Originally, Ron Fishman told me. Then Christian Reichardt told 
me. 
 
Q: The conversations with Fishman and Reichardt occurred before 
Nicole's murder? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you heard about the intervention from Ron Fishman 
and Christian Reichardt, did you speak to Nicole about that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you speak to anyone about that? 
 
A: Other than the two of them. 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You said that Nicole told you that she had used some drugs, 
illegal drugs. When was that? 
 
A: In January. 
 
Q: Of what year? 
 
A: '94. 
 
Q: Was that the first time that she told you that? 
 
 A: That she was using it, well, yeah. I mean, would be concerned 
in '94. In '93 she told me, too, but we weren't together in '93. But in 
'94, she--something happened in '94, and she called me in New 
York and told me about it. 
 
Q: Let's just focus for now on 1994. When is the first time in 1994 
that she told you that she was using drugs? 
 
 A: Somewhere near the middle to end, I believe, of January. Could 
have been the beginning of February, but I think it was the middle 
or the end of January. 
 
 Q: What did she say to you? 
 
A: She called me. She was crying. 
 
Q: What did she say? 
 
A: She was in trouble. 
 
Q: What else did she say? 
 
A: She was in trouble. She did something she wasn't--she thought 
she was going to get in some trouble. She needed my help. 
 
Q: What did she say that she had done? 
 
MR. KELLY: I am going to object at this time. 
 
THE WITNESS: Thank you. 
 
MR. KELLY: I am going to ask to see you. I want to speak to you 
for a minute, Mr. Petrocelli.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Mr. Simpson, let me go back to the 
intervention that you described involving Faye Resnick. Okay? 
You said you spoke to Ron Fishman about it and Christian 
Reichardt. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Tell me what Fishman told you about the intervention. 
 
A: Told me that there was an intervention; did I hear, and I said no. 
And he described to me that they had evidently called an 
intervention, and there was a lot of people angry with one another. 
Faye was put into a center, rehab center and there was a lot of 
anger among the various people involved. 
 
Q: Did Fishman tell you this? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did he attend it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And how did he find this out? 
 
A: You would have to ask him. 
 
Q: Did he tell you how he knew? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you do anything about that information once you heard it? 
 
A: I--immediately, no. 
 
Q: At any time? 
 
A: Other than talk to Christian to see how he was faring about it, 
other than that, no. 
 
Q: Who is Christian Reichardt? 
 
A: He was--had some relationship with Faye Resnick. 
 
Q: And you spoke--you called him up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And after hearing from Fishman about the intervention? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And tell me what you and he discussed; that is, you and 
Reichardt. 
 
A: I asked how he was doing, and he told me he was hanging in 
there, and he sort of described what happened. 
 
Q: Was the subject of the intervention essentially Faye's problems? 
 
A: I'm sure the intervention was, yes. 
 
Q: Did you do anything after talking to Reichardt? 
 
A: What do you mean, did I do anything? 
 
MR. BAKER: Relative to the intervention? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: About the intervention. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was that the last time you discussed that before the time you 
were incarcerated, with anyone? 
 
A: I--as best I can recall, yes. 
 
Q: And you never discussed it with Nicole. Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, did you--in your conversation with Fishman, was there 
any discussion about Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Relate that discussion. 
 
A: That Christian and Nicole had an argument because of how, I 
guess, the intervention came across--came about. 
 
Q: You mean the way it was being handled? 
 
A: I guess so, yes. 
 
Q: And that was reported to you by Fishman. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was there anything else said about Nicole in your 
conversation with Fishman? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q Okay. And in your conversation with Reichardt, was there any 
discussion of Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what was that discussion? 
 
A: In part he was upset with her for not letting him know what had 
been going on. 
 
Q: With Faye? 
 
A: With Faye. And in part that she didn't call him, and the fact that 
they were letting it go, and I guess it was he who really forced the 
intervention at that point. 
 
Q: Christian? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did Christian tell you that was going on with Faye 
Resnick that he was upset with Nicole for not responding to 
sooner? 
 
A: That she was heavily involved in cocaine and was doing it in 
Nicole's presence regularly and that Nicole never alerted him to it. 
 
Q: Now, this is something that was told to you by Christian 
Reichardt? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: You didn't witness this yourself. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q You've never witnessed Faye Resnick taking cocaine. Correct? 
 
A: Cocaine, no. 
 
Q: In 1994 did you ever see Faye Resnick take any sort of illegal 
narcotic? 
 
A: Illegal? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: I would say I wouldn't know, so I don't know what's illegal or 
not. 
 
Q: Did you ever see her abuse drugs, witness her abusing drugs in 
the year 1994? 
 
A: I felt I did, yes. 
 
Q: You personally witnessed it? 
 
A: I felt I did, yes. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: In March. 
 
Q: Where was that? 
 
A: At a restaurant called Toscana. 
 
Q: Who?-- 
 
MR. KELLY: I'm sorry I can't hear. 
 
THE WITNESS: A restaurant called Toscana. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And who was present there? 
 
A: Nicole, Christian Reichardt and Faye. 
 
Q: And did you say anything to Faye about this? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:: What did you say? 
 
A: Told her she was out of line doing what she was doing and- 
 
Q: Referring to what? 
 
A: Taking all the pills she was taking and drinking. 
 
Q: And what did she say? 
 
A: She argued a little bit, but the other two people sided with me, 
and, you know, they took the pills from her. 
 
Q: Other than that incident, did you ever witness her in 1994 
abusing drugs in your presence? 
 
A: Not with my eyes, no. 
 
O Okay. Other than that incident and what Mr. Reichardt told you, 
did you ever obtain any other information in 1994 before Nicole's 
murder that Faye was abusing drugs? 
 
A: Other than comments Nicole made. 
 
O: Nicole would make comments to you from time to time about 
that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: To what effect? 
 
A: That she had drug problems and that she was a-- 
 
Q: "She" being whom? 
 
A: Faye Resnick. 
 
Q: And what was your reaction to that? 
 
A: It had nothing to do with me, and I really didn't spend that much 
time with Faye, so it wasn't a part of my life. It was her--you know, 
their problems, not mine. 
 
Q: I see. Do you know what the intervention consisted of, by the 
way? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Do you know the details of it? 
 
A: Other than what was told to me by Christian. no. 
 
Q: Do you know where it took place? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know what happened after the intervention-- 
 
A: When I got-- 
 
Q: --with Faye? 
 
A: From what I gather, Christian took her to some place. 
 
Q: Do you know where? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you ever see Faye there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or call her there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know what date Faye went there? 
 
A: I believe it was in the middle of the week of the week of the 6th. 
 
Q: June 6? 
 
A: Yeah, the middle of that week, sometime during that week. A 
few days before Nicole's death. 
 
Q: You did not speak to Faye Resnick at any time from the 
moment she went into the treatment center? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When was the last time that you spoke to her? 
 
A: Either Sunday or Monday of that week. That would have been 
whatever those dates were, Sunday and Monday preceding the 
12th. 
 
MR. BLAZER: Spoke to Faye, you mean? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
Q: Let me show you as the next exhibit in order a calendar marked 
as Exhibit-- 
 
MR. BAKER: 8? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:--8. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 8 was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
MR. BAKER: And what do you want him to look at particularly 
here? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: June. First of all, I want him to identify it. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, I will stipulate it's a 1994 Month At-A 
Glance. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I want to go over the calendar. 
 
MR. BAKER: I'm sorry. Go ahead. 
 
MR. KELLY: Do you have copies for everybody? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. KELLY: I'm sorry. 
 
MR. BREWER: What exactly is Exhibit 8? Has it been identified? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: I have before you--I'm getting copies 
circulated. I have before you what we have marked as Exhibit 8. 
Do you recognize this document? 
 
A: It depicts a calendar. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: It depicts portions of a calendar, I believe. 
 
Q: Now, is this your calendar? 
 
A: I think it does--I think it is a cop-I believe so. yes. It's not my 
calendar, but it's somehow, I guess, if I put it together, it would be-
- 
 
Q: Right. You have to put the two pages together where the spirals 
are. That's how it was Xeroxed. Do you see that? 
 
A: Yeah. Yeah, I think it is mine. 
 
Q: Now, this is a calendar that you maintained yourself? 
 
A: I never really had a calendar, no. Cathy would fax me a page or, 
you know, whatever was coming up, she 'd send me a page with 
what's on it, and that was it. So I never had a calendar. 
 
Q: You didn't carry a calendar like sort of like this one, Month At-
A Glance-- 
 
A: No. 
 
a --in your bag with you, right-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:--or on your person? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And Cathy Randa would maintain your calendar? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Is any of the handwriting on here your handwriting? If you take 
a look at the page for June, for example. 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: And do you know whose handwriting is on there? 
 
A: I believe it's Cathy's. 
 
Q: There seems to be different handwriting on these pages. 
 
MR. BAKER: I am not sure it's different handwriting. It's different 
pens. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you recognize all of the handwriting on June of 1994 as that 
of Cathy Randa? 
 
MR. BAKER: This is the page he s looking at-- 
 
THE Witness: That's part of June That's part of June. 
 
MR. BAKER: Oh, sure it is. I'm sorry. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't even recognize it as Cathy's. I'm just 
assuming, it's Cathy's. I wouldn't recognize Cathy's handwriting if 
you wrote it down and showed it to me. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: You wouldn't recognize her 
handwriting? 
 
A: No. I never paid attention to her handwriting. 
 
Q: But none of this is your handwriting. Is that right? 
 
A: I don't believe so, no. 
 
Q Did you maintain any other kind of appointment book or 
calendar yourself, like one of those computerized or any kind, for 
that matter? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nothing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So any time you needed to know what your appointments were, 
Cathy would send you something. Is that right? 
 
A: Well, normally. She always in my travel folder or whatever 
would have whatever I got to do that week or whatever my month 
looked like, yeah. 
 
Q: Did you maintain a calendar at home? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: In your office or anywhere? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. Now going back to the calendar for June, okay, and 
looking at it, can you tell me what's the last day that you spoke to 
Faye Resnick? 
 
A: It was either Monday or--Sunday or Monday, the 5th or the 6th. 
One of those days. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: Of June. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you recall what the purpose of that call was? 
 
A: It wasn't a call. 
 
Q: You met with her? 
 
A: No. She was at Nicole's house. 
 
Q: And that's before the intervention, to the best of your 
knowledge. Right? 
 
A: Yes. Yeah, it was definitely before the intervention. 
 
Q: So you were at Nicole's house what day, now? 
 
A: Either Sunday or Monday. 
 
Q: Now we are talking June 5 or June 6. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: In Nicole's house, you mean 875 Bundy. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who else was there? 
 
A: I don't--Justin may have been with me, and I didn't go in the 
house, so--well, no, I didn't go in the house that day, so I don't 
know who was in the house. 
 
Q: So you stayed outside? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: In the front. 
 
Q: Front of the house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: By the way, is there a buzzer at the front that you could ring the 
doorbell? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was that operable? 
 
A: As far as I knew, yes. 
 
Q: And was there one in the back? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: There was no buzzer in the back? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could you enter the back? 
 
A: If they opened the garage, you could. 
 
Q: And was there a back--another back entrance besides the 
garage? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Was there a back gate, for example? 
 
A: What do you mean? To the property? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did that have a buzzer? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How would you get in through the back gate if you wanted to? 
 
A: Somebody would have to open it. 
 
Q: Was it locked? 
 
A: I would think so, yes. 
 
Q: So if you came in through the back gate, you couldn't get in 
unless you had a key? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And on the front gate, you would have to buzz somebody. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then-- 
 
A: Or have a key. 
 
Q: Or have a key. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And then there was the garage in the back. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And on this occasion did you buzz to gain entry to the property? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you come alone? 
 
A: I may have been with Justin. 
 
Q: What was your purpose in going there? 
 
A: Get the dogs. 
 
Q: What dogs? 
 
A: Actually, get Chachi. 
 
Q: That's your dog? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then take the dog back in the car and leave. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you buzzed the buzzer in the front there, is there like a 
voice box where you can talk and be heard? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you identified yourself? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: They just buzzed, and you opened the door and went through? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Tell me what happened. 
 
A: I buzzed and Faye came out. 
 
Q: She came all the way out to the front gate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Opened it up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you and Justin went in? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Justin stayed in the car? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Tell me what happened. 
 
A: The dog ran out. 
 
Q: Out of the gate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And ran where? 
 
A: Off. 
 
Q: What did you do? 
 
A: I went one way and Faye went up Bundy, and I went one way, 
and then I drove back--I mean I walked back. got in my car and 
started driving and caught the dog in the alley across on the other 
side of Bundy in an alley and then brought the dog back to the 
front of the house. 
 
Q: What did you do then? 
 
A: I got the dog back on her property. 
 
Q: How did you do that? 
 
A: Grabbed it and brought it, you know, back on the property. 
 
Q: And where did you bring the dog? 
 
A: To the--inside the front gate. 
 
Q: Who did you give the dog to? 
 
A: Nobody. 
 
Q: When you went inside the front gate, was it open? 
 
A: Yes. It wasn't closed, yes. 
 
Q: So you could push it open without a key? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you entered the property? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q And with the dog? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you do when you entered the property? 
 
A: The dog ran, and I went looking for the other dog. 
 
Q: Did you find the dog? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: Down below the side of her house. 
 
Q: You mean the side of the alleyway? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you walked down that alleyway, and did you go down the 
stairs? 
 
A: I believe so. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: Saw the dog--How far did you go down the alley? 
 
A: I don't--I'm not sure. 
 
Q: What did you do then? 
 
A: I got the dog and kinda shooed it to come with me. 
 
Q: And then what did you do? 
 
A: Walked the dog back to the front gate. 
 
Q: And then what? 
 
A: Faye was at the front gate at that point in time, and I got the dog 
to the truck and put him in and left. 
 
Q: Did you spend time talking to Faye at the front gate? 
 
A: Faye was talked--babbling. Faye was, in my judgment, totally 
plastered. So she was babbling, yes. 
 
Q: What was she saying? 
 
A: I couldn't even tell you. Didn't make any sense to me. 
 
Q: She wasn't coherent to you. Is that what you're saying.7 
 
A: In my opinion, no.  
 
Q: Did you spend time trying to talk to her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you do anything to--Were you concerned at all for her 
safety? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You got the dog and then went back in the car? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you talk to anyone else on that occasion? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: For example, did you talk to Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know if she was home? 
 
A: I thought I saw her at the door when I came back with the dog. I 
think she was standing in the doorway. 
 
Q: Front doorway? 
 
A: I believe so. I'm not sure. She could have been up on the 
balcony looking down. 
 
Q: And you said nothing to her? 
 
A: No, because I just saw her as I was coming, you know, driving 
up, and then she wasn't there. I believe. Other than, "Hey, the dog 
got out," or something maybe, but nothing relevant to anything. 
 
Q: Did you gesture or wave to her? 
 
A: Possible. I don't know. I mean, we acknowledged each other, 
but, you know... 
 
Q: You can't recall any conversation of substance-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:--of any kind with Faye Resnick. Is that right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was that the last time you were at the Bundy property before 
Nicole's death? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Were you bleeding on that occasion? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Did you have any cuts that you knew of? 
 
A: Not that I was aware of. 
 
Q: Were you wearing any Band-Aids? 
 
A: Not that I was aware of. 
 
Q: When you were looking for the dog, what is the other dog you 
were looking for? 
 
A: I was going to get Chachi and Kato, a dog called Kato is the one 
that got out. 
 
Q: The dog that got out onto Bundy 
 
A: Kato. 
 
Q:--was Kato. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you put that dog in the Bronco. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What car were you driving? 
 
A: Bronco. 
 
Q; Bronco. You first got--you retrieved Kato. Is that what you're 
saying? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you do with Kato when you retrieved him? 
 
A: As I said, I put him back on the property. 
 
Q: On the property. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you went and got Chachi. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you went and got Chachi, you said you walked a little bit 
down the property. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you go all the way down to the back gate? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: What is your best recollection? 
 
A: I don't have a best recollection. It's something I do often. 
 
Q: What is that? 
 
A: Pick up the dogs. And this one didn't stand out any more than 
any other time. 
 
MR. KELLY: I'm sorry, Mr. Simpson. I can't hear you. 
 
MR. BAKER: There was no question, anyway. 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, he was talking. I couldn't hear him. 
 
MR. BAKER: I understand. 
 
MR. KELLY: Okay. 
 
MR. BAKER: But, you know, if he wants to give a monologue 
against his lawyer's advice... 
 
MR. KELLY: Well, I especially want to hear things against his 
lawyer's advice. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: We have marked that calendar as Exhibit 8, and while we are on 
the subject of calendars, I am going to show you another calendar. 
which we will mark as Exhibit 9. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 9 was marked for identification by the reporter 
1 and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Take a look at what we have marked as Exhibit 9. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Can you tell me if this appears to be a copy of a calendar for 
you for the year 1994? 
 
A: Yes, it appears to be. 
 
Q: Is this a calendar that you maintained? 
 
A: As I told you before, I didn't maintain any calendar. 
 
Q: Do you recognize the handwriting? 
 
A: Yeah. Pretty much looks like what is normally on my calendars. 
 
Q: To the best of your knowledge, do you think this calendar was 
one that was maintained by Cathy Randa? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: This calendar is different from the Exhibit 8 calendar. There are 
different entries for the various dates. Do you know why that is? 
 
A: I can only surmise. 
 
Q What is your best understanding of that? 
 
A: That normally this would be-looks more like what she would 
have printed to send to me. The other one looked more like 
something that she would maintain herself. Because I wouldn't 
want to see all that other stuff that's on the calendar. 
 
Q: Exhibit 9 appears to be a copy of the kind of information that 
she would transmit to you. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah. She did this page, and if I was taking some trips this 
week, she would put this in my travel folder, just copy a page like 
this and put it in my travel folder. 
 
Q: So you would take a copy of the page with the days involved in 
your travel. Correct? 
 
A: Virtually, yes. 
 
Q; Literally a Xerox copy? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you put it in that black bag we discussed yesterday? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What do you call that again? 
 
A: My grip. 
 
Q: Your grip. Okay. Are you aware of any other calendars that 
were maintained for you other than these two 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:--for the year 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Are you aware of whether Cathy Randa shredded any 
documents in 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know if she did? 
 
A: l hope so. 
 
Q: You told her to? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why do you say you hope so? 
 
A: At one point once the trial began, everybody, all the lawyers, 
were given shredders, and I believe Marcia Clark also talked in 
court that they were all shredding everything, and all our lawyers 
were shredding everything because the media was going through 
the garbage cans to get story material. So it was discussed in the 
courtroom at one point. 
 
Q: It was discussed in the courtroom that documents should be 
shredded? 
 
A: No. That you should shred all garbage and all stuff once you 
looked at it or whatever. You shredded it and got rid of it. And I 
believe the prosecution said they were doing the same thing. 
 
Q: You are referring to documents generated in the course of the 
case, you mean? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What about documents at the Brentwood office where Cathy 
Randa worked? 
 
A: What about it? 
 
Q: Do you know whether she ever shredded any documents there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever tell her to do so? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Has anyone ever told you that she did so? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever acquired any information that Randa shredded 
any documents after-- 
 
A: What do you mean by "documents"? 
 
Garbage? 
 
Q: No, not things already thrown away. Things that were in your 
desks or your drawers or cabinets. 
 
A: I think I saw where things were being shredded In our office, 
yes. 
 
Q: How did you see that? 
 
A: They were talking about it in court. 
 
Q: Who was talking? 
 
A: I don't know. lt. was an issue in court one day. 
 
Q: Did you discuss that issue with Cathy Randa? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell your lawyers what to tell Cathy to shred? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know what Cathy shredded? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether she shredded any documents relating to 
Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't know one way or the other? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether she shredded any documents relating to 
the l989 incident involving spousal abuse? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know anything about that one way or the other? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether she destroyed any documents? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Cathy Randa shredded any documents 
that the prosecutors had subpoenaed and requested to be produced 
in court? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether anyone told her to do so? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Before you were incarcerated, did you destroy any documents? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or ask other people to dispose of, discard or shred any 
documents? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: After you were incarcerated, did you ask anybody to see that 
certain documents or materials were destroyed, discarded or 
shredded? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether that occurred? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Looking at your calendar again, Exhibit 8, let's say-- 
 
A: Which one? 
 
Q: Take a look at Exhibit 8. It's also-you could look at the trial 
exhibit number for the criminal case. It was Exhibit 599. Just make 
sure you have the right one. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: And look at June again or May. May and June. Can you tell me, 
prior to--Well, let me back Up. 
 
The occasion that you described where you retrieved the dogs, 
when did that occur; on June 5 or June 6? 
 
A: I'm not sure. 
 
Q: What is your best understanding? 
 
A: I don't have one. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: I don't have one. 
 
Q: It's one of those two days? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What time of day? 
 
A: Afternoon. 
 
Q: And what was the total amount of time that you believe you 
were on the Bundy property on that occasion? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Less than a minute? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Less than five minutes? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when was the time before that occasion when you were last 
at the Bundy property? 
 
A: In the Bundy--in Bundy? 
 
Q: Yes. On the property or in the house. 
 
A: June 4th. 
 
Q: And prior to June 4th? 
 
THE WITNESS: I can't tear this thing? 
 
MR. BAKER: Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's the court exhibit. Why don't you--I will 
try to fix that at a break. 
 
THE WITNESS: We're talking on the property? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yeah, last time before June 4. 
 
A: I was definitely there on June 22nd and 23rd-- 
 
MR. BAKER: May? 
 
THE WITNESS: I mean May 22nd and May 23rd, and-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Both days? 
 
A: Yeah, pretty sure both days, and possibly... I can't really recall. 
Possibly another time during the course of that week. Just briefly, 
yes. 
 
Q: What happened on June 4 that caused you to be on the 
property? 
 
A: I had to look at my son's Nintendo setup. 
 
Q: That was in the house? 
 
A: Yeah. Q: And how did you access the property on that 
occasion? 
 
A: I came. I blew the horn. Justin was with me. I blew the horn, 
Nicole opened the garage, and we came up through the garage, 
went to his room looked at his setup and went back down the stairs 
and went back out the garage and left. 
 
Q: You drove up to the back of the property? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Right in front of the garage? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And the garage door is closed? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: You blew the horn, and the garage door went up? 
 
A: Yeah 
 
Q: And then you went in? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And how long were you there? 
 
A: Whatever time it took to walk up the stairs, whatever it took, 
about a minute or two maximum to see the hookup, and then walk 
back down the stairs. Five minutes or less. 
 
Q: Now, the stairs that we're referring to are the stairs that lead 
from the inside of the garage up into the home. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: we are talking about interior stairs. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Then when you got into the first level of the home, you then 
went upstairs using interior stairs to the bedroom-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:--of your son. correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you fixed the Nintendo setup for him-- 
 
A: I didn't fix it. I needed to see the hookup and how it was 
arranged and everything. 
 
Q: Did you buy him a Nintendo cartridge around that time? 
 
A: I bought him one later, and I had already bought him one -
whatever the other game is. There's another one like Nintendo. 
 
Q: Sega? 
 
A: Sega or something, and we were trying to set it up in his room. 
 
Q: Do you remember the name of the game you bought him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And then you came--After you checked out the setup-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:--what did you then do? 
 
A: Went and got in my car. 
 
Q: Came right back down the stairs same way you came up? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Went out the garage and into the car. Is that right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And drove off. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you converse with Nicole that occasion? 
 
A: On the 4th, no. 
 
Q: Was she there? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you see her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How do you know she was home? 
 
A: Jason--Justin ran in her room, and she was in bed and they were 
talking, and you have to go by the door of her room, and I heard 
them talking as I went to his room. You have to walk by her room 
to get to his room. 
 
Q: Justin came with you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then he left with you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was there anybody else home with Nicole? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: And you didn't speak to Nicole at all? 
 
A: No. Well, somebody may have been home with Nicole, because 
I saw Faye's car, but I don't know if Faye was there. 
 
Q: You recognized her car? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Where was it parked? 
 
A: In the back. 
 
Q: What kind of car was it? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't recall. 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: I don't remember, but I know it was her car. 
 
Q: Nicole then had two cars. Is that right? 
 
A: I believe so, yeah. 
 
Q: What were they? 
 
A: A Ferrari and a truck. 
 
Q: Were they both in the garage? 
 
A: I don't recall. I don't think so. 
 
Q: Were they parked there on the property? 
 
A: I don't think so because I was able to pull right up to the garage, 
so one of them must not have been there. 
 
Q: Is that where one usually -where she usually parked one of 
them? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where? Outside the garage door? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Which one was that? 
 
A: The jeep. 
 
Q: And the other car, the Ferrari, was always parked in the garage? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you used to arrive, would you literally turn into the 
driveway or just park parallel to it? 
 
A: Turn into it. 
 
Q: Turn into it? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So you would park next to the other jeep. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. You couldn't park parallel. You'd block the alley. 
 
Q: Now, the last time before June 4 you were at the Bundy 
property you said was definitely when? 
 
A: Well, I was definitely there the 22nd and 23rd-- 
 
Q: 22nd and 23rd? 
 
A: Of May, yes, and I believe I could have been there one time 
during that week. 
 
Q: What did you do there on the 22nd and 23rd? 
 
A: 22nd I helped Nicole with something, and we talked, and 23rd I 
think I had dinner with her. 
 
Q: Let's start with the 23rd. Tell me about that occasion. 
 
A: Nicole needed -I think she needed some cough syrup, and the 
kids were with me and she called-I believe she called. She went 
home. I checked on her, and she needed some cough syrup or 
something, and I went over and we talked. We talked about a few 
things. 
 
Q: Did you go over there alone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And parked in the same place in the back? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Which car did you drive? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: And how did you get into the house? 
 
A: Either I blew, if I was in the back, and she answered or she 
buzzed me in the front. I just don't recall. 
 
Q: You don't remember which way? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: Was it your practice to drive to the front of the house or the 
back of the house? 
 
A: I did both, depending on--normally depended on where I was 
coming from. If I was coming from home, normally I went to the 
back. So, you know. So more than likely it was the back, but I 
don't recall how I entered the house that time. 
 
Q: And if it was the back, that's the way you would go up. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And if it was the front, you would be let in through the front 
gate, and then you would go right to the front door. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, that front door is situated on the property prior to those 
steps going down the alleyway. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So in order to go from the gate to the front door, you don't have 
to walk down the alleyway and go down the steps and go back up 
again. Correct? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: Is there any other entrance to the property besides--to the home 
besides that garage in the back and the front door that you just 
described? 
 
MR. BAKER: The back gate you were talking about? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me start all over again. 
 
Q: Is there any other entrance to the Bundy home of Nicole other 
than the garage and the front door that you just described? 
 
MR. BAKER: You mean actually to get into the--physically inside 
the house? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: Okay. 
 
THE witness: I don't know if you can--there's a room down there. I 
don't know if you can--I don't know if it needs a key to get into, but 
there is a room that is down on that walkway, but I'm not sure if 
there's--if it's-if it can he used as an entrance. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You are now talking about the walkway, meaning that side 
alley. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you are saying that if you come down that side alley, there 
is a door? 
 
A: There is a room, and I know you come out of that room. I just 
don't know if it's a room that you can get into if it's locked. I don't 
know. 
 
Q: If you were inside the property, you could come out of that 
room by going out a door to the side alley? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: I see. And what is that room. 
 
A: I think she used it as a maid's room. 
 
Q: Maid's room. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And it had a door that opened out into the side alley? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Is that a door that you ever used? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never went in or out that door? 
 
A: Never went in or out of that room. 
 
Q: Never was in that room? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How do you know about it? 
 
A: I know it's there. You can't come in from the garage without 
seeing the room there. 
 
Q: How do you know that it has a door on the other side that goes 
w the side alley? 
 
A: Because I've been in the alley with the dogs. 
 
Q: And you've seen that door? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you can look--Does the door have a window? 
 
A: I think it's a glass door. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: You can see right into the room.7 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Are there any other ways of accessing the home? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Is there more than-- 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Is there more than one front door? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Did you have any keys m the property? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Are you unsure of yourself? 
 
MR. BREWER: Well, I am going on object. Vague as to time also. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: In May of 1994--  A: I'm sorry. I didn't hear. 
 
Q:-did you have any keys to Nicole's property? 
 
A: None that I knew were Nicole's keys. 
 
Q: In June of 1994 did you have any keys? 
 
A: None that I knew of. 
 
Q: When you say that you did not have keys of Nicole's that you 
knew of, do you have a belief that you had some keys that might 
have been hers but you are not sure? 
 
A: No, I don't know if--I have no knowledge of having any keys to 
Nicole's house. 
 
Q: At any time? 
 
A: Well, yes, at some time, yes. 
 
Q: At any time in 1994 did you have any keys to Nicole's house on 
Bundy? 
 
A: Not that were my keys, no, but I've had in my possession the 
keys to her house in '94. 
 
Q: I see. And when was that? 
 
A: Numerous times. 
 
Q: Why would you have possession of keys to Nicole's house? 
 
A: Because I stayed at her house a lot, and some nights when I 
would either walk the dog or run to the store to get something, I'd 
go out the front door, and I'd use the key to get back in the front 
door. 
 
Q Where would you get that key? 
 
A: From her. 
 
Q: You would ask her? 
 
A: I'd just grab her key. 
 
Q: Was there a place where you would find the key? 
 
A: I don't recall. Normally she keeps her key on the counter, I 
believe, the counter in the kitchen. 
 
Q: And that key on the counter in the kitchen is the only key that 
you would have possession of from time to time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is it a single key? 
 
A: No. I think it was always a group of keys. 
 
Q: What were they keys to? 
 
A: Her car, her house, whatever. 
 
Q: Which keys would you use to access what locks on what doors? 
 
A: As far as I knew, it was one key that accessed the gate and the 
front door. 
 
Q: Same key? 
 
A: As far as I knew, yes. 
 
Q: Worked for both the gate and the front door? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Which gate are you referring to? 
 
A: In the front of the house. 
 
Q: And that's a key that you can specifically recall using to enter 
the front gate and the front door? 
 
A: And the exit also, yeah. 
 
Q: And the exit? 
 
A: And to exit. 
 
Q: To lock it behind you? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: I see. When was the last time you had that key? 
 
A: I don't know if I took it--her keys on the--the week of--the week 
she had pneumonia, so it would be the week of the 16th I may 
have, because I left her house to go get her some cough syrup at 
Westward Ho, and I went out the front door and to lock the front 
door. I may have then. 
 
Q: If you used it on the 16th-- 
 
A: No. The week of the 16th, sometime during the week. 
 
O: Did you then return it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you return it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: After the time you used the key to go get the cough syrup-- 
 
Is that what you said? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:--you never had possession of Nicole's keys? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That was the absolute last time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you remember whether that key had a key ring? 
 
A: No. I think it was a bunch of keys 
 
MR. KELLY: Dan, I am going to ask, can we take a five-minute 
break? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. This is a good time. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:38. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 11:00 o'clock. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Going back to your prior testimony about visiting Bundy on the 
22nd and the 23rd, the day that you went and took care of the 
Nintendo setup was which day, when you went up through the 
garage into the house? 
 
A: I believe that was the 4th. 
 
Q: That was the 4th. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Of June. Correct? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: And the 23rd, tell me again what you did then.

Q: Yes, May 23rd. 
 
A: I think I had dinner with them, with Sydney and Justin and her. 
 
Q: Sydney and Justin were at the house? 
 
A: On the 23rd, if that's a Monday, yes. 
 
Q: And you went there and had dinner? 
 
A: Yeah, I believe so.

A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Where did you park? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: How did you get into the property? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you blow the horn? Did you-- 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you buzz? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: You have no idea? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether you went in through the garage or some 
other way? 
 
A: The only other way would have been the front door, and I don't 
recall either. 
 
Q: When you went into the house, you had dinner there. Did you 
spend the night? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You came back. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Were you bleeding on that occasion? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: And you didn't have any cuts or anything Like that. Right? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: Did you have any Band-Aids or anything like that? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: When you say not that you recall, is there any doubt in your 
mind? 
 
A: I don'trecall. If you go prior to the 23rd, I can't tell you any time 
in my life I ever bled, but I know I have. 
 
Q: You can't remember. Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Yeah. Yes. 
 
Q: Now, on the 22nd, what was that occasion when you visited the 
condo at Bundy? 
 
A: Nicole had left my house feeling weak, and I had the kids. She 
told me she wanted to talk to me. So at some time later on that day 
I--that night we-or that afternoon or whatever, I went to her house. 
I think I brought her some food, too. 
 
Q: Which car did you drive? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Where did you park? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: How did you get into the property? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Would it have been through the front gate or the garage? 
 
A: Yes. Q: And you spent--How long did you spend there with 
Nicole? 
 
A: We're talking the 2-- 
 
Q: --2nd. 
 
A: I would say an hour or two. That's a guess. That's an estimate. 
 
Q: Was anyone else home besides the two of you? 
 
A: I believe the kids. 
 
Q: The same true on the 23rd; just you, Nicole and the kids. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: By the "kids"-- 
 
A: I don't know. Housekeeper might have been there that day on 
the 23rd. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: Her name is? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Were you bleeding on the 22nd there? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: Did you have any cuts? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: Now go to--When was the last time before the 22nd you were 
there? You said the week of the 16th. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: We are in May, of course. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: You described an occasion when you went to go get some 
cough medicine? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Nicole was sick? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: She was in bed? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when did you first go to her house-What day was that 
during the week of the 16th of May? 
 
A: I don't know. I was there almost --when I was in town that 
week, I was there each day. 
 
Q: You went there a number of days? 
 
A: That week, yes. 
 
Q: How did you get there? 
 
A: I'm sure I drove. 
 
Q: Which car? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Where did you park? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You have no recollection where you parked? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q Was-- 
 
A: The front or the back. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: Front or the back of the house. 
 
Q: If you were going to be there an extended !181 period of time, 
would you typically park in the back? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And when you--So whenever you entered the house on those 
various days, you would have entered through the garage or the 
front gate. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you went through the front gate, you would go directly 
from the front gate to the front door. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. Unless the dogs were there and I was dicking around with 
the dogs. 
 
Q: Do you remember doing so? 
 
A: I've done it many times. 
 
Q: Did you do so that week? 
 
A: I'm sure I did. 
 
Q: Were you bleeding at all at the property during the week of May 
16th? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: Did you have any cuts? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: When you entered through the front, you would park on Bundy. 
Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, during that week did you make various trips and errands 
for Nicole to get her things? 
 
MR. BAKER: During what week are we talking about? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: During the week of May 16 when she was ill, you identified one 
time when you were there, then left to bring her some cough 
medicine and came back. 
 
Right? 
 
A: Yeah. Yeah. 
 
Q: Were there any other occasions during that week when you 
were visiting Nicole where you were there, left and then came 
back? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Do you have a specific recollection of any? 
 
A: I know I bought the kids dinner at least one night that week and 
went to probably Rosti to get it, so obviously I'm pretty sure that I 
did at least one time that week go to Rosti to get it and came back. 
 
Q: You were already at Nicole's place and-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:--then left-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:--and came back? 
 
A: I'm pretty sure. 
 
Q: How would you get back into the property when you returned to 
the property to get back in? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you have a key? 
 
A: She may have given me a key one of those times. May have, but 
I don't recall. 
 
Q: You don't recall. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you know any other person. other than Nicole, who in May 
or June of 1994 had keys to her apartment?  A: Firsthand, no, but I 
think Cora did. 
 
Q: When you say, "Firsthand, no," what does that mean? 
 
A: I never saw her hand a key to anyone else. 
 
Q: What makes you believe that Cora may have had a key? 
 
A: Because I believe when we were on a trip--I know she had a key 
to Cora's house, and when we were on a trip, couple of trips we 
were on, I believe Cora was--had a key to her house. It just seems 
to me that she had mentioned that Cora had a key to her house for 
something. 
 
Q: You didn't see the key. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you never got the key from Cora. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you've never seen Cora take possession or hold or use the 
key. Right? 
 
A: No. I've been in Nicole's house when Cora's come in, but 
actually that was on Gretna Green. I've been in her house upstairs 
with Nicole in the shower, Nicole's in the shower, I'm in the 
shower, and Cora's come in the house, so I assume she had a key. 
 
Q: Just an assumption on your part? 
 
A: Yes. Yes. And I'm pretty sure I've heard her say that Cora had a 
key. 
 
Q: You're pretty sure you heard who say? 
 
A: Nicole state that Cora's had a key. 
 
Q: When did she tell you that? 
 
A: I don't know. During the course of the year or so we were back 
together. 
 
Q: Did you question why Cora had a key? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you don't know of anybody else who had a key to Nicole's 
Bundy condo. Is that correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That's correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: After Nicole's death, you never got a key to her condo. Correct? 
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q: Is that correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you don't know of anybody else who received the key to 
the condo after Nicole's death. Correct? 
 
A: No, that's not correct. 
 
Q: What do you know in that regard? 
 
A: I know A.C. got a key. 
 
Q: When did A.C. get a key? 
 
A: I don't know. There was some things that they were trying to 
move, and he got a key from the Browns. 
 
Q: The Browns gave A.C. a key? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did that occur? 
 
A: I don't know. Sometime in June. 
 
Q: After Nicole's death? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How do you know that? 
 
A: I just remember they were talking about getting something--
helping move, is what I think it had to do, helping to move some 
things, and I believe--or maybe it was getting something for-might 
have had something to do with getting some clothes for Nicole or 
getting something for the kids that week, but I'm pretty sure A.C. 
had access to the house. 
 
Q: Are you telling me that--This is a -This is access--Withdrawn. 
 
You are saying that A.C. got a key to Nicole's condo-- 
 
A: Got access. I think a better word would be "access." 
 
Q: What does "access" mean? 
 
A: The ability to get in. 
 
Q: How do you know that? 
 
A: Because there was some conversation about it. 
 
Q: You were present? 
 
A: I just heard it being spoken about. 
 
Q: You heard who speaking about it? 
 
A: I believe it was A.C. and maybe Lou Brown. 
 
Q: When were you in the presence of A.C. and Lou Brown? 
 
A: At the wake I was in the presence of Lou Brown and at the 
funeral in the presence of Lou Brown, I think on the phone a few 
times speaking to Lou Brown, and A.C. I believe was in and out 
and around. 
 
He was running errands, bringing my kids to me, bringing the kids 
back to Laguna, doing various things. 
 
Q: Were you ever in a conversation with Lou Brown and A.C. 
Cowlings when the subject of access to Nicole's condo came up? 
 
A: I believe. yes. l believe it was the subject of getting something 
from Nicole's house, and I believe I was, yes, but I can't-I don't 
have a specific memory. 
 
Q: Where was that conversation? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What exactly was said? 
 
A: I told you I don't have a specific memory. 
 
Q: What was said at all about access? 
 
A: I just recall A.C. was supposedly helping the Browns get 
something or move something from Nicole's house. 
 
Q: But you don't know that A.C. actually received a key to the 
condo. Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you have never seen A.C. Cowlings possess a key to 
Nicole's condo. Correct? 
 
A: No. That's correct. 
 
a That's correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So other than this conversation that you may have--or whatever 
you heard in this conversation, you are not aware of anybody else 
getting a key to Nicole's condo after her death. Correct? 
 
A: Access, keys--access, I think Ron Hardy's someone -I don't 
know firsthand. You're right. I don't know firsthand. 
 
a You don't know that anybody actually got a key to the condo. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Including Cowlings. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Did you ever use a key to Nicole's condo to the back gate? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether you even needed a key? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't know? 
 
A: I don't know. I know it locks. 
 
Q: But you don't know whether you need a key to get in or out? 
 
A: I've never looked at it and see if you need a key. I never thought 
about it, no. 
 
Q: Can you estimate for me how many times you went to Nicole's 
property on the 16th of May when she was ill? 
 
MR. LEONARD: On the 16th? MR. PETROCELLI: The week of 
the 16th. 
 
MR. BAKER: I thought we talked about-- 
 
Go ahead. You can answer, O.J., if you have an estimate. 
 
THE WITNESS: I think pretty sure on the 17th I did. I don't know 
if I went on the 16th at all. I may not even have been in town on 
the 16th. I'm pretty sure on the 17th, 18th and 19th I did probably 
twice each day. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: On those occasions Nicole was ill with a pneumonia? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she was confined to bed? 
 
A: Well, not really, but for the most part, yeah. 
 
Q: For the most part she was in bed? 
 
A: Whenever I saw her, she was in bed a few times and she was 
out of bed a few times. 
 
Q: Where is her bedroom. 
 
A: On the third floor, depending on which side of the property 
you're entering from. 
 
Q: That's the top floor? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And the front door accesses which level of the property? 
 
A: Second. 
 
Q: Second? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: And the garage, when you come in through the garage, what 
floor do you enter into? 
 
A: The bottom. 
 
Q: And then you take another set of stairs to the second floor? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that's where the living room and kitchen are. Correct.? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the bedroom is upstairs, correct, Nicole's bedroom? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: I would like to show you some photographs, which I am going 
to mark as exhibits 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. 
0kay? 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 10 through 21 were marked for identification 
by the reporter and are attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I have handed you exhibits 10 through 21, which depict various 
articles of clothing. You've looked through exhibits 10 through 21, 
Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You recognize that clothing? 
 
A: Not necessarily, no. 
 
Q: Do you recognize any of it? 
 
A: Not necessarily, no. 
 
Q: When you say "not necessarily" 
 
A: I mean, I recognize Calvin Klein underwear-- 
 
Q: Let's-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Go ahead. Finish your answer, O.J. 
 
THE WITNESS: I recognize Calvin Klein underwear and I 
recognize white socks, yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Exhibit 10 is a picture of a jacket. Do you see that? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Is that yours? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you know whose jacket that is? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No idea if it's your jacket? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Could it be? 
 
A: If I could see the size-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Is it possible? Wait, wait. Don't answer that. 
 
MR. KELLY: I am sorry. What number are we on? 
 
MR. LEONARD: 10. 
 
MR. BAKER: That is irrelevant and has no probative value, and 
it's immaterial whether it could be when he has no recollection. 
There is no foundation, and I instruct him not to answer the 
question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If that standard were applied to the criminal 
trial, it would have lasted half the time. 
 
Q: Look at Exhibit 11. It depicts a shirt. Do you see that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that your shirt? 
 
A: I really couldn't say. 
 
Q: It says Palm Beach Polo. 
 
A: Does it? 
 
Q: Let me see. No, it doesn't. Next one does. 
 
Do you recognize that shirt? 
 
A: Do I? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: I recognize it as a white shirt. 
 
Q: Is it your shirt?

Q: Do you know whose shirt that is?

Q: I would like you to take a look at Exhibit 12, a shirt with the 
name "Palm Beach Polo" on it. Do you see that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you recognize that shirt? 
 
A: I've seen a shirt like this, and I think I've owned a shirt like this. 
 
Q: Do you still have it? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Have you seen it lately? 
 
A: I haven't looked for it lately. 
 
Q: Have you seen it since you were released from jail? 
 
A: Not that I know of. Possibly. I see all my shirts hanging in my 
closet. I don't look to see the decals on them, so I don't know. 
Maybe I have seen it. 
 
Q: You do own a shirt like the one depicted in Exhibit 12. Correct? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Take a look-- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Dan, which number was that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 12 
 
MR. BAKER: 12.

A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you receive clothing from Calvin--from Nike, as you did 
from Donna Karan, prior to being incarcerated? 
 
A: In my life? I'm sure I did. 
 
Q: Within a year of your incarceration? 
 
A: I have no way of knowing. 
 
Q: Did Nike provide from time to time free clothing to you?

house during the week of June 14th, 1994? 
 
A: I have no way of knowing.

your black bag in June of 1994? 
 
A: I have no way of knowing. 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: I don't know if those are my items, so I can't recall if I put them 
in this black bag or not. 
 
Q: Did you bring these items into the Bronco with you when you 
went on the trip to Nicole? 
 
A: I have no way of knowing. 
 
Q: Were they in the Bronco with you? 
 
A: I have no way of knowing. 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So if these items were recovered from your bag, you would 
have no way of saying that these are not now items. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. That's correct. 
 
Q: And if they were obtained from the Bronco where you were 
lying down, you would have no way knowing that they're not your 
items. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: That's kind of a double negative. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't get it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: In other words, if these were found in or near your bag in the 
Bronco, you can't say that they're not your items. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. If they were found in or near-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER-his bag in the Bronco-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER:-you can't say that they're your items, and I am going 
to instruct him not to answer based on the pictures because you 
can't tell from the pictures whether they're his, whether they're 
A.C.'s or someone else. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Who's talking about A.C.? He never 
mentioned A.C. Why did you mention A.C., Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. BAKER: My depo isn't being taken. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Exactly. That's my point. 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't care what your point is, and I'm trying to 
respond to your question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: My point is, stop trying to suggest answers. 
The witness can speak for himself. Just make an objection. 
 
MR. BAKER: Thank you very much. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Just make an objection, and we will move on. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, thank you very much for your speech, and I 
really am not taking legal advice from you, so I will put anything 
on the record that I feel like I am going to, so you-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You know better than that, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't tell me what I know and what I don't know-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Then don't testify. 
 
MR. BAKER:-in court telling me what the state of mind of my 
client was, and if you knew, you probably had some conversations 
with him in violation of the Code of Professional Conduct. So 
don't give me that nonsense. I'm-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Are you finished? 
 
MR. BAKER:--not going to put up with it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Are you finished? 
 
MR. BAKER: I'm finished for now, but I'll put anything on the 
record I want. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. You put those items in the Bronco? 
 
A: I have no way of knowing. 
 
Q: You deny doing it? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
He's answered the question, and he is not going to answer that. 
That's argumentative. 
 
Don't answer it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You don't know what clothes you own, Mr. Simpson? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Why not? 
 
MR. BAKER: Because you are arguing. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not arguing. 
 
MR. BAKER: No. You put photographs that are unidentifiable, 
and now you try to make a quantum leap, and I am not going to let 
him answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: In June of 1994 you were familiar with the clothing that you 
owned. Correct? 
 
A: To the most part, yes. 
 
Q: And did you put any of the items that I showed you into the 
Bronco? 
 
A: I don't know if those are any of my items. 
 
Q: Did you put them in the Bronco? 
 
A: I don't know if they were any of my items. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer it, O.J. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer the question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you--before you left of the house on the 17th, did you put 
anything into the bag? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you put? 
 
A: I believe I took a picture. One of the pictures was out, and I put 
it in the bag. 
 
Q: Did you put any clothing in there? 
 
A: On that day, no. 
 
Q: Did anybody do that for you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: I will represent to you that those items that I showed you were 
all items recovered from the Bronco. Do you have any way of 
disputing that? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't. He has asked and answered that, and we are 
not going-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you know for a fact that that's not true, that they were not in 
the Bronco? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He can answer that question. 
 
MR. BAKER: I told him he couldn't. Don't give my client legal 
advice. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What is the objection? 
 
MR. BAKER: The advice is it's asked and answered and it's 
argumentative, and I'm not going to let him answer it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's argumentative? 
 
MR. BAKER: You've been through this five times-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not getting a clear answer. 
 
MR. BAKER: Maybe that's your impression. I think you are 
getting very clear answers. He is not going to answer it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you know for a fact that those items were not in the Bronco? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: On what ground? 
 
MR. BAKER: I am not going to -You've gone through that. I am 
not going to allow you-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are not even going to state your 
objections? 
 
MR. BAKER: No, I'm not. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Well, we will just have to let the 
judge-- 
 
MR. BAKER: I think you should. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:--take a look at these objections. 
 
MR. BAKER: I think you should. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Identify every item that you know was in the black bag when 
you took it into the Bronco when you left Kardashian's house on 
the 17th. 
 
A: I believe three pictures, a gun, whatever underwear and stuff I 
may have had in there when I left Rockingham earlier in the week-
- 
 
Q: By "stuff," what do you mean? 
 
A: Maybe socks, underwear. underapparel. 
 
Q: Any other articles of clothing? 
 
A: Maybe -under-apparel. I don't think anything else could fit in 
there with the gun and the three pictures. 
 
Q: Anything else? 
 
A: Credit cards, keys, watches. The only reason I know that is I 
saw some kind of property list, but other than that, I don't know. 
 
Q: What keys were in there? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You have no idea? 
 
A: Uh-uh. No. I'm sorry. 
 
0: I would like to talk a little bit about the examination conducted 
on the 17th of June by Drs. Huizenga, Lee and Baden. You 
testified about that yesterday. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And they took some photographs? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Can you tell me, what were they saying to you at that time? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: You don't have any recollection at all? 
 
A: Not at all. 
 
Q: Do you know why they were examining you? 
 
MR. BAKER: And exclude any conversations that you had with 
your lawyers about that incident, about them being there. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Were lawyers there with them. 
 
A: I believe Shapiro was there. 
 
Q: While they were examining you? 
 
A: And Bob Kardashian. 
 
Q: While they were examining you? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Can you remember what was said? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know why they were examining you? 
 
MR. BAKER: Again, exclude any conversations that you had with 
your lawyers relative to the reason for their examination. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, not really. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Paula Barbieri was there also. Right? 
 
A: I believe she was in the house, yes. 
 
Q: And Denise Halicki. Right? 
 
A: I believe they were in the house. 
 
Q: Cowlings, too. Right? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Now, was that the first time you had been examined by any 
doctor that week? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What other examinations occurred that week? 
 
A: Dr. Huizenga examined me. 
 
Q: Now, where did Huizenga examine you? 
 
A: In his office. 
 
Q: Where is his office? 
 
A: In Beverly Hills. 
 
Q: Who else was present, if anyone? 
 
A: I believe my lawyers were. I'm not sure of this, but I believe my 
lawyers, Kardashian and Shapiro, were. 
 
Q: Kardashian, Shapiro and Huizenga? 
 
A: I believe. 
 
Q: Anybody else? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: What happened at that examination? 
 
A: I got examined. 
 
Q: They checked every part of your body? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And did they take photographs? 
 
A: I don't recall. Q: Did they find any injuries? Any injury marks? 
 
MR. BAKER: You mean from his past? 
 
MR.PETROCELLI: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: From his past operations? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Whatever. 
 
MR. BAKER: What do you mean, "whatever?" 
 
Don't answer that question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Any injury marks. Did they find any injury marks on your 
body? 
 
A: I don't recall. Whatever they examined, they examined. 
 
Q: You don't recall? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Let's go to the 17th for a second. Did the doctors then find any 
injury marks on your body? 
 
A: I don't recall. Whatever's on my body, I guess they found. 
 
Q: What injury marks did you have on your body on the 17th of 
June? 
 
MR. BAKER: If any. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: If any. 
 
A: You have to be a little more specific. Q: In what way? 
 
A:: What injuries. I mean, okay, they found that I have a bad left 
knee-- 
 
Q: Marks. 
 
A:--from knee surgery, I have scars on my knee. 
 
Whatever I had, whatever was on my body, they found. 
 
Q: What do you know that was on your body on the 17th of June? 
What marks? 
 
MR. BAKER: If you have--Are you talking about his scars? 
Because you went through this all yesterday. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I want to know specifically what marks that you had on your 
body, injury marks, bruises, cuts, whatever, on the 17th of June. 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what an injury mark is. He will answer 
the question bruises and cuts if he has any recollection. 
 
In other words, if you-- 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm not trying to be difficult. I don't understand 
what you mean here. I truly don't. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
What cuts, what bruises, what-- 
 
A: You mean like recent cuts, open cuts, old cuts? 
 
A: Including those, yes. 
 
A: Whatever they looked at. I got so many scars and bruises and 
old cuts on my body. Whatever was on my body. I didn't go with--
you know, I was in space, I guess. Whatever was on my body, they 
found. 
 
Q: Did you have any open cuts on your body on the 17th of June? 
 
A: l don't know about open, no. 
 
Q: Did you have any recent cuts on your body on the 17th of June? 
 
A: On my finger I had a recent cut. 
 
Q: Where on your finger? 
 
A: On my left hand on my--I don't know what you would call this 
finger (Indicating). 
 
MR. BAKER: Ring finger? 
 
THE WITNESS: No. Actually my middle finger on my left hand. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: On the 17th of June you had a recent cut on the middle finger of 
your left hand? 
 
A: I would say five-day recent, possible. 
 
Q: And did you have any other cuts on your body, other than the 
one on your finger that you just mentioned, on the 17th of June? 
 
A: I still, once again, I don't know. 1 don't know. 
 
Q: You don't know? 
 
A: No. I don't know how to answer that. I got cuts, as you can see, 
all over my body, and I--that's what I have. My body is--I've been 
in a lot of games-- 
 
Q: Let's talk-- 
 
A: --and I received a lot of injuries. 
 
MR. BAKER: Let him finish. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. I want to know about cuts that you had on your body on 
the 17th of June when the doctors were examining you that had 
been caused within the previous seven days. 
 
MR. BAKER: So is there a question in there? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: Regardless of what you want to know? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: Where is the question? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I want to know what those cuts were. 
 
MR. BAKER: Then ask him a question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I just did. 
 
MR. BAKER: You didn't. You told him what you wanted to know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Describe it to me. 
 
MR. BAKER: Describe any recent cuts that you had that were of 
five days' duration or less. 
 
THE WITNESS: The only one that I was aware of-- MR. 
PETROCELLI: I said seven days. 
 
THE WITNESS: The only one I was aware of is the middle finger 
one. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: One cut on the middle finger. 
 
A: That was the only one I was aware of, yes. 
 
Q: On the 17th. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You were aware of no other cuts. Correct? 
 
A: I wasn't aware of any cuts, no. 
 
Q: Were you aware of any abrasions on the 17th of June? 
 
A: On the 17th of June. I have trouble differentiating what I was 
aware of on the 17th that I found out after the 17th, so on the 17th I 
can't tell you what I was aware of. 
 
Q: What did you find out after the 17th? 
 
A: That I had other--on this side of my finger (Indicating) I had an 
abrasion. 
 
Q: On the-- 
 
A: On the finger next to the ring finger. And then-- 
 
MR. KELLY: Could we have a description of the finger? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: One second. 
 
Q: You just pointed to the ring finger. Correct? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: Ring finger being the one next to your pinkie. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: And you had an abrasion on the 17th of June on that ring finger. 
Is that correct? 
 
A: I don't know. As I said, I became --in sitting in that court 
looking at evidence, they talked about those things. 
 
Q: Your doctors did? 
 
A: On the stand, yes. 
 
Q: Drs. Huizenga and who? 
 
A: I don't recall. I'm pretty sure Dr. Huizenga did. 
 
Q: And they identified an abrasion on your ring finger. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On your left hand. 
 
A: I may be not characterizing it right when I said I had an 
abrasion. 
 
Q: Prior to the time they identified it in court, did you know that 
you had had that abrasion? 
 
MR. BAKER: Do you have any recollection of having that 
abrasion? 
 
THE WITNESS: Not really, no. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you tell the doctors on the 17th of any recent cuts or 
abrasions that you had received or injuries that you had received in 
the last seven days prior to the examination? 
 
A: I don't recall 
 
Q: Let's go back to the 15th, the Huizenga--was that at his office? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where is his office? 
 
A: In Beverly Hills somewhere. 
 
Q: Did he take pictures? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did anyone take pictures? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: What cuts within the previous five days did you have as of the 
15th of June that you can now remember? 
 
A: The one on my middle finger; I know that. And maybe the 
abrasion, I may have had it then or by then. 
 
Q: Any others? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: Do you remember telling the doctors about any cuts or bruises 
or abrasions you sustained within the prior five days, on the 15th of 
June? 
 
A: I think I talked about this middle finger cut, yes. 
 
Q: Did you talk about anything else? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: Did the doctors on the 15th ask you how you got that? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did they ask you on the 17th how you got that? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
MR. BREWER: Mr. Petrocelli, for the record, I would like to 
describe what the witness is pointing to twice with respect to those 
cuts. He has referred to something as an abrasion on his left 
middle--left ring finger, and actually what he has done--correct me 
if I'm wrong, Mr. Simpson--is you were motioning to the medial 
aspect of that finger-- 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
MR. BREWER:--inside of the finger, back and forth. 
 
Is that a more specific description or location of that abrasion? 
 
THE WITNESS: I believe so. 
 
MR. BREWER: And then the other description, you have rubbed 
on the middle finger of your left hand where the knuckle area is to 
describe a cut. 
 
Is that an accurate description of where that cut was located? 
 
THE WITNESS: That is correct. 
 
MR. BAKER: Where the joint is. He wasn't describing the 
knuckle. 
 
MR. KELLY: Excuse me. Can we go off the record for a moment? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Off the record. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. 1 of Volume 
II. The time is approximately 11:40, and we are off the record. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record. The time is 
approximately 11:43. This is the beginning of tape No. 2 of 
Volume II. 
 
MR. BAKER: Let me just correct what Michael Brewer said, 
because I think he mentioned the knuckle of O.J. Simpson's middle 
finger of his left hand, and we were talking about the joint that he 
was rubbing. 
 
MR. BREWER: That's correct, Mr. Simpson? 
 
THE WITNESS: That's correct, yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When you were examined by Dr. Huizenga on the 15th of June, 
had any recent cuts or abrasions or wounds that you may have 
received been fully healed by the 15th of June? 
 
A: I don't believe so, but I'm not sure. You'd have to ask the doctor. 
 
Q: What did you tell the doctor on the 15th as to how the cut on the 
middle finger was caused? 
 
MR. BAKER: If you told him anything. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't recall if we talked about it, but we may 
have. We may have. I don't recall. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
MR. BAKER: There is no foundation for that question if he doesn't 
recall 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: you don't recall what he said? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: He doesn't recall even talking about it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I thought you said earlier that you discussed how that injury 
was caused. 
 
A: I may have, but I don't--I may have, yes. 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: I don't know if I did. 
 
Q: And you can't recall. Right? 
 
A: I must have, but I don't recall. I don't recall any specific 
conversation. 
 
Q: Do you recall on the 17th any discussion as to how you were 
cut? 
 
A: Not at all. 
 
Q: And how did you suffer the cut on the middle finger? 
 
A: I broke a glass when I was in Chicago, and in the process of 
cleaning it up I evidently cut my finger. 
 
MR. KELLY: I couldn't hear that. I'm sorry, Mr. Simpson. 
 
THE Witness: I said, in the process of cleaning--not cleaning it up, 
but scooping it up, I evidently cut my finger. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you remember cutting your finger? 
 
A: I remember bleeding. 
 
Q: Do you remember cutting your middle finger on-- 
 
A: I remember bleeding and seeing that I was bleeding, so... 
 
Q: This was on the morning of June 13, 1994? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: At your hotel in Chicago? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Name of that hotel? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: And exactly how did you cut it with the glass? 
 
A: I was trying to scoop the glass into the sink with some toilet 
paper and I believe a towel. 
 
Q: You were at the sink of the hotel room? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In the bathroom. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What were you doing there at that time? 
 
A: I don't know. I was going back and forth to the phone. I was 
trying to pack. I was trying to brush my teeth. I was in and out of 
the bathroom. 
 
Q: And at some point you did something to a glass? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: A drinking glass? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was it like the glass next to you to your right? 
 
A: Yeah, a drinking glass. 
 
Q: About that tall (Indicating)? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: And did it have anything in it? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Can you show that glass on camera? Because I referred to it for 
the record. 
 
(Witness complies.) 
 
Q: Was it a glass about that size? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: And the glass was sitting where? 
 
A: On the counter in the bathroom. 
 
Q: Upright or upside down? 
 
A: I believe I had my toothbrush set in there. 
 
Q: And was there anything else in the glass besides your 
toothbrush? A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Had you already used your toothbrush? 
 
A: l don't recall. 
 
Q: When did you put the toothbrush in the glass? 
 
A: Probably the night before. 
 
Q: When you got into the hotel? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So you got to the hotel and you unpacked? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: You took out your toiletries? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And took your toothbrush out and put it in the glass? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Did you use that glass at any point before the time you hit it? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And tell me exactly how you cut your hand on that glass with 
the toothbrush in it on the counter and the sink. 
 
A: I don't believe that's correct, what you just said. 
 
Q: It was on the sink counter in the bathroom. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the toothbrush was in it. Right? 
 
A: Not when it broke, it wasn't. And I don't even know if the 
toothbrush was in it. I believe there were two glasses, and I just 
don't recall. 
 
Q: One with your toothbrush in it? 
 
A: I'm pretty sure. Normally when I check into a hotel, I'll put my 
toothbrush in a glass, so I'm assuming that I did-- 
 
Q: And the other glass-- 
 
MR. BAKER: You've got to wait until he finishes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am sorry, Mr. Baker. I'm jumping the gun a 
little bit. 
 
Q: Are you finished? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The other glass did not have a toothbrush in it? 
 
A: I don't believe so. I only had one toothbrush, and if I put it in, I 
would have only used one glass. 
 
Q: Were both glasses about the same size as the one you just 
showed on the video? 
 
A: I don't really recall. 
 
Q: And they were both standing or sitting on the countertop next to 
one another? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Was there anything underneath the glasses, like a towel or a 
napkin? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: And describe what you did to break the glass and cut yourself. 
 
A: I don't really know. 
 
Q: You said something about your palm of your hand? What did 
you say before? 
 
A: I didn't say anything about breaking the glass at all. You didn't 
ask me about breaking the glass. 
 
Q: How did you cut your finger? 
 
A: Cleaning up the broken glass. 
 
Q: How did the glass get broken? 
 
A: I don't know. I was--I don't know. I was out of it, and I was 
doing a few things and the glass broke, and I was going back and 
forth to the phone, and maybe I slammed it down. Maybe I 
knocked it over. I really don't know. 
 
Q: You are saying you do not know how the glass broke. Is that 
right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And at some point you saw that there was a broken glass. 
Correct? 
 
A: No. At some point I was trying to get my toiletries together. 
 
Q: And you saw there was broken glass around. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And where was the broken glass, Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Mostly on the counter, and I think one big piece was on the 
floor. 
 
Q: And was any of it in the sink? 
 
A: I don't know. Probably some of it. 
 
Maybe. I don't know. 
 
Q: And you then went to pick up the piece on the floor? 
 
A: I was going back and forth to the telephone, and I was trying to 
pack, and I was trying to get it out of my way as I was packing. 
 
Q: And you saw the broken glass, and you wanted to get it out of 
the way. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Were you on the phone at the time this was happening? 
 
A: I was going back and forth to the phone, So I can't tell you 
exactly. I wasn't really, you know, trying to remember everything I 
was doing at that time, so... 
 
Q: I am trying to focus on the point in time when you saw the 
glass. Okay? 
 
MR. BAKER: What do you mean, "when you saw the glass?" 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When you saw that there was broken glass on the-- 
 
A: At some point after I was told that my wife was dead--or that 
Nicole was dead, I broke the glass. In the process of going back 
and forth to the phone and trying to get packed, I cut myself trying 
to move the glass out of my way. Somewhere in that, that 
happened. 
 
Q: Now, how did you break the glass? 
 
A: I don't know. I think I answered that already. I don't know 
 
Q: You said--But you do remember breaking the glass. Right? 
 
A: I remember the glass was broke, yes. 
 
Q: But you don't know how you broke it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: But you are confident you broke it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you broke it, where was the glass? 
 
A: In the bathroom. 
 
Q: You went into the bathroom and then, while you can't 
remember how, broke the glass. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why did you break the glass? 
 
A: I had no purpose in breaking the glass. 
 
Q: Did you break one glass or two glasses? 
 
A: I believe it was one. 
 
Q: Did you throw the glass? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you squeeze it? 
 
A: I doubt that, but I don't recall. 
 
Q: When you broke the glass, were you on the phone? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you break the glass after you got off the phone? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you break the glass during the conversation when the 
detective told you that Nicole had been killed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What phone was it that you were using? 
 
A: The phone by the bed. 
 
Q: Was that the only phone in the room? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Was there a phone in the bathroom 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you use your cell phone in that room. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Immediately after you broke the glass, you then began--what 
was your next movement? 
 
A: I don't know. As I told you, I was going back and forth to the 
phone. Sometimes they had me on hold, sometimes various people 
I was talking about was trying to find me a flight, and I was just 
going back 151 and forth trying to pack, and that's-- 
 
Q: After-- 
 
A:--and in the midst of all of that this glass broke, and in the midst 
of all of that I was cleaning up the glass, and in the midst of all of 
that all of this happened. 
 
Q: After the detective told you Nicole had been killed-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: did you make another phone call before you broke the glass? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Do you believe you were on hold when you went to the 
bathroom and broke the glass? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Are you confident that you broke the glass while it was in the 
bathroom. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Right after you broke the glass, did you pick up the pieces? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: You don't know when you picked up the pieces? 
 
A: Someone in the midst of all of that, trying to pack a bunch of 
toiletries, I did. 
 
Q: And what is the length of time that that process took? 
 
A: Well, from the time-- 
 
MR. BAKER: What process are we talking about? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: After he found out about the--Nicole's death 
and then he was packing and rushing around and-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Making phone calls? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: --making phone calls. 
 
Q: That whole process, how long did that take? 
 
A: From the time the police told me to the time I was actually at 
Chicago O'Hare Airport on the plane was about 60 minutes. So I 
must have been on five, six, seven phone calls, packed, checked 
out of the hotel, got a ride to the airport and got on the plane in 65 
minutes, so--or in something roughly that long, so obviously a lot 
was going on. 
 
Q: How long were you in the hotel room after the call from the 
detective about your ex-wife's death? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: More than 20 minutes? 
 
A: I would think so, yes. 
 
Q: Half hour? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Longer? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: When you picked up the glass-Withdrawn. 
 
When you broke the glass, did it cause a cut at that time? 
 
A: I don't believe so, no. 
 
Q: And do you know where the glass struck your body? 
 
A: I don't know if it ever struck my body. 
 
Q: Your hand. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know even if you used your left hand to break the 
glass? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't know which hand you used? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you throw it against the wall? 
 
A: No. I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you throw the glass in the sink? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did you slam the glass down on the table--on the--I'm sorry--on 
the counter? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Picked it up and then slammed it down. Is that your best 
recollection of how you broke the glass? 
 
A: No, I didn't say that. I said that was a possibility. 
 
Q: You say it's a "possibility." Does that sound like what 
happened? 
 
A: That's a possibility. 
 
Q: Are there any other possibilities that you know of? 
 
A: Obviously a myriad of possibilities. 
 
Q: Do any come to mind besides slamming the glass down on the 
counter? 
 
A: I may have knocked it over. I may have hit it with my bag that I 
use to pack. 
 
Q: Do you believe-- 
 
A: I mean my bag that I have my things in. I don't know. I know 
when I--I don't know. I was sort of out of it at the time. 
 
Q: Did you break the glass accidentally? 
 
A: Yeah. I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: In other words, you were not intending to break the glass. 
Correct? 
 
A: I had no intentions of anything but getting out of there and 
getting home. 
 
Q: Were you attempting to break the glass? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You cut yourself when you picked up the pieces of the glass. 
Correct? 
 
A: I never--I picked up maybe a piece off the floor. I'm not sure. 
But I didn't pick up the other pieces, no. 
 
Q: You picked up a single piece from the floor? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: The floor of what? 
 
A: The bathroom. 
 
Q: Were you wearing shoes at the time? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: How were you dressed when the officer called? 
 
A: I was in bed. 
 
Q: How were you dressed? 
 
A: Probably naked. 
 
Q: Did you put any clothes on before you broke the glass? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you put any clothes on before you picked up the piece from 
the floor? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you put on any clothing before you began to pack up the 
items in the bathroom? 
 
A: Probably. 
 
Q: What clothes did you have on when you went into the bathroom 
to pick up the glass? 
 
A: Pardon me? 
 
Q: What clothes did you have on when you went into the bathroom 
to pick up the glass from the floor? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: And what did you use, if anything, to pick up the glass? 
 
A: I didn't pick up the glass. 
 
Q: The glass piece on the floor. 
 
A: Probably my hand. 
 
Q: Did you have anything in your hand, like a towel or a napkin? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Which hand did you use to pick up the broken piece of glass? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: When you picked it up, did you cut yourself? 
 
A: I don't think so, no. 
 
Q: So as of this point in time, your finger--your middle finger on 
your left hand was not cut. Correct? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Is that correct? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: When you picked up the piece of --There were no other cuts on 
your left hand at that time either. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And when you picked up the piece of glass-- 
 
A: Not that I know of, I should say. 
 
Q: When you picked up the piece of glass, what did you do with it? 
 
A: Put it in the sink. 
 
Q: And were there any other pieces in the sink at that time? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you cut yourself at all putting it into the sink? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you then--what did you do after you put the piece of 
glass in the sink? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you clean up any other pieces of glass? 
 
A: Eventually or at some point. yes. 
 
Q: Later on in the process of packing? 
 
A: And talking on the phone and getting dressed, yes. 
 
Q: When you say "and talking on the phone," you intermittently 
would be going back from the bathroom to the bedroom, make 
phone calls and go back in the bathroom. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many items did you have in the bathroom? 
 
A: Whatever my toiletries were. 
 
Q: They all come in what, a little travel bag? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how many items had you taken out of that travel bag the 
night before? 
 
A: Whatever was in it. 
 
Q: What was in it? 
 
A: Shaving cream, toothpaste, toothbrush, mouthwash, probably 
my medication. I'd say a razor blade, I guess, underarm deodorant. 
Whatever was in it. 
 
Q: Anything else you remember? 
 
A: Not that I recall right now. 
 
Q: What medication? 
 
A: Motrin. And vitamins. I always have my vitamins, Vitamin E, 
Vitamin C, sometimes, yes. 
 
Q: You laid all those things out on the bathroom counter the night 
before -- 
 
A: Yeah, probably. 
 
Q: --or right before you went to bed. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was there anything else you unpacked and put in the bathroom. 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: And when you say you packed up the items in the bathroom, 
you are now referring to the--you are referring to the items that you 
had taken out of the travel bag. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: You put them back in the travel bag. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you shave that morning? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did you take a shower? 
 
A: I may have. I don't believe so. 
 
Q: You don't believe you did? 
 
A: I was trying to get out of there, so I don't--I really can't imagine 
taking a shower. 
 
Q: Did you wash your face? 
 
A: I'm sure I did, yes. 
 
Q: Did you brush your teeth? 
 
A: Yeah, I'm sure I did. 
 
Q: Did you use the underarm deodorant? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you use any cologne or aftershave? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you take any medication that morning? 
 
A: I probably took my Motrin at some point. Maybe not then, but 
at some point. 
 
Q: Did you take it with water? 
 
A: Probably I took it--I try to take it with food, so I probably took 
it on the plane. 
 
Q: Did you eat anything in the hotel room? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you drink anything? 
 
A: Other than water, and I may have not drank water. I don't know. 
I really don't. 
 
Q: Do you remember drinking water? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, at what point in this process did you break--did you cut 
your finger? 
 
A: Again? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Somewhere in between going back and forth to the phone, 
trying to pack, trying to get dressed, at some point in there I cut my 
finger. 
 
Q: And on what piece of glass-Strike that. 
 
Did you cut it on one of the broken pieces of glass? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: On what piece? 
 
THE WITNESS: Can we take a break? 
 
MR. BAKER: Yeah, sure. 
 
THE WITNESS: Jesus Christ. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 12:02. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 12:11. BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: We have had a nine-minute break. You requested a break, Mr. 
Simpson. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you wanted to talk to your lawyers? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You requested the break because you were uncomfortable with 
the subject matter? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: You don't have to answer why you requested a 
break. You don't have to answer that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I am not asking about the content of your discussions. I am 
asking about your state of mind in the middle of the examination. 
 
MR. BAKER: His state of mind in the middle of examination is 
irrelevant, and I am going to instruct him not to answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you talk to your lawyers during the break? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why were you unable to continue with the examination? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
That assumes that he was unable to continue with the examination. 
He is entitled to take a break. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Why did you request a break during that part of the 
examination? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that either. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me? 
 
MR. BAKER: I said, "Don't answer that..." 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He whispered something, Mr. Baker. 
 
THE WITNESS: No, I did not. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You mouthed something. 
 
A: I think I'm allowed to mouth something to myself, aren't I? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What did you mouth? 
 
MR. BAKER: You don't have to answer that either, Mr. Simpson. 
You are entitled to mouth things. 
 
And if you want to continue to try to badger the witness, I've heard 
that on "Perry Mason," and it's not a good thing. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you want to tell us what you were mouthing? 
 
MR. BAKER: No, and don't tell him that either. That's not relevant 
to any issue in this case. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you brush your teeth before or after you cut the glass? 
 
MR. BAKER: That's been asked and answered. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Cut the glass? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. Withdrawn. 
 
Q: Did you brush your teeth before or after you broke the glass? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you brush your teeth before or after you picked up the 
glass? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: What did you do to clean up the bathroom? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, I don't know that he testified that he cleaned 
up the bathroom. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What did you do to clean up the broken glass? 
 
A: Took some toilet paper and some towel and just--I didn't really 
clean it up. I just tried to scoop it out of my way. 
 
Q: Toilet paper-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: and a towel. 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: What did you do with the toilet paper? 
 
A: I don't know. Either-I don't know. Some of it I know I had with 
me when I went to the lobby. 
 
Q: What did you do with the towel? 
 
A: I believe I left it in the room. 
 
Q: What I am trying to get to is this: You picked up some toilet 
paper and you picked up the towel for the purpose of scooping out 
of the way the glass. Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Yeah, brushing out of the way the glass. 
 
Q: Now, is this after you picked up the piece of glass on the floor 
and put it in the sink? 
 
A: I'm pretty sure it is, yes. 
 
Q: So now the glass is in the sink, a chunk of glass. Correct? 
 
A: I'm pretty sure, yes. 
 
Q: And there are other shards or chunks of glass on the counter 
top? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you wanted to get those glasses off the counter top. 
Correct? 
 
A: Actually I just wanted to put my stuff in my travel bag, and it 
was kind of around it, so... 
 
Q: You hadn't yet put the stuff in the travel bag? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You remember that distinctly? 
 
A: That's the only reason I took the time to sweep the stuff out of 
the way. 
 
Q: Did you remember that before the break? 
 
MR. BAKER: That's argument. Don't answer that question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So in trying to pick up the items and put them into the travel 
bag, you then went to the toilet paper holder and took a piece of 
toilet paper out? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And you put it in your hand? 
 
A: Yes. I probably wrapped it on my hand. 
 
Q: And then you also -Oh, you wrapped it around your fingers? 
 
A: No. I think I just took a ball of it and was using it, and then I 
probably used it-- 
 
Q: Which hand? 
 
MR. BAKER: Just a minute. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I apologize. 
 
THE REPORTER: "Probably used it"? 
 
MR. BAKER: In a sweeping motion and probably used a towel, is 
what he said, if I recall. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker, in fairness to me, his voice is 
tailing off, and I'm not quite sure when he is finished with his 
statement. That's why I'm interjecting. 
 
MR. BAKER: Then you can wait for a moment, unless you believe 
that the staccato approach is what you have to do to get an answer, 
but I think that he is entitled to the courtesy of finishing his 
answer, and you are attempting to pepper him with questions and 
not allow it, and that is not appropriate. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not going to debate that with you. 
 
Q: Let's go back to the examination. You got the toilet paper, 
wrapped it around what hand, by the way? 
 
A: I don't know. I may have just balled it up. 
 
Q: Balled it up. 
 
A: Possibly, yes. 
 
Q: Are you right-handed or left-handed? 
 
A: Right-handed. 
 
Q: What hand did you put the toilet paper in? 
 
A: I really don't know. At some point it could have been in both 
hands. 
 
Q: You took two pieces of toilet paper and balled them up into 
both hands? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You took one piece, balled it up into one hand? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Which hand? 
 
A: It could have been both hands, as I answered. 
 
Q: Can you demonstrate what you mean by that? 
 
MR. BAKER: You don't have to demonstrate, Mr. Simpson. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Could you show us what you mean? 
 
MR. BAKER: It's irrelevant whether he could. This is a question 
and answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Will you show us? 
 
MR. BAKER: No, he won't. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You will not show us? 
 
MR. BAKER: I indicated that he will not. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: On what theory? 
 
MR. BAKER: Because he doesn't have to. This is not show-and-
tell time. This is just tell time. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You took a piece of--single piece of toilet paper and put it into 
both hands at the same time. 
 
A: I don't think I've ever said that. 
 
Q: I am trying to find out what you're saying. 
 
MR. BAKER: Just say no. 
 
THE witness: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Just describe what you did with the toilet paper as best and as 
clearly as you can so we can all understand. 
 
A: I believe I took some toilet paper and used it and then at one 
point probably grabbed a towel and used it. 
 
C: When you took the toilet paper and used it, you mean you put it 
in the palm of your hand, and then you used it to scrape off the 
glass? 
 
A: I believe so. I could have also--I believe so. I'm not totally sure. 
I may have just-I may have cut my finger when I was using the 
towel, and I just took the toilet paper and wrapped it around my 
finger. I'm not really sure as the sequence. My concern at that time 
was to get a flight out of Chicago, and I was going back and forth 
to the plane [sic]. 
 
Q: You are not sure then that you took the toilet paper to scoop the 
glass into the sink at all. 
 
A: I know I had toilet paper in my hand during that period of time, 
yes. 
 
Q: But you don't know whether you had it before or after you put 
the glass into the sink. 
 
A: That is correct. That is correct. Well, during the process of 
doing it, at what process of doing it, I don't know if I did it in the 
middle of it or in the end of it, but at some point I did. 
 
Q: You do also remember taking a towel. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: A washcloth? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: What did you do with the washcloth? 
 
A: I'm pretty sure, as I answered before, that I left it in the room. 
 
Q: What did you do with the washcloth in reference to the glass? 
 
A: I'm sorry. I don't understand that. 
 
Q: Did you use the washcloth to scrape off the glass from the sink 
or to pick it up or to do anything with respect to the glass? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you have anything on your hands, either toilet paper or a 
washcloth, when you were scraping off the glass shards into the 
sink? 
 
A: At first I think I was just moving them, and then I grabbed some 
paper, toilet paper. I may have even been using one of my--my bag 
thing at one point, but then I do know I grabbed toilet paper at one 
point and a towel at one point. So I do know during the course of 
it, going back and forth, I may have done it all. 
 
I wasn't concentrating on it. I was concentrating on getting a phone 
call or getting back to the phone and trying to get dressed, is what 
my mind was on at the time, not on how I was moving the glass. It 
really wasn't something I was paying a lot of attention to. 
 
Q: Why did you--What was your purpose in going to the-- 
 
MR. BREWER: Mr. Petrocelli, before you go on, the witness as he 
is answering you is making a motion with his left hand, with the 
back of his hand, like he's scraping the glass or moving the glass, 
just for the record. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What was your purpose in using the toilet paper and the towel? 
 
A: I don't know. Either I had cut my hand or I was trying not to cut 
my hand, one or the other.  Q: That's what I'm getting to: Was the 
toilet paper and the towel intended to address a cut that just 
occurred, or did you pick it up to use it to clean off the sink? 
 
A: Both. As I said, it was either one or the other. I really wasn't 
really paying much attention to it at the time. 
 
Q: When you cut yourself, did you have toilet paper on the hand 
that you cut? 
 
A: I don't think so. I don't think so, but... 
 
Q: When you cut yourself, did you have a towel in the hand that 
you cut? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Where was the towel in the hand when you cut yourself? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: And how exactly with the towel in your hand did you cut 
yourself on the glass? 
 
A: I was trying to scrape whatever I had in my hand. I was trying 
to move it, and it happened. 
 
Q: Let the record reflect that you are demonstrating a sort of-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --a sweeping motion. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did the glass come into contact with the back of your hand? 
The front of your hand? Where? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Where did you cut yourself? 
 
A: On my knuckle. 
 
Q: Which knuckle? 
 
A: The middle knuckle of my left hand. 
 
Q: You cut yourself on the middle knuckle on the outside-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:--of your middle finger? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you cut yourself, did you feel any pain? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you see that you were bleeding? 
 
A: I would assume so at one point. Obviously I did, yes. 
 
Q: No. At that point when you cut yourself, did you notice blood? 
 
A: If I didn't feel pain, I didn't know I cut myself. So at whatever 
point I saw blood, I assumed that I had cut myself. 
 
Q: When did you first see blood? 
 
A: When I was in the bathroom. 
 
Q: Did you see blood before you left the bathroom to go out to the 
phone area? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did any blood drip off of your finger onto another surface? 
 
A: I would assume so. 
 
Q: Did you clean up any blood? 
 
A: When I wiped off the counter, I just pushed everything into the 
sink. 
 
Q: Including your blood? 
 
A: I don't recall that. 
 
Q: Do you remember using anything to clean off blood? 
 
A: Not particularly, no. 
 
Q: Did blood drip into the sink? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You don't know? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did blood drip on the floor? 
 
A: I don't recall. I wasn't trying to clean up the bathroom. 
 
Q: Did you wash out your cut? 
 
A: I believe--I don't think I washed it off because I just put--
whatever I had on it, I put some more paper on it, and that's what I 
went downstairs with. 
 
Q: Did you put your cut under the water, cold water, hot water, 
whatever, to wash it out? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you keep the toilet paper on your finger from the moment 
you observed the cut until you left the room? 
 
A: I would pretty much think so. I may have added some to it yes. 
 
Q: And did you also keep a towel on the cut? 
 
A: Until I left the room-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. "Keep a towel." He has never 
testified he put a towel on the cut. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you put the towel on the cut? 
 
A: I don't recall. I may have. It may have been in my hand also 
when I was going back and forth to the phone. 
 
Q: Was the blood bleeding onto the towel? 
 
A: l would assume so. 
 
Q: Do you know so? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you see blood on the towel? 
 
A: I wasn't looking for blood. 
 
Q: I know. Did you see it, though? 
 
A: I don't recall seeing it, no. 
 
Q: Did you see blood on the toilet paper? 
 
A: Yes, plenty. 
 
Q: Lots of it? 
 
A: When I got downstairs and I unwrapped it to get--to show the 
girl to get me a Band-Aid, yes. 
 
Q: Did you call down and ask for a Band-Aid or any first-aid when 
you saw the cut? 
 
A: I think from the time I cut my hand-I'm not sure of this, but 
from the time I cut my hand to the time I got downstairs wasn't so 
very long, but, no, I wouldn't have waited. I was trying to get out 
of the room. 
 
Q: From the time you cut your hand, you completed packing up 
your items in the bathroom. Right? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You put the rest of the stuff in the travel bag? 
 
A: I don't understand your question. 
 
Q: After you cut your hand and after you put the toilet paper 
around it, you then completed packing. Correct? 
 
A: Yes, at some point, yes. 
 
Q: Including packing up the items in the bathroom. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You put everything into the travel bag and zippered it up and 
walked out of the bathroom. Is that right? 
 
A: I don't know if that's in that sequence, but eventually obviously 
I did, yes. I may have-- 
 
Q: What are all the things you did before you left the room after 
you cut yourself and put the toilet paper around your finger? 
 
A: I don't know because I don't know at what point in time I had 
cut my finger. I was trying to get packed, as I told you. I was going 
back and forth to the telephone, as I told you. During the course of 
doing all of that, I cut my finger. At what point during all of that, I 
don't know. 
 
Q: When you left the hotel room, did you see any blood left 
behind? 
 
A: I didn't look for any blood left behind, so I wasn't really 
looking, no. 
 
Q: Did you see any? 
 
A: I don't recall seeing any, no. 
 
Q: Did you see any blood in the sheets of the bed? 
 
A: No, I don't recall seeing any, no. 
 
Q: Did you unpack your clothing when you got the room that 
evening? 
 
A: I hung up my suit, yes. 
 
Q: How many bags did you bring into the hotel room besides your 
travel bag? 
 
A: Bag? 
 
Q: Excuse me. Besides the little bathroom bag, how many other 
items of luggage did you bring into the hotel room with you? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, that assumes the bathroom bag was a separate 
piece of luggage and not in the grip, which is not what he's testified 
to. 
 
So don't answer that question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Are you saying that the items of toiletry that you described were 
carried in your grip? 
 
A: Are you asking me that question? 
 
Q: I'm asking that question now. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: There wasn't a separate little bag for the shaver and the 
deodorant; it was all in the grip? 
 
MR. BAKER: He has testified to you that your question--my 
objection was your question assumed that the toiletry bag was 
outside of the grip when he brought it into the room. That was my 
objection. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me see if I understand this. 
 
Q: You had toiletries in a separate toiletry bag which itself was in 
the black grip bag. Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And when you brought the toiletries into the bathroom to 
unpack right before you went to bed, as you previously described, 
did you bring just the toiletry bag or the whole grip bag into the 
bathroom? 
 
A: Probably just the toiletry bag. Probably just the toiletry bag. 
 
Q: So you left the grip bag in the bedroom. Correct? 
 
A: More than likely, yes. 
 
Q: So when you finished packing after you cut your finger, you 
took the toiletry bag and put it in the grip bag. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: What other items of luggage besides the toiletry and grip bag 
did you have in that room with you? 
 
A: What other--I'm sorry. 
 
Q: Items of luggage. 
 
A: Of luggage. 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
Q: Is that a garment bag? 
 
A: Yeah. It's a suitcase. 
 
Q: Suitcase or one of those-- 
 
A: Fold-over suitcase. 
 
Q: Fold-over. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Louis Vuitton? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Didn't I say "Louis Vuitton bag"? 
 
Q: You said "uh-huh." You have to answer yes or no. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what else? 
 
A: A suit bag. 
 
Q: A different suit bag than the Louis Vuitton bag? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And what else? 
 
A: That's all I recall. 
 
Q: So two suit bags, one grip, and in the grip bag a toiletry bag 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Anything else? 
 
A: That's all I recall. 
 
Q: What about your golf bag? 
 
A: I never took them out of--the guy who brought me there, I never 
took them out of his car, since he was going to take them to the 
golf course and put them on the golf cart and lay all of my stuff 
out. 
 
Q: So the golf bag never made it to your hotel room. Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Where exactly--Withdrawn What other unpacking did you do 
when you got to the hotel room besides take out the toiletry bag 
from the grip bag and hang up your clothing that you were 
wearing? 
 
A: I hung up what I was going to wear to play golf the next day-- 
 
Q: Was that a different set of clothing than you wore to the hotel 
that night? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You took those clothes out. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What were they? 
 
A: Golf clothes. 
 
Q: Shirt and pants? 
 
A: Shirt and pants, yeah. 
 
Q: Shoes? 
 
A: I'm sure my shoes was with my golf bag. 
 
Q: Which bag were the shirt and pants in that you took out? 
 
A: In my Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
Q: Did you do any other unpacking? 
 
A: Unpacking. There was nothing else to unpack. I took a book out 
of my thing. I may have looked at my travel thing again to see 
what the times were. 
 
Q: When you said, "There was nothing else to unpack," there were 
other items in these two suitcases. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What were they? 
 
A: Golf clothes, underwear, socks, maybe a pair of dress shoes. I'm 
not sure of that. 
 
Q: More golf clothes, you mean? 
 
A: Another golf outfit, yes. 
 
Q: And other attire as well? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: How long were you planning to be gone? 
 
A: One or two days. 
 
Q: It was not determined yet? 
 
A: If I would have found another golf game, since I had nothing to 
do Tuesday, I would have-that's why I brought the other golf outfit: 
So-which I do often, is--and if I saw Mike Ditka, I'd see if he 
wanted to play at his club. But, yeah, quite often I go to a 
tournament. If I have nothing to do and somebody got a good golf 
course to play, I'll stay and play golf. 
 
Q: So in the two suitcases you had two golf changes of clothing. 
Correct? 
 
A: No, that's not correct. 
 
Q: What did you have? 
 
A: I didn't have two suitcases. 
 
Q: You had the Louis Vuitton bag and another bag, you said, 
another suitcase. 
 
A: No, I didn't say that at all. 
 
Q: You told me that you had a Louis Vuitton fold-over suitcase. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you had a second item of luggage similar to that. Right? 
 
A: No. I had a suit bag. 
 
Q: What's a "suit bag"? 
 
A: When you buy a suit at a store, they put it in a bag and you 
carry it home. 
 
Q: I see. What was in that suit bag? 
 
A: A suit. 
 
Q: For what purpose? 
 
A: Because there were gonna be a cocktail party I would have to 
attend. 
 
Q: What suit was it? 
 
A: I don't know. It was a suit, whatever suit I took with me. 
 
Q: And the dress shoes were in the Louis Vuitton bag? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Did you come to Chicago with any other luggage besides the 
suit bag, the Louis Vuitton bag and the grip? 
 
A: My golf clubs. My golf clubs. 
 
Q: Anything other than that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have a second grip or duffel bag with you when you 
came to Chicago? 
 
A: No. If it wasn't in my golf bag, nothing else. 
 
Q: It might have been in your golf bag? 
 
A: What do you mean by "might"? 
 
Q: You said, "If it wasn't in my golf bag..." 
 
A: In my golf bag, I had various things in my golf bag. So if it 
wasn't golf related, no. 
 
Q: Well, we will get back to that. 
 
On your cut, Mr. Simpson, where did you cut yourself when you--
where on your finger? 
 
MR. BAKER: That's been asked and answered. Don't answer it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you cut yourself on only one location on your middle 
finger? 
 
A: As far as I knew, yes. 
 
Q: And that had--you had not cut that same location prior to 
coming to Chicago. Right? 
 
A: I don't think so, but--I don't think 
 
Q: And you weren't aware of any cuts on your left hand prior to 
coming to Chicago. Correct? 
 
A: No. I was--no, I never--no, I never saw a cut on my hand. No, I 
hadn't, no. That's correct. 
 
Q: That's correct. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
MR. BREWER: By "hand, " are you including fingers? 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. Yeah. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Brewer-- 
 
THE WITNESS: So a cut, no, I never saw a cut on my hand, no. 
That's correct. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Just so we get this clear, prior to coming to Chicago and prior to 
cutting your hand in Chicago, you were not aware of any cuts of 
any kind on your hand. Correct? 
 
A: I never saw a cut on my hand, no. That's correct. 
 
Q: You never saw any cuts on your hand or any of the fingers on 
your hand. Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: That would be true for either hand. Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And the only cut that you're aware of receiving as a result of the 
glass incident in Chicago is a cut on the knuckle of your middle 
finger. Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you did not--did you look at the cut when it happened or 
shortly after you noticed it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you examine it closely? 
 
A: I don't know about "closely." I saw it was bleeding. I saw it was 
cut. 
 
Q: How big was the cut? 
 
A: I don't know. I can't--it was a cut. There was blood on it, so I 
couldn't tell. But I could just tell it was cut. 
 
Q: Did you think you needed a stitch? 
 
A: Not necessarily, no. 
 
Q: Was there any skin that was jagged or abraded or pulled off the 
area of the cut? 
 
A: It looked like a cut, whatever a cut looks like. 
 
Q: A big cut? 
 
A: It looked like a cut. 
 
Q: Did you notice any other cuts around it or any abrasions? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Just the single cut. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, why don't we take our lunch break 
now. 1:30. 
 
MR. BAKER: All right. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 12:33. 
 
(At the hour of 12:33 p.m., a luncheon recess was taken, the 
deposition to resume at 1:30 p.m.) 
 
(At the hour of 1:37 p.m., the deposition of ORENTHAL JAMES 
SIMPSON was resumed at the same place, the same persons being 
present.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 1:37. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 8-A was marked for identification by the

EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson, I would like to mark as Exhibit 8-A a calendar in 
which the Xeroxing has been reduced to a single page to make it 
more readable. I will represent to you this is a copy of what was 
previously marked as Exhibit 8. 
 
Do you see that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that appears to be the same calendar that we discussed 
before that was filled out by Randa? 
 
A: One of the two that was filled out by Randa. 
 
Q: Okay. This appears to be a calendar pertaining to your 
appointments, though. Correct? 
 
A: For the most part, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. When family appointments or matters, events, were listed 
on this calendar, where would Randa get that information? 
 
A: I don't get the question. 
 
Q: In other words, there are items on the calendar not business 
related but family related. like-- 
 
A: Whose family? 
 
Q: Your family. 
 
A: Show me. 
 
Q: Take a look at June 12, 1994 on Exhibit 8-A. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: What does that say? 
 
A: I can't--oh, "Recital," yeah. 
 
Q: "Recital." What does it say underneath it? 
 
A: "Recital" is underneath. 
 
Q: It says, "Sydney Recital Dance 5:00." Do you see that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that pertains to your daughter Sidney's dance recital at 5:00 
p.m. on June 12. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah, that's one of the two things here. 
 
Q: Where would Miss Randa obtain that information to put on the 
calendar? 
 
A: I would imagine from Nicole. 
 
Q: Not from you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: She called Nicole from time to time to get these appointments, 
or Nicole called her? 
 
A: Nicole would normally call her and give her various things she 
wanted Cathy to put on my calendar. 
 
Q: I see. Is that what happened with the 5:00 p.m. dance recital for 
Sydney on June 12, 1994? 
 
A: Possibly, yes. 
 
Q: Do you recall Nicole telling or asking you to come to the 
recital? 
 
A: Yes. She wanted to know if I was going to be in town. 
 
Q: When did you and she have that conversation? 
 
A: Numerous times, but the last time I believe was the Thursday or 
so before the reciul, Wednesday or Thursday night. 
 
Q: June 8 or June 9, 1994? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, how did she tell you that; on the phone or in person? 
 
A: Tell me what? 
 
Q: That she wanted you to--wanted to know whether you would be 
in town and be able to attend Sydney's dance recital. 
 
A: On the telephone. She just wanted to know whether I would be 
in town for the dance recital. I think she spoke to Cathy also during 
that week and talked about how many tickets I might need. 
 
Q: And what did you tell her? That is, what did you tell Nicole 
when she asked you if you would be in town for the dance recital? 
 
A: That I'd be back in town. 
 
Q: How many tickets did you tell her you needed? 
 
A: l didn't know if--she said she was getting a bunch--I don't know 
how many. I don't recall right now --and wanted to know if Arnelle 
and Jason was gonna go. I think it was sold out, which it always is. 
And I said I would see if--I think I told her I told Cathy to try to get 
two, and she had hers, and she wasn't really sure who all was 
coming, you know, things like that. 
 
Q: You told her to make available tickets for Jason and Arnelle? 
 
A: No, that's not correct. That's not what I said either. l said I didn't 
know if Jason or Arnelle--I think she asked me, were they going to 
come, and I said I didn't know. I said I did tell Cathy to see if she 
can get a few, and that was about the extent of it. 
 
Q: Did you and Nicole discuss this before June 8 or June 9 on 
Wednesday or Thursday night, that is, whether or not you would be 
attending Sidney's dance recital? 
 
A: I know the dance recital had come up before then. We knew the 
dance recital was coming up. I don't know the exact conversation 
was would I be in town, but it could have come up, yes. 
 
Q: How long in advance of June 12 did you know about that 
recital? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: A month? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you and Nicole discuss whether Paula Barbieri would 
attend with you? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Did that subject come up at all? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Nicole never mentioned it to you? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: You never mentioned it to her? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Do you know whether she tried to find out from any other 
source whether Miss Barbieri would be attending with you? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Did you ask her for a ticket for Miss Barbieri? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you plan to take Miss Barbieri with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: There is another entry on that day that says "Kallie" or "Kallic 
Shower." Do you know what that is? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know who that person is? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whose entry that pertains to? Excuse me. Do you 
know whether that pertains to you or to Miss Randa or-- 
 
A: It's Cathy's calendar, so I assume it pertains to Cathy. 
 
Q: When you say, "It's Cathy's calendar," it's a calendar that Cathy 
kept? 
 
A: As I explained to you before, yes. 
 
Q: Did Cathy in 1994 also put on Nicole's own appointments on 
this calendar? 
 
A: I don't know what you mean. 
 
Q: In other words, if Nicole had appointments not involving you, 
like going out to lunch with somebody, would she coordinate with 
Cathy at all? 
 
A: I doubt it. 
 
Q: Cathy wasn't a calendar keeper for Nicole, in other words? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That's correct. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: I would like to go to the subject of the luggage-- 
 
MR. BAKER: What? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I want to go back to the subject of luggage and specifically the 
luggage that you took with you to Chicago, when you arrived in 
Chicago on the morning of June 13th. 
 
So far you testified that you had with you the golf bag. Correct? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You also testified that you had the Louis Vuitton bag. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you also said you had your grip, your black grip. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you also said you had the-a bag with the suit in it. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, was that bag with the suit in it the Louis Vuitton bag? 
 
A: No. Now you talking about the 12th? 
 
MR. BAKER: June 12. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: June 12. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is there--Whatever luggage you went to Chicago with on June 
12th, you came back with. Correct? Is that correct? 
 
A: In a sense, yes. 
 
Q: Explain what you mean. 
 
A: I didn't know if my golf bag had come back. 
 
Q: But you brought back the Louis Vuitton bag, correct-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --with you when you came back the morning of the 13th. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you brought back the black grip. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you brought back the suit bag. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were carrying those three items separately. Correct? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q: When you came back from Chicago. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How were you carrying them? 
 
A: The Louis Vuitton bag and the grip. 
 
Q: Where was the suit bag? 
 
A: In the Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
Q: But when you went to Chicago, the suit bag was not on the 
Louis Vuitton bag? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Why was that? 
 
A: Because I didn't want it to be wrinkled when I went to this 
affair. I wouldn't have had time to get it pressed. 
 
Q: It didn't fold, that bag, the suit bag? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
Q: It wasn't folded? 
 
A: At times, if I laid it gently, I'd fold it gently, but-- 
 
MR. BAKER: I think you are talking about two different things. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: The suit bag when you went to Chicago on June 12 from Los 
Angeles, it wasn't the type of bag that folded and snapped. It was-- 
 
A: No, it didn't fold and snap, but it folded over my arm or 
something. 
 
Q: Okay. Did the golf bag have any other bags in it? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Talking about now when you left Los Angeles on June 12. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What bags were in the golf bag? 
 
A: I believe another pair of shoes. That had a pair of shoes in it, 
which is not really a bag. It's a little black thing that's a shoe bag. 
And a bag that had a windbreaker and some balls in it. 
 
Q: Golf balls? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was the color of that bag? 
 
MR. BAKER: What was "that bag"? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The bag that had the windbreaker and golf 
balls in it. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm not sure. They had it in court one day, but I 
can't recall what the color was. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Is that a bag that you always carried in your golf bag? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You always carried the shoe bag in your golf bag. Correct? 
 
A: Not always, no. 
 
Q: How would you transport your shoes when they were not in the 
shoe bag? 
 
A: Sometimes I'd put them directly in the golf bag, and sometimes 
I'd just throw a shoe bag in, and sometimes I carried more than one 
pair of shoes, and the shoe bag--the shoes would be in the shoe 
bag. Only one pair fits in the shoe bag, and sometimes I carried 
more than one pair of shoes, golf shoes, with me. 
 
Q: So the shoe bag, when it doesn't have any shoes in it, would 
also be carried in the golf bag? 
 
A: No, not necessarily. 
 
Q: You might carry it separately from the golf bag? 
 
A: May not carry it. 
 
Q: Just leave it home? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: But on this occasion you had the shoe bag-- 
 
A: I believe. I'm not sure about that. I just know when they brought 
all the golf stuff in court, the shoe bag was there, so I'm assuming 
it was in the overall bag. 
 
Q: And were the golf shoes in the shoe bag? 
 
A: A pair of golf shoes were in the shoe bag, yes. 
 
Q: Did you bring another one with you to Chicago? 
 
A: There were some black shoes that I know were in the outer 
cover bag that was definitely in there. 
 
Q: Golf shoes? 
 
A: Golf shoes, yes. 
 
Q: So you went to Chicago on June 12 with two pairs of golf 
shoes. 
 
A: Possibly, yes. 
 
Q: One in the golf club bag and another in the shoe bag which was 
in the golf club bag. Correct? 
 
A: No. One was in the golf shoe bag that was in the golf bag, I 
believe, and the other one definitely was just in the cover bag 
laying in the shoe-in the golf bag, cover bag of the golf bag. 
 
Q: What is a cover bag? 
 
A: It's a bag that you use to--normally use to travel with. 
 
MR. BAKER: It's so that when you get there, you have all of your 
irons and your Callaway woods are still there, and the bellman-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You mean the cover that goes over the clubs-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: and snaps onto the golf bag? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you're saying-- 
 
MR. BAKER: No. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Well, wait a second. You said "Yes." Your lawyer said "No." 
Explain yourself, Mr. Simpson. 
 
A: What do you want me to explain myself? You're the one that's 
confused. What do you mean, explain myself? 
 
Q: I don't understand your answer. 
 
A: There's a cover bag that you can put your whole golf bag in 
when you travel. 
 
Q: And in the cover bag which surrounded the entire golf bag-- 
 
A: There was-- 
 
Q: Some shoes. 
 
A: --shoes, yes. 
 
Q: Is there a compartment in the cover bag for the shoes? 
 
A: I don't recall. I don't recall. This is--was a relatively new cover 
bag. 
 
Q: Okay. And in the golf bag, you said you had the shoe bag with 
shoes in it. 
 
A: I believe so. I'm not a hundred percent sure of that, but I believe 
so. 
 
Q: Now, we had this other bag that had the windbreaker and the 
golf balls. Right? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: What was the color of that bag? 
 
A: I'm not totally sure of that. 
 
Q: What is your best recollection? 
 
A: Blue, bluish-gray, blue. 
 
Q: What was the color of the windbreaker? 
 
A: Blue or green. One or the other. I'm not a hundred percent sure 
of that. 
 
Q: Was it your windbreaker? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And had you used it before? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Where did you get that windbreaker? 
 
A: From Hertz. 
 
Q: Did you see that windbreaker in court also? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen that windbreaker after you packed it for 
Chicago? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen the blue or bluish-gray bag-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --that was shown in court? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when it was shown in court, did it have anything in it? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did it have golf balls in it? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Do you always take that bag with the windbreaker and golf 
balls when you play golf? 
 
A: Never. Never before. 
 
Q: What made you do it this time? 
 
A: When I was getting balls, it was the only bag--I don't know if it 
was the only bag, but it was a bag that was in the back of my 
Bentley when I was trying to find balls to take to Chicago with me. 
 
Q: It's not a bag that you bought at a sports store or a golf store to 
carry golf balls, is it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What was the use of that bag that you usually made? 
 
A: For me it was no use at all. I play in a lot of tournaments, and 
they give you this crap all the time and it ends up in your car and 
your house, and my kids, people, take them or housekeepers use 
them. I get a lot of them, I mean a lot of them, and it was just 
something that was in the trunk of my car. 
 
Q: How many of them were in the trunk? 
 
A: I don't know. I didn't really count what was in the trunk of my 
car at that time. 
 
Q: Was there more than one such bag in the trunk of your Bentley? 
 
A: Could have been. 
 
Q: You pulled that bag out. Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Well, I just grabbed a bag that was small that I could put balls 
in and a windbreaker in. 
 
Q: Was the bag empty? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the windbreaker that you put in it, is that a windbreaker 
that you bring with you to golf courses? 
 
A: I hadn't, but I--it was given to me at a golf course during a golf 
tournament, so it was-you know, it was a gift that Hertz give out at 
one of our golf tournaments. You give it to the golfers. 
 
Q: When did you receive that windbreaker? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Had you ever used it before? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Where was it on the evening of June 12 when you went to get it 
for your trip? 
 
A: Laying in the trunk of my car. 
 
Q: The windbreaker? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where were the golf balls that you put into this bag? 
 
A: In various bags in the trunk of my car. 
 
Q: What kind of bags? 
 
A: Just bags they give you at the country club to put your shoes in 
when you finish playing golf. 
 
Q: So in those bags were golf balls? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you emptied out those golf balls from those bags and put 
them into this bluish-gray bag? 
 
A: No . 
 
Q: What did you do? 
 
A: I took some out and used some, and the rest I left in those bags. 
 
Q: How many golf balls did you take out? 
 
A: Four or five, six, that I took with me; three, four, five that I hit 
away. 
 
Q: You hit away right there? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: At Rockingham? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you hit those balls away, did you retrieve them and 
bring them with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You already had golf balls in your golf bag. Correct? 
 
A: I may have. I had no new golf balls. I had no new balls, so I 
may have had one or two used balls, but not many at all. 
 
Q: And these balls you took from the Bentley trunk were all new? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: They were used? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what was the brand? 
 
A: Maxfli lOOs. 
 
Q: All of them were? 
 
A: The ones that I took. 
 
Q: Were you specifically looking for Maxfli 100s? 
 
A: Specifically, yes. 
 
Q: And you had other types of balls in there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So when you were searching your trunk, you looked for the 
Maxfli 100s in the various bags of balls you had there, took out 
four or five or six and put them in the bluish-gray bag. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then hit three, four or five others. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you took the windbreaker and put that in the bag, too? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did the bag have a zipper? 
 
A: I don't--I'm not sure. Probably. 
 
Q: Did you take anything else out of the trunk in addition to what 
you've just described? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was that? 
 
A: Pitching wedge. 
 
Q: What was the make? 
 
A: Callaway. 
 
Q: Was it a new pitching wedge? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: An old one? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you have any other clubs in the trunk? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: A whole set? 
 
A: At least. 
 
Q: Two sets? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You specifically looked for pitching wedge? 
 
A: No. I was looking for a sand wedge. 
 
Q: Did you find one? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How many pitching wedges were there? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Why did you pick this one? 
 
A: Because it's the closest thing to a sand wedge. 
 
Q: Did you take anything else out? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And then you closed the trunk? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did you do? 
 
A: Hit some balls away. 
 
Q: While the trunk was open? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why did you leave the trunk open? Let me ask you this: What 
club did you use to hit the balls with? 
 
A: Pitching wedge. 
 
Q: The one you took out? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why did you leave the trunk open while you did that? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: But you specifically recall it was open? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: After you hit the balls, did you then close the trunk? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did go into it again? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
Q: To do anything, to get any more balls out, to put something 
back. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you do? 
 
A: Put the pitching wedge back. 
 
Q: Did you take it with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did the golf clubs that you did take with you include a sand 
wedge? 
 
A: To Chicago? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever locate a different sand wedge to take with you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So you ended up going with the sand wedge in the set. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was that a new set of clubs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was the make? 
 
A: Callaway. 
 
Q: Had you ever used them before? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did you get the clubs? 
 
A: Sometime in May. 
 
Q: May of what year? 
 
A: '95--'4. 
 
Q: How did you get them? 
 
MR. BAKER: What do you mean, how did he get them? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you buy them, or were they given to you? 
 
A: They were given to me. 
 
Q: Who gave them to you? 
 
A: Callaway. 
 
Q: The company? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What representative? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. This is irrelevant. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It's not irrelevant. 
 
MR. BAKER: Tell me what relevance it is what representative 
gave him Callaway golf clubs. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We are going to go ask him if it's true. 
 
Q: Who gave it to you? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer it. 
 
THE WITNESS: Callaway. I told you. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: No. What person at Callaway? Eli Callaway himself? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer the question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Have you ever met Mr. Eli Callaway? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. That's irrelevant. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What are the objections, just for the record? 
 
MR. BAKER: It's irrelevant. It's irrelevant and immaterial to any 
issue in this case. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are mistaken, but we will proceed. 
 
Q: From what location in your Rockingham property did you hit 
those golf balls? 
 
A: My front yard. 
 
Q: On the grass? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you tee them up? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You just put them on the grass? 
 
A: Just dropped them on the grass. 
 
Q: Did you take full swings? 
 
A: Once or twice I did, yes. 
 
Q: And were you hitting in the direction of Rockingham, Ashford 
or someplace else? 
 
A: A couple in the direction of--in the direction of Rockingham but 
not to Rockingham, and a couple in the direction of Ashford. 
 
Q: Which ones did you take the full swing, which direction? 
 
A: Ashford. 
 
Q: Is there a clearing where you can hit the ball far without hitting 
anything? 
 
A: Not really. 
 
Q: Did it hit anything? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: In other words, when you took the full swing and hit those balls 
with your pitching wedge, did you hear any sound when the ball 
landed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. How far do you hit a full pitching wedge? 
 
A: It depends. 
 
Q: How far-- 
 
A: Full swing, you mean? 
 
Q: Full swing, yeah. 
 
A: It depends. If I'm trying to hit a full-swing pitching wedge, 
anywhere from 120 to 130 yards. If I'm trying to make it into a 
sand wedge, a lot less. 
 
Q: Is that what you were trying to do? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So by taking less than a full swing? 
 
A: No. By changing your grip and the head of the club. 
 
Q: Is that what you did when you took those full cuts? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You imitated a sand wedge swing, in other words? 
 
A: Yeah. I was trying to get it up, the ball up. 
 
Q: Did you take a divot in your grass? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did the club dig up any grass or dirt? 
 
A: I just don't recall if I took a divot. I don't normally take divots, 
but I don't recall. I'm sure there was, but --some grass taken up, 
but... 
 
Q: You hit two or three balls in that direction? 
 
A: Yeah. I mean, just a couple. I chipped a couple real--five or six 
yards, brought them back, then I hit a couple into the sand and a 
couple-you know, when I say "a couple," two or three one way and 
then whatever was left the other way. 
 
Q: Now, you said you first chipped a couple of balls five or six 
yards away. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Where did they land? In the yard? 
 
A: Which ones? 
 
Q: The ones you chipped five or six yards away. 
 
A: Yeah, right on the grass. 
 
Q: On the grass. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Then did you hit those balls into the sand? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What sand are you referring to? 
 
A: My playground. 
 
Q: Where the kids play? A: Uh-huh. I skulled one of them and it 
hit the equipment, I don't know where it went. 
 
Q: Made a loud sound? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: It bounced someplace, and you didn't retrieve it? 
 
A: True. 
 
Q: Do you know if it stayed on the property? 
 
A: I don't know that one. I don't know. 
 
Q: You skulled it-- 
 
A: Sculled it. 
 
Q:--meaning you made more solid contact with the ball than you 
intended. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the other balls landed in the sand? 
 
A: I believe so, in or around there. Within the walls of the 
property, I'm pretty sure. They could have hit into the ivy there, but 
this should have been inside of the property. 
 
Q: Did you then take some cuts in the sand? 
 
A: Oh, no. No. 
 
Q: As though you were in a sand trap. 
 
A: No. No. I just left them there. 
 
Q: You left the balls in the sand trap --in the sand? 
 
A: Wherever they went, I-- 
 
Q: Did they land in the sand? 
 
A: I don't know. One of them should have, at least, but I really 
don't know. 
 
Q: Wherever they landed, you didn't retrieve them. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And then you said you took some fuller swings and hit the 
remaining balls? 
 
A: Yeah, one or two. I don't really recall. But one or two I tried to 
hit over my tree into the yard across Ashford. 
 
Q: As though you were taking a sand --a shot with a sand wedge. 
Right? 
 
A: For the most part, yeah. 
 
Q: And how far did that ball travel? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you have any estimation? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Under a hundred yards? 
 
A: I would think so, yes. 
 
Q: Between 50 and 70? 
 
A: 40 and 70, I would say. 
 
Q: Between 40 and 70. 
 
A: I hope so. 
 
Q: And the other ball, not that one that you tried to hit over the 
tree, where did you hit that one when you were taking a full swing? 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know. I thought that's what you were just 
talking about. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He said he hit one ball high 40 to 70 yards. 
 
Q: Right? 
 
A: Both of them about the same, but as I said, one of them may 
have gotten through and one of them may not have. I don't recall. 
 
Q: Gotten through where? 
 
A: One of my big trees that are on my property. 
 
Q: I see. If it did not get through the big tree, would it have landed 
somewhere in your property? 
 
A: It could have gone through, but it didn't clear the big tree. I do 
this all the time, so it's hard to recall if that moment that was the 
exact one, but I do know I hit something over to Mrs. Nebeker's, 
because it's my practice to always do that. 
 
Q: Over to Mrs. what? 
 
A: Nebeker's yard. 
 
Q: How do you spell that name? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Could you say it a little more slowly? 
 
A: Nebeker. 
 
Q: Has Mrs. Nebeker ever talked to you about your hitting golf 
balls there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever spoken to her about the fact that you've done 
that? 
 
A: She's seen me actually on her-in her yard hitting balls many, 
many times. 
 
Q: And she has never said anything to you about it? 
 
A: She likes to talk to me, but she's no longer living, but she would 
sit in her front door. 
 
Q: When did she die? 
 
A: I think early '94. 
 
Q: And who was living at that property when you hit the golf balls 
in that direction? 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: Was the house vacant? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you ever hit her with a golf ball? 
 
MR. BAKER: You don't have to answer that. 
 
You couldn't resist. Is that the reason that she passed-- 
 
THE WITNESS: No, that's not the reason. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That is where he was going with it, but I 
didn't even have the nerve to ask that. 
 
Q: Did you take any other shots of a greater distance than 
chipping-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q:--other than the two over the big tree? 
 
A: No. No. The one or two, as I said, but no. 
 
Q: What time was it when you did that? 
 
A: I believe around or a little after 10:00 o'clock. 
 
Q: What fixes that time in your mind? 
 
A: Nothing in particular, except I knew I was back from having a 
burger, and then I just know when I got upstairs --it wasn't but 15 
or 20 after 10:00 by the time I got upstairs, so I knew it had to--and 
other than turning lights out in my house, I can't imagine--I don't 
recall doing anything else before I got upstairs. 
 
Q: Was there any light on your property where you hit the golf 
balls? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And what was illuminating that area? 
 
A: It's not that it was illuminating the area, but it was illuminating-
-there is a light in a tree that's right above where I was hitting, and 
my garage was open. 
 
Q: When you hit the balls on the grass, it was near the big tree? 
 
A: Well, yeah. 
 
Q: And - 
 
MR. BAKER: "Near" is all relative. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me? 
 
MR. BAKER: "Near" is all relative. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: How many yards were you from the big tree? 
 
A: From the base of the big tree? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Seven, eight, ten maybe. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: Whatever the width of my driveway is. It's on the other side of 
my driveway, and whatever the width of the driveway. 
 
Q: Right on the other side of the driveway? 
 
A: Yeah. But the tree hangs over, you know, so the light would be 
hanging over a little more than the base of the tree. 
 
Q: Was it light out where you were hitting? 
 
A: The way it is always in my front yard. I wouldn't call it light, 
but I can hit a couple of balls away. 
 
Q: Now, this light, is this actually in the tree, the light? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How does the light get turned on? 
 
A: It's on automatic. 
 
Q: Was there any other light illuminating that area where you were 
hitting the golf balls? 
 
A: Maybe coming from my garage a little bit. When you say 
"illuminating" an area, it wasn't like shining on the area, but I 
could see what I was doing. 
 
Q: Okay. Was there any other light besides that tree light that 
would have enabled you to see what you were doing? 
 
MR. BAKER: And the garage light coming from his garage? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, the garage light-- 
 
A: Yeah, the garage light. And I don't know. I think I have a little 
walkway light that was in front of me, but I don't think it does 
much illuminating. 
 
Q: Was the garage door open or closed? 
 
A: Open. 
 
Q: The garage door was open. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And the garage light was on in it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When that garage light is on, it passes some light out of the 
garage and near this area-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: where you were hitting the golf balls? 
 
A: It's not a spotlight or anything, but yes. 
 
Q: Were there any other lights on outside the property or from 
inside the house that would cast light onto the area where the golf 
balls were? 
 
MR. BAKER: By that you are excluding streetlights? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Any lights. 
 
MR. BAKER: Because you said "inside the house" and-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I guess I was excluding streetlights. 
 
THE witnesS: I don't know. The coach lights may have been on in 
the front of my door. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What are coach lights? 
 
A: Two lights that hang on the outside of the front door at my 
entryway there. 
 
Q: Were they on? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Do they go on automatically? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You have to turn them on? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where is the light switch? 
 
A: Right inside of my front door. 
 
Q: Inside the house. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how do you turn the garage light on that was on? Inside the 
garage? 
 
A: No. One portion comes on automatically; and the other portion, 
as you enter the garage, you have to turn --the back portion you 
have to turn on, and then the front portion comes on as the garage 
door comes up. 
 
Q: One of those Genie-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: --electric garage doors? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: When the garage door opens auto---with a remote control or a 
clicker on the wall? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: There is a light on, and that stays on at all times? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
Q: In other words, there is a light on in the mechanism, the garage 
door mechanism. Correct? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you open the garage door, this light goes on. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Does that light stay on as long as the garage door is open? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Or does the light go off after a few minutes? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you have the same garage door opener now? 
 
A: Yes. a Do you have the same garage door-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:--and same equipment? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The other light, in the back of the garage, you have to manually 
turn on. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was that light on? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When was the last time before June 12th that you hit golf balls 
at around 10:00 o'clock at night from your property at 
Rockingham? 
 
A: I spent most of April in Puerto Rico, so probably--I don't know 
if it would be 10:00 o'clock, but certainly at night many times. 
 
Q: When was the last time of the many times? 
 
A: I have no--I don't recall. 
 
Q: The last time before June 12th. 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: You can't give me a single day? 
 
A: I can't recall. 
 
Q: Was it the day--night before? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was it in June of 1994? 
 
A: It may have been in June. 
 
Q: What night? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You want to look at your calendar? Would that help you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Maybe by refreshing your recollection as to whether you were 
in town or not? 
 
A: I don't get what you're saying. 
 
Q: Well, take a look at 8-A and look at June and tell me what 
evening before June 12 you last hit golf balls at Rockingham. 
 
A: I told you I may have. It's something I do often. So I don't have 
any specific memory, but I know I would have because it's 
something that I do often. I don't know about 10:00 p.m. Certainly 
I drop balls and hit them all the time. I actually had a net that I put 
up on my garage and hit off a mat into my garage. As late as 
midnight I've done that. So-- 
 
Q: Is the net still there? 
 
A: I'm sure it's hanging around somewhere, because I've bought 
new nets. I've bought two new nets, I know, in the last--since I'd 
gotten back home that time, I had bought two new nets to put in 
various places on my property. 
 
Q: What nets were up at the property on June 12? 
 
A: They weren't up. It was something you would have to hang. 
 
Q: You had nets, but they were not hanging on June 12. Is that 
what you're saying? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where were the nets? 
 
A: I don't know. Probably around my garage somewhere. 
 
Q: When was the last time you hung those nets to use them before 
June 12? 
 
A: Sometime in May I may have done it in my backyard. 
 
Q: Do you have a specific recollection of doing it in May? 
 
A: No. But since it's something that I've done so much over the last 
10 years, I'm sure I must have, you know. 
 
Q: When you hit into the net, you're not hitting the balls off the 
property. Right? You're n hitting them into the net. Correct? 
 
A: Yeah, but normally I would take one or two because I want to 
do something, hit them somewhere. yeah. 
 
Q: Do you have a specific recollection in June, prior to June 12, of 
hitting golf balls at night? 
 
A: Not in June. Not in June, I don't, no. 
 
Q: Do you have a specific recollection of hitting golf balls at night

Q: And do you have a specific recollection of hitting golf balls at 
night from your property in April of 1994? 
 
A: I was never in L A. in April. 
 
Q: In March of 1994? 
 
A: When you say "specific," I don't know the specific day, but I 
know I did in March. I know for sure I did on numerous occasions. 
 
Q: Did you ever do so with another person? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you identify a single person-- 
 
A: Well, no, that's wrong. Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Who? 
 
A: Justin. 
 
Q: Your-- 
 
A: My son. 
 
Q:--younger boy? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: He was with you on one occasion when you were hitting golf

A: He's been with me on numerous occasions when I've done that, 
yes. 
 
Q: When was the last time? 
 
A: I don't recall--last time? 
 
Q: Withdrawn. When was the last time before June 12, 1994 that 
Justin was with you at night at Rockingham hitting golf balls? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: And do you have a specific recollection that he was with you in 
June hitting golf balls at night? 
 
A: I told you I didn't think I hit any balls other than that night. 
 
Q: So maybe going back to March?

possibly, yes. 
 
Q: Did Justin also hit golf balls, too? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Off the property like you were doing? 
 
A: No. He's just gotten to the point where he can hit it on the 
property. 
 
Q: Were these situations where you were just hitting into the net or 
actually taking a couple and hitting them out? 
 
A: Well, yeah. Normally-- 
 
MR. BAKER: And you are talking about instances with-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: With Justin. 
 
MR. BAKER: Thank you. 
 
THE WITNESS: If he's hitting, because only one of us could hit 
into the net, I might drop a ball or two and chip it over the wall or 
chip it somewhere, yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And he saw you do that? 
 
A: I'm sure he did, yes. 
 
Q: Besides Justin, is there any other person who in 1994 before 
June 12 saw you hit golf balls from your property at night? 
 
A: What do you mean, from my property? 
 
Q: Hitting golf balls on your property like you said you were doing 
on June 12. 
 
A: I would imagine a housekeeper must have seen me. Nicole 
obviously seen me many times. I don't know. Whoever was 
around. Probably my housekeeper. Probably Michelle more than 
Gigi, but possibly Gigi. 
 
Q: Was there any other person besides Justin who ever participated 
in that with you? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
Q: Hitting golf balls at night at your property in the year 1994. 
 
A: Not that I recall, no. 
 
Q: Now, have you ever seen--Withdrawn. Do you know whether 
any of those golf balls that you said you were chipping around the 
yard were ever retrieved by anybody? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Who retrieved them? 
 
A: I believe LAPD. 
 
Q: How do you know that? 
 
A: Because I have a--some memory that I read a report that they 
did. 
 
Q: And have you ever seen those golf balls? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did LAPD ever bring them into the courtroom, or did anybody 
else ever bring them into the courtroom? 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Did you ever say to somebody, "Hey, get those golf balls for 
me; bring them to court"? 
 
A: For what? 
 
Q: Did you ever request that they be brought to court? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And what is this document where you read at the golf balls were 
retrieved from your property? 
 
A: In some form of discovery. 
 
Q: Do you know whether the golf balls that you read in this report 
that were retrieved from your property were the ones that you hit 
on the evening of June 12 as opposed to some prior occasion? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you hit Maxfli 100s on June 12 on your property? 
 
A: One might have been. They might have been. It was just the 
scuffed balls that I hit away. I just looking for scuffs more than 
anything. 
 
Q: When you were going into your golf bag, you said you picked 
out Maxfli 100s. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: I am talking about the bag of balls in the Bentley trunk. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So I take it all these balls, then, were Maxfli 100s. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You also picked out other balls as well? 
 
A: I probably hit away some other balls, yes. 
 
Q: Were you picking out balls to hit in the yard that were not 
Maxfli 100s? 
 
A: I was picking balls out to take with me were Maxfli 100s. 
Whatever I grabbed to hit away were scuffed balls, and I just hit 
them away. 
 
Q: So you have no way then, of knowing whether these balls that 
you read about in the LAPD report are the actual balls you hit that 
night. Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask anybody to go look for those balls that you hit 
that evening on the property? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, the balls that you hit--Withdrawn. The club you used to 
hit those balls was the pitching wedge Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And was that wedge seized by the LAPD? 
 
A: I think at some point, yes 
 
Q: And did you get it back yet? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: When did you get that wedge back? 
 
A: I think when I was in jail. 
 
Q: They returned it to whom? 
 
A: To Rockingham, I assume. 
 
Q: All the clubs were returned? 
 
A: I never really checked to see, but I'm assuming, of that group of 
clubs, I'm assuming they were, yes. 
 
Q: Where is this pitching wedge now? 
 
A: I hope in my garage. 
 
Q: Have you used it since that evening when you hit golf balls on 
June 12, 1994? 
 
A: I might have. 
 
Q: Do you remember using it? 
 
A: I might have. I don't know. We hit a lot of balls in the front 
yard. So, I mean, I grab a club; some of my security; I grab a club; 
even some of my lawyers have grabbed a club. So, you know... 
 
Q: You are saying since you were-- 
 
A: Even some of my lawyers have taken some clubs. 
 
MR. BAKER: We don't need to put this on the record. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let the record reflect that the witness looked 
towards the general direction of Mr. Baker. 
 
Q: Have you hit any golf balls at night from the Rocking---at your 
Rockingham property since you were released from jail? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And have you done so with other persons? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: Security. And I don't know if you guys were around. Whoever 
was around. 
 
Q: How many times did you do that? 
 
A: How many times I've done it since I've been back? 
 
Q: Since you got out of jail, at night at Rockingham, 10:00 o'clock. 
 
A: Oh, Jesus, 10:00 o'clock-- 
 
Q: 9:00,10:00 o'clock or later. 
 
A: After dark. 
 
Q: After dark. 
 
A: After dark, three or four times. 
 
Q: And every time was with someone else? 
 
A: Well, every time somebody was there. I mean, I have security 
there that's full time now. A few times they were there. 
 
Q: And they saw you do it? 
 
A: Oh, yeah. 
 
Q: Who were the security personnel? 
 
A: I can't give you any last names, but Thomas, Jeff, Dave. 
 
Q: Who were the lawyers? 
 
A: Phil Baker, Bob Baker. Bob Blasier, I'm not sure. 
 
Q: Did the lawyers also swing the clubs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And were you-- 
 
A: Not all the time. You're talking on at least one occasion or 
something. 
 
Q: Were any of these incidents when you hit golf balls from 
Rockingham, after you got out of jail, for the purpose of 
demonstrating what you were doing on the evening of June 12? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, you can talk about--don't answer that 
question, but you can talk about anything other than any 
demonstrations that your lawyers had you do. 
 
THE WITNESS: After dark, no. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: But before dark, yes? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, don't answer that question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You want to answer that? 
 
MR. BAKER: No, he not going to answer that 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think what he does, Mr. Baker, is not a 
communication--demonstrations are not protected, but I am not 
going to convince you, I can see. 
 
MR. BAKER: No, you're not. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We will just have to take it to the judge. 
 
MR. BAKER: Fair enough. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
Q: I would like to show you some photographs, which I would like 
to mark--I guess we will start with Exhibit 22. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 22 was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I will have to make copies. 
 
Q: I would like to show you what I will mark as Exhibit 22, a 
photograph of--a photograph. 
 
Hold on for a second, Mr. Simpson. 
 
(Pause in the proceedings.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson, now that the lawyers have seen this, let me show 
you Exhibit 22. What is that a picture of? 
 
A: A golf bag. 
 
Q: Is that the golf bag that you took to Chicago on June 12? 
 
A: It appears to be, yes. 
 
Q: And does this contain the clubs that you had recently received 
from Callaway about a month before? 
 
A: I really can't tell, but they--I see one or two of the clubs look 
like Callaway Big Bertha irons, and that would be the type of irons 
that I had. 
 
Q: This was a new set of irons you had gotten? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Were the woods new also? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And the putter? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you took this--it was a Swiss Army golf bag. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that made by the Forschner Company? 
 
A: I doubt it. 
 
Q: Have anything to do with Forschner? 
 
A: Well, Swiss Army is. 
 
Q: Is that something that is placed on the bag? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: Oh, I see. When you went to Chicago, you put this bag in what 
you called a cover bag. Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Was this the -Had you used these clubs earlier on the day of 
June 12? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: This exact set of clubs? 
 
A: Well, if that's the clubs. yes 
 
Q: And had you used them the day before, on June 11th? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you used them, you went to play locally at Riviera 
correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Both on June 11 and June 12 Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: When you used them on those occasions, you did not have a 
black --excuse me--you didn't have a cover bag. Correct? 
 
A: Didn't have a travel bag, no. 
 
Q: Where was your cover bag? 
 
A: In the entry of my house. 
 
Q: Kept there on June 11 and June 12? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: What car did you use to drive to the golf course on June 11? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What are the choices? 
 
A: Bentley or Bronco. 
 
Q: You don't remember which one you used? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did you use on June 12? 
 
A: Bronco. 
 
Q: Where were you--Strike that. Where did you put this golf bag 
with all the clubs in it into the cover bag? 
 
MR. BAKER: The location where he was when he inserted it? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Correct. 
 
THE WITNESS: In front of my house or at the entry portion of my 
house. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You took the golf clubs to the entryway of your house? 
 
A: Yeah, at the entry, and then the cover was still there because I 
had taken it off Saturday morning there. 
 
Q: The entryway was inside the house. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On the floor? 
 
A: That--yeah. 
 
Q: In a closet? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Just lying there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Just on the other side of the front door? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: If you opened the front door, would it hit the golf cover bag? 
 
A: If it spread out, maybe, but I don't think it was then. It was to 
the-facing the front door, to the left. 
 
Q: Against the wall? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. And you took your golf clubs inside the house and put 
the cover bag on? 
 
A: I don't think so. I think I brought the cover bag out. 
 
Q: Right outside the front door? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In the entry--What do you call that area right outside the front 
door? 
 
A: My entry. Front--not the foyer, but the entry. 
 
Q: You put the cover bag on at that time. Right? Or at that 
location, I should say. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What time was that? 
 
A: That was between--that was before I went to McDonald's, so 
that would have been before 9:00 o'clock. 
 
Q: When you put the cover bag over the golf clubs, did the cover 
bag also have another pair of shoes in it? 
 
A: It may have. Or the golf bag may have had a pair of shoes in it. 
 
Q: This golf bag had a pair of shoes in it? 
 
A: It could have. I'm not sure right now. I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you put another pair of shoes in the cover bag? 
 
A: Another pair of shoes ended up in the cover bag. I didn't 
specifically put them in the cover bag, but at some point obviously 
I had, but there was definitely a pair of shoes in the outer cover 
bag, yes. 
 
Q: When did you put those shoes in he outer cover bag? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did you do it on the evening of June 12? 
 
A: I went to make sure that they were in there on the evening of 
June 12, and they were. 
 
Q: When you took the cover bag off two or three days before, were 
the shoes in the cover bag from your prior trip? 
 
A: They could have been, because I did take them with me on the 
prior trip. 
 
Q: You don't remember one way or the other? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did this bag have a place where you could put the shoes 
and the shoe bag? 
 
A: If I wanted to, yes. 
 
Q: And where was that? Can you point to it? 
 
A: This zipper that comes down, it could have gone in right there 
(Indicating). 
 
Q: Under where it says "Swiss Army"? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when you put the golf bag into the cover bag shortly 
before you went to McDonald's--is that what you said? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Around 9:00 p.m.? 
 
A: Well, before I went, yes. 
 
Q: Shortly before you went? A: I don't know about shortly, but 
sometime before I went, yes. 
 
Q: What time was it? 
 
A: I don't know. It was sometime between 7:00 and 9:00. 
 
Q: You can't fix it any closer than that? 
 
A: Cannot fix it any closer than that. 
 
Q: So any time between 7:00 and 9:00 o'clock is when you put the 
golf bag into the cover bag. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And when you did that, what did you do with the cover bag that 
had the golf clubs in it? 
 
A: Put them on my bench. 
 
Q: Outside the front door? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And it stayed there? 
 
A: Yes. For a while. 
 
Q: For a while. 
 
A: Yeah. Till we took them off the bench. 
 
Q: To go into the limousine. 
 
A: No. A little bit before I went into the limousine. 
 
Q: But once you closed up that cover bag between 7:00 and 9:00 
o'clock, you never opened it again. Correct? 
 
A: Incorrect. 
 
Q: Why did you open it? 
 
A: I wanted to make sure I had my black shoes in there. 
 
Q: Golf shoes? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And were they in there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And are those the shoes in the coverbag or the shoes in the 
golfbag? 
 
A: Cover bag. 
 
Q: So you opened it one time, looked in the coverbag, saw the 
shoes, closed it, and then you did not open it again. Correct? 
 
A: Until when? 
 
Q: Until you got to Chicago. 
 
A: No, that's not correct. 
 
Q: Until you got into the limousine. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Okay. Focusing up until the time when you left the Rockingham 
property in the limousine on June 12, you did not open that cover 
bag again after you looked and checked for the black shoes. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when was it that you looked and checked for the black 
shoes? 
 
A: Somewhere around 11:00 o'clock or-somewhere around 11:00 
o'clock. That's a guess. 
 
Q: That's your best guess? 
 
A: Yeah. Shortly before I left to go-before we drove out of my 
driveway. 
 
Q: When you looked for the shoes, was the limo already there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And it was past the gate? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: It was still on the other side of the gate? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 23 was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Let me show you what has been marked as Exhibit 23. 
 
Mr. Simpson, I am showing you a photograph marked as Exhibit 
23. Can you identify what is in that photograph? 
 
A: It appears to be a Swiss Army cover travel bag. 
 
Q: And is that the travel bag that you have been referring to? 
Excuse me. Is that the bag you've been referring to so far as a 
"cover bag"? 
 
A: One like this, yes. 
 
Q: Is that the exact one? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Does it look like it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That's the bag that you just testified about. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: Bag that he just testified about? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Cover bag. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, I believe so. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Now, pointing to this cover bag, where do you open the zipper 
to look for the shoes? Or where did you open the zipper to look for 
the shoes? 
 
A: I really can't make it out here. Wherever you open the zipper to 
put the clubs in is the zipper that I opened to look for the shoes. 
 
Q: There is another compartment in there for the shoes? There is 
another compartment inside the coverbag-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: --for the shoes? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Just lying loose in there? 
 
A: Yeah, lying loose. 
 
Q: Is that a blue cover bag? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What color is it? 
 
A: Black. 
 
Q: And the golf bag is black, too. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Let me show you the next photograph, which I will mark as 
Exhibit 24. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 24 was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you recognize what is depicted in that photograph? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What is that? 
 
A: A Louis Vuitton travel bag-- 
 
Q: And that was--Excuse me. I'm sorry. 
 
A: Suitcase. 
 
Q: Is that the Louis Vuitton suitcase that you took to Chicago? 
 
A: One like this. Possibly this could be it. 
 
Q: And that's the--When you went to Chicago, you've already said 
you didn't have your new suit in there. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: He didn't say it was new. He said he didn't have a 
suit in there. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are correct. 
 
Q: You did not have your suit in there. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Was it a new suit? 
 
A: All my clothes are relatively new, yes. 
 
Q: What was in this Louis Vuitton bag when you went to Chicago? 
 
A: Couple of golf outfits, maybe a T-shirt or two, some underwear. 
maybe a pair of shoes-- 
 
Q: Dress shoes? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. I'm not a hundred percent sure if I didn't try to 
double up the shoes I was wearing as dress shoes. 
 
Q: Anything else? 
 
A: That would be about it. 
 
Q: And everything that you went to Chicago with you came back 
with in the Louis Vuitton bag except that you also added the suit? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And also the garment bag in which the suit was located? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Okay. Did you come back with the same clothes that you went 
to Chicago on? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: You mean was he wearing the same clothes? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Withdrawn. 
 
Q: Were you wearing the same clothes back to Chicago that--back 
to Los Angeles that you had worn to Chicago? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Wearing different clothes? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you wear to Chicago on the evening of June 12? 
 
A: I believe some jeans, white shirt and jean jacket, and I may have 
had a windbreaker with me. Not a windbreaker, but a wet jacket. 
 
Q: What were the -Were these stone-washed jeans? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was the -who was the manufacturer? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Were they Guess? jeans? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What kind of jeans do you usually wear? 
 
A: All kinds. 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: I do remember. 
 
Q: What jeans they were? 
 
A: All kinds of jeans I have in my home. 
 
Q: You don't remember what particular style this was? 
 
A: No. No. No, I don't. 
 
Q: Did you have any socks on? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: What kind of shoes did you have on? 
 
A: Some loafers. 
 
Q: What color were they? 
 
A: Black or blue. 
 
Q: What size were they? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Which size did you wear in 1994? 
 
MR. BAKER: We've been through the size. You asked that 
yesterday. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No, I never asked that. 
 
MR. BAKER: You never asked the size shoes he has? 
 
MR. MEDVENE: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: It's no big deal. I will let him answer, anyway. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me rephrase --or reask the question. 
 
Q: In June of 1994 what size shoes did you wear? 
 
A: Depends what shoe I was wearing. I could wear 12s, 11-1/2s, 
some 13s. 
 
Q: What size shoes--what type of shoes did you wear in size 12? 
 
A: Depends on the shoe make and the shoe. 
 
Q: What size--what type and make of shoes did you own at that 
time in size 12? 
 
A: Loafers. I would imagine some loafers were 12s, some tie-ups 
and tennis shoes. 
 
Q: Were most of your shoes that you owned in June of 1994 size 
12? 
 
A: I would say so, yes. 
 
Q: And you also said you had some size 11-1/2s? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What shoes did you have of that size in June of 1994? 
 
A: Probably tennis shoes and one or two pairs of loafers. 
 
Q: Are these shoes gifts to you, these 11-1/2s? 
 
A: Not necessarily, no. 
 
Q: Why did you have some 11-1/2s? 
 
A: Because that's what they were. 
 
Q: You tried them on-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:--and you bought them? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And they fit? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: These particular tennis shoes and one or two loafers. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: What was the width of your shoe size-- 
 
A: I don't know.

Q: What color was it? 
 
A: Blue. Stone-washed blue.

me also, yes. 
 
Q: That you carried with you? 
 
A: I can't recall if I put it in the bag or carried it with me, but I had 
sort of a golf wet jacket with me. 
 
Q: A windbreaker, you said earlier? 
 
A: Yeah. Yeah. It's a golf jacket. Windbreaker's a description. 
There was another thing that was a windbreaker, Hertz 
windbreaker. 
 
Q: And what was the color of that jacket? 
 
A: Blue or green. 
 
Q: Did I show you a picture of that jacket earlier today? 
 
A: Could have been. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me, Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. BAKER: Which jacket are we talking about? He's got the 
windbreaker and Hertz jacket. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to get it out right now. 
 
MR. BAKER: Thank you. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I need to find the original. 
 
MR. BAKER: It's 10, I think. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Might be 10. Yeah. One second. 
 
Q: Let me show you what has been previously marked as Exhibit 
10, a photograph of a jacket. Is that the jacket you took? 
 
A: It could have been. 
 
Q: And did you carry it, or did you have it in the Louis Vuitton bag 
or someplace else? 
 
A: It wouldn't have been in the Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
Q: So if it wasn't--you were not carrying it in your hand, in which 
bag would this jacket have been? 
 
A: I could have carried it, and I could have just slid it into the suit 
bag that I had. 
 
Q: With the suit? 
 
A: With the suit, yeah. Just, you know, unzip it, lay it in there and 
zip it up. 
 
Q: In that suit bag there was surely a suit. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Pants and matching jacket? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On a wooden hanger? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And anything else in that bag besides the possibility of this 
windbreaker? 
 
A: Shirt and tie. 
 
Q: Shirt and tie. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Anything else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What is your best recollection: That you carried the 
windbreaker or you packed it? 
 
A: I don't know. I really don't. I didn't pack it then, but I could 
have thrown it in there, you know. I could have just laid it in there 
so I wouldn't have to carry it on the airplane. 
 
Q: When you said you didn't "pack it then," what did you mean by 
"then"? 
 
A: Well, you're talking about packing the Louis Vuitton bag. I 
packed the Louis Vuitton bag in my home, and I didn't have it up 
in my home when I was packing the Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
Q: Where was it? 
 
A: In my Bronco. 
 
Q: That windbreaker was in your Bronco? 
 
A: I believe so, if that was the one, yes. 
 
Q: And you were packing the Louis Vuitton bag in your bedroom. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you wear the windbreaker that day playing golf? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: The day before? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What time did you pack the Louis Vuitton bag? 
 
A: I would say right up to almost 11:00 o'clock. 
 
Q: When did you start packing it? 
 
A: Technically? 
 
Q: What does that mean? 
 
A: Technically, I put something in it. First time I put something in 
it, somewhere between 8:00 and--somewhere between 7:30 or so 
and 9:00 o'clock. 
 
Q: Where was the Louis Vuitton bag in your home before you 
began to pack? 
 
A: In my closet in my bedroom. 
 
Q: When you took it out of your closet, what time was it? 
 
A: After 10:00 o'clock. 
 
Q: What is your best estimate after 10:00 o 'clock what time it was 
when you took the Louis Vuitton bag out of the closet? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: When you took that bag out of your closet, you then put it on 
your bed? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you opened it up? 
 
A: No. It was open. 
 
Q: It was open in the closet. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And there was nothing in it. Correct? 
 
A: I think some underwear and some socks. 
 
Q: From a prior trip? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When did the underwear and the socks get into the Louis 
Vuitton bag when it was open in the closet? 
 
A: Somewhere between 7:30 and 9 o'clock. 
 
Q: And-- 
 
A: That's a guess. 
 
Q: What is your best estimate of the time when--Back up. When 
did the socks and underwear go into the Louis Vuitton bag? 
 
MR. BAKER: He just answered that question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Is that right? 
 
THE WITNESS: Somewhere between 7:30 and 9:00 o'clock. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And when you put the socks and underwear into the Louis 
Vuitton bag from where did you retrieve the bag? 
 
A: From my closet. 
 
Q: And it was open in the closet? 
 
A: I opened it in the closet, yes. 
 
Q: You can pack in your closet. Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: You can bowl in your closet. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You have to understand, I have one of those 
little closets where it's about eight inches deep, you know. 
 
MR. BAKER: But you're a mere mortal. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: So you have a walk-in closet. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Off of your bedroom. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: At some time between 7:30 and 9:00 you went into your closet, 
and you picked up the bag from the floor? 
 
A: No. From a shelf. 
 
Q: From a shelf. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the bag was empty at that time. Correct? 
 
A: I'm not so sure of that. 
 
Q: What was in it? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you have any--do you have reason to believe that it was not 
empty? 
 
A: It could have not been empty, yes. 
 
Q: What could have been in it? 
 
A: Dirty clothes. 
 
Q: Did you take the dirty clothes out? 
 
A: If they were in there? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where did you put them, if you did so? 
 
A: In my hamper. 
 
Q: Where is your hamper? 
 
A: In my bathroom. 
 
Q: Next to the closet? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Now, do you have a place in your closet where you pack, lay 
the bag out, open and pack? 
 
A: Not always, but sometimes, yes. 
 
Q: On this occasion did you pack in the closet? 
 
A: Partially, yes. 
 
Q: And what location in the closet? 
 
A: On the floor. 
 
Q: You laid the bag down on the floor. Correct? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: If there were dirty clothes, you took those out and put them in 
the hamper in the bathroom. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Then you went and took some socks and underwear and put 
them into the bag. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many pairs of socks? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: How many pairs of underwear? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You were only packing for one or two nights. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And after you put the socks and underwear in the Louis Vuitton 
bag, did you leave the bag there on the floor? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then did you resume packing at a later time? 
 
A: Some more packing, yes. 
 
Q: After you put the socks and underwear, did you leave for a 
while? 
 
A: I don't know if it was directly after I put the socks and 
underwear, but obviously I came downstairs again, yes. 
 
Q: So after the socks and underwear were in the Louis Vuitton bag, 
you came downstairs for a while. Right? 
 
A: At some point after, yes, after I put them in there, yes. 
 
Q: And then at some point after 10:00 o'clock p.m., you went back 
to the closet in the bedroom-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --and resumed packing. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And where did you continue packing? 
 
A: I took the Louis Vuitton out of the -out of there, put it on my 
bed. 
 
Q: Okay. And what did you then put into the Louis Vuitton bag on 
your bed? 
 
A: Two golf outfits. 
 
Q: "Two golf outfits," meaning-- 
 
A: One and then--yeah, eventually two golf outfits, yes. Two golf 
outfits. 
 
Q: Well, did you pack both of the golf outfits in the Louis Vuitton 
bag at the same time? 
 
Did you go to your drawers and pull out two shirts and two pants-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: --and take them to the thing? What did do you? 
 
A: I just looked at what outfits I had hanging there, and one outfit I 
knew I was taking, and the other outfit I kind of made a last-minute 
decision. 
 
Q: And what outfit did you know you were taking? 
 
A: Just basic outfit with a Hertz-with a white shirt, black pants, and 
then I decided to bring a yellow shirt just in case for the Hertz 
thing. 
 
Q: So the white shirt and black pants you put into the Louis 
Vuitton bag first when you began repacking after 10:00 o'clock 
p.m. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you then put into the bag next after the white shirt 
and black pants? 
 
A: I laid a yellow shirt in there. 
 
Q: A yellow shirt. A golf shirt? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, did you do this right after you put in the white shirt and 
black pants, or was there a gap? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You didn't leave the bedroom, though. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, what did you put in after the yellow shirt? 
 
A: Maybe a T-shirt. 
 
Q: White T-shirt? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: An undershirt? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And then what? 
 
A: Not much else. 
 
Q: And then you closed the bag up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then did you fold it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And left it on the bed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did you do? 
 
A: Brought it downstairs. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: To the front of the house. 
 
Q: And laid it where? 
 
A: Well, he put it in the car the minute I brought it out. 
 
Q: When you started resuming your packing at 10 -sometime after 
10:00 o'clock p.m., was the limo driver there yet? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you started to pack as you've just described, starting with 
the white shirt and black pants, the limo driver was already there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, when you came down the stairs, did you carry that 
bag down yourself? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you carry anything else down? 
 
A: At that point, maybe my grip. 
 
Q: Your grip was up in your bedroom too? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you then do? 
 
A: Walked out front. 
 
Q: And what did you do next? 
 
A: Put them on the ground. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: Front of my house. 
 
Q: Was the car there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So you came down the steps-- 
 
MR. BAKER: You mean the limo-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The limo. I'm sorry. 
 
MR. BAKER-when you say he talked about a car? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The limo. 
 
Q: Was the limo there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You came down the steps. The front door was open or closed? 
 
A: I believe it was open at that point. 
 
Q: Who opened it? 
 
A: Me. 
 
Q: And was it open the entire time you were packing upstairs? 
 
A: What do you mean by "entire time"? 
 
MR. BAKER: He means from 7:30 till approximately 11:00. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When you took the Louis Vuitton bag out of the closet and put 
it on the bed and started to put in the white shirt and black pants 
and then the yellow shirt and then the T-shirt, you said that the 
limo driver was already there. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Now, my question to you is: Was the door open during that 
period of time? 
 
A: Not when I first took it out, no. 
 
Q: When you first took the Louis Vuitton bag out of the closet and 
put it on the bed-- 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --the front door was open or closed? 
 
A: Closed. 
 
Q: Then you put in the white shirt and black pants and yellow shirt 
and T-shirt. 
 
When did you open the front door? When you came down with the 
bag? 
 
A: What bag? 
 
Q: The Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
A: No. Well, I may have opened it. If it was closed again, I would 
have opened it, yes. 
 
Q: Was the door open or closed when you came downstairs? 
 
A: At that particular time? 
 
Q: To put the bag in the car. 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you make another trip downstairs to open the door? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
Q: During the time that you were packing this Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
A: I had just been downstairs a few minutes before. 
 
Q: Are you saying that while you were packing this Louis Vuitton 
bag as it was on your bed, you made a trip downstairs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Before or after you completed packing these items? 
 
A: Before. 
 
Q: You had started to put in these shirts and pants? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But not completed? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: You had put in the white shirt and black pants and then 
stopped? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you went downstairs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you opened the door? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then what did you do? 
 
A: I looked in my golf bag. 
 
Q: To see if your-- 
 
A: Black shoes were there. 
 
Q: And they were. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you went upstairs? 
 
A: After I laid it off the bench onto the ground and left my suitbag 
there, then I went upstairs. 
 
Q: Your golf bag was inside the house. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Previously you testified that it was inside the door. 
 
MR. BAKER: No, he did not. 
 
THE WITNESS: That's not correct. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: It was outside. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: You opened the door, it was outside, you looked into it, you left 
the door open and then took your suit bag out also and put it 
outside? 
 
MR. BAKER: Let me have that question read back, please. 
 
(Pending question read.) 
 
MR. BAKER: That's compound. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, let me reask it. 
 
Q: You just said you came down, opened the door. The golfbag, 
which was already in the cover bag-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:--was outside on the ground. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: On the bench. 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: Which is outside the door. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you opened it up, looked in -- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: and saw your shoes there. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you zippered it back up. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you went inside. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you do anything else before you went upstairs? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. So you left the door open? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: And you went upstairs. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you resumed packing the Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Put in the yellow shirt and the T-shirt. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Zipped it up-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -and then came back downstairs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And out? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when you came out the door, what did you then do? 
 
A: I put the bags down, I looked into my grip-- 
 
Q: Put what bags down? 
 
A: Louis Vuitton and my grip. And I looked in my grip, and I was 
looking for a few things, and I guess I started a conversation with 
Kato maybe right then or maybe a little later, but Kato was saying 
something. 
 
Q: I want to be clear about these bags. When you came downstairs, 
you were carrying your grip and your Louis Vuitton bag. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the door was open or closed; you don't remember. Correct? 
 
A: No. No, I don't remember. 
 
Q: Then you came out that door, and you are carrying now two 
bags. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And is your golf bag still on the bench? 
 
A: I think at that point they had already put it in the trunk of the 
car. 
 
Q: And then you went--What did you do with your two bags? 
 
A: Put them right down on the ground right there. 
 
Q: Right there next to the bench? 
 
A: Well, between the benches, yeah. Between the benches is what 
that area is, yes. 
 
Q: Between the two benches. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: There is one on either side. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You dropped the bags down. Did someone come and take 
them? 
 
A: They grabbed -one of them grabbed the Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
Q: One of whom? 
 
A: Kato or Alan Park. 
 
Q: The limo driver. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And put that where? 
 
A: They were putting it in the trunk of the car. 
 
Q: And you then looked into your grip, you said? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what were you looking for? 
 
A: Whatever I might have forgotten, make sure I had everything. 
 
Q: And did you forget anything? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What had you forgotten? 
 
A: My cell phone or the parts -other parts of my cell phone. 
 
Q: You mean the battery packs? 
 
A: Yeah. I carry--it comes in a case, and it has another battery and 
it has a plug-in for a car, and it--what else does it have. A card for 
all the--you know, just a bunch of stuff. It's a nice little case. 
 
Q: Are we talking about the cell phone that I showed you earlier? 
 
A: Yeah, one like that. 
 
Q: Are we talking about Exhibit 7? 
 
A: Yeah, one like that. 
 
Q: Now, when you looked in your grip, the cell phone was not in 
it? 
 
A: I don't think so, but it could have, but I know the rest of it 
wasn't in there. 
 
Q: Meaning the case with the cord? 
 
A: The case with the cord with the other battery wasn't in there. 
 
Q: There was already a battery on the phone itse3f. Right? 
 
A: There's a battery on the phone. There's a charger that's not on 
the phone, there's another battery that's not on the phone, and then 
there is a cord that you can use for a cigarette lighter, and mine 
comes in a nice little case. 
 
Q: Missing from the grip were the charger, the battery, the cord, all 
of which would be contained-- 
 
A: Together. 
 
Q:--in the case. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What color is that case? 
 
A: Black. 
 
Q: Where is that case normally kept? 
 
A: There is no real normal place. Normally with me. If I'm 
traveling, it's normally with me in grip. 
 
Q: And when you are not traveling, where did you keep the case at 
that time? 
 
A: No particular place. 
 
Q: Did you keep it in the car? 
 
A: Well, sometimes if I got in the car and the case was--and I had 
the case, I'd take it out of the thing and plug it into the car. 
Wherever I was. 
 
Q: So normally you kept the case in the grip, and the grip was with 
you? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did you take the grip with you to play golf that morning? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You left it home? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: I am talking about the morning of the 12th, of course. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you looked into the grip, did anybody see you doing that? 
 
A: It would have been hard for them not to. 
 
Q: That was in the area between the two benches. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you then did not see the case. Correct? 
 
A: Well, I can't recall even if I saw the phone at that point, but I 
know that those are two things that were --at least the case was 
missing. I can't recall right now if I saw the phone because I went 
in the house briefly, and I may have picked the phone up when I 
went in the house in the kitchen at that point, or the phone was 
there and then I came back out, and then, you know... 
 
Q: This is all while the limo driver is still there? 
 
A: Yeah. And Kato was walking around. 
 
Q: Now, you usually take the case with you on trips? 
 
A: Yes. That's what it is: A travel case. 
 
Q: And when you looked in your bag, was it your intention to see 
if the case was there and, if it was not there, to make sure you had 
it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What was your intention? 
 
A: Just to see if I had everything. 
 
Q: When you saw that the case was missing, you decided you 
wanted to get it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You wanted to bring the case with you. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the phone. Correct? 
 
A: Of course. 
 
Q: And did you do so? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You brought the case and the phone? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And did you put the phone into the case? 
 
A: At some point, yes. 
 
Q: Did you do that before you got into the limo? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: And did you then go retrieve the case someplace? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where did you go get the case? 
 
A: In the Bronco. 
 
Q: Where in the Bronco was the case? 
 
A: On the seat, on the other seat in the Bronco. 
 
Q: On the passenger seat? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Just sitting there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that where you normally keep it? 
 
A: It depends. 
 
Q: Is that where you used to keep it at the time? 
 
A: Just depends. 
 
Q: Depends on what? 
 
A: Depends on where I put it down. 
 
Q: So you don't have a regular habit -- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: -of putting it in a particular place in the Bronco. Is that what 
you're saying? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you use that case that day? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
Q: Did you use the battery, the cord or the charger? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you went out to--Where was the Bronco when you went 
to get the case? 
 
A: On Rockingham. 
 
Q: And you went out to Rockingham to get-to the Bronco to get 
the case? A: Correct. 
 
Q: Was the limo driver in the car waiting for you while you were 
doing this? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: He had already put in the Louis Vuitton and the golf clubs in 
the trunk. Right? 
 
A: And I assume my suit bag, because I told him, "Don't smash my 
suit bag." 
 
Q: You didn't mention coming downstairs with the suit bag. When 
did the suit bag get downstairs? 
 
A: First of all, you're incorrect. 
 
Q: I may be. I may not be. Just tell me when the suit bag came 
downstairs. 
 
A: When I came down to look in my golf bag for my shoes. 
 
Q: You brought the suit bag with you? 
 
A: Yes, because I knew I couldn't carry all three of them at once. 
 
Q: Where did you leave the suit bag? 
 
A: Right out front with my golf bag. 
 
Q: On top of the golf bag on the bench? 
 
A: No, because I put my golf bag on the ground, so--and I could 
have put the suit bag on top of it or I could have just folded it right 
there on the ground and then looked in my golf bag and then throw 
my golf bag on the ground. 
 
Q: So in any event, when you went off to get your phone case, the 
suit bag, the Louis Vuitton bag and the golf bag were all in the 
trunk. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. Mr. Grornan needs to leave now. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 3:27. 
 
(Arthur Groman leaves the deposition.) 
 
(Pause in the proceedings.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 3:28. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: I think I asked you before. Let me ask you again. I'm not sure 
what the answer--I remember the answer. When you went to the 
Bronco to get the case, what was Alan Park doing? 
 
A: Standing around by the trunk of the car, I believe. 
 
Q: And you left your grip back on the floor between the two 
benches-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --on the ground? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you went out towards the Rockingham gate, how did you 
cause the gate to open? 
 
A: Push the button. 
 
Q: Right on the inside of the gate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Which side? 
 
A: Left side. 
 
Q: And the gate swings inward? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you go out the left side. Right? 
 
A: I don't know. Left side or the right side. 
 
Q: The box is on the left side, the gate starts to open, and then you 
exit. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you walked out to your car? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The Bronco. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you do? 
 
A: I looked in my car. 
 
Q: You looked through the window? 
 
A: No. I just opened the door. 
 
Q: Which door? 
 
A: The driver door. Looked in, saw the case, got--if that was the 
windbreaker, grabbed that--I mean the golf jacket, grabbed that. 
 
Q: You mean Exhibit 10? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And first of all, where was the phone? 
 
A: The phone, I'm not sure, but I think the phone was either in the 
bag or on my entry table, because I can't be sure if the phone was 
there or not. as I told you before. But the case wasn't. And then 
when I came back --yeah, then I grabbed the case and I grabbed the 
jacket. 
 
Q: The case was on the passenger seat. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: Did you open up the case right while you were in the Bronco to 
see what was in it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You looked around then for the jacket. Right? 
 
A: No. The jacket was laying right there in between the seats. 
 
Q: Between the front seat and the passenger seat? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: On the console? 
 
A: Partially on the passenger seat and the console, yes. 
 
Q: And you picked up the case; you picked up the jacket. Did you 
pick up anything else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you look for anything else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How were you able to see while you were doing that? 
 
A: Because I got eyes. 
 
Q: Was there any light in there? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: In the car? 
 
A: I would assume so, but there's certainly light from the 
intersection. 
 
Q: There was a light--The car was parked near the intersection? 
 
A: No. Yeah, I would say so. 20 feet, 30 feet from the intersection. 
 
Q: The intersection of what two streets? 
 
A: Ashford and Rockingham. 
 
Q: And where is there a streetlight there? 
 
A: Right in the middle of the intersection. 
 
Q: And you could see inside the Bronco from that streetlight? 
 
A: I would assume I could have seen inside the Bronco without 
that street light, but, yes, I could see clearly inside the Bronco for 
what I was looking for. 
 
Q: Was there any light on in the Bronco? 
 
A: Should have been. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because I think when you open the doors, lights come on the 
doors. 
 
Q: There are only lights on the doors? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't know. I don't really pay attention. When I 
open the door, my car's lights come on. 
 
Q: Whatever lights are usually on when you open the door came on 
that time, too? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Then you closed the door? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you lock it? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Do you have a--How do you lock your car when you leave it, 
the Bronco? 
 
A: Push a button, I think. 
 
Q: On a key? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: On the door panel? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where is that button? 
 
A: On the door panel. 
 
Q: Which door panel? 
 
A: Whichever door, I guess, I'm going in or out. 
 
Q: Did you press that button that night? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you lock the car? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Is that the only way you can lock the car: By pressing that 
button on the door panel? 
 
A: I don't know. You may be able to lock it with a key, but I'm not 
sure. 
 
Q: When you typically locked the Bronco in May-June 1994, how 
did you do so? 
 
A: I'm sure I would push that button. 
 
Q: You don't have one of those keys with the automatic lock on it, 
do you? 
 
A: As I already said. no. 
 
Q: Okay. And you closed the door? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how did you get back into the property? 
 
A: I think--I'm not sure. I'm not sure of this, but I think the gate 
had closed, and I used my key to open it, the gate. 
 
Q: There is a key on the outside of the gate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you key it, the gate automatically opens again? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When that gate automatically opens at Rockingham, then when 
you press the button on the inside, let's say, does it then close after 
a certain amount of time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What is that interval of time? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Roughly. 
 
A: 30, 40 seconds. 
 
Q: It opens, it stays open for 30, 40 seconds and then closes? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And is the same true of Ashford? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How does Ashford work? Or how did it work? 
 
A: How does it work. You can push it open if it's off the hinges, or 
you can push a button to open it to go out. There is no key you use 
to come in. 
 
Q: When you are on the outside-excuse me. When you want to go 
out of the Ashford entrance, there is a place where you can press 
the button to open up the gate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And is that on the left side also? 
 
MR. BAKER: As you are going out? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Yes, as you're going out. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you press that button, does the gate then--is the hinge on 
the left side, or is the hinge on the right side? 
 
A: No. It opens both ways 
 
Q: Oh, there's two--okay. Does it swing inside? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And does it also then automatically close? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: It stays open? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How does one close it? Manually? 
 
A: Yeah, or with--if you got a thing from the car. 
 
Q: Oh, like a remote control? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is there a remote control device for the closing and opening of 
the Rockingham gate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is it the same one for both gates? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you always kept one in the Bronco? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: In the car? 
 
A: Yeah. They kept getting ripped off by the kids and stuff, so, you 
know, you're always fighting to have one. 
 
Q: You mean the gate openers? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where did you keep them in the Bronco? 
 
A: Wherever. On the dash--I mean, on the dashboard; sometimes 
up there, but they were all broke; in the glove compartment; on the 
seat. 
 
Q: Do you have a separate one for the Bentley? 
 
A: Pardon me? 
 
Q: You have a separate clicker-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:--for these doors for the Bentley? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is it the same clicker that works the garage door? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Different one? 
 
A: I don't know if I really have one to work the garage door, but 
I'm sure at one point I did. 
 
Q: How do you open and close the garage door from the outside of 
the garage? 
 
A: I don't know if I in recent years ever have. 
 
Q: For example, when the door was open that evening, it was 
opened from the inside? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Does the outside of the Ashford gate, like the Rockingham gate, 
have a place for a key so that you can make the doors open? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So if you don't have one of those remote control gizmos, you're 
out of luck? 
 
A Yes. 
 
Q: You can't manually open them can you, by pushing them. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you close--You used the key on the outside of the 
Rockingham gate to get back in. Correct? 
 
A: I believe so. I'm not a hundred percent sure of that, but I believe 
so. 
 
Q: And then the door opened--the gate opened, I should say. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And then you walked into the gate and then into the car? 
 
A: I'm sorry? 
 
Q: You walked into the driveway on Rockingham and then to the 
limousine and then into the car? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where did you go? 
 
A: Kato was talking about some noise, and I talked to him out front 
and asked Park if he had a flashlight and told Kato to go in and 
look in the cupboard in my kitchen. 
 
Q: The front door was still open? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When Kato said this to you, were you near the front door? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
Q: In other words, you had walked in through the Rockingham 
gate and walked in the direction of the limousine. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when-- 
 
A: Well, to the direction of my front door, yes. 
 
Q: To the direction of your front door. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why were you walking to the front door and not to the 
limousine? 
 
A: Because my front door was open, and my bag was sitting there 
between the benches in front of my front door. 
 
Q: The grip bag. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you went to the grip bag, and what did you do then? 
 
A: I put the phone thing in the grip bag, and I put--that's what I did 
at that moment. 
 
Q: Did you put the jacket in the grip bag? 
 
A: I don't recall. I may have laid it across it. 
 
Q: "The phone thing" meaning the case. Right? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then at that point in time Kato came up to you and said 
something to you? 
 
A: Kato had been talking to me even before I went out, and he was 
continuing to talk again when I came back in. 
 
Q: He mentioned something at that moment in time about sounds? 
 
A: I think he was talking about it all the time, but I'm not sure. 
 
Q: Including that time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you then asked Mr. Park if he had a flashlight? 
 
A: When I was coming back in, I said, "Does he have"--I may have 
said it to Kato and Kato may have said no, and then I know during 
the course of whatever--I was just trying to pack and leave. 
 
Q: I want to go back here. When you were coming back to the grip 
bag, your purpose was to put the items in the grip bag or in the car, 
close the door and get in the limo. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. And I had some other things, yes. 
 
Q:: You didn't have any further business to do in the house. Right? 
 
A: Except to close the door. 
 
Q: Except to close the door. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Which you closed from the outside. Correct? 
 
A: I would have, yes, but I didn't. 
 
Q: You had your keys with you. Right? 
 
A: Coming back, yes. 
 
Q: Because you used that to get in the Rockingham entrance 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: What key chain was that, by the way? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: How many keys were on it? 
 
A: Two or three. 
 
Q: What were those keys to? 
 
A: Probably my house, maybe my office, maybe my New York 
apartment I really don't know. I know my house for sure. 
 
Q: Are all of the keys to your Rockingham house that you have on 
a single key chain? 
 
MR. BAKER: You mean in 1994 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Correct. June of 1994. 
 
THE WITNESS: What do you mean? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: In other words, the key chain that had the key that you used get 
in the Rockingham gate-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:--that also had some other keys? 
 
A: I believe so, yeah. 
 
Q: Including the front door. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many keys to get into your front door are needed? 
 
A: One. 
 
Q: Is that the same key as the Rockingham gate key? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: They are keyed alike. Right? 
 
A: Pardon me? 
 
Q: Same key to use both? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Does that key operate any other exterior doors going to your 
home? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Which ones? 
 
A: My bedroom, my closet and every other lock that's in my house. 
 
Q: So all of the locks in your house, including interior locks, work 
off of one key? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that would include the exterior front door key and the 
Rockingham gate key? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: Did you have any other keys on that chain that had to do with 
the Rockingham property? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: What other keys did you have on there, if any? 
 
A: I don't know. I know there were other keys on there, but I don't 
know what they were for. 
 
Q: Is that where your car key to the Bronco is also? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: To the Bentley? 
 
A: Probably, yes. 
 
Q: The Bronco is on a separate-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --key chain of its own? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And is there anything else on that key chain? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you went to put the stuff in the case and close the door, 
you were--Kato was talking to you, you asked Park for a flashlight-
- 
 
A: Kato may have asked-- 
 
MR. BAKER: He hasn't finished, and it's compound, and I don't 
know what you mean about "the stuff" and -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me withdraw that question. 
 
Q: When you were going back to the front door to put the stuff that 
you were carrying, I guess the case, I should say, into the grip bag 
and to close the front door, you then encountered Kato and he was 
talking to you. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, Kato had been talking to me or I had been watching Kato 
talking or hearing him speak almost ever since I first walked out--
the second time I walked out the front door. 
 
Q: Now, when you saw Kato at that moment, did you then go back 
inside? 
 
A: What moment? 
 
Q: That moment when you returned from the Bronco. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where did you go inside the house? 
 
A: What did I do or where did I go? 
 
Q: Where did you go? 
 
A: I was on my way to the kitchen, and I went in the kitchen. 
 
Q: What did you do in the kitchen? 
 
A: Got a drink of water, basically. 
 
Q: And then you left? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you carry your grip bag in with you? 
 
A: No. I did carry a bag in with me but not the grip bag. 
 
Q: The grip bag was still on the floor outside between the two 
benches? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What bag did you carry into the house with you? 
 
A: A ball bag. 
 
Q: Where did that ball bag come from? 
 
A: It was on the ground outside. 
 
Q: Where outside? 
 
A: By where I was chipping balls behind my Bentley. 
 
Q: What was in that ball bag? 
 
A: Balls. 
 
Q: Anything else? 
 
A: Maybe -I don't know. Balls. Maybe a golf glove. 
 
Q: Golf glove? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And how did that bag with balls and a golf glove in it get on the 
ground near your Bentley? 
 
A: When I was picking balls out of the back of my Bentley for 
taking with me to Chicago and for chipping away, I dropped the 
bag. After I picked out, I dropped the bag on the ground. 
 
Q: And you just left it there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Why not? 
 
THE WITNESS:--I was doing other things. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Why did you leave the bag on the ground when you closed up 
your Bentley trunk and went inside? 
 
A: Because I was doing other things. 
 
Q: Did you just forget, you mean? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Had you not forgotten, you would have put the bag back into 
the trunk and closed the trunk? 
 
A: Possibly, yes. Possibly. 
 
Q: When did you pick up that bag to go inside the house? 
 
A: When I came back from the Bentley from getting my cell phone 
stuff. 
 
Q: Did you get the cell phone out of the Bentley? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: You just said "Bentley." You said getting the cell 
phone out of the Bentley. Did you mean-- 
 
THE WITNESS: Out of the Bronco. 
 
BY MR. BAKER: 
 
Q: Did you get the cell phone out of the Bronco? 
 
A: I got the stuff that goes with the cell phone out of the Bronco. 
 
Q: And the cell phone? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Just the case? 
 
A: Yeah, I believe just the case and the stuff and a jacket. 
 
Q: And a jacket. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So walking back from the Bronco you then picked up that ball 
bag? 
 
A: Picked up two bags. 
 
Q: What bags? 
 
A: The bag that I put the balls and a windbreaker in and the white 
bag that had nothing but balls in it. 
 
Q: So then when you were walking from the Bentley to the front 
door, you were carrying three things then, right-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --two bags and the case from the Bronco? 
 
A: Four things. 
 
Q: And the windbreaker. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then when you got to the front door area, what did you do 
with these four things? 
 
A: Three of them I sat down right there-- 
 
Q: What three? 
 
A: The cell phone I put in the bag, my grip and either laid the 
jacket there and the other bag. I asked Park to get my golf bag. I 
think he was in the process of getting my golf bag, which I don't 
think he knew was a golf bag because he seemed very confused, 
and Kato was talking about where for the flashlight and Juice, you 
know, "Show me where." 
 
So I kind of stopped what I was doing, and as I was walking back 
in the house to go show him to go into the cupboard, I had dropped 
the ball bag with all the bag--balls in it right there at the front door, 
and then I went into the kitchen and he went into the cupboard. 
 
Q: The ball bag that you dropped near the front door-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: --was the white ball bag-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --that you had accidentally left outside on the ground by the 
Bentley. Correct? 
 
A: I'm sorry. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Do you want to repeat that question, please. 
 
(Record read.) 
 
THE WITNESS: Your characterization of "accidentally"--yeah. I 
don't know if it was accidental or it was there. I didn't purposely do 
it, but it was still on my property. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: That's what I meant. You didn't purposely leave it on the 
ground. 
 
A: One way or the other. No. It was neither one way or the other. 
It's my house. It was there, yes. 
 
Q: The white bag. 
 
A: The white bag, yes. 
 
Q: With the balls in it. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many balls were in it? 
 
A: A whole bunch. 
 
Q: Scuffed or new or both? 
 
A: Scuffed, yeah. Used balls. 
 
Q: Used balls? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. And then you dropped that white bag at the door? 
 
A: Right inside the front door. 
 
Q: Inside the front door. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you had put your case and/or cell phone in the grip? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Left the grip outside still? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then gave this other bag which had balls and the 
windbreaker to Park. 
 
A: No. I left it there, but I wanted Park to give me my golf bag so 
that I could put this--the balls and stuff in my golf bag, but I got 
distracted because Kato was talking to me. 
 
Q: So before you went into the house to the kitchen, you left that 
other bluish-- 
 
A: I left them right there. 
 
Q: --bag right that had the windbreaker and the new balls-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --outside the front door. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And just dropped--just laid it down there. Right? 
 
A: Right with my grip, yeah. 
 
Q: Did you then before you entered the door tell Alan Park what to 
do with that bag? 
 
A: No. I was asking him--I was in the process of asking him to 
bring me my golf bag because I wanted to condense, but Kato was 
talking to me, so I just went in the house with Kato. 
 
Q: Did you ask Park to get the golf bag out of the trunk? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Did he do so? 
 
A: He was beginning to do it, but he seemed a little confused, 
because he was reaching, and I mentioned to him, "Don't smash 
my suit," and I don't know. You know, I didn't know him, so he 
just seemed a little confused. But Kato was talking. This was all 
happening at once. Kato was talking, so I just went inside with 
Kato. 
 
Q: When you went inside to the kitchen to get the drink of water-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: -did you have any bags with you? 
 
A: Not in the kitchen, no. 
 
Q: When you passed the front door and dropped down that white 
bag, at that point in time you had no further bags in your hand? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you were carrying nothing. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: You went into the kitchen; you got a drink of water. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: From the sink or from the refrigerator? Where did you get the 
water? 
 
A: From the washroom. 
 
Q: From the washroom. Is that near the kitchen? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where did you get the glass? 
 
A: From the kitchen. 
 
Q: And what did you do with the glass when you finished? 
 
A: Probably sat it right there. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: Either on the counter or in the sink. 
 
Q: Kitchen counter or kitchen sink? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: You said something about looking in the cupboard for a 
flashlight? 
 
A: Kato was looking in the cupboard for a flashlight. 
 
Q: And did you do anything more other than get a drink of water 
and walk out? 
 
A: Yeah. I wiped my hand. I saw what I thought was blood on my 
hand, and I tore a piece of tissue that was right there and wiped my 
hand, but I was talking to Kato at the same time. 
 
Q: And after you did that, did you then go to the car? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you went out to the car, you went out the front door 
now. Right? 
 
A: Actually I walked to the front door with Kato, and I was about 
to describe the alarm to him, but we were running late, so I just got 
in the car and told him I'd call him. 
 
MR. BAKER: The car we're speaking of is the limo? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The limo. 
 
THE WITNESS: The limousine . 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The limo. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When you came to the front door with Kato, did you begin 
explaining -- 
 
A: I was-- 
 
Q: Excuse me. -did you begin explaining to him about the alarm? 
 
A: I was talking to him about continuing to look because he--I 
wasn't really--it was the first time I really paid attention to what he 
was talking about. So I was talking about him to look further for 
the flashlight, but I was running late, and so I just went and got in 
the car. Talking to Kato--okay. 
 
Q: When you came out of the house, did Kato come out with you? 
 
A: Yeah, I think he was coming out the front door or standing in 
the entry when I got into the limo. 
 
Q: When you came out of the kitchen to go outside, was Kato 
walking with you? 
 
A: He was walking behind me. 
 
Q: Behind you. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you walked out of the front house-I'm sorry--the front 
door, he walked out behind you. Right? 
 
A: Well, he was behind me. I wasn't looking behind me. So he was 
behind me, yes. 
 
Q: Did you then turn to close the door? 
 
A: I didn't see him turn to close the door. 
 
Q: Did you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you close the door? 
 
A: No, 
 
Q: Did you lock the door? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You left it open? 
 
A: No. The door will lock if you close it. 
 
Q: Does it close automatically, or do you have to manually pull it 
closed? 
 
A: You'd have to I think manually pull it closed. 
 
Q: And it locks automatically? 
 
A: Yeah. It should. 
 
Q: And that's what you did. Right? 
 
A: No. I went and got in the car, Kato was behind me, and I 
thought I told him to look for a flashlight and see what's going on. 
 
Q: When you came out the door, you closed the door and it locked. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then-- 
 
A: No, I didn't close the door. Kato was behind me. I'm assuming 
Kato was going to close the door. 
 
Q: When you got in the car, was the door closed? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Were there any lights on there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Which lights? 
 
A: I would assume my coach lights on that were out front, and 
normally the lamps that I normally have on would have been on. 
 
Q: Where are those lamps? 
 
A: One's in the entry. One's in the kitchen. 
 
Q: Inside, you mean? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do they go on automatically? 
 
A: Then I don't know. I don't know. 
 
Q: Do you have any timers? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you have them activated that night? 
 
A: Some parts of the house. I don't know exactly what parts of the 
house they were, but some parts of the house there are. 
 
Q: Were the timers operating in June 12, 1994? 
 
A: I'm not sure. but I would think so, but I'm not sure. 
 
Q: When they are working, what time do the lights go on? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What time were they set for? 
 
A: I don't set them. I don't know. 
 
Q: Which lights were set on the timer? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Are the coach lights set on the timer? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, when you walked out the front door, did you then go right 
into the limousine? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you go into the back seat of the limousine? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was the limousine pointing towards Rockingham? 
 
A: Well, it was pointing south, yes. 
 
Q: And so you went in the seat right behind the driver. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that door was already open waiting for you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you got in, did you close the door? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Or did Park close the door? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Was Park already in the driver's seat? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Was the trunk closed? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And were the items that were outside put away? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where were they? 
 
A: Sitting right there. 
 
Q: Sitting right where? 
 
A: Between the benches. 
 
Q: And you were inside the limo. Right? 
 
A: You talking about when I walked out of the front door? 
 
Q: And you went into the limo. 
 
A: I grabbed those things and got into the limo. 
 
Q: What did you grab? 
 
A: Everything that was sitting between the benches. 
 
Q: What were those items? 
 
A: My grip, a little--the other bag, and I believe the windbreaker. 
 
Q: "The other bag"-- 
 
A: The jacket, yeah. 
 
Q: "The other bag" being the bag with the windbreaker and the golf 
balls? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And so Park never put that bag in the trunk? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you never had him take the golf bag out and put it into the 
golf bag? 
 
A: We never got to that, no. 
 
Q: But you had asked him to start to do that. Correct? 
 
A: No. I asked him to get me the golf bag, but Kato was distracting 
me, and so he never got to get me the golf bag. 
 
Q: When you came back out of the house, did he say, "Mr. 
Simpson, what do you want me to do with this golf bag?" 
 
A: No, he did not. 
 
Q: Did he say anything to you? 
 
A: No, except he was looking very nervous, and I said. "We better 
get going." 
 
Q: Did you tell--Did Mr. Kaelin pack any bags into the limousine? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: And Mr. Park, you said, put in the Louis Vuitton, the suit bag 
and the golf club. Right? 
 
A: I'm not sure. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: I think I dropped them, and I went back in the house, and I went 
out. When I went back in the house when I first came down-
secondly came down, they were in the limo. The second time I 
came down, my golf bag and my suit bag were in the limo already, 
so they were already put away. 
 
Q: And the Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
A: No. I came down with the Louis Vuitton bag, and during the 
process of doing that, I guess they were putting the other bag away, 
but I wasn't really paying attention to them. I was, you know, 
looking for what I was looking for. 
 
Q: Did you tell Mr. Park not to pack any particular--excuse me--
not to put any particular bag into the trunk? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or not to put it into the limo? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell that to Kaelin? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: At no time did you say to either Mr. Park or Mr. Kaelin not to 
handle a particular bag? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So you had in the back seat with you the windbreaker, the grip 
and the other bag? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: Do you have any explanation why the bags that were left 
outside on the area between the two benches when you went into 
the kitchen were not put into the limousine? 
 
MR. BAKER: He is not here to give you explanations. He is here 
to answer questions, and he doesn't have to give an explanadon, 
and I instruct him not to answer that question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you know why those bags were not put into the car? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell anybody not to put them in? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were you surprised when you came back out and saw that they 
were still there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because they didn't look like bags, I would think for me. I know 
what the bags are, so I'm influenced by it. One is a grip that I had 
all my personal things in. It was laying there open, and I was going 
in and out of it. And the other was a windbreaker, and I just 
assumed--I can't make an assumption for them, but it's--when I was 
looking at it, I pulled my ticket out to make sure my ticket was 
there, so maybe he just assumed it was my bag. I don't know. I 
don't know. 
 
Q: The windbreaker and the grip, but then there was another bag 
there. 
 
A: Yeah, but it was a little bag; it wasn't a big bag, and it was put 
with these two bags. So I don't know. You'd have to ask them. I 
can't think for them. 
 
Q: I am going to show you another photograph, which we will 
mark as Exhibit 25. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 25 was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Exhibit 25 is a photograph that shows a bag. Do you see that? 
 
A: Yes, 
 
Q: Do you recognize that bag? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What is it? 
 
A: It's my suit bag. 
 
Q: Is that the bag that you took to Chicago to carry the suit and the 
shirt and the tie? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you don't remember if the windbreaker was in there. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: What color is that bag, Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Black. 
 
Q: Did that bag have room to carry any more items in it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In other words, your Louis Vuitton bag was stuffed, or did it 
have room for additional items? 
 
A: I could have put more stuff in there, yes. 
 
Q: Let me show you the next exhibit, No. 26. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 26 was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: 26 contains another--is a photograph of another bag. Do you see 
that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Do you recognize that bag? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: What is it? 
 
A: It's a grip. 
 
Q: Is that the bag-- 
 
MR. KELLY: I am sorry. I couldn't hear you. 
 
THE WITNESS: Grip. 
 
MR. KELLY: A grip bag? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What color is that bag? 
 
A: It looks to be blue and sort of leatherish]. 
 
Q: Now, is that the bag that you took into the back seat with you 
that had the golf balls and the windbreaker? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: That's it? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Is there any uncertainty in your mind? 
 
A: Well, it wasn't one of my regular bags, so I'm assuming that was 
the bag. 
 
Q: This was one of your regular travel bag bags? 
 
A: Was not. 
 
Q: I am sorry. I missed your answer. 
 
"Well, it wasn't one of my regular bags, so I'm assuming that was 
the bag." 
 
Why were you assuming this is the bag that you took with you? 
 
A: Because it looks like the type of bag that was there, and it was 
what I saw in the courtroom. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Can I just see that for a second? 
 
MR. KELLY: Dan, could I see that, please? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And that was the bag that you retrieved initially that evening 
from the Bentley trunk? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you have any other bags with you, other than the ones we 
have now described? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You're sure of that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In the back of the limo did you do anything with these two 
bags, the grip and this Exhibit 26 bag? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Nothing at all? 
 
A: No. Oh, I'm sorry. Say that again. 
 
Q: Did you ever fiddle around in the bags at all? 
 
A: Maybe in-- 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what "fiddle around in the bags." Don't 
answer that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you know what that means? 
 
MR. BAKER: It doesn't matter if he knows what it means. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you look into the bags? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: For what purpose? 
 
A: See what airlines I was going on to tell--make sure the driver 
know and just, you know, get my ticket out, tear it out of the thing 
so I can carry it, close up the bag, put my cell phone in its case. 
You know, do the whole thing, that kind of stuff. 
 
Q: And you did all that in your black grip bag. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you look into this other bag at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where was it? 
 
A: Sitting on the floor, sitting on the seat next to me. 
 
Q: What kind of car was it? 
 
A: Stretch limo. 
 
Q: What color? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: What color was the interior? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Was the light on in the back? 
 
A: I don't think so, but it could have come on. I don't think so. 
 
Q: Did you make any phone calls from the limousine? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did the driver take you directly to the airport? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you converse with him7 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you converse about? 
 
A: About rushing to the airport, about him getting a little lost at 
one point, about Kato. 
 
Q: What did you tell the driver about getting lost? What was that 
conversation about? 
 
A: I told him he was going the wrong way. 
 
Q: When did he go the wrong way? 
 
A: At Sunset. 
 
Q: Which way did he go wrong? 
 
A: When we got to the freeway and he was in the left lane instead 
of the right lane. 
 
Q: And did he then get on-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:--the right lane? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So he was in the wrong lane. You moved him over to the right 
lane so he could get on the freeway? 
 
A: Freeway, yes. He was about to stay in the left lane, and the on 
ramp is on the right. 
 
Q: The on ramp is on the right lane on the east side of the freeway. 
Correct? 
 
A: It would be the south side. 
 
Q: Which side of the freeway is the on ramp going south? 
 
A: It's on the west and it goes south. 
 
Q: West and it goes south. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And he was on the left. 
 
A: Yeah, he was on the north lane. 
 
Q: So you moved him over to the right. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But he didn't get lost. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. Okay. 
 
Q: In other words, he didn't go the wrong way. He just was in the 
wrong lane. 
 
A: Well, I know he was going the wrong way until I corrected him. 
 
Q: So it turned out he didn't go the wrong way. 
 
A: Yeah, I corrected him before he went the wrong way. 
 
Q: And then he got on the freeway going south, and you got to the 
airport? 
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: What time did you leave Rockingham? 
 
A: I don't know. I think it was a little after 11:00. 
 
Q: Before 11:15? 
 
A: I would think so. 
 
Q: Sometime between 11:00 and 11:15? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Can you pin it down any closer? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did it have a clock in it, in the limo? 
 
A: I would assume so, but in a stretch limo you can't see over that 
thing to the dashboard. 
 
Q: Were you wearing a watch? 
 
A: I may have been. 
 
Q: What watch were you wearing? 
 
A: If I was wearing a watch it would have been a Swiss Army 
watch, probably this watch (Indicating). 
 
Q: That watch right there (Indicating)? 
 
A: This type of watch, yes. 
 
Q: And when did you put that watch on? 
 
A: Who knows. 
 
Q: When in the evening of June 12 did you put on your watch? 
 
A: I don't know if I did, but if I had on a watch, this would have 
been the watch. 
 
Q: You don't remember if you had a watch when you put it on? 
 
MR. BAKER: Just answer the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Were you looking at the watch while you were in the limousine 
to see if you were going to be late? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were you looking at the watch before the limousine? 
 
MR. BAKER: You have now elevated "I may have had a watch 
and I don't recall if I did" to he had a watch on and was he looking 
at it, and I am going to object and instruct him not to answer the 
question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: By asking him the questions, it may jog his 
memory that he had such a watch, he was wearing it and was 
indeed looking at it. 
 
MR. BAKER: Then frame it correctly. Don't frame it as a fait 
accompli, because it is not. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You don't remember, do you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't remember looking at a watch to see if you were 
running late at all. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Were you looking at clocks in the house to see if you were 
running late? 
 
A: I looked at a clock. 
 
Q: Which clock? 
 
A: In my kitchen. 
 
Q: How many times did you look at that kitchen clock? 
 
A: In what period of time? 
 
Q: The evening of June 12. 
 
A: I have no idea. 
 
Q: When you did look at it, what time did it say? 
 
A: It was after 11:00. 
 
Q: When you went in to get the drink of water? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you look at it any time before that point in time to see if 
you were running late or for any other reason? 
 
A: I'm sure, if I was in the kitchen earlier that day or that 
afternoon, there's a chance I might have looked at the watch--I 
mean the clock. 
 
Q: I mean any time in the evening of the 12th. 
 
A: If I was in the kitchen, I may have looked at the clock. 
 
Q: Did you look at any other, clocks in your house the evening of 
June 12? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where were those clocks? 
 
A: One was by my bed. 
 
Q: And what other clocks did you look at? 
 
A: That I'm conscious of, I can't recall. 
 
Q: And do you remember specifically looking at the bed clock? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What times? 
 
A: It was--it registered about 10:40, 10:35 to 10:40. 
 
Q: What was your purpose in looking at the clock at 10:35? 
 
A: That's when I became aware that the limo driver was, to me, late 
and I had to get moving, 
 
Q: The limo driver had not yet arrived? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And do you recall looking at the clock any other time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you were in the bedroom around 10:35 or so and you 
looked at the clock, what were you doing in the bedroom.? 
 
A: Sitting on my bed, kind of sitting, half laying, sitting on the 
pillows on my bed. 
 
Q: How long had you been doing that? 
 
A: 10, 15 minutes. 
 
Q: So you were lying on the bed for about 15 minutes, sitting or 
lying-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: --on the bed. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you saw the clock at 10:35 or so? 
 
A: 10:35 or 40. It's right in that area. That's what it registered. 
 
Q: And then you--when you saw the time, you got up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you do at that point? 
 
A: Went and took a dump. 
 
Q: How long did that take? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Then what did do you? 
 
A: Jumped in the shower. 
 
Q: How long did that take? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Then what did you do? 
 
A: Got out of the shower. 
 
Q: Then what did you do? 
 
A: Dried off. 
 
Q: Then what? 
 
A: Started to get dressed. 
 
Q: Then what? 
 
A: Started finishing packing my suitcase. 
 
Q: When you got out of the shower and got dressed, what time was 
it when you finished dressing? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Was the limo driver there-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --when you finished dressing? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was he there when you got out of the shower? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How do you know? 
 
A: Because I heard my phone continuing to ring. 
 
Q: And you didn't answer it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When is the first time you heard it ring? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: When is the first time you remember hearing it ring? 
 
A: At some point in time when I was in the shower. 
 
Q: You heard the phone in the shower? 
 
A: Yes. You don't hear it clearly. At some point I thought I heard 
the phone ring, and I opened the door to the shower and I looked at 
it, and the phone was ringing. 
 
Q: When you are talking about the phone ringing, are you talking 
about the telephone ringing? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that what rings when the limo buzzes outside the Ashford 
gate? 
 
A: Right. 
 
Q: Does it ring different than a normal telephone call? 
 
A: You mean the sound? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you tell if it's a person out at the gate versus a phone call? 
 
A: I can, yes. 
 
Q: How? 
 
A: It keeps ringing in the line that lights up when it's ringing. 
 
MR. BREWER: I'm sorry? 
 
THE WITNESS: The line that lights up when it's ringing and it 
keeps ringing. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: But if you're in the shower, you can't see the line. Correct? 
 
A: When I open the door to the shower, I can. 
 
Q: Did you do that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So you heard the phone ringing, you opened the door to the 
shower, then you looked at a phone instrument, you saw a light on, 
and that told you it was the limo driver. 
 
A: No. At first I knew it was the limo driver because once I heard it 
ringing, at one point when I was aware of it ringing, I hit the door 
and it continued to ring, so I knew it had to be the gate; and at 
some point as I'm coming out, I looked and it was the gate, but it 
had stopped ringing, It had stopped ringing at that point. 
 
Q: When you say you "hit the door," what do you mean by that? 
 
A: The shower door. 
 
Q: You hit it for what reason? 
 
A: To open it. 
 
Q: To open it to see the phone? 
 
A: Actually I was getting out, but I tend to open the shower door, 
grab my towel, and because my shower is sort of a steam shower, 
dry off in the shower. 
 
Q: In any event, by looking at the instrument and hearing the 
constant ringing, you knew it wasn't a phone call, but the limo 
driver. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Now, did you hear it while you were in the shower then? 
 
A: At some point, yes. 
 
Q: And when you got out of the shower and were drying off-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --did you still continue to hear it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So when you got out, before you dried off, did you go to the 
phone to call the limo driver? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Can you call from your phone? 
 
A: I think so. I think you can hit the gate and the gate will open. I 
don't know if it will ring out there. The gate will open out there. 
 
Q: When you hear -when you heard-Withdrawn. What do you have 
to do to let the limo driver in from upstairs in your bedroom? 
 
A: Pick up the phone and push a number that's on my phone. 
 
Q: What number is that? 
 
A: I don't recall right now. 
 
Q: Can you talk to the limo driver by picking up the phone and 
dialing some number? 
 
A: No. Just by picking up the phone, if it's on that line, you can 
talk to the limo driver. 
 
Q: And if he is not on the line, you can't talk to him, obviously. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Will his phone ring on the other, line? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: If you wanted to talk to him but he is not on the line, will it ring 
so that he will pick it up and he can talk to you? 
 
MR. BAKER: Do you understand that question? 
 
THE WITNESS: I think I understand what he's saying, yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Okay. But-- 
 
A: I've never done that. 
 
Q: In any event, when you got out of the shower, you dried off 
before pressing that button to open the door. Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: To open the door? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Open the gate. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When you got out of the shower, you dried off before doing 
anything? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did you go and press the button on your phone that would 
activate the gate and let the driver in? 
 
A: I didn't. 
 
Q: You didn't. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And after you--But you knew he was out there. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And after you dried off, you dressed. Right? 
 
A: Yes, started to get dressed and started to pack--finish packing. 
 
Q: While you were dressing--Withdrawn. While you were drying, 
did the phone ring again? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: While you were dressing, did the phone ring again? 
 
A: Yeah, eventually, yes. 
 
Q: And did you then, while you were dressing and heard the phone 
ring, press the button to let the gate open? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And then you finished dressing and then-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --did what? 
 
A: Went outside. 
 
Q: Did you pack first after you finished dressing? 
 
A: I don't understand what you're saying. 
 
Q: When you finished dressing-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --did you resume packing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You were already packed? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Completely packed? 
 
A: Completely packed. 
 
Q: And where was the Louis Vuitton bag? 
 
A: On my bed. 
 
Q: Closed and packed. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that occurred, it was closed and packed, before you went 
into the shower. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When did you close and pack it? 
 
A: As I told you before-- 
 
Q: Pack and close it, I should say. 
 
A: As I told you before, when I came up, I closed it up, I folded it 
up, put on my shirt, put on my jean top and carried it downstairs. 
 
Q: What I am trying to understand, Mr. Simpson, is: Did you 
complete the packing of the Louis Vuitton bag and closing it up-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --after or before you took your shower? 
 
A: After I took my shower. 
 
Q: Right after you took your shower, you dried. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you dressed. Right? 
 
A: Halfway, yeah, and eventually, yes. Yes. 
 
Q: When you were packing your Vuitton bag to finish off the 
packing, were you already fully dressed? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So you were partly dressed. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You had pants on? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Loafers? 
 
A: Yes 
 
Q: No shirt? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you resumed packing. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Finished packing. 
 
A: When I finished packing, yes. 
 
Q: Put your shirt on. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Then put that other shirt over it Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Then went downstairs. 
 
A: For the second time, yes. 
 
Q: Now, from the time you got out of the shower to the moment 
you went downstairs, at any time during that interval did you press 
the button to let the limo driver in? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And how many times did the phone ring from the moment you 
got out of the shower until you went downstairs? 
 
A: Once. 
 
Q: And how many times did it ring that occasion? 
 
A: Once. 
 
Q: When I said--how many rings? 
 
A: Once. 
 
Q: And you could tell from the line that it was the limo driver. 
Right? 
 
A: That and the fact that I picked it up. 
 
Q: You picked it up and you talked to him? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you then say? 
 
A: I said, "I'm coming right down. I'm running late, I know. I'm 
coming right down." 
 
Q: Then you hung up. 
 
A: I believe so. Yeah, I believe so. 
 
Q: Did you press the button at that point to let the gate open? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did he say to you? Anything? 
 
A: I think he dialed me right back to say that he had been there, 
and I'm not sure if it was all a part of the same conversation or the 
phone rung immediately right after I said, "Yeah, I'm running late," 
and then I told him. He said something about he had been waiting. 
I said, "Yeah, I know. I was in the shower." 
 
Q: So you hung up the phone, and then he called right back? 
 
A: Yeah, I believe so. I believe so. 
 
Q: And you picked up again? 
 
A: Yeah. It could have been one conversation. I'm not sure, but I 
seem to recall it, because I know I was irritated when I had to 
continue this conversation with him. 
 
Q: Irritated about what? 
 
A: Well, I was running late, and it was like, you know, this guy's 
telling me he's been here. So terrific. You've been here. And it 
wasn't Dale, so... 
 
Q: Dale? 
 
A: Dale. 
 
Q: St. John? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Your regular driver? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: For many years? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. LEONARD: I don't know about anybody else, but I've got to 
hit the head. I don't know if this is a good time for a break or-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 4:42. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson, when--is it clear in your mind that the first time 
you heard the buzzer from the limo driver was when you were in 
the shower? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, the phone. 
 
THE WITNESS: The phone. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: The phone rings. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were in the shower. 
 
A: That's correct.

A: Correct. 
 
Q: And the second time-- 
 
A: I didn't respond by answering it. 
 
Q: Right. You didn't respond at all. 
 
A: Yes.

Q: When you were dressing and you heard the phone ring-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --did you pick it up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you had a little discussion which you've already testified 
to. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: But you did not let him in then. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And then you finished dressing, packing, going downstairs, and 
you didn't hear the phone ring again during that time. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And then you went downstairs and out the door. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And did you let him in then? 
 
A: He was in then, but--yeah, he was in then. 
 
Q: Did you let him in? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How did he get in? 
 
A: I assume Kato let him in. 
 
Q: You don't know? 
 
A: That's the only assumption I make. 
 
Q: You didn't buzz him in. Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: You never went to your phone instrument, pressed that button 
and let the gate open. Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And you didn't do anything to cause the gate to open. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And when you came downstairs to go out to the Bronco to get 
what you said was the windbreaker and the case for the phone, he 
was already there. Correct? 
 
A: I didn't come downstairs to do that, no. 
 
Q: When you came downstairs, though, you did that.

A Yes 
 
Q: --and then went out to the car

Q: But at that point in time Mr. Park was already in-- 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: --and you don't know how he got there. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Did you ask Kato? 
 
A: No. Q: How would Kato have let him in? 
 
A: Since he was out front, I'm assuming he pushed the button. 
 
Q: To the left of the gate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Would there have been any other way that Kato could have 
opened that gate on Rockford? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
MR. BAKER: On Rockford? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. On Ashford. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: What are the other options that Kato had to do that? 
 
A: He could have picked up the phone and pushed whatever 
number to let him in. 
 
Q: Any telephone in the house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: He had access to the phones in the house? 
 
A: In his room. 
 
Q: Even in his room he could operate the gate? 
 
A: You know, once he got in that room, I never went in that room 
to see what his phone setup was, but before he got in that room I 
know you could have, yes.

A: Yeah, correct. 
 
Q: And--Now, you said when you went upstairs, you closed the 
lights, and what lights-- 
 
A: I turned off the lights at some point downstairs, yes. 
 
Q: You previously testified that you did so when you left the 
Bentley, went into the house and went upstairs. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that question. 
 
You can ask him a question, but you're not going to interrogate 
him on your interpretation of what he previously said. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did you turn the lights off when you went into the house from 
your business at the Bentley on your way upstairs? 
 
A: What lights were still on downstairs, big lights, yes. 
 
Q: What lights did you turn off downstairs that you just referred 
to? 
 
A: If--probably the kitchen lights. because I think I had previously 
turned out all the TV and the lights that were in my den and stuff. 
 
Q: The lights in your TV room, if on, can be seen--first of all, 
they're on the first floor. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And those lights can be seen from Ashford out in front of the 
gate there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: If they're on, nobody can see that? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: But they were off. 
 
A: I believe I turned them off, yes. 
 
Q: Then you turned off the big lights downstairs. Right? 
 
A: The overhead lights in the kitchen I believe so. 
 
Q: And then you turned off the coach lights outside? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: They were not on, though. Correct? 
 
A: I'm not sure. 
 
Q: What's your best recollection? Were they on or not on? 
 
A: I don't have a recollection one way or the other. 
 
Q: Then you turned off the entryway light on the other side of the 
front door. Correct? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Were those lights already off? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: So when you went upstairs around 10:15, 10:20 p.m., there 
were no lights on downstairs to your knowledge. Correct? 
 
A: That's incorrect. 
 
Q: What lights were on? 
 
A: A lamp in my kitchen and my lamp in my entry. 
 
Q: And can--do those lights project light outside of the home onto 
the property? 
 
A: It depends. 
 
Q: It depends on what? 
 
A: If you're sitting in front of the front door or if you're sitting in 
front of the kitchen. 
 
Q: If you're sitting in front of the front door, can you see any lights 
on? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: If you're sitting in front of the kitchen, can you see any lights 
on? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: If you are sitting out at the Ashford gate. can you see any lights 
on? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How do you know that? 
 
A: Because I've done it. 
 
Q: When did you do it? 
 
A: Numerous times. 
 
Q: Did you do it in the last month? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: For what reason? 
 
A: To prove it to some people. 
 
Q: To whom did you prove it? 
 
A: To my lawyers. 
 
Q: Which lawyers? 
 
A: My current lawyers. 
 
Q: The lawyers sitting here to your right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you attempt to prove? 
 
A: Just showing them that you can't tell what lights are on in my 
house from the gates. 
 
Q: Did you do it at night? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: At 10:00--What time was it? 
 
A: Late at night. I don't know exactly what time. 
 
Q: After 10:00 o'clock p.m.? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: And what lights did you turn on downstairs? 
 
A: Virtually all of them. 
 
Q: Every single light downstairs? 
 
A: I said "virtually," not all. I would say 90 percent of the lights.

A: Yes. 
 
Q: The lamp in the entryway? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The big light in the kitchen? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you turn on the coach lights outside? 
 
A: I think at one point they were, yes. 
 
Q: But at one point they were not turned on. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you turn on the lights in the TV room? 
 
A: All of them. 
 
Q: All of them. 
 
A: Yes.

A: Yes. 
 
Q: Which ones? 
 
A: All the lights in my dining room, all the lights in my living 
room, all the lights in my tennis room, all the lights in my 
bedroom, all the lights in my bathroom, yes. 
 
Q: What lights downstairs did you leave off? 
 
A: Downstairs? The overhead lights in my kitchen and my office. 
 
Q: Why did you leave those lights off? 
 
A: Because those are lights I don't believe was on the night of the 
12th. 
 
Q: And then you went and positioned yourself on the other side of 
the gate at Ashford? 
 
A: Inside and outside of the gate, on both gates. 
 
Q: And what did you see? 
 
A: A house that looked like no lights were on. 
 
Q: Why did it look like no lights were on? 
 
A: You'd have to ask God that. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Because he's a physicist. 
 
THE WITNESS: He's a physicist and I'm not. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You could not see any lights? 
 
A: Nobody with me could see any lights. 
 
Q: How do you know that? 
 
A: Because they said it. 
 
Q: Who said it? 
 
A: Whoever I was with. 
 
Q: And who were you with? 
 
A: I've done this--I can't recall who -- 
 
I've done this with virtually everyone who's come into my house. 
 
Q: You've done it with Bob Baker, Dan Leonard and Bob Blasier. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who else have you done it with? 
 
A: A film crew. 
 
Q: That made your video? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: Just about everybody who's come to my house who--I can't 
recall who. 
 
Q: You make a point of doing it when they come to your house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What else do you make a point of doing? 
 
MR. BAKER: If anything. 
 
THE WITNESS: Treating them very nice. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you make a point of proving anything else to these people? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What else? 
 
A: That my housekeeper can cook and that my mom's a great cook 
and that I'm a good host. 
 
Q: Did you make a point of proving anything else that you were 
innocent of these charges? 
 
MR. BAKER: That's argumentative. 
 
Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: You said you were trying to prove to these people that nobody 
could see the lights, and that's for the purpose of proving some fact 
that you think is important to your case. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: He didn't say that. 
 
THE WITNESS: I didn't say that. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't. Don't. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Why do you prove this fact to so many people who come to 
your house? What's your purpose in doing it? 
 
A: That's a question that's asked. 
 
Q: It's always volunteered by the other person? 
 
A: Except with the film company, yes. 
 
Q: What do they ask you, these people? 
 
A: Why no lights were on in my house that night. 
 
Q: And what you do you say? 
 
A: I say that was incorrect. 
 
Q: What was incorrect? 
 
A: That assumption that there were no lights on in my house. 
 
Q: You know for a fact that all these lights that you just described 
were on? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q: You've already-I want to be clear about this. When you went 
upstairs at 10:15, 10:20, the only lights that you said were on--or 
that were on, I should say, were the lamp in the kitchen and the 
lamp in an entryway. Correct? 
 
A: No, that's not correct. 
 
Q: What else was on? 
 
A: My bedroom lights. 
 
Q: The only lights downstairs were the lamp in the kitchen and the 
lamp in the entry. Correct? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: When you came downstairs the first time after showering and 
going to the bathroom and all that, you came downstairs with the 
Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
Did you turn on any lights? 
 
A: I don't think that's correct. 
 
Q: What's not correct? 
 
A: That I came down the first time with the Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
Q: After you were dressed. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Came down with what bag? 
 
A: Louis Vuitton, after I was dressed, completely dressed. 
 
Q: Had you turned on any lights by then? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't really know. 
 
Q: What's your best-- 
 
A: I may have turned on--then I may have turned on the coach 
lights. 
 
Q: When you came down with the Louis Vuitton bag? 
 
A: No. I may have turned them on earlier. 
 
Q: What time? 
 
A: When I came down with my suit bag to look for my shoes and 
my golf bag. 
 
Q: Before or after you dressed? 
 
A: Before I got completely dressed. 
 
Q: Half dressed? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: No shirt on? 
 
A: No shirt on. 
 
Q: You walked downstairs with the suit bag and laid it outside 
where the golf bag is. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And at that time you turned on a light? 
 
A: I may have, when I went back in, turned on the coach lights. 
 
Q: And the coach lights but not the entryway light. Correct? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: And Park was already there at that time. Right? 
 
A: He was at the gate. 
 
Q: Not in. 
 
A: Not in. 
 
Q: Kato hadn't let him in yet. 
 
A: As far as I know, no. 
 
Q: And you went upstairs, finished dressing, came back down with 
the Louis Vuitton bag. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you turn any lights on at that point? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: And by this point Park was there, Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when you were half dressed and the phone rang and it was 
Park, why didn't you let him in then? 
 
A: Because I didn't want to open my gate. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: I didn't want my dog to go out. 
 
Q: Where was your dog? 
 
A: In the front yard. 
 
Q: As it turned out, your gate was opened without your knowledge, 
anyway. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did your dog run out? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How do you know? 
 
A: Well, I really don't know. Maybe he did. But Kato was there at 
that point in time, so I may have mentioned to Kato--I may have; I 
may not have, but I normally do. I wouldn't have worried about it 
because somebody would have been there to get her back in. 
 
Q: Chachi? 
 
A: Chachi. 
 
Q: And when you--Was Chachi outside? 
 
A: Chachi lives outside, yes. 
 
Q: She never goes into your house? 
 
A: She's been in my house once or twice, but... 
 
Q: Was she outside on the evening of June 12 when you were 
doing the golf balls? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you went back down to go to the Bronco to get the 
cell phone and/or the cell phone case, was she outside? 
 
A: Outside of the house, yes. 
 
Q: When you opened that gate to go out to the Bronco, did she go 
out the gate? 
 
A: At that time, no. 
 
Q: Did you look for her to restrain her before you went out? 
 
A: I always do, yeah. I have look to see where she is. 
 
Q: Did you see her? 
 
A: I didn't see her, so I knew she wasn't where she can go out. 
 
Q: But when you were at the Bronco, she could have gotten out. 
Correct? 
 
A: Which time at the Bronco? 
 
Q: When you went out that time to get the phone. 
 
A: The last time. 
 
Q: The last time that you've mentioned to us. 
 
A: Yes, but I wasn't concerned because Kato was there then. 
 
Q: When you went to get the phone or the phone case and the 
windbreaker. Kato was-- 
 
A: Was there, so he could have gotten her in while I was gone. 
 
Q: Did you tell Kato, "Hold on to the dog" or "Watch the dog"? 
 
A: No. I didn't need to do that, no. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because I didn't see the dog go out. Because it's understood at 
my house, as a rule at my house, because the SPCA has given us 
numerous warnings, as a rule at my house with housekeepers and 
Kato and everyone there: Don't let the dog out. So everybody is 
sort of aware that you don't let the dog out. 
 
Q: And you were aware of that when you went to the Bronco? 
 
A: I'm aware of that even every morning when I leave to go play 
golf. 
 
Q: So you didn't want to let the limo driver in because the dog 
might get out. Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: Yeah, and I didn't know if Kato was around or not, so I wouldn't 
have time to look for her. 
 
Q: When you came downstairs the last time and saw the limo 
driver there, were you concerned that your dog might have gotten 
out inadvertently? 
 
A: Not so much, no. 
 
Q: Did you ask Kato, "Did the dog get out?" 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask the driver? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask Kato or the driver anything about the dog? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: You just said that you--I asked you a question about going to 
the Bronco. You said "the second time." Did you go to the Bronco 
another time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: An earlier time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When did you go to the Bronco on the evening of June 12 an 
earlier time? 
 
A: When I was chipping balls and looking for my sand wedge. 
 
Q: You described what you did at the Bentley truck already. 
 
A: At the Bentley car, yes. 
 
Q: The Bentley car. Excuse me. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when did you go to the Bronco in reference to what you 
did at the Bentley? 
 
A: After I put my pitching wedge back in the trunk of the Bentley, 
I walked and looked into the back window of the Bronco to see if 
there were any clubs back there. 
 
Q: After you got the pitching wedge out of the Bentley, hit those 
golf balls wherever you hit them-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --you put the pitching wedge back-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --took out the bag? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: You took out the bag with the balls and the windbreaker, you 
put it on the ground and then you went to the Bronco? 
 
A: No, not correct. 
 
MR. BAKER: Compound question and the sequence is wrong. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, the sequence is wrong. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let's get it right then. Okay? 
 
MR. LEONARD: He did get it right. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I'm kinda slow. Let me see if I can sort 
it out. 
 
Q: You got the-- 
 
MR. BAKER: This is the third time we are going over this, and I 
am not going to let him go over it again. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He has not discussed going to the Bronco 
before at all. 
 
MR. BAKER: Discuss going to the Bronco then, but you keep 
going back, and I think it's untoward to have him go over and over 
and over the same thing, and you've done it 15 times today; and 
you can talk all you want about him going to the Bronco the first 
time, but we are not going to sequence--we are not going to 
resequence the events that we've already sequenced. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let's try to move on. It's getting late. Okay? 
 
Q: Did you go to the Bronco after you completed all of the 
activities that you previously described at the Bentley? 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: You had finished hitting all your golf balls. Right? 
 
A: Yes, sir. 
 
Q: And you had closed the trunk of the Bentley. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So on the ground was the bag with the windbreaker. 
 
A: Yes, I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Before you went inside, you then went to the Bronco? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. You pressed the button? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Rockingham gate opened up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You went out and you went to the Bronco. What did you then 
do at the Bronco? 
 
A: I looked into the back of the Bronco. 
 
Q: For what reason? 
 
A: To see if I had any clubs there. 
 
Q: Did you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You could see? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Then what did you do? 
 
A: I waited for my dog, and we walked around and came in the 
Ashford gate. 
 
Q: You waited for your dog to do what? 
 
A: I guess she took a dump. 
 
Q: Oh, the dog had come out the property? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On the Rockingham side? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you waited until the dog finished its business? 
 
A: Yeah. It went over across the street and up a little bit into ivy 
and various things and took a dump. 
 
Q: The dog did. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: While you were standing at the Bronco? 
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: Doing what? Just watching? 
 
A: Yeah, just--you know, I had what they call a 3 wood in my 
hand, and I was swinging a 3 wood. 
 
Q: Where did you get the 3 wood? 
 
A: Out of my garage. 
 
Q: And then that was after you did the chipping of the golf balls-- 
 
A: That was before. 
 
Q: --with the pitching wedge? 
 
A: That was before. 
 
Q: You had gotten the 3 wood out. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you had laid it next to you when you were hitting the other 
club? 
 
A: I don't think next to me. I may have laid it against the trunk, you 
know, the open trunk, possibly laid it there. I guess. 
 
Q: Of the Bentley? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: After you closed the Bentley, you then took the 3 wood? 
 
A: Yeah, the 3 wood I had, and I was just swinging it. 
 
Q: When you went to the Bronco, you took it with you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you take anything else with you? 
 
A: Other than what I had on me? 
 
Q: Yeah. Carrying anything else? 
 
A: In my pocket, yes. 
 
Q: What? 
 
A: I had a cell phone. 
 
Q: In your pocket? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How long had the cell phone been in your pocket? 
 
A: Since I had gone into the garage. Actually, maybe not. Maybe I 
went and grabbed it after I was in the garage. 
 
Q: Grabbed it from where? 
 
A: The kitchen. 
 
Q: When you went outside to go hit golf balls? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You went into the kitchen, grabbed your cell phone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And put it in your pocket? 
 
A: No. I made a phone call. 
 
Q: On the cell phone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who did you call? 
 
A: Paula Barbieri. 
 
Q: What time was that? 
 
A: I don't know. I didn't know at the time. I know now. 
 
Q: Now, when you called Paula Barbieri from your cell phone, 
where were you literally standing? 
 
A: In front of my house right behind my Bronco. By the time it 
was ringing, I was standing behind my Bronco. Q: Had you already 
hit the golf balls? 
 
A: No. I hadn't even gotten them yet. 
 
Q: You hadn't swung the wood either? 
 
A: No. I was swinging the wood. 
 
Q: So let me get this straight. You got the phone from the kitchen-- 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: --and you went outside the front door? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where did you go? 
 
A: Outside the garage door. 
 
Q: You went into your garage from the inside of your house? 
 
A: Yeah. It's right at my kitchen, yes. 
 
Q: Opened up the light? 
 
A: The light was already on. 
 
Q: The back light? Was the door open already? 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what the "back light" -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He said there were two lights in the garage. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah, it was already on. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Was the door already opened? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The garage door? 
 
A: I believe so. Yes. I'm not sure of that, but I think so. I'm not a 
hundred percent sure of that. 
 
Q: When had you opened the garage door? 
 
A: When I came out to look in my Bentley. 
 
Q: So when you went to get the cell phone in the kitchen, this was 
before you had gone to the Bentley to open up the trunk and look 
for the clubs. Correct? 
 
A: As I said a few minutes ago, that's correct. 
 
Q: So you went into the garage from the kitchen, and you went--
opened the light into the garage. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Went out the front--went out the garage door. Right? 
 
A: No. I looked for my sand wedge, and I grabbed -and I was also 
looking for a 3 wood. 
 
Q: Did you find a sand wedge? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Found a 3 wood? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you do with the 3 wood when you came out of the 
garage? 
 
A: I walked back to the door to the kitchen to push the button to 
open the garage door, and opened the door to the kitchen, walked 
in, grabbed my cell phone and walked back out to the garage. 
 
Q: So now you come back out the garage with the 3 wood and the 
cell phone. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Then what do you do? 
 
A: I put a call in to Paula and opened the trunk of my Bentley. 
 
Q: So you were standing near the Bentley when you called Paula. 
Is that right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And the clothing you were wearing? 
 
A: Was whatever I had on from-- 
 
Q: Dark blue pants and a shirt, the color of which you can't 
remember? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you talk to Paula? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you reach an answering machine? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you leave a message? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was your message? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Do you recall anything that you said? 
 
A: Well, yeah. I said I was wondering what was happening, 
because she hadn't called me, said what was going on. 
 
Q: And-- 
 
A: And I thought it was her last chance of taking me to the airport. 
If I had of got her, we had enough time for her to take me to the 
airport, if she was in town. 
 
Q: Okay. If she was in town, you were figuring that she would 
come over and pick you up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You had already ordered the limo. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So then you went--After you made your phone call, what did 
you do with the cell phone? 
 
A: Put it in my pocket. I may have just sat it there because I hit a 
few balls, and then grabbed it and put it in my pocket then swung 
the 3 wood. 
 
Q: After you made the phone call, you either put the phone down 
or in your pocket. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: If you put it down, where did you put it? 
 
A: Right there at the trunk of the Bentley. 
 
Q: And you opened up the trunk, and you described what you did 
at that point. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Closed the trunk. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Took your 3 wood, went out to the Bronco . 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Dog went out. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you looked into the Bronco. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were looking for your sand wedge. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You didn't find it. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: You waited for the dog to finish and then-- 
 
A: We walked up the street. She went across and up a way. First 
she went to Stanley Sheinbaum's stuff. and she walked up, started 
going up the grass to the other, and I was just on the grass walking, 
swinging, and then finally, "Come on, Chachi," and we went into 
the Ashford gate. 
 
Q: The Rockingham gate closed behind you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you entered in the Ashford gate? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How did you get into the Ashford gate? 
 
A: Pushed it. 
 
Q: From the outside of the gate? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You need a key? 
 
A: No. I keep one gate on the hinge, and only we know this, but 
normally I would keep one gate off hinge. So it works if you push 
the button, or if you're walking the dog and you come home and 
you want to get on the property and you don't have a key, you just 
push the gate. 
 
Q: You just push the gate manually. 
 
A: You have to kind of know how to do it. You can't just walk and 
push it. There is a little trick to it that I'm not going to tell America. 
 
Q: Okay. So does the trick still work? 
 
A: Well, now I got security and we keep everything locked all the 
time. 
 
Q: You pushed the gate; you went in with the dog? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On Rockford and closed the gate behind you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you went inside? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Closed the lights and went upstairs. 
 
A: I went-- 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what "Rockford" is. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'm sorry. Ashford. 
 
THE WITNESS: I went in, closed the garage door, turned off the 
lights, yeah. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And that's about 10:15 or 10:20. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you do with the 3 wood? 
 
A: Laid it back--when I went in the garage, just put it back in the 
garage. 
 
Q: Through the inside of the house? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
Q: You went in through the front door. 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: You went into the garage. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You laid the 3 wood down? 
 
A: Yeah, put it where it belongs. 
 
Q: Then came out of the garage? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And what did do you? 
 
A: Walked back into the house. 
 
Q: And closed the garage door? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And entered in the house that way? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And went through the kitchen, then upstairs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Does your garage door make sound-does it make a sound when 
it goes up and down? 
 
A: If you're standing there, I guess you can hear it, yes. 
 
Q: And the dog stayed outside on the property? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when you--when was the first time that you encountered 
Kato Kaelin when you were getting ready to leave for the airport? 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what you mean by "getting ready to 
leave for the airport." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Do you know what I mean? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He said that he ran into Kato sometime when 
he came back--when he came downstairs to go to the airport. 
 
MR. BAKER: Okay. You mean when the limo--that's not getting 
ready to go, in my view, but that's okay. As long as we are on the 
same wavelength, that's fine. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, we're on the same wavelength. 
 
Q: Do you understand what I'm saying? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: This is to the best of my recollection. This is--you know, I came 
out, dropped the two bags. I didn't see Kato. The limo driver was 
standing there. I think I heard Kato, because he wasn't standing in 
front of the house. I looked in my bag, and I went back into the 
house and into the kitchen, came back out, and then I saw Kato 
over by the garage and he was talking to me from over there. 
 
Q The garage door was closed Right? 
 
A: Yeah 
 
Q: He was in front of the garage. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, he was in that area between the house, the garage. He was 
talking to me in front of the limo, just in that area. 
 
Q: Now, what was he saying to you? 
 
A: He was talking about--something about earthquakes 
 
Q: He said he heard--felt an earthquake? 
 
A: I wasn't really paying much attention to him. I was trying to get 
myself together and he was talking, and I don't think I really 
focused on what he was talking about until I came back from the 
Bronco, and then I for the first time really focused on what he was 
talking about. 
 
Q: The first time, before you went to the Bronco, he--what is your 
best recollection of what he said to you across from this garage 
area where he was standing? 
 
A: He was moving, and he was just talking about an earthquake. 
 
Q: He used the word "earthquake"? 
 
A: Yeah. He did ask me if I overslept. That was one of the first 
things he said to me, "Did you oversleep?" And then he was 
talking about noise and earthquake. 
 
Q: When he asked you, "Did you oversleep," what did you say? 
 
A: I don't even think I responded to it. I don't recall really 
responding. I said, "I'm just running late," or something, but I 
didn't have any really specific response to it, I don't think. 
 
Q: What was he wearing? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did he have shoes on? 
 
A: I would assume so. 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: It isn't I remember. I didn't pay any-I don't know if you got on 
shoes. I haven't paid any attention. 
 
Q: Did you see that he had shoes on? 
 
A: No, I didn't see one way or the other. 
 
Q: Can you identify what he was wearing? 
 
A: Not at all. Or Alan Park, for that matter. 
 
Q: Was he holding anything? 
 
A: Not that I recall. 
 
Q: He said something to you about noises? 
 
A: He was talking about an earthquake, is what he was talking 
about. 
 
Q: You mentioned before that he said something about noises. 
What did he say about noises? 
 
A: He heard something. "Did you feel an earthquake"-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Are we talking about a different time now? We are 
not talking -- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We are talking about the same time. 
 
MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. We are talking about him moving 
out by the garage area and the earthquake, and then you said--your 
question goes to the noises, and I just want to make sure we are at 
the same time frame. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. He -in one of his prior answers about 
this exact event, he said Kato was talking about earthquake noises, 
noises, earthquake. 
 
MR. BAKER: That's not the exact event. I want the question read 
back, please. 
 
MR. LEONARD: And the answer. 
 
(Record read as follows: 
 
"Q. You mentioned before that he said something about noises. 
What did he say about noises? 
 
"A. He heard something. 'Did you feel an earthquake'--") 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: When he said something to you about noises, you are saying he 
said, "Did you hear something." 
 
A: I don't think so. I think he asked me, did I feel an earthquake. 
 
Q: Did he-- 
 
A: And then as--as I said, I was going in and out, to my Bronco 
and back, and he was talking about noises and -and hearing 
something, earthquakes. I mean, I really didn't pay any much 
attention to what he was talking about. 
 
MR. BAKER: Most people don't. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Well, off of your lawyer's comment, was Mr. Kaelin to your 
knowledge typically incoherent in your dealings with him? 
 
A: I mean, you guys seen Kato. Kato's Kato. 
 
Q: Did you find him to be incoherent, by and large, in your 
dealings with him? 
 
A: I found him to be Kato. Kato's very unique. I found him to be a 
very nice guy who is a little goofy, but I like him. 
 
Q: You didn't believe at that time, June 12, 1994, that he was 
incoherent? A: I wasn't paying--Kato. for what I was doing at the 
time, he was totally --it was totally insignificant, whatever he was 
talking about to me at that moment. 
 
Q: But prior to that moment, though, my question to you is: In 
your relationship with him, you didn't find him to be someone 
incoherent. 
 
A: I found him to be Kato, and he's just not your everyday guy. 
He's Kato. He's Kato. I mean, you've seen him. 
 
Q: In your conversations with Kato before that moment, were you 
able to communicate with him? 
 
A: I've always been able to communicate with him. 
 
Q: Now, when he mentioned this thing about noises and/or 
earthquake, had you felt an earthquake? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Had you heard any noises? 
 
A: I don't believe so, no. 
 
Q: At that point then, you went out to the Bronco, as you testified. 
Right? 
 
A: I don't think--that's not necessarily what I testified. I said as I 
was doing all of this stuff, Kato was talking, and I can't say 
exactly--I know when he first saw me, almost the first thing he 
asked me was, "Did you oversleep and did you hear"-- 
 
"did you feel an earthquake?" 
 
Then I was busy doing what I was doing; he and Park was talking, 
he was saying things, and I can't tell you exactly what he said. 
Between then and when I went out and when I came in, it was just 
about noises or hearing -- 
 
I wasn't paying attention to him. I just was not paying attention to 
him or Park when I came--I do recall asking him, "Well, doesn't he 
have a flashlight," and saying that there should be one in the 
kitchen in the cupboard. 
 
Other than that, I--whatever he was talking about at the time 
meant-was insignificant to me. It really--I wasn't really--I was 
trying to get a flight to Chicago, a flight I didn't want to take. 
 
Q: Did Mr.--Withdrawn. Did Mr. Kaelin tell you why he wanted a 
flashlight? 
 
A: To look--I guess to look around the side of the house. I may 
have said to him, "Get a flashlight and look back there." I may 
have said that to him. 
 
Q: What did Mr. Kato Kaelin tell you about wanting to go and look 
back with a flashlight? 
 
A: I don't know if he said anything about. I may have suggested it. 
 
Q: Did he tell you that he thought there were prowlers back there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he say anything about that? 
 
A: No. He just said he heard a noise. 
 
Q: And he wanted to investigate the noise? 
 
A: Pardon me? 
 
Q: He said he wanted to investigate the noise? 
 
A: No. He said he heard a noise, and I said, "Well, why don't you 
get a flashlight and look," and I made a suggestion, "Let's grab a 
flashlight. I'll go one way, you go the other way, and we'll see." 
 
Q: Did he-- 
 
MR. LEONARD: Excuse me. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Did he tell you what the noise was that he heard? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he describe the noise to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you in fact go one way and he went the other way? 
 
A: I think we were about to, and it was very dark, and that's when I 
may have said, "Well, we better get a flashlight," and he went into 
the kitchen. 
 
Q: Did he describe generally where the noise came from7 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did he say if the noise--he heard the noise in his room? 
 
A: Yes. I assume that's where he heard it, yes. 
 
Q: Did he say he wanted to go look in the alleyway behind his 
room?  
 
MR. BAKER: Well, I don't know what you're referring to as an 
"alleyway," but if you're talking about the space behind his room, 
I'll certainly allow him to answer that question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's what I'm talking-- 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, I obviously got that impression, yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And did you give him a flashlight? 
 
A: We went and looked for a flashlight, told him where I thought a 
flashlight was. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: In the cupboard of my kitchen. 
 
Q: Did you find one? 
 
A: He looked and--I never looked. He looked and said it was. I 
noticed the time about that time and realized I needed to get 
moving, so I said, "Why don't you keep looking" as I was leaving. 
 
Q: And then you left? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: And then we should leave, He's got very few 
minutes left on the tape. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, we'll stop now because he's out of tape, 
as you suggest, and we will resume tomorrow at 9:30. 
 
MR. BAKER: That's a great segue: "Did you leave," and we're all 
leaving. Wonderful.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, having been previously duly sworn, was 
examined and testified further as follows:

MR.BAKER: You know, I want him to correct something that I think he 
misused Bronco and Bentley yesterday.

So OJ., you want to--
THE WITNESS: I may have inadvertently, as we were going through the 
B's and B's, Bronco and Bentley, once or twice possibly -- I don't recall, 
but my lawyers tell me that maybe once or twice I might have said "Bronco" 
when I meant Bentley and "Bentley" when I meant Bronco.

EXAMINATION (Resumed)

BY MR.PETROCELLI:

Q: Can you remember when that occurred?
A: No,I can't.

Q: What did your lawyers tell you about when you may have misused 
Bronco and Bentley?
MR.BAKER: He is not going to tell you what we told him, Mr. Petrocelli.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Well, based on what they said to you, can you tell us where you think 
you may have misused Bronco and Bentley, without going into your 
conversation with them?
MR. BAKER: That's the same thing. That's by another means trying to 
break into the attorney-client privilege, and I am not going to allow him to do 
that. But you can ask him --

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Since you've opened it up, I need to follow up on this to make sure we 
have a complete understanding of your testimony, and I don't want to have 
to go through --
MR. BAKER: I will tell you where I thought he misspoke, and that was 
where he was talking about the cell phone conversation with Barbieri, and he 
said     "Bentley" once and "Bronco" once and "Bentley" another time.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: As I understood your testimony yesterday, you made a cell phone call
to Paula Barbieri when you got out of the garage at or near the location of the   
Bentley, and when you completed that call, you either put the cell phone in 
your pocket or near the trunk of the Bentley. Is that correct?

A: That is correct.

Q:: Do you have a clearer understanding as to what you did with that cell 
phone when you completed the call?
A: Obviously I took it with me, so since I was swinging the club, I assume it 
was in my pocket.

Q: Did you do any preparation for today's session, Mr. Simpson?
A: Absolutely none.

Q: Read anything?
A: Absolutely nothing.

Q: Did you watch television and pick up any pointers?
MR. BAKER: You don't have to answer that. It's a good question, but he is 
not going to answer it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.
Q: I would like to ask you a few questions about the alarm system at your 
house in June of 1994.
A: Uh-huh.

Q: Could you tell us whether you had an alarm system.?
A: Yes.

Q: And did the alarm system work with respect to the Ashford and 
Rockingham gates?
A: No.

Q: It worked with respect to the exterior doors of the residence. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: It was a Westec system.
A: Yes.

Q: Is this a system where you could activate or deactivate the alarm through a 
remote location or device, such as a telephone?

A: No.

Q: The only -- What were the ways in which you could activate the alarm at 
the house in June of 1994?

A: There's a pad in my bedroom. There's a pad in my upstairs hall. There's 
a pad inside and outside the front door. There's a pad inside and outside the 
laundry door.

Q: Inside and outside the laundry door?
A: Yeah.

Q: Is the outside of the laundry door the exterior of the property?
A: No. It's in the garage.

Q: So when you go into the garage from the driveway, if you were to enter 
the garage and go out the door that leads into the residence, you go right into 
the laundry room.
A: Yes.

Q: And in the garage on the outside of that laundry room door is a pad?
A: That's correct.

Q: And on the inside is a pad?
A: That's correct.

Q: Now, when you enter the residence, and let's assume the alarm is on, are 
you required to deactivate the alarm from the outside pad?
A: Yes.

Q: And if you deactivate the alarm from the outside pad and then you open 
the door and enter, is the alarm off now?
A: Yes.

Q: If you were not to deactivate the alarm from the outside pad but enter the 
residence anyway, could you then deactivate it from an inside pad?
A: Yes.

Q: And is there a delay of a certain interval of time before the alarm will start 
ringing?
A: I don't believe so.

Q: So if you fail to punch in the code on the pad and you open the door, 
what happens?
A: The alarm goes off.

Q: And what does that mean? Bells ring? Whistles sound?
A: An alarm goes off.

Q: Does it ring over to the Westec Security place as well?
A: Yes.

Q: And the police department?
A: I don't think so.

Q: Okay. Who -- By the way, the way you just described the system, that's 
how it functioned in June of 1994. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: It hasn't changed, has it?
A: That's--yeah. Yes.

Q: Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: Did you have the code in June of 1994?
A: Yes.

Q: What was it, like a four-digit code?
A: Yes.

Q: And who else had that code to your knowledge?
A: My family, my immediate family, Arnelle and Jason; my house keeper--

Q: Names.
A: Well, Gigi. Michelle possibly. Nicole. A.C. And I don't know after that.

Q: Were there doors that one could -- Let's assume the alarm was on. Were 
there doors that people could go in and out of the house through that would 
not activate the alarm?
A: Yes.

Q: Which doors were those?
A: The ones that came from the guest house into the house, and -- I don't 
know -- I have some window doors. I don't know if they're -- if they were 
on the alarm at the time, and I don't think any of the windows were on the 
alarm at that time.

Q: How many guest houses were on the property? One?
A: Three.

Q: Now, do each of those guest houses have a door that goes into the
main residence?
A: No.Just one.

Q: Just one. And who was in that guest house at the time?
A: Kato.

Q: Did Kato also have a door that went out to the exterior of the property?
A: Yes.

Q: And was that door on the alarm?
A: To the exterior of the property, no.

Q: So Kato could come into his guest house by getting into this exterior door 
that went directly into his guest house; even if the alarm was on, it would not 
go off. Correct?
A: It depends. If-- there was an alarm there, too. I missed that one. It 
depends if it was engaged or not.

Q: Kato's exterior door had an alarm on it?
A: Yeah.

Q: Was there a keypad in - and outside of his door?
A: Yeah. No. Just outside of his door.

Q: So when Kato - if the alarm were on and Kato were coming home -- let's 
say you were out of town -- he would have to punch the code in order to get 
in. Right?
A: Well, he didn't know the code, but if he had known the code, he would 
have had to do that.

Q: Is this the same--is it on the same code as the rest of the house?
A: Yes.

Q: So when you were out of town and Kaelin was staying there, the alarm 
was never on?
A: He didn't have access to my house. I don't know if the alarm was on, 
because the housekeeper was there, but he didn't have unlimited access into 
my home.

Q: So he would go into the guest house. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: And his normal routine was to enter through this exterior door?
A: Yes.

Q: And based on your ground rules with him, was he permitted to go into the 
interior of the house from his guest house?
A: Unless somebody invited him in.

Q: What if no one invited him?
A: He wasn't supposed to go in. And the door was always locked. There's 
two doors, actually, and both of them were always locked.

Q: Did he have the key to unlock those doors?
A: No.

Q: You said yesterday there was a single key that keyed all the doors on the 
property.
A: No. I had a single key to all the doors on the property.

Q:: But that key also worked on Kaelin's lock, too?
A: Yes.

Q: And he had a key. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: So he could have used that key to access any lock on the property. Right?
A: That's incorrect.

Q: Why is that incorrect?
A: Because he couldn't.

Q; Is it because he didn't have permission?
A: No.

Q: I'm confused. I'm not understanding your testimony. If his lock was 
keyed the same as all the other locks and he had a key --
A: I didn't say that. You said that.

Q: Okay. So his lock was keyed differently. Is that what you're saying?
A: Yes.

Q: The exterior door.
A: Yes.

Q: And the interior doors he did not have the key to. Right?
A: Correct.

Q: And he couldn't open those doors from the inside of his room to get into 
the residence. Is that right?
A: Correct.

Q: They could be locked on the other side of the door. Right?
A: Correct.

Q: Okay. So is his exterior door the only door that was keyed differently 
from the rest of the property?
A: No.

Q: What other doors?
A: Most of them.

Q: Most of the other doors?
A: Yeah, in my house.

Q: Were keyed differently?
A: Yeah, different keys for different things.

Q: Okay.Then I must have misunderstood your testimony yesterday because 
I thought you told me that there was a single --
MR. BAKER: God, he's got a master key. Come on. Let's get it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Is that what it is, a master key?
A: That's correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: See, I don't have a master key, but that's a good idea, 
Mr. Baker. I have like seven keys for my house.

Q: So you have a master key, and everyone --there are a bunch of different 
keys.
A: Yes.

Q: Who has the master key?
A: Me and the housekeeper.

Q: And Arnelle?
A: No.

Q: Did Nicole have one?
A: She wasn't supposed to have one.

Q: Okay. So bottom line here is Kaelin could only get into his room and no 
other room.
A: Correct.

Q: Now, let me go back again. If the alarm was on in the rest of the house 
unbeknownst to Kaelin and Kaelin entered his room through the key -- 
through the exterior door, would the alarm go off?
A: If the alarm was on, yes.

Q: Was it your practice when you were out of town to have the alarm set?
A: It was my practice when I was out of town to have someone at my house.

Q: If you were to -- Your housekeeper, did she work weekends?
A: No, not generally.

Q: So if you were going to be out of town on weekends, would the alarm be 
set?
A: Should be, yes.

Q: And how would Kaelin deal with the setting of the alarm if he's going in 
and out of the house on weekends?

A: As I told you before, he wasnt supposed to be going in and out of
the house on weekends.

Q: What if he went in and out of his guest room, and the alarm were 
activated on the property, and nobody else was home, like your 
housekeeper, would the alarm be going on and off when Kaelin's entering 
his guest room?
A: No.

Q: Why is that?
A: Because, as I told you, his exterior door to his guest room is not on the 
alarm.

Q: Just the interior door?
A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Now, you didn't have anybody at home -- excuse me. There were 
no housekeepers on duty on Saturday and Sunday, June 11 and June 12. 
Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: And the housekeeper was coming the next morning, on Monday?
A: I would assume so, yes.

Q: And she had the code. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: Whenever you leave town and the housekeeper isn't home, do you -- and 
no one else is home, do you always set the alarm?
A: I try to. If I'm thinking about it, I definitely do, yes.

Q: And you set the alarm after you close the front door --
A: Not always.

Q: from the outdoor keypad?
A: Not always. Sometimes as I'm going out the front door.

Q: Can you set the alarm from the inside of the house and then go to the front 
door, open it and leave without the alarm going off?
A: Correct.

Q: Is there a delay from the moment you set it until it becomes activated?
A: Yes, there is.

Q: How long is that delay?
A: I don't know.

Q: Did you set the alarm on the evening of June 12th before you went into 
the limousine?
A: No.

Q: Why not?
A: Because Kato was looking for a flashlight, or I thought he would 
continue to look for a flashlight.

Q: And you left him in the residence, in other words.
A: He was at the front door. When I walked out he was behind me, and I got 
in the limo and I said, "Well, look and see if you can find a flashlight."

Q: Now, your understanding was that Kaelin when he was finished would 
close the front door and go back to his room. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: Through the outside of the property. Right?
A: Well, yes. Or through the inside -- well, yes, through the outside, 
because he couldn't lock the back door, yes.

Q: Did you ask Kaelin to set the alarm for you?
A: No. I think I told him I would call and give him the code. At one point we 
were talking about the code, but I had to leave, and I called him and gave 
him the code.

Q: From where did you call him?
A: I think the airport.

Q: From a pay phone?
A: Yes.

Q: At the gate?
A: Yes.

Q: At American Airlines?
A: Yes.

Q: What gate number? Do you remember?
A: No.

Q: Is that the first time you had ever given Kato Kaelin the code to your
alarm?
A: I believe so, yes.

Q: Is that the first time you had asked Kato Kaelin to set the alarm for you?
A: Yes.

Q: Did Kato say to you that he would do as you requested?
A: Yes.

Q: And do you know whether he did?
A: No.

Q: Did he tell you that he wasn't comfortable receiving the code or doing
the alarm?
A: No.

Q: Did he tell you that he didn't have confidence that he could properly 
activate the alarm?
A: No.

Q: Did you explain to him how to do it?
A: Yes.

Q: What did it involve? Punching in some numbers?
A: Yes.

Q: And that's all. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: If the alarm is on and you're inside the home, does the alarm go off? Is 
there any motion detector?
A: There is one, yes.

Q: Where is that located?
A: I would prefer not to say.

Q: Where was it located in June of 1994?
A: I would prefer not to say.

Q: Could you please tell us?
A: No.

MR. BAKER: I will give you that information, and he can write it on a piece 
of paper. Is that fair enough for you?
MR. PETROCELLI: For now. yes.
MR. BAKER: Okay. Just write down where it is.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Just so I am clear, you have only one location in the whole residence 
that's --
A: That's correct.

Q: subject to a motion detector, and when you activate the alarm, the motion 
detector goes on. Right?
A: Pardon me?

Q: When you set the alarm, that also activates the motion detector. Correct?
A: No.

Q: Do you have to also set the motion detector?
A: Yes.

Q: And how -- Can you do that from any of the keypads?
A: No.

Q: How do you set the motion detector?
A: By a pad that's upstairs, in my upstairs hall.

Q: You did give me a description of that pad before when you said you had 
one in your bedroom and one upstairs. Is that the upstairs one?
A: Yes.

Q: Is it a second pad next to the other pad for the doors?
A: Yes.

Q: And that's the only pad that activates a motion detector. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: Do you know how large of an area that motion detector covers?
A: A relatively large area, yes.

Q: Would it cover the kitchen?
A: I m not going to talk about that. I already had to spend a fortune changing 
my alarms, by talking about my alarm system in court.

Q: Have you changed it since the court case?
A: Yes. Made it better.

Q: Well, I am only interested in what it was at the time.
A: Well, some things are in the same place.

MR. KELLY: Could you send it around, so....
MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Did you have Mr. Kaelin -- Withdrawn. Did you activate the motion 
detector  before you left the premises?
A: No.

Q: Did you ask Mr. Kaelin to do so?
A: No.

Q: You only told him to do the doors. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: Now, why on this one occasion for the first time ever did you ask Kato 
Kaelin to activate the alarm?
A: Because on this one occasion for the first time ever Kato was, as far as I 
know, present when I was leaving and concerned about something around 
the house. Since he was there, I told him to look for a flashlight, investigate 
whatever he was investigating and put my alarm on.

Q: Were you concerned about what Kato Kaelin was describing to you?
A: Not really, but he seemed to be concerned.

Q: You were not concerned?
A: Not really, but he seemed to be concerned.

Q: Why were you not concerned?
A: Because I had to go. I was concerned about making my flight.

Q: He told you that there were some noises and maybe he felt an earthquake. 
Right?
A: Yes.

Q: And he wanted a flashlight to go investigate who might be in the property. 
Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: And you were not concerned that there might be somebody there?
A: Well, my alarm goes off many times. I'm a person who gets up in the 
middle of the night every night and walk around my house. I hear noises all 
the time. If he was concerned, he could look and put on my alarm when he 
left.

Q: Did he describe the noises to you?
A: As I told you before, no.

Q: Well, you saw Kaelin for the first time when you came downstairs after 
you completed getting dressed, brought your Louis Vuitton bag and went out 
to the front entryway.

MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. We've been through that sequence about 10 
times.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am not going to go through that sequence. I am trying 
to establish his conversations with Kaelin --
MR. BAKER: Ask him.

MR.PETROCELLI: I want to make sure, though, in point of time that we are 
talking about the same time.
Q: Is that correct, that you first spoke to Kaelin at that point in time?
A: No, that's not correct.

Q: When did you first speak to Kaelin?
A: I believe it was at 2:00 o'clock that day.

Q: I am sorry.I am only talking about the evening of June 12th.
MR. BAKER: After they get back from McDonald's?
MR. PETROCELLI: Exactly.

Q: Now, my question is: After you got back from McDonald's, you saw 
Kaelin for the first time when you came down finally from your bedroom 
with your bags packed, dropped them in the entryway. Then you saw 
Kaelin. Correct?
A: I saw him, yes. An hour or so -- I'd saw him when we had come back 
from McDonald's, and then the next time I saw him I was about to leave, 
about a hour later or so.

Q: I didn't understand what you just said. An hour or so after you came back 
from McDonald's you saw him
A: Yeah, whatever -- yeah, when I was about to leave.

Q: The time that I just described to you is about an hour or so after you came 
back from McDonald's? Is that what you're saying?
A: Roughly, yes.

Q: So you left around 11:00 o'clock, so you are saying you came back from 
McDonald's around 10:00 o'clock?
A: I didn't say anything. We got back from McDonald's at whatever time we 
got back from McDonald's, and an hour or so after that I was leaving and I 
saw Kato.

Q: But you were leaving around 11:00 o'clock p.m. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: So you came back from McDonald's around 10:00 o'clock p.m. Correct?
A: Maybe a little earlier than 10:00 o'clock p.m.

Q: How early?
A: 1 wasn't keeping time at the time. I was not paying attention to the time at 
the time to that extent. All I know, I told Kato that I'd be leaving and the 
limo would be here in about an hour. I do recall us having a conversation 
when we got back from McDonald's. So an hour or so after Kato was there, 
and I saw him when I was trying to leave.

Q: And I am trying to fix precisely the point in time that you saw him an hour 
or so after you came back from McDonald's, and my question --
A: I thought we fixed that yesterday.

Q: My question to you is: You saw him for the first time an hour or so after 
McDonald's when you came down ready to leave.
A: Correct.

Q: Now, you were in the entryway, and where was Kaelin?
MR. BAKER: We have been through this.
MR. PETROCELLI: I have not --
MR. BAKER: Yes, you have. You went through it yesterday --
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker --
MR. BAKER: Yes,you did.You talked about it, and he told you he was over 
in the garage, and you went through it in excruciating detail.
MR. PETROCELLI: No, I did not.
MR. BAKER: Yes, you did, and we are not going to go through it again.
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to have to ask him some questions about his 
conversations with Kaelin.
MR.BAKER: You have asked him about every conversation he had with 
Kaelin after--when he came down out of his house that night. We are not 
going to go through it again.
MR.PETROCELLI: You know, you are just going to prolong this; that's all.
MR. BAKER: Well, you are not going to try to trip him up by asking him 
the same question 15 times. That's not appropriate conduct at this 
deposition.
MR. PETROCELLI: I am trying to get the truth. I am not trying to trip him 
up. If he is telling the truth, he won't be tripped up.
MR. BAKER: I don't need a lecture from you about what the truth is or 
anything else.
MR. PETROCELLI: l don't need to listen to pejorative descriptions of why 
I'm doing..
MR. BAKER: Pull it up. Let's see --
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not interested in pulling it up.
MR. BAKER: I don't care what you're interested in . Pull it up. He is not 
going to answer another question until we pull it up.
MR. PETROCELLI: You can pull it up. I am going attach the next exhibit in 
order. Okay?
MR. BAKER: Pull it up. Let's see what he asked about yesterday.
MR. PETROCELLI: I intend to pursue conversations with Kaelin right now. 
Can you attach this as Exhibit 27 and this is Exhibit 28. Okay?

(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 27 and 28 were marked for identification by the reporter 
and are attached hereto.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Okay. You have before you Exhibit 27, Mr. Simpson?
A: Correct.

Q: And Exhibit 28. You can look at them together.These are sketches of the 
Rockingham property. Do you see that?
A: Right.
Q: When you came downstairs for the last time to leave and you saw Kaelin 
for the first time, I want you to point out on either one of these, whichever 
one you think is better, where Kaelin was and where you were.
A: I was here (Indicating), outside of what you call an entry. I call it a foyer. 
But in this area here, which I will call the entry. And he was somewhere in 
this area here (Indicating).

Q: Okay. I am going to put an OJS" where you were. Correct?
A: Uh-huh.

Q: And Kato Kaelin was where?
A: Somewhere over here (Indicating). He was moving around, but 
somewhere over there.

Q: Right around there?
A: Yeah, in that area.

Q: Okay. I'll put a "K there. And that's --
A: In front of the -- he was in the front of the limo, which was straddling this 
(Indicating). He was in the front portion of the limo, but he was moving 
around.

Q: Where was the limo?
A: Straddling right where it says there.

Q: Right here (Indicating)?
A: Yeah.

Q: Okay. And were there any other cars parked there?
A: Yeah. My Bentley was right there (Indicating).

Q: Right in this little area here?
A: Yeah.

Q: Okay. I will put Bentley. You see that?
A: Uh-huh.

Q: And can you spot the Bronco for us?
A: It would be out here (Indicating).

Q: Right here? Just north of the --
A: Yeah.

Q: -- gate?
A: North of the gate at some point, yeah.

Q: Were there any other -- You had said yesterday that you took a walk from 
Rockingham through the Ashford gate with the dog. Were there any other 
cars parked on Rockingham or Ashford when you took that walk?
A: Not that I noticed.

Q: Okay.
A: I'm sure Kato's car must have been there, but I didn't notice it.

Q: You didn't see it.
A: No.

Q: What kind of car did he have?
A: I don't know. Maybe it was a Datsun or something like that. I don't 
know.

Q: Now, where was Mr. Park, by the way, when you first spotted Kaelin?
A: I don't know. Somewhere around the limo.

Q: Out of the car?
A: Yes.

MR.PETROCELLI: Let the record reflect, though, we have made notations 
on I guess Exhibit 28.
Q: Correct?
A: Pardon me?

Q: This is Exhibit 28 on which we have made these notations.
A: Yes.
MR.BAKER: It's definitely not to scale.
MR.PETROCELLI: I don't represent that this is to scale.

Q: Now, when you first spotted Kaelin and you guys were talking, did he 
then at some point with you go into the kitchen?
A: Later on, yes.

Q: When you say later on," was that after you went out to, as you testified 
yesterday, the Bronco?
A: Correct.

Q: And when you went out to the Bronco to get I think you said the cell 
phone case and other -- and the windbreaker, when you were doing that, 
where was Kaelin? Do you know?
A: No, I didn't see him, but I assume he was --I can hear him at one point -- 
he was talking to me as I went out.

Q: Did he go out with you?
A: No. And I don't know if he was talking to the limo --I just heard him 
talking as I went out, but I really wasn't focusing on what he was saying, 
and... So he was behind me talking.

Q: And then when you came back--
MR.BREWER: Would you describe --the witness made a circular motion 
with his finger --
MR.BAKER: We are on videotape.
MR.BREWER: We are also making a written transcript, Mr. Baker.
THE WlTNESS: What do you want me to describe?
MR.BREWER:I just want to make sure the record reflects what you are 
doing.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: When you came back from the Bronco and you testified yesterday you 
dropped your items off at the front entryway and then went into the kitchen, 
did Kaelin go with you?
A: Yes, I think he went before me.

Q: He was in the house already?
A: Yeah. We were talking when I came back.

Q: You were talking for a bit?
A: We were moving. I couldn't stand in front of him like you and I are 
talking. I was doing what I was doing, and he was talking to me as we're 
doing it, and at this point in here (Indicating) I was talking about going this 
way and him going the other way, and that's when --I think that's the first 
time I heard about a flashlight, is when I came back--

Q: From the Bronco.
A: Yeah. And I remember asking the limo -- I said, "Does the limo driver 
have one, I believe, or words that to that effect--

Q: Meaning a flashlight?
A: Yes. And he says no, and he may have showed me this little pen 
flashlight he had. And I said, Look in the cupboard in the kitchen. There 
might be one. And that's when I went to my bag, and I think I had a quick 
conversation with Park about my golf bag, and at that point Kato was still 
talking, and I went into the kitchen.

Q: Okay. At no point during this whole encounter with Kaelin outside the 
property did you ever sort of stand face to face, stop and talk. Correct?
A: Not really, no. No.

Q: You were moving around all the time.
A: Yeah.Yeah.

Q: When you went into the kitchen, did you have a face-to-face 
conversation?
A: No. He was -- I think he was looking in the cupboard.

Q: And you were getting a drink of water. Right?
A: Yeah. I was talking to him. I went and got a water, came back, and I was 
just talking to him about, Look there," and I didn't know where else to look 
for the flashlight.

Q: You didn't give him the alarm code at that time. Right?
A: No. As he was walking behind me as we went out and I think I was 
discussing, Well, look for a flashlight, and the alarm is" -- whatever, and I 
said--and he was being Kato, and I said -- you know, I think I said, Ill call 
you, or something, but I know I said, Well, look for the flashlight, and I 
just went and got in the limo.

Q: When the alarm is activated and you are entering the property, entering the 
door to the house, can you tell that the alarm is on?
A: Yes.

Q: On all exterior doors?
A: Not all exterior doors. Doors that there are a pad on and stuff, yes.

Q: Was there a pad outside Arnelle's door?
A: No.

Q: Now, if Arnelle came home later that evening and the alarm had been set 
by Kato, would the alarm have gone off when she opened her door?
A: Unless she disengaged it. No. No, it wouldn't have.

Q: And why is that?
A: Because there is no alarm on her door.

Q: On the exterior door of her guest room, there is no alarm.
A: Correct.

Q: Is that the only exterior room, plus Kato's, not subject to an alarm?
A: No. The other room is not subject to an alarm. All the exterior rooms are 
not subject to the alarm or were not subject to alarm.

Q: The three exterior guest rooms. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: Now, from Arnelle's room, when she enters her room, can she go 
directly from her room to the inside of the home --
A: No

Q: -- through an interior door?
A: No.

Q: It's a free-standing room?
A: Yes.

MR.BAKER: Well, I don't know what you mean by free-standing."
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: What I want to know is: Does she have another room that leads into the 
residence?
MR. BAKER: He answered that.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: The answer is no. Correct?
A: The room that she was staying in at the time does not lead into the 
residence.

Q: So if Arnelle wanted to access the residence and the alarm were on, would 
she at all times be aware of that?
A: I would hope so, yes.

Q: And she would have to look at the keypad and see that it was on. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: Is there a light?
A: Yes.

Q: And she had the code.
A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Now, earlier yesterday you had talked about where the luggage 
was placed, and I just want to make sure I understand. On this entryway area 
there are benches on either side?
A: Yes.

Q: Where I am going to put these X's, there are benches. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: You testified yesterday that you had laid the golf clubs and the golf cover 
bag on one of the benches. Which bench?
A: Originally the southern bench.

Q: Which one is that?
A: This way (Indicating).

Q: This one over here (Indicating)?
A: Yes.

Q: Okay, the southern bench. And then you came down -- Did you move that 
to the northern bench at some point?
A: No.

Q: And you also testified that at some point when you were half dressed, you 
came down and dropped the suit bag on this golf bag. Correct?
A: I don't know if it was on it, but in the same place, yeah.

Q: On also the south bench?
A: A: No, because I took the golf bag off the bench at that time and threw it
down on the ground.

Q: When you brought the suit bag down, you put this golf bag on the floor?
A: Yes.

Q: And then put the suit bag on the south bench?
A: No, I don't know. I may have just -- I may have put the suit bag down 
when I started going through the golf bag.

Q: The Bentley was --
MR. BAKER: We've gone through this whole thing yesterday, and I will 
pull it up because this is getting ridiculous to sit here, and when we are going 
to have our argument on Friday about ending the depo, we're going to pull 
this all back up for the judge when we go back and talk to him.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: The Bentley was facing Rockingham?
A: Yes.

Q: And yesterday you testified about leaving the white golf ball bag and 
another bluish bag. Did you leave that behind the Bentley or in front of the 
Bentley?
A: Behind the Bentley.

Q: Yesterday you testified about chipping the golf balls--
A: Yes.

Q: --and I wanted to know whether, using either one of these, you could 
point to the area where you were doing the golf ball hitting?
A: Right about in here (Indicating). Yeah, the lower part.

Q: I will put an X with a circle on it. Right there?
A: Uh-huh.

Q: And you talked about a big tree. Was that the tree right here?
A: Tree over here (Indicating).

Q: This tree near Ashford. Right? I'll put a T" there. And the golf balls you 
were hitting over the tree were the tree where the T is on. Is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: Did you tell Kato Kaelin to call the police?
A: No.

Q: Or Westec?
A: No.

Q: Did you give -- did you say anything to him about talking to Arnelle?
A: No. Arnelle wasn't home.

Q: When she got home, I mean.
A: No.

Q: Did you take Kato's concerns seriously?
A: Not really.

Q: Why not?
A: Because I didn't.
MR. BAKER: He already answered that.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Because he was Kato. Right?
A: No.
MR. BAKER: Don't. You answered it once, and that's enough.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: When Kaelin told you that he heard these noises, did he say at what time 
he heard them.?
A: No.

Q: Did he tell you whether he just heard them or heard them earlier in the 
day?
A: I assumed it relatively just happened. Just an assumption on my part.

Q: Based on the way he was explaining it to you?
A: Based on that he had not mentioned it to me earlier in the day.

Q: But as best as you can recall, he didn't tell you when it happened?
A: No.

Q: Since you didn't take his concern seriously, why did you give him access 
to your house when you were leaving?
A: Because he seemed concerned and because I wanted him to find a 
flashlight and look around if that's what he wanted to do.

Q: And when you called him from the airport to give him the security code, 
did you discuss with him whether he had investigated the situation?
A: I may have. I may have said, Did you find a flashlight?" I believe he said 
"No.

Q: Did you ask him if he had looked for people on the property or had 
investigated the sounds and noises that had concerned him?
A: I may have said, Is everything all right?" And I'm assuming he said 
Yes." I don't recall specifically. And then he -- I said, Did you set the 
alarm? And he said Yes." That was that.

Q: Wasn't it in this call that you had given him the code?
A: Yes.

Q: So when you said, Did you set the alarm," how was he supposed to 
have set the alarm --
A: Well, I asked him to set the alarm.

Q: Excuse me -- if he didn't have the code?
A: Well, I was then telling him to set the alarm. So he said he would set the 
alarm.

Q: So you didn't say, "Did you set the alarm?"
A: No.

Q: You asked him to set the alarm.
A: To set the alarm.

Q: I don't want you to assume anything. I just want to make sure I 
understand your testimony. Do you recall asking him what had happened 
with his concern about someone -- about hearing noises?
A: I do recall asking him, Was everything okay?"

Q: And tell me what he said to the best of your recollection.
A: Well,you don't want me to assume, so I can't.

Q: Don't assume anything.
A: So I can't.

Q: So you don't recall.
A: I don't recall, no.

Q: At any time before you got on that airplane, did you consolidate any of 
your luggage?
A: Yes.

Q: When did you do that?
A: When we got to the airport.

Q: Did you do that where the limo driver pulled up to get the skycap?
A: Yes.

Q: What did you consolidate into what?
A: I put my balls in my golf bag, and I put balls--and I think I took the 
windbreaker and put it in my golf bag.

Q: Let me back up a bit. You had this bluish bag, right, which had the wind- 
breaker and the new maxfli 100s?
A: Yes.

Q: You took that bag and put it in what?
MR. BAKER: He didn't testify that they were new Maxfli 100s.
MR. PETROCELLI: He testified they were not scuffed.
MR. BAKER: There is a difference.
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.
MR. BAKER: Isn't there?
MR. BLASIER: Yes.
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. I wouldn't know that.
MR. BAKER: I'm looking at you.
MR. KELLY: Were they Balatas?
MR. BAKER: Of course they're Balatas.
MR. PETROCELLI: I wouldn't know that.

Q: Tell me, did you take that bag with the Maxfli 100s and the wind-breaker 
and put it into another bag?
A: Yes.

Q: What bag did you put it into?
A: My golf bag.

Q: Opened up the golf cover bag and put it in.
A: Yes.

Q:  Didn't put it into the golf bag itself, Correct?
A: I may have put the balls in the golf bag. I may have put it in the golf bag. 
I'm not sure about that.

Q: You took the balls out, you think?
A: I think so.

Q:  And you left that other bag, the bluish bag in the golf cover bag?
A: Yes.

Q: Not the golf bag itself. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: And did you take the wind-breaker out?
A: I'm not sure.

Q: You already had another wind-breaker. Correct?
A: No. I had a jacket. I had a jacket. I call it a windbreaker, as you saw, but 
it was a wet coat, but it's -- yeah. it's a different type, though.

Q: That's the one you got from the Bronco. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: Were you carrying that?
A: I believe so. If I hadn't put it in my suit bag, I had it -- I was carrying it. 
One or the other.

Q:  So where did you do this consolidation of the luggage? While the 
luggage was in the trunk?
A: No. I had taken it out of the trunk, and while I was standing out of the 
trunk and some guys were asking me for an autograph standing there, and I 
was doing it while they were standing there talking to  me.

Q: Out of the trunk on the ground?
A: On the ground, yes.

Q: And did you do any other luggage consolidation?
A: No.

Q: What bags did you check with the skycap, and what did you carry
onto the plane? 
A: The Louis Vuitton bag and the golf clubs I checked, and I carried my suit 
bag and my grip.

Q: And how much did you tip the skycap?
A: He said he only had $10 change, so he ended up with a $10 tip.

Q: You gave him a 20?
A: Yes. But he promised me he'd get my clubs on the car.
MR. BAKER: On the plane?
THE WITNESS: On the plane, yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: When you left that limo, you paid Park, too?
A: No. I told him to put 20 percent on the bill.

Q: And you signed it?
A: No. I don't think so, anyway. I normally don't.

Q: Did you use a credit card?
A: No.

Q:  He just billed you. Right?
A: I believe so, yes.

Q: When you left the limo area, what did you do then?
A: Went to the plane.

Q: Went directly in the doors and up to the gate?
A: Yeah.

Q: Did you stop at any trash containers--
A: No.

Q: -- or receptacles?
A: No.

Q: None at all?
A: No.

Q: Did you stop to throw anything away?
A: No.

Q: Did you stop to rest any luggage on there in order to rearrange yourself or 
anything like that?
A: It's a possibility.

Q: When you say that's a possibility, give me your best recollection of
whether you did that or not.
MR. BAKER: If you have a recollection.
THE WITNESS: I don't have a recollection. I just know that it wouldn't
be unusual to stand by the ticket counter, put my bag on something, because 
I know he had people in front of him that he was dealing with, and  I was 
beside him, and I might have put my bag either down or something to get my 
tickets out for him to give me
my baggage claim.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: This is outside, you mean?
A: Yes.

Q: Where the baggage guy works behind that counter?
A: Yes.

Q: So you think you stopped there and rested your luggage?
A: Well, I know I stopped there and I know I went into my bag to get my 
ticket for him to, you know, do what he had to do, so I know that took place 
there. So if there was a garbage there, I could
have been around a garbage there.

Q:  Do you remember putting a bag on the garbage, though?
A: No.

Q: Did you talk to anybody besides the skycap and the limo driver?
A: Everybody who spoke to me, talked to.

Q: Who spoke to you?
A: People.

Q: Can you name them.
A: No.

Q: How many?
A: I don't know.

Q: You mean just fans?
A: Yes.

Q: About how many?
A: I have no idea.

Q: Well, you spoke to Mr. Park and you spoke to the skycap. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: You don't remember the skycap's name?
A: No.

Q: How many fans approached you?
A: I don't know.

Q:  More than 10?
A: Probably, yes. Well, in the course of -- you mean during the course of 
getting from there to the plane?

Q: Yeah, from that point until you got on the airplane.
A: That spoke to me?

Q: Yeah.
A: I don't know. I don't know. Whoever I went by spoke to me.

Q: Did you stop to speak to anybody?
A: Other than -- I didn't -- I can't say I stopped to speak to the two
guys who were there. I might have.  But it wasn't like -- the skycap was 
trying to check my luggage, so I didn't feel as if I was stopping for them. 
They just happened to be there.

Q: Two skycaps?
A: No . Two guys.

Q: Oh, two guys. Did you give an autograph--
A: Yes.

Q: - to both of those guys?
A: I don't recall.

Q:  One or two autographs?
A: I don't recall.

Q: Did you give any other autographs?
A: I believe so, but I--I just believe so yes.

Q: Where did you give those other autographs?
A: I believe at the plane or at the counter of the plane, but I'm not
sure. 

Q: And you made one phone call?
A: Yes.

Q:  Did you make any others?
A: No.

Q: Did you use coins to make the call, or did you charge it to a number?
A: I don't recall.

Q: You have a calling credit card. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: You use it regularly?
A: I believe so, yes.

Q: Bills it to your home phone?
A: I don't know.

Q: Or the OJ. Enterprises' office phone?
A: I would imagine. One of them.

Q: How long did the limo ride take to the airport?
A: I don't know. Not long.

Q: You just made casual conversation with Park?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you complain about anything.
A: Yes.

Q: What did you complain about?
A: Traveling.

Q: Just constant traveling?
A: Yes.

Q: Complain about anything else?
A: No.

Q: Complain about it being hot?
A: I don't think so.

Q: Were you hot?
A: Hot, no.

Q: Were you sweaty?
A: I was wet. I know that. 

Q: From?
A: Jumping out of the shower, running downstairs, getting my thing 
together, getting in the plane -- I mean getting in the limo.

Q:  Did you lower the windows in the back seat?
A: I always do.

Q:  All the time?
A: Yeah. I don't like air-conditioning, so normally I would turn it off if it's 
on, and most limo drivers have it on, and put the window down. 

Q: Dale St.John does that for you?
A: Sometimes, yes.

Q:  You said you always do it.
A: Yes. But I don't need him to do that for me. I don't tell you to let the 
window down. I can let my own window down.

Q: But you tell him to shut the air-conditioning off?
A: No. Sometimes if the sun is hot, he'll have it on when I get in, and I'll 
turn it off.

Q:  Now, did you and Mr. Park discuss Kato Kaelin?
A: Yes, I believe so.

Q:  And tell us what was said.
A: Something about, "Was he nervous? He seemed serious." Words to
that effect.

Q: Who said that? Park?
A: I think Park said, "He seemed serious."

Q:  Serious about what?
A: Whatever he was talking about.

Q: About investigating the property?
A: Yeah.

Q:  And what did you say in response to that?
A: That's when I--I don't know if I said anything, but that's when I think I 
decided to call and make sure he had the alarm.

Q: Was there a phone in the airport -- I'm sorry--in the limousine?
A: I believe so.

Q: And you had your cell phone in your grip in the back seat with you.
A: Yes.

Q:  Did you call from the car?
A: I may have tried.

Q: What is your best recollection?
A: I don't know, but I think I may have tried. I think something might have 
been wrong with the phone. I'm not really sure, but I might have tried.

Q:  On what phone?
A: I don't know. If they had a phone there, I may have tried on their
phone. 

Q: Did you try on your cell phone?
A: No, but I would have once I got to the plane.

Q:  You "would have"' meaning what?
A: If I didn't have time to--if they didn't tell me I had time to call on the 
regular phone, I'd have sat on the plane and called.

Q: No. I am asking whether you used your cell phone in the limousine to 
make that call.
A: I don't believe so. I don't believe so, but I might have. I don't know.

Q: It was working. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: What number would you have called?
A: His number.

Q: And how did you know that number?
A: I would have had to dig my phone out of my bag--phone book out of my 
bag, which I might have done, and that would have been what I would have 
had to do.

Q: You have Kaelin's number in there?
A: I believe so.

Q:  That's what you used at the airport phone?
A: I believe so.

Q: Any other discussion about Kaelin?
A: I don't believe so.

Q:  When he said, "He seemed serious," what did you say?
A: He might have been answering an inquiry of mine.

Q: What was your inquiry?
A: "How was Kato? Did he seem serious to you?" I might have asked that. 
I'm not sure. I just know that was the gist of the -- I can't even call it a 
conversation. It was probably just a quick exchange between the two of us.

Q: Why do you think you asked him that question?
A: Because I hadn't really given Kato much thought when I was leaving, and 
then as I was settling down finally in the car, I started thinking about it.

Q: When you picked up the phone in your bedroom from Alan Park,
what did you say to him?
A: Actually I started talking before he spoke. I just picked it up because I 
thought it was Dale, and I said, "Yeah, yeah, I know I'm running late. I'll be 
right down."

Q: Did you say anything else?
A: If he didn't call me right back, because I thought I might have hung up 
right then and then he called right back, and -- because he had said 
something to me that -- rather tentatively, "I've been here," and I said--I 
guess I said something about, "Yeah, I know. I've been in the shower, but 
I'm coming right down,'' and that was it.

Q: You did not tell him you had overslept. Correct?
A: Absolutely not.

Q: And you in fact had not been sleeping. Correct?
A: True.

Q: When was the last time on June 12 you had slept? When you up that 
morning?
A: I may have dozed a little between -- may have. I was reading and 
watching I think basketball, or whatever was on, and I may have dozed 
somewhat before I went to the recital.

Q: We will get to that later. When you were walking the dog after 10:00 
o'clock p.m. down Rockingham and up Ashford, did you see anybody?
A: First, that's not correct. I wasn't walking the dog down Rockingham and 
up Ashford. That's not correct. My dog went out when I went to the 
Bronco, went and did her doo, and I walked around to the other gate.

Q: You walked the dog from the Rockingham gate to the Ashford gate.
Correct?
A: I walked to the Ashford gate, called my dog to come in at the Ashford 
gate.

Q: Did you see anyone during that time?
A: No, but I heard someone.

Q: Did anyone see you?
A:I don't know.

Q: Did you talk to anyone?
A:No.

Q:  What did you hear?
A:  I heard the doors in my neighbor's yard over here (Indicating). When 
they were moving around, sometimes you can hear them if
they're outside going inside or outside.

Q: And what neighbors are you referring to?
A: The Schlesingers.

Q: Schlesingers?
A: Yes.

Q: Salingers?
A: Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Salingers.

Q:  Salingers.
A: Yes.

Q:  Do they live just north of your property on Rockingham?
A: No.


Q:  Where do they live relative to this?
A: Just south.
MR.BAKER: South of the--
MR.PETROCELLI: Do I have my directions wrong?
MR.BAKER: You do.
BY MR.PETROCELLI:
Q: Okay. So--
MR.BAKER: Here. It's on here. See? South that way (Indicating).
MR.PETROCELLI: Okay. South is where the Rockingham gate is. Okay.

Q: You heard some sounds in the Salinger property?
A: Yes.

Q: They seemed normal sounds to you?
A: Yes.

Q:  Just people going m and out of the house?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you see anyone there?
A: No.

Q:  Did you see cars driving by? At any time when you were out on that -- 
when you went to the Bronco and then walked to Ashford and got your dog 
and went in.
A: I don't recall, no.

Q:  Now, you've heard the testimony of Mr. Park about seeing a person in 
dark clothing in the vicinity of the front entryway and driveway area going 
into the front door. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q:  And you told Larry King that that was you. Correct?
A: I told Larry King that I walked out of my house, and I assume that if he 
saw someone at that point in time it was me, because judging by his 
testimony, right when I got back at the top of the stairs the phone rung, and 
his testimony I guess sort of said that. So that would have been me, yes.

Q:  That would have been you when you came down the stairs half
dressed the first time to put down the suit bag. Correct?
A: Yeah, and to look -- actually I didn't come down to put down the
suit bag. I came down to see if I had black shoes in my golf bag.

Q: And you came downstairs, and you opened that golf bag and looked in 
for your shoes. Right?

A: That's correct.

Q: And that's when you put the golf bag on the floor from the south bench.
A: I actually held it up, thinking that Dale was in the car looking at me, and 
threw it down for -- sort of me signaling to Dale: Come and get the golf bag.

Q: Dale was, you thought--
A: Yeah.

Q: By the way, you didn't know that it was Park. Right?
A: No.

Q: You thought it was Dale?
A: Right.

Q: "Dale" being Dale St. John, your regular--
A: Dale or one of his guys who normally drive me.

Q: Who else normally drives you?
A: You'd have to ask Dale.

Q: You don't--
A: I don't recall their names, no.

Q:  You don't remember their names?
A: No.

Q: Anyway, you signaled to Dale from the front entry area?
A: I picked the golf clubs up and held them up and then threw them down, 
thinking whoever was there, because it's an unobstructed view, would see 
me, and threw it down on the ground;  and if it was Dale or the other guy, I 
thought they would push the gate, come in
and get the bag. 

Q:  Dale knows how to push that gate open?
A: I would assume so. I know he has a tall guy that works for him that 
would have known because I'm sure he's done it before, because they're all 
concerned about not letting my dog get out.

Q: Who is that tall guy?
A: As I told you, I don't know. You'd have to ask him. But he's driven me 
often.

Q:  Dale has come to your property and basically let himself in that Ashford 
gate. Is that what you're saying?
A: I'm saying that many times Dale has come to my property -- I'm
normally getting dressed. I'm normally not the guy that's letting him in -- left 
the--
THE REPORTER: Excuse me. "Left the"?
THE WITNESS:-- have come to pick me up without driving on my
property, come into my property, take my luggage outside of the gate and 
put it in the car. I'm saying that that has happened often.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: And when that happens often, who lets Dale in the gate, or his driver?
A: I would assume Michelle or Gigi or whoever was downstairs at the  time.

Q: My question to you is: Did you tell Dale or this tall driver how to get into 
the Ashford gate--
A: No.

Q:--if no one lets them in?
A: No. I've never told them personally, no.

Q:  You testified yesterday that you know a way in which you can push the 
door manually open. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you ever describe that to the drivers?
A: No.

Q:  Did you ever see them let themselves in without being buzzed in?
A: I've seen them on my property when I'm down, go out that gate with that 
gate going back and forth on the hinge, yes.

Q: And do you know how they got in?
A: Well, normally my housekeeper was down there dealing with it.

Q: On this occasion you knew, on the evening of June 12, there wasn't a 
housekeeper. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: And when you signaled to the driver with your golf bag -- is that
what you're now saying?
MR. BAKER: What do you mean, "now saying"? Don't--
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Is that what you're saying, that you signaled to the driver with your golf 
bag?
A: Start all over again, please.

Q: Okay. You said you came down to the golf bag with your suit bag, put 
the suit bag down someplace --
A: Correct.

Q: -- looked in the golf bag --
A: Right.

Q: -- for your shoes.
A: Correct.

Q: Black shoes.
A: Yes.

Q: Actually picked the bag up and walked out into the driveway area?
A: No.

MR. BAKER: He never said that.
THE WITNESS: I never said that.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You said you held the bag up--
A: I picked it off the bench. I guess they can see me. You want to describe it 
as I'm doing it.

Q: Correct.
A: Picked it up off the bench, held it up and threw it down on the ground 
(Indicating).

Q: Held it up and looked over towards the limousine?
A: Yeah, held it up towards that, because it was I guess parking lights
shining in, and the limo was right there looking at me, and threw it down.

Q: Limo was on the other side of the gate.
A: Yes, but there was no -- it was unobstructed. There was nothing on the 
gate to keep him from looking straight down the whole driveway, for that 
matter.

Q: And you did that, what you just described, in order to signal to him to put 
-- come get the golf bag. Right?
A: Yeah.

Q:  How did you expect him to come into the property to get the golf bag?
A: Well, I thought he would push the gate. If he didn't push the gate, it 
would have been simple: I would have said "Push the gate" when I came 
back down. It was no big deal.

Q: You had never told him about pushing the gate.
A: I never told Kato how to open a door, but I assume he knows how to 
open a door.

Q: Why would you assume that the limousine driver would know how to get 
into a gate that would appear to be closed and locked?
A: Because he had been coming to my house for years, and everyone
else who has come to my house for years know that.

Q: Knows that you can get into that gate by just pushing it?
A: Yes.

Q: But you never told the drivers that.
A: I never told Kato that, but I'm sure if you asked him, he'll tell you that's 
how he came into that gate. I never explained it to him. I've never explained 
it to Gigi, but I'm sure she does it.

Q: And what were you wearing when you did that?
A: Wearing what--when?

Q: What were you wearing when you motioned to the limousine driver with 
your golf club from that entryway?
MR. BAKER: It's a golf bag.
MR.PETROCELLI: Golf bag. Golf bag.
THE WITNESS: I had on pants. I had on shoes.  I had on a robe.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: What color was the robe?
A: I don't know, but it's still in my house now.

Q: And no shirt.
A: And no shirt.

Q: What kind of robe was it?
A: Cloth robe.

Q: White terry cloth?
A: No.

Q: What color?
A: I said it's at my house. It's a darker robe, but it's at my house.

Q: A black robe?
A: I don't think so.

Q: Blue?
A: Possibly.

Q: Was it tied?
A: I doubt it.

Q:  The robe was never taken by the police?
A: Neither were the bath towels. .Neither were the clothes that I were 
wearing.

Q: Which clothes? You mean the clothes you took off?
A: The clothes you asked me about, yes.

Q: The golf pants you took off. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: And the shirt.
A: Yes.

Q: So is it your recollection -- Withdrawn. Did you actually come out
onto the driveway?
A: No.

Q: You're positive of that?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you indicate, Mr. Simpson. by pointing to Exhibit 28 where you
were standing or as far out near the driveway that you came?
MR. BAKER: OJ., just wait until I come down there.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Do you understand the question? Okay. You can wait until Mr. Baker 
returns.
MR. BAKER: And the question is to point where or to make a mark where 
he was the furthest out from the entrance of his front door?
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: During this occasion when you lifted your golf bag to signal to the
limousine driver.

A: This is purely an estimation. There is not much room there. So I would 
say to the westernmost point of -- possibly. I don't know if my body went 
that far, but to certainly in the area to the westernmost point of my benches.

Q: What is the distance from the door to the driveway, to the beginning of 
the driveway?
A: I'd be totally guessing.

Q: 10 feet?
A: 15 feet.

Q: 15 feet. And how many feet were you from the front door?
A: You told me not to assume, so I'm not going to assume.

Q: What is your best estimate?
A: Halfway, three-quarters of the way.

Q: From the front door?
A: Yes.

Q:  So you were at least three or four feet from the driveway?
A: I would say so, yes.

Q:  Okay. I will put a little...
MR. BAKER: What is that--
MR. PETROCELLI: What is that, Mr. Baker? You describe it.
MR. BAKER: No. But I'm saying--
MR. PETROCELLI: It's a cross.
MR. BAKER: I understand that, but what I'm saying, that is not where he 
indicated where he said the furthest most -- the westernmost portion of the 
bench is, and the benches don't go out that far. So that's--
THE WlTNESS: And that's an estimate, the westernmost part of the
benches, but roughly in that area.
MR. BAKER: There are aerial photographs of this property. There's--
MR. PETROCELLI: Do you have any?
MR. BAKER: I do at the office.
MR.PETROCELLI: Maybe you can bring one, and we can be real clear
about it.

Q: Anyway, your testimony is westernmost part of the benches--
A: Roughly.

Q:--three or four feet from the edge of the driveway.
A: Yeah, I would say so.

Q: And standing there upright, a person at the Ashford gate can see 
unobstructed?
A: Upright, yes. I think if I was down -- I used to have a bunch of bushes 
there at the time -- down they would have--probably would have had a little 
bit of a problem, but standing upright they should have had absolutely no 
problem seeing a person there, as they should have had no problem seeing 
anybody along this entire
driveway at this end.

Q: And at this time when you picked up the bag, Kato Kaelin wasn't
around yet. Correct? 
A: Correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: Let's take a short break.
MR. BAKER: Sure.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 10:51.

(Recess.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 11 :15.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to mark as Exhibit 29 the piece of paper
on which Mr. Simpson wrote the area of his house that is subject to the 
motion detector -- was at the time, June 1994. We will omit
this from the transcript. I will just maintain custody of it.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 29 was marked for identification by the reporter [ and 
was retained by Mr. Petrocelli.)

THE WlTNESS: I should write -- never mind.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Mr. Simpson, referring to Exhibit 27, which is another sketch of 
Rockingham, when Mr. Kaelin would access typically his property --his 
room, I should say, would he take this route that goes around the pool to get 
to his front door?
A: No.

Q: Okay. Can you trace how he would go, with the pen?
A: From the front driveway?

Q: Yeah.
A: (Witness complies.)

Q: And what you--where you terminated the line, is that the door to
his room?
A: Yes.

Q: This is Exhibit 27.
A: Actually, I terminated it to the wrong room. That's my daughter's room. 
This is his room. I'll try to put an X there.

Q: Where the "X" is?
A: Yes.

Q: Now, when Kaelin was telling you about these noises, yesterday you 
indicated that he indicated the noises came from the other side of his wall, 
and I just would like you to put a marking there on this sketch so that we 
have a clear understanding.
A: I'm not sure if I indicated that he said the noises came from the other side 
of his walls.  He thought it was -- I thought he was talking about an 
earthquake. So I didn't have any really idea where he said the noises had 
come from, but he was in his room, and he thought we might have had an 
earthquake, and he was concerned about sounds or something, but as I said, 
I wasn't really paying that much attention to him.

Q:  Did Mr. Kaelin tell you where the sounds or noises that he heard or the 
earthquake that he felt had emanated from?
A: I don't believe so, but he may have, but I don't have--I don't really 
know. He just wanted to go look around.

Q:  So you had no idea where on the property that Kaelin heard these
sounds.
A: At that point I don't believe I did, but -- he was talking about an
earthquake, which I don't know where an earthquake emanates from, and he 
wanted -- he seemed to want to look around.

Q: He did not tell you where on the property he believed he might have heard 
a prowler?
A: I don't believe so?

MR. BAKER: He didn't mention a prowler.
THE WITNESS: I don't believe so.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: He did not tell you where on the property he wanted to go investigate with 
a flashlight?
A: Well, he was over by the garage when I saw him. When I was walking, 
he was hanging around by the garage and he had a flashlight. and as I said, 
as I came back in, there was some talk,
and I think I suggested to him, "Well, let's get a flashlight. You walk one 
way, I'll go the other way, and we'll see. "

Q: Which way did you tell him to go?
A: I didn't tell him to go either way at that point. At that point the 
conversation went into the flashlight, and at that point he was going to go 
into the house to see if there was a flashlight.

Q: When you said to him, "You go one way and I'll go the other way," you 
did not designate which ways you were referring to. Is that correct?
A: Well, there's only two ways to go if you're going to go around my
house.

Q: What are those two ways?
A: One way he would normally take.

Q: Correct.
A: And other way is the way to the walkway south of my garage.

Q: And could you trace that route?
A: From?

Q: And then end it with a Y instead of an X.
A: End it where?

Q: Well, start at the garage. And you said there were two ways.
A: Yeah.

Q: Describe what you just said.
A: I said he could walk around my house one way. I'll go the other way, and 
we'll see--

Q:  What's the other way?
A: The walkway. Where do I put the Y, is what I'm trying to ask you?

Q: Well--
A: The back of his front door?

Q: Yes.
A: Okay.
Witness complies.)

Q: So you could actually walk on the south side of the garage?
A: Yes.

Q: The south side of the property?
A: Yes.

Q: And is there a path?
A: Yes.

Q:  And walk all the way to the southern end of the property and then come 
back around. Correct?
MR. BAKER: Well, that's not the southern end.
MR. PETROCELLI: Eastern end.

Q:  You are on the southern end, you are walking along the southern end of 
the property heading east.
A: Yes.

Q: Go towards the eastern tip of the property, head north and come back 
around.
A: There is a fence right here (Indicating).

Q:  Are you describing what existed in June of 1994?
A: I believe so, yes.

MR. KELLY: Dan, can we just agree that we are going to make copies of 
this after we are done marking it?
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. Absolutely.
MR. KELLY: I don't think Mr. Baker is excited about me looking over his 
shoulder.
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think Mr. Baker--
MR. KELLY: It's just hard to follow it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: When you were designating, "I'll go this way; you go the other way," did 
you have in mind that Kaelin would go around the pool area and you would 
go around the garage?
A: We never really got to that point. At that point the conversation went to a 
flashlight.

Q: If you were heading down the property in an easterly direction
starting with the garage and going to the end, are there any gates that you 
have to open before you get to the end?
A: There are gates there, yes.-

Q: Could you mark them?
A: I believe there's one here.
(Witness complies.)

Q: Do you need keys to open those gates?
A: I don't think so.

Q:  Did you at that time?
A: I don't believe so, no.

Q: Were those gates both in working condition then?
A: I don't know.

Q: Do you know what the physical condition of those gates were at that time?
A: No. But I don't think they've ever been locked.

Q:  Do they have locks on them.
A: I don't think so.

Q:  You indicated two gates. Could you letter them A and B?
A: I'm guessing here now. I believe there's one here, and I know there's one 
here (Indicating).
(Witness complies.)

Q:  Now, along that southern path that you just circumscribed, what 
separates your property from the neighbor's property?
A: A fence and some hedges.

Q: And the neighbors are the Salingers?
A: Yes.

Q: And does that fence extend all the way from Rockingham to the end of 
your property?
A: I believe so

Q: Are there any openings in it?
A: I don't think so.

Q: Were there at the time?
A: I don't believe so.

Q:  How high is that fence?
MR.BAKER: From where?
BY MR.PETROCELLI:
Q: What is the height of the fence as it traverses down the southern part of 
your property in an easterly direction?
MR. BAKER: No. But what I'm talking about is: You mean from his 
property or from the Salinger driveway, because it's different?
BY MR.PETROCELLI:
Q:  They are different levels?
A: I really don't know.

Q:  Mr. Baker apparently does.
MR. BAKER: I do.
BY MR.PETROCELLI:
Q: Well, let's just go with what you know for now. Okay? If you--What is 
your estimation of the height of that fence?
A: Four to five feet.

Q: Standing on your property?
A: I believe so, yes.

Q: So it would come up to where on you?
A: I don't know. What's four or five feet on me? I'm six feet tall.

Q:  Two feet from the top of your head. What's on the top of that fence?
A: It's tied off.

Q: Are there any -- Tied off?
A: Yeah, it's like the fence tie.

Q: I see.
MR. BAKER: It's chain link tied off at the top.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Is it jagged?
A: I would say so.

Q:  Have you ever jumped that fence?
A: No.

Q:  On the other side, that is, the southern side of that fence, there are
bushes? 
A: Yeah, trees, bushes, hedges, yes.

Q: All on the Salinger side?
A: I believe so, yes.

Q: And do you know the kind of trees or hedges that are along that
southern path?
A: I know there's some Eugenias. Other than that, I don't know.

Q:  Do they drop leaves down on your property?
A: Yes.

Q: Do they drop anything else?
A: Berries.

Q: What kind of berries?
A: Eugenia berries.

Q:  Have you seen Eugenia berries on that path before?
A: Yes.

Q: Where? The whole path?
A: Wherever the Eugenia trees are.

Q: Where are they?
A: I don't -- well, I don't think there's any west of the driveway, but
I can't--I mean the garage, rather, but I can't tell you where they start  -- 
where they start. I don't really have a memory of where they start.

Q: Now, did Mr. Kaelin indicate to you in any way, shape or form that
he had heard sounds or noises on the outside of his bedroom?
A: I don't recall. I really don't. He was talking about earthquakes and
noises. 

Q: Did he indicate to you that he had heard sounds or noises or earthquakes 
or whatever on that -- in the area of that southern part of your property 
behind the office and the various rooms?
A: I don't recall.

MR. BAKER: That's the fifth time you asked that.
MR. PETROCELLI: You know, Mr. Baker, those comments are not 
helpful, and they're self-serving,  and they are not--
MR. BAKER: And they're accurate, because I am bringing it up over here --
MR.PETROCELLI: They are of no significance to the -- and there is
nothing wrong in asking a question five times if it's appropriate.
MR. BAKER: Well, we differ greatly on that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: There was some talk about getting a flashlight. Are there parts of
your property in the evening that are not illuminated such that you would 
need a flashlight to go look?
A: I would think so.

Q: What parts?
A: I would say this -- probably anything behind Arnelle's room (Indicating), 
what was Jason's room, Kato's room, I would assume that you would need 
a flashlight back there.

Q:  You are now referring to that pathway that you were describing. Correct?
A: Correct.
MR. BAKER: A portion of the pathway, he was referring to.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: From the garage to the end?
A: Yeah. And then there's -- this is not a pathway (Indicating). This is
just a dirt area around there.

Q: As you come around, what is it? Arnelle's room.
A: Yes.

Q: Is there a gate--or a fence, I should say, all the way around?
A: No. Well, what do you mean? Separating my property from others
properties?

Q:  On the eastern end of your property, on the southeast corner as you head 
north here, is there a gate there?
A: As I head north, there is a gate right here (Indicating)--

Q: I'm sorry. Is there a fence?
A: Well, my tennis court fence.

Q: And that goes to where?
A: My tennis court.

Q:  The end here (Indicating)?
A: This (Indicating) is a fence that separates my property from Frank Jobe's 
and--

Q:  Mr. Simpson, referring to the area just east of Arnelle's room here, do 
you see where I'm referring.
A: Uh-huh.

Q: Is this a dirt area?
A: Yes.

Q: So one can walk through that dirt area?
A: Uh-huh.

Q: What is in this area? Anything?
A: Shrubbery.

Q: And does the fence proceed down this far?
A: Yes.

Q: The Salinger fence?
A: Yes.

Q: Goes all the way to the end of your property. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: And what's on the eastern end of your property?
A: Fence.

Q: Coming up north, you mean?
A: Going south, north or south, yes.

Q: And who is on the eastern side of your property? What is on the eastern 
side of your property?
A: Other houses.

Q: Do you know the names of those neighbors?
A: One is Jobe, and the other one I don't know.

Q: Jobe?
A: Yeah.

Q: Okay.
A: The other one, nobody's living there, I should say.

Q: Let's mark that "C," that gate that you said is north of Arnelle's room. 
(Witness complies.)

Q: Are there any other gates on that path that you described?
A: I don't believe so.

Q:  Do you know whether in June of 1994 the gate that you just marked with 
the letter "C" was there?
A: I'm pretty sure it was.

Q: And did it work?
A: I don't know.

Q: Were all three of these gates on their hinges, is what I mean to say, A, B 
and C, in June of 1994?
A: Yeah, I don't think--I don't know. I would assume so, yes. I shouldn't 
assume. I don't know.

Q: Prior to -- At any time on June 12,1994, were you on that path that you 
just described behind the office, Kaelin's room and Arnelle's room?
A: No.

Q: And prior to June 12, when was the last time that you had walked
down that path?
A: I have no idea.

Q: Was it within the last--within a week before?
A: I have no idea. I doubt it, but I have no idea.

Q: Can't remember at all?
A: At all.

Q: Okay. And when was the last time that you had walked down that path 
behind Kaelin's room in the evening when it was dark?
A: I have no idea.

Q: Have you ever done so?
A: All the way down? I doubt it, but I may have.

Q: Do you remember doing so?
A: I think a couple of times I had to climb through the guest house window 
or something when the door as locked and somebody lost their key, possibly 
Arnelle's room maybe on one occasion. I may have had to do that.

Q: So you would have -- from this driveway area, you would have gone 
down past your garage all the way down to Arnelle's room?
A: I probably would have come out of the washroom if I'd have done
that.

Q: Where is the washroom on this?
A: (Indicating). And I -- never mind.

Q: You would have come out of the washroom--
A: I'm just guessing. I mean, I don't--

Q: I don't want you to guess. I want to know the last time that you remember 
at night going down that path.
A: I don't remember what door I -- which way I approached it, no.

Q:  Do you remember going down that path with a flashlight at night?
A: No.

Q: What doors access the property from that path? Starting at the beginning 
of the garage.

A: The door that goes into the garage and the door that goes into my 
washroom.

Q: Can you mark that? Yeah, mark that with an X and a circle. And then 
mark the next one with a Y and a circle.
A: I've already put an "X" there.

Q: Okay, that's fine. You can circle that "X."
(Witness complies.)

Q: You've got two doors there. Right?
A: Yeah.

Q: Your master key works on both of them?
A: I would assume so.

Q: Are there any other doors down the rest of that path?
A: No.

Q: If you come around the property, around Arnelle's room, where is the 
next exterior door? Arnelle's door?
MR. BAKER: Exterior to what?
MR. PETROCELLI: Into any of those guest homes.
THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: And the next one is Kaelin's?
A: No. It's actually this--you've got two Arnelle rooms here, so both are 
Arnelle's room.

Q: Two Arnelle rooms, so two doors to Arnelle's.
A: Yes.

Q: And then the next one is what?
A: Kaelin's.

Q: And then the next one is what?
A: Into my pool--into my family room.

Q:  From the pool area?
A: Yes.

Q:  And could you put a Y and a circle around that.
(Witness complies.)

Q: Does the alarm work on that one?
A: Yes.

Q:  Why don't you finish off the exterior doors for me.
MR. BAKER: They're virtually all on that piece.
(Witness complies.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: What are the markings? X you're making. Right?
A: Y's, X's --

Q:  What are you making? Y's now?
A: Yeah, I guess they're Y's.

Q:  Okay. Keep going.
(Witness complies.)

Q:  Okay. Have you ever jumped the fence from the Salinger property
over onto your property?
A: No.

Q:  Now, yesterday you mentioned that you noticed some blood in the
kitchen when you went to get your drink of water.
MR. BAKER: No, he didn't.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: I don't want to mischaracterize your testimony. I want to go back to when 
you were in the kitchen getting a drink of water, and Kaelin was there and I 
think he was looking for a flashlight in the cupboard.
Do you remember that?
A: Yes.

Q: Now, at some point during that event--
A: Uh-huh.

Q: -- did you notice blood?
A: What I thought was blood, yes.

Q: Was that the first time that you noticed what you thought was blood all 
day long?
A: Yes.

Q: Where did you see the blood?
A: On -- just a drop really on the counter by my sink, and then on this side of 
my hand (Indicating).

Q: Now, for the record, you are referring to the outside of your left pinkie.
A: Yeah. Sort of fingernail area.

Q:  Near the fingernail area?
A: Yes.

Q: You saw the blood on the counter while you were getting the drink of 
water?
A: No. My drink of water's in my washroom, but while I was at the
counter, I did. 

Q: At the kitchen counter?
A: Yes.

Q: What were you there for?
A: Kato was getting a flashlight, and I was drinking a glass of water, waiting 
for him to get the flashlight or talking to him. He was getting the flashlight. 
We were all in motion.

Q:  You saw one drop of blood on the counter?
A: What I thought was, yes.

Q: Small drop?
A: Yes.

Q: Like a pinpoint? How big was the drop of blood?
A: Small.

Q:  How small? You want to draw it for me?
MR. BAKER: No, don't draw it.
THE WITNESS: No. I don't know. Small

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: I want you to describe the size of this blood drop.
A: You know what? I didn't really study it. I just saw what I thought was 
blood and I saw something on my hand, and I just took a Kleenex -- not a 
Kleenex. I tore a part of the roll of paper that I keep  there--

Q: You mean like paper towels?
A: Yes. I just tore a piece off and was talking to Kato.

Q: Okay. Now, when you saw the little tiny blood spot, did you then
look on your body, hands,  whatever, where the blood was coming from?
A: No. I looked at my -- as I said, I had the glass, so I saw it on my pinkie 
finger, and other than that I didn't-- I took a thing and wiped it and didn't see 
anything as I was talking to Kato, and I just continued on what I was doing.

Q:  Did you notice blood also on your pinkie finger?
A: Just what I told you: On the side of my pinkie finger up along near my 
fingernail.

Q:  How much blood did you see?
A: Not much.

Q: A few droplets?
A: I wouldn't know how to describe it, on my finger.

Q:  Was it dripping?
A:  No.

Q: You then got a little piece of the paper towel and put it on to wipe it off?
A: Yeah, kind of--as I was talking to Kato, I kind of did wipe it.

Q:  How big of a paper towel piece?
A: Not much. A tear-off.

Q: A tear-off of a normal-size sheet?
A: Yeah.

Q: What did you do with the paper towel piece that you tore off after you 
applied it to your left pinkie?
A: I assume I -- I'm in the kitchen. I could have thrown it in the garbage or I 
could have thrown it as I went out the front door, because I immediately was 
exiting the house at that time.

Q: You  mean thrown it on the ground?
A: May have, yes.

Q: What's your best recollection of what you did with that piece of
paper towel with the blood on it?
A: I don't have a recollection.

Q:  When you applied it to your finger, did it get completely soaked with 
blood?
A: I don't think so.

Q:  Just dabbed it?
A: I just wiped the blood off, and that seemed to be it. I didn't see any other 
blood.

Q:  Did you see a cut or scrape or an abrasion or anything like that?
A: No.

Q: Any mark at all?
A: No.

Q:  Is your garbage in the kitchen right underneath your sink?
A: Yes.  No, but it's in my kitchen, yes.

Q: When is your garbage thrown out?
A: I don't know.

Q: When does the trash come?
A: I think Tuesdays maybe.

Q:  Tuesday morning.
A: I believe so.

Q:  Who takes it out?
A: Whoever is--From the house?

Q:  Do you ever take the trash out to be picked up?
A: What do you mean? To the street?

Q:  Yes.
A: In my life?

Q:  No. As a regular practice.
A: No.

Q: your maid does?
A: My gardener does.

Q: Gardener.What days did he come in June of 1994?
A: I don't know.

Q:  Every day?
A: I doubt it, no.

Q: What days did the pool man come?
A: I don't know.

Q: You don't know their schedules?
A: No.

Q: Did they have your code?
A: No.
MR. BAKER: Code for the alarm the house?
MR. PETROCELLI: Alarm.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  What was the name of your pool man in June of 1994?
A: It may have still been Paul Brown. I don't recall when he passed, but he 
passed, but he was my pool man for as long as I've had the house virtually.

Q: He passed?
A: Passed away

Q: Recently?
A: I believe so. I can't recall if it was right before this incident or right after 
this incident.

Q: What was the name of your gardener in June of 1994?
A: Gus.

Q: Is he still your gardener?
A: Yes.

Q: What's his last name?
A: I don't know.

Q: What's his company's name?
A: I don't know if he has a company.

Q: Now, when you went into the--when you went from the kitchen out to the 
property, did you drop any more blood?
A: l don't know.

Q:  Did you see any?
A: No.

Q:  When you went into the limousine, did you drop any blood in the
limousine?
A: I didn't see any, no.

Q:  The whole time you were--
A: The whole time.

Q:  Did you say anything to Kaelin about the cut on your finger at that
time?
A: I didn't know if I had a cut on my finger at that time.

Q: Did you say anything to Kaelin about the blood coming from your
finger?
A: No.

Q:  Did he see you apply the paper towel to the blood?
A: I don't know what he saw. He was looking in the cabinet.
 
Q:  His back was to you when that happened?
A: I don't know. He was -- I'm sure -- his back was to me sometimes. He 
was in a cabinet, so his back would have had to be with me. I was in the 
kitchen. I really wasn't paying attention which directions he was looking 
other than the fact that he was looking for a flashlight.

Q:  He never acknowledged to you that he saw the blood. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: Did the limousine driver acknowledge to you that he saw blood?
A: No.

Q:  Did you tell him about the blood?
A: No.

Q:  Did you ask him for a paper towel or a napkin or tissue or  anything like 
that?
A: I didn't need one.

Q: So during the entire limousine drive, you didn't need to apply anything to 
stop bleeding. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q:  And so far as you knew, there was no more bleeding?
A: Yes.

Q: And you did not bleed again until the incident in Chicago that you've 
described yesterday. Is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: So as far as -- So you had no cuts on your body that were bleeding
when you left Los Angeles to go to Chicago. Correct?
A: As far as I knew, correct.

Q: When you went to the Bronco to
get the cell phone case and the windbreaker, did you bleed in the Bronco?
A: Not that I was aware of.

Q: Did you see any blood in the Bronco?
A: No.

Q:  Did you see any blood on the cell phone case or the windbreaker?
A: No.

Q: Did you see any blood on any of the garment bags that you were carrying 
or the luggage bags?
A: No.

Q: Did you see any blood on any other surface that entire evening
other than the counter and your finger?
A: No.

Q: You saw the blood on the side of your pinkie, your left pinkie.
A: Uh-huh.

Q: Did you have any idea how that happened?
A: No.

Q:  Do you now know how it happened?
A: No.

Q: As you sit here now, you have no idea what caused that finger to produce 
a little blood?
A: If it produced the blood, no.

Q: You don't even know if it came from that finger?
A: Correct.

Q: You think you might have touched something that was bloody?
A: I have no idea.

Q: Do you know if the blood that you saw was your blood?
A: No.

Q: You don't know.
A: No.

Q: Did you see anyone else bleeding that evening?
A: No.

Q:  So just to be clear on this, when you looked at your left finger when you 
saw the little blood, you did not see any cuts on it. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q:  And you examined it. Correct?
A: Not really.

Q:  You looked at it enough to see that you couldn't see any cuts. Correct?
A: No. I wiped it, Isaw no more blood, and that was it.

Q: And you didn't see any cuts.
A: No.

Q:  Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: To the best of your knowledge, there were no cuts on your left hand 
when you left the house to go to Chicago. Correct?
A: None that I saw, no.

Q: Correct?
A: Correct, none that I saw.

Q: And none that you were aware of. Correct?
A: Yeah, none that I was aware of, but I knew there was blood on my
finger.

Q: That one moment. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: When you say none that you were aware of, was there any reason to 
believe that you had cuts on your hand?
MR. BAKER: You mean other than the blood on his pinkie?
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You said you saw a little blood on your pinkie, but you looked at it and 
didn't see any cuts.
A: Yeah. I wiped it, and I didn't see any other blood, so--

Q: And there was no blood coming from any other part of your hand.
Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: Or any other part of your body. Correct?
A: As far as I knew, that's correct.

Q:  You say as far as you knew. Did you have reason to believe you might 
have been bleeding without your knowledge?
A: I saw blood on my finger and a drop of blood on my counter. Yes.

Q: That's the only blood you saw all day. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q:  Has it ever happened before where you saw blood on a part of your body 
without seeing a cut?
A: Yes.

Q: When has that happened?
A: Quite often. Someone will say, "Are you bleeding?" Sometimes it's 
something on my golf shirt, and it would be on my golf shirt, and I not see 
where it came from.

Q:  Would you look?
A: If there's a mirror, I can look at my face. If there's not a mirror, I 
couldn't see.

Q: And those times when you saw blood on your body and you did look, 
was there ever a time when you could not tell where it came from?
A: Yes.

Q:  Did that happen often?
A: In my life?

Q:  Five years before June 12,1994.
 A: I don't know about "often," but it's happened.

Q: You would see blood, look, not see a cut and not know where it
came from?
A: Correct.

Q: But believed it was your blood.
A: Yes.

Q:  Did you believe it was your blood there on June 12 that you saw?
A: I didn't think about it, but I assumed it was, yes.

Q:  Did you cut yourself playing golf?
A: I don't believe so.

Q: Did you cut yourself on the cell phone in the Bronco?
A: I don't believe so.

Q:  Did you cut yourself getting the case out of the Bronco?
A: I have no -- I don't know.

Q: Do you think you did?
A: No.

Q: Did you cut yourself swinging those golf clubs on the evening of
June 12?
A: I don't believe so.

Q:  Did you see any blood on the foyer of your house -- of your entryway?
A: No.

Q: Did you see any blood on the driveway of your property?
A: No.

Q: Did you see any blood outside your Bronco?
A: No.

Q:  Inside your Bronco?
A: No.

Q: Did you see any blood inside your bathroom in your bedroom?
A: On the 12th, no.

Q: When was the last time before the 12th that you did see blood inside the 
bathroom?
A: Every time I shave. Normally. Most times I shave.

Q: Do you use a manual shaver?
A: Yes.

Q: Razor blade?
A: Yes.

Q: You usually cut yourself?
A: Yes.

Q: When you do that, you wash away any of the nicks and the blood?
A: Normally, yes.

Q: Did you cut yourself shaving on June 12th?
A: I don't recall.

Q: Did you shave on June 12th?
A: I believe in the morning, I did.

Q: What time?
A: Whatever time I got up. Would have been 5:00, 6:00 o'clock in the 
morning.

Q: To play golf?
A: Yes.

Q: And you shaved?
A: I believe so, yes.

Q: Do you remember applying any tissues or anything to stop any bleeding 
then?
A: I don't ever do that.

Q: What do you do to stop the bleeding?
A: I just wash it. Like I cut myself this morning a little bit here (Indicating) 
and I was bleeding.

Q: You just wash it with water?
A: Wash it with water --

Q: And it goes away?
A: And it goes away, yeah.

Q: You didn't cut yourself -- When you shave, what hand do you use?
A: My right hand, I believe, yes.

Q: You're right-handed. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: And you didn't cut yourself shaving --  excuse me. You didn't cut your 
left hand or finger shaving that morning, did you?
A: I don't believe so.

Q: Were you using any razor blades at all later in the day?
A: No

Q: Were you using any sharp instruments later at all that day?
A: I don't believe so.

Q:  Did you handle a knife at any time on June 12?
A: I don't recall what I had for breakfast or lunch, so I don't know.
    
Q: What about dinner?
A: No.

Q: You had no knife in your hands from about after lunchtime on June 12th--
A: I don't--

Q: -- is that correct? No knife in your hands after lunchtime on June
12?
A: Yes.

Q: That's correct?
A: Yes. I mean, I don't recall if my key chain had a Swiss Army knife on it 
at that time, but it probably did, so I might have had that knife in my hand.

Q: Did you use that knife on your Swiss Army --your Swiss Army knife on 
your key chain on June 12th?
A: I don't recall.

Q: What at that time did you use that knife for, if anything?
A: Scissors. I always use the scissors for strings and for nose hairs.

Q: There's a scissors on that key chain?
A: Yes.

Q: Part of the Swiss knife?
A: Yes.

Q: A little tiny utility knife?
A: That's correct.

Q: What else is there besides a scissors and a knife?
A: A blade--oh, the blade.

Q: A blade and a scissors.
A: Yes.

Q:  Anything else?
A: Toothpick. No -- toothpick possibly.

Q: Metal?
A: No. Plastic.

Q:  Did you use the blade or the scissors or the toothpick on June 12?
A: As I say, I may have used the scissors, but I don't recall.

Q: If you did use the scissors, did you cut yourself?
A: I don't recall, no.

Q: To the best of your knowledge, you did not cut yourself on June 12.
Correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: Did you cut yourself on the airplane going to Chicago?
A: No. When I say, "To the best of my knowledge I didn't cut myself,"  I 
never noticed a cut,  but I knew -- I assumed I was bleeding.

Q: When you say you assumed you were bleeding, now, you bled for a 
second, you wiped it off and you didn't notice any more blood from that 
point on. Correct?
A: I  don't know if I bled for a second. I just know I saw a spot of blood and 
blood on my pinkie.

Q: So a spot of blood, wiped it off, and that was the end of your seeing 
blood that entire day and evening. Correct?
A: Evening for sure. For sure, yes.

Q: Did you see any blood that morning other than when you shaved?
A: As I said, I don't recall, but in that evening, yes, that's the only time I 
saw blood.

Q: When you wiped it off your pinkie?
A: Correct.

Q: Well, just to be real clear on this, the only -- let's talk about the entire day 
of June 12. Other than that one moment when you saw the blood on your 
pinkie, did you see any other blood on your body that day?
A: I can't recall in the morning.

Q: Can't recall?
A: If I saw blood in the morning or not.

Q: When you were doing what?
A: When I shave, I always bleed, so I can't recall in the morning--

Q: Bleed on the face. Correct?
A: Yeah. I mean, you know, it depends how bad it is. It's on my face
and you take it off your face, or my neck, because I got a couple of what I 
call areas that I bleed all the time or a lot when I shave.

Q:  But you just don't remember?
A: Well, it's -- I would say the majority of the time I shave, I bleed.

Q:  By the time you left the house, there would have been no more bleeding?
A: Correct.

Q: And from that point on until you saw the blood on your pinkie, you saw 
no blood. Correct?
A: I don't recall seeing any blood after that, yes.

Q:  Now--One second. You testified yesterday that you called Paula
Barbieri around 10:00 o'clock p.m. to see if she was available to take you to 
the airport.
A: Yes.

Q: Now, you knew that Paula Barbieri was out of town.
A: Well, I assumed she was.

Q: In fact, she had told you that she was going to be either in Las Vegas or 
Arizona. Correct?
A: That's not correct.

Q:  She told you that she was going to be out of town. Correct?
A: That's not correct.

Q: You said you assumed she out of town.
A: Yes.

Q: What was the basis of your assumption?

Q:  And you had tried to call her a number of times before 10:00 o'clock 
p.m. on June 12. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: And at no time did you get in touch with her. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q:  So you assumed that she was out of town. Correct?

Q:  But you called her to see if she could pick you up?
A: Yes.

Q:  In fact you had gone out earlier looking for her, hadn't you?
A: No.

home. Right?
A: No. I was going to, but I ended up not doing it.

Q: You had not spoken to Paula Barbieri all day on June 12. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: The last time you spoke to Paula Barbieri was when? Last time prior to 
June 12.

Q:  And at that time when you last saw her -- when you last spoke to her, 
was it in person or over the phone?

A: Yes.

Q: Did you drop her off there?
A: Yes.

A: P.M., yes.

Q: : Did you walk her up to her room?
A: No.

Q:  And when she--What car did you go to--You went to an event that 
evening, didn't you?
A: Correct.

Q: Was that for the then First Lady of  Israel?
A: It was actually for a hospital, but she was being honored for raising funds 
for a hospital in Israel.

Q:  What was the name of that event?
A: I don't recall right now. Drawing a blank right now.

Q: Where was it?
A: At a private home in Bel Air, Beverly Hills, BelAir.

Q: Whose home?
A: I can't recall right now.

Q: When you dropped Paula Barbieri off at around 11:00 o'clock
from that event, did she tell you that she was leaving town the next day?
A: No

Q:  Did she tell you that she may be leaving town?
A: At that point, no, but we had already discussed it.

Q: You had already discussed that she might be gone the next day.
A: Yes.

Q: And she told you that she might go to Las Vegas or Arizona?
A: Yes.

Q:  Where in Arizona?
A: She didn't mention it.

Q: Did she tell you the purpose of her trip?
A: She may have, but I don't recall.

A: Not at all.

Q:  Did you discuss your plans for June 12, with her?
A: Discuss them, no.

Q:  Did you tell her what you were doing?
A: For the most part, yes.

Q: And what did you tell her?
A: I was playing golf--she knew I was going to play golf and that Sydney 
had a recital.

Q:  How did she know that you were going to play golf?
A: Because she--I always played golf, and I must have mentioned it, 
but I always play golf.

Q: Did you tell her that you were going to Sydney's recital?
A: Yes. I'm sure I did at some point during that week. I don't know if we 
discussed it at all that night. As a matter of fact, I doubt if we discussed it 
that night.

Q:  You had just gotten into town on Friday night, June 10. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: She picked you up at the airport. Correct?
A: Her and the limo driver, but I ended up going with her.

MR.PETROCELLI: That's why I don't play.

Q: What were the stakes you were playing for?
A: On--in this group?

Q:  Yeah, Saturday and Sunday.
MR. BAKER: I don't know the relevance of that. I am going to instruct
him not to answer.

Q: Yeah. She was the only woman you were dating. Correct?
A: Yes, correct.

Q: How long had you been in a monogamous relationship with her as of 
June 11?
MR.BAKER: I assume you mean by "monogamous" that that was the
only person he was dating? Because that's what you just said.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Only person you were romantically involved with.
MR. BAKER: Okay. Fine.
MR.PETROCELLI: Am I missing something, Mr. Baker?
MR. BAKER: Sir, I don't think you've missed a hair on Mr. Simpson's face 
so far. You have redefined tedium.
MR. PETROCELLI: The truth is in  the details.
Q: You may answer.
A: What was the question? I'm sorry.

Q: I forgot.
A: So did I.

(Pending question read as follows: 
Q. How long had you been in a monogamous relationship with her as
of June 11?)
THE WITNESS: I'm a little confused by the question, but if--she's the
only girl I had sex with from -- for probably the previous four weeks.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: When you say "girl," you mean girl or woman?
A: Woman, yes.

you?
A: No.

Q:  Did you discuss it at all with her?
A: Not at all.

Q: Did you make a point of not discussing it with her?
A: No. I don't think I thought about it much.

Q: Did you ever invite Paula to an event where Nicole was?
A: When I wasn't with Nicole, I had no idea where she was gonna be, so 
not knowingly, no.

Q: That's what I meant: Knowingly invite Paula to an event where you knew 
Nicole was going to be. Did you ever do that?
A: Knowingly, no.

Q: Did you ever invite, for example, Paula to any family functions where 
Nicole would be?
A: No.

Q: You considered this recital for Sydney a family function. Correct?
A: Partially, yes. Yes.

Q: Partially? What do you mean by that?
A: I didn't think about it. I just wanted -- if Sydney would have been
the fifth thing, I would have been in and out of there in 10 minutes. That was 
what I was thinking: Getting in and out of there.

Q: Why were you thinking of just getting in and out of there?
A: Because I was tired, and I just wanted to go to it and get in and out of 
there.

Q: Did you know what order she was on the program?
A: No.

Q: What order--what number was she?
A: 30-something.

Q:  Out of how many?

Barbieri. Right?

A: In a way, yes.

Q:  Explain that.
A: There was a big house, and we were talking about, you know, these 
people, how many kids you can put in a house that big.

Q:  You mean -- I think I asked you. I don't remember your answer.
Whose house was it?
A: I don't recall.

Q: That's the house you're referring to. Right?
A: Yeah.

Q: You and she were talking about having a houseful of kids?
A: It wasn't a serious conversation. It was just about the house, and we were 
feeling good and we were being very romantic, and we were just talking 
about filling a house up like that with kids.

Q: Did you have any romantic involvement with her that evening?
A: No, other than hugging and kissing, yes.

Q: Kissed her goodbye?
A: I kissed her all the time we were in that place.

Q: In the residence?
A: At the affair, yeah. It was very romantic.

Q: When you went back to Rockingham that evening--First of all, any
particular reason why you and she didn't spend the night together?

A: I was tired and I was going to get up early.

Q: Did you have an argument about that?
A: Not at all.

Q: An argument about your getting up early to play golf?
A: We didn't have an argument, no.

Q: A discussion?
A: No.

Q: No conversation about it?
A: No.

Q:  Did she tell you that she wished you didn't play golf the next morning?
A: No.

Q: Did she suggest that to you in any way?
A: No. She didn't, no.

Q:  Who did?
A: Nobody did.

Q:  Did you -- When you left Miss Barbieri that evening, you had no
sense that anything was wrong with your relationship. Right?
A: No.

Q: That's incorrect?
A: I think I said "No," didn't I?

Q:  Meaning my statement was correct. Is that right?
A: Correct, yeah.

Q: And the next morning--When you got back to Rockingham that
evening, did you go to bed?
A: Yes.

Q: Right away?
A: Yes.

Q: And when did you get up? 5:30?
A: 5:00 or so the next day, 5:30 maybe.

Q: And you made breakfast for yourself?
A: No.

Q: Did you eat breakfast?
A: May have.

Q: Where?
A: At the club.

Q: What time did you leave your house?
A: I don't know.

Q: About what time?
A: 5:30, 6:00 o'clock 6:15 maybe. I don't know.

Q: That evening you were alone in the house. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you--
A: That evening?

Q:  I'm sorry. That morning--Well, the evening before, on Saturday evening 
when you went to bed, you were alone in the house. Right?
MR.BAKER: When you say "the house," are you including Kato's and 
Arnelle's room? No?
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me clarify.
Q: When you went to bed the evening of June 11, there was no one in
your home that evening except for Kaelin in his guest house and Arnelle in 
hers. Right?
MR. BAKER: If she was there. I don t know--
THE WITNESS: I don't know if they were there.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You have no idea if they were there. Right?
A: Yes.

Q:  They come and go as they please without having to go inside the

stretching.

A: Yes.

Q: And when you got out, did you put on a robe, or did you put on
clothing?

EXAMINATION (Resumed)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Mr. Simpson, I noticed you are taking some notes on that paper in
front of you. Is that what that's for?
A: Pardon me?

Q: Are you taking notes there?
A: No, but I put some notes down here. I don't know if it's a note. It was a 
sort of a diagram.
MR. BAKER: He was diagramming a golf hole for me this morning before 
we started.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: What's that paper there for?
A: I don't know. He -- your camera guy put it there.

Q: Okay. So that's just doodling. Right?
A: Well, I'm just--I designed a golf hole that he's going to play, a course 
he's going to play, and I was telling him about a hole that's on that golf 
course.

Q: Giving him an unfair advantage. Okay. You remember talking to 
Detectives Vannatter and Lange on June 13?
A: Yes.

Q: They were questioning you about your whereabouts and so forth?
A: Yes.

Q: Now, didn't you tell Detectives Vannatter and Lange on June 13 that you 
cut yourself on your left hand prior to leaving Chicago?
A: I may have said that, yes.

Q: You told them that. Correct?
A: I may have, yes.

Q:  And you told them that because it was true. Correct?
A: I told them that because I saw blood and I assumed it came from
me, yes.

Q: And you thought you had cut yourself before leaving to Chicago
on the evening of June 12th. Correct?
A: I had assumed I had, yes.

Q:  That's what you believed. Correct?
A: That's correct.

Q:  That's what you believed when you told that to Vannatter and Lange. 
Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: You were examined by Dr. Baden on June 17th. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: And he examined you. He examined your left hand. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: And didn't you tell Dr. Baden during that examination on June 17th that 
you cut yourself on your left hand before leaving for Chicago?
A: I don't recall saying that to him.

Q: May I ask you a question off the record?
MR. BAKER: Sure.

(Discussion held between the witness  and counsel outside the hearing of the 
reporter.)

MR. BAKER: Go ahead.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You're not saying you didn't say that to Dr. Baden. Correct?
MR. BAKER: Well, any communication he had with Dr. Baden is protected 
by the physician-patient privilege, and I am going to instruct him not to 
answer about anything he talked to
Dr. Baden about.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  You heard Dr. Baden testify to this in open court, didn't you?
MR.BAKER: You can answer what you heard Dr. Baden testify to.
THE WlTNESS: I heard him talk about that day, yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  And you heard Dr. Baden testify that you told him that you had cut your 
hand in Chicago -- in Los Angeles on June 12 before leaving  for Chicago. 
Correct?
A: That I may have thought I had, yeah. Yeah. Words to that effect. He 
didn't say exactly what you just said, but, yes, words to that effect.  Yes.

Q: And you told that to Dr. Baden because you believed that was true
at the time. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: Now, you also were examined on June 15th by Dr. Huizenga. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: And he examined your left hand, among other things. Correct.?
A: I believe so, yes.

Q: And he testified at trial about this examination in your presence in
court. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: And you heard Dr. Huizenga state that when he examined you, he found 
seven separate abrasions on your left hand. Correct?
MR. BAKER: I'm not going to let him testify as to what he heard. That's 
irrelevant and immaterial to any issue in this case. You can ask him a 
question, but he is not going to answer that
question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Did you hear him so state?
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that, OJ.
MR. PETROCELLI: On  what ground?
MR. BAKER: On the ground it's irrelevant, as to what he heard in the trial, 
and that has nothing to do with any issue in this case. What was testified, 
maybe, but not what he heard.
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I disagree.
MR. BAKER: Okay.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Did you hear Dr. Huizenga testify also that you had three cuts on your left 
hand?
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that either.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Did Dr. Huizenga, when he examined you, point out to you that you
had seven abrasions on your left hand?
A: No.

Q: Did he point out to you that you had three cuts on your left hand?
A: No.

Q: Did you see that you had seven abrasions on your left hand?
A: No.

Q:  Did you see that you had three cuts on your left hand?
A: No.

Q:  Do you deny that on June 15th you had seven abrasions on your left 
hand?
A: Uh-uh. If that's what he said. I don't have any personal knowledge. 

Q: If that's what he said, you don't have any reason to believe he was
lying. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: And if that's what he said, you would assume that that's true. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q:  When Dr. Huizenga said that you had three cuts to your left hand, you 
would have no reason to doubt that. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: And you would assume that he was telling the truth. Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: Now, you had these seven abrasions on your left hand before you
went to Chicago. Correct?
MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. He has testified that he has no 
recollection of having seven abrasions, and now you've said that they exist 
because of your alleged foundation, and you better establish it from this 
witness before you make that fait accompli in your question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You had seven abrasions on your left hand before you went to Chicago 
on June 12. Correct?
A: I can't answer that.

Q: Why not?
A: Because I didn't notice seven abrasions at all when I left for Chicago.

Q: Did you look at your hand closely?
A: Not before I left, no.

Q: So you don't know one way or the other whether you had seven 
abrasions. Correct? Let me sharpen my question. You don't know one way 
or the other whether you had seven abrasions on your left hand before you 
went to Chicago on June 12th. Correct?
A: I don't know how to answer that. That day, no.

Q: Is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And you don't know one way or the other whether you had three or four 
cuts on your left hand before you went to Chicago. Correct?
A: I didn't see them.

Q: Are you saying you did not have those cuts on your hand?
A: I'm saying I didn't see any cuts on my hand.

Q: Are you confident that you did not have three or four cuts on your
left hand before you went to Chicago?
A: I'm confident that I did not see any cuts on my hand when I left for 
Chicago.

Q: Are you saying you could have had those cuts but not noticed them?
A: Anything is possible.

Q: Did you examine your hand for those cuts?
A: Not really,  no.

Q: So you are not saying that you didn't have the cuts on your left hand. 
Correct?
A: I'm saying I did not see any cuts on my hand.

MR. BAKER: That's argumentative, "you are not saying." He has answered 
your question. Don't answer that, the last one.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You cannot say that you did not have the cuts on your left hand.
Correct?
A: I can say I did not see any cuts on my hand.

Q: My question is: Can you say one way or the other whether you had
the cuts?
MR. BAKER: That's argumentative, and he has told you what his--what he 
has a recollection of and what he saw, and that's argumentative in view of 
what he has told you, and I'm not going to let him answer that. I instruct him 
not to answer.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Can you positively say that you did not have those cuts, three or four cuts 
on your left hand, before leaving to Chicago on June 12th?
A: I can positively say I did not see on June 12th, looking at my hand, any 
cuts.

Q: But you don't know whether you had them--
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: --is that correct?
MR. BAKER: You've asked it now 15--
MR. PETROCELLI: He's answering his question, not mine.
MR. BAKER: Because you don't like the answer doesn't mean he's not
answering your question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
You said you did not see three or four cuts. Correct?
A: That's correct.
 
Q: On your left hand before going to Chicago on June 12. Right.
A: That's correct.

Q: Did you look closely at your left hand sufficient to know whether or not 
you would have such cuts?
A: I looked at my hand to see if there was a cut because I thought I was 
bleeding, and did not see any cuts.

Q: Did you examine the entire left hand?
A: I don't know. I looked at my hand. I think I can see my whole hand when 
I look at it.

Q: How long did you look at it?
A: I don't know.

Q: More than five seconds?
A: I don't know.

Q: What's your best estimate?
A: I don't have a best estimate.

Q: Did you look at each finger one by one?
A: Probably, yes.

Q: You put each finger up, examined it, then  put the next finger up, 
examined it?
MR. BAKER: Don't--
THE WITNESS: I have no recollection of doing that, no.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Did you examine each finger one by one?
A: I looked at my hand, looking for a cut, and didn't see one.
 
Q:  You looked at your hand as a whole, in other words?
A: Yeah.

Q: Just like you did on the video.
A: Yeah, just like this (Indicating).

Q: Did you turn it around various ways?
A: Probably, yes.

Q: Saw no--
MR. BAKER: Don't guess or speculate. If you don't know, say you don't
know.
THE WITNESS: I don't know.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: And you saw no cuts when you did that.  Is that what you're saying?
A: Yes.

Q: I am going to show you some photographs. 29 was the last one, right, the 
omitted exhibit?
MR. BAKER: Right.

MR.PETROCELLI: Exhibit 30 and Exhibit 31. I'm marking a series of
photographs for the record.  They were all part of the trial record in the 
criminal matter. Exhibit 32, Exhibit 33, Exhibit 34, and I will attach 
photocopies of these exhibits. Exhibit 35, Exhibit 36, Exhibit 37 and Exhibit 
38.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibits 30 through 38 were marked for identification by the 
reporter and are attached hereto.)

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Now, do you recognize these photographs as depicting your left hand and 
finger?
A: I assume so, yes.

Q: You saw these at the criminal trial?
A: Yes.

Q: Let's look at Exhibit 30 for a moment.
A: Yes.

Q: Do you see that's a picture of your left hand?
A: Yes.

Q: And you see the middle finger of your left hand?
A: Yes.
 
Q: You see some cuts there. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: You see two?
A: Yes.

Q: You see one at or around the knuckle?
A: Yes.

Q: And one above the knuckle?
A: Yes.

Q: You had those cuts before you left for Chicago?
A: No.

Q: Correct?
A: No.

Q: Did you look at that part of your middle finger on your left hand to see if 
you had those cuts?
A: Yes.

Q: And you did not?
A: Correct.

Q: And you can positively so state?
A: Yes.

Q: Exhibit 31 shows a close-up of the same two cuts--
A: Yeah.

Q: -- and you can say you did not have them before going to Chicago?
A: Yes.

Q: Exhibit 32 shows--
MR. KELLY: Wait, wait.  Dan if we could -- we need the exhibits just
so--

MR. GELBLUM: Better go slowly.
MR. PETROCELLI: Let the lawyers get copies of your exhibits. Hold on.
MR. KELLY: Are we just marking them all at the same time?
MR.PETROCELLI: Yes, let's mark them all.
(Discussion held off the record.)

MR. GELBLUM: For the record, I'm going to identify the exhibits by their 
trial exhibit numbers. Exhibit 30 was trial Exhibit 516. Exhibit 31, trial 
Exhibit 517. Exhibit 32, trial Exhibit 518-A. Exhibit 33, trial Exhibit 518-C. 
Exhibit 34,trial Exhibit 518-H. Exhibit 35, trial Exhibit 520. Exhibit 36 trial 
Exhibit 1249. Exhibits 37 and 48 18; are also part of trial Exhibit 1249.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Okay. I showed you exhibits 30 and 31 already. Exhibit 32, Mr. 
Simpson, do you see some cuts on the back of your hand below your 
fingers?
A: No.

Q: I am pointing to an area where there appears to be some scabbing. Is that 
scabbing?
A: Yeah, I see what looks to be a tiny scab, yes.

Q: And underneath that as well. Right?
A: I guess so. I can't tell if that's a spot or a scab.

Q: Now, there is a sort of diagonal scab, and then there is a little circular one 
underneath it.
A: Yeah.
MR. BAKER: If that's a scab.
THE WITNESS: Yeah.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Did you receive cuts in these areas of your left hand prior to leaving 
Chicago?
A: No, and I wouldn't characterize these as cuts.

Q: Can you positively say that these marks do not -- are not the result of cuts 
that you received before leaving Chicago--leaving to Chicago? All my 
questions are directed to the evening of June 12 before you went to Chicago.
A: Yes.

Q: Okay? Can you positively say that these areas of your left hand that I am 
pointing to on this picture--
MR. KELLY:  Dan, excuse me, you are going to have to be a little more 
specific--
MR. PETROCELLI: You can't tell from the xerox copies, so--
MR. KELLY: I am saying I think for the record, the video is not picking up 
any of the picture--
MR. PETROCELLI: I understand. That's why I'm trying to describe the 
area. Okay? 

Q: I am pointing to what appears to me to be a scab, without you having to 
accept that characterization, a diagonal line. Do you see that?
A: That looks like a thin scab to me, too,  yes. Doesn't look like a cut, 
though.

Q: And a little area below that, do you see that?
A: Yes.

Q:  Little circular area.  Now, do you recall receiving any marks or cuts or 
abrasions to your hand on June 12 before leaving for Chicago in the areas 
that we just described on Exhibit 32?
A: No, I don't recall.

Q:  Can you positively say you did not have any cuts or abrasions on that 
part of your hand? Yes or no?
A: I can't positively say, no.

Q: The next one is--Do you want to look at these photographs?
MR. KELLY: Please.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: The next one is Exhibit 33, and a picture of your left hand. Do you see 
that?
A: Yes.

Q: And do you see another scabbing on what appears to be your thumb?
A: Yes.

Q: You cut yourself or abraded yourself on your thumb in the area that I'm 
pointing to on Exhibit 33 prior to leaving for Chicago on June 12?
A I can't say that, no.

Q: Can you positively say you didn't?
A: Positively say I didn't?

Q:  Yes.
A: With this, no. You mean before June 12, any time before I took the 
plane? No, I can't say. I can't say.

Q: Before you left for Chicago on June 12.
A: No. No, I couldn't positively say.

Q:  Do you remember having a cut on your hand on June 12th--
A: No, not at all.

Q: -- in that location on your thumb?
A: Not at all.

Q: Exhibit 34 shows the two cuts we saw before, Mr. Simpson, on the left 
knuckle and above the left knuckle?
MR. BAKER: Put it down so I can see it, because of the glare. Sorry.
THE WITNESS: Yeah.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: I don't have to ask you about that again.
MR.BREWER: Just for the record, the reference was made to "knuckle," 
and I think we've been mistakenly using that interchangeably with "joint." 
Are you talking about--
MR. PETROCELLI: Joint.
MR. BAKER: It doesn't matter once we have a picture, I don't think.
MR. BREWER: Just for the record, though, just to make it clear--
MR. PETROCELLI: That's why I'm showing the pictures.

Q: Exhibit 35, you see a picture of your finger?
A: Yes.

Q: You see a cut on the side of that finger?
A: Yes.

Q:  Pretty deep cut?
A: I don't know.

Q:  Did you receive that cut on the evening of June 12 before you went to 
Chicago?
A: No.

Q:  Are you positive?
A: Positive.

MR. LEONARD: Was that 34, the last one?
MR. BAKER: 35.
MR. PETROCELLI: That one was 35.
MR. LEONARD: Okay.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  I am showing you Exhibit 36.
A: Yes.

Q: You see the picture of your middle finger on your left hand?
A: Yes.

Q:  And below the joint you see some scabbing.
A: No.

Q: What is that colored area?
A: Hair.

Q: Do you see any scabbing at all?
A: No.

Q:  Did you have any injury to your --Did you have any cut to your middle 
finger below the joint before you left for Chicago on June 12?
A: No.

Q:  Are you sure?
A: Positive.

Q: Exhibit 37, a shot of the same  middle finger. Do you see that?
A: Yes.

Q:  And again I am going to point to this  area below the joint, as in the prior 
picture, and ask you whether in these darker colored areas if that shows a 
scabbing or a scarring or any
kind of cut--
A: No.

Q: --or abrasion.
A: No.

Q:  And you didn't have one there before you went to Chicago?
A: No.

Q: Lastly, Exhibit 38 shows the side of what finger?
A: I don't know.

Q:  Middle finger to your left hand?
A: I don't think so.

Q: What finger do you think that is?
A: I think it's this finger (Indicating).

Q: The fourth finger next--
MR. BAKER: Ring finger.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Ring finger.
A: Yes.

Q: And there is a cut on the side of that?
A: Yes, there appears to be a--yes. Yes.

Q: And did you have that cut before you left for Chicago?
A: No.

Q: You sure?
A: Positive.

MR. KELLY: Dan, do you have 37 and 38 there?
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. I want to show them all to him in the next 
question.
MR. KELLY: Yeah, I just want to see them real quick.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Mr. Simpson I am going to hand you back exhibits 30 to 38, and if you
would just look at the color photos. Can you, by referring to those pictures, 
tell me what cut or cuts on your left hand you were referring to when you 
talked to Detective Vannatter and Lange on June 13 when you say that you 
were bleeding before you went to Chicago on June 12th?
A: None of them.

Q:  Are you positive?
A: Yes.

Q:  When  you were referring to bleeding--
MR. KELLY: I am sorry. Could we have the last question read back? I was 
looking at 

(Question read as follows:
Q. Mr. Simpson, I am going to hand you back exhibits 30 to 38, and if you
would just look at the color photos. "Can you, by referring to those
pictures, tell me what cut or cuts on your left hand you were referring to
when you talked to Detectives Vannatter and Lange on June 13 when you 
say that you were bleeding before you went to Chicago on June 12th? ")
MR. KELLY: The answer?
MR. PETROCELLI: ''None."

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  What cuts were you referring to Detectives Vannatter and Lange when 
you said you were bleeding before you went to Chicago?
A: I was referring to the blood that I had seen.

Q: Can you point to the pictures where the blood was? You can just point out 
what exhibits you're using.
A: Point out?
MR. BAKER: It's 30 that he is looking at.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You are looking at 30 now, Mr. Simpson?
A: Yes. Yes. It was on my finger and it was on the side of my hand, my 
baby finger.
MR. PETROCELLI: Let the record--
THE WITNESS: It was on my fingernail a little bit and along the side of my 
baby finger.
MR.PETROCELLI: The pinkie on the left hand he is referring to on the
outside of it.

Q:  Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: Up near the thumbnail--the fingernail?
A: Correct.

Q: And that is the only finger that you had in mind when you were referring 
to bleeding when you spoke to Detectives Vannatter and Lange. Is that right?
A: I wasn't really thinking about the finger at the time, but I was thinking
about the blood but that's what I was referring to.
MR. BAKER: That's the location he was thinking about.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: And that is the only finger that you were thinking about when you were
telling Dr. Baden that you were bleeding before you went to Chicago. Is that 
right?
A: I wasn't thinking about any finger. I was thinking about I was bleeding 
that day.

Q:  At the location of that finger?
A: Well, you know, I was just thinking about the blood. I wasn't thinking
about any specific finger. I don't know if he asked me what finger. I'm  
not sure if he did or didn't.

Q: The blood you were thinking about was the blood located on that
finger. Right?
A: Yeah. On the counter and on that finger, yes.

Q:  Now, where did you get all of the cuts that are shown on exhibits 30 to
38?
A: I'm not so sure of that, but I know it was after that day.

Q: Why do you know it was after June 12?
A: Because on June 13th the police and a police nurse and I looked at
the hand.

Q: Who looked at the hand?
A: Nurse Peratis  and Detective Lange and a Detective Vannatter.

Q: And this was at the time you were being questioned?
A: Yes.

Q: And none of those cuts were on your hand?
MR. BAKER: Well, excluding the cut from the glass.
MR. PETROCELLI: Wait a second, Mr. Baker. He didn't say that. You 
can't-- that's really inappropriate. Mr. Leonard tells Mr. Baker. Mr. Baker 
tells the witness. Cross-examination on a crucial point.
THE WITNESS: It's a simple--
MR. PETROCELLI: It's highly inappropriate.
MR. BAKER: You can put anything you want on the record.
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, Mr. Baker, in fairness it's not appropriate, and
you know that, and if I did that, you'd jump all over me.
MR. BAKER: Not me. I'd never jump all over you, Mr. Petrocelli.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Now you're telling me that when you and Nurse Peratis, is it?
A: That's correct.

Q: --and Detective Vannatter and Detective Lange--
A: Correct.

Q: --met on June 13 at the police department--
A: Correct.

Q: --and looked at your left hand--
A: Correct.

Q: --none of those cuts was there.  Correct?
A: Except for the cut from the middle finger from the glass, obviously,
because that's the only reason Nurse Peratis was there, was to dress that 
wound. There was none of these things on this other finger and stuff was 
not there, and they inspected my hand.

Q: Now, Mr. Simpson, you said yesterday in your testimony that there
was only one cut on the back side of your middle finger.
A: Correct.

Q:  Now, looking at those photos, can you point out--Withdrawn. That was 
the cut you sustained in Chicago when you hit the glass or did something to 
that glass by pushing it aside. Do you remember?
A: That's correct.

Q: Now, point out to me on any one of those--
A: Right here (Indicating).

Q: --what cut you're referring to.
A: This one (Indicating).
MR. PETROCELLI: Let the record reflect that the witness on Exhibit 30 is
referring to the cut above the joint. Right?
A: Uh-huh.

Q: Now looking at 31, you see two cuts, and you are only referring to the
lower one above the joint. Correct?
A: That's the only one I saw, yes.

Q:  And that's the only one that Nurse Peratis dressed?
A: He cleaned it and he dressed it.

Q: Okay.
A: And that's the only one he cleaned and the only one he dressed.

Q: Did you tell Dr. Huizenga on June 13 that you only had one cut on your 
hand when you came back from Chicago, and it was the cut that you just
identified on exhibits 30 and 31?
A: No.

Q:  Did you tell that to Dr. Baden on June 17?
A: No.

Q: Did you withhold that information from them?
MR. BAKER: That's argumentative. Don't answer that.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's not meant to be argumentative.
Q: What I am asking you is if you made a decision in your mind not to
tell them that
A: Not to tell them what?

Q: That you only had one cut coming back from Chicago on your entire
left hand, and it was the one that you just pointed out on exhibits 30 and 31.
A: I didn't have to tell them. They were addressing my hand.They were
addressing whatever was on my hand. I didn't discuss it with them, what
came from where, certainly not with Huizenga.

Q: Now, but you were addressing to Drs. Huizenga and Baden how you
got some of these cuts, didn't you?
A: No.

Q: And that you got some of them before you went to Chicago. Right?
A: That's not correct.

Q: You told them about bleeding before you went to Chicago. Right?
A: Correct.

Q: And you even told them how you thought you got those cuts. Right?
A: In Chicago?

Q: No. Before Chicago, at your house--
A: No, I didn't.

Q: --on the evening of June 12.
A: That's incorrect.

Q: You said nothing of the sort to them?
A: Exactly.

Q:  Did you tell Drs. Baden or Huizenga that while preparing to go
to Chicago, at some point you went to the Bronco to get a phone and maybe
other material and you also did things around the house in the kitchen, and at 
some point you noticed some blood?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you tell them that you got cut in the Bronco?
A: No.

Q:  And did you?
A: I don't know.

Q: Are you positive that you did not get cut in the Bronco?
A: I'm not positive either way.

Q: You're saying you might have gotten cut in the Bronco?
A: As you said earlier, anything is possible.

Q: I didn't say that. I think Mr. Baker said that.
MR. LEONARD: You did?
MR. BAKER: I didn't say that.
MR. PETROCELLI: You said that to me yesterday.

Q: Can you positively exclude cutting yourself in the Bronco and dripping 
blood in the  Bronco?
A: Positively?

Q: Yes.
A: No.

Q: Can you positively exclude dripping blood on the driveway at the
Rockingham gate leading up to your front door?
A: Positively?

Q: Yes.
A: No.

Q: And can you positively exclude dripping blood on your foyer in your
front entryway?
A: Positively?

Q: Yes.
A: No.

Q: Now, are you saying that you got some of the cuts that we have seen in
these photographs after you got back from Chicago?
A: Obviously, yes.

Q: When you say "obviously," I don't know what that means, but the 
answer is yes?
A: Obviously, yes.

Q: Why do you say "obviously"?
A: Because they weren't there when I came back from Chicago and was at 
the police station, and since I didn't leave town from that point until 
Wednesday when they took pictures of it, I obviously, you know, got it after 
I came back from Chicago.

Q: Tell me where you got the cut and how you got the cut above the joint on 
the middle finger that I'm pointing to on Exhibit 30 which is right below, 
you know, the fingernail.
A: I don't know.

Q: When you got that cut, did you notice you were bleeding at that location?
A: When my finger--my finger bled alot over the next few days as I was
changing dressings and things.

Q: You were changing dressings for the lower cut, on the joint. Correct?
A: Yes, but if you see pictures of the dressing, it was a complete dressing.
MR. BREWER: This isn't very clear. Can you designate which finger
you're talking about? When you are talking about a finger, where on the
finger you're talking about when you are changing the dressings? We have
multiple fingers that are cut--
MR. BAKER: This is good. I like this cross stuff here.
MR. BREWER: Just be clear.

MR. PETROCELLI: We're talking about the middle finger of the left
hand as depicted on Exhibit 30 and Exhibit 31.  And the wound that was 
dressed by Nurse Peratis was the one above the joint, the lower of the two. 
Correct?
A: Correct.

Q:  By the way, when that-- how long was that dressing on?
A: Which one?

Q: The one Peratis put on.
A: I don't know.

Q: Was it a Band-Aid?
A: Yeah, it was a big bandage.

Q: And did it also cover the--
MR. BAKER: Just a minute. You said "Band-Aid," he said yes, "big 
bandage." I don't know what that means.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: What does it mean?
A: It was big. It was not just a normal Band-Aid. It was something that was
big. He actually wanted to splint it for some reason, and I wouldn't let him.

Q: Why not?
A: Because I didn't want it.

Q: Why not?
A: Because I didn't want it splinted.

Q: Did you want it to be cared for properly?
A: I didn't want it splinted. He dressed it, he cleaned it, and he put a bandage 
on it. I didn't want a splint on it.

Q: Did that bandage cover this upper part of your finger where we're seeing 
the second cut on Exhibit 30?
A: I don't recall.

Q: Now, did you change that dressing a few times yourself?
A: Once myself.

Q: Did anybody else change it for you?
A: Yes.

Q: Who?
A: Dr. Huizenga.

Q: Who else?
A: I believe--I believe either Dr. Lee or Dr. Baden Friday, but that could 
have been Huizenga again.

Q:  Now, when they--when you changed the dressing the first and only time, 
did you notice that there was a cut above the initial cut that was
dressed?
A: No.

Q: When Huizenga changed the dressing, did he mention it to you,
that cut?
A: He didn't mention it to me, but he was working on the hand at that
point.

Q:  Did you see that cut, the top cut on the middle finger of Exhibit 30?
A: I don't recall.

Q:  When Baden looked at your fingers on the 17th, did he notice that
upper cut on exhibits 30 or 31 on your middle finger?
A: When he did it when?

Q: 17th of June.
A: I'm sure he did.

Q: Did he mention it to you?
A: I don't recall.

Q: Did you see it?
A: I wasn't really paying attention to those guys.

Q: I will ask you again: How did you cut that--your finger on the upper
part?
A: I don't know.

Q: You have no idea?
A: No.

Q: Do you remember bleeding from that part of your finger as opposed
from the other cut on the finger?
A: I remember my hand bleeding, but not particularly where. I know
the big knuckle was bleeding at one point, but I can't tell you what else
as far as that finger's concerned. 

Q: Now, we have been told that that's a joint. Are you referring to the
joint or the knuckle now? What are you referring to?
A: Referring to the finger.

Q: When you said you were bleeding from the knuckle, what did you mean? 
This joint here where I'm pointing (Indicating)?
A: Yes.

Q: That's the one that was dressed. Right?
A: Yes.

MR. BAKER: Knuckle sandwich is here. It's the interphalangeal joint.
MR.PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker, I'm told, knows about the anatomy, so--
MR. LEONARD: Dr. Baker?
MR. PETROCELLI:--maybe he can help us out.
MR. KELLY: He knew about your bladder, Dan.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q: Now, you're telling us that no discussion of this upper cut on the
middle finger came up with Nurse Peratis, Detectives Vannatter and Lange,
even though they all examined your hand. Is that correct?
A: Correct.

Q: And you're positive it wasn't there at that time. Correct?
A: I didn't see it there at that time.

Q: So you're not positive. Right?
A: Well, I was didn't see it, and I was looking at my hand just like they
were.

Q: And you didn't see that one?
A: Yes.

Q: And are you positive that the cut wasn't there when Huizenga examined 
you on the 15th?
A: I'm not positive about that, no.

Q: Are you positive it wasn't there when Baden examined you on the
17th?
A:  No, I'm not positive about that.

Q: When did you receive that cut, top cut to your middle finger?
A: I don't know.

Q: Give me your best recollection.
A: I don't have a recollection of it.

Q: Zero?
A: Zero.

Q: What's your best recollection of how you cut it?
MR. BAKER: That's the fifth time. Don't answer that.
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, it's an important question.
MR. BAKER: I know it's cross-examination, but I think four is enough.
MR. PETROCELLI: The rule of four, Mr. Baker?
MR. BAKER: Well, I don't know, but I think the rule is one or two, but I'm 
trying to give you as much leeway as I can, sure.
MR. PETROCELLI: I appreciate it. It's important.

Q: I am going to show you Exhibit 32 and let other counsel view it, and I am 
going to point to what you yourself indicated appeared to be some scabbing  
below the fingers.  Do you see that?
A: Yes.

Q: Now, when you were examined by Peratis and with Vannatter and Lange, 
did you have a cut or a mark or abrasion there where that scabbing is on 
Exhibit 32?
A: Did not see it at all.

Q: And what about when you -- with Huizenga on the 15th, did you see it 
then?
A: I don't recall seeing it, but I wasn't looking then.

Q: And on the 17th, did you see it then?
A: I wasn't paying attention on the 17th.

Q: When Baden looked at it.
A: I wasn't paying any attention on the 17th.

Q: How did you get that marking there on your hand?
A: I don't know.

Q:  No recollection?
A: No.

Q: When did you get it?
A: I don't know.

Q:  No recollection?
A: No.

Q:  And did you bleed from that part of your hand during the week of the
13th. June 13th?
A: I don't recall bleeding from that part of my hand, no . I don't think that
would bleed, anyway.

Q: I am going to show you exhibit 33, and it shows a little marking or
scabbing on the thumb. Do you see that?
A: Yes.

Q: On the side of the thumb there?
A: Yes.

Q: Now, was that mark on your hand on June 13 when Nurse Peratis and
Detectives Vannatter and Lange met with you?
A: Did not see it, no.

Q:  On the 15th when Huizenga looked at it?
A: Obviously.

Q: It was there?
A: I say obviously it was.

Q:  Why?
A: Aren't these his pictures?

Q: I believe these--I don't want to make any representations to you. I don't 
know when they are. I really don't, anyway. Don't say "obviously" based 
on some ruler there. Just give me your best recollection.
A: I don't know.

Q: You don't know.
A: No.

Q: And was this mark on your finger on the 17th--
A: No.

Q: --when you were with Baden?
A: I don't know.

Q:  How did you get that mark on your thumb?
A: I don't know.

Q: No idea?
A: No.

Q: When did you get it?
A: I don't know.

Q: No idea?
A: No.

Q: On Exhibit 35 there is a wound on the side of your finger. Do you see
that? 
A: Yes.
MR. BAKER: Lateral aspect.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Lateral aspect, according to your lawyer. How did you get that?
A: I don't know.

Q: When did you get it?
A: I don't know.

Q: Was that wound on your finger when Nurse Peratis examined you in
the presence of Vannatter and Lange?
A: Definitely not.

Q: And you didn't see it then. Right?
A: And I looked, and I didn't see it then.

Q: That's the ring finger, you said?
A: Yes.

Q: Why did you look?
A: Because it was my ring finger and because it was so obvious to this
finger, and Peratis was moving my finger around to get the wrap on and to
do it, and there was nothing there.

Q: Was it there when Huizenga looked at it on the 15th?
A: I believe so.

Q: And you got it somewhere between the 13th and the 15th?
A: Yes.

Q: Q: First of all, what did you say, if anything, about that wound on the 
15th?
A: I don't think anything.

Q: Did he say anything to you?
A: I don't think so.

Q: When did you get that wound?
MR. BAKER: Other than what he has just testified to?
MR. PETROCELLI: He said between the 13th and the 15th.

Q: Yes, specifically.
A: I don't know specifically.

Q:  How did you get it?
A: I don't know.

Q: No idea?
A: No.

Q:  On any of these wounds and cuts, markings, abrasions, do you recall
feeling pain whenever they occurred?
A: No.

Q: On any of them?
A: No.

Q:  Did you dress any of those cuts, wounds or bruises or abrasions the
week of the 13th, starting actually on the -- at the hotel in Chicago, other 
than the one that Peratis and you did subsequently?
A: I'm sorry?

Q: Did you dress any of the wounds
A: Other than the one that Peratis--

Q: Other than the one on your middle finger.
A: No.

Q: Had no other bandages or Band-Aids or dressings.
A: Correct.

Q: During that whole week?
A: Correct.

Q: Were you bleeding quite a bit that week?
MR. BAKER: I don't know what that means.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Well, were you bleeding from these various cuts and wounds and
markings that I've just showed you?
A: Obviously, yes.

Q: And when you were bleeding, what did you do to arrest the bleeding?
A: Well, I got a Band-Aid from the girl at the hotel.

Q: Initially. Correct?
A: Yes. And Peratis changed that.

Q: Right.
A: I changed it one day.

Q: Correct.
A: Then Huizenga changed it, and I don't think it bled after that.

Q: And what about the other cuts that I  showed you, did you bleed
from those cuts? 
A: I don't recall.

Q: During that week were you bleeding and dropping blood on the
ground or on surfaces?
A: Yes.

Q:  Do you know where the blood was coming from?
A: Yes.

Q: Where?
A: My middle finger.

Q: That was dressed?
A: Well, before it was dressed, yes.

Q: Before it was dressed.
A: Yes.

Q: But after it was dressed were you bleeding at all outside of the dressing?
A: After it was dressed the first time, it bled, yes.

Q: And were you dripping blood?
A: I don't know.

Q: What I am trying to find out is if you were dripping blood from any
place that week other than that one wound or cut--
A: Not that I know.

Q:--that was dressed.
A: Not that I know.

Q: Have you ever had a situation before, Mr. Simpson, where you had a
number of cuts on your hand and did not know how you got them?
A: Yes.

Q: That happens frequently to you?
A: In my life, yes.

Q:  Did it happen frequently within the previous six months to June 12?
A: I wouldn't know.

Q:  Well, did you ever notice your hand having a bunch of cuts on it that
you didn't know where they came from within the six months--
MR. BAKER: I don't know what a "bunch of cuts" is.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Several or more.
MR. BAKER: "Several," is that two or three or more?
MR. PETROCELLI: Three or more.
MR. BAKER: All right.
THE WITNESS: As you pointed out, have I ever had it and not noticed it,
and my answer was yes. So I've had it and not noticed it. I've seen scabs on 
my hand, and I don't ever remember bleeding or where the scabs came
from, yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Have you ever seen cuts of the type that  you saw in the photographs
on your hand and not known how you got them>
MR. BAKER: Well, which ones?
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Take that one on the side of the finger that looked pretty deep to me.
A: Yes.

Q: That happened to you before?
MR.  BAKER: Well, the one on the side of the finger without your 
characterization.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: The lateral--
MR. BAKER: The lateral aspect of the third digit.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Yes, Exhibit 35. Did you ever have a cut like that on the side of your -- 
on any part of your hands or fingers and not know where it came from?
A: Yes.

Q: Happened often to you?
A: I can't say "often," but I've had cuts and things and I don't know
where it came from, yes.

Q: I'm not talking about football days. I'm talking about June -- January to 
June of 1994.
A: I don't recall.

Q:  Now, when you played golf on the morning of the 12th and you
drove over to the golf course in what car?

A: On the 12th, the Bentley. I mean the Bronco. These B's.

Q: Bronco?
A: Yes.

Q: Where was the Bronco parked on the evening of the llth?
A: I believe on Ashford.

Q: Right before the mailbox?
A: Maybe across the street, but it could be either the mailbox or across
the street from the mailbox.

Q:  You typically parked the Bronco on Ashford. Correct?
A: More than not, yes.

Q: If you didn't park it on Ashford you parked it in the driveway?
A: I parked it on Rockingham or--I rarely parked it in my driveway, even
though sometimes it was left inside the property, yes.

Q:  Generally on Ashford. Correct?
A: Generally, yes.

Q: I am referring to the time frame of June 1994. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: Now, was your--and your car was parked there when you went to play 
golf. Right?
A: Yes.

Q:  And the clubs were already in the car?
A: No.

Q: Where were they?
A: At the club.

Q: So you just got in your car and drove over there?
A: Yes.

Q: And you didn't have to take any equipment: Golf clubs, gloves or shoes
or anything. Right?
A: Right.

Q:  Did you take anything with you?
A: I don't recall. I don't think so.

Q:  What about your cell phone?
A: Yes, I always -- I don't know. Maybe I  did, yes.

Q: Was it in your car?
A: I probably put it in my car, yes.

Q:  From the night before?
A: Yes.

Q: You take it in every night?
A: No.

Q: You drove home the previous night in the Bentley. Right?
A: Yes.

Q:  On the way to the Bronco, how long did it take you to get to the
Riviera Country Club from your house?
A: Four or five minutes.

Q:  And did you make any phone calls?
A: No.

Q: Did you receive any phone calls?
A: No.

Q: What time did you arrive at the golf course?
A: About 6:15. Roughly.

Q: When you got there, what did you do?
A: Probably ate with the fellows.
MR. BAKER: I don't want you to do  "probably," and he doesn't either. If 
you don't recall, just tell him you don't recall.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  By the way, the fellows are Allen Austin, Craig Baumgartner, Mike
Melchiore and Bob  Hoskins?
A: Possibly.

Q: You had breakfast with those four people?
A: No. I said "possibly," yes.

Q: You don't remember?
A: No.

Q:  Did you have breakfast?
A: Normally I would eat something,  so I'm assuming that I did, so I go to 
the club every day and eat, normally.
 
Q:: What did you eat there that morning?
A: I have no idea.

Q: When did you finish breakfast?
MR. BAKER: Assuming--
THE WITNESS: Assuming I had it, whatever time it was to tee off.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: What time did you tee off?
A: Probably a little before :.

Q: Do you remember talking to anybody between : and : o'clock a.m.?
A: Yeah.

Q: Who?
A: Everybody who was around.

Q:  Did you hit golf balls?
A: I don't know.
 
Q: You retrieved your clubs?
A: Yeah.

Q: Did you make any phone calls in that time period?
A: No.

Q: You teed off at ?
A: I don't know. Maybe a little before :.

Q: Did you make any phone calls while you were playing golf?
A: No.

Q: Did you check your messages at  all?
A:  No.

Q: Did you get a message from Paula Barbieri?
A: No.

Q: Did you receive any message from her before you left?
A: No.
MR. BAKER: Left the home, I assume?
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.
THE WITNESS: No.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: When is the first time that you received a message from her? By
"received," I mean you called in and found a message from her.
MR. BAKER: Retrieved a message from--
MR. PETROCELLI: Retrieved.
THE WITNESS: I don't think I ever did.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Not at all that day?
A: No.
 
Q: You didn't get any phone messages from her that day?
A: I don't believe I ever retrieved any messages from her that day.
 
Q: You had something called a Message Manager, didn't you?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Could you describe how that  worked?
A: You push a button on my phone,  and it go m to my Message Manager.
 
Q: Now, what phone are you referring to?
A: My cell phone.

Q: Just the cell phone?
A: Just the cell phone.

Q: The one that you used interchangeably between the Bronco and
 the Bentley?
A:  Yes.

Q: Now, what button was it that you pressed?
A: I don't recall.
 
Q:  Could you do that from inside the house?
A: Yes.

Q: On the same--on any phone?
A: Yeah.

Q: You could go to any phone and press the button and get your messages. 
Is that right.
A: Yes.
 
Q: Why did you say the cell phone initially?
A: Because it was simpler from the cell phone.

Q: You had it on like speed dial or something?
A: Yeah, I guess so.
 
Q: Is that what you mean when you say "simpler"?
A: Yeah, I think it was just simpler from the cell phone.

Q:  Now, if you wanted to retrieve the messages from any other phone, what 
would you do?
A: I'd call the number.

Q: What was that number?
A: I don't recall.

Q: Same number you have now?
A: Yes.

Q: Okay.
A: No, it's not the same cell phone number I have now, no.
 
Q: Is it the same Message Manager number?
A: I don't have one now.

Q: When did you cancel it?
A: I don't know.

Q:  But you had it in June of . Right?
A: That's correct.

Q: And you had a habit of checking your messages regularly. Correct?
A: Semi-regularly I would say, yeah.
 
Q: Okay. When you checked your messages, you would hear messages
 people left for you?
 A: Yeah.
 
Q: Could you then erase them from the phone?
A: Yeah.

Q: Could you save them?
A: Yeah.

Q:  Did you have your cell phone with you on the golf course?
A: I don't recall if I took it out of the car or not.

Q:  Did you get into an altercation with one of your golfing partners?
A: What is an "altercation"? You have to describe what an altercation is to  
me.

Q:  Did you get into a heated exchange?
A: What does that mean?
MR. BAKER: Verbal exchange?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Verbal heated exchange with one or more members of your golfing 
group.
A: Yes.
 
Q: With whom?
A: Craig Baumgartner.

Q: What did you say to Craig in that heated exchange, and what did he say  
to you?
 A: I can't tell you exactly, but words  to the effect of, " I wasn't moving. 
You shouldn't have teed off until we got here," and a "screw you" from him 
to me and a "screw you" from me to him, and "Don't  be in front of me 
when I teed off," and there was a little profanity.
 
Q: Wait. He was upset with you for moving when he teed off?
A: Yeah, he felt I was moving when  he teed  off, so he was mad and
started yelling something at  me.  

Q:  What tee was that?
A: Second tee.
 
Q:  Second tee?
A: Yes.
 
Q: What did he say to you? Was it  after he hit the shot?
A: After he hit a very bad shot.
 
Q:  Bad shot.
A: Yes.
  
Q:  Did he hit another one?
A: No. I wouldn't let him.
 
Q:  Did he ask you if he could hit  again?
A:  He didn't ask anybody. He said he was going to hit another one. It was 
like, "Screw you, you're not hitting another one," or words to that effect. 
I'm not giving you the exact words be cause I don't recall exact words, but 
that was essentially it.
 
Q: What did he then say to you?
A: I don't know. It was accusing of moving in his shot, you know.
 
Q: You were angry at him?
A: Not at that particular point wasn't,  no.
 
Q: What happened next?
A: Then I hit a bad shot.
 
Q: Did you hit after he hit?
A: Yes.
 
Q:  And then what happened?
A: And then I was pissed at him.
 
Q: Why?
A: Because I hit a bad shot, and Craig is a  guy who tends to get in 
arguments on the golf course,  and it was a beautiful morning, and I had just 
parred the first hole and I was up on all my bets, and I was
pissed off that I hit a bad shot.
 
Q: And what did you say to him.
A: "You're always doing this shit," and--words to that effect, and, you
know, "screw you" and words to that effect.
 
Q:  Did you come to blows?
A: No. No. This is -- among our group, there's arguments regularly.
 
Q:  Did you tell him that you were going to kick his white ass all over  the 
golf course?
A: I might have told him I'd kick his ass if ! he did it again, but not his  
"white ass all over the  golf course." No, I don't think those are words that I 
used.
 
Q: Were you ever physically able to carry  that out?
A: I don't know.

Q: Is he a big guy?
A: Well, I never really expected to fight  him. I haven't been in a fight in my 
adult life except once on a football field, so that was -- I  never expected I 
would have to fight a friend, no.
 
Q: If he hit you, were you prepared to fight  him?
MR. BAKER: Well, don't answer that. This
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI
Q: Were you prepared to fight him?
A: No.
 
Q: Were you physically able to fight him.
MR. BAKER: Well, that calls for speculation on the part of this witness, and 
I am not going to let him answer that question.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Were you physically able to defend yourself if he fought you?
MR. BAKER: That calls for speculation, too.
MR. PETROCELLI: How does it call for speculation?
MR. BAKER: You don't know if the guy is going to pop him right in the
snot locker and knock him out, then you're not able to defend yourself. That 
is so vague and so irrelevant--

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Were you physically fit enough to be able to carry on a fight with this 
guy? Yes or no?
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that.
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: What did you shoot that day?
A: I don't know.
 
Q: Did you make up with him?
A: Yes.

Q: When?
A: By the next hole.

Q: You were angry for about one hole?
A: I wasn't even angry the whole hole.
MR. BAKER: Can I ask him a question? I want to know if Baumgartner 
moved while you teed off.
THE WITNESS: Yes.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You said before, you got angrier at a later point when you made a bad 
shot.
A: Yes.
 
Q: You were angry at him then. Right?
A: Yes. But the anger was my shot, which was later than the argument we 
were having. Then I shot, and that was later. When I say "later," a few  
minutes later.
 
Q:  Same hole. Right?
A : Same hole, yes.
 
Q:  Did you have any more disagreements with  your golfing group that day?
A: No.
 
Q:  What time did you finish playing golf?
A:  11:00 or so.
 
Q: What did you do then?
A: Ate lunch.
 
Q: With the same people?
A: Yeah.

Q: And what did you talk about over lunch?
A: Who knows.
 
Q:  Did you talk about Nicole?
A: No.

Q: Did you talk about her during the golfing game?
A: No.
 
Q:  Did you talk about Paula Barbieri during  the golf or lunch?
A: No.

Q:  Did you have a card game?
A: Yes.

Q:  After lunch?
A: Yes.
 
Q:  Did you talk about Nicole during the card  game?
A: No.
 
Q: Or about Paula?
A: I don't believe so.

Q: What did you have for lunch?
A: I don't know.

Q: What time did you -- Did you play for money when you played poker?
A: Yeah.

Q:  I don't know if you played poker. What l did you play?
A: Cards.

Q: What game?
A: Gin.

Q:  Did you play for money?
A: Yes.

Q:  Did you win?
A: Yes.

Q: How much?
A: I don't know.

Q: Were you able --  Did you deal the cards from time to time?
A: I was having trouble dealing that day.

Q: Were you able to shuffle the cards?
A: I was -- I could deal the cards. I was having trouble shuffling the
cards. I'm sorry.

Q:  Did you not shuffle them, as a result?
A: I tried to a couple of times, and then I  think Allen Austin did a couple of 
times.

Q: Shuffled for you?
A: Yes.

Q: But you dealt all the times. Right?
A: I believe so, yes.

Q: Who is Mesko?
A: I don't know.

Q: Caddy?
A: I don't know.

Q: Who was your caddy?
A: I can't walk on a golf course because of  my knees, so I never take a  
caddy.

Q: You drive?
A: Yes.

Q: And you don't use a caddy?
A: No.
  
Q: Were you in a good mood that day?
A: Great mood.

Q: The whole time?
A: I was tired. but I was in a good mood the whole time other than that -- 
you know, the first two  shots on the second hole.

Q: Did you make any phone calls during that l round of golf?
A: No.

Q: And during the luncheon did you make any phone calls?
A: No.

Q: And during the gin rummy game, did you--
A I may have, but I m not sure.

Q: What time did you leave there?
A: Around 1 o'clock, I believe.

Q: Did you take your clubs with you?
A: Yes.

Q: Were they taken to the car for you?
A: No.

Q: You hand-carried them yourself. Right?
A: Yes.

Q:  Did you have any trouble playing golf that day?
MR. BAKER: I don't know what you mean by  "trouble."
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Physical difficulty swinging a golf club,  playing the game.
A: You have to see my game and how I swing.  Most people would say I do, 
but it's the way I play. It's the only way I can play because of my knees.
 
Q: You look a little awkward, you mean?
A: Yeah. I can't finish on my left side. There's a lot of things I can't do. So 
--
MR. BAKER: His swing has been described as an octopus falling out of a 
tree.
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Is that true?
A: Yeah, I have a horrible swing.

Q: And it wasn't any different on this occasion. Correct?
A: I would say a little . Not only this occasion, but sadly when I play, when 
I travel a lot and play, you know, my body bothers me a little more,  and I  
was being-- evident that I couldn't shuffle the  cards, my body was 
bothering me a little more these  two days.
 
Q: It wasn't hurting enough to prevent you from playing, though. Right?
A: There's very little that can keep me from  playing.
 
Q: Or from going to Chicago to play the next morning. Correct?
A: Very little can keep me from playing golf.
 
Q: Have you ever felt pain before such that you didn't play, canceled
 rounds and chose not to  play?
A: Well, I stopped in the game, yes.
 
Q: Stopped playing?
A: Yes.
 
Q: That didn't happen on the 11th or 12th. Correct?
A: No. No.
 
Q: Let me show you some phone records. These were introduced as a -- 
What's the exhibit number, Peter? Do you know? These were subpoenaed in 
the criminal  case, and they are for your cell phone. 613-3232, area code 
310.
A: That could be it, yes.
 
Q: Take a look at 6-12.
A: Okay. I'm going to have a little trouble. I should have brought my
glasses.
MR.BAKER: Which one do you want him to look at?
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: The first entry is 7:06 a.m.?
A: Yes.

Q: What does it show there? Call to whom.
A: I don't know.
 
Q: Let me see.
Q: It says number called message--"Location: Message Manager."  Do
you see that?   
A: Yes.

Q:  Then it shows a call at eight minutes. Do you see that?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And you picked up your message at that time?
A: No.

Q:  Do you know what that entry is for?
A: No.
  
Q: No idea?
A: At the time I don't have any idea, but  I'm assuming--no, you told me not 
to assume.

Q: Do you now know what it is?
A: I can only assume now what it is.

Q: Tell me.
A: I'm assuming it's a message from Paula.

Q: That was made to your Message Manager?
A: Yes.

Q: Is that what you're saying?
A: That's what it is.

Q:  That's how it shows up on the bill?
A: Yes.

Q:  How do you know? Tell me what tells you that she called you and you 
didn't pick up -- and that's not an entry reflecting your picking up your 
message?
A: Because there's no number there.

Q: No number where?
A: Here (Indicating).

Q: Okay. When--
MR. KELLY: I am sorry. We can't see where he's pointing.
MR. PETROCELLI: Here (Indicating). I pointed to the--
MR. BAKER: What?
MR.PETROCELLI: You said you can't either?
MR.BAKER: I couldn't see either where he was  pointing. I'm not--
it's not relevant, but it's okay.
MR. PETROCELLI: Do you want to clarify?
MR. BAKER: No.
MR. PETROCELLI: He was pointing to the first  line.
MR. LEONARD: I think these guys want to see it.
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: When did you pick up--
MR. BAKER: Can we take a break? My partner's got to-- 
MR. PETROCELLI: You don't wan to say that on the record, do you?

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the time is
approximately 2:17.
 
(Recess.)
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the time is
approximately 2:40.
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 39 was marked for identification by the reporter and is 
attached hereto.)
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Mr. Simpson, I showed you the phone bill, which we are going to
mark as the next exhibit in order, and I will have some copies made at the 
break. Okay?
A: Uh-huh.
 
Q: I guess that's Exhibit 39. I will tell you, though, that there is some red 
handwritten notations on this copy which you should just disregard because 
they were made by my office. Okay? I'm trying to understand the way your 
phone system worked here. Do you see in this column with the abbreviation 
"FEAT," feature, I guess, there + is a "CF" there?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Do you know what that feature is? 
A: I think it's call forwarding.

Q: What does that mean?
A: I believe that means the call that's coming in is forwarded to my message 
center.

Q: A call that would be made to your cell phone?
A: Yes.

Q:  And there is no answer, so it goes to a message center. Is that right?
A: I believe so, yes.
 
Q:  Does this--does your cell phone bill pick up when you call your message 
center from your cell phone to check your messages?
A: I don't recall. If it did, you would see the phone, I think, on the phone 
thing here.

Q: What number would we see?
A: Whatever number that was dialed, I  believe. I'm just guessing at
this point.
 
Q: If you were going to pick up your messages by calling your Message 
Manager, what number would appear in that column, if you made the call 
from your cell phone?
A: If I had to guess-- no, I can't guess, so I don't know. I don't know.

Q: Would there be a phone number you would dial?
A: You know, I don't pay my phone bills, so I don't know.

Q: But you use -- you dial the phone, though, to get your messages. Right?
A: Yes.
  
Q: And what number did you dial?
A: I believe I dialed my phone number.

Q: To pick up your messages?
A: Yes.

Q:  Your home phone number or your cell number?
A: My cell number.

Q: And if you were at the cell phone, you just hit speed dial, but if you were 
at another phone,  you would just punch in your cell phone number. Is  that 
right?
A: I think I would do just what--I would  do just what anybody else
would call in to do, but  once they called in, then you push a code number,  I  
believe,and then the code puts you into your message  center.

Q:  Now, when did you pick up Miss Barbieri's message left to you at
7:06 a.m.,  eight-minute message?
A: I don't believe I ever did.
 
Q: Not the whole day?
A: I don't believe so, no.
 
Q: You never checked your messages that whole day?
A: You know, I know I was checking, but I l don't believe I ever checked 
my message.

Q: You know you were checking what?
A: My message machine at the house when I was at home, and it just seems 
impossible that I would not have checked my cell phone, to me, but 
obviously,  sitting here looking at this, I didn't.
  
Q: You could have received that message from  a different phone, like
 your home phone. Right?
A: Possibly, yes.
 
Q:  Now, did you have an answering machine on  at home?
A: Yes.
 
Q: : A normal answering machine or a part of this Message Manager system?
A: A normal answering machine.
 
Q: Where you have to click the button and hear your messages. Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q:  Did you have another answering machine besides that one and besides 
this Message Manager system?
A: No.
 
Q: There were only two ways you could pick up your messages. Right.
A: Yes.

Q: Did Miss Barbieri leave you... Excuse me? Okay. Did Miss Barbieri
leave you a message on  your message answering machine in your house?
A: No.

Q: That whole day?
A: No.

Q: Where was that machine then?
A: In my kitchen.

Q: Only one that you used?
A: Yes.
 
Q:  Could you pick up your messages from a remote location?
A: No.

Q: Just in the kitchen. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: Were there any messages for you that entire day on that answering 
machine?
A: Maybe one. I'm not sure. One that I know the machine picked up, 
because I was at home and I didn't pick it up and I heard the message being 
left.

Q: You can hear it while it's being left. Right?
A: That one, yes.
 
Q: Who was the message from?
A: Mike Haynes.

Q: That's the ex-football player?
A: Yes.

Q: What did he say?
A: He wanted to talk to me about going to a  tournament for a company.
  
Q: Did you call him back?
A: No.

Q: That day?
A: No.
 
Q: That's the only message on that machine?
A: That's the only one I recall.
 
Q:  When you came back the next day, on the 13th, back to Rockingham, did 
you pick up your messages--
A: No.

Q: --on that machine?
A: No.

Q:  Did you check them?
A: No.

Q: Do you know if anybody picked them up for you?
A: No.
 
Q:  Now, you called Miss Barbieri several times from your cell phone. 
Correct?
A: I tried to, yes.
 
Q:  She had an L.A. local number, and she also had a 305 area code cell 
phone number. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: The cell phone number was the one she had from the Miami area.
Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And you left her messages on each of those occasions. Correct?
A: I don't think so.

Q: When you called her local 470-3468 number and she wasn't home, did 
she have an answering machine there?
A: Yes.
 
Q: You could leave messages. Right?
A: Yes.
  
Q: When you dialed the cell phone and she didn't answer, that also triggered 
an answering machine. Right?
A: No.
 
Q: You sure of that?
A: Positive.

Q: Did you talk to her at all that day?
A: No.

Q: Let me show you, there is a call from your cell phone to the 305  number 
for the duration of 1 minute 29 seconds. This is Exhibit 39.
Do you see that entry there, the second entry?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Now, were you letting it ring that long?
A: No. I think once it stopped ringing, someone came on and said that the 
cell phone is off and whatever the hell, whatever the hell.

Q: What does that mean?
A: The cell phone is out of the area or it's not on or whatever they --
whatever that--whatever that code is, whatever that is.
 
Q: You mean when you call someone and they're not at their cell
phone?
A: Yeah, or they have it off.
 
Q: There is a minute 29.
A: Well, it obviously rang for a minute and 29 then.

Q: You were pretty anxious to get her, weren't you?
A: No.

Q:  Not at all?
A: Not anxious. If I got her, I would have got her. If I didn't, I didn't.
 
Q:  You called her one, two, three, four,  five, six, seven -- eight times
 from the cell phone. Do you see that, on that day?
A: Yes.
 
Q: You never made contact. Right?
A: Yes.

Q:  And you also called her from your home phone. Right?
A: I believe so. I'm not sure.
 
Q:  How many times from the home phone?
A: I don't know.

Q:  How many messages did you leave her that day?
A: Two. I believe two.
 
Q: What did your messages say?
A: I believe earlier in the day I said I was -- I'd be at the house. "Give me a 
buzz. If you're in town or wherever you are, give me a buzz."
And then late that night, because I hadn't heard from her all day, the
message was--
 
Q:  Message you left?
A: Message I left her was, ''Oh, so what is it? What's going on? What's
happening." Or words to that effect. "But anyway, give me a buzz, you 
know, and I'll be back this week."
 
Q: : Now, when you left that message, you were acknowledging her prior 
message that she was splitting up with you. Right?
A: No,that's not correct.
  
Q: You were at her deposition when I took it. Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q:  And you heard her testify that she gave -- left you a message early in the 
morning saying that she was breaking up with you. Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And you heard her testify that you left several messages that day. Correct?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Did you ever pick up that message of hers?
A: I don't believe so. I don't--I've never heard the message that she
said she was splitting up with me, no.

Q: Never.
A: Never.

Q: So when you left for Chicago that evening, you had no idea that she 
wanted to split up with you. Right?
A: No idea at all.

Q: And as far as you were concerned,  everything was hunky-dory. Right?
A: Not necessarily, no.

Q: But this wasn't any different from the night before. Right?
A: That's a tough question to answer. I'm sorry. I don't know how to 
answer that question.
 
Q: Truthfully.
MR. BAKER: Well, don't-- wait a minute.
THE WITNESS: There is no answer then.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Well, you hadn't had any contact with her. You hadn't had any discord 
with her or disagreement or conflict with her.
A: Uh-huh.
 
Q: You didn't--said you didn't pick up  her message--
A: True.

Q:  Where she wanted to split up with you,  and so far as you knew,
things were the same as they were the
evening before. Correct?
A: As far as I knew, as far as I had any information of, that's correct.

Q: Well, did you have some other basis to  believe things were not correct?
A: Correct.

Q: What was that?
A: She didn't call me.
 
Q: Was she supposed to call you?
A: Not necessarily, but normally if I leave a message for her, she does. 

Q: So you thought maybe she was upset with you?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you consider the possibility that maybe something could have
happened to her?
A: No.

Q: Maybe she was injured or in the hospital or something?
A: No.

Q: Why did you exclude those possibilities?
A: Because I'm a positive person.

Q: Other than that, any reason?
A: No.
 
Q:  Now, even though you had called her a number of times and couldn't get 
through to her, you did not check your messages on your cell phone?
A: Checked it at my house. I may have tried to, but I didn't get through. Just 
like I wasn't getting through to her when I was trying to make these calls.
 
Q: Why didn't you get through?
A: Because when you drive on Sunset, you get through and then it cuts out, 
then you have to redial again.
 
Q: Well, when you got to your house. you +] could have checked your cell 
phone Message Manager. Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And did you do so?
A: I -- it seemed to me that I should have,  but I don't recall doing it, no.
 
Q:  Now, you had said earlier that you were very lovey-dovey and romantic 
the night before.  Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q: So there wasn't any basis for you to think there was a problem. Right?
A: Incorrect.
 
Q: What was the basis?
A: I went to play golf.
 
Q: What did that have to do with anything?
A: You asked me if that's a basis. I went to play golf. I think she told you in 
her deposition what that had to do with everything.
 
Q: Yeah, but you didn't know what her deposition was going to be on the 
morning of June 12.
MR.BAKER: Don't answer that. That's argumentative.
MR. PETROCELLI: Responding to his statement.
 
Q: That's a fact. Correct? 
MR. BAKER: Well, I think that it's a self-evident truth that he didn't
know what she was  going to testify to. He knew her attitude, but he  didn't 
know what she was going to testify to.
BY MR. PETROCELLI
Q: Are you saying that just because you were  going to play golf, that you 
knew she would be upset with you?
A: I suspected, when she didn't call me, that she was upset that I went to 
play golf, yes.
 
Q: But you didn't discuss it the night before?
A: Not at all.
 
Q: And she didn't show any upset towards you. Right?
A: No.

Q: And you play golf virtually every Saturday and Sunday. Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: And Paula was fully aware of that.  Right?
A: Yes.

Q: Is there anything else on the basis of which you might have suspected that 
she was upset with you other than the fact that you went to play golf?
A: I don't quite understand how you--
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Leonard, there is no point  in your having to
suggest answers to the witness.
MR. LEONARD: I'm not suggesting answers.
THE WITNESS: I didn't hear him. I didn't understand your question totally.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You said you suspected she might be upset with you because you went  to 
play golf that morning.
A: Yes.
 
Q: And is there anything else that caused  you to suspect that she might  be 
upset with you?
A: No.

Q: When was the next time you spoke to Paula after you saw her on
Saturday night?
A: I believe -- I believe Monday night.

Q:  How did you speak to her?
A: I think she was with my friends, some friends of mine, and they called 
me and she was there with them.

Q: Where?
A: They were in Vegas.
 
Q: Who were the friends?
A: Mark Packer.

Q: Where does he live? In New York?
A: Yes.

Q: Who else?
A: I don't know who else.

Q: His wife, Suzanne?
A: I don't -- unless Mark's got married and  I wasn't invited. I don't he'd 
ever get married l again.

Q: Who else besides Mark Packer?
A: Just Mark.

Q: And they called you together, Paula and Mark?
A: I believe Paula was with Mark when I first spoke to Paula again, yes.
 
Q: In this conversation was there any discussion about her breaking up  with 
you?
A: No.

Q: Or the message she left you?
A:  No.

Q: What did you discuss? What was happening to you?
A: I don't think anything was happening to me.What I was feeling, maybe, 
and Paula--what I was feeling. Paula wanted to know if I wanted her there.
 
Q: And what did you say?
A: Not right away, no.

Q: Why did you say that?
A: Because I needed to spend time with my kids.
 
Q:  You didn't see your kids until Wednesday. Right?
A: No, that's wrong..

Q: Tuesday night?
A: The next day.

Q: Tuesday. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: In the evening. Right?
A: No. It was about midday, I would imagine.
 
Q:  You called--Let me ask you this: You called Nicole on June 12 also. 
Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q: How many times?
A: Once, I believe.

Q: Are you unsure?
A: No, I'm not unsure.

Q: Are you positive?
A: Pretty positive, yes.
 
Q:  Called her only one time?
A: Yes.
 
Q: What time?
A: I don't know. I was in my car, though.
 
Q: How do you know that.
A: Because--I was in my car because one of the purposes of calling
her was when I did get Paula, I was going to pick up Justin, and I needed to 
talk about the tickets, and I thought
maybe Justin would come and hang with me because she would be, you 
know -- the kids, the girls are getting dressed, you  know, prettied up for  
the dance recital.
 
Q: And did you get through to her?
A: Yes.
 
Q: What car were you in?
A: The Bronco.
 
Q: What is your best estimate as to the time?
A: I don't know, but I'm sure it's on the phone thing there.

Q:  What's your best estimate?
A: I'm sure it's on the phone thing. I don't know.

Q: You have no recollection without looking at the phone records?
A: After 1:00 o'clock, I would think.
  
Q: After 1:00?
A: Yes.

Q: And before when?
A: Before 5:00.

Q: Is that the best you can do without the  phone records?
A: Yes.

Q:  Where were you going?
A: I was on my way to Paula's, and when I didn't get her, I just turned on 
Barrington and called Nicole.

Q: Where were you coming from?
A: Golf course.
 
Q: So this was right after you left Riviera Country Club?
A: Yes.Yes.
 
Q: You headed over to Paula's?
A: I was going to--I was trying to call Paula. If she would have been
home, I would have gone  to her  house, but since I couldn't get through, I  
called Nicole.
 
Q: Wilshire and what? It's where Paula lives.
A: Wilshire and whatever. I don't know.
 
Q: In Westwood?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Is it east or west of the 405?
A: East.

Q: How far had you gotten to Paula's from Riviera?
A: Right about to Barrington.
 
Q: Barrington and what?
A: Sunset.
 
Q: Sunset?
 A: Yes.

Q: And then she's not home,and you called Nicole?
A: Yeah.
 
Q: And she was home?
A: Yeah.
 
Q: She answered the phone?
A: Yeah. I don't know. I don't know if she answered the phone or not.
 
Q: Did anybody else answer the  phone?
A: I don't recall.
 
Q: And relate that discussion, what you said and what she said.
A: I can only be in general. I can't be specific, but I know it was basically 
about the tickets. She was -- either-- whoever -- someone was  on the phone 
at the time. Then when she came on, it  was about the tickets and what time 
they'd be there; and if Justin and Sydney was coming, did I get the other 
tickets-- I mean -- I'm sorry-- if Jason or  Arnelle was coming, did I have the 
other tickets,  what time they'd be there; if Jason or them was going,  could 
they get there early,  because we know it'd be sold out from previous 
experience, and you need to hold seats, and if--what was Justin doing. He 
could come hang out with me till the time. But I think he either was playing 
with his cousin or waiting for his cousin. And that was it.
 
Q: Cousin was at the house there?
A: I'm not sure. Either he was waiting for  his cousin or his cousin was 
there.

Q: Who is his cousin?
A: Either Sean or Aaron.

Q: The son of whom.
A: Denise Armeni.

Q: Denise's son is Sean?
A: Yes.

Q: And Aaron is?
A: Aaron is Dominique's son.

Q: What did you call Dominique initially?
A: Minnie.
 
Q: Minnie?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Describe the tone that Nicole displayed.
A: Normal tone. Normal tone.
 
Q: Friendly conversation?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you have a disagreement?
A: No.

Q:  Any conflict?
A: Rarely with the kids. No.

Q: With Nicole, I mean.
A: No. Rarely about the kids. I'm sorry.

Q: Did she say she would save a seat for you?
A: We were discussing who would get there first, so I don't think  saving a 
seat with me came up because I might have got there before then. So  
whoever got there first would try to save seats.
 
Q: Did you tell her you were going alone?
A: No.
 
Q: How many seats would she know to save for you? Did you tell her that?
A: No, but she just saved me one, as far as I know.

Q: If you got there first, how many seats would you save?
A: I think I pretty much told her I'd have a tough time saving seats because 
I'd be alone. It's tough to hold seats if you're alone.
 
Q: You knew her whole family was coming?
A: At that point, yes.

Q: How long did that call last?
A: I don't know.

Q: And were you cordial when you spoke?
A: Very much so.

Q: Did she ask you if Paula was coming?
A: She never, ever, ever asked me anything about Paula.
 
Q: And you didn't bring it up. Right?
A: No.

Q: Did you tell her that you wanted a seat next to the family?
A: No.
 
Q: Did that come up at all?
A: Not at all.

Q:  Did the location of your seat come up at all?
A: No.
 
Q: How were you--Did you discuss with her how you were to receive the 
tickets if she was already  there before you and sitting down?
A: No.We said we'd get there at 5:00, so I guess we just assumed we'd meet 
there at 5:00.

Q:  Did you have to pay for the tickets?
A: I don't know. If she sent the bill to the office, I don't know.

Q:  Did she discuss with you where Sydney was on the program?
A: No.
 
Q:  Did you have a discussion how long you would be there?
A: No. I think I might have asked.

Q: What did she say?
A: She didn't know.

Q:  Did you discuss what would happen after the recital?
A: No.

Q:  Did she say that she was going out for dinner with the family?
A: No.

Q:  Did you ask about that subject at all?
A:  Not at all.

Q: Did you discuss making plans to go out afterwards?
A: No.

Q:  Did you tell her what your plans were afterwards?
A: No.

Q:  Did you tell her that you were going to Chicago?
A: No.

Q: Did you say anything else to her that you can remember?
A: No.

Q: And did she to you that you can remember?
A: No.

Q: I will show you this phone record. It's again Exhibit 39. Can you
find the call that you made from your cell phone?
A: Which call?
 
Q: To Nicole that we just talked about.
A: Is this -- what's her number?  Because all of these calls I think is her 
phone number.
 
Q: What was her phone number?
A: I don't recall, but I think this 829 may have been her phone number. 
Brentwood is the only number-- 829-5636. I think that may have been her 
phone number. I may be wrong there, but I think that must be her phone 
number.

Q: You have trouble seeing close up?
A: Sometimes, yeah.

Q: You wear glasses?
A: I don't wear them. I read with them now  since I've been in jail, yes. 

Q: Did you wear glasses at all in 1994?
A: No.

Q: Or contacts?
A: I'm sorry. I may be looking at the wrong place here.

Q: Or contacts?
A : No.  I think I'm looking at the wrong place over here.You've got to tell 
me what her number is. Is that 829 her phone number?
 
Q: No
A: Okay.

Q: How about this one, 826-0403? Does it sound about right?
A: That could be. That could be it, yes.
MR. LEONARD: Is this marked?
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. .
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: And the time is what, Mr. Simpson? Can you tell there? 3:09?
A: I got to look--
MR. BAKER: That's the duration.
MR. PETROCELLI: What is the time there,  Mr. Baker?
MR. BAKER: It's sometime around 2:00. I can't  tell you exactly.
MR. PETROCELLI: It's military time. Right?
MR. BAKER: Yeah. It's 2:18.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  About 2:18? You see that?
A: I don't see it. Show me.
MR. BAKER: This is the third number down, and the third number
down here "14:18:48," which is 2:18:48--
 
MR. PETROCELLI: P.M.
MR. BAKER: P.M.
THE WITNESS: That could be it.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Is that about right?
A: That's about right.

Q:  Only call you made to Nicole that day. Correct?
A: Yes.
 
You said you left the golf course at about 1:00 and this is at 2-- What did you 
say, Mr. Baker?
MR. BAKER: 2:18.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: 2:18. What did you do in that intervening hour and 18 minutes?
A: I think you're wrong. I said I left after 1:00. I wasn't sure. It could have 
been 1:00. l All the guys were there. So it would have been about that time 
that I left.
 
Q: What am I wrong about?
A: That I don't believe I left -- said that I left exactly at 1:00 o'clock. I know 
it was after  12:00, after 1:00, sometime.
 
Q: When did you leave?
A: After 12:00 or after 1:00.

Q: What's the best you can estimate?
A: That's the best I can estimate.

Q:  Well, if you called at 2:18, do you think you left shortly before then?
A: Yes.

Q: You didn't go anywhere in between?
A: No.

Q: After you made that call, what did you do?
A: Went home.

Q:  To Rockingham?
A: Yes.

Q: In your Bronco?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you stop anywhere?
A: No.

Q: Where did you park?
A: On... On Ashford, I believe, yes.

Q:  And did you take anything into the house  with you?
A: At that time, no.

Q:  Okay. You went into the home?
A: Yes.

Q: Was the security system on?
A: I would believe so. I don't--I'm not sure if I remembered in the morning, 
but I would believe so.

Q: When you got in, did you check your messages to see if she had called 
you back?
A: I believe I looked at the machine to see if there was any messages.
 
Q: Were there any?
A: I don't recall. I don't think so. Not  from her, there definitely wasn't, but 
I don't think so.
 
Q:  And was anybody home?
A: No.
 
Q: What did you do?
A: I think I turned on the TV, grabbed  a  book and laid on the couch and--
yeah, that's what I did.
 
Q: And you don't remember checking your cell  phone machine. Right?
A: No.
 
Q: For messages.
A: No.
 
Q:  Did you call anybody that afternoon?
A: I don't recall.
 
Q:  How long did you stay on the couch?
A: I don't know. Kato came in, and I talked to him a little bit, and--actually I 
stayed on the l couch right up till a little before 5:00.

Q: From about 2:30 to 5:00?
A: Yeah, because I think I kind of fell asleep a little bit. I was watching--I 
think a basketball game was on, but I'm not totally sure about that at this 
point in time.
 
Q: Now, how did Kato get in the  house?
A: I saw him in the front yard, and I have a -- right by my couch is a door, 
and he was there, stretching, I believe.
 
Q: By the "front yard," you mean that area where your Bentley was parked?
A: Yes.
 
Q:--and the garage door is, that area. Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q: You could see out to that area from your family room?
A: No. From my kitchen.
 
Q: Is that where you were lying down?
A: Yes.
 
Q: In the kitchen?
A: Yes.

Q: And what did you do when you saw Kato?
A: Said "Hey" and started talking to him.
 
Q: Did you go outside first?
A: No. I think he walked in.
 
Q: The door was open?
A: It was probably unlocked, yes.
 
Q:  Which door was that?
A: The door that goes into my kitchen
 
Q: And he came in, and what did you guys do?
A: Talked.

Q: In the kitchen?
A: Yeah.

Q: What did you talk about?
A: Maybe a little basketball and girls.

Q: What about girls?
A: Just girls.

Q: Your girls?
A: I didn't have girls.

Q: What did you have?
A: A girlfriend.

Q:  Paula?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you talk about Paula?
A: I believe so.
 
Q: And what did you talk about?
A: I think he asked me where was Paula.

Q: What did you say?
A: I didn't know.

Q: Was that the end of it?
A: I don't know totally, but I'm sure we talked about it a little more.

Q: What did you talk about Paula?
A: I think he was asking me where she was,  and I told him, "I don't know. 
She's either out of town or she's hiding from me."

Q:  Did you tell Kaelin that she was upset with you?
A: I may have, that I thought maybe she was. I didn't say she was upset 
with me, but she's probably pissed or something.

Q: Did you give him the reason why?
A: I don't think so, but I may have.

Q:  Did you say because you played golf?
A: I know that was part of it.

Q:  You told him that?
A: I believe so, but I'm not a hundred percent sure on that.

Q: Is that all you did--is that all you talked about concerning Paula?
A: Some other girls.

Q: What other girls?
A: There was a girl he thought I should meet.

Q: What is her name?
A: I don't know.

Q: Tracy?
A: Maybe.

Q: What did he say about her?
A: That she was a smart business girl and she was starting in business, and 
he had told her I should meet her and, "You really should talk to her She's" 
-- you know Kato. It was a pitch, I guess, and she was not like all the other 
Playboy girls, and she was
smart and, "You two would really like talking to each other."

Q: She was a Playboy girl?
A: I guess so, Playmate.
 
Q:  Did you ask what she looked like?
A: Yes.

Q:  Did you ask her to go get -- did you ask Kaelin to get a picture of her?
A: I may have.

Q: And did he do so?
A: I don't recall.

Q:  Did he show you a picture of this woman that day?
A: I don't recall.
 
Q: Is her name Tracy Adele, A-d-e-l-e?
A: I don't recall.

Q: Did you call this person, Tracy?
A: He did.

Q:  He called her from where?
A: Somewhere in my house, I think.

Q: Where did Tracy live then?
A: In L.A., I believe.

Q: And did you speak to Tracy?
A: Well, she was wasn't home, and I think he  left-- I know he left a 
message to call me--or to call the house.

Q:  Did you talk on her machine?
A: No.

Q: What was the message that he left Tracy?
A: I don't know.

Q: It was in your presence. Right?
A: I don't think so. It may have been, but I wasn't paying attention to what 
he was saying to her on the machine.
 
Q: From your hotel room-- from your house  he made that call. Right?
A: Yes.

Q:  Do you remember whether he went out to get a magazine and came back 
to show it to you?
A: He may have.

Q: Where did he get it?
A: I didn't go. I was on the couch.

Q: Did he go to a store and come back?
A: I don't know.

Q: What happened after you spoke to Kaelin
A: He left, and I watched or napped or read  or whatever I was doing.
 
Q: Do you know anyone in Bowie, Maryland?
A: No.
 
Q: Do you know anyone in Maryland?
A: No.
 
Q: Did you make a phone call to Maryland?
A: I made a phone call. I don't know if it  was to Maryland, but I did make  a 
phone call.
 
Q: To whom?
A: I think she called me.

Q: Who is "she"?
A: The girl that he was trying to tell me to talk to.

Q: This Tracy?
A: Yes.

Q: Oh, she did call back. Right?
A: She called and we started to talk, and I  said, "You shouldn't get stuck 
with this phone bill. Give me your number. I'll call you back, so you won't 
have to pay the phone bill." She said, "That's all right." And I said, "No, let 
me do that," and I called her back.

Q: Was that a long-distance call?
A: Yes. 

Q: Where was she calling from?
A: As I just told you, I don't know.

Q: What area code did you dial?
A: I don't remember.

Q: Was it across the country some place?
A: I have no idea where it was.

Q: What time was it?
A: I don't know.
 
Q: What did you and Tracy talk about?
A: Business, what she was talking about, business, things that she was 
trying to do, I believe living in L.A., what it was about, not being in the 
party scene, and essentially that.

Q: Did you make arrangements to see her?
A: No.
 
Q: To talk to her again?
A: I told her if she was in town, to let Kato know and maybe we can -- you  
know, come over and eat or we can have lunch or something.

Q: Had Kato met this woman before?
A: I assume so. I'm not supposed--I assume he did, yes.
 
Q: Why did you say let Kato know instead of let you know?
A: Because she was Kato's friend.

Q:  Did Kato arrange women for you from time to time?
A: He tried--
MR. BAKER: I don't know what you mean by that.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Find dates for you.
A: He never did, but he tried to.

Q: He never did in what sense? You didn't let him?
A: I was never interested.

Q: But you used to talk to them. Right?
A: Yeah.Yeah.

Q:  He never succeeded in finding a successful match. Is that what you're 
saying?
A: No. He never succeeded in getting me to go out with any of the girls that 
he wanted me to go out with.
MR. BAKER: But that's a clever question. I'll give you a gold star for that 
one.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: If you didn't know where this person was calling you from, why were 
you concerned about the phone bill?
A: Because I knew she was out of town, and  it was a long-distance call.   

Q: You knew it was long distance. Right?
A: Yeah.

Q: But you didn't know where?
A: I didn't know where.

Q:  Okay. Was Kaelin there when you made that call?
A: No.

Q:  Now, did you and Kaelin talk about your  ex-wife Nicole?
A: At that time?

Q: Yes.
A: I don't think so.

Q:  No discussion at all about her?
A: I don't think so.

Q:  Did you tell Kaelin you were going to this recital?
A: Yeah.

Q: You made a special trip back to attend this recital. Right?
A: Mainly, yes.

Q: You were in the East. Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And your friend Bender tried to talk you into staying in the East. Right?
A: I wish he had succeeded.
 
Q: Why is that?
A: Because then I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you.
 
Q: What did you tell him when he suggested that you stay in the East?
A: I told him I thought about it. I thought about it; I came close to  staying, 
but I felt I  couldn't miss Sydney's recital, and plus we had a  thing Saturday 
night I could have taken Paula to. So  thinking about it all, it was best just to 
come home to do that.
 
Q: Did you talk to Nicole about that decision?
A: No.

Q: When was the last time before the call you made to Nicole on the 
afternoon of June 12th that you had spoken to her before then?
A: Either Wednesday -- I believe Wednesday night. Could have been
Thursday night, but I'm pretty sure it was Wednesday night.
 
Q: Was that a telephone call?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And when was the last time you spoke to Nicole before she died?
A: Spoke with her?
 
Q: Yes.
A: Like a conversation or something?
 
Q: Yes.
A: 2:00 o'clock that day.  2 whatever,18, whatever you said that was.

Q: Last time you spoke to her?
A: Yeah, have a conversation with her, yes.

Q: Last time you saw her?
A: Was at the recital.

Q: The last time you spoke to her--Did you  have a conversation with her at 
the recital?
A: No. No.
 
Q: Now, did you tell this Tracy or whoever this person was about Nicole?
A: I don't believe so.

Q: And did you tell Kaelin you were going to the recital?
A: Yeah.

Q: And did you talk about meeting up with Nicole there?
A: I don't think so, no.

Q: No discussion at all?
A What do you mean, "meeting up with Nicole?"
 
Q:  The interaction that you would have with Nicole, seeing her there and 
what that would be like?
A: I don't believe so.
 
Q:  Did you fall asleep at all that day?
MR. BAKER: We've been through this.
THE WITNESS: I believe so, yes.
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: How long did you sleep?
A: I don't know.
 
Q: When did you wake up?
A: Right time--right before it was time to go to the recital.
 
Q:  When did Kaelin leave the house?
A: I don't know.
 
Q:  You slept on the couch?
A: Yes.
 
Q:  Got up around 4:45 and dressed. Right?
A: Roughly, yeah. Probably a little later than that, because I felt I was  really 
late.

Q: Because you were sleeping?
A: I think I fell asleep. I mean, as I said, I was reading, I was watching TV 
and I dozed off--I evidently dozed off, yes.
 
Q: When you woke up, though, you immediately saw you were running 
late?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And then showered, changed and went?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And you were no--
A: Not a shower. I'm sorry.
 
Q: Excuse me?
A: I did not shower.
 
Q: You did not shower.
 A: No.
 
Q: You changed and left.
A: Yes.
 
Q: And you drove the Bentley over to the recital?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And what time did you arrive at Paul Revere Junior High School?
A: I think just a little after 5:00.
 
Q:  And when you went into the recital,  had it already begun?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Was it dark?
A: I mean, dark not like a movie theater dark, no, but you can see, you 
know. If I was in the back and they were sitting in the front row and turned 
around, I would be able to see them, yes.

Q: Were they sitting in the front row?
A: No.
 
Q: Where were they sitting?
A: In the back row.

Q:  "They" being whom.
A: The family.

Q:  The Brown family?
A: Yeah, the Brown family and the Fishman  family.
  
Q:  Meaning Ron and Cora?
A: Yes.

Q: Did they have a child there, too?
A: I believe so. One daughter was dancing. I can't remember if the
other kids were there.

Q: Now, when you got to the entrance, how did you get your ticket to enter?
A: I just told the lady I need to--my ticket is inside.
 
Q: And did she let you in?
A: Yes.

Q: Where did you go?
A: I went to the left of the auditorium and started walking down the left aisle, 
and at some point Justin and Aaron ran up and grabbed me. 

Q:  And what did you then do?
A: I followed them back over--back out to the lobby, over to the
right side of the theater and  asked Nicole for my ticket.

Q: They saw you and came to you to tell you that you were going the
wrong way? 
A: Yes.

Q: And they brought you over to the right side?
A: Yes.

Q:  And you went over to Nicole?
A: Yes.

Q:  And asked for your ticket?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you say anything before that?
A: No.

Q: What did you say?
A: "I need the ticket."

Q: And what did she say?
A: "Oh, oh, here."
 
Q: Did she get up?
A: No.
 
Q: She handed it to you?
A: No. I think she handed it to Dominique,  who handed it to me. I was  
there in the--they were in the middle of the row and I was at the end of the 
row, and it was standing room only.
 
Q: Now, when you were at the end of the row,  you were talking across all 
those people to Nicole,  who was in the middle?
A: Actually I was trying to lean behind them and got their attention,
and they just passed the thing over to me.
 
Q: You were standing up. Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Was there a seat saved for you?
A: Yes, but it was on the other side.
 
Q: Other side of what?
A: The row.
 
Q: Of the aisle?
A: Yes.

Q: Was there any members of the family on that side?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Who?
A: Denise,  Lou, Judy.
 
Q: And was there a seat next to them for you?
A: No.
 
Q: Where was your seat?
A: My seat was in the back row, corner seat.
 
Q: How far from the family?
A: Justin was next to me. Justin and Aaron or Sydney, you know, they were 
up and gone. They were sitting in the two seats next to me. Then Nicole was 
seated in the fourth seat in, and Dominique was seated next to her. Then 
directly in front of me was Denise, with Cora Fishman sitting next to her. 
Then directly  in front of them were
Lou Brown, Judy Brown and Ron Fishman.

Q: Were you in the same section as Nicole?
A: I was two seats from Nicole.

Q: Two seats from Nicole.
A: Yeah, with two seats between us for our kids.

Q: And they were sitting there the  whole time?
A: No . As I told you, they were up and moving around.
 
Q: So the seats were largely empty?
A:  Not largely empty. Sometimes they were all there, and I would have 
Justin sit in my lap.
 
Q: Then who was next to your left?
A: Either Aaron or Sydney.
 
Q: Who was to your right?
A: Nobody. An aisle.  People were standing,  because it was standing room 
only.
 
Q: You had an aisle seat.
A: Yes.
 
Q:  Now, did you leave at some time during the recital?
A: Yes.
 
Q: What time did you leave?
A: I don't know.
 
Q: How long into the recital did you leave?
A: Roughly 19 dances.
 
Q: Did you have a program.
A: Yes.
 
Q: Did it show where your daughter was in  the order?
A: Yes.

Q: Near the end, you said?
A: Yes.
 
Q: When you left, did you tell anyone where you were going?
A: No.
 
Q: Before you sat down, by the way,  did you talk to anybody like who was 
outside?
A: No.
 
Q: See any friends?
A: People said hello to me and stuff,  but nobody in particular.
 
Q: No conversation?
A: No.
 
Q: Why did you get up to leave?
A: Because I noticed that the fathers were giving the kid--as the kids
were finishing their dances, they'd be leaving, and they'd have these 
bouquet of roses and things, and I had forgotten to get Sydney flowers.
 
Q: Did you ask Nicole whether she had any for you?
A: No.
 
Q: And you didn't tell anybody where you were going?
A: No.
 
Q: Did you tell them that you would  be back?
A: No.
 
Q: And you got up and left?
A: Yes.

Q: And got in your car?
A: Yes.

Q: This is the Bentley. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: And what did you do?
A: I drove to a florist.
 
Q: Where?
A: On Gorham -- I believe it's Gorham.  Gorham and San Vicente.

Q: And you bought some flowers  there?
A: Yes.

Q: And no stops in between. Right?
A: No.
 
Q: What did you buy?
A: Roses, I believe.Yes.

Q: For Sydney?
A: For Sydney.

Q: Anybody else?
A: No.

Q:  And you came back then?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And parked and went back in?
A: Yes.

Q: And sat in the same place?
A: Pretty much so, yes.

Q: Or a different place?
A: I think it was the same place.

Q: And were you carrying the roses in your hand?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you miss your daughter's performance?
A: No.

Q: And then she came on and performed at some point?
A: Yes.
  
Q: When did it end?
A: Whenever it ended. I don't know.

Q: What time was it?
A: I have no idea.

Q: What happened when it ended?
MR. BAKER: You mean the whole program or his daughter's dance?
MR.PETROCELLI: The whole program.

Q:  Did you stay till the end?
A: No.

Q: After your daughter's performance was over, the program was still going 
on?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Did you get up to leave?
A: Yes.

Q: Did the rest of the family get up to leave?
A: Some did. Some didn't.

Q: Who got up?
A: Nicole and Dominique left. I think everybody but Judy and Lou.

Q: Did you get up before Nicole and Dominique?
A: No.

Q: They got up first?
A: Yes.

Q: And then after they got up and left, you got up and left.  Right?
A: Yeah. I was standing--I stood up and stood at the entry, looking for 
Sydney.

Q: And did she come to you?
A: No, I didn't see her.

Q: Did you see her before the program was  over?
A: I believe so, yes.

Q: When did you see her?
A: Well, just minutes later, Ron Fishman had his camera and Justin was 
running around, and I said "Where's Sydney?"  And then I saw Sydney 
walking to the side of the building, and I called her and she came up, and 
Ron Fishman was going to take some pictures, but he only had one shot left, 
and he took the shot and--

Q: You gave Sydney the flowers?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you pick her up?
A: I don't think so. No.

Q: And you asked Fishman to take a picture?
A: No. He had asked earlier, "Do you have a  camera? You want to take a 
picture of the kids, you and Sydney?" This was earlier, and I said--

Q: When earlier?
A: When I first walked out.  And I said "Sure," and then when I saw 
Sydney, which was a few minutes later, he took the picture.
 
Q: So when you got up to walk out, you spoke for a bit to Fishman?
A: Yes.

Q: What did you talk about?
A: He at that point was taking the pictures.

Q: That's about it. Right?
A: Yeah.
 
Q: After the picture was taken, then what happened?
A: He was telling me about Faye Resnick.
 
Q : Where are you talking to him now at this point?
A: I think in the -- I think we were inside the -- you know, the lobby of the 
auditorium.
 
Q: Performance still going on?
A: I don't know.
 
Q: And where was Nicole and Dominique?
A: I have no idea.
 
Q: Did you ask?
A: Ask Ron Fishman?
 
Q: Yes.
A: No.
 
Q: Or ask anybody else.
A: No.

Q: Did you try to talk to Nicole?
A: I didn't see her.
 
Q: Not at all?
A: Not at all.
 
Q: So you were chatting with Fishman about Resnick?
A: Well, he was telling me. I was listening.
 
Q: What did he say?
A: He was saying, oh, boy, what's happening,  what's all this stuff that was 
going on, basically,  that Fishman was -- that Faye was in a rehab, and 
Christian and Nicole had an argument, and just that crap.

Q: What did you say?
A: For him I said, "Man, I told you, get a  lawyer;  get a shrink; get away 
from it."

Q: What else did you say?
A: That was just about it.
 
Q: When you said "get away from it," what did you mean? Get away from 
what?
A: He and his wife were having big problems, and this guy was going
wacko, and I was saying, "Get  away from it." It was just eating at him.
 
Q: Did you say anything to him in reference  to the Resnick discussion?
A: No.
 
Q: Did you comment at all about that?
A: I might have, but I don't recall what it  was.

Q: How long did that conversation last?
A: A few minutes, I guess.
 
Q: Did you talk to any other friends there?
A: People came by and said "Hi" and "Hey, what's going on," and I think I 
took a picture or two with other kids, yes.
 
Q: Did you see any of your other friends there?
A: I've seen a lot of people I knew there,  yes. I mean, these are all people--
 
Q: Can you name the people that spoke to you that you know?
A: The coach of my daughter's basketball team spoke to me. Just--
 
Q: What's his name?
A: Her name. I can't think of her name  right now.
 
Q:  Her name.
A: I helped coach the team with her, so -- but I can't think of her name now, 
and I apologize.  But I think you guys have her name. Just, you know, I 
have a -- I have everybody talk to me, so...Garvey, a lady, spoke to me. 
Just people. I mean, just everybody that was there. I mean, these people I've 
seen for years,  and they all speak and you say, "Hey, what's going on? 
Hi," blah,blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. "Sydney's beautiful. Your girl looked 
great,"  you know.
 
Q: What was your mood that evening, that time?
A: Normal.
 
Q: Normal?
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Were you upset about anything?
A: I might have been bothered by what Fishman was saying. It was sad, 
what he was saying.
 
Q: About his own personal problems with his  wife?
A: About the whole thing. About all of it.
 
Q: About what?
A: About Faye Resnick having to be put in a rehab,  Nicole not telling
Christian but telling her ex-husband. I mean, it's not--I felt bad for him.  It 
was not nice stuff to hear.
 
Q: Other than that, were you feeling normal?
A: Yes.
 
Q:  And then what did you do after you spoke to Fishman? Did you
leave?
A: No. I walked outside and was talking with Lou Brown, and I think Ron 
was joining us and, you know, the kids were running around.
 
Q: You struck up a conversation with Lou?
A: I don't know if I struck up a conversation with Lou or Lou struck up a 
conversation with me, but we were all--
 
Q: What did you talk about.
A: Just all kind of crap, whatever was  happening, what's going on, blah, 
blah, blah, whatever  this and that.
 
Q: Did you and he talk about Nicole?
A: I don't think so. I think Judy at one point, when she was worried about 
Nicole or where they  were or if they were going to dinner, at that point  Lou 
and I was teasing--I was teasing Lou about  Nicole, about avoiding Nicole.
 
Q: That you were trying to avoid Nicole?
A: That's why I wasn't going to dinner, yes.
 
Q: Did they talk to you about going to dinner?
A: Judy was running around really agitated, "Where's Nicole? I  thought we 
were going to dinner. Has anybody seen Nicole?"  So she at this point was 
asking various people where was Nicole, and I said, "I thought we were 
going to dinner. I guess we're going to dinner." And at one point I think 
Nicole was beginning to drive up,and she said to me--

Q: Who?
A: --words to the effect--Juditha--words to the effect, and it was--
 it would have been  a question at the end, "You're not going to dinner with 
us?" or "Are you going to dinner with us?" or something like that.
And I said, "Oh, no," and then Lou and I started teasing about it, and
that's what you saw on the video when you saw Lou and I laughing as we 
were walking over there and stuff. That's what we were  laughing at. We 
were talking about women.
 
Q: Did Juditha invite you to dinner?
A: No. I think it was more of a question than anything. She was just talking 
about dinner, but I don't think it was her place to invite me, but that's neither 
here nor there.
 
Q: Did Nicole invite you?
A: No.
 
Q: Did anyone invite you?
A: No.
 
Q: Was there some tension between Nicole and  you?
A: That day, no, not at all. Not for me, anyway, but maybe from her.
 
Q: Do you believe that she had some tension towards you then that evening?
 
MR. BAKER: How would you know? I mean,that calls for pure 
speculation.
MR. PETROCELLI: He knew this woman for 17 years.
Q: You could tell.
MR. BAKER: I don't--
THE WITNESS: She didn't give me anything negative. She didn't exude 
anything negative towards  me, no.
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You felt everything was normal between the two of you for that
evening?
A: Yes. For that evening, yes.
 
Q: You didn't feel that she was ignoring you  or avoiding you?
A: No, not at all.
 
Q: You didn't feel that she was making a point of not being polite or
pleasant with you?
A: I don't think she made a point not to be polite at all.
 
Q: Do you think she was polite and pleasant towards you?
A: I just did not pay any attention to it,  so I don't know. I know I made a 
point to avoid her.
 
Q: Why?
A: Because I had been avoiding her.
 
Q: Why?
A: Because I didn't want any hassles.
 
MR.PETROCELLI: We're going to stop here because he has to change
the tape.
THE WlTNESS: Yeah.

THE VlDEOGRAPHER: This is the end of tape No. 2  of Volume III. The
time is approximately 3:31,  and we are off the record.
 
(Recess.)
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are on the record. The  time is approximately 
3:57. This is the beginning of tape No. 3 of Volume III.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 40 was marked for identification by the reporter  and is 
attached hereto.)
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Off the record I marked as Exhibit 40 your Rockingham phone bill for the 
month of June 1994. 476-4619 was your phone number. Correct?
A: I believe so, yes.
 
Q: In June of 1994. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: Do you know whether your phone bills showed local phone calls
to Nicole?
A: I don't--no.

Q: No?
A: I don't think so, but I don't know.

Q: Now, back to the recital for a moment. There was a break during the  
performance, right, an intermission?
A: I don't recall.

Q: You were there during that intermission. Right?
A: I don't recall if there was a break. If  there was, I must--if it was before 
the nineteenth or so dance, I would have been there, yes.

Q: Did you sit in the same seat all the time that you were sitting there?
A: Yes.

Q: During the break you sat in the-- you stood in the middle of the door  and 
stared at Nicole.  Right?
MR. BAKER: Wait. There is no foundation for that. I am going to instruct 
him not to answer. He doesn't even know that there was a break.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You were standing in the doorway staring at Nicole at some point during 
this recital. Is that true?
A: No, that's not true.

Q: In fact you were staring at her quite a bit during the recital, weren't  you?
A: No, that's not true.

Q: And you were upset with her.  Right?
A: No.

Q: There was tension between the two of you. Right?
A: I didn't think so, no.

Q: You felt tension. Right?
A: No.

Q: You were not--You were sitting at some point about three or four  rows 
behind her. Correct?
A: That would have been impossible.

Q: Why is that?
A: Because she was sitting in the last row of the auditorium the whole time.
 
Q: The entire time?
A: Yes.

Q: And you were staring at her, weren't you?
A: No.
 
Q: Have you spoken to anybody who agrees with you that Nicole was sitting 
in the back row?
A: I don't know what that means. I'm sorry.

Q: Have you spoken to anybody about where Nicole was sitting at that 
recital?
A: No.

Q: Have you spoken to someone who said to you that she was sitting in the 
last row the entire time?
A: No.

Q: There were three sections of seats.  Correct?
A: Yes.

Q: And Nicole was sitting in the middle  section. Correct?
A: Wrong.

Q: What section?
A: The right side section.

Q: And there was a middle section and a left  section. Right?
A: I believe so, yes.

Q: And you're saying that she was sitting in the last row of the right
 section the entire time?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And you were sitting on the right  seat of that last row two seats from her?
A: Yes.
 
Q: So you were the farthest corner seat.  Correct?
A: Yes.
 
Q: That's the only seat you occupied?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And the only seat you saw Nicole occupy was next to you, three seats 
away to your left. Is that right?
A: She may have moved over once or twice,  but basically, yes.
 
Q: Now, when you were speaking to Ron  Fishman, he was telling you that 
he was extremely  upset with Nicole. Right?
A: No.
 
Q: He told you that he had just discovered that his wife was having an affair 
with a young African-American man. Is that right?
A: No.

Q: He didn't mention anything of the sort to you?
A: Correct.

Q: Did you hear that from him at a   prior time?
A: No.

Q: At any time?
A: No.

Q: Did he tell you that his wife was having an affair and that he had just  
found out?
A: No.

Q: Did he tell you that Nicole was helping to cover up his wife's 
whereabouts?
A: No.

Q: Nothing of the sort ever occurred between you and Fishman, no such 
conversation?
A: No such conversation.

Q: Now, wasn't it unusual for you to not go to dinner with the family?
MR. BAKER: If there is a foundation for usualness--
HE WITNESS: What does usual mean?
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You went to a function with your children and their mother and their 
grandparents, and you had time to go to dinner, didn't you?
A: Yes.

Q: And didn't you feel it was unusual that you weren't being invited to attend 
dinner with the family?
A: No.

Q: Why not?
A: I felt if I wanted to go, I would have  gone, and Nicole was--would have 
been the only one that would have had any say, and it wouldn't have 
bothered her if I went.
 
Q: You felt you had the right to invite yourself?
A: Yes.

Q: And at that moment in time you felt that had you invited yourself, that it 
would not have  bothered Nicole?
A: Yes.

Q: Is that what your testimony is?
A: Yes.

Q: But you chose not to.
A: Yes.

Q: For what reason?
A: I didn't want to be there.

Q:  You said you wanted to avoid Nicole. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: And that's why you didn't go. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: And you don't believe Nicole was trying to avoid you. Right?
A: No.

Q: Correct?
A: Correct.

Q: Did you go directly home from the recital? Let me back up.
After you were chatting with Lou Brown, as you previously described, what 
did you then do?
A: Said goodbye to the family and went to my car and drove home.

Q: Did you ever see Nicole to say goodbye to her?
A: No.

Q: Did you see her?
A: Yes.

Q: When did you see her?
A: When they drove up in the car.

Q: Whose car?
A: Her car.
 
Q: With Denise in it?
A: No.

Q: Who was in it?
A: Sydney.

Q: Just  Sydney and Nicole?
A: Nicole might have been alone. Sydney might have been in Dominique's 
car.

Q: Is this after you had given the flowers to Sydney, had your picture taken 
and so forth?
A: Yeah.

Q: Did she drive up near you?
A: No. They drove up near the front, and we all walked towards the 
driveway in the front of the, you know, the area.
 
Q: When you saw her drive up, she stopped the vehicle?
A: Yes.

Q: What did she do?
A: I don't know. I wasn't watching her. I  was talking to the family, saying  
goodbye to the  family.

Q: Did you go over to say goodbye to her?
A: No.

Q: Then you left.
A: Yes.

Q: That's the last time you saw Nicole?
A: Yeah.
 
Q: In the car.
A: Yeah.
 
Q: And she was sitting down?
A: Uh-huh.
 
Q: In the front seat?
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Did you see her get out of the car?
A: No.
 
Q: What was she wearing that evening?
A: I don't recall. I think a blue dress.
 
Q:  Was it a long dress or short dress or a medium dress or what?
A: Probably medium short.
 
Q: And did she look nice?
A: She always looks great.
 
Q:  Can you tell me a little bit more about her appearance that evening, what 
she was wearing and so forth?
A: No.
 
Q: A single dress outfit
A: Yes.
 
Q: Would you characterize it as a short  dress?
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Above the knees?
A: I would think so, yes. Or at the knees. I don't know.
 
Q: How far above the knees?
A: I don't know.
 
Q: Did she have any jewelry on?
A: I really didn't look at her, so I  couldn't tell you. I didn't really stare to  
see what  jewelry she had on or anything. I didn't look at her that closely.
 
Q: Was her dress a black dress, Mr. Simpson?
A: I thought it was blue.
 
Q: Short sleeves?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Or were there straps?
A: I think they were straps.
 
Q: Low-cut dress?
A: Maybe.
 
Q: What kind of shoes did she have on?
A: I didn't look to see.
 
Q: Did she have any hosiery on?
A: I would just--no, I don't know. I would say probably not.
 
Q: And you noticed no jewelry?
A: I didn't really look at her to see what she had on really.
 
Q: How was her hair fixed?
A: I don't recall. Like it always is.

Q: Which was what?
A: Regular.

Q: Did she have any hairpieces on it?
A: I didn't really look hard to see.

Q:  Bows or ribbons or anything.
A: I didn't look to see.

Q: When you left there, you drove in your Bentley straight to Rockingham?
A: Yeah.

Q: When you got to Rockingham, what did you do?
A: I may have gone to the restroom
 
Q: Let me back up. Where did you park your  car?
A: I pulled inside.

Q: In the Ashford entrance. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: And where you parked it is where the Bentley was last parked that 
evening. Right?
A: Well, the same area, yeah.
 
Q: In other words, you didn't drive it again. Is that correct?
A: That's incorrect.

Q: Okay. So you parked the Bentley in the driveway?
A: Yeah, wherever, the parking area.

Q: Got out of the Bentley?
A: Yeah.

Q: And then what did you do?
A: I went in my house.
 
Q: And you were alone. Right?
A: Yeah.

Q: And you entered the front door?
A: Yeah. I believe so.

Q: Was the alarm on?
A: I don't recall.

Q: And what did you do then?
A: I know--I may have gone to the restroom. I was going to go to Paula's, 
and I believe  Kato came in.

Q: What time is it now when you arrived at  the house?
A: I don't recall.

Q:  What's your best estimate of the time?
A: 7:00 o'clock maybe. I could be wrong.  Could be 6:00 o'clock. Whatever 
length of time it  took for the affair to end, and I was three or four minutes 
away from my house.

Q: No stops in between?
A: No.

Q:  When you got into the house-- Withdrawn.  Did you make any calls from 
the Bentley on the way home?
A: No.

Q:  Did you have a phone in that car?
A: I don't believe so, no.

Q: Where was your cell phone?
A: Probably in the Bronco.

Q: That was parked out on Ashford?
A: Yes.

Q: And then when you went inside
A: No--yes, yes, I believe Ashford, yes.

Q: That's what you previously said.
A: Yes.

Q: When you went inside, what did you then do?
A: At some point Kato came in. I know I was  planning--getting ready to go 
to Paula's.

Q: Still dressed in the clothing you wore to the recital?
A: Yes. And I was going to go to Paula's. I believe I put a call in to
Paula's, but Kato came and--and Kato came, and then Kato and I just
started talking. 

Q: Where?
A: I think--I'm not sure, but I think we 're still in the kitchen,but we could 
have been in my TV room.

Q: What number did you call for Paula?
A: Probably her home number.

Q: Did you call the 305 number also?
A: I don't remember.

Q: You don't remember?
A: No.

Q:  And what did Kaelin and you talk about?
A: The game--

Q: What game?
A: Whatever game was on that day.

Q: This was in your family room.
A: There or the kitchen. I don't remember what place. The game. He
asked me about the recital. I think I talked--told him I had spoken to his 
friend who had called, and just boy talk.
  
Q: What does that mean?
A: Most of the time when boys talk, they talk about girls.

Q: You were talking about your having called this woman?
A: Yeah. I told him I had spoken with her, and she was very nice. 
 
Q: What did you talk about concerning the recital?
A: Oh, that Sydney was really something to see.
 
Q: Was that it?
A: Yeah. He may have said something about  Nicole.
 
Q: What did he say?
A: I don't remember. He asked me how was Nicole, and I said "She was 
gorgeous," and we talked about women, you know. I may have told him  a 
little  about what was going on. I may have told him a little  bit about what 
was going on with these girls. I'm not sure.
 
Q: What girls?
A: Cora, Faye, Nicole.
 
Q: What did you say in that regard?
A: I don't know. Something--I'm not sure,  but I could have spoken to him 
about Cora and the  women.
 
Q:  What did you say about Nicole?
A:  I don't remember.
 
Q: You have no recollection at all?
A: No.
 
Q:  Did you tell Cora--Excuse me. Did you tell Kaelin that you were upset 
with Nicole's attire?
A: No.
 
Q: Did you tell him that you were upset that [l her dress was too short?
A: No. I may have made a comment about women, these girls, in connection 
with the Tracy Adele being a  businesswoman and these other girls relying 
on their sex appeal, wearing short skirts and stuff, and what are they gonna 
do when they get older, words to that effect.
 
Q: When they're grandmas?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Did you make that comment?
A: It wasn't short skirts I think it was more tight than short.
 
Q: Tight skirts?
A: Yeah.

Q: Nicole had on a tight skirt that night. Right?
A: No.

Q: Did you tell Kaelin that Nicole was wearing a black miniskirt?
A: I don't think she was.

Q: Did you tell Kaelin that?
A: I wouldn't have told him that if she didn't wear that.
 
Q: In reference to Nicole, did you say to Kaelin, "What is she going to wear 
when she's a grandma? Is she going to wear those dresses when  she's a 
grandma?"
A: I don't think quite the way you said it.  I may have referred to "these 
girls," speaking of the group as in general, when they get older--"They  ain't 
doing nothing now. What are they gonna do when  they get to be grandmas? 
I can see them when they're grandmas." Because I have said this many 
times: "I  can see them when they're grandmothers," even to  Nicole, 
"walking around with these tight short skirts," and we used to laugh about it.
 
Q: By your actions and your demeanor and your comments to Kaelin, you 
were expressing that you were upset with the way Nicole was dressed?
A: Not at all.
 
Q: Is that right?
A: Not at all.
 
Q: You were expressing that you were upset that she would not let you see 
the kids.  Correct?
A: I don't think so, not talking about her dresses. About seeing the kids, no. 
I don't think Nicole would ever keep me from seeing my kids, no.
 
Q:  Didn't you tell Kaelin that you were upset that she wasn't letting you see 
the kids that night?
A: I don't think I said to Kato I was "upset," using your words. I don't think 
I used that  word at all.
 
Q: Did you use a word that means the same?
A: I don't think so at all.
 
Q: Did you tell him that you were unhappy or upset or disappointed
that you were not invited to dinner and that you were not included in this 
family  outing?
A: Not at all.
 
Q: You said no such thing. Is that right?
A: Exactly.
 
Q: Did you tell him that you wanted to spend  time with the children this 
evening?
A: No.
 
Q: How did you get into a discussion with  Kaelin about Nicole?
A: We were talking about women,  and he was asking about the recital. 

Q: Did you tell Kaelin that you were pissed off towards Nicole?
A: No.

Q: Pissed off at all?
A: No.

Q: Were you?
A: No.

Q:  Were you feeling upset or angry at all?
A: No.

Q: Were you feeling depressed?
A: No.

Q: Unhappy?
A: No.

Q: None of those feelings?
A: No.

Q: Were you feeling upbeat?
A: I think I was tired.

Q:  How would you describe your mood and demeanor when you were 
talking to Kaelin?
A: Kicked back, tired, laid back.

Q: Not upset about anything.
A: No.

Q: Did you tell Kaelin what Fishman said?
A: I may have. I think--I may have.

Q: Can you think of anything else that you and Kaelin discussed?
A: No.

Q: You were still in the clothing from your  recital. Right.
A: Yes.

Q: What did you then do?
A: I changed.

Q: What did Kaelin do?
A: I don't know.

Q: By the way, how did he get into your house?
A: I -- if I was in the family room and he was walking by, I would have let 
him in the back  door. Otherwise, if I was in the kitchen, he walked  into the 
kitchen area where I was. When I saw him, I may have let him in there.

Q: In either event he would not have invited  himself in. Right?
A: No.

Q: He would have to be invited in by you.  Right?
A: If he saw me, he could have knocked on the door and said "Hey,"
and I would have said, "Come on in," yes.
 
Q:  But he would not have come in on his own?
A: He's never done that, I don't think. Not with me around. No.

Q: When you went to change, did he leave  the house?
A: Well, when we finished talking, he left the house.

Q: Where did he go?
A: You have to ask him.

Q:  Did he ask you if he could use the jacuzzi?
A: He may have, yes. It may have been when he asked me about the jacuzzi.

Q: What did you say?
A "Yeah."

Q: He needed permission to use the jacuzzi. Right?
A: Well, he asked me.

Q: Is that the first time he ever asked you?
A: As far as I know, yes.

Q: You went upstairs and changed. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: What did you do with your shoes? You said you had some black loafers 
on.
A: Took them off upstairs.

Q: Where did you put them?
A: Probably in my closet where I change.

Q: What did you do with your socks?
A: If I had on socks, I either put them in the shoes or in the drawer.

Q: Did you have on a pair of socks?
A: I don't recall.
 
Q: If you were wearing socks, what color would they have been?
A: Black.
 
Q: Do you remember if you were wearing  socks?
A: No.
 
Q: Did you have--What did you do with your  pants?
A: Hung them up.
 
Q: In the closet. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: The sock drawer was in the closet. Is  that right?
A: Yes.

Q: What about the shirt?
A: Hung it up.
 
Q: And the jacket?
A: Yes. Well, I folded it, put it on a shelf.
 
Q: And then you put on the golf pants and the golf shirt. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: And Reeboks and white socks. Right?
A: No, not Reeboks. Just white socks at that point in time.

Q: And what did you do then?
A: I went downstairs and was--actually I packed my suit sometime--I packed 
my suit, put my suit--put it together inside of that suit bag and laid out my 
Louis Vuitton bag and probably put some socks and underwear in that. Then 
I went downstairs, and then I--well...

Q: Did you make any phone calls?
A: I don't believe so.

Q: Did you make any phone calls at all from the time you got back to
Rockingham from the recital until the time you called Barbieri on your cell 
phone 10:03?
A: Yes.

Q: Who did you call?
A: I called a girl named Gretchen--

Q: Who is Gretchen?
A: A friend of mine.
 
Q: Was she a friend at that time?
A: Yes.

Q: A girlfriend?
A: She was a girl and she was a friend, yes.

Q: Did you have a romantic relationship with her?
A: No.

Q: Had you ever?
A: No.

Q: How long had you known her?
A: On and off. When I say "on and off," I  knew her and her boyfriend three 
or four years--three or four years.

Q: Did she have a boyfriend at the time?
A: I don't believe so.
 
Q: And how did you know that?
A: She told me.

Q: When had you last spoken to her before June 12th?
A: Two or three weeks prior to that.

Q: Were you contemplating dating her?
A: Possibly.

Q: Did you discuss that with her--
A: No.
 
Q: --two or three weeks before?
A: No.

Q: But you knew she was unattached. Right?
A: Well, two or three weeks previous I knew  she was unattached.

Q: And you hadn't heard from her since. Right?
A: No.

Q: Is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And you called her?
A: Yes.

Q: And tell me about that phone call.
A: It was a message machine on, and I just left a message.

Q: What was the message you left?
A: I don't know.

Q: In substance what was it?
A: "What's going on? What are you up to? I'm around. I'm alone," you
know, something like  that, and, "I'll be back in town. Give me a buzz.  Let 
me know what's going on with you."

Q: Was this-- did this call occur before or  after you changed your
 clothes?
A: I don't remember.

Q: Was Kaelin in the room at the time?
A: No.

Q: Before or after you spoke to Kaelin?
A: I don't know.

Q: What's your best recollection?
A: I don't have one.

Q: Did she live in Lomita, Gretchen Stockdale?
A: I don't think so.

Q: Let me show you a telephone call at 7:32 p.m. on June 12 from your 
Rockingham residence to Lomita. This is Exhibit 40. Tell me if that's the  
call that you made to Stockdale.
A: Where is it, now?

Q: It's 7:32 p.m.
A: I don't recognize the phone number, but  it could very well be.

Q: The time about right.
A: Yeah.

Q: Have you told me everything you said in the message?
A: For the most part, that I recall, yes.

Q: Did you say something in the message to the effect that, "Hi, this is OJ. 
I'm unattached for the first time in my life"?
A: Possibly.
 
 Q: Was that true?
 A: Possibly.
 
Q: And why were you unattached from Paula at that time?
A: Well, Paula and I was trying to get back together. I don't--I didn't 
consider Paula and I an attachment or unattachment.
 
Q: You didn't consider Paula--
A: An unattachment or a total attachment, but I don't think I was really 
thinking about Paula at that time.
 
Q: But you previously testified that at that  time you were involved in a 
monogamous romantic relationship with Paula.
A: That's right.
 
Q: You didn't consider that an attachment?
A: We were working on--we were being  monogamous, and we were 
working on putting our relationship back together, yes.
 
Q: But you were trying to establish another relationship with Gretchen on the 
12th. Right?
A: No, I was not. I was not doing that  at  all.
 
Q:  But you did say you were unattached for the first time in your life.  
Correct?
A: Yes.Yes.

Q: Did Stockdale ever call you back, by the way?
A: No.
 
Q: Never heard back from her?
A: No.
 
Q:  After you changed and came downstairs, what did you do?
A: What do you mean? Are we talking about phone calls now or just---

Q: You went upstairs; you changed; you laid out your Vuitton, you came 
downstairs, you said--
A: Yes.

Q:-- in socks with no shoes on. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: And what did you do?
A: Phone calls, I don't know where they fell  in here--

Q: What phone calls?
A: You were just asking me about phone  calls. Now you're going to another 
subject.

Q: No. That's one call you made to Stockdale. Were there other calls?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Who did you call?
A: Christian Reichardt. Sydney Simpson. Maybe Michelle. I may have
returned a call to Michelle. I'm not sure.
 
Q: Who is Michelle?
A: She was my ex-housekeeper.
 
Q: Abudrahm?.
A: Yes. I'm not sure of that, but I may have--it seems as if I spoke to her that 
night.
 
Q: Sydney is your daughter?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And Christian was Faye's boyfriend?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Now, did you make any other phone calls?
A: I don't think so.
 
Q: Did you make one to each of these three  people?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And these calls were all made from the Rockingham residence?
A: Yes.
 
Q: What telephone?
A: Either the kitchen or the TV room.
 
Q: And this is after you had changed back into your golf clothes. Is that 
right?
A: I believe so, yes.
 
Q: Yesterday you said you couldn't recall the color of the shirt. Can you 
recall it today?
A: No.
 
Q:  Now, were all these three calls-- tell me what time they all took place.
A: All before I went to get a hamburger.
 
Q: You went to get a hamburger around 9:00 o'clock?
A: Yeah.
 
Q: P.M.?
A: I believe so.
 
Q: What was the order of these three calls?
A: I don't know.
 
Q: Did you go to get a hamburger earlier + than 9:00 p.m.?
A: No.
 
Q: What did you say to Christian Reichardt,  and what did he say to
you?
A: I just asked him how he was doing,  and he told me somewhat of 
basically of what had  transpired.

Q: With Faye's intervention?
A: Yes.

Q: Is that the only subject discussed?
A: Yes. And us getting together.

Q: You and Christian?
A: Yeah. I told him maybe Paula had a friend and that I'd be back in town, 
and possibly we could have dinner Wednesday night.
 
Q: Any discussion about the recital?
A: No.
 
Q: About Nicole?
A: No, other than the intervention.
 
Q:  Nothing else?
A: Nothing else.
 
Q:  Who did you call--You don't remember  the order of the calls. Right?
A: No, I don't.
 
Q: What was your call with Michelle about?
A: I don't recall. Maybe--I don't really  recall. It just seems that I spoke to 
her that day,  but I can't really recall if I did or didn't.
 
Q:  Do you even remember whether it was in the evening that you made this 
call--
A: No.
 
Q: --to Michelle?
A: No.
 
Q:  Could have been earlier?
A: Yeah, could have been earlier.
 
Q:  Same thing with Christian?
A: No.Christian was after the recital.
 
Q: You told him what Fishman had told you?
A: Yeah. I was calling to see how he was doing. It sounded like he had a 
tough time.
 
Q: And Sydney.
A: Uh-huh.
 
Q: When did you call Sydney?
A: Somewhere in that period of time.
 
Q: Where did you call Sydney?
A: At her house.
 
Q: Where was that?
A: On Bundy.
 
Q: Was anyone home?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Who answered?

Q: Did you say hello to her?
A: I don't recall.

Q: Did she say anything to you?
A: No.

Q: Did you say, "This is OJ?"
A: No.

Q: You just said, "Let me speak to Sydney?"

A: I said, "Hey, is Sydney still up," or words to that effect.

Q: What did she say?
A: She got Sydney.
 
Q: What did she say?
A: She got Sydney.

Q:  Did she say anything to you?
A: She got Sydney.

Q:  Did she say, 'Yes, she is. I'll get her?"
A: She got Sydney.

Q:  I am not asking you what she did. I am asking you if she said anything in 
response to your  statement.
A: No.

Q:  Now, how long did it take for Sydney to  get on the phone?
A: I don't know.

Q: What time was this call?
A: I don't know.

Q: But you clearly fix it prior to going to  get the hamburger. Right?
A: Yes.

Q: Tell me about the discussion with Sydney Simpson.
A: It wasn't a discussion. I was just telling her how great she was, and I told 
her that I'd be back by next weekend. I may not get back till Saturday 
because of a wedding I was going to in San Francisco and--but we were 
definitely going to Knotts Berry Farm on Sunday.
MR. KELLY: Going where? I'm sorry.
THE WITNESS: Knotts Berry Farm on Sunday.

wouldn't be around Friday, but I'd definitely be there  Saturday.

Q: When was the last time, before this occasion on the evening of June 12 
that you called the Bundy house, Nicole answered and you didn't even say 
hello to her?
A: Maybe a week before.
 
Q: You did the same thing then?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And what was the last time before then?
A: Probably during--a long period of time,  the year before.
 
Q: This was behavior that you would engage in toward her when you were 
not feeling good towards her?
A: When I was avoiding her, yes. I  don't know if that's behavior. I call and 
people call me and says, " Is Jason home?" and I say "Yeah," and I get  
Jason. I call her and say, "Is Sydney there?" She gets her. I don't know if 
that's a behavior. I don't  understand what you mean by "behavior."
 
Q:  You don't think there was anything  unusual about calling her and
her answering the phone and not saying a word to her other than, "Let me 
speak  to Sydney"?
A: Yeah. "Is Sydney there? Is Sydney still  up?" No, I don't think that is 
unusual.
 
Q:  But in other words, you were not trying to be friendly towards her.  
Right?
A: I was calling to speak to Sydney.
 
Q:  You were not attempting to engage her in any kind of conversation? 
Correct?
A: True.True.
 
Q: You were trying to avoid her, as you said. Right?
A: At this instance I was trying to speak to Sydney.
 
Q: You had been trying to avoid her  earlier.
A: I wasn't trying. I succeeding, for the most part.
 
Q: You were trying and succeeding to avoid her?
A: Yes.
 
Q: You were angry with her. Right?
A: No.
 
Q: You got into an argument on this call, didn't you?
A: No.
 
Q: And you made her cry, didn't you?
A: No.
 
Q: Your daughter Sydney overheard  that,  didn't she?
A: No.
 
Q: Are you positive?
A: Positive.
 
Q: But you were angry at her,  weren't you?
A: No.
 
Q: You deny that?
A: Yes.
MR. BAKER: Don't answer. You have taken wide latitude, and I let you 
have wide latitude, but you're way out of bounds.
MR. PETROCELLI: I've taken appropriate  latitude.
MR. BAKER: Well, that's in the eyes of the beholder, and I don't think so.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  Was that the last phone call you made that evening before calling Paula 
later on at 10:00 o'clock or thereabouts?
A: I believe so, yes.
 
Q:  What did you do after you got off the phone with Sydney?
A: I don't know, because I don't  know what  time I got off the phone with 
Sydney.
 
Q: What did you do next?
A: Next when?
 
Q:  After you hung up.
A:  I don t know during that period of time what time I got off the phone 
with Sydney, so I can't l really say what I did next.

Q:  Were you with anyone?
A: No.
 
Q: You were alone in the house.  Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And were you packing?
A: At what point are we talking now?
 
Q:  When you got off the phone with Sydney  and before you went to 
McDonald's?
MR. BAKER: That's argumentative in view of what he just told you.
MR. PETROCELLI: I am trying to--
MR. BAKER: No, you're not. You're trying to  trip him up.
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Trip him up?
MR. BAKER: What a shocking assertion. And in view of his testimony that 
he doesn't know what time it was--
MR. PETROCELLI: I didn't ask him what time it  was. I just want to know 
without regard to time, what you did next.
MR. BAKER: If you can sequence it, tell him. If you can't--
THE WlTNESS: I can't because I don't know exactly what time it was that I 
called any of these people.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Well, you did say it was before you went get a hamburger.
A: Yes, I do know that.
 
Q:  After you hung up with Sydney, is the next thing you remember then
getting a hamburger?  
A: I don't recall what the next thing was.  I may have talked to Christian may 
have been the next  thing. I don't  recall what the next thing was.
 
Q:  After you made the calls to Christian and Sydney, is the next thing you
remember getting a  hamburger?
A: I really don't recall exactly when  that was, so I can't tell you exactly 
when it was we got a  hamburger.
 
Q:  When you got home and after you had changed, other than making the 
phone calls to  Christian and Sydney, can you remember a single thing  that 
you did?
A: Yes.
 
Q: What?
A: I packed,I got my car and brought  it in and got my clubs and--out of it, 
and I put my clubs in the golf bag.
 
Q:  When you said you "packed, " you had already laid out the Louis Vuitton 
bag--
A: Yes.
 
Q: --in the closet.Correct.
A: Yes.
 
Q: You had already put your socks and underwear in it. Right?
A: I believe so, yes.
 
Q: When you just said now that you packed after these phone calls, what did 
you mean?
A: I thought you said to me after I got  home--
 
MR. LEONARD: That wasn't the question.
THE WITNESS: Will you go back to the question he asked me?

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Let me ask--
MR. BAKER: No.
THE WITNESS: Would you go back to the question he asked me?
 
MR.PETROCELLI: Please feel free to go back.
 
(Record read from Page 916, Line 23 through Page 917, Line 7.)
 
MR.BAKER: He didn't say he packed after the phone calls.
MR. PETROCELLI: He did, too.
MR. LEONARD: No, he did not.
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me go back to the prior question.
 
THE WITNESS: You go back to the prior question.
MR. PETROCELLI: Let's go back.
 
(Record read from Page 916, Line 14 through Page 917, Line 7.)
MR. BAKER: Very clever, but we're not buying your questions because
you asked him "other than,"  so--
MR. LEONARD: Not after.
MR. BAKER: Yeah. So he answered your question correctly.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Are you unable to sequence, to use your counsel's word, the order  of the 
following events after you came back and after you talked to Kato Kaelin? 
And I am talking about after  you came back from the recital--
A: Yes.
 
Q: --and after you spoke to Kaelin?
A: Yeah.
 
Q: Changing clothes, packing,  phone calls to Sydney--phone call to Sydney 
and phone call to Christian.
MR. BAKER: That's compound.

BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Are you able to sequence those for me?
MR. BAKER: That's compound in the events, and he has already sequenced
part of those for you.
MR. PETROCELLI: I believe he said that he went upstairs and he changed.
MR. BAKER: That's right.
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

Q: So after changing, did you pack before you made the phone calls to
Sydney and Christian?
A: I began to pack before I made the  phone calls to Sydney and Christian.

Q:  Did you pull the Bronco in before you  called Sydney and Christian?
A: I don't recall.
 
Q: Tell me about pulling the Bronco in. You  walked out the door and went 
out the Ashford--
A: Yeah, I went out on Ashford.
 
Q: What did you do?
A: Pulled the Bronco in, took the  golf clubs out, packed the golf clubs -- got 
my cover, packed my golf  clubs into the cover, pulled the Bronco outside of 
the gate, and I believe I
 grabbed my phone at that point and ran back in.
 
Q: When you pulled the golf clubs out, you put it in the cover bag and put it 
out on the south bench. Correct?
A: Yeah, my cover bag was in my  lobby--
 
Q:  Right.
A: I mean my foyer.
 
Q:  Did you pull anything else out besides  the golf clubs?
A: At that point in time, I don't believe so.

Q:  Like the cell phone case or--
A: As I just said, I pulled the Bronco out,  and I believe I got my cell phone 
when I came back in from outside.

Q:  I am confused. When did you get your cell phone--
MR. BAKER: That's not the test.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q:  When you did you get your cell phone from the Bronco?
A: When I--in that period of time when I l parked--when I pulled the Bronco 
out and I came back in, I had  my cell phone.
 
Q:  Okay. When you -- you were  parked on Ashford, but when you  parked 
after taking your golf clubs out, you parked on Rockingham. Is that--
A: Yes.

Q: what you're saying?
A: Yes.
 
Q:  Why didn't you park on Ashford, where you always parked?
A: I didn't want my dog to go out, and I was  trying to keep my dog from 
going out on the street.

Q: Doesn't that happen whenever you pull your Bronco out?
A: Normally what I do when I'm leaving, I sit in the gate -- in the morning, 
if I'm taking the Bentley, I'll sit in the gate, pull open the gate-- pull up to the 
gate. I'll sit there until the gate begin to close, and I'll leave.
That's what most of the people who have lived at my house do so our dogs 
don't go out. 
 
Q:  And did you do that on this occasion when you were pulling the Bronco 
out?
A: No, because I can see that -- I didn't see the dog near me, and I pulled it 
out and came back in real  quick so that he couldn't go out -- she wouldn't 
go out. And also because I didn't -- I don't think I had my door key, and I 
didn't want to walk all the way around.
 
Q: When you pulled the Bronco out and parked it, you were able to get back 
in through the Rockingham gate before it closed?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And you didn't have your keys  with you?
A: Even if I didn't have --yeah, I didn't  have my keys with me.
 
Q:  You did not?
A: No.
 
Q: And that's when you took the cell phone out with you?
A: Yes.
 
Q: But not the windbreaker or the  cell phone  case?
A: No.
 
Q: What time is it when you parked the Bronco?
A: I don't know. It was in that period of  time, though.
 
Q:  Now, you knew that you were going to be  gone for a few days. Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q: You were prepared to leave the Bronco out  on Rockingham?
A: Yes. Gigi may have used it when she got there Monday, but--

Q: She had a key to it.
A: Always kept a key in the house.
 
Q: When you usually park--Well, withdrawn. Whenever you park the 
Bronco on Rockingham, how do you get back in through the gate?
A: Whenever?
 
Q: Yeah. When you park the Bronco on  Rockingham, how do you get back 
into the property?
A: Sometimes with a key. Sometimes if I had the puncher in the Bronco or 
the clicker or whatever you call that. But back in--normally the only other  
times that I recall parking on Rockingham was normally  because of getting 
my newspaper or, you know, people park somewhere or I see somebody I 
know or something.

Q: Without the key, you still could have parked on Ashford and pushed
 open the Ashford gate and  gotten  into that property. Correct?
A: Correct.That's correct.

Q: That would have required you to walk to the gate on Ashford. Right?
A: And probably look for my dog.

Q:  Now, when you parked the car, you went back inside. Do you remember 
what you did next?
A: I went in the house and either I made  some phone calls or I read or -- I 
know I did some reading in that period of time, so maybe I was sort of 
watching TV and reading or all the above.

Q:  During this time were you with anyone?
A: No.

Q: When you said you made some phone calls, you mean the calls to Sydney 
and Christian?
A: Yeah, that may have been when that happened.
 
Q: Okay.
A: And I don't even know if I did those back to back, but I know in that 
period of time I spoke to them.

Q: Had you ever put any shoes on at this point in time?
 A: No.
 
Q: So when you went out to pull in the car and do all that, you had just
 socks on. Right? 
A: Yes.

Q: When you took your socks off later in the  evening, what did do you with 
them.
A: Put them in my hamper.

Q:  How long were you in the house before you l went to get a burger?
 A: I don't know.

Q: Did you decide to go get a hamburger?
A: Yes.

Q: Was it your suggestion?
A: To myself?

Q: To yourself?
A: No.
 
Q: Was it your idea?
A: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
MR. BAKER: That's a pretty funny question.
MR. PETROCELLI: It is funny.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. Pardon me?
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: You decided to go get a hamburger.  Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And then what did you do?
A: I think--I think before I decide--before I went upstairs to get my shoes, I 
noticed Kato  had left the  jacuzzi on. and I put it off, told him I that he had 
to be careful with that and  -- "Be careful with that, with the jacuzzi, because 
sometimes you think it's all the way off and it's not." Then I went back in, I 
went upstairs,  put on my shoes, I guess grabbed some money, and that's 
when I realized I really didn't have any change.
 
Q:  When you told Kato to be careful,  did you do that in person?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And you saw the jacuzzi was on, and how  did you go get Kato?
A: Walked.
 
Q: Walked to his room?
A: Well, to the top--the jacuzzi's on the patio, and his room--the other part of 
the patio. I walked and I said "Hey, Kato,"  because I could see him through 
the door.
 
Q: He was in his room
A: Yes.

Q:  You said "Hey, Kato" what?
A: Because I wanted to talk to him.

Q: Did he come out?
A: Yes.

Q:  What did you say to him?
A: I told him, "You have to be careful when l you use the jacuzzi because 
when you think it's off,  you got to  look for the little bubbles because it's  
still on. You know, you turned off the blower, but you didn't turn off the 
other little jets."

Q: Were you upset with him?
A: No.
 
Q: And did you ask him to dinner with you?
A: No.

Q: Then what did you do? You went  upstairs and put your shoes on?
A: Put my shoes on, got some money. Didn't have any change

Q: How much money did you get?
A: I don't know.

Q:  Where did you get it from?
A: My vanity.

Q: What were the smallest bills you had?
A: 1's.

Q: $1 bills?
A: Yes.

Q:  What were you looking for in terms of  change?
A: Enough to buy a burger, and then I  thought about I would need some
 money for the skycap.

Q: How much money did you have on your vanity?
A: I don't know. Maybe $6-, $7-, $8-, $9,000.

Q: On your vanity?
A: At that time, yes.

Q: In all denominations?
A: No.

Q:  What did you have?
A: Hundred dollars bills.

Q:  And some 1$ bills. Right?
A: Two 1$ bills.

Q: The rest were all hundreds and higher?
A: Just hundreds.

Q:  Was some of this money underneath the sweater?
A: Not at this time, no.

Q: All on the vanity?
A: At that point, yes.

Q:  How long had it been there?
A: Probably since I'd been back from the golf course.

Q:  You had that money with you at the golf  course?
A: Yes.
 
Q:  Did you win that money at the golf course?
A: I don't know if I won or lost that day.

Q: When you came downstairs then, where did l you go next?
A: I went and asked Kato if he had change, did he have any--could he break 
a hundred.

Q: You went out to his room again?
A: Yeah.
 
Q: And what did he say?
A: Well, he walked out the door, and he said--and I said, "I need" -- "Can 
you break a hundred? Because I'm gonna go get a burger, and I need some 
money for the skycap."

Q:  What did he say?
A: He walked in--he said "No," but then when he walked out, he gave me a 
$20 bill. He said,  "Here, take this."

Q:  He said he didn't have change of a  hundred?
A: He said "No," and then he handed me a 20.

Q:  What did you do?
A: Started walking -- told him "Thank you."  I started walking in the house.

Q: And then did you go out to get the burger then?
A: Well, he asked if he could go, and I said, "Sure," and we went and got  
the burger.
 
Q: And what car did you drive?
A: Bentley.
 
Q: Were you bothered by his going  with you?
A: No.

Q: Did you want to be alone?
A : No.
 
Q: You didn't ask him to go. Correct?
A: No. Correct.

Q:  You left the Rockingham exit. Is that  right? Gate, I should say?
A: Yes.

Q: And did you stop anyplace?
A: No.

Q:  You drove?
MR. BAKER: You mean other than stop signs? You mean--
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Did you make a stop anywhere, a destination stop anywhere along the 
way to the hamburger place?
A: No.

Q:  Where did you go?
MR. BAKER: Which--
THE WITNESS: McDonald's.
BY MR. PETROCELLI:
Q: Which McDonald's?
A: It's on Santa Monica.

Q: Santa Monica and what?
A: 26th Street.

Q:  You drove down which part-- which route did you take to go there?
A: Rockingham to 26th Street to Santa Monica.

Q: Rockingham--turn which way on 26th?
A: Left.

Q: Left. And then what on Santa Monica?
A: Left.
 
Q:  Left?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Is that the closest fast-food restaurant?
A: I think so, yes. I don't know about fast  food. I don't know. But certainly 
McDonald's, yes.
 
Q: Is that the closest McDonald's to Rockingham
A: I believe so, yes.
 
Q: Is there one almost as close?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Which one is that?
A: Up Wilshire near San Vicente.
 
Q: Did you ever go to that McDonald's?
A: Yes.
 
Q: Did you ever go to the one on 26th Street, did you say?
A: Yeah.For--yeah,most of the time,  yes.
 
Q: Why did you choose the one on 26th Street  this time?
A: Because in my mind, and I know for a fact  now, it's closer, and it's the 
one I've always taken  my kids to.
 
Q: When you say you "know for a fact now,"  what do you mean by that?
A: I was bothered by something that was said in court, so I clocked--and I 
didn't think it was right, so I clocked  it. So I went and clocked it with my 
mileage.
 
Q: What was the result of clocking  it?
A: That the one that I went to was  closer.
 
Q: What were the distances?
A: I don't remember.
 
Q:  How much closer was it?
A: Not much, but it was closer.
 
Q:  Did you do any other clocking  demonstrations?
A: No.
 
Q: After court -- after you got out of jail,  I should say?
A: No.
 
Q: Like between Bundy and Rockingham?
A: No.

Q: Was this a drive-through?
A: Yes.

Q:  Did anybody--did you talk to anybody  along the way besides
Kaelin?
A: No.
 
Q: And did you make any phone calls?
A: No.

Q:  Did you have a car phone there?
A: No.

Q:  When you went to the drive-in, did you order for both Kaelin and  you?
A: I may have.
 
Q: What did you have? What did you order?
A: I believe a Big Mac.

Q: Anything else?
A: Maybe some french fries, but I don't  remember.

Q: Anything to drink?
A: No.

Q:  And what did Kaelin order?
A: I don't remember.

Q:  Did you pay for it?
A: No. I mean, I handed her the money, but it wasn't the 20 he had  given 
me.

Q: It was the 20 he had given you?
A: It was not the 20 he had given me.

Q:  He gave you the money for this?
A: Yes.

Q:  An additional 20?
A: Yes.

Q:  And you gave it to the--Was it a man or a woman?
A: I believe it was a woman, but I'm not  sure. I believe it was an Hispanic
woman, but I'm not  sure.

Q:  Had you seen her before?
A: No.

Q:  How much did it cost?
A: I don't remember.

Q: Did you receive any change?
A: Yes.

Q: What did you do with the change?
A: Gave it to Kato.

Q:  How many bags did you receive?
A: One.
 
Q: And when you got the bag, did you pull  out?
A: No. He took it out, gave it to me.

Q: You gave him the bag?
A: Yeah.

Q: Then you drove off?
A: Yes.

Q: Did you eat in the car?
 A: Yes.

Q:  Did he eat in the car?
 A: I don't think so.

Q:  Did you eat your whole hamburger in the car while you were driving?
A: Yeah, I think it was done by the time I got home.

Q: And what did you do with the bag?
A: I believe, because there was lettuce in  my car and stuff--

Q:  In your Bentley?
A: Yeah.

Q:  How do you know?
A: Because I picked it up.

Q:  When you got out?
A: Yeah.

Q: What about the bag and the wrappers from your burger?
A: I think he kept the bag, and I just had the wrapper, so I either threw it in 
my gargage, (sic) which is right there, or took  it in the house and threw it in 
the garbage.

Q: Right where?
A: Right by my Bentley.

Q:  Did you or did you not eat french  fries?
A: I don't think so, but I might have.

Q:  Did you or did you not have a drink?
A: I didn't order a drink, no.

Q: What was the last time before this  occasion that you and Kato went out
for a burger  together? 
A: A burger?

Q:  Yeah.
A: I don't think we did.

Q: What was the last time that you and Kaelin before this occasion went
out to dinner together, just the two  of you?
A: Just the two of us?

Q:  Yes.
A: I don't think I ever had dinner with Kato, just the two of us.

Q: Is this the first time the two of you had ever gone out to get something
to eat?
A: No.
 
Q:  When had you done so before?
A: I think he brought his daughter the week before this with me and my  
kids. I always take my to I believe it was Sizzler, and he brought his  
daughter and they came.
 
Q: When was the last time before that that  you went out to eat with him and  
others?
A: I don't know, but maybe six months previous to that with Nicole,
and we all may have eaten somewhere. I'm not a hundred percent sure
of that.
 
Q: So this was the first time that you and  Kato had ever gone out alone to
get something to eat?
A: First time he had ever asked me to go  with me, yes.
 
Q: And you had never asked him.  Correct?
A: Never, no.
 
Q:  Did you talk to Kato on the way to and back from the burgers?
A: I'm sure we did.
 
Q: Normal conversation?
A: I guess so.
 
Q: Were you feeling quiet?
A: I was feeling tired.
 
Q: Did you talk much?
A: I don't recall. Probably not, but I  don't recall.
 
Q: Less than you usually do?
A: I don't recall.
 
Q:  You don't recall anything you discussed?
A: No.
 
Q: And you don't recall how much you talked?
A: No.
 
Q: Was Kaelin annoying you?
A: No.
 
Q:  Was he making a lot of chitchat that you  weren't interested in hearing?
A: No.
 
Q: Did he say anything?
A: I'm sure he did.
 
Q: Did he say much?
A: I don't recall.
 
Q:  Was it relatively a quiet drive to and from.
A: It was just two guys driving. You know, whatever we were talking 
about, we were talking about. May  have been the basketball game.
 
Q:  Did he eat in the car?
A: I don't think so.
 
Q: Now, when you got to the Bentley, when you drove in back to 
Rockingham-- back to your house, you drove in on Ashford. Right?
A: Yes.
 
Q:  And you pulled in your Bentley in its normal parking spot. Right?
A: That's correct.
 
Q:  And then what did you do?
A: As I said, I got out, I picked up  some lettuce and I went in the house.
 
Q: What did Kaelin do?
A: I guess he went to his room.
 
Q:  And which way did Kaelin get into his  room?
A: The way he always does, I guess.
 
Q: Around the property?
A: Yes.
 
Q: To The left of it?
A: Yes.
 
Q: And which way did you go in?
A: The front door.
 
Q:  Who went first?
A: What do you mean?
 
Q: Who went inside first?
 A: I couldn't see, so I couldn't tell.
 
Q: It was dark?
A: No. There's a whole house between my  door and his door, so I can't
tell.
 
Q: When you were at the Bentley, was Kato waiting for you--
A: I didn't--
 
Q:--to walk together to the house?
A: I don't think so because he was gone, and then I just heard him saying, 
"Hey, have a good trip," or something as he was evidently going around the  
house, but I really couldn't see.

Q: So when Kato was going around the house,  were you heading towards 
your front door?
A: Yeah.
 
Q: So the both of you had walked away from the Bentley--
A: Yeah, he had walked away; and I was  getting the lettuce and the crap that 
had fallen out  of my burger out,  and then I walked to the front door.
 
Q: By the time you closed the door of the Bentley and finished scooping up 
the lettuce, you --had he already  -- was he already out of sight?
A: I don't think so, no.
 
Q: So as you started heading towards the front door, he said something to
you?  
A: Yeah. "Have a good trip, " or something, "I'll see you, man," you know, 
some mundane thing.

Q: Did he kind of pause and wait to  see if  you would invite him in to eat
his burger in the house with you?
A: I didn't see that, no.
 
Q:  And did you ask him to come in?
A: No.
 
Q: Did Kato Kaelin see you go in the house?
A: I don't know.
 
Q: Was he in a position to see you enter the door?
A: I wouldn't know.
 
Q: You don't know.
A: No.
 
Q:  By the time you entered the front door, he was already around the house?
A: I didn't see him, so I assumed he was.
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Good stopping point?

EXAMINATION (Resumed) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Good morning, Mr. Simpson. 
 
A: Good morning. 
 
Q: Did you do any preparation for today's session? 
 
A: Absolutely none. 
 
Q: Last night you gave an interview on television? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Was there any discussion about this lawsuit? 
 
A: I don't recall if he asked me a question, but it would be on the 
tape. 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you came downstairs the first time and picked up your 
golf cover bag and picked it up and sort of signaled to the 
limousine driver, do you know if the limousine driver saw you do 
that? 
 
A: I don't know if he did, no. 
 
Q: Did he acknowledge to you that he had seen you? 
 
A: Well, his lights were on, so I couldn't see if he did. 
 
Q: Could you see the driver in the car? 
 
A: No, I couldn't. 
 
Q: So after you put the bag down and went upstairs, at that 
moment in time you did not know whether the driver had seen you. 
Is that right? 
 
A: Didn't give it a thought. 
 
Q: Is that right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: When you went to McDonald's, did you go straight there and 
straight back to the house? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: How long did it take to there? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Approximately? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: You know where it's located. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You drove at normal speed? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: About 10 minutes? 
 
A: I don't know. You mean to get there? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: Shouldn't be much more than 10 minutes, yes. 
 
Q: How long did it take to get the food? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Five or ten minutes? 
 
A: I don't know. I was not paying any attention if there was other 
cars in front of us or not. I don't have any recollection. 
 
Q: You don't recall it being a particularly long wait or anything 
like that. Correct? 
 
A: One way or the other, no. 
 
Q: And about 10 minutes to get back? 
 
A: Approximately, I guess. 
 
Q: Do you think you were gone all told about half an hour? 
 
A: Approximately, yeah. 
 
Q: Or less? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: From the time that you came back from McDonald's and went 
into the house until the time that you picked up the phone in your 
bedroom and spoke to Alan Park, did you see any person? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did any person see you? 
 
A: I wouldn't know that. 
 
Q: To your knowledge did any person-- 
 
A: I-- 
 
Q: To your knowledge did any person see you? 
 
A: I don't have knowledge. I don't know who was where and who 
was looking. So I didn't see anybody, so I don't know who saw me 
or not. 
 
Q: And you weren't with anyone. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And during that time period did you speak to anyone? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: Sydney Simpson, Christian Reichardt, possibly Michelle-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Are we talking about after he got back? 
 
THE WITNESS: He-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, that was my question. Let me reframe it. 
 
THE WITNESS I didn't understand 
 
MR. KELLY: Could I have the last question read Back, as a matter 
of fact, please. 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
Record read from Page 954, line 18  through Page 954, Line 23.) 
 
MR. KELLY: Can you go back one more question? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Mr. Simpson, while we were off the record a moment, you said 
you wanted to correct yourself. 
 
A: Yes. I was--during the time I got home that was the case, but I 
spoke to them before I went to McDonald's. That was right before I 
went to McDonald's. 
 
Q: That you spoke to them. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Is that what you're saying.? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: You clear on that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: From the time that you came back from McDonald's and went 
into the house until the time that you picked up the phone in the 
bedroom and spoke to Alan Park-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --did you speak to anyone? 
 
A: No. Not personally, no. 
 
Q: You added the word "personally." I don't know whether that 
changes anything. The question is: During that time frame did you 
speak to anyone? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did anyone speak to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: During that time frame do you know of any person other than 
yourself who can account for your whereabouts? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Let me show you the next -- the document which I will mark as 
the next exhibit in order, Exhibit 41. For other counsel to see, I am 
going to be showing-- 
 
MR. KELLY: Are you going to be able to photocopy that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I have photocopied it. Not in color. Okay? 
 
Q: While we are passing out the copies, Mr. Simpson, I will show 
you what I am going to ask you a question about. 
 
MR. BLASIER: Is there a trial exhibit number on that? 
 
MR. GELBLUM: Trial Exhibit 120. 
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 41 was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: What I would like you to do is go to the photo in the top right-
hand comer, this one (Indicating). Do you see that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, that depicts what? 
 
A: The front entry to my house 
 
Q: And the distance between the front door and the beginning of 
the driveway you approximated yesterday at 15 feet. Correct? 
 
A: 15 feet, yeah. 
 
Q: And when you came out the first time partially dressed and 
picked up the golf cover bag and laid it down, motioned to the 
limousine driver, you said yesterday you came out approximately 
halfway. Right? 
 
A: No. I came to the bench, which is approximately halfway. 
 
MR. BAKER: He said he came to the west end of the bench. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: The west end of the bench, which is approximately halfway-- 
 
A: That's incorrect. 
 
Q: --Out to the driveway. Correct? 
 
A: That's totally incorrect. 
 
Q: What is incorrect about it? 
 
A: It's not approximately halfway. 
 
Q: What is it? 
 
A: Probably three quarters of the way. 
 
Q: Could you mark where you came out? 
 
A: When? I mean, I came out--I got 
 
Q: I am only talking about this one point in time when you came 
downstairs partially dressed to pick up your golf cover bag, 
motioned to the limousine driver, put it down on the ground. 
 
A: You want me to mark it on it? 
 
MR. BAKER: You did it yesterday. He is not going to do it today. 
He did it yesterday. Don't mark it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I have an exact picture of the location, Mr. 
Baker, and I don't know that he did yesterday, but I'll take your 
word for it if he did. 
 
MR. BAKER: He marked on your drawing, and again it was, as I 
suggested to you, inaccurate. This is a shot that doesn't show, in 
my opinion, any level of breadth because it's tunneled into his front 
door, and I don't know how you could actually mark on that to give 
any sense of how far out the door he came. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Do you see where the benches extend out? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You have benches on either side. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you go past the benches? 
 
A: I told you approximately to that end of the bench. I don't know 
exactly to the foot that I went to, but approximately-- 
 
Q: Approximately the end of the bench. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That's as far as you went. 
 
A: That's where I threw the clubs down, yes. 
 
Q: You didn't go out any farther past that point. 
 
A: No farther past that point. 
 
Q: Then you went back inside. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Okay. 
 
A: I didn't go to the driveway. Anywhere in there I could have 
been, but I didn't go to the driveway. I wasn't marking--take one 
step here, one l step there, but I never made it to the driveway. 
 
Q: When you pulled your Bronco out to park it for the last time on 
Rockingham, you pulled it out, made a right and parked it? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And why don't we use this exhibit again, No. 41.  You see 
where the Bronco is situated in the top left-hand corner of the 
exhibit? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that where you parked it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that's where you left it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is the distance from the Rockingham gate to the front door the 
same, greater or less than the distance from the Ashford gate to the 
front door, in your opinion? 
 
A: The Rockingham is further. 
 
Q: In light of that, what was the reason why you didn't park on 
Ashford and then push the door open, as you are able to do without 
a key--you did not have a key--and then walk to the front door? 
 
MR. BAKER: It was asked and answered yesterday. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me? 
 
MR. BAKER: It was asked and answered yesterday. You can 
answer it one more time. 
 
THE WITNESS: For at least--well, never mind. I didn't want my 
dog to run out. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: But when you pulled the car out to park it on Rockingham, your 
dog could still run out. 
 
A: But he didn't run out, as I explained to you yesterday. I looked, 
I didn't see him. And if he ran out, I was there. I was there to say, 
"Come on Chachi, come back in." 
 
Q: But you were in the car. 
 
A: But I got out of the car to come back in. 
 
Q: But you could have parked around the corner and-- 
 
A: And he'd have been gone down the other corner. 
 
Q: Let me ask you this one question then. 
 
A: Jesus. 
 
Q: No matter where you parked, when you pull out of the 
Rockingham gate, the gate is still open for the same length of time, 
regardless of when you parked. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Your state of mind at that time, Mr. Simpson, was that if you 
pulled out of the Rockingham gate and parked there, you were in a 
better position to get the dog? Is that what your saying? 
 
A: My state of mind at that time was to park the car and come back 
in, and I wasn't in the mood to go for Chachi, so I didn't want 
Chachi to go out of that gate. So that was my state of mind, yes. 
 
Q: But it was still possible for Chachi to leave the gate, though. 
 
A: No. Chachi is a relatively trained dog. If I'm there, she won't go 
out. If I say, "No, Chachi. Come here," she'll come here. 
 
Q: When you exit that gate to leave the property to go someplace 
else-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --your dog can get out at any time. Correct? 
 
A: As I explained to you already, I thought in detail, normally I sit 
at the gate every morning when I go to play golf; I wait till the gate 
starts closing before I drive out of the gate every morning. 
 
Q: To make sure the dog doesn't leave. 
 
A: To make sure the dog doesn't leave. 
 
Q: You could have done so on this occasion. Correct? 
 
A: I didn't need to. 
 
Q: You could have exited, waited to see that the dog wasn't coming 
out. When the gate closed, you could have parked in your normal 
spot on Ashford. Correct? 
 
A: Why would I, since I wasn't going anywhere. So I could just 
step out of the car, which took me a matter of seconds, and say, 
"Come on Chachi. Don't go anywhere." 
 
Q: But you could have done so. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: It's physically possible. 
 
THE WITNESS: k would have been stupid to do so. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: In fact that's what you usually did? 
 
A: Correct? 
 
A: No. Because I don't usually park my car and walk back in. 
 
Q: When you park your car on Ashford, how do you get into the 
house? 
 
A: I push the gate open. 
 
Q: And you could have done so that evening. Correct? 
 
A: I didn't want to do that so--that evening. I didn't want to chase 
my dog. 
 
Q: I understand what you're saying, but there was nothing to 
prevent you from doing so. Correct? 
 
A: No, there wasn't. 
 
Q: Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: What is the total amount of time that you can estimate for me, 
Mr. Simpson, that that gate remains open such that the dog could 
get out? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Is it more than 60 seconds? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Is it more than 30 seconds? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Between 30 and 60 seconds? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Does the gate work the same way now as it did in June of 1994? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am going to attach as the next exhibit in 
order Exhibit 42.  
 
(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 42 was marked for identification by the reporter 
and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: This is a picture of your Ford Bronco, 
correct, the one you had in 1994? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: That's exactly how you parked it when you last parked it on the 
evening of June 12. Correct? 
 
A: I can't say that. 
 
Q: Does it appear to be the way you parked it? 
 
A: Yeah, approximately, yes. 
 
Q: You don't have any reason to believe that it's in a different 
location than where you last left it. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
MR. GELBLUM: That's trial Exhibit 137, for the record. 
 
MR. BLASIER: 137? Thank you. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: What does that note say? 
 
A: I really can't read it. I need glasses-- 
 
MR. BAKER: It's a communication to my client. I don't intend to 
give it to you. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Passing notes during the deposition? 
 
MR. BAKER: Yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Why? 
 
MR. BAKER: Because I want to communicate with my client. 
 
THE WITNESS: Can't read it, though. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What is the next exhibit? 44? 
 
THE REPORTER: 43. 
 
MR. GELBLUM: Trial Exhibit 136. (Plaintiffs' Exhibit 43 was 
marked for identification by the reporter and is attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Mr. Simpson, I am going to show youth next exhibit, No. 43. 
Also the color copy that I have. Do you recognize what's in the 
exhibit? 
 
A: It appears to be my car. 
 
Q: In your driveway at Rockingham. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: The "car" being the Bentley? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The car in the front. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Whose car is the one in the back? 
 
A: My daughter's, it appears to be. 
 
Q: What car is that? 
 
A: What is it, a Saab, I believe. 
 
Q: That's what she had in June of '94? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is the Bentley depicted in this photograph in the location where 
you last parked it on the evening of June 
 
A: It appears to be. 
 
Q: Is that where you normally park 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you left the premises that evening, was--were there 
any cars-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: --in the driveway? 
 
A: Well, my Bentley. 
 
Q: Other than the Bentley? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Arnelle's car was not there? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you left the golf-- the white golf ball bag and that bluish 
bag outside the Bentley after you finished hitting golf balls, was it 
right out the other side of the trunk there in the back of the car? 
 
A: What does that mean? I don't know-- 
 
Q: Where exactly did you leave the two bags in reference to your 
Bentley? 
 
A: I would say roughly--this is just not a good picture to show you 
that on. I'd be estimating on this. 
 
Q: Behind the Bentley. Correct? 
 
A: Behind the Bentley over near the glass. 
 
Q: How many feet behind the Bentley? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Where Arnelle's car is currently situated? 
 
A: Possibly. Yeah, possibly in that area, near there, yes. 
 
Q: Was it within 10 feet of the Bentley? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Or closer? 
 
A: I really couldn't tell you. But I know it was near the grass and 
the Bentley, somewhere between the grass and the Bentley. 
 
Q: Was it farther from the Bentley than the back of Arnelle's car as 
depicted in this photo? 
 
A: I can't tell how her car's parked there. I really can't. 
 
Q: Was it close to the garage? 
 
A: If you gave me another picture. I can give you a much better 
example. This picture has-- no way of showing you what's going 
on with this picture. 
 
Q: Well, if I had another picture handy, I would show it to you, but 
l don't have one at my disposal. 
 
A: I can't work from this picture and tell you. 
 
Q: But your best memory then is how many feet from the back of 
the Bentley did you leave those two bags? 
 
A: I don't have any estimate. 
 
Q: Is it less than 10 feet, though? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Could have been more? 
 
A: It could have been. 
 
Q: You have no recollection? 
 
A: No 
 
(Discussion held off the record.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: I am going to show you as the next exhibit in order, Exhibit 44-
- 
 
MR. GELBLUM: Trial Exhibit 141. (Plaintiffs' Exhibit 44 was 
marked for identification by the reporter and is attached hereto.) 
 
THE WITNESS: May I communicate in private with my lawyer? 
 
MR. BAKER: Yes. 
 
(Discussion held between the witness and counsel outside the 
hearing of the reporter.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: I will show you the color photo, too, Mr. Simpson. What are 
you pointing to, Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. BAKER: I was pointing to the numbers. It appears--because 
it's such a poor photo, it appears it's off a video. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Is that what it looks like? 
 
MR. BAKER: It does to me. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Probably right. 
 
Q: What is this a picture of, Exhibit 44? 
 
A: Part of my kitchen. 
 
Q: The way it looked in June of 1994? 
 
A: To what degree are you asking me that? 
 
Q: I mean, is that the condition-- 
 
A: That's the configuration, yes. 
 
Q: Where in the kitchen-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You want to elucidate what this is, Mr. 
Blasier? 
 
MR. BLASIER: I think it's a police picture. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Where in this photograph, Mr. Simpson, did you--if you can tell 
by this photograph, were you standing when you noticed the spot 
of blood on your left pinkie? 
 
A: I can't tell by this photograph. 
 
Q: The area is not depicted in this photograph? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And in what direction of the kitchen were You standing? 
 
A: I believe--I could have been at this sink (Indicating), but I'm 
pretty confident I was at this sink over here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Beyond the bottom right-hand corner. Is that right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Where was Kaelin looking for the flashlight? 
 
A: He was inside this cupboard over here (Indicating). 
 
Q: Over there? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Where did you get the paper towel to apply it to the blood on 
your finger? 
 
A: It was over there by the sink (Indicating). 
 
Q: There is another sink in this area here (Indicating)? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BREWER: Can you identify for the record where the witness 
is pointing? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Sure. He is pointing to the area to the right of 
where the picture cuts off. 
 
Q: There appears to be a kitchen table and some chairs? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And to the right of that is a sink area. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Okay. Thank you. Did you, after you came home from the 
recital, go anyplace off of your property in your car other than 
McDonald's? 
 
MR. BAKER: And so I am clear, are you talking about the Bentley 
as contrasted to the Bronco? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Either car. I mean, he said he pulled the 
Bronco out and parked it--  
 
MR. BAKER: Right. And that's off the property. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Not counting that. Q: Did you travel anyplace 
off of the property in one of your cars from the time you got back 
from the recital up until the time you left for McDonald's? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you get in the car to go someplace and then change your 
mind? 
 
A: I was--by the time I got in my car, I had changed my mind.  
 
Q: a mind which car did you get into? 
 
A: The Bentley, I believe it was, but I had changed my mind before 
I got -- I'm sorry. The Bronco, but I changed my mind before I got 
into it. 
 
Q: When you got into the Bronco, it was parked where? 
 
A: On Ashford. 
 
Q: And you got into the Bronco to go where? 
 
A: I had already changed my mind. I got in the Bronco to bring it 
inside my gate. 
 
Q: When you went out to the Bronco, you were contemplating 
going where before you changed your mind? 
 
A: Before I went out to the Bronco, I was contemplating going to 
Paula's. 
 
Q: And what caused you to change your mind? 
 
A: I was a little tired, and I hadn't heard from her, so I just decided 
not to go. 
 
Q: And you didn't go. 
 
A: And I didn't go. 
 
Q: At that moment in time did you call her to see if she was home? 
 
A: I might have, but I don't know. I might have. 
 
Q: Did you tell Detectives Vannatter and Lange that you were 
going to her house? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Was that a true statement? 
 
A: Well, I was going to her house, but I didn't go. 
 
Q: In the sense that you just described? 
 
 A: Yes. 
 
Q: You didn't tell Vannatter and Lange that you called Paula from 
your car? 
 
A: Well, I may have, yes. 
 
Q: Why did you tell them that? 
 
A: Because I was very tired, and the two nights were running into 
one another, for me, Friday night--I'm sorry -- Saturday night and 
Sunday night, and at the time I may have been somewhat confused. 
But obviously there's no phone record in my car at that time calling 
Paula, when obviously Saturday night when I was driving to her 
house, I called her in my car. 
 
Q: Mr. Simpson, is there anything else that you said to Vannatter 
and Lange during that police statement which you now know to be 
incorrect or now believe to be incorrect? 
 
A: I don't know that that was incorrect. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: I'm not sure that that was incorrect. I don't believe that was 
incorrect. 
 
Q: Is there anything that you said to Vannatter and Lange when 
you gave your police statement that you now think is incorrect? 
 
A: I didn't think that was incorrect. 
 
Q: Is there anything that you said to them that you think now is 
incorrect? 
 
A: I would have to read the police report. 
 
Q: Does anything come to your mind? 
 
A: Not immediately. You know, not immediately, no. 
 
MR. BAKER: Do you want him to take the time to read it? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: No. I just want to know whether you, as you sit here today 
testifying, are aware of anything that you said to Vannatter and 
Lange that you since have learned or discovered or believe to have 
been incorrect. 
 
A: I don't think so. When they were talking to me, I was very tired 
and I was just trying to recall--when they were asking me 
questions, I was trying to answer them as honestly as I could, but 
sometimes--like I at one point was confused if I got the flowers 
after the concert, which would have been impossible, but that was 
just a condition of--the condition I was m. 
 
Q: When was the last time you read that statement? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well. . . Yeah, you can answer that. That you 
actually read it, OJ. 
 
THE WITNESS: I may have read it two weeks ago. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Is that the last time you've looked at it? 
 
A: I don't think I read the whole thing. I just looked at it two weeks 
ago. 
 
Q: The last time that you've seen it. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you look at? 
 
A: I don't know. I just-- 
 
MR. BAKER: It's been on the table here. You're excluding that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. 
 
Q: Other than if you have seen it-- well, since the deposition has 
begun, other than maybe seeing it in my possession here or your 
lawyers', have you actually studied it or read it or reviewed it-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: --at all? 
 
A: No. I think I just skimmed over it at that time, but I-- 
 
Q: Two weeks ago? 
 
A: It may have been two weeks ago. It may have been around the 
time I was doing--whenever I was doing the video. 
 
Q: When you skimmed it, did you notice anything that was 
incorrect in it? 
 
A: When you say "incorrect," it was just I was tired then and my 
perceptions on some things I don't think were as clear as I had 
wished, but fortunately, and I guess maybe unfortunately, virtually 
everything that we talked about in that 33 minutes we talked about 
after and before and, of course, they didn't record that. So it was 
whatever questions they had that they weren't clear on was cleared 
up with Vannatter and Lange before and after. 
 
Q: Let's talk about that. You had mentioned that or alluded to that a 
couple days ago. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you say to Vannatter and Lange that's not contained in 
the 33-minute statement? 
 
A: I answered all their questions. Whatever I questions they asked 
me that's not in there, I answered.  
Q: When that statement. the written statement, was-- it was a tape-
recorded statement. Correct? 
 
A: That portion of it was, yes. 
 
Q: And you knew that it was being tape-recorded. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: They told you. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, was there--had the discussion with n Vannatter and Lange 
begun earlier, and then at some point they said, "OJ., we want to 
start taping you?" Is that what happened? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then after the tape went off, did they tell you that they were 
shutting off the tape? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then did the discussion continue? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And how long was the discussion with Vannatter and Lange 
before the tape went on? 
 
A: In the car going downtown, in the room, whatever time that 
was. My concept of time was just not functional that day. 
 
Q: Both Vannatter and Lange were in the car with you going 
downtown? 
 
 A: I don't know if both were in the car with me. It may have been 
just Vannatter. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: Anybody else besides Vannatter and you in the car? 
 
A: If it would have been, it would have been police officers. 
 
Q: When you got --You went directly from Rockingham to the 
police station. Correct. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And then you went to a room-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --with Vannatter? 
 
A: Yes. I believe Vannatter or Lange. At the time I wasn't 
registering who they were. 
 
Q: When you got to the police station, Mr. Simpson, you went 
directly to this room. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: No stops in between. Correct? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: When you got to the room, who was there? 
 
A: They were there and some other guys were coming in and out, I 
gather police officers, and then at one point my lawyers came in, 
and they left the room. 
 
Q: "They" being whom? 
 
 A: Whatever police officers were there. 
 
Q: You don't remember? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Now, did you have a discussion with-- Was Lange in the room, 
too? 
 
A: You know, there were guys coming in and out, so I can't really--
I couldn't register that at this point. 
 
Q: I will get back to that. In the car with Vannatter, was he in the 
back seat with you? 
 
A: I don't think so, but I really don't remember. I don't recall. 
 
Q: You were in the back seat. Right?  
 
A: Yes, I was in the back seat. 
 
Q: He was in the front seat.? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: And he asked you questions about the facts and circumstances 
surrounding Nicole's death? 
 
A: Yes. He was saying, "We got some problems," basically, and he 
was talking. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen any written statement of the discussion you 
had with Vannatter and Lange in the car? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever put down that information in writing? 
 
A: Me? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen any written statement of your discussion 
with Vannatter and Lange in the police department room other than 
what's on the tape? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you ever make a memo of that, write those statements 
down or your thoughts about that? 
 
A: Write them down, no, and the rest I think would be attorney-
client privilege. 
 
Q: "And the rest" meaning what? 
 
A: Whatever conversations I had with my attorneys. 
 
Q: Apart from telling your attorneys what happened there, I just 
want to know if there is a document, a piece of paper, a tape 
recording, a memorandum that sets forth what you say happened in 
these unrecorded portions of your discussions with these two 
police officers. 
 
A: Not that I know of. 
 
Q: Okay. Tell me now what Vannatter asked you and what you 
said in the car. 
 
A: I don't know. He was just talking about some problems, and I 
can't-- I don't--I can't recall specifically in the car, specifically 
after, before and after the tape interview. I mean, in general I do, 
but specifically I can't tell you, but in general I could. 
 
Q: So what you are saying is that right now you can't separate out 
what was said in the car versus what was said before and after the 
tape recording. Is that right? 
 
A: Yeah. My timing, I was kind of in a bad way that morning. 
 
Q: When you got to the police department room, did there come a 
time when you sat down with Vannatter and Lange, and your 
lawyers were out of the room, and it was just the three of you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you began to talk. Right? 
 
A: I was talking whatever they were asking me all the time. 
 
MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. Then he began to talk. I don't-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't mean it that way. Let me withdraw it. 
Q: Then a discussion among the three of you began where they 
were asking you questions. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, when that discussion began is that when the tape went on? 
 
A: The first time, yes. 
 
Q: What do you mean by "the time"? 
 
A: Well, at one point they started the tape, and they said something 
and asked me if I understood it. I said "Yeah, because you guys say 
they can't be in here."   And then they stopped the stopped the tape 
and started, "Oh, come on, OJ., we 're just trying to get this thing 
over with so you can go home and we can do things," and da, da, 
da, da. And I said ''Okay," and they got me a Coke and started all 
over again, and that's what happened. 
 
Q: So what you are saying is that they began to tape you, and then 
the tape stopped and you had this kind of discussion off the tape. 
Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And they got you a Coke-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: --they came back in, and you started up again. Right? 
 
 A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, is the first part of this conversation before they turned off 
the tape, do you know whether that is reflected in the police 
statement? 
 
A: No, it's not. 
 
Q: It's not? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Okay. So tell me, then, what was said during that time, as best 
as you can recall, before the tape was turned off? 
 
A: They were just reading me the rights, and "You have the right to 
have an attorney present" and whatever, and my-- "and you 
understand that?" And I said, "Well, you guys tell me I can have an 
attorney present." And they stopped the tape and started, "Oh, 
come on, OJ. Look, if you want them in here-- we're just trying to 
rush this thing so you can go back home. Can we get you anything. 
Do you want a Coke? Do you want to talk? You don't really have 
to talk. 
I said, "Hey, guys, I'll answer whatever questions you want." They 
got me a Coke, you know, everybody settled down again, and then 
they started over again. 
 
Q: Did you agree to talk with him without your lawyer? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did they say to you, "We want to rush this thing"? 
 
A: Well, they said that, you know, "You look tired. You want to go 
home, I know, and we want to get you out of here," words to that 
effect, yes. 
 
Q: And you were tired. Right? 
 
A: Oh, yes. 
 
Q: And you wanted to go home. Right? 
 
A: I wanted to see my kids. I wanted to go home. I wanted to--I 
don't know what I wanted to do. 
 
Q: So in terms of information that you gave about the case, nothing 
happened in that part of the tape. Is that right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And before they turned on the tape, there wasn't any 
information given out about the case either. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: You mean between the time of the first tape and the 
time the second tape started? Is that what you're saying? Or are you 
saying at any time in that room? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me start over again. 
 
Q: I am trying to find out whether there was information that you 
gave them in answer to their questions about the case, so to speak, 
that's not on this tape. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And so far you've told me that this first Portion, when you guys 
were off the record, wasn't really about the facts of the case. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct, yeah. 
 
Q: So, now, before--after they got you the Coke, they turned the 
tape on and the statement is recorded. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: After that tape went off, they turned it off, what happened next? 
 
A: They talked to me for a while. Then my lawyers came in. Then 
they took me to take blood, and they talked to me all the way there. 
When I was sitting there waiting to take blood, they talked and 
questioned me. Then finally they took me back to my lawyers. 
 
Q: Now, from the time that they turned the tape off until the time 
they delivered you to your lawyers, during that time tell me what 
they asked you and what you said about the case. 
 
A: Well, they--we talked again, because I don't think they asked 
me who I went to McDonald's with on the tape. We had talked 
about all of that before they started the tape. And I'm not sure; you 
can look at the transcript, but I don't believe they really talked to 
me about--they knew that, and that's why they didn't talk about it 
on the tape, because from the interview before that, they talked to 
me about everything that I had done. Then after, they talked to me 
again about my luggage, where was it, continued to talk to me 
about my cut hand and just--as I said, it's hard to --you know, it's 
hard to differentiate because they talked to me about everything, 
and all the-- when I was in jail and I was reading the police report, 
I noticed that in that tape a lot of things weren't in there that we 
discussed. As I said, who I went to McDonald's with I don't believe 
is in there, and they certainly knew that, because we discussed it. 
My luggage, we certainly discussed. Everything. I mean, we talked 
about everything. It's just hard for me to differentiate what was on 
the tape and what was off the tape, because I was trying to be 
helpful and I was answering everything they asked me. At no point 
in time did I say, "I can't answer that" or "Go get a lawyer. I won't 
talk about that." 
 
Q: Before the tape went on the very first time, you said that you 
had told --you had talked to them all about the things they were 
asking you. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you talked to them before the tape went on all about the 
things they were asking you, was there anybody else present? 
 
A: Vannatter, Lange. I think there was another guy coming in and 
out. 
 
Q: Were your lawyers there? 
 
A: Possibly from time to time, because it was just a general 
conversation going on, and possibly. 
 
Q: And who were those lawyers? 
 
A: Leroy Taft and Howard Weitzman. 
 
Q: So Weitzman and Taft heard or participated in part of this 
conversation. 
 
A: Possibly. I'm not sure because when they were there, they were 
talking to them and not so much to me, and when they weren't 
there, they were just talking to me. 
 
Q: But when you were being asked things like about going to 
McDonald's with Kato and your luggage and all these other 
subjects before the tape went on, Taft and Weitzman were there 
part of the time? 
 
A: I'm not sure. Possibly. As I said, things were--you know, if 
they'd be talking to Weitzman or Taft, they'd go here, and then 
they'd talk to me, and people were moving around, and I was just 
not paying attention to what everybody was doing. 
 
Q: Weitzman and Taft during this time period were in a different 
room than you? 
 
A: Once--yeah, They came in and out of the room that I was in, 
yes. 
 
Q: And is it your sense of this that before the tape went on, you 
had in effect told them everything that you knew, what they had 
asked you? 
 
A: I can't say "Everything." I don't know what I knew. I mean, I 
answered the questions what I was doing basically. 
 
Q: They had questioned you pretty completely on what your 
whereabouts were? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what "pretty completely" means. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know "pretty completely. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: They asked you a lot of questions about your whereabouts, 
about your luggage, about McDonald's, all those sorts of issues, 
before the tape went on for the first time. Is that right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And to this day you have never seen a statement of that part of 
the interview. Is that right? 
 
A: No, but I think it's pretty apparent, if you look at the interview, 
that they knew all of those things by the way they asked me the 
question in the interview, because I had already told them that. 
 
Q: And to this day you have never seen a statement of that part of 
the interview. Is that correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: What did you tell the officers off the tape about McDonald's? 
 
A: Told them who I went to McDonald's with and essentially 
everything that's on the tape: Approximately what time we left, and 
whatever's on the tape about McDonald's is what I told them. 
 
Q: What I am asking you, Mr. Simpson, is to tell me, since I don't 
have a document where I can read it, what you said to them. Not 
the description of the subject matters, but what you said. 
 
A: I don't recall two years later my words, what I said. I told them-
-I answered them approximately what time I went to McDonald's. I 
answered them who I went to McDonald's with. 
 
Q: You told them, for example, that you went to McDonald's with 
Kato Kaelin. Is that right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And what time did you tell them that you went to McDonald's? 
 
A: I told them approximately 9:00 o'clock. 
 
Q: And what time did you tell them that you came back from 
McDonald's? 
 
A: I don't know if they asked that question. 
 
Q: Did they ask you where you were before you went to 
McDonald's? 
 
A: I'm sure they did. 
 
Q: What did you tell them? 
 
A: At home. 
 
Q: Did they ask you when you got home after the recital? 
 
A: They possibly could have asked me that, yes. 
 
Q: And what did you tell them. 
 
A: Probably I didn't-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't guess or speculate-- 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, I can't say. 
 
MR. BAKER:--what you probably told them. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: I can't tell you what I probably told them. I'm sorry. Whatever 
time I got home, whatever my recollection was at that time, I told 
them. 
 
Q: Did you tell them that you went out to find Paula Barbieri? 
 
A: I might have told them I was going to see Paula, yes. 
 
Q: Did you tell them that you got in the car and started to go? 
 
A: Possibly I could have told them that, yes. 
 
Q: Did you tell the officers where you were when you came back 
from McDonald's? 
 
A: Whatever they asked me, I told them. 
 
Q: Did they ask you that question? 
 
A: I'm sure they did. 
 
Q: And what did you tell them. 
 
A: "I was at home." 
 
Q: Did they ask you what you were doing at home? 
 
A: No. They kept interrupting me whenever I was speaking and 
would ask me another question, and I would answer. 
 
Q: Did they ask you when you left to go to the airport? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And what did you tell them? 
 
A: I believe approximately 11:00 o'clock. 
 
Q: Did they ask you where you were from 9:00 o'clock to 11:00 
o'clock? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: 10:00 o'clock to 11:00 o'clock? 
 
A: I don't know if they said--asked me that specifically. 
 
Q: Do you remember telling them where you were between 10:00 
and 11:00 o'clock? 
 
A: I remember answering every question they asked me. 
 
Q: What did you tell them about where you were between 10:00 
and 11:00 o'clock on June 12th? 
 
MR. BAKER: I think, first of all, he testified he doesn't remember 
if they asked that question, number one; and, number two, I think 
you asked it at least three or four times. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker, the difficulty here is that he has 
said that he told them all about the case, in effect, before the tape 
recorder went on, and there isn't any document, and I need to find 
out what he said to them. 
 
MR. BAKER: I've given you wide latitude, but I think when you 
have no foundation for it, it goes beyond the pale. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Wide latitude. These are just simple 
questions. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, what I am saying about wide latitude is wide 
latitude to ask it three and four times. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Can you tell me what you told Vannatter and Lange, before the 
tape recorder went on or after the tape recorder went off, where 
you were between 10:00 and 11:00? 
 
A: Whatever they asked me, I told them. Whatever they asked me, 
I told them. I recall that, yes. 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: I don't recall-- 
 
MR. BAKER: If you have a recollection, tell him. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't recall specifically what they asked me. I 
do know that the subject matters were who did I go to McDonald's 
with. I told them that. The subject matters were, you know, 
approximately what time I got home from the recital. The subject 
matters were my luggage. All of those things they asked me, and I 
don't see them on their police report. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: That's why I am asking you to tell me. 
 
A: Tell you what? 
 
Q: What you said, because-- 
 
A: I told them I went to McDonald's at approximately 9:00 o'clock. 
I told them I got home after the recital. They could check. 
Whatever time it was over. And I don't recall today if I knew, if I 
was clear to them that it was 7:00 o'clock, but probably I told them 
it was around 7:00 o'clock. I told them what luggage I took to 
Chicago. I told them what luggage I brought back from Chicago. 
All of those questions they asked, I answered, and many of them I 
don't see on their police report, so--and I don't think--they're 17 and 
20 year detectives, so I think it's obvious they asked those 
questions, and I answered them. 
 
Q: What I want to know is what answers you gave. 
 
A: To what? Ask me the question like they asked me, and I'll give 
you an answer. 
 
Q: Where were you between 10:00 and 11:00? 
 
A: I don't know if they asked me that question. I was home. 
 
Q: If they did ask you, what did you say? 
 
A: I don't recall if they asked me, so I don't know what I said. Why 
don't you ask me? 
 
Q: I just did. Where-- 
 
A: Why don't you ask me? 
 
MR. BAKER: Time out. We are going to take a break right here. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You know-- 
 
MR. BAKER: We are going to take a break right here. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think it's appropriate to take a break, 
because we are in the middle of an examination, Mr. Baker, but I 
see that I can't stop you. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:34. 
 
(Recess.) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 10:54. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: We have had a somewhat lengthy 
break. I was questioning you about what you said to Vannatter and 
Lange that was not recorded on the tape, and I want to go back to 
that. Tell me what you told them where you were between 10:00 
and 11:00 on June 12. 
 
A: I don't recall. I do not recall them specifically asking me that. I 
can't recall what my specific answer would have been to them then. 
 
Q: Do you recall them generally asking you that? 
 
A: I just recall that everything that they asked me, I answered them 
as truthfully as I could. 
 
Q: And what I want to know is what you said to them, so I have a 
record of it. 
 
A: I just can't recall now exactly what I told them, but whatever 
they asked me, I answered them. 
 
Q: Do you know anything that would refresh your recollection as 
to what you said? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did you tell them about the cuts on your hand? 
 
A: I told-- 
 
MR. BAKER: What do you mean, "cuts" on his hand? There is no 
evidence of cuts on his hand on the 13th. There is evidence of a 
cut. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: First of all, he said cuts on his hand before, 
but I won't trouble--waste time here. 
 
MR. BAKER: All right. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: What did you tell them about the cuts on your hand or cut on 
your hand? 
 
A: That I cut my hand in Chicago. 
 
Q: What else did you tell them?  
 
A: That I saw some blood before I left, and once again this is may 
have, but I assumed I had cut my hand then. 
 
Q: What did you tell them about how you cut your hand before you 
went to Chicago? 
 
A: I don't think I told them anything because I don't know how. 
 
Q: And you told them you didn't know how you cut it? 
 
A: I told them I saw blood, and I didn't have any specific memory 
of cutting my hand, and I never saw a cut. 
 
Q: Did you tell them that you saw the blood coming from some 
particular part of your hand? 
 
A: I can only assume that I did, yes. 
 
Q: What did you tell them? 
 
A: I don't know specifically here, two years later, what I told them 
specifically, no. 
 
Q: What did you tell them what time it was when you saw the 
blood? 
 
A: I don't recall if I did or didn't tell them that. I don't recall that. 
 
Q: What did you tell them about where blood was dropped in, your 
house, anywhere, in your house? 
 
A: I really don't recall the specifics of that conversation here nearly 
two years later. I just don't recall the specifics of those 
conversations, but I do know in general those are things that we 
talked about during the tape and not during the tape, yes. 
 
Q: Did you ask them to record these portions of the discussion you 
were having off the tape? 
 
A: I didn't ask them to do anything but tell me what had happened 
to Nicole and let me go home. 
 
Q: Did they tell you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you had no idea? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Did you tell them that you had more than one cut on your hand? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did you point out where on your finger you had cut yourself 
before going to Chicago? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you point out on your hand or finger where the blood was 
before you went to Chicago? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: Did they say to you, "We found blood on your driveway? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did they ask you if you had bled on the driveway? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: What did you tell them? 
 
A: I don't recall. As I say, possibly they asked me, but I don't recall 
here, two years later, if we had a conversation about that. 
 
Q: Did you tell them that you were positive that the blood they 
found on your driveway was not your blood? 
 
A: I don't recall getting into that conversation with them. 
 
Q: Did you believe at the time that it was not your blood? 
 
A: I had--I never thought about it at the time. I didn't think 
anything about it at that time. Not concerning me, anyway. 
 
Q: Did they tell you that they found blood in your Bronco? 
 
A: I don't think so. 
 
Q: Did they tell you that they found blood in your house? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did they tell you-- 
 
A: They may have. They may have, but I don't believe so. 
 
Q: And on that subject what did you say to them? 
 
A: It wasn't a question, I don't believe. I don't believe it was any 
question of me. 
 
Q: You don't believe they said that? 
 
A: Say that and--you know, they could have said it. I don't know. 
 
Q: "What did you say to them when they said, "There's blood in 
your house. We found blood in your house "? 
 
A: I don't recall, but if they said that, I don't know what I would 
have said. There's nothing for me to say. If they're telling me 
things, they weren't asking me a question. 
 
Q: Were you shocked to hear that there was blood in your house 
and on your driveway? 
 
A: I don't know if I heard if they said that. I don't know if I heard 
that. I was in shock that Nicole was murdered. I don't think any of 
the rest of this would have shocked me. 
 
Q: That there was blood in your house and your property? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, I think you're asking for speculation now. 
He's answered that, and I am going to instruct him not to answer it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am trying to get to his state of mind at the 
time so we can see his thinking and what he said. 
 
MR. BAKER: Regardless, don't-- 
 
THE WITNESS: State of mind-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer the question. He will reask the 
question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, I will reask. Q: Did they tell you that 
there was blood at Bundy? 
 
A: I don't think we talked about blood at Bundy. We may have, but 
I don't recall. 
 
Q: What did you tell them about your luggage? 
 
A: I told them where it was when they asked me where it was. 
 
Q: Where was it? 
 
A: My bag that was with me was there. I thought that the other bag 
was at the gate because I wasn't aware at the time that they 
wouldn't let Cathy on the property with it, and I told them I didn't 
know where my golf clubs were because I didn't wait to take them 
on the plane with me. 
 
Q: What other bag was at the gate? 
 
A: My Louis Vuitton bag. 
 
Q: And that's what you told them? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you said you didn't know where your golf clubs were? 
 
A: Yeah. I didn't think they -- I didn't know if they made the flight 
or not. 
 
Q: Did they ask you off the tape what all the luggage was that you 
took to Chicago? 
 
A: No, I don't believe so. 
 
Q: They just asked you where your luggage was. Right? 
 
A: Yes. I believe it was Lange that said, -Boy, that's all the luggage 
you had?" Because I only had the bag on me, and I told him "No." 
 
Q: You said the Louis Vuitton was at the gate, and you didn't know 
where your clubs were. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What about that other piece of luggage? You didn't mention it 
to them?  
 
A: What other piece of luggage? 
 
Q: That bluish bag that had the wind-breaker and the Maxfli l00s? 
 
A: Yeah, I don't think I viewed that as a I piece of luggage. It was 
like my golf bag. Everything that was in my golf bag was in my 
golf bag. To me that wasn't a piece of luggage. Just like my 
overnight kit is in a separate bag. I don't view that as a separate 
piece of luggage. 
 
Q: Did they ask you what clothing you were wearing before you 
went to Chicago? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you tell them? 
 
A: Whatever I was wearing. 
 
Q: What was that that you said to them? 
 
 A: I don't recall the specific words. I actually showed Lange what 
I was wearing. 
 
Q: There at the police station? 
 
A: No. Once we got back to my house. 
 
Q: You had more conversations your house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That evening? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you--just so I understand the sequence here, Mr. 
Simpson, when you left the police station, you went back to your 
office. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were not with Lange and Vannatter at your office. 
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Then you went back when they said you could go back to your 
house at Rockingham. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And when you went back to Rockingham, the police were there 
still? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Lange and Vannatter? 
 
A: Certainly Lange. I don't totally recall if Vannatter was there or 
not. 
 
Q: And you had a conversation alone with Tom Lange in your 
house-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: --about clothing. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You were not alone? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Who was with you? 
 
A: Skip Taft and Bob Kardashian. 
 
Q: All the time that you talked to Lange at your house on 
Rockingham was in the presence of Taft and Kardashian? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Back to the police station. What did you tell them about your 
best judgment about what caused the blood to be on your hand 
before you went to Chicago? 
 
A: I told them I didn't know. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: I told them I didn't know. 
 
Q: That's what you said: You didn't know? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Between then and today have you given some thought to what 
caused that blood to be on your finger? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you still don't know. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Did they ask you about knives off the tape? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did you tell them anything about knives? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: Did they ask you about guns? 
 
A: I think I may have brought it up, and then they asked me about 
it, yes. 
 
Q: What did you tell them? 
 
A: I don't recall. If you let me read the police station statement, I'll 
tell you. 
 
Q: I am only talking about off the tape now. 
 
A: I don't know if we talked about it off the tape. 
 
MR. BAKER: It was hard to tell whether you were talking about 
on or off the tape. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: All of these questions concern your 
comment earlier this morning that there was all this discussion off 
the tape, and I am just trying to get what it is. So I am not talking 
about what's on the tape now. 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: Did they ask you about Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And your relationship with Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did they ask when you last saw her? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And what did you tell the? 
 
A: Well, as of--well, at the recital. 
 
Q: Did they ask whether you spoke to Nicole? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did they ask when you last spoke to her? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: If you had any telephone calls after the recital? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did they ask you if you were angry toward her? 
 
A: Possibly. 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did they ask you whether there was any conflict between the 
two of you at that point in your lives? 
 
A: I don't know. When I say, -I don't know, you know, I know 
certain things they asked on the tape, and I can't recall if they asked 
me also off the tape. So you're telling me you're talking about off 
the tape. 
 
Q: Off the tape, right. 
 
A: That's what I've been doing, yes. 
 
Q: You are trying your best to tell me what was discussed off the 
tape. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And on the subject of Nicole, you don't remember if they asked 
you about your relationship with her. Is that right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Can you tell me anything else that you and Lange and Vannatter 
discussed off the tape before you got to your house at Rockingham 
that night? 
 
A: I can't recall right now, no. 
 
Q: Now, at the Rockingham property, you said you were talking 
with Lange, Taft and Kardashian, and you said something about 
you showed Lange the clothing you had worn the night before. Is 
that right? 
 
A: He asked. 
 
Q: He asked you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you say? 
 A: I took him to it and showed him.  
 
Q: Where did you take him?  
A: My closet. 
 
Q: And what did you show him in your closet? 
 
A: Whatever I was wearing. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: Basically what I was wearing. 
 
Q: What did you pull out and show him? 
 
A: I showed him some black pants; I showed him a sweater; I 
showed him --I didn't know which Polo shirt because I got a lot of 
white ones, a golf shirt; I showed him the blue pants that were 
laying in the bathroom; I showed him the shoes, and I showed him 
a coat. 
 
Q: Coat?  
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, the black pants you showed him because you had worn 
that to where? 
 
A: The recital. 
 
Q: And the coat, the recital? 
 
A: No. To McDonald's. 
 
Q: You wore a coat to McDonald's? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What coat did you wear? 
 
A: Just a jacket. 
 
Q: Now, you were dressed when you went to McDonald's in the 
golf pants and the golf shirt? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: White socks and Reeboks. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you also put on a coat? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That you got from your house? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And when you went--came back from McDonald's and went 
into the house, did you take your coat with you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The shoes that you showed Lange were what shoes? 
 
A: Reeboks. 
 
Q: The ones you had worn McDonald's? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The sweater that you showed Lange was what sweater? 
 
A: Maybe just a black sweater I have. 
 
Q: That you wore to the recital? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the blue pants you showed Lange were what pants? 
 
A: Golf pants. 
 
Q: That you were wearing when you went to McDonald's? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The Polo shirt that you showed Lange was what shirt? 
 
A: It was just a golf shirt, the one--I believe I showed him the one--
I believe it was--I can't recall right now if it was a Polo shirt I wore 
or a golf shirt that I wore underneath my sweater at the recital or 
not. I just don't recall. 
 
Q: And you said another--identified in your list a golf shirt. Is that-
- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: -the same shirt or different shirt? 
 
A: It could have been the same shirt. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: The shirt you were wearing that evening when you went to 
McDonald's? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you show him any black socks? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have any other discussion with Lange then other than 
looking at these clothing and showing it to him? 
 
MR. BAKER: Now, are we talking just about the clothing and just 
while he was in the closet? Because I'm not sure what your 
question encompasses. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'll withdraw it.  
Q: I want to know what else you discussed with Lange at your 
house other than what you just said to me. 
 
A: At that time, that the police were honest because they didn't take 
my money. That the searchers obviously were honest; they didn't 
take my money. 
 
Q: Did you say anything else? 
 
A: I don't--I can't recall. 
 
Q: Did he ask you any other questions? 
 
A: He asked me if he could take the Reeboks. 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: Sure. 
 
Q: Did he ask you anything else? 
 
A: Not that I can recall. 
 
Q: Now, did you have any other discussions with Lange or 
Vannatter that day other than what you've already told me? 
 
A: Not that I can recall right now, no. 
 
Q: And what about the rest of the week? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: So have you now told me everything that you can recall telling 
Lange and Vannatter off the tape? 
 
A: Everything I can recall, yes. 
 
Q: Did you ask--When was the first time that day you encountered, 
the 13th- Lange or Vannatter? 
 
A: Right after I got to my residence. 
 
Q: And who did you encounter? 
 
A: I believe it was Vannatter. 
 
Q: And that was what time? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: That was the 13th. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In the afternoon. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: You don't know, tell him you don't know. Don't 
shake your head like you don't know and then answer "Yes." 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
MR. BAKER: Okay. Fair enough. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: You shouldn't just mimic what your lawyer says, too. You 
should simply say what you know. 
 
MR. BAKER: Obviously, but the verbal response and what he had 
indicated in his non-verbal communication were different; that's 
all. And he in answer either way. Whatever his recollection is fine 
with me. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: When you talked to Vannatter at the time, did you ask him the 
details of how Nicole had died? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you ask him? 
 
A: I said, "What happened?" 
 
Q: What did he say? 
 
A: "We don't know. We're trying to find out." 
 
Q: Is that all he told you? 
 
A: Well, I asked numerous times during the course of that day, and 
their answers was always the same thing. 
 
Q: And did you ask Lange the same thing? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You asked both of them numerous times, and they said they 
were trying to find out? 
 
A: "Trying to find out, OJ. We don't know. We're trying to find 
out." 
 
Q: When you pulled the Bronco in to take out the golf clubs and 
pack them up, pulled it in from Ashford, as you said, did you then 
immediately pull it out and park it?  
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Before you actually packed the clubs into the cover bag? 
 
A: That may not be correct. I'm pretty sure I probably packed the 
clubs before I pulled the car out. 
 
Q: And then you went out to the Bronco and then parked it? 
 
A: At one point, yes. 
 
Q: How long after you finished packing the clubs did you park the 
Bronco? 
 
A: It could have been immediately. It could have been a few 
minutes. I really don't know. I don't recall. 
 
Q: Do you know what time it was? 
 
A: Somewhere between 7:00 and 9:00. 
 
Q: It was before you went to McDonald's. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: And when you parked it before you went to McDonald's, you 
parked it on Rockingham-- 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: --where we saw in the picture. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Didn't you tell Vannatter and Lange that you were having weird 
thoughts about Nicole? 
 
A: At that time, no, I don't think so. 
 
Q: At what time? 
 
A: At that time I don't believe I said that to them. 
 
Q: When you were talking to them in the police station on the tape 
or off the tape, did you tell them that you were having weird 
thoughts about Nicole? 
 
A: No. I think-I may have said something to that effect in 
answering a question that they asked me, yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I would prefer that you not-- 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't need to look at it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:--show the witness any documents while I am 
questioning him. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't need to look at it. 
 
MR. BAKER: He's entitled if he needs it to refresh his 
recollection. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If he needs it, we'll find out. 
 
Q: You said, "I may have said something to that effect in 
answering a question that they asked me, yes."  
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Tell me what you said. 
 
A: I don't know specifically. If you want me to read it, I'll read it 
and tell you specifically, but I don't have any recollection 
specifically what I said right now. 
 
Q: Can you recall at all what you said? 
 
A: No. I know it was in--I believe it was in relation to maybe 
taking a lie detector test. I'm not sure. 
 
Q: What did you mean by "weird thoughts?" 
 
A: Well, I'd been married for 17 years, and from time to time in 
those 17 years you have thoughts. 
 
Q: What kind of thoughts did you mean when you told them that 
you had had weird thoughts about Nicole? 
 
A: I don't know at that particular time if there was anything 
specific in my head, but from time to time you do have thoughts, 
yes. 
 
Q: Now, one of those weird thoughts that you had in mind when 
you said that to Vannatter and Lange was the thought of killing 
Nicole. Right? 
 
A: No, that's not correct. 
 
Q: Well, what you meant when you were telling them about weird 
thoughts was that sometimes, you know, you felt so angry at her 
that you felt like killing her. Isn't that right? 
 
A: No, that's not correct. 
 
Q: They told you--they asked you --I think you just testified that 
this topic came up in the context of a question about a lie detector 
or polygraph? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: And your point in telling them that you were having weird 
thoughts was that the weird thoughts might somehow come out in 
the lie detector test. 
 
Q: Right? 
 
A: No. My point was I didn't understand a lie detector test and I 
didn't understand what they go after in a lie detector test, and once 
I had a better l understanding, which I did, I would be happy to do 
one. 
 
Q: Did you do one? 
 
A: We offered one. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: We offered it to the prosecution, yes. 
 
Q: To whom? 
 
A: To the prosecution office. I guess Marcia Clark and Gil 
Garcetti. 
 
Q: You personally did or your lawyers did? 
 
A: My lawyer did. 
 
Q: When did they do that? 
 
A: Oh, I imagine a day or so after that Monday. But that week, I'm 
sure it was. 
 
Q: And what did they say? 
 
A: They declined. 
 
Q: You didn't take a test on the 13th. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you didn't want to then. Correct? 
 
A: I had to talk to my lawyers about it. And then they didn't want 
me to either. 
 
Q: You were concerned that these weird thoughts that you might 
have --Strike that.  You were concerned that the weird thoughts 
that you have had about Nicole might somehow affect your 
polygraph test. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And for that reason you were not comfortable with taking it at 
that time. Correct? 
 
A: For that reason I wanted to understand what polygraph test 
meant and the mechanics of a lie detector test, yes. 
 
Q: Because you wanted to make sure that the weird thoughts didn't 
unfairly come out in the test results. Right? 
 
A: If done fairly, I felt obviously it would be no problem, but I 
didn't at that time understand the polygraph test. 
 
Q: Now, did you offer or agree to take a polygraph test about 
whether or not you killed Ron Goldman? 
 
A: They didn't ask me. They just asked me, would I take a 
polygraph test. I don't think they were individualizing either one. 
 
Q: You never had had any weird thoughts about Ron Goldman. 
Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You never knew Ron Goldman. Right? 
 
A: And I didn't know of him or about him at that time, no. 
 
Q: So there would have been no problem in your thinking in terms 
of taking a lie detector test concerning the death of Mr. Goldman. 
Is that right? 
 
MR. BAKER: That's argumentative. Don't answer that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's not a proper instruction, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that, Mr. Simpson. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Argumentative is not appropriate grounds to 
instruct him, in any event. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, you can reframe your question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  
Q: Didn't you say, "Look, you know, I'm not clear in my mind 
about these weird thoughts and whether they'll influence the lie 
detector test on Nicole, but since I could not conceivably have had 
any weird thoughts about Ron Goldman, I am happy to take the 
test about Ron Goldman?" Did you say that to him. 
 
MR. BAKER: It is, A, compound and, B, there is no foundation for 
that at all. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: You can answer it. 
 
MR. BAKER: No, don't answer it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Now, these weird thoughts that you had had about Nicole, they 
were weird thoughts about violence. Correct? 
 
A: In a sense, one, yes. 
 
Q: One what? 
 
A: One thing that came to mind, yes. 
 
Q: One thing that came to mind was violence. What was that? 
 
A: I kinda at one point thought it would have been nice if Michelle, 
when Nicole punched her, who was my housekeeper, if Michelle 
would have punched her back. 
 
Q: Is that the only thought of violence that came up when you said 
you were having weird thoughts about Nicole? 
 
A: Yeah, that was one of them, yes. 
 
Q: What were the other weird thoughts that you had about Nicole 
concerning violence? 
 
A: I don't know if it was violence. Something happened in January, 
and I at one point thought it might have done her some good if she 
would have been injured during this incident, or caught. 
 
Q: That you thought it might have been good if Nicole had been 
injured? 
 
A: Injured or caught, yes. 
 
Q: Caught. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Now, what I want to know about is what weird thoughts you 
had in mind when you told the detectives on June 13 about 
violence by you against about Nicole. 
 
A: I don't think I had any weird thoughts about violence by me 
towards Nicole. That was not what was on my mind at that time. 
 
Q: No thought of violence by you toward Nicole came up in your 
thinking when you made that comment? 
 
A: Yes, that's correct. 
 
Q: Is that your testimony? 
 
A: That's correct, yes. 
 
Q: But you did think at that moment in time about Nicole hitting 
your maid. Is that right? 
 
A: That was one that came up, but in general. It wasn't nothing 
specific. I just know that in the years that I was with Nicole, that, 
you know, sometimes you have thoughts, and that was one that 
came directly to mind at that time. 
 
Q: The first and most prominent thought that came to mind was 
Nicole striking Michelle, your housekeeper. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What other thoughts came to mind, weird thoughts towards 
Nicole? 
 
A: I don't think I really gave it much thought after that. It was just I 
wanted to understand what a polygraph was, and that was one 
thing that came to mind, yes. 
 
Q: But the question--or the purpose of your meeting there with the 
detectives was the killing of Nicole. Right. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did Nicole striking your housekeeper have to do with that, 
in your thinking? 
 
A: The purpose of the question they asked was me doing a 
polygraph test, and I wanted to understand what a polygraph test 
was, and once it was j81 explained to me, I was more than willing 
to take one. 
 
Q: But how could some incident involving Michelle and Nicole 
could possibly have influenced your taking a polygraph test on 
whether you killed Nicole, in your thinking? 
 
A: Well, I didn't think that's totally what they wanted me to take a 
polygraph for at that time. They were just talking about a 
polygraph test at that time. I wasn't at that point in time 
differentiating anything. I wanted to understand what it was. Once 
it was explained to me, we offered something to the prosecution. 
They didn't accept it at the time. 
 
Q: But you knew, when you were talking to Vannatter and Lange 
and you made the comment about you had weird thoughts about 
Nicole, that the whole purpose of this discussion was about the 
killing of Nicole. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You weren't there to talk about-they didn't question you about 
Nicole and Michelle. Correct? 
 
A: I don't believe so. 
 
Q: This was all about Nicole's death the day before. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you said you had had weird thoughts about her. Correct? 
 
A: No, you're not characterizing it correctly. They started talking to 
me about taking a polygraph test. I didn't 't understand what a 
polygraph test was all about. I wanted to understand what X was 
about. And once I understood what it was about, I was more than 
willing to take one, and they refused. 
 
Q: You've said that several times. 
 
A: And I'll say it again. 
 
Q: What I am focusing on in these questions is solely your 
comment to them about having weird thoughts about Nicole in the 
context of that question to you about a polygraph test. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What weird thoughts did you have about Nicole? 
 
MR. BAKER: It's asked and answered. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He told me so far about Nicole striking his 
maid. I want to know-- 
 
MR. BAKER: He also told-- 
 
THE WITNESS: About Nicole striking a human being, a person. I 
don't look of them as maids. As a person, she struck a small 
woman in my house. I thought it was wrong, and at the time I had 
thoughts that I had wished the lady would hit her back. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Is what you're saying is that you thought the maid had killed 
Nicole? 
 
MR. BAKER: Oh, come on. Don't answer that. 
 
THE WITNESS: That's ridiculous. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Why is that ridiculous? 
 
A: Because I think it is ridiculous. I don't think--this person is such 
a kind person--that this person could harm anybody. I don't think 
this person could be physical with anybody, and I don't think this 
person should have been subjected to being punched in her face in 
my house. 
 
Q: That's a despicable act, isn't it? 
 
A: Yes, it was. 
 
Q: Something you would never do. Correct? 
 
A: I would not do that, yes. 
 
Q: Never did. Correct? 
 
A: Never punched anyone, other than when I was a teenager, in 
their face, yes. 
 
Q: Never struck anyone in their face. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you never hurt your wife either. Correct? 
 
A: No. I hurt my wife, yes. 
 
Q: You never struck her with your hands. Correct? 
 
A: I never punched her, yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever strike her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever hurt her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever physically hurt her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever bruise her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever make her black and blue? 
 
A: Yes, I saw her bruised, and I felt responsible for those bruises. 
If it came from me or w if it came from when she fell outside, in 
any event, I was responsible for it. 
 
Q: l didn't ask whether you saw her bruised. I said, did you hit her 
to bruise her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you cause bruises on her body through acts of violence by 
you towards her? 
 
A: I believe the bruises that were on her body, I was responsible 
for. If she got them from me being physical with her or if she got 
them when she fell when she was outside, I was responsible for it. 
 
Q: If she fell when she was outside, it's because you made her fall. 
Right. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Because you were hitting her. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You were pounding her. 
 
A: No, that's incorrect. 
 
Q: You made her face black and blue, didn't you? 
 
A: If her face was black and blue the next day or two days later, I 
was responsible for it. No matter how it happened that day, I was 
the person responsible for it. 
 
Q: And you cut her lip, didn't you? 
 
A: That's incorrect. 
 
Q: You hit her with your fist, and you caused her lip to split open. 
Is that right? 
 
A: That's incorrect. 
 
Q: And you caused scars on her face didn't you? 
 
 A: That's incorrect. 
 
Q: Black-and-blue marks on her face. Right? 
 
A: Yes, that's correct. 
 
Q: And that was the result of your hands touching her violently. 
Correct? 
 
A: Touching her violently? 
 
Q: Yes. Hitting her. 
 
A: That's incorrect. 
 
Q: How is that incorrect? 
 
A: I didn't hit her. 
 
Q: What did you do to her? 
 
A: I rassled her. 
 
Q: What does that mean? 
 
A: That means I had my hands on her, and I was trying to force her 
out of my bedroom. We rassled, and I was responsible for 
whatever happened. 
 
I know she was outside. She fell when she was outside. I wasn't 
outside at the time she fell, but there was a witness to that. The 
state of mind that she was in when she was outside and she fell, I 
felt responsible for that. So if it happened then, I'm responsible for 
it. 
 
Q: I am not asking you about the moral or other responsibility. I'm 
asking for what happened. Okay? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You had your fingers around her throat. Correct? 
 
A: I could have touched her neck, yes. 
 
Q: What do you mean, you could have "touched" her? 
 
A: I could have. 
 
Q: This was a violent episode, wasn't it? 
 
A: Yes, it was. 
 
Q: And you made marks on her throat, didn't you? 
 
A: I didn't see them, but I'm told there were. 
 
Q: Who told you? 
 
A: In court I saw it. 
 
Q: You were in such a rage that you don't remember what you did. 
Is that right? 
 
A: I remember exactly what I did. 
 
Q: You were enraged when you had this act of violence toward 
her, weren't you? 
 
A: I don't know if that's totally true, but I was angry, yes. 
 
Q: Very angry. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Rage is a fair description of your state of mind. Correct? 
 
A: No, that's not. 
 
Q: Not? Anger? 
 
A: Anger. 
 
Q: Intense anger? 
 
A: Anger. 
 
Q: Angry enough to hit her? 
 
MR. BAKER: That's enough. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: I'm not going to let you just continue to batter him 
the rest 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Batter him. That's an appropriate word, Mr. 
Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, you can make your sound bites however you 
like. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: These are not sound bites, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: He is not going to answer that in that tone and--in 
your accusatory tone and leaning forward and in his face. It's not 
going to happen. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The witness doesn't look at me and has not 
looked at me and has not made contact with me throughout this 
deposition. I am trying to-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Has not made contact with you? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Eye contact. He keeps looking down. I prefer 
he look at the camera. 
 
MR. BAKER: He has not made eye contact with you? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I prefer that he look at the camera or me. 
 
 MR. BAKER: I really don't care what you prefer. That's irrelevant 
to me. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, let's not get off the track here. Okay? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You're a very clever guy, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: I am not clever at all. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let me go back to my questions. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: When you say you "rassled" her, you didn't--this wasn't a 
playful rassling match, was it? 
 
A: Not at all. 
 
Q: This was an angry, intense physical confrontation between you 
and Nicole. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you later lied about it publicly, didn't you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you lied in your deposition about it, didn't you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have this episode in mind when you were talking to the 
detectives about having weird thoughts towards Nicole? 
 
A: Not specifically, no. 
 
Q: You mean you thought about her hitting Michelle, your maid, 
but you didn't think about your hitting Nicole. Is that what you're 
saying? 
 
A: I didn't hit Nicole. 
 
Q: Not once. Is that correct? 
 
A: Not once. 
 
Q: But you put your fingers around her throat. Right? 
 
A: I'm sure I touched her throat, yes. I'm sure I touched her, yes. 
 
Q: How did she get those marks on her face? 
 
A: Through the course of our rassling, I'm sure she got those marks 
on her. 
 
Q: Describe the movements you made with your hands on her face 
that caused those bruises that we have seen on the pictures. 
 
A: I can't do that. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because I can't tell you specifically how that was done. 
 
Q: You don't remember the sequence of events? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is that correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That's incorrect? 
 
A: It's correct that once we started rassling, I can't give you a 
sequence of events, yes. 
 
Q: Tell me how your hands made contact with her face. 
 
 A: I don't believe that my hands made contact with her face at one 
point in time in trying to rassle her. I know I had her head, pulling 
her, so it could have happened then. 
 
Q: You were pulling her hair to get her out of the room? 
 
A: No. I had her by the shoulders and the head and was trying to 
pull her off-- 
 
Q: Like in a headlock? 
 
A: Yeah, sort of in a headlock. 
 
Q: Trying to pull her out the room? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you never once raised your fist to her and hit her? 
 
A: No, that's correct. 
 
Q: Did you ever once raise your hand and slap her? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Did you strike her? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Did you see that she was bleeding during this exchange? 
 
A: She never bled once at any time there, at the police station. 
Nobody gave her a Kleenex. Nobody wiped blood off her. There 
was not one drop of blood anywhere on that scene that day or that 
night. 
 
Q: When you were involved in this confrontation with her, did you 
see any marks on her face? 
 
A: No, I didn't. 
 
Q: Did you see any darkening of her skin? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was she screaming? 
 
A: She was yelling at me. 
 
Q: Was she in pain? 
 
A: I couldn't tell if she was in pain or not. 
 
Q: Was she screaming and yelling in pain? 
 
A: No. She was cursing me. 
 
Q: Telling you to stop hitting her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she say that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you to stop what you were doing. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You were physically more powerful than her. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: How much did she weigh at that time? 
 
A: I would say in the area of 135. 
 
Q: And how tall was she? 
 
A: 5-7 1/2, 5-8 
 
Q: What was your height at that time? 
 
A: 6-1 1/2. 
 
Q: What was your weight? 
 
A: 210, 215. 
 
Q: So you were easily able to overpower her physically. Is that 
right? 
 
A: No, that's not correct. 
 
Q: She was a match for you physically? 
 
A: Yes, in that sense, in the way I was trying to remove her, she 
was a match. 
 
Q: Let me show you Exhibit 3 of the trial, Exhibit 4 of the trial, 
Exhibit 10 of the trial and Exhibit 11 of the trial. These are all 
photographs of Nicole. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Do you have copies? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: They're being handed out. 
Q: And Exhibit 5. You have all these photos in front of you. 
Correct? You recognize these photos, don't you?  
 
MR. BLASIER: Are you going to give them exhibit numbers?  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, I will in a minute. Q: You recognize 
them, don't you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: They are photos of Nicole. Right? 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: You have to answer audibly. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And they're photos of Nicole after the--this physical 
confrontation that you had with her. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Every single one of them, all five of them. Right? 
 
A: I'm not sure of that. 
 
Q: Which one are you not sure of? 
 
A: I'm not--this is what's in court. That's the only time I ever saw 
them, so that's what I'm assuming this is. I wasn't there when they 
were taken. 
 
Q: When you last saw Nicole that evening, you saw these marks on 
her face? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: But you know that these marks came from the incident that you 
said you were responsible for. Correct? 
 
A: I'm assuming so, yes. 
 
Q: Do you have any reason to doubt that? 
 
A: Not really. 
 
Q: You caused all those marks on her face that you see in these 
pictures, didn't you?  
 
A: I feel responsible for--some of them may have just been her 
picking her face, but if there's bruises and stuff, I'm certainly 
responsible for them, yes. 
 
Q: How exactly are you responsible? 
 
A: In rassling her to get out of the house or whatever state she was 
in--as I could see here, she's got--she's muddied. I wasn't there at 
that time. She hurt herself at that point in time, I'm responsible for 
it. 
 
Q: How did you by putting her in a headlock cause these marks to 
occur on her face? 
 
A: We were rassling in the room, and I was trying to get her out of 
the room, and as we were rassling to get her out of the room, we 
were falling and rassling to get out of the door, and I'm assuming it 
happened then. 
 
Q: Now, when you were rassling with her, is that also how the 
black and blue bruising on her left --under her left arm came 
about? 
 
A: I can only assume so. 
 
MR. BAKER: Is that the left? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Right. Right. I'm sorry, Mr. Baker. Right 
arm. 
 
THE WITNESS: I can only assume so. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: When you were rassling with her, did you hassle to the floor?  
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: The two of you were on the floor and she was trying to get 
away, and you were holding her in your headlock? 
 
A: She was trying to stay in the room. I was trying to get her out of 
the room. I guess she was trying to get away from my grip, yes. 
 
Q: Before you put her in the grip, did you hit her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Punch her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Strike her in any way? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Before you put her in the grip, in the headlock, did you make 
any contact with her face at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And when you put her in the headlock, is that when you fell to 
the ground? 
 
A: I don't know if I really fell to the ground. I know we were 
rassling around and I was trying to pull her and... 
 
Q: You rassled around. You mean in bed? 
 
A: Well, it started on--I was on the bed and she was off of the bed 
when it started. 
 
Q: Yeah? Well, describe to me, as best as you can recall, the entire 
sequence of events. I am now referring to the evening of January 1, 
1989. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: About what time in the morning. 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: About 4:00? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Tell me what happened. 
 
A: At what point? 
 
Q: Starting with the argument you had in the bed. 
 
A: We didn't really have an argument. She had an argument with 
me, and she went out of the room, and I locked the door. 
 
Q: Out of the bedroom? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was she arguing about with you? 
 
A: Something--that she had mistaken something that--what's her 
name? Who is now Marcus Allen's wife-- 
 
Q: Katherine? 
 
A:--Katherine had said to her, and she was arguing about that, and 
I said "Well, call Katherine. I think you misunderstood what she 
told you. And at this particular point the argument started, and she 
got out of the bed--usually it started in the bed. She got out of the 
bed and went and I guess what she does is pick and clean her face-- 
 
Q: "Pick" her face, what does that mean? 
 
A: I don't know. She does it every night. Women--ask your wife. 
She'll tell you. 
 
Q: Are you telling me that she picked her face such that she caused 
these marks on her face? 
 
A: I don't think-- 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what "these marks" are. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Marks reflected on the photographs, Mr. 
Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, there's a lot of marks on the-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I know there are. Q: Let me ask you this 
question-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Do not answer to "these marks" on the photographs.  
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: When she went into the bathroom after your discussion about 
Katherine --By the way, did that discussion concern the subject of 
your infidelity? 
 
A: Possibly, yes. 
 
Q: You were unfaithful to her, and she was upset about it. Right? 
 
A: No, she was absolutely wrong. It had something to do with 
some earrings. 
 
Q: We will get back to that. But staying with this subject, she went 
into the bathroom and you saw her start to pick her face? 
 
A: At one point, yes. 
 
Q: At one point before she came out of the bathroom you saw her 
picking her face? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: The door was open? 
 
A: There's no door there. 
 
Q: And you could see from your bed. 
 
A: No. I went downstairs and got some water. 
 
Q: And when you went downstairs, you saw her picking her face. 
 
A: Doing what she does every night. Every night. Cleaning her 
face and picking her face. She has sort of a thing about that. 
 
Q: What does "picking her face" mean? 
 
A: I don't know. Getting blackheads out, squeezing pimples, that 
kind of stuff. 
 
Q: When she did this every night, did she walk out of the bathroom 
with marks on her face? 
 
A: Sometimes very apparent marks, yes. 
 
Q: Marks exactly like any of the marks you see on her face in these 
photographs? 
 
A: Sort of like this (Indicating) by her nose, some of these things 
(Indicating) on her chin. Yes, she looked like that quite often after 
she picked her face. 
 
Q: The one to the left of her nose-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --and the ones on her chin. 
 
A: Chin, yes. 
 
MR. BREWER: What trial exhibit? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He is looking at Exhibit No. 10. 
 
Q: You believe that based on what you saw that evening, that that's 
how the mark to the left of her nose and on her chin were caused? 
 
A: I have no belief one way or the other on that. 
 
Q: You see the marks above her left eyebrow? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You think that came about from picking her skin? 
 
A: No. I think that was caused by our confrontation, and I believe 
I'm totally responsible for that. 
 
Q: Did--What happened after you saw her picking her skin? 
 
A: I went and got some water-- 
 
Q: Excuse me. Picking her face. 
 
A: I went and got water, and climbed back in bed. 
 
Q: Did you have any clothing on? 
 
A: I don't think I had on anything, no. 
 
Q: And did she? 
 
A: I'm not sure. 
 
Q: Did she at that time sleep with or without any clothing on? 
 
A: Normally just in her panties. 
 
Q: Now, what happened next then? 
 
A: She was still talking as I was in bed, and I made an effort to call 
Katherine-- 
 
Q: You called Katherine? 
 
A: I was making an effort to call Katherine. I said, "You just come 
and call Katherine," and I was making an effort to call her, and at 
that point she came in the room and kind of came over me and hit 
me. 
 
Q: You were on the phone? 
 
A: No. I was on my bed, leaning over, telling her, arguing with her 
about, "u always make these accusations. Why don't you call her, 
because I know that is not what she meant." 
 
Q: What was the accusation Nicole had made? 
 
A: Something about me buying earrings for a girl. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: No particular girl. 
 
Q: Was it true? 
 
A: No, it wasn't true. 
 
Q: Had you bought earrings? 
 
A: No, I didn't.  
 
Q: Totally untrue? 
 
A: Totally untrue. And I think she just misunderstood what 
Katherine said, and I believe they had a conversation about it and 
straightened it out. Unfortunately, after this. 
 
Q: In the course of your 17-year relationship with Nicole, did you 
believe she was a liar? 
 
A: She lied, yes. 
 
Q: She lied often to you? 
 
A: Not often, no. 
 
Q: Would you call her a pathological liar? 
 
A: No, I wouldn't. 
 
Q: More than not, she was honest with you? 
 
A: Yes. Yes. 
 
Q: And truthful in her relationship with you. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. When she came back, did she strike you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You didn't see her coming? 
 
A: I may have seen her coming. 
 
Q: Where did she hit you? 
 
A: I don't know. She was just--it was 1 just a swing, kind of. I was 
on the bed, and it was just a thing that she did. 
 
Q: Angrily. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she hit you with both hands? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Where on your body? 
 
A: I don't know. She just came, and I reacted at that point. 
 
Q: Now, as a result of--Did she continue to hit you, by the way, 
throughout this confrontation, swing at you and try to hit you? 
 
A: Possibly, but, you know, at that point I was just trying to get her 
out of the room, and she was--Nicole is Nicole. She didn't want to 
be put out of the room. 
 
Q: As a result of this confrontation, did you suffer any injuries? 
 
A: I had a scratch right around here, right around this area of my 
body (Indicating). 
 
Q: Is that the only thing? 
 
A: Only thing I noticed, yes. 
 
Q: And when she started to hit you on the bed--where; on the face 
or on the body? 
 
A: On the body. 
 
Q: Your chest or in the back? Where? 
 
A: I don't know. I was just laying on the bed, and she just came at 
me. It may have been across my arms, because I saw her--I saw the 
motion at me. 
 
Q: What did you do? 
 
A: I grabbed her. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: I don't know. Just grabbed her. 
 
Q: Put both arms around her to try to restrain her? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Both arms around her back? 
 
A: I don't know. She--we rassled somewhat. 
 
Q: I don't know what "rassle " means, so I am trying to get to the 
specifics. 
 
A: Well, I can't describe it to you. We just rassled, you know. If 
you ever saw a rassling match, that's what we were doing. 
 
Q: Did she fall on the bed? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: Was she yelling at you? 
 
A: I don't remember. 
 
Q: What were you saying to her during this time? 
 
A: I don't think I was -- had my hands full, so I don't believe I was 
saying anything to her. 
 
Q: Were you yelling at her, screaming at her? 
 
A: I don't think so. I was just trying to get her out of the room. 
 
Q: Using profanity? 
 
A: I don't think so, but I could have. 
 
Q: Did you tell her to get out of the room? 
 
A: I actually moved her out of the room. 
 
Q: You got her out of the room? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you locked the door? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was that the end of the confrontation? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How did you actually get her from the bed out of the room? 
 
A: I grabbed her and I kind of rassled her and I kind of pulled her. I 
may have at that point had her around her waist sort of, and I 
believe I was behind her at that time, because I didn't have much 
problem getting her out of the room. 
 
Q: How far is the door from the bed? 
 
A: 15 feet. 
 
Q: And you locked the door then? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did her face, by the way, hit anything along the way? 
 
A: I don't know. I couldn't see. 
 
Q: And then what happened next? 
 
A: I locked the door. She evidently went and got a key and came 
back and-- 
 
Q: Where were you when she came back? 
 
A: On the bed. 
 
Q: What were you doing? 
 
A: I don't know. Just thinking about it all, I guess. 
 
Q: What happened when she opened the door? A: I grabbed her 
again. 
 
Q: You heard her fumbling at the lock? 
 
A: No. She got into the room. 
 
Q: And then she came over to the bed? 
 
A: As she walked into the room, was getting off the bed. 
 
Q: And what happened then? 
 
A: I said I didn't want her in the room. 
 
Q: What was she saying to you as she came in the room? 
 
A: I don't really recall. 
 
Q: No memory of that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And then you got up to do what. 
 
A: To tell her to leave the room. 
 
Q: How did you cause her to leave the room? 
 
A: I rassled her again. 
 
Q: Did you fall onto the floor? 
 
A: I can't really recall. 
 
Q: Did you fall on the floor the first time you got her out? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did you just get her out of the room quickly? 
 
A: Not as quickly as the first time. 
 
Q: What happened? A: We rassled. She was forceful. 
 
Q: She was strong? 
 
A: Yes, very strong. 
 
Q: And you just kept her in a headlock and didn't pull-- 
 
A: We rassled. As I said, I wasn't the whole time in the headlock. 
We rassled. She was fighting me off her and I was trying to grab 
her to get her out of the room. 
 
Q: And you are positive that your fists and your hands didn't touch 
her face? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Or her arm. Right? 
 
A: Maybe arm, yes. 
 
Q: When you got her out of the room, you locked the door again? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was that the end of the physical confrontation? 
 
A: Yes. For the most part, yes. 
 
Q: Was that the only time you had a physical confrontation with 
her? 
 
A: Yes. Of this nature, yes. 
 
Q: Of any nature? I mean a fight like that. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Not a romantic-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: This was the only occasions. Is that right? 
 
A: Yeah, a fight like this, yes. 
 
Q: Did you have less intense fights? 
 
A: I wouldn't call them-- 
 
Q: Physical. Physical, confrontations. 
 
MR. BAKER: Physical. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, certainly. Certainly less, yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: How many? 
 
A: We had arguments. 
 
Q: No. I mean physical. 
 
MR. BAKER: He means where you hit her or she hit you or 
something like that.  
 
THE WITNESS: She's hit me on numerous occasions. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: And on numerous occasions when Nicole hit you never hit her 
back. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: So I just want to get this clear. In your entire relationship with 
Nicole --Withdrawn. In your entire relationship with Nicole and 
the entire time that you knew Nicole, you never once hit her with 
your fist. Is that true? 
 
A: Never once did I ever hit her with my fist, ever. 
 
Q: You never once slapped her with your hand? 
 
A: Never once have I ever slapped Nicole. 
 
Q: And never once did you strike her with your hand. 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Never once did you strangle her. 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Never once did you choke her? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Never once did you beat her. 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Never once did you physically hurt her. 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: And if Nicole said you did those things to her, she would not be 
telling the truth. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: She would be lying. 
 
A: Yes. But she would not tell that lie under oath. 
 
Q: She would tell that lie when she's not under oath. Is that what 
you're saying? 
 
A: Possibly, yes. 
 
Q: She would lie to herself even? 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what you mean by that. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know what that means, yes. I'm sorry. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: She would write in her diary that you hit her when it wasn't 
true? 
 
A: She never had a diary? 
 
Q: She would write notes to herself or journal entries about your 
beating her when that didn't occur? 
 
A: Yes, that's correct. 
 
Q: Why would she do such things? 
 
A: Because she wanted me to tear up my prenuptial agreement, and 
I gather her lawyers and her came up with that as a scheme. 
 
Q: So you are saying Nicole would in effect have tried to defraud 
you? 
 
A: Not under oath she wouldn't, because she refused to testify to 
that under oath, which she told me. 
 
Q: So she told you that she made up all these incidents of battery 
by you just for the purpose of voiding your prenuptial agreement 
with her at the behest of her lawyers. 
 
A: Yes. But you must understand, they never used it. She would 
never let them use it. It was sort of a threat, but it never went 
anywhere. 
 
Q: But in carrying out this fraud, you believe that she went so far 
as to write down on paper. 
 
Q: Number of incidents that you believe she made up out of whole 
cloth? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: By the way, were you arrested as a result of this 1989 incident? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did the cops come out? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you left. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You drove away. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: While they were still there. Right? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And you--and they were pursuing you, weren't they? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: They came after you, didn't they? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You didn't tell them you were leaving, though. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Nor did you tell Nicole. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Just like you didn't tell anyone on the 17th when you were 
leaving. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Let me show you this picture. Did we mark this yet? 
 
MR. GELBLUM: We haven't marked any of them. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Anyway, this is Exhibit 9. 
 
Q: Have you ever seen that before? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Ever see it in court? 
 
A: No. Well, I think we may have saw it in court. 
 
Q: Do you see those bruises on her face? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't see anything? 
 
A: No. I mean I see this eye thing. 
 
Q: You don't think this picture reflects any bruising or injuries or 
marks on Nicole's face? 
 
A: No, I don't. 
 
Q: What do you think this reflects? 
 
A: I think it reflects doing a movie that we're doing and we're 
doing makeup. 
 
Q: You have a specific recollection of that? 
 
A: I have a specific recollection of us doing that, yes. I don't know 
if this is the exact-- I didn't take that picture, so I don't know. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: In the late '70s. 
 
Q: In the late '70s you had Nicole made up? 
 
A: No. We were making ourselves up. I think I was doing a movie 
called DETOUR TO TERROR at the time. 
 
Q: And-- 
 
A: And I don't have any specific recollection of this. My--I just 
know what--I just read something. 
 
Q: What did you read? 
 
A: I read where Nicole told Denise Brown that that's what this 
picture was. 
 
Q: Makeup? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where did you read that? 
 
A: In one of the discovery things. 
 
Q: Before you read that, had you ever seen that picture? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you-- 
 
A: I may have. I may have. 
 
Q: Did you remember that you had had this makeup session with 
Nicole? 
 
A: I don't think I had it with her. I think I was doing this thing, and 
we were all supposed to look abused and stuff during this shoot, 
and I was trying to get her a part so she could get her SAG card. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you that she had had this--she had been made up 
to look like an abused, battered woman when that occurred? 
 
A: I don't think so. I think what we were doing was we were just 
doing makeup, doing different make-ups. 
 
Q: But my question is whether she told you after she had this 
makeup put on her that she had that done to her. 
 
A: I saw part of it being done. I don't know if that's specifically one 
time.  We did it more than once. 
 
Q: When you saw it being done, was it she being made up like the 
picture in this exhibit? 
 
A: Things to that effect, yes. 
 
Q: Like in a battered woman. Right? 
 
A: I don't know if this is a battered woman picture-- 
 
Q: Supposed to show marks-- 
 
A: --but I had a puffy eye and everything they did to me, too. 
 
Q: So when you read that thing about Denise, that reminded you 
about that earlier incident? 
 
A: Yes, because I've never seen Nicole look like this before, so--
unless it was before she knew me. 
 
Q: How did Nicole get this mud on her pants on Exhibit 5? Do you 
know? 
 
A: Only from what I saw in police reports. 
 
MR. BLASIER: Could we please give those new exhibit numbers? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes. I will do that. 
 
THE WITNESS: Michelle--I just saw Michelle's testimony on that, 
her police report on that. Evidently Nicole fell when they were 
outside. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: You've read quite a bit of material, haven't you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: He didn't have much to do for 15 months. 
 
THE WITNESS: But I knew that even before, even before. I knew 
she fell even before because she told me about it. We talked about 
it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: How do you account for the finger marks on Nicole's throat, 
Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: I don't. I don't know. I never saw them, so I can't account for 
them.  
 
Q: But you are positive that they're not marks caused by your 
fingers. Is that right? 
 
A: No, I didn't tell you that. I told you that maybe during the 
course of rassling, I could have touched her neck, yes. I'm rassling 
her and I'm holding her. It's pretty tough not to have a person 
around their shoulders and their necks and their bodies. We were 
rassling, and it could have happened, yes. 
 
Q: What could have happened is that you could have had your 
fingers around her throat and caused those marks. Is that what 
you're saying? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, wait a minute. 
 
THE WITNESS: I certainly wasn't choking her. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: I am not asking you if you were choking her. I'm trying to be 
specific without characterizing it. I am saying, what could have 
happened is that you could have had your fingers around her throat, 
and you could have caused the marks that she had on her throat. Is 
that right? 
 
MR. BAKER: And you are depicting a "fingers around the throat" 
as somebody choking and-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not on video. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, but that's Okay.  
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I mean, I don't-- first will you show 
me the marks on her throat? I don't recall ever seeing--and I 
happened to see these pictures in court, unfortunately. I don't ever 
recall seeing that, those marks. No one has ever shown me a 
picture of those marks that you are describing right now. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Well, do you remember putting your fingers on her throat? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And do you remember choking her? 
 
A: No. I know I didn't choke her. 
 
Q: Do you remember causing any marks to be made by your 
fingers-- Excuse me.  Do you remember having your fingers cause 
marks to be left on her neck? 
 
A: Not specifically. I think any marks that's on her, I take full 
responsibility for. I don't know what else you want me to do. I take 
total responsibility 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: --for it. 
 
A: Because I shouldn't have handled the situation the way I did. 
All my life with Nicole, no matter what was going on, I handled it 
without being physical with her, and that time I got physical with 
her. And I'm ashamed of it; I wish it not had happened, and I make 
no excuses for it. 
 
Q: How did you get physical with her? 
 
A: I tried to remove her from the room. 
 
Q: And now you think you should not have tried to do so? 
 
A: Not now. I felt it immediately after then, I should not have done 
so. 
 
Q: This caused a big rift in your relationship with her, didn't it? 
 
A: Yes. I think so, yes. 
 
Q: She was very upset with you as a result of what you did. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were separated for months. Right? 
 
A: That's absolutely wrong. We weren't separated for anything--for 
the two day--that day, and the next day I was home with her, and 
we never separated for more than 48 hours from this incident. 
 
Q: Are you saying that 48 hours after this incident on January 1 
,1989, you were reconciled with Nicole? 6 
 
A: I would say as far as splitting up, 24 hours after this incident we 
had reconciled. In fact, we weren't going to split up, but it was 
painful. It was so much pain, and I had hoped it wouldn't lead 
eventually to a split-up. 
But we didn't live anywhere else. I stayed at a friend's house for a 
few days. I spent the whole day at the house with her, but I just 
felt--I had some anger myself, and I just felt a little distance would 
help. So for about two days I stayed away, and I just hoped it 
wouldn't lead eventually--that this would be, as you call, a rift that 
wouldn't be something that could divide our relationship over a 
period of time, but at that particular time we did not split up. I 
believe we had friends over one week later, and we took a trip 
together within 30 days of this incident. 
 
Q: How much time went by after January 1, 1989 before Nicole 
and you reconciled? 
 
A: What do you mean by "reconciled?" You have to tell me what 
you mean by "reconciled." We never split. 
 
Q: What does "reconcile" mean to you? 
 
A: To me, to the--to me reconciled totally technically is if you split 
up, and then you reconcile when you come back together. 
 
Q: And that never happened. 
 
A: That never happened. 
 
Q: So you never split up, and therefore you never had to reconcile. 
Is that what you're saying? 
 
A: No. I think we had to reconcile what happened that night, for 
both of us. In that sense we needed a rec--- yeah, that's why we 
went to therapy. o We had to reconcile how did our relationship 
reach a point where something like this could happen. Yes. And I 
had to reconcile in my mind how I could let our relationship get to 
the point that I could be physical with her. It was--it was a 
traumatic thing for me. 
But as far as splitting up. she never called a lawyer. I never called a 
lawyer. It was not a situation like that. 
 
Q: What do you mean, she didn't call a lawyer? She prosecuted 
charges against you. 
 
A: No, she didn't. The D.A. did. 
 
Q: But she was the complaining party. Right? 
 
A: That night she was the complaining parry. 
 
Q: And she cooperated. Right? 
 
A: Of course she did.  
 
Q: And in fact you were convicted as a result of entering a plea of-- 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q:-of nolo contendere. 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: You tried to talk her out of pursuing that, didn't you? 
 
A: We talked about that, yes. I asked her, 19 was she going to 
testify in court. She said no. 
 
Q: You were concerned about the damage it would do to your 
public image and your reputation. Correct? 
 
A: Partially, yes. 
 
Q: By the way, you went to therapy because the court ordered you 
to do so. Correct? 
 
A: That's absolutely wrong. 
 
Q: The court ordered you to go to therapy. Right? 
 
A: Six months later. I had been going to therapy for those five or 
six months. Whenever I got to court, I had started therapy 
immediately that week. 
 
Q: Your lawyer told you to do that. Right? 
 
A: No. I wanted to do that even before I saw my lawyer. My 
lawyer--I didn't see my lawyer or speak to my lawyer for a few 
days because he was out of town at that time. 
 
Q: But your lawyer advised you to do that 13 also. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that, OJ. That's nonsense. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Did Ron Shipp have anything to do with this incident? 
 
A: Yes. Not this incident, no. 
 
Q: What did Ron Shipp have-- 
 
A: A few days later he came over, like many of our friends did. 
 
Q: He was a friend. Right.? 
 
A: He was friendly. He was not a guy I invited to do anything. He 
was never at my house for a party unless there was 3 or 400 people 
at the party. I had a party of 50 or a hundred, he was not one of the 
people there. 
 
Q: So he never spent time with you alone. Is that right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Or in small groups of friends. Is that right? 
 
A: That's correct. Unless he showed up at a restaurant-- 0 
 
Q: Uninvited? 
 
A: Well, no. He wasn't invited by me, but I've never invited him to 
dinner ever. 
 
Q: That's what I meant. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now going back, what happened with Shipp a couple days 
later? 
 
A: He came by. 
 
Q: What did he discuss with you? 
 
A: He wanted to discuss what--I don't know if he wanted to discuss 
what was happening. He tried to talk to Nicole. He came in and 
talked to me and he said that he had some expertise in this field. 
 
Q: Field of domestic violence? 
 
A: Yes. And he made some suggestions. 
 
Q: What did he suggest to you? 
 
A: He wanted me to make some public statement. 
 
Q: About? 
 
A: About the incident. 
 
Q: And you said no? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Why? 
 
A: Because I didn't want to. 
 
Q: What else did he tell you? 1 
 
A: I at that point was looking--was saying, "I'm going to have to 
get-Nicole and I are going to have to go to some therapy," and he 
made a suggestion for a person. 
 
Q: Who? 
 
A: Bert Kitaen. 
 
Q: And you went to Bert. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did he suggest anything else to you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You heard some testimony in court about the police coming out 
to your house for domestic violence incidents about seven or eight 
times? Did you hear that testimony? 
 
A: I heard that--I don't know if it was in court, but I certainly heard 
that accusation, yes. 
 
Q: Is that true? 
 
A: Totally false. 
 
Q: How many times did the police come out as a result of incidents 
involving Nicole and you? 
 
A: Will you tell me what incidents? What do you mean by 
"incidents? 
 
Q: As a result of any disagreement, conflict, fight, whatever, 
between Nicole and you. 
 
A: Counting '89, two other times. 
 
Q: Once when? 
 
A: Once in 1993 when we were having an argument at her house 
on Gretna Green. 
 
Q: And the other time? 
 
A: I'm not sure, because I know we didn't call the police, but I'm 
told now it was Mark Fuhrman showed up at our house. 
 
Q: you mean just showed up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Nobody called him? 
 
A: Didn't call the police, no. 
 
Q: How did he get there? 
 
A: I'm assuming Westec called him. 
 
Q: That was the result of a fight that you and Nicole were having? 
 
A: An argument that we were having. An argument that we were 
having. 
 
Q: Who called Westec? 
 
A: Nicole. 
 
Q: Any other times the police come out? 
 
A: No, never any other time, at any other time ever. 
 
Q: Were you arrested in 1985 when the police came out? 
 
A: For what? 
 
Q: For anything. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Were you arrested in 1993 when they came out? 
 
MR. BAKER: When you said, 1985 when the police came out"-- 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't believe 1985 either. 
 
MR. BAKER:--there is no foundation to-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He just mentioned something about Mr. 
Fuhrman, Mr. Baker. 
 
THE WITNESS: But it wasn't 1985. I know that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: What was the year? 
 
A: I don't know, but I know if wasn't 1985. 
 
Q: How do you know that? 
 
A: Because they said it was in the fall and I recall it being in the 
fall because Nicole was pregnant in the fall of 1985, was the first 
year we were married. We never had any arguments that year. 
After she had the baby, she had a C section, so she wouldn't have 
been out, couldn't get her for the next two years to go out having 
drinks with friends, and this incident had taken place after she had 
returned home from having drinks with friends. So certainly--and 
Nicole-- certainly was not the fall of 1985. 
 
Q: Well, based on what you just said can you fix the time for us? 
 
A: I believe it was 1984. 
 
Q: In the fall? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did the police arrest you when they came out in the fall of 
1984? 
 
A: There was no reason for them to be there. They--I think they 
testified to that-- 
 
MR. BAKER: The answer to that was yes or no. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: And did they arrest you in 1993? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: Should we take a lunch break? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Good afternoon, Mr. Simpson. 
 
A: Good afternoon. 
 
Q: Johnnie Cochran was one of your lawyers in the criminal case.  
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were there throughout the trial. 
 
 Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Including the opening statement made by Mr. Cochran. Correct. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
MR. BAKER: Let me just tell you that you are not going to 
examine Mr. Simpson on any comments made by Johnnie 
Cochran. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Let me ask you--let me read something that Mr. Cochran said 
and ask you a few questions about it: "With regard to Rockingham 
Mr. Simpson's residence, again I expect there will be testimony 
that Mr. Simpson did in fact cut his finger at some place where I 
am pointing now near the end of his middle finger, and he so told 
the police that evening, January 13, and that he went out--he did it 
either as he was about to leave or when he went out to the Bronco 
to get his cellular phone." My question to you is: Was that 
statement true? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. We are not -- he is not going to 
be interrogated on what Mr. Cochran said at the trial unless you get 
a court order. That is not evidence in any case, and that is not a 
proper examination, in my opinion. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not asking him for this purpose, Mr. 
Baker, on the 
 
theory that Mr. Cochran's statement is an admission, although I 
may take that position later on. I am simply asking him about the 
statement -- his knowledge about the statement. 
 
MR. BAKER: You have examined him, Mr. Petrocelli, on all of 
that.  You know exactly what his testimony is, and we are not 
going to go into that, not without a court order. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:  Did you tell that to Mr. Cochran? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that either. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Same objections? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, it's the same objection, plus it's obviously 
attorney-client privilege. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, not if Mr. 
 
Cochran said it. 
 
MR. BAKER: Pardon me? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Cochran said this to the jury. 
 
MR. BAKER: I understand that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: And if he got that information from Mr. 
Simpson, how can it be protected by the attorney- client privilege? 
 
MR. BAKER: Because he doesn't have to tell you anything he told 
Mr. Cochran, and that would obviously-- well, I'm not going to go 
into it any further except to say that he does not have to divulge 
any of that, regardless of where Mr. Cochran got that.  That does 
not waive his attorney-client privilege in my opinion, but-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You will instruct him. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: I will instruct him, and we both know our positions 
on this issue. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, just a few more questions. MR. 
BAKER: Sure, go ahead. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Do you know of any person other than yourself who knew that 
you cut your finger--your middle finger on June 12? 
 
MR. BAKER: Other than what he has testified here today about his 
conversations with Vannatter, with Lange, with--  
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No. I am asking a different question, Mr. 
Baker. 
 
Q: I am asking whether you, Mr. Simpson, know of any person or 
source who could--other than yourself, because your attorney has 
barred me about asking about your questions-- your conversations 
with Mr. Cochran, so any person or source other than yourself who 
would know that you in fact cut your finger on June 12, 1994. 
 
MR. BAKER: You can answer that, OJ., although it's been--you've 
interrogated him at length-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: But this is different, Mr. Baker. It's also a 
different finger. 
 
Q: You can answer. 
 
A: I'm sorry. You have to repeat it. 
 
Q: Do you know of any person or source who would know that you 
in fact cut your middle finger on June 12, 1994? 
 
A: Cut my middle finger. 
 
Q: Correct. 
 
MR. BAKER: On the left hand. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: On the left hand. 
 
THE WITNESS: Would know in fact which mean they saw it? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Correct. 
 
MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. 
 
THE WITNESS: On June 12 who saw it? No, I don't know anyone 
who would have saw that on June 12, no. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Do you know of any person other than yourself who would 
know that you cut any of your fingers on June 12, l994? 
 
A: Meaning that they saw it? 
 
Q: Or you told them. 
 
MR. BAKER: He didn't cut his middle finger on June 12, and you 
say "Other than yourself." 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's what Mr. Cochran said. 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't care what Mr. Cochran said. Mr. Cochran 
wasn't under oath, and that's not evidence in the case. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I disagree with that. 
 
MR. BAKER: You think opening statements is evidence in a case? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think it's an authorized admission. But put 
that aside, Mr. Baker-- 
 
MR. BAKER: In a criminal case? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question was not directed to the middle 
finger. It was directed to any finger. In any event. 
 
MR. BAKER: No, it was directed to the left middle finger on the 
12th. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Do you want to read the last question back? 
 
MR. BAKER: Read the question before that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's what I mean. 
 
THE WITNESS: Both questions. You said "middle finger" on both 
times. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No, I didn't. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, you did. 
 
(Question read as follows:  Do you know of any person other than 
yourself who would know that you cut any of your fingers on June 
12, 1994?") 
 
MR. BAKER: Read the one before that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's the one that I want the answer to. He 
already answered the prior question. 
 
MR. BAKER: Read the prior question back. I want to hear it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Let's play it back for Mr. Baker. (Record read 
from 0, Line 16 through 1, Line 5.) 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Read the next question. 
 
(Question read as follows: Q: Do you know of any person other 
than yourself who would know that you cut any of your fingers on 
June 12, 1994?") 
 
MR. BAKER: You can answer that. 
 
THE WITNESS: You mean know as a fact by seeing it? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Seeing it, correct. 
 
A: Seeing it, no. 
 
Q: Or your telling them? 
 
A: Well, I don't know if I'm getting into attorney-client here. 
 
Q: You didn't tell anybody on June 12,1994 - 
 
A: On June 12 I didn't tell anybody anything. 
 
Q: --that you cut your finger, did you? 
 
A: I didn't tell anybody on June 12 anything. 
 
Q: Did you in fact cut your finger on June 12? 
 
A: I don't know. I saw blood on one of my fingers and on my 
counter on June l2th, and I saw blood. 
 
Q: Do you know where Mr. Cochran got the information that you 
in fact cut your finger on June 12th? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Do you know where Mr. Cochran got the information-- I only 
asked him, by the way, if he knew where the source was. 
 
MR. BAKER: I followed your question very carefully. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Do you still instruct him? 
 
MR. BAKER: I still instruct him. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Do you know where Mr. Cochran got the information that you 
in fact cut your finger either as you were about to leave or when 
you went out to the Bronco to get your cellular phone? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Okay. Do you know anybody other than yourself who would 
have known on the evening of June that you cut your finger either 
when you went to leave or when you went out to the Bronco to get 
your phone? 
 
MR. BAKER: He has already answered you about his cuts on June 
12, and don't answer that. That's asked and answered multiple 
times. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Okay. Do you know anyone other than yourself who would 
know that you cut your finger as you were about to leave or when 
you went out to the Bronco to get the phone? 
 
MR. BAKER: Same instruction and same objection. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The question here, Mr. Baker, is directed to 
the latter part, about how the cut occurred. 
 
MR. BAKER: And you've gone into that in excruciating detail 
very, very well, and that's all been asked and answered, and I am 
not going to allow him to answer that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: After Mr. Cochran said this to the jury, did you inform him that 
his statement was false? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that either. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI:

A: Did not occur. 
 
Q: And did you hit her on the street corner? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You were approached by a person who wanted to help, and you

Q: How did you become aware of that, n Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: She told me. 
 
Q: She told you that she had wrote these incidents down? 
 
A: Yes.  I don't know w about those specific I incidents, but she

A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask to see them? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ask her-- 
 
MR. BLASIER: May I have a moment? 
 
(Pause in the proceedings.) 
 
MR. BLASIER: Thank you. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Right? 
 
MR. GROMAN: Is there a pending question? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Is there a pending question? 
 
(Pending question read as follows: Did you ask her--) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Did you ask her for the details of any of the incidents that she 
wrote up? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she actually tell you that she made them up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: All of them? 
 
A: Well, I don't know about all. I don't know what all of them were 
at the time. 
 
Q: Did she tell you how she went about making them up? 
 
A: I don't know if--The question, I don't know if I can answer that 
specifically. 
 
Q: Well, what I am trying to find out is whether she explained to 
you how she invented these I stories. 
 
A: How she invented them? 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: No.  Just why they did them. 
 
Q: You've already said that. Right? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: That was to trump up a charge against you to get out of the 
prenuptial agreement? 
 
A: Those weren't my words, I don't think. 
 
Q: That was the gist of it? 
 
A: Yeah, the gist was to try to get me to tear up my prenuptial 
agreement. 
 
Q: What did your prenuptial agreement have to do with these 
incidents? 
 
A: I guess they wanted more money out of my divorce. 
 
Q: And how would manufacturing incidents help in the divorce? 
 
A: Well, my lawyers didn't think it would happen at all, but I guess 
they were trying to attack my prenuptial based on abuse or 
something or thought I'd be--I don't know what they thought. 
Maybe they thought they could blackmail me into tearing up my 
prenuptial agreement. 
 
Q: Are you referring to an agreement that you had with Nicole 
following the 1989 incident in which you said that if you ever 
willfully physically inflicted injury on her again, that you would 
tear up your prenuptial agreement? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What are you referring to? 
 
A: A prenuptial agreement we signed when we got married. 
 
Q: In what year? 
 
A: 1985. 
 
Q: That's when you got married. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you and Nicole had a prenuptial agreement before the 
marriage? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: She was represented by lawyer? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were also? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who was her lawyer? 
 
A: I don't know. I think it was Clemens. 
 
Q: Bruce Clemens? 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: Who was yours? 
 
A: I think Goldberg. 
 
Q: And Nicole told you that the lawyers told her that if they came 
up with incidents of abuse, they could somehow get out of the 
prenuptial agreement? 
 
A: That wasn't her exact words, no. 
 
Q: But to that effect? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And if they got out of the prenuptial agreement, that she would 
get more money from you? 
 
A: Yes. But those weren't exactly how she said it to me, her words, 
no. 
 
Q: Do you remember how exactly she said it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Tell me. 
 
A: She said that--This is after she had made up her mind she 
wouldn't do it. She said they were trying to get her to say all kinds 
of things, and she wouldn't do it, and they even had a psychologist 
that they tried to make her go to make her hate me," quote, 
unquote, "hate me," and that she was sick of it all. 
 
Q: Who was the psychologist? 
 
A: Susan Ford. 
 
Q: Did Nicole go to her? 
 
A: I don't know, but in the things that I've read since I was in jail, 
yes. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you that she actually went to this psychologist 
and said--told her stories that were not true about abuse? 
 
A: No. She told me that--she said that this lady was trying to make-
- this lady was crazy. I believe she even wrote it down, and I 
believe it's in discovery, that this woman is crazy. "She's trying--
her words to me, "She's trying to make me hate you, and I'm not 
gonna go to her anymore." 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you that she had in fact seen this psychologist at 
least once? 
 
A: I'm not sure if she said at least once. She just said that they had 
her going to this psychologist who was crazy. 
 
Q: Did she tell you that she had told this psychologist fabricated 
stories about abuse? 
 
A: I don't think she got into that about the psychologist. She was 
just telling me in general that that's what they were trying to get 
her to do, and she wouldn't testify to it. 
 
Q: : Did Nicole tell you--Withdrawn. Mr. Simpson, when did you 
first find out from Nicole that she was involved in inventing these 
stories of abuse? 
 
A: Around I believe it was May or June--middle of Mayor June of 
'92. 
 
Q: Now, she filed for divorce in January or February. Do you 
remember the month? 
 
A: I believe February, end of January, early February. 
 
Q: 1992. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the divorce was over in October of 1992. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she said she didn't want to go through with it, and this was 
about May or June. Right? 
 
A: Go through with what? 
 
Q: With the stories of abuse. 
 
A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: And from that point on, do you know whether that effort by her 
to invent these stories was abandoned? 
 
A: Yes. My lawyers never brought it up to e again. 
 
Q: Your lawyers had been bringing it up to you before then? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who were your lawyers? 
 
A: Jerry Goldberg, Skip Aft. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: And Skip Taft. 
 
Q: And Skip Taft? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But the divorce proceedings went on. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: From that point on, did the subject of abuse ever come up in 
your divorce proceedings? 
 
A: Not that I know of 
 
Q: Now, you had--there was a trial that began, did it not? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And it lasted one or two days? 
 
A: Well, I testified and, once again, she wouldn't testify to that, so 
she didn't show up one day. 
 
Q: And that was the end of the trial? 
 
A: She came to my house and we settled, and the trial was just 
about over. 
 
Q: This was about near the end of the trial. Correct? 
 
A: This was virtually the end of the trial, yes. 
 
Q: How long had the trial lasted? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: About a week or so? 
 
 A: I don't think so, but we were in and out of town, so I'm not 
really sure. 
 
Q: When you testified, Mr. Simpson, did you give any testimony 
about the subject of abuse? 
 
A: If they asked me, yes. 
 
Q: And did they? 
 
A: I'm pretty sure they did. 
 
Q: You mean your lawyer? 
 
MR. BAKER: Please don't point at him. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not pointing in an offensive manner.  I'm 
just pointing my pen, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: It's in the eyes of the beholder, Mr. Petrocelli. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: For the record. 
 
Q: In any event, did both lawyers question you about abuse? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Did they ask you whether you had ever engaged in physical 
abuse of Nicole? 
 
A: At this moment I don't recall, but I'm sure there's a record of it. 
 
Q: And what did you say? 
 
A: In what respect? 
 
Q: About whether you had engaged in acts of physical abuse. 
 
A: Since I don't know what the exact questions were or if there 
were questions at all about it, and I'm not clear at this point if there 
were, I can't tell you what my answers would have been. 
 
Q: You had conversations, with Nicole around this time that if she 
testified to such acts of abuse, it would damage your earning 
potential and damage the--her prospects for getting money as well. 
Correct? 
 
A: I personally had no contact--no conversation, with Nicole about 
the divorce. I didn't want to talk about it. I said, "Let the lawyers 
deal with it." 
 
Q: When she came to you and told you that she was inventing 
stories of abuse, you told her that if she went through with those 
stories, that that would damage both of you financially. Correct? 
 
A: That's incorrect. 
 
Q: Did that subject come up at all? 
 
A: No. When she told me is when she had already made up her 
mind not to do it. 
 
Q: you understood there is no-fault divorce, at least at that time. 
Correct? 
 
A: I thought so, yes. 
 
Q: And do you understand how the issue of abuse was relevant to 
your divorce case? 
 
A: You should ask her lawyer. I don't, no. 
 
Q: Did you have any discussion with Nicole at any time after she 
filed for divorce about her not pursuing charges of abuse against 
you in the divorce case? 
 
A: Not at all. 
 
Q: You never tried to discourage her from asserting such claims? 
 
A: She can do whatever she wants to do. 
 
Q: You never tried to discourage her? 
 
A: Exactly. 
 
Q: And never even discussed it? 
 
A: Didn't discuss it. 
 
Q: There did come a time in your marriage to Nicole that you and 
she entered into an agreement that if you ever willfully inflicted 
injury on her again, that the prenuptial agreement would be voided. 
Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And so in making that agreement, you agreed that you had 
inflicted physical injury on her in the past. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. And it wasn't an agreement. It was 
 
something I gave her. She didn't-- she just accepted it. So it was 
just something I offered. 
 
Q: And the reason you offered it is because you felt responsible for 
beating her. Correct? 
 
A: No. I felt responsible for her injuries and--on--in 1989. 
 
Q: Well, you felt responsible for inflicting those injuries. Correct? 
 
A: If felt responsible for those injuries, correct. 
 
Q: Not for inflicting them. Right? 
 
A: Not necessarily that, no. 
 
Q: Did you ever abuse her after that agreement? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she sign that agreement? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: Did she sign it after you sent it to her? 
 
A: She couldn't have signed it before I sent it to her. 
 
Q: Shortly after? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did she wait a long time before signing it? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you whose idea it was to invent stories of abuse 
against you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell your lawyers what Nicole told you? 
 
MR. BAKER: Are you talking about him telling Jerry-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Whether Nicole --Withdrawn. 
 
Q: Did you tell Jerry Goldberg or any other divorce lawyer of 
yours that Nicole told you she had been inventing stories of abuse 
against you? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, I don't think he has to tell you that. That's 
protected by the attorney-client privilege. So don't answer that, Mr. 
Simpson. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You instruct him not to answer? 
 
MR. BAKER: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Did you tell anyone other than your divorce lawyers that Nicole 
had been inventing stories of abuse against you in the divorce 
proceedings? 
 
MR. BAKER: Any lawyers at all, OJ., and then you can answer the 
question. 
 
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry? 
 
MR. BAKER: Did you tell anybody other than your lawyers, 
whether they be divorce lawyers, your criminal lawyers, your civil 
lawyers, any lawyers that you've had, did you tell anybody else? 
You can answer that question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That wasn't my question. 
 
MR. BAKER: I understand that, but we are not going to get into 
whether he told myself-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Skip Taft? Oh, let me make it clear. 
 
Q: At or about the time that Nicole told you that she was inventing 
stories of abuse against you, did you tell anybody other than your 
divorce lawyers? 
 
A: Not that I can recall. 
 
Q: And prior to Nicole's murder, did you I tell anybody other than 
your divorce lawyers that she ; had invented stories of abuse 
against you? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, and you can exclude any other lawyers that 
you told who were representing you at the I time. You can't ask 
him if he told other I lawyers. You can ask him, but he isn't 
required to answer. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I excluded all of you folks and Mr. Cochran 
and so forth. 
 
MR. BAKER: I understand that, but you haven't excluded Skip 
Taft who's a lawyer who's represented him for 25 years, and he is 
entitled to the same attorney-client protection as any other citizen. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't believe that's protected information, 
merely conveying that kind of fact to a lawyer. But put that aside, 
and you've instructed him not to answer, so I will change my 
question. 
 
Q:  Other than lawyers--other than your lawyers, prior to Nicole's 
murder did you tell anyone that Nicole was inventing stories of 
abuse against you? 
 
A: I'm sorry. The first part of that question, I was spaced out. 
 
Q: Okay. I am focusing on a time period before Nicole's murder. 
Did you ever tell anyone other than your lawyers that Nicole had 
invented stories of abuse against you? 
 
A: I can't recall. I can't recall. It seems that I've had the 
conversation, but I just at this time can't recall with who. 
 
Q: Can't recall a single person that you said that to other than 
lawyers. Is that right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you whose idea it was to invent these charges? 
 
MR. BAKER: Asked and answered, but you can answer it again. 
 
THE WITNESS: When she told me, she told me that she wasn't 
going to do this, and I think her words were always 'they. ' 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Meaning the divorce lawyers? 
 
A: That's who I assumed she talking about. 
 
Q: When she said she wasn't going to do this, did she tell you that 
she had gone so far as to write all these incidents down? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever discuss that Nicole had made up these stories with 
the Browns, Louis or Juditha or Denise or any member of the 
Brown family? 
 
A: I may have, yes. 
 
Q: With whom? 
 
A: It would have been Judy, and I don't know if it was concerning 
this or another time, but I'm sure I had a conversation about one 
incident, at least, with Denise. 
 
Q: Relate that conversation that you had with Judy. 
 
A: I don't know. I know Judy and I talked about just about 
everything then, so I can't relate the conversation, any specific 
conversation, but I'm pretty sure that I brought it up with Judy. 
 
Q: The fact that Nicole had been making up these stories? 
 
A: Not that she had been making up these stories. What the 
lawyers were intimating to me. Because I didn't know what was 
going on.  My lawyers informed me. I didn't inform my lawyers. 
 
MR. BAKER: You don't have to talk about what your lawyers 
informed you, OJ 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: I am asking what you and Judy Brown discussed and what you 
told her. 
 
A: We discussed just about everything that was going on at the 
time. 
 
Q: Did you tell her what Nicole had told you about making up 
stories? 
 
A: After Nicole told me? After? I'm not sure. 
 
Q: I told you about this story concerning physical confrontation in 
New York, and you said none of it was true.  Is it true that you 
don't even remember having an argument with her at this 
anniversary party in New York because she was talking to a man in 
a bar? 
 
A: I don't ever recall having an argument with Nicole for talking to 
a man, period. I mean, an argument with her, no. 
 
Q: Did you--do you recall an incident where you beat and kicked 
Nicole and put her in a wine closet? 
 
 A: Never happened.

A: Never happened. 
 
Q: You bruised her leg on that occasion. Do you recall that? 
 
A: Never happened. 
 
Q: Do you recall any argument where Nicole went to a wine closet 
to get away from you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you have a wine closet? 
 
A: Now I do. And I think you could call it a wine closet now, but 
before then I don't think so. 
 
Q: When did you get the wine closet? 
 
A: I don't know. In the '9Os sometime. 
 
Q: Do you recall an incident when Wayne Hughes, your friend, 
spoke to you about your hitting Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall any conversation with Wayne Hughes about your 
hitting Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know whether Nicole ever went to talk to Wayne 
Hughes about being hit. 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q: Whether Wayne observed an injury in the form of a red spot on 
Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't know anything about that? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q: And if Nicole wrote that down that's not true? 
 
A: I don't know what she did with Wayne Hughes, so I can't tell 
you if it's true or not. 
 
Q: But it's not true that you hit her and caused a red spot. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Did you and Nicole ever go to a track meet in San Jose? 
 
MR. BAKER: The only thing I have to say about that is, why? 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I can't recall. 
 
BY MR.  PETROCELLI: 
Q: Did you ever--did you get into an argument with her at a track 
meet or leaving a track meet where you forced her to get out of a 
car? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And left her stranded? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: If Nicole wrote that in some notes, then that's not true. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Do you recall an argument with Nicole at a restaurant called La 
Cantina in 1982? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where Denise Brown was also present? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And do you recall, following that dinner at La Cantina, you 
went home and started throwing Nicole's clothes from her closets? 
 
A: No, not at all. 
 
Q: Smashed framed photos of the Brown family members? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And threw Nicole against the wall? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That's not true? 
 
A: Not true, no. 
 
Q: Do you recall an incident at Rockingham in 1984 or 1985 where 
you smashed 20 to 30 or so framed photographs of the Brown 
family? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is there anything similar to that that occurred? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where Nicole was crying outside of the house because you 
were smashing photographs of members of her family? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No such event occurred? 
 
A: Never happened. 
 
Q:  So if anybody said they saw that, then they would be lying. Is 
that correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What are you writing down there? 
 
MR. BAKER: Writing a note to his counsel. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You don't know that, Mr. Baker. He could be 
writing down the name of a witness. Who knows. I'm just asking. 
 
Q: What is that, Mr. Simpson? 
 
A: Something for my lawyer. 
 
Q: You don't want to share it with us? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall an incident in around Rockingham in 1986 when 
you hit Nicole and tore her sweater and slacks completely off? 
 
MR. BAKER: Why don't you frame your questions-- 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
MR. BAKER:-- Did an incident occur, instead of making it a fait 
accompli, especially in light of his past answers? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Did such an event occur? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Wasn't there an event when you took Nicole to a doctor, Dr. 
Martin Alpert, and told the doctor that she suffered an injury as a 
result of a bicycle accident? 
 
A: I may have taken her to a doctor, but I think she told the doctor 
that. 
 
Q: Was that true? 
 
A: I wasn't there when it happened. That's what she told me. I took 
her to the doctor, and that's what she told the doctor. 
 
Q: Do you remember the injuries that Nicole had on that occasion? 
 
A: Well, I don't think there was anything to see, but she told me 
she had a headache, so I thought she should see a doctor. 
 
Q: X rays were taken of her head? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you notice any wounds or bruises or anything on her 
when you took her to the doctor? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What did she tell you about how that injury occurred? 
 
A: She told me she was Betting off the bike and trying to get 
Sydney out of the back seat, the back thing that she was carrying, 
and evidently she fell back. 
 
Q: She fell back? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And you were not there at the time? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was it Dr. Alpert? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: But you didn't hit her on that occasion? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever go to Victoria Beach with Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That's near Laguna Beach? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Was there an incident where you hit her on the beach? 
 
A: No, never. 
 
Q: And she fell to the ground and cried? 
 
A: No, never. 
 
Q: Did you have an argument with her on the beach in Victoria 
Beach where she cried? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, if such a person saw that, he would not be telling the 
truth.  Is that correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
MR. BAKER: Who is "such a person"? Any person saw that? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Anybody. 
 
Q: Did you ever call Nicole abusive names when she was 
pregnant? 
 
 A: No. 
 
Q: Like, "You are a fat pig"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never said those things to her? 
 
A: Absolutely not. 
 
Q: Do you have a memory of what you do when you drink 
excessively? 
 
A: I don't think I really drink excessively too often, but, yes. I don't 
ever recall blacking out, no. 
 
Q: In the course of your relationship with Nicole, were you ever 
with her when you were drunk? 
 
A: When I think I was--would be called legally intoxicated, yes. 
 
Q: On a number of occasions? 
 
A: Over 17 years, I would say yes. 
 
Q: And on those occasions do you recall your behavior?

leaving the house after seeing an ice show? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you recall having a very heated argument with Nicole in 
Hawaii in 1988 because she let Justin kiss a gay man? 
 
A: Not particularly for that. but I do recall having an argument 
with her then, yes. 
 
Q: What was that about? 
 
A: We were--I don t recall what it was-- that portion was about. 
But I do recall what the argument was about. 
 
Q: What was it about? 
 
A: She called my father I t 
 
Q: And what did you do? 
 
A: I left. 
 
Q: Did you hit her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did this have anything to do with Justin kissing a gay man? 
 
A: It could have--the conversation --subject could have started 
then, yes. 
 
Q: And explain to me how it started. 
 
A: I don't recall how it started. I just recall that the argument 
started at a later time when she made a derogatory remark about 
my father. 
 
Q: Now, did you get upset with Nicole because you -because she 
permitted a man to hold Justin upon leaving a restaurant and kiss 
him? 
 
A: No, but I would have if I'd have saw it, yes. 
 
Q: You did not hit her on that occasion? 
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q: Do you recall an incident in which you hit Nicole in the rear of 
a limo? 
 
A: I never hit her in a limo. Or any other place, for that matter. 
 
MR. BAKER: I object to the form of these questions, "Do you 
recall, which is a fait accompli that such an incident occurred, and I 
object to those questions. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: Was there an occasion when you went 
with Nicole to a charitable fund-raiser at a Rodeo Boulevard 
nightclub and in the back of a limousine, returning home to 
Rockingham, you backhanded her with your hand and hit her in the 
face?

BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Do you recall an incident when you got into a heated argument 
with Nicole for-- You don't like the preamble. 
 
MR. BAKER: I really don't. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am not trying to trick him. I'm trying to find 
out information. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, you're--just ask him, "Was there an 
incident..." 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Was there an incident when you got upset with Nicole because 
she had just gone off to Aspen? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you were upset that Nicole was photographed in Aspen 
without you?  
 
A: I wouldn't have known if she was photographed without me. 
 
Q: And you shoved her against the Bentley. Did that occur?

Q: I am asking you. 
 
A: No, never happened.

Q: Yes, after your divorce. 
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q: This was 1992.

Q: Did you ever go to Aspen in order to find out who Nicole was 
with? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever go to Aspen separately from Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When Nicole was also in Aspen and so were you? 
 
A: No.

Nicole with another man? 
 
A: That's not--I can't answer, the way that's worded. 
 
Q: Why don't you explain to me what happened.

Q: Who were you with? 
 
A: An actor named Keith and a group of people that he had, girls 
mostly. 
 
Q: And who was Nicole with? 
 
A: Cora, Cici, Greer, I think this Keith Zlomsowitzh, and there 
were one or two other people there. 
 
Q: Did you talk to Nicole that evening? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: This was a time when you were separated from her. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And she had filed for divorce. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Before you met Paula. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you stare at Nicole during the course of this evening? 
 
A: I looked at her, yes, for sure, yes. 
 
Q: Why were you looking at her? 
 
A: Because she was there. 
 
Q: You were sitting at another table. Right? 
 
A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: And she was with another man. Right? 
 
A: She was with a group of girls. 
 
Q: Including another man. 
 
A: There was a guy in the group, yes. 
 
Q: Keith Zlomsowitzh. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: You had already seen Nicole having sex with Keith as of this 
time, hadn't you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That was later? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you stare pretty consistently throughout the evening at 
Nicole during this evening? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You just looked over? 
 
A: Looked over a few times. It was the first time I was ever in a 
restaurant with her and we weren't together in 15 years, yes. 
 
Q: That was the very first time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you say to her on that evening? 
 
A: I came over and talked to her and talked to the table, said hello 
to everybody that was there. Gave her a kiss. She gave me a kiss. I 
went back to my table. 
 
Q: Were you feeling jealous? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, shortly thereafter, do you recall an incident when you 
were looking through Nicole's window at her Gretna Green 
condominium and saw her having sex with Keith Zlomsowitzh? 
 
A: I couldn't answer that the way you worded it. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: Because when you say I was "looking," it gives the impression I 
was standing there looking in her window. No. As I--so I can't 
answer it the way you worded it, no. 
 
Q: Describe what you saw. 
 
A: I was walking to her front door, and her drapes were open on a 
window. As I was approaching her front door, I saw her, and I 
looked and saw her with--I didn't know who the guy was because I 
couldn't see the guy, and she was obviously involved in sex, so I 
left. 
 
Q: Was that oral sex? 
 
A: That's what it appeared to be, but I really couldn't see, but that's 
what it appeared to be. 
 
Q: Now, what time of evening was this? MR. BAKER: He didn't 
say it was evening. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Was it in the evening? 
 
A: It was at night. I would say it was midnight to 1:00 o'clock 
maybe, 11:00 to 1:00, somewhere in that area, I would say. 
 
Q: Were you invited to Nicole's house that night? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You just went on your own? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: This was during the time that you were separated and in divorce 
proceedings. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: When you saw her through the front window having sex with 
Keith or with this man, what did you do? 
 
A: I turned around and walked out, and I hit the doorbell as I 
walked out of her gate. 
 
Q: You hit the doorbell? 
 
A: Yeah. I just hit it so they'd maybe be aware that they were kind 
of in the open. 
 
Q: You mean that people could see? 
 
A: Yeah. If somebody was walking up to the front door, it'd be 
pretty tough not to see. 
 
Q: You didn't knock on the door? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you--How long were you at a place in front of her door 
where you were watching or where you could see her? 
 
A: Where I saw. Five to ten seconds that I actually saw, yes. 
 
Q: And did it bother you when you saw her having sex with this 
man? 
 
MR. BAKER: In what way? In other words-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI:  Emotionally. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, it could be emotionally because of his kids are 
there; it could be emotionally because of jealousy, and I think that 
the question is vague. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I think he can answer for himself, Mr.-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Well-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You don't have to feed him answers. 
 
MR. BAKER: I am not feeding him answers. I'm trying-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He didn't say anything about the kids. Why 
don't you let him answer the question? That's all. 
 
MR. BAKER: The question is vague and I instruct him not to 
answer. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: How did you feel when you saw Nicole having sex with this 
man through the window? 
 
A: I was stunned. 
 
Q: You were angry? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Jealous? 
 
A: At the time I was just stunned. It was just-- 
 
Q: Why were you stunned? 
 
A: Because I had been with her for at that time 15 years, and even 
if I had not been with her, I think I would have been stunned to 
see--if I walk up on anybody having sex, that would stun me, but 
that stunned me. 
 
Q: During that 15 years you were with her, l20 did you ever have 
sex with another woman? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Many times. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. That's irrelevant and immaterial 
to any issue in this case. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Your marital infidelity was the subject of constant fighting and 
disagreement with Nicole. Correct? 
 
A: I wouldn't say that, no. 
 
Q: From time to time, though. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. Or alleged infidelities. 
 
Q: you mean none of them was true? 
 
A: I meant there were times when we had arguments about things I 
wasn't doing. 
 
Q: And times you had arguments about things that you were doing.  
Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Was there any other reason you were stunned? 
 
A: I don't think I needed any more reason to be stunned. My kids 
were there. It was very open. It's just not something you would 
expect to see, l walking outside. You just wouldn't expect to see. 
 
Q: How do you know your kids were there? 
 
A: I assumed that they were there. If they weren't there, she would 
have told me and they would have spent the night with me or 
stayed at my house. I just assumed my kids were home. And the 
next day when I really found out my kids were home, she let me 
know that they were home. 
 
Q: But at that moment in time you didn't see your kids. Right? 
 
 A: No. 
 
Q: You didn't see them anywhere in the room, did you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And how late was it? 
 
A: I told you, it was somewhere between 11:00 and 1:00. 
 
Q: Now, the next day did you go back to Nicole's place? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what was your purpose in going there? 
 
A: I wanted to discuss that, what I had saw, with her. 
 
Q: And did she invite you over? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you call first? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And when you got there, did you knock on the front door? 
 
A: The kitchen door. I may have just walked in the kitchen door. 
 
Q: That's around the back? 
 
A: No. It's in the front. 
 
Q: Did you knock on the kitchen door or just walked in? 
 
A: Just walked in. 
 
Q: Did you have a key to that place? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you just walked in, where did you go? 
 
A: I called upstairs, and then I walked to the backyard. 
 
Q: No one was upstairs? 
 
A: Maria, I believe, was upstairs. 
 
Q: Maria who? 
 
A: Housekeeper. 
 
Q: Do you know her last name? 
 
A: Bauer. 
 
Q: Is she related to Nicole? 
 
A: Sister-in-law--I mean cousin-in-law. 
 
Q: She is the wife of Nicole's cousin? 
 
A: That's right. 
 
Q: Rolf? 
 
A: Rolf. 
 
Q: R-O-L-F 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When you called upstairs and Nicole wasn't there, what did you 
then do? Go outside? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What happened when you went outside? 
 
A: When I walked in the back, I saw Nicole in the bedroom. 
 
Q: In the? 
 
A: A bedroom that was downstairs. 
 
Q: Downstairs in the main house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you walk into the bedroom? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did you see in the bedroom? 
 
A: Keith was giving her a massage. 
 
Q: Were they fully clothed? 
 
A: Fully clothed. 
 
Q: Both of them? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you then do? 
 
A: I told Nicole I needed to talk to her. 
 
Q: Did you take her out of the room? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you talk to her right there? 
 
A: Yeah, after Keith left we talked. 
 
Q: She asked Keith to leave? 
 
A: Eventually, yes. 
 
Q: What happened during the moment when you got there and 
Keith was there? 
 
A: I told her we needed to talk about some things. 
 
Q: What did she say? 
 
A: "About what?" 
 
Q: What did you say? 
 
A: I told her I didn't want to talk about it in front of him. 
 
Q: You referred to the person as "him"? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Were you introduced to him? 
 
A: I had met him before. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: I don't know, but I had already met him before. 
 
Q: When you came in, did you say hello to him? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Shake his hand? 
 
A: At that time, no. 
 
Q: And did she then ask Keith to leave? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you talked to her then? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In the bedroom.? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you and she talk about? 
 
A: Basically about I wanted to know how we were gonna start 
handling this with the kids, and I told her that she, you know, has 
to be a little more careful, because I had seen them that night, and 
that in the future, you know, with the kids there, that she couldn't 
quite be that way. 
She agreed with it, and we d. Well, how are we gonna handle this 
with the kids?" 
And she said, "What? And I said, "Well, now that we're obviously 
gonna, you know, start seeing other people. The kids still thought 
we were girlfriend and boyfriend or man and wife. 
And her attitude was that it was a mistake. Evidently they had been 
drinking and doing some other things, and she said it shouldn't 
have happened. But my attitude was it did, and obviously now we 
would start seeing other people, and what was the best way we 
could handle it with the kids, and she talked about not really 
having guys stay over in the future and that that would never 
happen with the kids I in the house in the future. And it was just all 
that type of conversation, and that was it. There was no argument 
at all. 
 
Q: You could have waited and had that discussion with her at 
another time. Right? 
 
A: I guess so. 
 
Q: Could have called her on the phone and had it. Right? 
 
A: I guess so. 
 
Q: You could have made an appointment to talk to her also. 
Correct? 
 
A: Could have done many things. 
 
Q: But you felt the need to do it then and there. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So you're saying Nicole fully agreed with your attitude? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did she complain about your coming over unannounced and 
uninvited? 
 
A: No, because she did it to me; I did it to her at that period of 
time. Neither one of us was in a relationship, so it was just 
something that we both did. 
 
Q: Now, at any time when she was living at Gretna Green--By the 
way, she lived in Gretna Green after she moved out of 
Rockingham. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And that was shortly when she filed-- after she filed for 
divorce? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then she lived there from like January-February '92 until 
the end of '93. Correct? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And then she moved into Bundy from January of '94 to June of 
'94. Correct? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: At any time when she lived at Gretna Green, did you ever go 
over to her place uninvited, unannounced, other than these two 
occasions? 
 
A: All the time. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, I object, whether he is uninvited. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He said he was on these two occasions. 
 
MR. BAKER: That's okay. He can answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: If I can word it a little differently than you, we 
had a standard invitation to one another that I was always 
welcomed at her house and she was always welcomed at my house. 
So two or three times a week I would go to her house and have 
dinner with her and the kids and-without calling, or vice versa. 
I knew what time the kids ate, and I'd come over about that time, 
and some nights she showed Up at my house and some nights I 
showed up at her house. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Did there come a time when this arrangement ended because 
one or both of you got involved in relationships? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And when did that end? 
 
A: For me it ended that night. For her 
 
Q: What night? 
 
A: That night of Keith and her incident. For her it took a while for 
it to end. 
 
Q: When you say it ended for you that night, what did you mean, 
just to be clear? 
 
A: I didn't come over uninvited after that.  I would always call at 
least when I was on my way, and if there was a problem-- 
 
Q: Except you came over the next day. Right? 
 
A: Pardon? 
 
Q:  You came over the next day. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But after that you never came over there again without an 
invitation. Is that right? 
 
A: Without alerting her that I was coming. 
 
Q: Without telling her in advance. Right? 
 
A: Well, calling when I was on my way at least. 
 
Q: Did you ever go at night to the house and stand on the sidewalk 
and walk back and forth and try to look in and see who was there? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: This is either Gretna Green or the condo? Because, I 
mean 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Gretna Green. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Did you ever do that at Bundy? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: At any time did you ever go to either Gretna Green or Bundy to 
see what was happening and who Nicole was with and just sort of 
check on her whereabouts? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: All of the above? All three questions? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Any of those. 
 
THE WITNESS: Say them again. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Did you ever go to Gretna Green or Bundy to check on Nicole, 
to see who she was with, what she was doing, kind of looking and 
standing around the outside? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: That's the picture I'm painting for you. Okay?

A: No. I saw her car when I was coming down Lincoln Boulevard. 
 
Q: And then you followed her car? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You just saw the car go by? 
 
A: She was coming out as I was coming down Lincoln. 
 
Q: Did you stop and talk to her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know who Carl and Catherine Colby are? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who are they? 
 
A: I believe they live next door to Nicole. 
 
Q: If they saw you walking in front of Nicole's house on Gretna 
Green from time to time looking inside the window, would they be 
lying? 
 
A: Yes. Looking inside the window, yes. 
 
Q: Doing anything. 
 
A: I'm sure they saw me. I've been to Nicole's house so many 
times, I'm sure they saw me walking-- 
 
Q: Attempting to look into the windows? 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what that means. I don't know how you 
attempt-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You try to walk up to the window and see if 
you can see through. 
 
THE WITNESS: If they said that, they'd be lying, yes. That's not 
what they said. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: That's not what they said? 
 
A: Not in court. 
 
Q: What did they say in court? 
 
A: They said in court that they saw me on the sidewalk one night. 
 
Q: Do you recall that occasion when they saw you? 
 
A: That particular occasion, no. 
 
Q: Who is Bill Thibodeau? 
 
A: A guy who plays golf, that I know who plays golf. 
 
Q: Did you tell Thibodeau that you knew of a secret way or a back 
way to Nicole's house? 
 
A: I don't know of one, so I obviously didn't tell him that, no. 
 
Q: Did you ever tell Thibodeau "Sometimes she doesn't even know 
I'm here"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So if Thibodeau said that, he would be lying. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever drive up to Starbucks in Brentwood in 1994 and 
encounter Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Describe that incident to me. 
 
A: I'm sure that happened many times. 
 
Q: Where she would be at the Starbucks Cafe? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you would -- These are times when you're not together. 
Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When you went with her, you mean? 
 
A: No. My of office is one block away, and between her house, my 
house and the office, she goes there a lot, and I'm going to and 
from my office and stuff a lot. 
 
Q: Walking? 
 
A: No. Normally I'm riding. I think once I was walking to lunch 
and she was sitting there, yes. 
 
Q: And on any of these occasions did you ever stop and ask her to 
come talk to you? 
 
A: No. I--if I was there, she would talk to me. 
 
Q: Did you ever get angry at her because you wanted to know who 
were the men that she was talking to? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Never happened? 
 
A: Never happened. 
 
Q: Did you ever see her talking to Ron Goldman in front of 
Starbucks or in Starbucks? 
 
A: No. I wouldn't have recognized it if it was him. 
 
Q: When you saw pictures of Mr. Goldman at the trial, did that

A: No. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: May. 
 
Q: May.  And you began to date her. Correct? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you saw her for about a year before you stopped dating her. 
Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the reason you stopped dating her is because you began to 
date Nicole again. Correct. 
 
A: Essentially, yes. 
 
Q: And that occurred in about April of 1993. Right? 
 
A: April, May, June, yes. 
 
Q: How did that come about? 
 
MR. BAKER: How did what come about? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Your attempted reconciliation with Nicole. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, I think that's a... Let's just say, how did it 
come about that he started dating Nicole again. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: That's fine. 
 
MR. BAKER: Fair enough? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Fair enough. 
 
THE WITNESS: In March, I hadn't spoken to Nicole in a few 
months, and she finally sort of cornered me, and she showed up at 
my house with the kids and some video and a letter and crying, 
telling me she wanted to get back together. 
And I told her I wasn't interested, but for the next few weeks she 
just came by all the time and was sending me cupcakes and notes 
and tapes through the kids, and was just showing up everywhere I 
went. And I began to talk to her, and she was--she was relentless. 
She'd show up at the golf course, and it began to be a problem. 
So my mother told me I should, you know, get alone with her and 
find out exactly what it was-- what was happening with her.  I 
spoke with her mother.  And Nicole just told me she loved me and 
she hated what was going on in her life, and she wanted to get back 
with me, and for the kids she wanted us to get back together. And I 
told her that I'd start--okay once a week we'd start having dinner 
together with the kids and--but that didn't help, because she then 
began to show up at the golf course with her girlfriends and started 
taking golf lessons and started coming to my house. And I love 
Nicole, so it just got to the point that the time I was with her and 
the kids during this three-month period-- I had a conversation with 
Paula about it, and at some point, I believe it was in May, Nicole 
showed up at my house one morning when my m friends and I 
were going to Mexico and wanted to know where we were going, 
and I told her. 
Two days later Faye Resnick, her and the kids showed up where 
we were in Mexico, and during the course of that week Nicole and 
I had spoke a lot and I told her I think I'd be willing to try it under 
some conditions, and we ended up trying it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: What were the conditions? 
 
A: That she couldn't come in--she couldn't move back to my house 
and that I would do it for one year; that she could not move back 
into my house; there was a certain person that I would not socialize 
with, and there may have been one or two others. 
But the big condition was she was-- she really wanted to move 
back in and I wouldn't let her, and that became in a sense sort of a 
sore spot because it came up three or four times within the next 
year. But I figured at the end of a year, if it was working, I'd let her 
move back in, and I told her I'd give her the year, and that's what I 
gave her. 
 
Q: Who was the person that you didn't want to socialize with? 
 
A: A girl named Pam Greer--I mean 
 
Q: Robin Greer? 
 
A: Robin Greer, yes. 
 
Q: Is that a friend of Nicole's? 
 
A: Yeah. I've known her a lot longer than Nicole, yes. 
 
Q: Does she have a relationship to Rosie Greer? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: No relationship at all? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When did this reconciliation that you just described occur? Or 
the ground rules and the arrangement, when were those made? 
 
A: Right around Mother's Day of 1993. 
 
Q: As part of that did you tell Paula you would stop seeing her? 
 
A: Paula and I had dinner and talked about it. 
 
Q: And then you stopped seeing her. Right? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q: Was the arrangement with Nicole that neither of you would see 
other --have other dates? 
 
A: I don't think we ever really said that to each other, but I'm sure 
that was, you know, sort of an understanding, even though I never 
asked her if she was seeing anyone else during that period of time. 
I m assumed she wasn't, but I don't know. 
 
Q: Now, as part of this did you also have a discussion that both 
you and Nicole were to disclose to each other all prior relationships 
that you had had since the separation and divorce? 
 
A: No, but she did that to me. 
 
Q: She did? She volunteered that information? 
 
A: She volunteered that information. 
 
Q: What did she tell you? 
 
A: She just told me some of the guys she had things with. 
 
Q: And did you share that information on your part? 
 
A: At that time, no. 
 
Q: Later? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you also agree that you and she would remove all 
photographs and other items in the households about other persons 
in your lives? 
 
A: Not necessarily, no. 
 
Q: What do you mean, "necessarily"? 
 
A: When we came back from Mexico, I still had some pictures in 
Paula's house that for the most part irritated her, so I took them 
down, but I never m asked her to remove any pictures of her, and 
she didn't, of her and various guys that were in her house, and she 
didn't. 
 
Q: She didn't? 
 
A: She didn't. 
 
Q: You didn't tell her to take out all photographs of her other 
boyfriends? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you had no desire that she do so? 
 
A: Well, I wish she had, but she didn't, and that was the way it 
was. 
 
Q: Did you have a fight about that? 
 
A: When? 
 
Q: During this reconciliation period. 
 
A: It came up one night. In the midst of a fight it came up. 
 
Q: That she had photographs of other men? 
 
A: That they were still in her house, 
 
Q: Now, what was the reason, by the way, that you and Nicole got 
divorced back in 1992? 
 
A: What she told me was that she loved me, but she's been with me 
her whole life, that she just felt that she needed to be on her own. 
She just felt that, you know, that I was almost like a big brother or 
father to her, that all of our friends she had met through me, and 
that she just felt that she needed to in a sense spread her wings. 
And there was no argument, and we lived together for 30 days, and 
there was no arguments during those 30 days. 
 
Q: And it wasn't your idea to get divorced? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that correct? 
 
A: For the filing, yes. 
 
Q: And you hoped that you wouldn't get divorced. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: So you were not in favor of it. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you try talking her out of it? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you go into counseling with her? 
 
MR. BAKER: At that time? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Prior to her filing for divorce. 
 
 MR. BAKER: At any time prior to filing for divorce? Because-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Well, let's take--The two of you together, did you go into 
counseling let's say six months before the divorce? 
 
A: I don't--no, she wouldn't go into counseling. She didn't want to 
go into counseling. 
 
Q: Had the two of you ever been in counseling together-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --at the same time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many times? 
 
A: I can't tell you. 
 
Q: Who was the counselor? 
 
A: Bert Kitaen; there was a guy we tried once, but she walked out, 
and those are the two I recall. 
 
Q: So about May of 1993 you started to date her again? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On a regular basis? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you have any--Describe how the relationship evolved 
during that year. 
 
A: I don't understand. 
 
Q: How did it progress? 
 
A: I don't know what you mean by progress. 
 
Q: Did you get along? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Were there any conflicts? 
 
A: What do you mean by "conflicts"? 
 
Q: Did you have any big fights during that year? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When was the first one? 
 
A: The only--big fight? The only one we had was one. I think it 
was in October of '93. 
 
Q: And what happened? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
Q: What was the cause of the fight? 
 
A: The cause of the fight was something that a girl named Alex, 
who had been Keith's fianc. I was shooting a movie, and on the 
set of the movie she was telling me things in front of people about 
one -- things that Keith was saying about me and things that Nicole 
and Keith had done during the time we were apart. 
 
Q: This woman named Alex was saying these things? 
 
A: I think her name was Alex.  She was Keith's fianc or they were 
just splitting up, and Keith was in a drug thing or something, she 
was saying, and she shared some things that upset me. 
 
Q: And what did you do after you heard that? 
 
A: I confronted Nicole with them. 
 
Q: You went to the house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: This is in October of 1993. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, was Alex relating things that Nicole and Keith had done-- 
 
A: With her. I mean not sexual, but --not sexual things. 
 
Q: But before your reconciliation with Nicole. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: These were things that had been done in 1992. Correct? 
 
A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: Why did you feel the need to confront Nicole? 
 
A: Well, I confronted Nicole more with what she said Keith was 
saying about me and the subject matter of what she was discussing 
that they had all done in a restaurant. I didn't think it was right, So-
- 
 
Q: What was it? 
 
A: Drugs. 
 
Q: And you went to Nicole's house to discuss that? 
 
A: I told Nicole about it. 
 
Q: On the phone? 
 
A: On the phone and at her house. 
 
Q: Now, did you go to her house? 
 
A: I'm sure I did in that period of time, yes. 
 
Q: Did this conversation start on the phone? 
 
A: Probably at her house. 
 
Q: And how long did the conversation last? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Several hours. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And during the course of this conversation, you saw a 
photograph of Keith? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: In a photo album. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: With him and your kids? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or with Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That never occurred that evening? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So this had nothing to do with seeing a photograph of Keith. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is that the evening that the police came out? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What was the month? 
 
A: October. 
 
Q: Of 1993. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you and Nicole somehow resolve this disagreement? 
 
A: I can't answer that. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if it 
ever was resolved. 
 
Q: Did you get into a heated argument that evening? 
 
A: Which evening, now? 
 
Q: The one you're describing. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Now, how long after that did you have this incident when you 
came to her place on Gretna Green and the police came out? 
 
A: I believe it's three or four days later 
 
Q: What led to that? 
 
A: I was at her house for dinner, and she relayed to me that Keith 
had called and evidently was denying everything that this girl had 
said concerning me, and Nicole relayed to me that she told him that 
"OJ. understands you guys are split-up, and women will say 
anything, you know, when people are splitting up say things about 
one another. 
And I didn't particularly like her characterizing my attitude, so I 
went home. I told her I didn't like it, and I went home. 
 
Q: Just picked up and went home? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what happened next? 
 
A: She called me. 
 
Q: At the house? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what did she call to talk about? 
 
A: To remind me that I had always said that, you know, we should 
talk things out or I had agreed at some earlier date that we would 
discuss things, and how we gonna progress if I leave all the time. 
 
Q: And then what happened? 
 
A: I thought about that after a while, and I got in my car and went 
to her house. 
 
Q: Did you tell her you were coming? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What time was it when you went to her house? 
 
A: I don't know. Evening? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What happened when you got there? 
 
A: She was trying to move her cars, and there was something she 
was trying to do with her cars and garbage, so I got out of my car 
and sort of pulled her Ferrari into the garage. And we were talking 
during this exchange, and we walked through her kitchen into her 
patio, and she was smoking a cigarette and we were debating this 
whole thing. 
 
Q: And then what happened? 
 
A: Somehow in the midst of the conversation she threw Paula in--
got Paula into the conversation. Evidently while looking for a 
frame to put my kids' pictures in to send--because I had requested 
later pictures for my New York condo, and I guess she had some 
pictures blown up; and while she was looking for frames at my 
house, she came across a picture of Paula on the shelf where we 
keep all our empty frames and things in a frame. 
That evidently was a frame that once had n one of our wedding 
pictures in, and she yelled something about, you know -- 
uncomplimentary about Paula in our wedding album--in our 
wedding frame. And I at that point said, "What the hell are you 
talking about? Look at all of these pictures in your house." And at 
that point she turned to go into the house. I came--I was, you 
know, yelling, came behind her. She kinda slammed the door, and 
as I approached the door, I kicked it.  And we were both in her 
family room, and I was saying, "Well, look at all of these pictures. 
Who is this guy? Who is this guy? And I picked up an album and 
was going through my son's album, and I said, "Look here, I got-- 
for the rest of my life, I got to see this-- "Justin sitting on Keith's 
lap." And my attitude was, and I can't tell you specifically what my 
words was, "I never tell you to move any of these pictures. Who in 
the hell are you to be telling me about a picture that's on a shelf 
that's put away in my home?" And I assumed she was still 
downstairs, because we were having a big argument, and I think 
Kato arrived about that time, and I--you know, at one point I went 
into the kitchen where I thought she was, and she wasn't. And I 
don't know if you want me to continue to talk. You're asking me 
what happened. That's essentially what happened. 
 
Q: And you were pretty angry.  Right? 
 
A: I was pissed off. 
 
Q: And you were yelling and cursing. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you--when she closed the door, you kicked it open. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And broke it, in fact. Right? 
 
A: Well, it was--the majority of it was broke, which--the majority 
of it was already broke, which she admits to. 
 
Q: Who admits to? 
 
A: Nicole. 
 
Q: How do you know that? 
 
A: I heard the tape when she was talking to the police officer. 
 
Q: so you're trying to say you didn't break the whole door. Right? 
 
A: No. I think a part of it may have broke when I kicked it, yes. 
 
Q: Did you frighten her? 
 
A: I didn't see her frightened, no. 
 
Q: When you were yelling and screaming at her, do you think she 
was frightened? 
 
A: She was yelling and screaming back at me, so, no, I don't think 
she was frightened. 
 
Q: Do you think she feared that you were going to hit her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You don't think that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Isn't it true that most of that argument at that point was about 
Keith? Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you were yelling and screaming about Keith. Correct? 
 
A: He may have come up during the course of that argument, but 
that wasn't what most of it was about. 
 
Q: And in fact you started talking about something that occurred a 
year and a half ago when she was having sex with Keith. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. At one point she told me, after I went back downstairs 
and was venting at--venting to Kato my feelings about whatever 
we were arguing about, she said to me, "OJ., the kids," and I made 
a comment, "You weren't worried about the kids when you were 
sucking his dick here in the living room in the open, and I went 
back to venting to Kato how I was feeling. And at some point she 
came down where I was venting, and I assumed --she didn't appear 
afraid, because if she was afraid, why would she walk back into 
this room I was in.  And she said something to me, a couple of 
words we had with each other, and she picked up the phone, and I 
assumed she was speaking to her mother, and shortly after that the 
police came. 
 
Q: Did you know that she had called the cops? 
 
A: No, not at all. 
 
Q: so it surprised you when they came? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, you were saying much more to her about Keith than just 
that she had had sex with him in the living room. Right. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: you were going on and on about Keith. Right? 
 
A: About this asshole-- 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what "on and on" means. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: Q: "About this asshole"-- 
 
A: About this asshole talking about me like this, doing drugs. And 
during the course of this conversation Nicole revealed that this girl 
was a Heidi Fleiss girl. Evidently they were all together when she 
had her fight with Heidi that started that whole thing, and if you 
listen to the up you will hear me refer to Heidi Fleiss on numerous 
occasions. And I just was very unhappy with all of this crap about 
drugs, about hookers, and I wanted to know why she had brought 
these people into my kids' home, and I'm mad today when I think 
about it, yes. 
 
Q: But that was a person who was in her home more than a year 
before that incident. Correct? 
 
A: Yes.  Yes. 
 
Q: And you were still upset about it then? 
 
A: Because I had just become aware of it, yes. 
 
Q: Did you threaten to hit her? 
 
A:  No. 
 
Q: Did you tell her that you--Excuse me one second. 
 
MR. BAKER: Dan, we've got-- 
 
THE WITNESS: I can take a leak, too. 
 
MR. LEONARD: If he's on a roll... 
 
MR. BAKER: Is this a good time? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: No. Let me just finish up this area. (Pause in 
the deposition.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Okay. Did you say to Nicole on that occasion, "I'm leaving with 
my two fucking fists, is what I'm leaving with"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You deny saying that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: I ain't leaving till I've said what I'm saying." 
 
A: I could have said that, yes. 
 
Q: "You ain't leaving when I'm talking. "Did you say that? 
 
A: I don't believe so, no. 
 
Q: "Hey, I had to read this bullshit all week in the National 
Enquirer." Did you say that? 
 
A: I don't know about "all week," but yes. 
 
Q: Now, what week were you referring to where things came out in 
the Enquirer? 
 
A: Just prior to this there was a story in the Enquirer that evidently 
one of her friends gave, talking about how I had begged her to 
come back to me and I was--she was taking it day by day, the 
complete opposite of what the facts were, and it just irritated me 
that here I am, just back with her for four or five months, and 
already through her group of friends, they're writing about us in the 
National Enquirer, and I wasn't happy with that. 
 
Q: And that was the week of this incident in October? 
 
A: I don't know if it was that week, but it was previous to this. It 
was previous to this incident. 
 
Q: When the police came, you were still there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you were still upset? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you talked to the police? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And they didn't arrest you, did they? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: They treated you fairly? 
 
A: I believe so, other than the tape. 
 
Q: What tape? 
 
A: The surreptitious tape that they did. 
 
Q: How did you find out about a surreptitious tape? 
 
A: I heard it when I was in jail. 
 
Q: Who played it for you? 
 
A: One of my attorneys. 
 
Q: And what bothered you about that tape? 
 
A: That they would surreptitiously tape me and not turn it in as 
evidence and I assume use it for amusement for a year. I don't 
think that's proper. 
 
Q: But everything you said on that tape-- But what you heard on 
that tape is what you said.  Right? 
 
A: Yes. Yes. Not all of what I said, but what I said, yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, you can take a break. 
 
MR. BAKER: Thank you. I will ask your permission from now on. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, I know you will.

BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Now, in I984 there is an incident where you smashed Nicole's 
car with a baseball bat. Is that true? 
 
A: I hit her windshield, yes. 
 
Q: And you broke the windshield? 
 
A: It cracked, yes. 
 
Q: And where was the baseball bat when you got it? 
 
A: I don't know. Somewhere around my house. 
 
Q: And where was the car? 
 
A: In the front yard. 
 
Q: And you were arguing with Nicole where? 
 
A: I don't know if it was an argument. I wouldn't characterize this 
as an argument. We were having a discussion. 
 
Q: About what? 
 
A: Getting married. 
 
Q: About whether you should get married? 
 
A: Well, me not setting a date. 
 
Q: She wanted to get married, and you were vacillating? 
 
A: She wanted me to set a date, yes, and I was vacillating. 
 
Q: And did it then develop into a heated argument? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Where was this? Inside or outside? 
 
A: Outside. 
 
Q: Then you went inside and got a baseball bat and hit her car? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: What happened? 
 
A: I was outside when she came home.  She got out and went and 
used the bathroom and came back outside, and we were talking 
about this marriage thing. I was sitting on the front of her car 
talking, sitting on the side of the front of her car talking-- 
 
Q: Mercedes? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Is this on Rockingham. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Then what happened? 
 
A: I was bouncing the tire--I mean the bat off the tire. You know, I 
was holding the bat like this (Indicating), the nub of the bat, and 
we were talking, and between my legs inadvertently just bouncing, 
letting it hit the tire and bounce and bounce, and I gather it hit her--
it hit the hubcap a couple of times during this conversation, and at 
one point she walked up and looked and said, "If you dent that 
hubcap, you're gonna pay for it." And I went bam, and I said, "I'll 
pay for that, too." She said, "Yeah, you're gonna pay for it," and 
she went in the house and I guess pushed a button for Westec, then 
came back out and finished talking, and then we both went into the 
house. And at some point a Westec guy came, and we walked out, 
and he was there about a minute, and then somebody else came, 
who I'm told was Mark Fuhrman. 
 
Q: When you said, "I'll pay for that, too, "what did you hit? The 
windshield? 
 
A: The windshield. 
 
Q: Did you break it? 
 
A: It cracked, yes. 
 
Q: Did you swing the bat with two hands? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: One hand? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you just tap it or hit it hard? 
 
A: Hard enough to crack it. 
 
Q: You were right-handed? 
 
A: Hit it with my left hand. 
 
Q: Hit it with the left hand. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Where did you get the bat? From inside the house? 
 
A: No. I had the bat before. I hitting balls in the backyard. 
 
Q: Hitting baseballs? 
 
A: No. Actually I hit my old tennis balls. I had a tennis machine 
that pushes balls at you, and we played a lot of softball back then, 
and I used to have a weekly softball game. And I was hitting--you 
know, the machine would push balls out, and all at once I'd be 
(Indicating)--batting practice. 
 
Q: I see. And at any time were you fighting with her? 
 
A: No, not at all. 
 
Q: You wouldn't characterize this as a heated argument or 
anything? 
 
A: And she didn't either. 
 
Q: Why did she call Westec? 
 
A: Because she said, "You gonna pay for it," and I guess that was 
her way of making sure it was recorded so that I would pay for it. 
 
Q: She wanted security to come out and make a report about it? 
 
A: No, because she didn't give them any report when they came. 
By the time they came, it was like a past incident. 
 
Q: When the Westec officer, Mark Day, came out there, wasn't 
Nicole crying? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Didn't you smash the window and body of her car with the bat 
because she was trying to leave? 
 
A: No. No one has ever said she was leaving. She was not trying to 
leave, no. She had just got home. 
 
Q: You admitted breaking the windshield to Officer Fuhrman. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Officer Fuhrman treated you fairly on that occasion, didn't 
he? 
 
A: There was no reason for him to be there. We didn't call him. 
There was nothing for him to do, as he testified, and he left. 
 
Q: But he didn't mistreat you on that occasion, did he? 
 
A: No. If that was Fuhrman, no. He asked a question. I answered it. 
He asked her a question. She answered it. He stood there and 
looked and left. 
 
Q: So you deny having any kind of fight with Nicole on that 
occasion. Correct? 
 
A: We didn't get into--because as I said, by the time they came, it 
was-- whatever this was over. But it wasn't a fight. Neither one of 
us yelled at each other or anything. 
 
Q: Did Nicole ever do that on any other occasion, call Westec to 
come out? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You didn't scream and yell on that occasion? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: She didn't either. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And neither of you cried. Right? 
 
A: No. That's correct. 
 
Q: That's correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, from the period that you separated and she filed for 
divorce, January-February of 1992, until the time that she died in 
June of 1994, I want you to focus on that period. Okay? 
 
A: Till the time we separated-- 
 
Q: When she--Basically when your marriage ended. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Up until the time that she died. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: And you are taking that from January '92 to June of 
'94? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Correct. 
 
MR. BAKER: All right. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Did you ever hire anybody to follow Nicole? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Did you ever hire anybody to keep track of her activities or her 
whereabouts? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Did you ever have her followed by anyone? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Did you ever ask anyone to tell you what she was doing? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever stalk her? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Did you ever follow her without her knowledge? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Did you ever travel to another city where she was, without her 
knowledge, to see her? 
 
A: Unless she was in New York at some time that I'm unaware of. 
 
MR. BAKER No. To see her. Listen to the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Or to check up on her? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Did you ever--Did you call people on the telephone, like friends 
of yours or hers or family members, to find out what she was up to 
or what she was doing? 
 
A: No. No, no, no. 
 
Q: Isn't it true that you used to call Judy Brown numerous times to 
discuss Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And isn't it true that you--During this time period. Correct. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And isn't it true that you used to call Faye Resnick numerous 
times to discuss Nicole? 
 
A: Not necessarily, no. 
 
Q: During a certain time period, let's say the last three, four months 
of Nicole's life, you had constant conversations with Resnick about 
Nicole. Right? 
 
A: No.  But I had some conversations, when I was in Puerto Rico, 
with Resnick about Nicole. 
 
Q: When you came--You were in Puerto Rico in March of '94. 
Right? 
 
A: April. 
 
Q: April '94? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That's where you shot FROG MAN? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And right before that you were in Cabo San Lucas. Right? 
 
A: Yeah. For two days. three days, yes. 
 
Q: With Nicole. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you knew that Nicole had a --was frightened of frogs. 
Correct? 
 
A: A phobia about frogs. 
 
Q: Phobia.  That's the word was looking for. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And you once told her in Cabo that you were the frogman. 
Right? 
 
A: Yeah. They were asking me what was the script. Nicole was 
laying in my lap, many people were there, and they were asking me 
about the script, and I was talking about the script, yes. 
 
Q: And you told Nicole you were the frogman. Right? 
 
A: No. The people were asking about the script, and I think it was 
Faye that was asking, but it was numerous people sitting there, and 
they were asking me about the script I was reading, because I had 
to start work in two days on the script. 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you at that time that she didn't appreciate your 
saying that? 
 
A: No, not at all. 
 
Q: Did she get upset with you? 
 
A: No, not at all. 
 
Q: When you got back from Puerto Rico, you went back to Los 
Angeles. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: You didn't go out of town for any extended periods of time 
during May and June of 1994. Right? 
 
A: Extended" meaning? : Like more than a week or so. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And during that time didn't you have lots of conversations with 
Faye Resnick? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Wasn't Faye sort of acting as an intermediary between Nicole 
and you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You read Resnick's book. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: She refers to a--lots of conversations with you during that time 
frame. Right? 
 
 A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: Was that true, what she said? 
 
A: What she said in the book is virtually all lies but, as I said, in 
April when I was in Puerto Rico, I spoke to her a few times. 
 
Q: Virtually all lies? 
 
A: Virtually all lies. 
 
Q: From your own knowledge, you mean? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Have you ever talked to anybody about whether Faye's book 
contained lies? 
 
A: I think--aren't we getting into-- 
 
Q: Other than lawyers. No lawyers. 
 
A: Yeah. virtually everybody. I mean yes. Sorry. 
 
Q: "Virtually everybody." Who is that? 
 
A: Well, people I've come in contact, yes. 
 
Q: They've all agreed with you? 
 
A: All of them don't know her, but the people who know her agree. 
 
Q: I mean people who know whether or not the statements would 
be true. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who are such persons? 
 
A: Christian Reichardt, Cora Fishman, Ron Fishman. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: That would know firsthand? 
 
Q: Yes. 
 
A: Possibly Al Cowlings. I don't know how much he would know 
firsthand, but- 
 
Q: Anybody else? 
 
A: That I've spoken to. Oh, Judy Brown. 
 
Q: Anyone else? 
 
A: That would know firsthand-- 
 
Q: Yeah. 
 
A: --that I've spoken to. I don't think so. I just can't recall anyone 
else. 
 
Q: What about Chris and Bruce Jenner? 
 
A: I haven't talked to them. 
 
Q: And what about Candice Garvey? 
 
A: I have--I've never talked to her other than casual in public. 
 
Q: You maintain a current friendship with Ron Fishman? 
 
A: Yeah, we've always been friendly. I don't see him much, but 
when he brings his kids over and when my kids are around, yes, I 
consider him a friend, yes. 
 
Q: Consider him a friend, as well as Christian Reichardt? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Cora Fishman? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You see her frequently? 
 
A: When the kids are around, she comes around, yes. 
 
Q: Are you currently involved in a romantic relationship with her? 
 
A: With who? 
 
Q: Cora Fishman. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you been? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. This is absurd. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: It goes to bias, Mr. Baker. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Is the answer no? 
 
A: Yes.  The answer-- 
 
Q: Have you ever? 
 
A: Never, no. 
 
Q: Have you spent a lot of time, since you got out of jail, talking to 
Cora Fishman about Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: What's "a lot of time"? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: Many conversations? 
 
A: A few conversations, yes. 
 
Q: More than five? 
 
A: Maybe about five. 
 
Q: All in person. Right? 
 
A: I don't think so, no. 
 
Q: What has Cora told you about Nicole since you got out of jail? 
 
A: I don't know. You'd have to ask Cora. 
 
Q: I'd have to ask Cora? I'm asking you. 
 
MR. BAKER: He is not going to answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't remember. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He says he doesn't remember. 
 
MR. BAKER: We are not going to get into all these conversations. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, you know, Mr. Simpson is talking to 
important witnesses in the case, Mr. Baker, and that's important 
that we know what they are saying. 
 
MR. BAKER: So are you. You're talking to important witnesses. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: But I'm a lawyer. He is not. 
 
MR. BAKER: So what? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: He's a party. 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't understand the distinction. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, he could be saying, Cora, I want you to 
say is and that in order to help me in my case," and that would be 
highly relevant. 
 
MR. BAKER: You could be saying that to her, too, somebody 
from your office.  And I'm not saying you are, but I'm saying it 
certainly is equally as possible from your side as it is from his side. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: But, Mr. Baker, I'm not a witness in the case. 
 
Q: In any event-- 
 
MR. BAKER: I agree with you. 
 
 BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: --you did have such conversations, but you don't remember 
them. Correct? 
 
A: What's "Such conversations"? 
 
Q: With Cora about Nicole. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That's correct.  You don't remember? 
 
A: That's correct. Yes. 
 
Q: In that case, we will ask Cora. 
 
A: Please. 
 
MR. BAKER: I think we've already got her depo noticed. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You do? 
 
MR. BAKER: We do. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
MR. BAKER: There is no question pending. 
 
THE WITNESS: No question. I was just thinking out loud. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q:  Going back to that time frame now between January 1992 and 
June of 1994, did you ever keep a book in which you listed 
Nicole's whereabouts? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You know that one was found in Paula Barbieri's car? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Ever been informed of that fact? 
 
A: I heard some thief and--some guy made an allegation that it was 
but I didn't give it much. credence. It was like the National 
Enquirer or something. 
 
Q: That was just tabloid journalism. Right? 
 
A: A lot of what you've been asking me has been tabloid 
journalism. 
 
Q: What makes you say that? 
 
A: Because I saw it in tabloids. 
 
Q: You sold photographs to the tabloids, didn't you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: To the Star magazine. Right? 
 
A: No. I made a deal with a guy, and he sold photographs to them. 
 
Q: You knew they were going to be sold to the tabloids. Right? 
 
A: To the Star, yes. 
 
Q: Yes. So they're not all that bad, are they? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: What was your answer? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: In other words, you'll take their money. 
 
MR. BAKER: Do not answer that either. Be nice, Daniel. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Let's get back here. 
 
Q: I want to talk a little bit more about your relationship with 
Nicole during this time period. 
 
MR. BAKER: And we are in January of '92 to June of 1994? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Were you trying to convince Nicole to resume a relationship 
with you before you met Paula? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she was resisting. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when she was involved with Keith and other men, you 
were unhappy about that. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You were jealous about it. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: It didn't bother you at all? 
 
 A: Well, once she got involved with other men, and she had one 
incident with Keith, and by the time anyone else came into her life, 
I had just met Paula. 
 
Q: Was Keith the first man after your separation that you knew that 
she was involved with? 
 
A: Well, basically yes. 
 
Q: Who were the other men she was involved with during this time 
period? 
 
A: During what time period? 
 
Q:  January '92-June '94, if you know. 
 
A: A guy named Alejandro. 
 
Q: Alejandro. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Who else? 
 
A: As far as I know, that was it. 
 
Q: Did he have another name? 
 
A: I didn't know another name. 
 
Q: So the only two men that you knew Nicole was romantically 
involved with during that time frame were Keith and Alejandro. Is 
that right? 
 
A: I didn't know that. I saw her with Keith, and she told me right 
when it was over it was a mistake and a one night thing, and 
Alejandro I knew had been around, yes. 
 
Q: "One-night thing"? 
 
A: That's what she said. 
 
Q: To you? 
 
A: She said it was a mistake. They were drunk and loaded, 
evidently. 
 
Q: She told you this after you guys got-- tried to get back together 
again? 
 
A: No. She told me that the day that I came over the next day and 
spoke to her. 
 
Q: What day was this? The Zlomsowitzh day? 
 
A: Yeah. I've already told you this. 
 
Q: You didn't tell me about Alejandro. 
 
A: Well, you're now asking me about Alejandro. You were just 
talking about Keith. 
 
Q: I'm a little confused. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. He knows. It was clear. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I'm confused. I know that's not the test. 
Okay? 
 
MR. BAKER: That isn't the test? Thank God. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Are you telling me that the day you went over to talk about 
Keith, she told you about Alejandro? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Explain. When did you find out about Alejandro? 
 
A: Early on. 
 
Q: Early on in your relationship. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you later found out about Keith. Right? 
 
A: I saw her with Keith. It wasn't "find out." I saw her with this 
guy one night. 
 
Q: What about Joseph Perulli? 
 
A: That was after all this. She came to my house to talk to me 
about Joseph. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: The day after Mother's Day in '92. 
 
Q: What did she tell you about Joseph? 
 
A: That she had met a guy that she felt serious about, but she 
wasn't sure, and she wanted some advice from me. 
 
Q: What did you say to her? 
 
A: I told her to "Just be yourself. You're gorgeous.  What is there 
for him not to like, plus you ain't gonna cost him a dime." 
 
Q: Why is that? 
 
A: Because she was getting plenty of money from me. 
 
Q: Now, by this time had you met Paula? 
 
A: Actually, I met Paula two days after this. 
 
Q: So you still wanted to get back with Nicole when she came to 
talk to you about Joseph. Right? 
 
A: I would have, yes. I would have. 
 
Q: But you told her to do what she wanted. Right? 
 
A: No. I gave her the best advice I can give her. She found a guy 
who she liked, and if your wife told you that there's a guy that she 
was crazy about, I think you would move on, and that's what I did. 
 
Q: Did she tell you about any other men besides Joseph, Alejandro 
and Keith? 
 
A: As I said, the Keith thing wasn't a matter of telling me about it, 
and Joseph was a guy that she told me about, yes. 
 
Q: And you mentioned Alejandro. 
 
A: Yes, but I had knew about Alejandro. 
 
Q: What about a guy named Brett Shaves? 
 
A: I don't think he was in her life at this point in time. 
 
Q: I am talking about all the way up until 1994 when she died. 
 
A: Okay. Brett Shaves I found out about at one of our divorce 
hearings. 
 
Q: First time you found out about it? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And was that the only--last time you talked to Nicole about 
Brett Shaves? 
 
A: I didn't talk to her about him then. She just told me about him. 
 
Q: And that's the last time you spoke about Brett. Right? 
 
A: Yes. When we were back together, he may have come up a few 
times.  Any other men that came into her life during this time 
period that you and she discussed? 
 
A: What do you mean by "came into her life"? 
 
Q: In other words, men that she was involved with romantically or 
men that she was, dating and she--you found out about it one way 
or the other. 
 
A: There was a few guys, I can't recall their names. Marcus Allen, 
and a few guys I can't recall their names. 
 
Q: When did you find out about Nicole's relationship with Marcus 
Allen? 
 
A: I think it was the last week of March of 93. 
 
Q: This is before Nicole started pursuing you to resume a 
relationship with you? 
 
A: No. This was in the midst of her pursuing me to resume a 
relationship with her. 
 
Q: Is this, Mr. Simpson, after you and she agreed under certain 
conditions to see each other again? 
 
A: No. It was before then. 
 
Q: Before then. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And was Marcus Allen married at the time? 
 
A: No. He was planning a marriage at my house at that time. 
 
Q: And that marriage went ahead on schedule? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: That was a marriage to Katherine. Right? 
 
 A: Yes. 
 
Q: And they got married in your backyard? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: On Rockingham. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: I don't know. May or June. 
 
Q: 1993 was a couple months after this relationship between 
Nicole and Marcus. Right? 
 
A: Well, the incident she told me about. 
 
Q: Tell me the incident. 
 
A: He-- 
 
MR. BAKER: He told you that he heard about it at the end of 
March. I don't think there was a foundation it was a couple months 
later. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. 
 
Q: What did Nicole relate to you about Marcus Allen? 
 
A: That he had been coming around. Originally she was telling me 
that he wasn't my friend, that he was coming around. She started 
crying. We were at dinner. 
 
Q: You two alone? 
 
A: Yes. And that evidently something had happened at some point. 
 
Q: You mean they had sex? 
 
A: Yeah, in a manner of speaking. 
 
Q: That's what Nicole told you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: One time? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, Marcus was a good friend of yours. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And when you learned this, were you surprised to hear this? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Were you upset about it? 
 
A: Probably, yes. 
 
Q: And what did you do about it? 
 
A: I asked for a check. 
 
Q: And you guys went home? 
 
A: I took her back to her car, and I went home. 
 
Q: Did you then talk to Marcus about this? 
 
A: The following week. 
 
Q: You called him? 
 
A: No. He was at a friend's house that I was talking to in New 
York. 
 
Q: And you were there with him. 
 
A: No. I was at my house, my friend was in New York, and then 
Marcus was there. 
 
Q: Who was the friend? 
 
A: Mark Packer. 
 
Q: And what did you say to Marcus? 
 
A: I told him, "Marcus, do me a favor and ease up on Nicole, 
because whatever's happening with you is really screwing her up. 
She's like going bonkers." 
 
Q: Did Nicole tell you to do that? 
 
A: Yes, in a--yes. 
 
Q: What did she say to you? 
 
A: Well, when I dropped her off at her car, I said, "So, you know, 
why are you telling me this?" And she was saying, "Because he s 
calling me." And he just called the day, I guess, that day, and 
wanted her to meet him in Miami, and she thought it was wrong. 
And I said, "Why don't you tell him you're gonna tell Katherine? 
Why are you telling me?"  And she said she didn't want to screw 
Up his relationship, and that if I told him, he'd stop. 
 
Q: Did you ask Nicole if this was the first time she had had a 
relationship with Marcus? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did it stop then to your knowledge? 
 
A: I assume so.  To my knowledge, yes. 
 
Q: What did Marcus say to you when you suggested that he back 
off? 
 
A: He was in a room with people; he said nothing, but the next 
week I was taking a nap and he walked into my bedroom and 
apologized. 
 
Q: And to your knowledge that's-- that was the end of it? 
 
A: To my knowledge, yes. 
 
Q: Now, did you ever learn that Nicole was seeing Marcus again in 
1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: In about March, April or May or June? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did anybody tell you that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did anybody tell that you they saw his car at Nicole's place at 
Bundy? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did anybody tell you that he was in town during that time 
frame, let's say March through June? 
 
A: I played golf with him, so I'm sure he was in town. 
 
Q: And to the best of your knowledge, the subject of he and Nicole 
being together never came up. Is that right? 
 
A: Yes, that's correct. 
 
Q: There was a time in late--there was a time in May 1994 when 
you and Nicole ended your attempted reconciliation. Right? 
 
A: When I ended our reconciliation. 
 
Q: Why do you say you as opposed to both of you? 
 
A: Because I told her I couldn't do it anymore. 
 
Q: It was your decision, not hers? 
 
A: Yes, that's correct. I told her, "I gave it a year, the year's up, and 
I can't do it anymore." 
 
Q: And you at that time felt like you were; free and unattached 
from her. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
MR. BAKER: You mean romantically as contrasted to the mother 
of his children? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Romantically, emotionally, correct. 
 
THE WITNESS: Well, romantically. I don't know totally about 
emotionally. I was still concerned about her, yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: You didn't want to have a commitment with her anymore and a 
life together with her. Right? 
 
A: Yeah, I didn't want to deal with it, no. 
 
Q: You did not want to deal with it. 
 
A: Did not want to deal with it. 
 
Q: You wanted to be free of her. Right? 
 
A: No. I wanted her to get herself together, and I just couldn't deal 
with what was going on, and I just didn't want to be a part of it. 
 
Q: So in your mind at that time you viewed that as a temporary 
break-up. Right? 
 
A: No. I was just moving on. Just whatever was happening in her 
personal life, obviously I had spent a year with her, and I didn't see 
where I could help it one way or the other, and I wanted to move 
on and get back to what I had been doing before we got back 
together. 
 
Q: What I am trying to find out is whether then you were prepared 
to move on permanently from Nicole. 
 
A: As a lover, yes. 
 
Q: Lover-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: --spouse, in that way. 
 
A: Yes, in that way, yes. 
 
Q: Now, during that time frame after you said you made that 
decision, did you here about Marcus and she seeing one another? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever talk to Marcus after Nicole 's death to find out 
whether he was seeing her? 
 
A: I talked to him, but not to find out if he was seeing her again. 
 
Q: You talked to him about what? 
 
A: Well, he was a friend and he'd call, and I talked to his wife often 
from jail, Katherine, and when it came out that Nicole and he had 
had a relationship, I talked to Katherine a few times to kind of help 
her through it. 
 
Q: When is the first time you spoke to Marcus Allen after Nicole's 
death? 
 
A: He came to jail once, I guess, and he may have called--he and 
Katherine may have called that week from where they were. 
 
Q: That was the first time? 
 
A: The first week that I was--after the murder and the first week of 
the murder, I assume so.  So many people were calling me, I'm just 
assuming Katherine and Marc called--Marcus called during that 
time. 
 
Q: You were pretty upset with Nicole, after the two of you started 
to get back together in March- April of 1993, with respect to Keith 
Zlomsowitzh, weren't you? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: Pretty upset? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: In other words it was a subject that came up from time to time. 
Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You brought it up in 1993, right, in October? 
 
A: In October it came up, yes. I didn't bring it up, but it came up 
through Keith's girl, yes. 
 
Q: And the image of her having sex with him was still fresh in 
your mind. Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: you were sort of obsessed with her having that relationship with 
Keith. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Didn't bother you at all? 
 
A: Her with Keith, with Marcus, with any of them didn't bother me 
at all. 
 
Q: Not at all. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Is Keith the only man that you ever saw Nicole have sex with? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever threaten Keith? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you ever say anything to him that if he didn't get away from 
Nicole, he'd be sorry or words to that effect? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Did you ever attempt to threaten or intimidate him? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Who--Withdrawn. Did you enter the Mezzaluna restaurant one 
evening while Nicole and Keith were having dinner? 
 
A: I don't know. I don't think so. 
 
Q: Did you come into the restaurant and approach Zlomsowitzh 
and say "I'm OJ. Simpson and she's still my wife"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That never happened? 
 
A: Never happened. 
 
Q: So if Keith said that, he's lying. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, during this time when you were attempting a 
reconciliation with Nicole, let's say April of 1993 and for the next 
year, did you and she fight quite a bit? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: Not-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Generally get along? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you feel that the relationship was heading towards a 
permanent reconciliation? 
 
A: Only at one time. 
 
Q: When was that? 
 
A: Right before I went to Puerto Rico. 
 
Q: So from--And that was in April of 94. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  From the time you started this attempted reconciliation in the 
prior year up until April of '94, are you saying that there was sort 
of slow but continuous improvement? 
 
A: I'd say we got along, but I didn't --I didn't really want to--I had 
pretty much told her, if we worked out the year, we'd marry after 
that, and I didn't want to get married again, and I didn't think I 
would--I didn't think I loved her that way enough to marry her at 
the end of--at the end of the year, and I liked--I sort of liked the 
arrangement. I didn't want--as much as I wanted my kids, I just 
couldn't see myself living with Nicole forever. 
 
Q: When did you come to the realization during this time period 
that you didn't love her "that way" anymore? 
 
A: From the moment we got back together, I never felt that I could 
get it--I never felt I got it all the way back until right before I went 
to Puerto Rico. That was the first time I thought, well, maybe it 
will work. 
 
Q: Was there anything that happened in Puerto Rico that made you 
feel that way? 
 
A: Before I went to Puerto Rico. 
 
Q: Before you went to Puerto Rico. 
 
A: We just had a great couple of weeks We had a great time in 
Cabo. She came home from Cabo early and we had just a super 
weekend, and when I was leaving for Puerto Rico the next day I 
called her parents and I told them that I felt--you know, "I may be 
wrong, Judy, "--and Lou. I told them both-- "I may be wrong. I just 
had a couple of great weeks with your daughter, and maybe it will 
work." 
 
Q: What month was this when you-- right before you went to 
Puerto Rico after Cabo? 
 
A: This would have been the first of April, I believe, or the last of 
March or the first of April. 
 
Q: Did you have a confrontation with her at the Jenners' Christmas 
party in 1993? 
 
A: Sort of. Sort of.  Yeah. I would say sort of a confrontation, but 
not an argument, but sort of a confrontation. 
 
Q: You were at the party, and this guy Joe Perulli was there, and 
you got upset. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: That had nothing to do with it? 
 
A: That had nothing--Well, I mean, it wasn't about me being upset. 
That didn't make me upset. It was some stuff around it. 
 
Q: What happened that made you upset? 
 
A: That day Paula Barbieri and her mother sent a thing of flowers, 
a Christmas basket, and Nicole was at the house I believe with 
Cora Fishman and stuff when it came, and she was looking at it 
and she said, "Oh, what a beautiful basket," and when she looked 
at it, she saw it was Paula; she left. She got mad and left. 
That night-- 
 
Q: Where did she go? 
 
A: Home. And that night we were having people at our house, 
which we always have on Christmas Eve. We have a lot of people 
at our home, Mike, all the kids, and we had dinner scheduled for 
8:00 o'clock, but Bruce had invited us over, and since we weren't 
going to go over, we decided we'd go over and have a drink. And I 
think Nicole and I and the kids and maybe Kato, we went there, 
and at some point I guess Joseph came in. And shortly after he 
came in all, of  a sudden anybody who sat with me was saying 
things like, "Oh, OJ., she wasn't invited. He wasn't supposed to be 
here. " I think Chris Jenner said that. Cici said that. And when 
Nicole sat down and said that, I said, "You see, these things 
happen. I didn't know Paula was going to send these things, and 
now everybody's telling me this guy wasn't supposed to be here, " 
which I totally expected him to be there because, as far as I knew, 
he was one of Bruce's close friends. And I said, "You see, this 
Paula thing"--and I think she called me a liar or something.  And I 
said, "You think I'm lying about that?" And she says, "Yes." And I 
said, "Well, we've had our drink. k's time to go," and we left. 
 
Q: Did you order her to go? 
 
A: No. I called for the kids, and I walked out to the car, and she 
came out. 
 
Q: She wasn't ready to go, though. Right? 
 
A: Maybe she was. Maybe she wasn't. I don't know. 
 
Q: You left angrily. Right? 
 
A: I don't think I was angry. I wasn't yelling or screaming or 
anything, but I wanted to get out of there. It's Christmas Eve; I'm 
home for one day; I got to get on a plane on Christmas Sunday; I 
don't want to be sitting here having people tell me all night, or at 
least for the next I 5 minutes or 20 minutes, that some guy is there 
and he's not supposed I to be there. It's Christmas Eve. We should 
be in a 12n happy mood here. Let me go home where my kids are 
and where my meal is waiting and where my friends are waiting. 
 
Q: So did you argue with her in the car on the way home? 
 
A: No. She got in the car and said something and I said something, 
and that was it. 
 
Q: End of it. 
 
A: End of it. Not another word spoken about it. 
 
Q: So if Kaelin says otherwise, he's lying. Right? 
 
A: He didn't say otherwise. 
 
Q: He does? 
 
A: He didn't. 
 
Q: Have you spoken to Kaelin since you got out of jail? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Not one time? 
 
A: Not one time. 
 
Q: How do you know he didn't? 
 
A: I saw his statement. I heard him on the stand. 
 
Q: You have a pretty good memory of what people have testified 
to, don't you? 
 
A: Well, since I've been out--since I was in jail, I did a whole lot of 
watching, yes. I paid attention. 
 
Q: Took a lot of notes? 
 
A: To talk to my lawyers, I took notes, yes. 
 
Q: What happened after Puerto Rico to set you back with Nicole? 
 
A: Well, while I was in Puerto Rico, something was going on with 
Nicole. She was like-- she even said to me on two occasions she 
felt like she was having a nervous breakdown, but she couldn't 
explain why or what it was, and it was just--I would talk to her one 
minute, she was the Nicole I knew, and then if I talked to her the 
next day, she was somebody I didn't know. I expressed my concern 
to her mother while I was in Puerto Rico. I tried to get a hold of 
Cora, but she was going through her problems. I talked to Faye, 
who blamed it on Cora. 
And when I came home, I just--it was just something I did not 
want to have to deal with in my life. I just didn't want to deal with 
it anymore. 
 
Q: These were all telephone calls from Puerto Rico-- 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: To Nicole in Los Angeles? 
 
A: And vice versa, yes. 
 
Q: And when did you come back to LA. from Puerto Rico? 
 
A: The end of April, first of May. 
 
Q: And you came right back to Brentwood? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, did you go see Nicole? 
 
A: I spent the night with Nicole. 
 
Q: Did you tell her then that you wanted to stop the relationship? 
 
A: The next day I told her that I thought we need to go to therapy, 
and I needed her to go--I wanted her to go back to whatever she 
was going to. When she asked me to come back in the relationship, 
she prefaced all of that with the therapy she was going to and how 
it had helped her, and I suggested that she try that again and-- 
 
Q: With you? 
 
A: With me, without me, whatever. 
 
Q: And what did she say? 
 
A: She didn't know. She wanted-- she thought whatever the 
problem was, it was just--I think she kinda blamed it on her 
friends. She was l trying to help Faye with her drugs, help Cora 
with whatever she was going through with her husband, I and-- but 
as I said right before I came back from Puerto Rico--she had said 
"OJ., I'm sorry?" She apologized for the whole time I was there. 
She said, "I want to pick you up at the airport," which she did.  So I 
was sorta at a place where I'll try it, but I really kind of wanted out, 
and by the end of the week I totally wanted out. 
 
Q: W hat happened that week to cause you to make that decision? 
 
A: Saturday we were about to go to dinner, and she almost had a 
nervous breakdown. 
 
Q: Saturday when? 
 
A: Saturday in Laguna, probably about the 7th or 8th of May. 
 
Q: Before Mother's Day? 
 
A: The day before Mother's Day. And even though she was very--
she was fine on Mother's Day, the night before it was just too 
weird for me. 
 
Q:  What happened that night? 
 
A: I don't know. She slept All day. We went to a--we went to 
Denise's son's christening, and Nicole was rude-- 
 
Q:  To you? 
 
A: No. To Denise. Denise really had some horrible things to say 
about Nicole that day. 
And then Nicole went to our apartment and slept all day, and I 
woke her up at 8:00 o'clock to go to dinner. She got dressed, and 
when she got to the door, she just kinda flipped out. 
 
Q: What did she do? 
 
A: Just started yelling, "I can't do this" and "I don't know what's 
going"-- "Look at me. I'm shaking." And it was just weird. 
 
Q: Did she tell you if she was upset about something? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Was she better the next day? 
 
A: She was great the next day. 
 
Q: And how did you feel about her the next day? 
 
A: I just was looking for the time to --it was Mother's Day, so we 
had a very nice Mother's Day. We actually had a lot of fun, but I 
had made up my mind then that unless she went to therapy, I was 
not going to continue with the relationship. 
 
Q: Did you tell her that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q:  On Mother's Day? 
 
A: That night and the next day, yes. 
 
Q: Now, did you give her a Mother's Day present? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you give her an earring in which you had the diamond 
reinserted? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you give her anything? 
 
A: I think I gave her from the kids a Watchman, and I gave 
flowers. 
 
Q: You gave her no jewelry. Right? 
 
A: No. Around that time she had gotten some jewelry that had to 
be redone. Right around that time she had gotten it back, yes. 
 
Q: Did you have anything to do with that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did do you? Get it fixed for her? 
 
A: No. She lost them. 
 
Q: These were diamond earrings? 
 
A: Yes. And I had them remade. 
 
Q:  You gave them to her as a gift or what? 
 
A: No. To have them remade. 
 
Q: When did you give them to her? 
 
A: It was over a series of time, because when they first delivered 
them, they weren't quite the way I wanted them to be. So Nicole 
sent them back, and I had to reconfigure how the wanted them to 
be, and then it was around that time that they delivered it to her, 
you know. 
 
Q: Is this after Mother's Day? 
 
A: It was around that period of time. I don't know exactly when, 
but it was around that period of time. 
 
Q: Okay. Now, what did she say when you told her you wanted out 
on Mother's Day and the day after? 
 
A: I don't know. We talked, we ended up getting very affectionate, 
and we teased that this is what we should do, is split up all the 
time, because, you know, it was kinda hot. So it was fun, you 
know. 
 
Q:  It was fun? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: So at the end of the Mother's Day and the day after, what 
arrangement did you reach with her about your future relationship? 
 
A: That we would do everything we could to be good parents with 
the kids, and I think--you know, I think her attitude was, "Well, 
OJ., maybe we got back together too soon." My attitude was I wish 
that were true, but I just at the time was just ready to move. 
 
Q: So that was an agreement between the two of you that that 
would end your attempted reconciliation, and you would just see 
each other as friends from that point on. Is that right? 
 
 A: And for the kids. Yeah. And it was nice because there was no 
hassle, and we were both totally comfortable with it. 
 
Q: And that was the end of your romantic involvement with her. 
Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: That was the agreement. 
 
A: Well, you don't say, "Hey, we aren't going to screw again," but, 
you know, it was like, "Hey, we're split up," you know, yeah. 
 
Q: Did you have relations--sexual relations with her-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: --after Mother's Day? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When was the last time? 
 
A: Probably what we had the day after Mother's Day, roughly that. 
 
Q: Monday. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
 A: So after Mother's Day, after Monday, did you see her again? 
 
A: Oh, all the time. 
 
Q: But just to go visit and see the kids, that sort of thing? 
 
 A: And she came to my house. I think that week they were over 
one night, the latter part of that week, and slept at my house 
because it was too late to go to her house. We saw each other all 
the time. 
 
Q: She slept in a separate room? 
 
A: She slept in the bedroom that I was in. 
 
Q: Same bed? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Now, there was no hostility? 
 
A: None whatsoever. 
 
Q: No conflict at all? 
 
A: Zero. 
 
Q: Did she seem better to you? 
 
A: You know, because I don't have to deal with her on anything 
emotional and my mind was elsewhere, I really--you know, we 
were just dealing with the kids and stuff, and she was always good 
in than I mean, I never saw anything in that area of our life 
together. 
 
Q: Were you feeling better about having ended the relationship? 
 
A: I was feeling better that I was starting a relationship again or 
trying to get a relationship started again. 
 
Q: With whom? 
 
A: Paula. 
 
Q: And when did you start that up? 
 
A: The next day. I think it was Tuesday, the day after I split up 
with Nicole. 
 
Q: And you called Paula and said you wanted to see her again? 
 
A: No. Cathy told me Paula was coming through town for one 
night and was leaving the next day and was landing that night, and 
I asked her--I think--I don't know if she had a plane--a car--I'm not 
sure if she had a car or she asked Cathy to see about a limo, I don't 
recall, but in any event, I circumvented that and I went to the 
airport when Cathy told me she had no boyfriend as far as she 
knew and I kinda hid at the airport, and when I saw she was alone, 
I kind of surprised her. 
 
Q: Had you seen Paula at all during this attempted year's 
reconciliation with Nicole? 
 
A: I think I saw her once in--she was going through Dallas and 
once --maybe once in Florida. 
 
Q: Did you and Nicole used to argue over Paula during the year 
you were reconciling with her? 
 
A: I can't call it an argument. You know, the big fight that night, 
she brought up Paula, which, as I say, wasn't the genesis of the 
fight It was just a part of it. Christmas, obviously, that bothered 
her. Paula called on the day Marcus got married, and Nicole and I 
was hosting the wedding, and Nicole got mad. She didn't attend the 
wedding. She left. I think Cora and Sydney was there, and Nicole 
just walked right out of the house and didn't even attend the 
wedding that night-- 
 
Q: Because Paula called? 
 
A: Because Paula called to wish Marcus and Katherine--wanted me 
to wish them a happy time. 
 
Q: From the time you start up this 1 relationship with Paula again 
and ended with Nicole-- that's around May 10, I guess--until 
Nicole's death of June 12, you have about a month period there. 
Right? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: And did you continue to distance yourself more and more from 
Nicole emotionally and otherwise? 
 
A: I think I was--it was like an instant--when I say a relationship, 
an emotional distance, it was instant. 
 
Q: Instant when? 
 
A: That Monday. 
 
Q: That Monday after Mother's Day? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: Boom, you were able to cut it off. 
 
A: Yeah. Yeah. It was, you know-- there was no problem. It was 
over. But the other side of it, the kids and stuff, we were still very--
I think we were very close, and we both got accustomed again to 
doing things together with the kids. 
 
Q: Let me now focus on that last month. Okay? 
 
A: Okay. 
 
Q: During that last month, Mr. Simpson, I take it then that you 
never told anybody that you wanted Nicole back. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q:  And you never told anybody that you were upset because 
Nicole wouldn't let you back in her life. Right? 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: And you never told anybody during that last month that you 
wanted to kill her. 
 
A: Correct. 
 
Q: Did you ever tell anyone at any time that you wanted to kill 
her? 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Even if you didn't mean it. 
 
A: Never. 
 
Q: Never said it. 
 
A: Never. Never. 
 
Q: To no one? 
 
A: To no one. 
 
Q: You realize Resnick wrote that you said that. Right? 
 
A: Resnick-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Just answer the question. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes.  Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
 
Q: And that was false? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
A: And anybody else who would say such a thing would be lying. 
Right? 
 
A: Yeah, totally lying. 
 
Q: During that month did you have any further confrontation -- any 
other--Withdrawn. During that month did you have any 
confrontations with Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: I don't recall. Near the latter part of the month she called me. I 
was watching TV with Paula, and Nicole called me, virtually 
screaming at me. 
 
Q: What was she screaming about? 
 
A: About her friends. She didn't want me socializing with her 
friends. 
 
Q: Which friends? 
 
A: In this case, Faye and Christian. 
 
Q: You were socializing with Faye and Christian? 
 
A: No. Well, Christian and I were doing business together. I don't 
think we did any socializing together, but they--Christian was 
invited to the Cedars-Sinai affair that I sort of am involved with. 
 
Q: And what happened in that conversation? 
 
A: Then Faye--Oh, that conversation? Nicole--there it is. I mean, 
she was just yelling 1 about me socializing with her friends, and I 
didn't quite understand what she was yelling at me about. 
 
Q: How did you end that conversation? 
 
A: She hung up after saying something about Faye, and I had tried 
to tell her that I had not invited Faye. Faye had insisted on going. 
Plus I thought she was out of line to be calling me about this. What 
has this got to do with her. I never told her who to hang out with or 
not to hang out with. 
 
Q: Did she used to hang up on you often? 
 
A: She did a few times, yes. 
 
Q: Was that the last time she ever hung up on you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
A: What did you do? 
 
A: I went back to Paula. No. I called Faye and Christian. 
 
Q: And what did you tell them? 
 
A: Christian answered the phone. I asked him what was going on, 
and he told me that Faye and Nicole just had a heated conversation, 
and then Faye 1 came on the phone and I asked her what was going 
on. 
 
Q: And what did she tell you? 
 
A: She told me Nicole was upset, thinking 81 that I was taking her 
friends, and I said to her, "But didn't you tell her you invited 
yourself to this l thing?" And she says, "OJ., this is not about that. 
Nicole loves you, and you're back with Paula," and how would I 
feel if she was back with one of her boyfriends. And I told her, 
"Hey, that was her business. Faye, do me one favor: Call Nicole. 
Tell Nicole that you insisted on going to this thing." And then we 
said good-bye, and that's the last I knew of it. 
 
Q: Was that the end of your confrontation with Nicole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you have any other confrontations with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have any other arguments with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Disagreements with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you buy her a birthday present for her birthday on the l9th 
of May? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What did you buy her? 
 
A: I bought her a gold Cartier lighter. 
 
Q: Did you buy her an expensive bracelet? 
 
A: I bought a bracelet for Paula that I ended up giving to Nicole, 
yes. 
 
Q: When did you buy that bracelet? 
 
A: Same time I bought the Cartier lighter, within days, maybe even 
that day. 
 
Q: How much did it cost? 
 
A: Not much, maybe S5-, 56,000. 
 
Q: The what? The bracelet? 
 
A: The bracelet. 
 
Q: And the lighter? 
 
A: I don't know. Whatever that is. 
 
Q: And you gave both of those to Nicole for her birthday? 
 
A: I ended up doing that, yes. 
 
Q: Why did you change your mind about who to give the bracelet 
to? 
 
A: Because when the kids asked me "What did we buy mommy," I 
couldn't tell them that they bought mommy a cigarette lighter 
because they and me, we were anti-smokers, my kids, so I just 
gave her the bracelet from the kids. 
 
Q: Is that something that you decided-- When did you decide to do 
that in relation to when you gave the gift to Nicole? 
 
A: Spontan---We were literally-- they were literally signing a 
birthday card and lighting the birthday cake I had brought over, 
and I walked down to my car, got it out and came back up and just 
gave it to her--gave it to them, and they gave it to her. 
 
Q: What was her reaction? 
 
A: She was getting over the flu, so she was kind of laid up, and she 
liked it. She was--the bracelet surprised her. 
 
Q: Because it was such a nice gift? 
 
A: Because it was so different than anything I've ever bought her. 
 
Q: And did you intend that to be a gesture towards perhaps 
reigniting your relationship? 
 
A: No. No.  Just being nice. 
 
Q: Did she take it that way, do you know? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q:  Did she take it as a gesture by you that you wanted to resume a 
relationship with her? 
 
A: No. No. 
 
Q:  Did she give that bracelet back to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When? 
 
A: A few days--I went out of town, and when I came back from 
town, she spent a day at my house, and I believe that night--we 
were talking that night, and she inquired, "Did you" --"Why did 
you buy me this bracelet?" And I said, "It was your birthday." And 
it wasn't the type of jewelry I buy her. It was just totally different 
than anything I had bought her, and she sort of knew that, and 
when she said, "Did you buy this for someone else," and I said 
nothing, and she gave it back to me. 
 
Q: This was a phone conversation? 
 
A: No. We were together. 
 
Q: Where were you? 
 
A: At her house. 
 
Q: Was this on the 22nd or the 23rd of May? 
 
A: Maybe, yeah, right around there. 
 
Q: What was the reason you were there? 
 
A: Because I was home and she was getting over the flu and my 
kids were there. 
 
Q: What kind of bracelet was this that was a little different from 
what she normally got from you? 
 
A: If was sapphire and diamonds. 
 
Q: Was it intended for Paula? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And then you gave it to Paula? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you tell her you had given it to Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: He's not stupid. Come on. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: And to this day you have not. Right? 
 
A: Yes, that's right. 
 
Q: Now, did you ever make an arrangement with Nicole that she 
was not to date anybody until you went out of town in August? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Have you read that somewhere, that such an arrangement was 
made? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: Have you ever heard that? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell anybody that--Withdrawn. Did you tell Nicole that 
if she didn't lay off of other men until you left town in August to 
go back to New York, that you would kill her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell that to Faye Resnick? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or anyone else? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Didn't you have a pretty--Withdrawn. Didn't you have a heated 
argument with Nicole about your desire to get her back during this 
time frame? 
 
A: No. 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know what time frame we're talking about. 
Could you- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: 30 days before her death. 
 
THE WITNESS: No. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: No? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And isn't it true that she told you that she didn't want to have 
anything to do with you once and for all, and she wanted the 
relationship to end? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Isn't it true that she ended it. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Isn't it true that she told you that she didn't--she was finally over 
you for good? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she tell you just the opposite? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did she agree with you that the relationship was over? 
 
A: Well, she thought--she prefaced it with, "Well, maybe we just 
got back too soon." 
 
Q: But she accepted the end of the relationship those last 30 days? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And she was not making any effort to resume a relationship 
with you? Is that true? 
 
A: That's hard to tell. 
 
Q: So far as you knew. 
 
A: Well, I don't know. I didn't--I felt that maybe she was, but-- 
 
Q: What did she do to make you feel that way? 
 
A: She kept coming to my house.  She kept getting involved in my 
house and-- 
 
Q: What does that mean, "getting involved in your house? 
 
A: Oh, she'd come over-- 
 
Q: Did she have a key? 
 
A: I--she obviously did, yes. And she would--you know, like on 
the 22nd she came over. I was watching the basketball game, and 
3- or 400 people were at my house for a preschool thing. She came 
in while I was watching the basketball game and laid on my lap, 
and then she went up and laid in my bed. 
 
Q: Treated it like her home? 
 
A: Yeah.  And then she got into something with my housekeeper. 
She kept getting involved with my house help and-- 
 
Q: Gigi this time? 
 
A: Gigi this time. 
 
Q: What happened? 
 
A: I don't know. Gigi came to me and told me at some point during 
this week that she was--Gigi was upset and wanted to know what 
to do, that Nicole was upset with her. 
 
Q: Did you tell Judy Brown during this time period that you 
couldn't live without Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell anybody that-- 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: --during this time period? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell anybody during this time period that if you can't 
have her, no one can? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Or words to that effect? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Do you know how much Nicole had saved in her savings 
accounts around the middle of May of 1994? 
 
A: No. I hope she had about 7O or 80,000, but other than that, I 
don't know. 
 
Q: How much was she getting from you on a monthly basis. 
 
A: She? For what? 
 
Q: Spousal support. 
 
A: None. 
 
Q: Child support? 
 
A: About $10,000. 
 
Q: Did she have any other income? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Didn't you send her a letter written by your lawyer but signed 
by you telling her that she could get in trouble with the IRS and 
have to pay capital gains taxes? 
 
A: I don't think that's what the letter said. 
 
Q: To that effect, though? 
 
A: I don't know about that. I just didn't want her to use my address 
anymore because--it was more a letter to protect me, and also to 
keep her from coming over hassling my housekeeper. 
 
Q: You wanted her to remove on her tax returns your Rockingham 
address as her residence. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you knew that in doing so, that there was a possibility that 
capital gains taxes could be triggered. Right? 
 
A: I didn't want her to lose the house for my kids. That's why I 
insisted that she put that money into an account when she first 
came to me with the scheme. 
 
Q: What scheme? 
 
A: The scheme to not pay the taxes on the sale of her San 
Francisco condo. 
 
Q: What did she say to you? 
 
A: Actually, Michelle told me first. That Nicole told her--I was in 
New York--that the mail was coming to her house, and that if she 
got any calls, just to say she wasn't there. I called Nicole--Michelle 
asked me what did that mean. I called Nicole and I asked her, and 
she just started telling me all these things that--how much taxes she 
was going to have to pay on the sale of her San Francisco condo; 
that if she used it as a rental property, she wouldn't have to pay the 
taxes; and since she thought we were going to end up back together 
anyway, why should she pay those taxes. I told her what I've 
always told l everybody: "The government is your partner.  Just 
pay your taxes, Nicole. She said, "Well, why? You know, we're 
gonna live together, and it's about-- and she didn't say how much it 
was. And I said--after we spoke about it for a while, I said, "Well, 
I'll do it under, one condition: Call your tax man, find out how 
much money you would have to pay in taxes, put that money in an 
account, so if we don't make it and you have to pay the taxes, you 
have the money," and to my knowledge she did that. 
 
Q: When did this conversation occur? 
 
A: Right at the first of the year, right when she was moving into 
the place. 
 
Q: The place on Bundy? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: "First of the year" meaning January 1994? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: And she told you she put the money in the account? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And what was the amount of money that she told you she put in 
the account? 
 
A: I don't know. I thought she said --she made a reference with 
$70- or $80,000. 
 
Q: Which was pretty much all the money she had. Right? 
 
A: I don't know. I stayed totally out of her finances, including the 
sale of her houses, and I didn't even get involved advice-wise. 
 
Q: So when you sent her that letter, you knew that it would have 
the potential of generating a tax liability of about $90,000 for her. 
Right? 
 
A: No. I knew it had the potential to make sure that my kids 
wouldn't get kicked out of that house. 
 
Q: Kicked out of what house? 
 
A: The Bundy house. 
 
Q: What did that have to do with anything? 
 
A: If she paid the taxes, she couldn't lose the house. If she don't 
pay the taxes and they find out, she can lose the house and I could 
be liable. 
 
Q: How can she lose the house? 
 
A: Taxes. If they find her and they took the money and she spent it. 
It's happened many times. I think it was happening to Lou Brown 
at that time. 
 
Q: And you are taking this position with your ex-wife, and you 
knew that she was going to basically have to cough up her entire 
savings account to pay these taxes. Right? 
 
A: I don't know that at all. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that question. "Cough up her entire 
savings account"? Come on. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: You knew that she was going to have to use all of her savings, 
just about all of her savings, to pay these taxes. Right? 
 
A: These wasn't her savings. This is money from the sale of a 
house. I didn't even consider that a savings. A house that I had 
given her. I didn't consider that a savings. 
This was money that was the government 's. That 's the way I felt 
about it. If she was going to try to defraud the government, I didn't 
want to be a part of it at this time, and I had hoped that she would 
pay the taxes and have no problems. 
 
Q: Did you offer to pay the taxes for her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
MR. BAKER: "Why" would be the better-- 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes, yes.  Why. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Because you loved her. 
 
A: And because we had a divorce settlement, she was paid 
handsomely in the divorce settlement, so why.  I don't go around 
paying people--I don't pay Paula's taxes. I love Paula. I love 
Marguerite. I don't pay her taxes. 
 
Q: So you didn't want to pay Nicole's taxes. Right? 
 
A: No. Never even thought about it. Never even entered my mind. 
 
Q: How many times--Why did you write a letter to her? 
 
A: So that my tax man and my--and Skip Taft was actually--at 
Skip's suggestion, so that in the future if she got into any trouble, 
that they l couldn't come after me, and I would have a record in my 
file that would protect me if she didn't pay her taxes. 
 
Q: So you're saying Skip Taft told you that if you sent that letter to 
Nicole you would be protected? 
 
A: Yes. He told me that, "Write a letter; get a copy of it; we'll send 
it over, and so you'll have this in your files." 
 
Q: Now, your writing that letter had nothing to do with your 
feeling angry towards Nicole. 
 
Q:  Correct? 
 
A: No. At the time--what motivated it at the time was the fact that 
Gigi was telling me that Nicole's giving her a hard time, and I was 
trying to distance myself from Nicole. I had done the previous 
year; and If her mail wasn't coming to my house, that would give 
her less reasons to come over, and just whatever was going on in 
her life. I just didn't t want to be involved in that portion of her life 
that didn't concern the kids. 
 
Q: My question is whether you wrote the letter because you were 
angry at her. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And did you write the letter because you had just broken up 
with her? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And she was rejecting you. 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Didn't you write some early drafts of that letter that were a little 
vengeful in tone? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And didn't your lawyer advise you to tone it down and not be so 
vengeful? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Who wrote the letter? 
 
A: I think I dictated it, and Cathy must have typed it, 
 
Q: And you signed it Right? 
 
A: Yes. MR. BREWER: Are you going to mark the letter now, 
Dan? 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: If I can find it. 
 
(Pause in the deposition.) 
 
THE WITNESS: I have to go to the restroom. 
 
MR. LEONARD: Okay. 
 
THE WITNESS: Okay. I'll be real quick. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are going off the record now, and the 
time is approximately 4:29. 
 
(Recess) 
 
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the record now, and the 
time is approximately 4:34. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: I am going to mark as Exhibit 51 a two-page document dated 5-
26-94 from Taft to Simpson attaching a draft of a letter to Nicole; 
and as Exhibit 52, a signed letter from Mr. Simpson to Nicole 
dated June 6, 1994; and as Exhibit 53, an unsigned letter from Mr. 
Simpson to Nicole dated June 8, 1994. 
 
(Plaintiffs Exhibits 51 through 53 were marked for identification 
by the reporter and are attached hereto.) 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Now focusing on Exhibit 51, do you see that, Mr. Simpson, that 
document? 
 
MR. BAKER: Just answer that yes or no. 
 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: It's a two-page document there. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Mr. Taft had prepared the initial draft of the letter to 
Nicole. Right? 
 
MR. BAKER: You don't answer that. We are not going to answer 
anything relative to that. That's protected by the attorney-client 
privilege. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: What is? 
 
MR. BAKER: Document 51 and any communications relative to it. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, this document was a matter of public 
record, I believe, or was obtained through subpoenas. We certainly 
didn't have it. 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't know. I know that it didn't make it into the 
criminal trial; I'm pretty sure of that, on the same basis that I'm 
asserting now. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Do you know where this document came 
from, Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. BAKER: I do not know where that document came from. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: This document was made--this n document 
was one of the items on the property report, and this was one of the 
documents that all the lawyers, including your office, inspected at 
the SID offices and was turned over pursuant to the inspection and 
the court's order. 
 
MR. BAKER: Okay. That does not waive the privilege in my 
opinion, and I am going to assert the privilege. If this was taken 
pursuant to a search warrant, this is certainly not a waiver of any 
privilege. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Did you receive this letter? 
 
A: I don't recall, but I'm sure I must have received a copy of it. 
 
Q: You see where it says, "Made changes you wanted but did not 
get revengeful. Okay to" something "mail." Do you see that? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer anymore questions relative to this 
document. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Signed "Skip." You are not going to answer any questions about 
this? 
 
MR. BAKER: He is not going to answer any questions about this. 
 
Q: You had prepared an earlier draft that Mr. Taft revised. Correct? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, Mr. Baker, that's not privileged, that he 
had prepared, "he" being Mr. Simpson. 
 
MR. BAKER: You look over at David's monitor and see what your 
entire question is. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, the fact that Mr. Taft would revise it? 
Let me ask you this: Are you going to instruct him on that 
question? 
 
MR. BAKER: Yes. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: You had prepared an earlier draft than this one dated May 31. 
Correct? 
 
A: I had dictated a letter-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. Don't-- we are not going to talk 
about the May 31 draft, OJ. That's period, end of story. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker, we are now talking about 
something that he dictated, a draft letter to Nicole.  That's what he 
is telling me. And he had said this already. I know you are not 
going to let me talk about what he and Taft said to one another or 
wrote to one another, although I disagree. We can argue about that 
later. 
 
MR. BAKER: Sure. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I just want to find out what he did first. 
 
MR. BAKER: Relative to what? Hold on just a second. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: This process began with your dictating a letter to Nicole. 
Correct? 
 
A: No. To Cathy Randa. 
 
Q: You dictated a letter--Oh, for Cathy to type. Correct? 
 
 A: Yes. 
 
Q: But addressed to Nicole. Correct? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And Cathy typed it. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And did you see it after she typed It? 
 
A: I think she may have faxed it to me. 
 
Q: Where were you when she faxed it? 
 
A: I would have -- I don't know where I was when she faxed it, but 
I saw it in my home. 
 
Q: When did you see it? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: When did you dictate it? 
 
A: Probably the last week of May. 
 
Q: When is the last time you've seen that draft? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
Q: The draft that you dictated to-- that Cathy typed and that was 
faxed to you in your home. 
 
A: Probably the last week of May. 
 
Q: You haven't seen it since? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you tell Randa to destroy it? 
 
A: No. I told her to make some changes. 
 
Q: What did you tell her to change? 
 
A: Just some things. I thought it was too long and too wordy. 
 
Q: How long was the first letter? 
 
A: A full page. 
 
Q: A full page or four pages? 
 
A: A full page. 
 
Q: Full page. What did that letter contain or say in substance that 
this final--that this May 31 draft does not say? 
 
A: I don't know. I thought it sounded somewhat harsh. I thought it 
was a little long. 
 
Q: And you were feeling harsh towards Nicole. Right? 
 
A: No. That's why I had them make the changes. 
 
Q: But you initially dictated words that you felt were too harsh. 
Right? 
 
A: Pardon me? 
 
Q: You initially dictated words that you felt subsequently were too 
harsh. Right? 
 
A: No, I don't think so. I think the way Cathy--Cathy, when I give 
her a thing that I want written, she tends to shorthand it, and then 
she types it out to see how I like it, and when I saw it, I thought her 
choice of words in certain places were just a little too harsh. 
 
Q: When you say you dictated to Cathy, was this in person? 
 
A: Yes. I was probably in the office at the time, yes. 
 
Q: And she would sit across from you with a stenographer's pad? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
Q: And take handwritten notes? 
 
A: Yeah, she'd just take quick notes. 
 
Q: And then she typed it up and faxed it to you? 
 
A: Yeah. I left the office, and it didn't get--the day that I told her, "I 
need to send a note to Nicole," and I kind of dictated roughly what 
to say, and I think she didn't get to it for a day or so and then she 
faxed me a copy. 
And I thought it was a little too long, basically, and this is what we 
do with everything that we--every letter I send out, and I think I 
edited it.  And then I gather she edited it and showed it to Skip, and 
Skip called me, and I can't talk about what Skip and I talked about. 
 
Q: What was some of the material that Cathy--Withdrawn. Are you 
saying that the material that you edited out of the letter was all 
material added by Cathy on her own? 
 
A: No, I don't know. I just didn't like the way the letter read. So I 
didn't want to send--the way the letter read, I didn't like the way it 
read, so I wanted some changes in it. 
 
Q: What was harsh about the letter? 
 
A: I don't know.  Just in tone I thought it was harsh. 
 
Q: What did it say? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: What's your best recollection? 
 
A: I have none. My best recollection is what I see in this letter. 
That's the way I was-- 
 
Q: What did you think was revengeful about that letter? 
 
A: I thought it was harsh. 
 
Q: This is 8-A. This is your--this is Exhibit 8-A, the calendar that 
Cathy maintained for you. Looking at that calendar, can you tell us 
your best recollection of when you dictated the letter to Cathy? 
 
MR. BAKER: So it's clear, that's a calendar that she maintained for 
OJ. and perhaps herself, is the testimony. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Correct. 
 
THE WITNESS: I would say somewhere from the 31st--from the 
31st --somewhere around the 31st, 2nd --it was the lst, 2nd or 3rd 
of June also. So that week of the 31st. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: That you dictated the initial draft? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: That can't be, because the Taft letter is dated May 26. 
 
A: Well, maybe that's the last week of May then. 
 
Q: Well, looking--just looking at the date of the Taft letter back to 
you, which is May 26, that would indicate to you that your letter 
was dictated earlier. Right. 
 
A: Well, as I said, the last week of May, May 26th, I guess from 
my recollection would have been the last week of May. 
 
Q: Well, just now you said May 30 and into June, and I am trying 
to get a better date than that. So we know it was before May 26, 
correct, that you dictated letter to Cathy? 
 
A: It may even have been before this then, (Indicating). 
 
Q: That's what I'm saying. 
 
A: Yeah, because-- 
 
Q: That's what I'm saying. 
 
A: I felt it was the last week of May. As I told you when you first 
asked me the question, I thought it was the last week of May. 
 
Q: I am just trying to get your best recollection of when this initial 
draft that you dictated was created. 
You have the May 26 letter-- 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: --from Taft back to you, and you have the calendar in front of 
you. 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: You see the 26th of May is Thursday. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What is your best recollection or when you initially dictated the 
letter? 
 
A: Right in there, right in this week somewhere (Indicating). 
 
Q: From the 23rd, 24th or 25th? 
 
A: Yes. It wasn't until after I got back from--it was this weekend, I 
think, that Nicole gave I Gigi the hard time. 
 
Q: 22nd and 23rd? 
 
A: 21st and 22nd. I think that's the weekend she gave Gigi the hard 
time. So it would have been this week that I would have dictated 
the letter (Indicating). 
 
Q: You are pointing to the week of May 23. 
 
A: Yeah.  Yeah. 
 
Q: Can you remember anything in that letter that you edited out? 
 
A: Not particularly. I just thought it was long, and I didn't like the 
way it sounded. To me it sounded sorta harsh. 
 
Q: Can you remember anything that sounded harsh to you that you 
edited out? 
 
A: Pardon me? 
 
Q: Can you tell me any of the sentences or the tone-- 
 
A: No, I can't remember. 
 
Q: Or the words that you edited out? 
 
A: No, I can't remember.  But the way it ended up going to her is 
exactly the way I wanted it. 
 
Q: After Taft reviewed the letter, did you get a chance to see it 
before you signed it? 
 
A: I believe so. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You are not going to let me ask him about 
Exhibit 51, Mr. Baker? 
 
MR. BAKER: That's correct. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: We don't have to make any further record on 
that? 
 
MR. BAKER: I don't think so. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 
 
Q: After you got the letter from Taft, did you read it? 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Did you make any further changes to it? 
 
A: I might have. 
 
Q: You will notice that the version from Taft sent to you is 
different from the one you signed. The one you signed, by the way, 
is Exhibit 52. Is that correct? 
 
A: Yes. : You see your signature there? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And the one that Taft sent you dated May 31 is one paragraph, 
whereas the final version is three paragraphs. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you add those other two paragraphs? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well-- 
 
THE WITNESS: I don't know. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Excuse me? You don't know? 
 
MR. BAKER: Unless you added them without any advice from 
any lawyer. You can answer that question. 
 
THE WITNESS: Can I read it? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Yeah. What I want to know is whether you dictated in effect the 
last two paragraphs of the final version, which is Exhibit 52. 
(Witness reviews document.) 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: And the question was whether you dictated the last two 
paragraphs. 
 
A: I believe so, yes. 
 
Q: Now, in this letter you didn't say anything about Gigi, did you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Although, as you just testified, the Gigi incident had already 
occurred. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Now, let me ask you: This letter also, this Exhibit 52 that you 
signed and addressed to Nicole, was messengered to her. Do you 
see that. 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: It says "via Messenger." 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did she call you after she got this? 
 
A: No.  
Q:  Did she talk to you at all about it?  
A: No. 
 
Q:  Never?  
A: Never. 
 
Q: Is that correct, that she never talked to you? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you ever hear from anyone else about Nicole's receipt of 
this letter and reaction to it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: So when you sent this letter, that was the last that you had to do 
with this whole subject matter. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Do you know whether she did what you requested in the letter? 
 
A: What do you mean? 
 
Q: Did she change her--the address of her primary residence? Do 
you know? 
 
A: I believe that her mail during that period of time stopped 
coming to my house, yes. 
 
Q: This is a very serious sounding letter. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. 
 
Q: Do you agree with that? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer that. Your characterization doesn't 
make it so. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I am asking if he agrees with it. I didn't say it 
had to be so. He could say, "No, it's not. It's a frivolous tone." 
 
MR. BAKER: It has a sense of levity to it. Anything that discusses 
the IRS always has some levity to it. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: You wrote this letter because you wanted to frighten Nicole, 
didn't you? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You were upset with her and you were retaliating against her, 
and that was your purpose in writing this. Right? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: And you knew that she didn't want to pay taxes, and you knew 
this would frighten her. Correct? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Threatening IRS action-- 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't hold that in front of the video-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I didn't realize that I was going in front of the 
video. Was that in front of the video? 
 
MR. BAKER: The answer was yes. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you for pointing that out, Mr. Baker. 
 
Q: You may answer. 
 
THE WITNESS: What's his last question? 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Do you think it was threatening? 
 
A: I don't think it's threatening at all. 
 
Q: How many times had you written Nicole in 1994 a letter that 
you had messengered to her house? 
 
A: Many times. 
 
Q: What were the subject matters of those letters? 
 
A: My schedule, the kids, some -- whatever might have been 
happening at the time. 
 
Q: Letters that you had signed. Addressed to her, Nicole Brown 
Simpson? 
 
MR. BAKER: Wait a minute-- 
 
Q: Well, I want to make sure were not talking about different 
things here. I am talking about a letter like this letter, where it's 
addressed to Nicole Brown Simpson by OJ. Simpson. sort of an 
official-sounding letter. 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, don't answer that. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Did you ever write any letter like that? 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't answer the question. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: What were the letters you wrote to Nicole in 1994? 
 
A: Well, in '93 and '4--I'm trying to focus on '4. 
 
Q: Yeah, on '4. 
 
A: Probably more to do with my scheduling and stuff. My 
scheduling of things. 
 
Q: What kind of letters would you write about your scheduling? 
 
A: That if she was planning anything, this is my schedule. Cathy 
would send those letters. Or whatever was going on with the kids 
or something that I may have been planning to do or not planning 
to do, Cathy would dictate it and send it to Nicole. 
 
Q: The subject matter of those letters were children and family 
matters. Right? 
 
A: Scheduling, children, family matters, yes. 
 
Q: How many business letters did you write Nicole in the year 
1994? 
 
A: This is--I don't consider this a business letter. 
 
Q: You don't? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How many letters about the subject of money did you send 
Nicole in 1 994? 
 
A: Maybe one or two. 
 
Q: What other ones do you remember? 
 
A: Pertaining to this in the beginning of the year when she was 
doing all of these things with her house and stuff. 
 
Q: What did you write to her? 
 
A: Just pertaining to this, you know. I gave her my advice. 
 
Q: In writing? 
 
A: Once or twice in writing, yes. 
 
Q: Typed up? 
 
A: Cathy would have typed it up, sure. 
 
Q: Did you have your lawyer review it? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: How many letters did you send to Nicole in 1994 that your 
lawyer reviewed? 
 
A: In '94, I can't recall. 
 
Q: Your lawyer reviewed the letter of June 6. Right? 
 
A: Yes. This letter was mainly intended for the IRS if they ever 
came after me. 
 
Q: So to the best of your knowledge, the letter of June 6, Exhibit 
52, is the only letter you sent Nicole in 1994 that your lawyer 
reviewed. Correct? 
 
A: To the best of my knowledge, yes. 
 
Q: Do you still have copies of those other letters that you said you 
sent, the scheduling letters, family letters? 
 
A: I never kept copies of any of them 
 
Q: Cathy would have them? 
 
A: --except this. 
 
MR. BAKER: Let him finish, please. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Sorry, Mr. Baker. 
 
MR. BAKER: Go ahead, OJ. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Now let me show you--Would Cathy have copies of those 
letters? 
 
A: I don't know. 
 
Q: Did she destroy them? 
 
A: This one she should have kept a copy of. 
 
Q: Did she destroy any letters? 
 
A: Oh, I don't know. 
 
Q: Exhibit 53, do you see that? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And you have a copy right there. Mr. Simpson. 
 
 A: Yes. 
 
MR. KELLY: So what is 53? 
 
MR. BAKER: June 8. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: June 8 from OJ. Simpson to 15 Nicole Brown 
Simpson. 
 
Q: You dictated this letter to Cathy? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What was the purpose of writing this letter? 
 
A: To basically have Nicole take some heat off Gigi. 
 
Q: What had Nicole done to Gigi on May 21 and 22 that prompted 
this letter? 
 
A: She came over and yelled at her for not being at my home on 
that weekend, at least that Saturday. 
 
Q: Have you ever written a letter like this one to Nicole before? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Where you admonished her not to do certain things? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many times? 
 
A: Two or three times. 
 
Q: In 1994? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: When was the last time before 1 994? 
 
A: I would believe probably in 1993. 
 
Q: What was the subject matter of the last letter that you remember 
in 1993? 
 
A: I don't recall. 
 
Q: During this time frame, at least from June 6 to June 8 or 
thereabouts, were you having a conflict in your relationship with 
Nicole? 
 
A: I was avoiding Nicole, but these letters were dictated long 
before this. 
 
Q: When were they dictated? 
 
A: As I told you, that week in May. 
 
Q: Why did they go out weeks later? 
 
A: Because Cathy evidently was busy or not in the office or--and I 
wasn't around. I was in and out of town. 
 
Q: Why did-- 
 
A: They didn't go out weeks later, incidentally. I'm sorry. 
 
Q: Why is that? 
 
A: Because I told them not to send this one. 
 
Q: You told who not to send what letter? 
 
A: Cathy not to send the June 8th letter, 
 
Q: You never sent it? 
 
 A: Never sent it. 
 
Q: You dictated it when? 
 
A: Sometime in that week in May. 
 
Q: And Cathy didn't--Cathy, when she takes dictation from you, 
she takes it in hand, you said. Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Then she goes to her typewriter and types it. Right? 
 
A: Sometimes, yes. It depends on what time of the day I told her. 
 
Q: Did Cathy type this letter on June 8 to the best of your 
knowledge? 
 
A: I would guess so, if that's what it says. 
 
Q: When did you tell Cathy-- 
 
A: That's when I got it. 
 
Q: Excuse me? 
 
A: That's when I saw it. 
 
Q: When Cathy got around to typing the letter and showed it to 
you, you said "Don't send it." Right? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: But you did send the letter of June 6 that you signed. Right? 
 
A: I hoped it would suffice. 
 
Q: Exhibit 52. Right? 
 
A: That's correct. 
 
Q: Do these letters refresh your memory, Mr. Simpson, that in June 
of 1994 you were upset and angry with Nicole? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Angry toward her? 
 
A: I wasn't angry towards her. 
 
Q: Trying to separate yourself from her? 
 
A: I was trying to keep some distance from her, yes. 
 
Q: And was she resisting that? 
 
A: She came by my house a few times. So I wouldn't call it really 
resisting, but, you know, it wasn't easy staying away from her. 
 
Q: What did you say in that first letter that Skip Taft thought was 
vengeful? 
 
A: I don't think I said anything that he thought was vengeful. 
 
Q: Why did he say that? 
 
MR. BAKER: Well, don't answer that question. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Wait a second. 
 
Q: You wrote something in that letter which your lawyer said 
sounded vengeful. Now, without telling me what you and your 
lawyer talked about, because your lawyer here won't let me, tell me 
what you said in that letter that was vengeful. 
 
MR. BAKER: Don't-- 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: You may answer. 
 
MR. BAKER: Yeah, wait. Your interpretation of this is totally 
different than mine. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker-- 
 
MR. BAKER: I am going to instruct him not to answer-- 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: The simple answer is that he can answer the 
question, and you don't need Mr. Baker's able assistance-- 
 
MR. BAKER: I need all the help I can get. I'm not that smart, and I 
need all the help I can get, but you're making the assumption here 
that he took out changes that were somehow vengeful, and that 
doesn't say that, even though you want to get into this document. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker, something prompted Mr. Taft to 
use the word "revengeful" of every single word in the English 
language. Now, I want to know what Mr. Simpson wrote or said--
wrote in his early l draft that prompted that word. 
 
MR. BAKER: You know, your interpretation is totally different, 
and you're right into the attorney-client privilege in my opinion, 
and I am not going to let him answer it. It's that simple. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: You know, a judge once told me that you 
were a tough hombre. Now I know why. 
 
MR. BAKER: I'm not tough. I have been so nice--you know, 
because it's you, I have been so nice, it's unbelievable. I'm usually 
relatively harsh. Aren't I, Michael? And I've been an absolute 
modicum of decorum in this deposition. 
 
MR. BREWER: I'm glad it's being preserved on videotape, 
because no one would ever believe it. 
 
MR. BAKER: I am, too. Thank you very much. How far are we 
going to go today? Just because I'm tired. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Well, Mr. Baker, I will ask a few more 
questions and we will adjourn, and we can resume at 9:30. 
 
MR. BAKER: Fine, anything you want. I am just asking a 
question, but that's fine. I appreciate that. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: I don't want you to be tired. I want you to be 
on your toes. 
 
MR. BAKER: That's why I love this business. I really do love the 
interchange with lawyers. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Plus you told me earlier today that I'm much 
better in the morning.  
 
MR. BAKER: I'm not going to give away my secrets anymore. 
 
BY MR. PETROCELLI: 
Q: Mr. Simpson, you can't remember anything you initially wrote 
that was revengeful, in your opinion? 
 
A: No. I know I wouldn't want to be revengeful, and I know I 
wouldn't want a letter to go to her revengeful, and I think the letter 
that went to her reflects exactly the way I felt, and obviously the 
changes or whatever that were done to it reflected exactly what I 
wanted, which this covering letter mentions. 
 
Q: Did you talk to Judy Brown during the last 30 days of--
Withdrawn. I want to focus on the period when you ended the 
relationship with Nicole-- 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: --I guess it was around May 9, and when Nicole died on June 
12. 
 
A: Uh-huh. 
 
Q: Did you talk to Judy Brown during that time period about 
Nicole? 
 
A: Starting when? 
 
Q: That last 30 days. 
 
A: Yes, I believe so. 
 
Q: When did you last talk to Judy about Nicole? 
 
A: I'm guessing. I would say right when we split up. 
 
Q: To tell her that you were splitting up? 
 
A: No. To tell her about all my concerns about Nicole. 
 
Q: What did you tell Judy? 
 
A: Just the way she had been acting. I tried not to tell her about 
some other things that had happened, like the January incident and 
stuff, her drinking, the people she was hanging around with, 
because I tried in the year that we were together not to really get 
into that, but I had time and time again tried to alert Lou and Judy 
that when we all were together, to watch how much she drinks, and 
essentially that was the conversation, and the fact that I, you know-
-they were family to me, and she was Nicole's mother. Whenever I 
was concerned about Nicole, I'd call her mother. 
 
Q: After than that conversation, did you have any other 
conversations with Judy? 
 
A: I don't recall having any other conversations with Judy, no. We 
may have said "hi" or something at some point in time. 
 
Q: That was about it? 
 
A: That was about it. 
 
Q: After you told her about the reasons for your splitting up. 
Right? 
 
A: More my concerns. It was just more my concerns. We didn't 
talk much about having split up. I kinda wanted Nicole to go to 
therapy, and I talked about the therapy she had gone to before and 
how it appeared to have had a positive effect and how I tried to 
encourage her to do it again. and I would kind of stick by her 
through that. 
 
Q: Did you say to anybody, including Judy Brown, during this 
time period that, "If I find Nicole with another man, and I know 
she's seen with other men, I'll kill her"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: "If I find her with another man, she'd better stay monogamous 
to me until August when I leave and keep up the image"? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Did you have any kind of arrangement with Nicole about the 
two of you until August? Does that ring a bell? 
 
A: I told her at one point at this time that when I told her I couldn't 
do this anymore, that if she went to therapy, I'd stay with it until I 
go back to New York. So we can try it through the summer until I 
go to New York, if she goes to therapy. 
 
Q: You mean when you decided to end the relationship, you left 
this opening? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You said, "If you go to therapy, I'll keep an open mind"? 
 
A: No. I said--when I told her that I couldn't do it anymore, I said 
but if she would go to therapy, I would stay in the relationship until 
I go back to Buffalo--until I go back to New York. 
 
Q: What did she say? 
 
A: She didn't want to go to therapy. She didn't think it helped. 
 
Q: Then it was agreed upon and decided that that was the end. 
Right? 
 
A: I told her that was my condition: If she don't go to therapy, I 
wasn't going to do it anymore. 
 
Q: And that was it. 
 
A: That was it. 
 
Q: When you met Paula at the airport, did you say you surprised 
her? 
 
A: Yeah. 
 
Q: She didn't know you were coming in? 
 
A: Yeah. Well, I don't think she knew anything.  You know, part of 
me thinks Cathy may have told her, but she acted surprised, and I 
told Cathy-- 
 
Q: How did you know whether she might not have another man 
with her? 
 
A: Cathy told me that, as I told you already. Cathy told me that. 
 
Q: What did Cathy tell you? 
 
A: That she wasn't dating anyone. 
 
Q: But when you went to the airport to see Paula, you did not 
know for a fact whether she might be picked up by another man. 
Right? 
 
A: Yeah. No. I knew then that a limo was supposed to pick her up. 
I just didn't know if she was with somebody. 
 
Q: So you waited and saw that she wasn't? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How did you see that? 
 
A: With my two eyes. 
 
Q: When she came off the plane? 
 
A: Yeah. She walked alone, and that's when I snuck up behind her. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: In the airport, in the terminal. 
 
MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, we will resume tomorrow. 
 
MR. BAKER: All right. Thank you, sir.
